Are there other mitzvot repeated seven times? Which mitzvah is repeated the most times? Also, what are the various things learned by the mitzvot which are repeated seven times or more?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3143&size=1\">Baba Metzia 59B</a>) says, in the name of R' Elazar HaGadol, that 36 times in Torah we are warned against the wronging of a convert (46 if you count the times it says \"because you were strangers in egypt\" and the like - Tosafot). The reason given is because a convert has a strong inclination for evil, and you do not want to drive him back to his old ways.</p>\n\n<p>I just came across the Rimzei Baal HaTurim to Devarim 1:1 (printed in most Chumashim). There, he says that warnings against both Idol Worship and Wronging a Convert are mentioned 48 times in the Torah. (the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1578191300\">Artscroll Baal HaTurim Chumash</a> notes the discrepancy between the Talmud and the Baal HaTurim, but does not explain why).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This answers the question, but the discussion the question has come up whether there is a difference between mentioning something in the Torah, and being commanded about it in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know the answer, but right before the Gemara bring R' Elazar HaGadol's statement it quotes the Rabbis, who conclude that if one oppresses a convert he transgresses 3 prohibitions and if he wrongs a convert he transgresses 3 prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>I guess there are two ways of looking at this. The first way is that there is a difference between a warning from the Torah and a prohibition from the Torah (and R' Elazar and the Rabbis are not arguing).</p>\n\n<p>The other way of looking at it is that R' Elazar is arguing with the Rabbis and hold that when one wrongs a convert he transgresses 36 (or 46) prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>It is worthwhile to point out that the Kaftor V'Perach writes that a grandchild of the Rambam told him that while the Rambam was in Egypt he would sign his letters, \"Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, from Spain, who every day transgresses three commandments in the Torah [not to live in Egypt].\" (see <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/sukah/insites/su-dt-051.htm\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jewishhistory.org/maimonides/\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/245,2406/Why-did-Maimonides-live-in-Egypt-if-the-Torah-forbids-returning-there.html\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The Mechilta (Shemos 14:13) brings the three places where we are told not to return to egypt:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>\"You shall not return...\" (Devarim 17:16)</p></li>\n<li><p>\"... for as you have seen Egypt today, you shall never see them again\" (Shemos 14:13)</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Hash-m will return you to Egypt in boats, on the path of which I said to you, 'Never again shall you see it'\" (Devarim 28:68)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that the 3rd mention is not a commandment against going to Egypt, but a mentioning of the prohibition previously stated. Yet it is still considered a prohibition. This would seem to indicate that every time a prohibition is mentioned it is considered an added prohibition (even though it is only 1 of the 613 commandments)</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/961820/jewish/Negative-Commandment-179.htm\">Rambam Sefer Himitzvos Negative Mitzva 179</a>, where the Rambam first brings the opinion that for eating a Sheretz Hamayim one gets 6 sets of lashes, but then rejects that, since 3 of the lashes are for a singe prohibition, which goes against the rule in the Talmud that a person cannot get more than one set of lashes for every prohibition he transgresses.  </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam then says, \"<em>Have you seen those who propose this erroneous principle dictating two sets of lashes for a person who wears shatnez, since there are two prohibitions? I have not seen them say such a thing, and they would consider it strange if anyone else did.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>All this would seem to indicate that it is possible for the same thing to be prohibited many times, but a person is only punished once. It would seem however, that he is still considered to have transgressed many prohibitions (as indicated from the way the Rambam would sign his letters).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are a number of mitzvot mentioned many times.  Shabbat is mentioned at least 8 times that I can think of.  I recall that pidyon bechorot is mentioned 7 or 8 times.  If you count every exhortation to remember y'tziat Mitzrayim as a separate repetition, that would probably win, or possibly the prohibition of idolatry, which is also one of the more popular commandments.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not an exhaustive list!)</p>\n\n<p>I don't know that there's a set of midrash halacha based on the repetitions.  It's possible that the separate laws of meat and milk are learned from the repetition because the phrasing is identical; I don't know.</p>\n\n\n",

Noach originally aspired for his sons to be the Torah teachers in the world (like Avraham, Yitzhak and Yaakov eventually would be), but only Shem adopted the calling. That's why Shem/Malki-Tzedek is a kohen to God. Shem watched the 4 kings fight the 5 kings (all of whom were Shem's descendants) with the intention of snaring Avraham in the crossfire, and killing him. But Avraham stood up and risked his life to save Lot, and succeeded. From this, Malki-Tzedek understood that Avraham had the character traits necessary to be the primary Torah teacher in the world, and that Makli-Tzedek did not. So Malki-Tzedek went out to greet Avraham and pass the torch to him as the Torah leader of the world.</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah assigns a simple \"erech-value\" to people based on their age and gender. Thus if someone pledged to donate \"the <em>erech</em> of so-and-so\", s/he would look up their age and gender in the <em>erech</em> table and be obligated to give that amount of silver.</p>\n\n<p>A <em>neder</em> means a person vowed to bring a sacrifice. (See Rashi, Leviticus 22:18). So if a person said they hereby made a <em>neder</em> to bring, let's say, a <em>shelamim</em> sacrifice, s/he would be obligated to bring some appropriate animal as a sacrifice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>At face value, it would seem that the mitzvah of arachin is ‘powered’, so to speak, by nedarim. It is a pledge to pay one’s ‘eirech’ value, not unlike the neder one can make to donate one’s ‘damim’ value, i.e. his worth as a slave, to hekdesh. Despite their similarities, however, there is a fundamental difference.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish, in his introduction to Maseches Arachin, puts forth a yesod which transforms the simple understanding of the mitzvah. Here are his words:\nונראה, דענין הערכין אינו חייב מדין נדר את הסך הקצוב אלא ש\"נתפש\" במצות הערכין, וכענין התפשת נזירות.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of Arachin is not a glorified neder; rather, a person gets ‘taken’ by the mitzvah of arachin, much like a nazir is ‘taken’ by his nezirus. In other words, arachin is the process by which a person is makdish himself to Bedek Habayis, and therefore needs to be redeemed. That money is his eirech value. This is like a nazir, whose neder launches him into a whole new reality called nezirus. He becomes a different person. So too when one is ma’arich himself, he becomes the property of hekdesh, as it were, and thus needs to redeem himself.</p>\n\n<p>A simple nafka mina is bal yachel. A person who violates his neder transgresses the Torah prohibition of לא יחל דברו. A nazir who drinks wine, however, is not. Even though his nezirus is technically ‘powered’ by a neder, his new identity as a nazir places him in a new category, and he would only transgress the issurim directly stated in the parsha of nezirus. The same is true, says the Chazon Ish, by arachin. Because the obligation to pay is not a direct result of the neder, but rather of the pidyon that accompanies his newfound hekdesh status, failure to pay does not violate bal yachel.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, nedarim are a person's value as a slave, whereas arachin are a person being makdish 'himself', as it were, to hekdesh, and then subsequently being podeh himself for a preassigned value.</p>\n\n<p>As to how the values are determined, Rav Hirsch deals with it, and it was written on another post on Mi Yodeya <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7660/arachin-dependance-on-age-and-sex\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See also Alshich and Shiltei Giborim below for further sources.</p>\n\n<p>אלשיך: וההקדמה היא כי יפליא נדר והאמירה שאחריו הוא בערכך נפשות לה'. והוא לומר הנה דע לך כי ענין הנדר אי אפשר שיהיה לשום בחינה כיוהרא שהוא וותרן וכיוצא. רק על בחינת הפלאה שהוא לפרוש עצמו משטף דברים גופניים ולהתקדש לשמו יתברך. כי על כן אמור ערכי עלי <strong>למען תחול קדושה על עצמו מעין כל דבר שהוקדש ונפדה.</strong> שלא יבצר מלחול בו קדושה מהכין זה לו הכנה להנהיג עצמו בקדושה. כאומר בלבו איני אשר הייתי עד כה. כי עתה הוקדשתי לשמים ונתתי ערכי לה'.</p>\n\n<p>שלטי הגבורים ע\"ז דף ד. בדפי הרי\"ף: אינו נ\"ל קושיא די\"ל דגם <strong>האומר ערכי עלי הוי מקדיש שפיר כלי ידוע דהיינו גופו ועצמו שהוא מקדישו</strong> אלא שפודהו אח\"כ מיד הקדש בדמי ערכו ודמי למקח וממכר...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The spelling of the name פינחס Pinchas in Tanach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the entire Tanach the name Pinchas <strong>פינחס</strong> is spelled with a Yud. The only place the Yud is missing is <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%90_%D7%90/%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">שמואל א: א. ג.</a></p>\n\n<p>ועלה האיש ההוא מעירו מימים ימימה להשתחות ולזבח ליהוה צבאות בשלה ושם שני בני עלי חפני ו*<em>פנחס</em>* כהנים ליהוה</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 other Pesukim (שמואל א: ד. ד.\n & שמואל א: ד. יא) where the Bnei Aili are mentioned by name and there the spelling is also with a Yud.</p>\n\n<p>Why in this one location .שמואל א: א. ג is the Yud left out? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Minchas Shai that msh210 referenced in his comment in turn refers to Paaneach Raza, who <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39329&pgnum=194\">explains</a> as follows (paraphrasing a lot):</p>\n\n<p>The letter <em>yud</em> symbolizes the holiness conferred on a Jew by circumcision and the associated weakening of carnal pleasure (compare Rambam, Moreh Nevuchim 3:49). Appropriately, then, Pinchas, who risked his life to punish Zimri's transgression of this area of Jewish sanctity, deserves to have a <em>yud</em> in his name.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, Chofni and Pinchas, Eli's sons, are described as \"wicked people\" who \"lay with the women who gathered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting\" (I Sam. 2:12,22). R' Yonasan, in the Gemara (Shabbos 55b), explains that this isn't meant literally - their sin was that they \"delayed bringing the bird-offerings\" [offered by women after childbirth or unusual discharges], forcing these women to wait in Shiloh until their offerings were brought - but that in G-d's eyes this is tantamount to adultery, in that it was an interference with these women's marital life. The Gemara there continues by citing Rav's opinion, that Pinchas definitely can't have been guilty of actual adultery, since we find distinguished descendants of his serving as kohanim (compare Malachi 2:12); but that Chofni may well have committed such a sin, and Pinchas is held liable too, because he could have protested (and gotten Chofni to stop this behavior) but failed to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Paaneach Raza goes on to explain that this issue is reflected in the variance between the Eastern and Western mesoros as to the spelling of פ(י)נחס in I Sam. 1:3. (Though note that Minchas Shai says that there is in fact no such variation.) The letter <em>yud</em> also represents <em>yad</em>, a hand (such as might be used to stop someone else from sinning). Thus, he says, this variation can be explained in any of the following ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Western mesorah omits the <em>yud</em> from Pinchas' name there, to symbolize the fact that he failed to use his <em>yad</em> to stop his brother Chofni's actions. The Easterners keep it there too, to show the same thing but in reverse: he had a <em>yad</em> but failed to use it.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Westerners perhaps hold that Pinchas himself <em>was</em> guilty of some kind of immoral behavior (he doesn't say whether to the extent of the surface meaning of the verse, or just the exposition above about the women's offerings), and therefore lost his <em>yud</em>. The Eastern tradition holds with the Gemara, that Pinchas himself was blameless, and is taken to task only for not protesting his brother's actions.</p></li>\n<li><p>R' Yonasan would say (with the Easterners) that there's no reason to omit the <em>yud</em> from Pinchas' name, since after all his sin was only the delay in offering the sacrifices. While the Westerners, who omit the <em>yud</em>, would hold with Rav that Chofni was indeed guilty of actual adultery, and then Pinchas is held to blame for not acting like his namesake and stopping it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I like Alex's answer.</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that, according to the Zohar, it is quite possible that only one Pinchas (the one in Parshat Pinchas with the small yud) in the <strong>Torah</strong> is written plene, that is, <em>malei yud</em>. And all others it is written deficient, that is, <em>chaser</em>. See my two posts (<a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2009/07/should-yud-of-pinchas-be-small-part-one.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2009/07/should-yud-in-pinchas-be-small-part-two.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) on this matter, basically presenting Minchas Shai on Pinechas, where he strives to harmonize our present texts and the Zohar.</p>\n\n<p>If so, the difference between Torah and Nach is that Torah is earlier, and in general uses more chaser spellings, while Neviim and Ketuvim were written by different authors and later, when consonantal vowels were more in vogue. I have no ready explanation, within Nach, why there is one exception, just as no ready explanation why, in Torah, there is one exception.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I do have one. I don't know that you would like the speculation. But small yuds are to be as if not read (see e.g. the small aleph in Vayikra, and I can offer other examples as well). There might be the one exception in Shmuel to indicate its classic spelling, before diverging into the comfortable. And a parallel in the famous case in parshas Pinchas. Or something along those lines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: To clarify, I was just answering according to <strong>Zohar</strong>'s masorah, not according to the one established by Minchas Shai. Alex answers according to the one established by Minchas Shai, though I will add a bit below now.</p>\n\n<p>Also, As Rav Yosef says in Kiddushin 30a, א\"ל: אינהו בקיאי בחסירות ויתרות, אנן לא בקיאינן, that we are not expert in plene and deficient spellings of words. As such, I would be wary of making big deductions out of malei / chaser spellings across Tanach which might not even be accurate, and which Chazal themselves admitted as much.</p>\n\n<p>But, assuming it is as established by Minchas Shai, a counterweight to a midrashic / kabbalistic explanation, as provided by <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/ibn-ezra-on-aseres-hadibros-part-iii.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra</a>, in commenting on the divergences in the two accounts of the aseres hadibros:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאלה רבים ושניהם נכונים, כי הכתוב בלא וי\"ו אחז דרך קצרה ולא יזיק. גם הכתוב בוי\"ו לא יזיק בעבור שהוסיף לבאר. והנה הוי\"ו שהיא נראית במבטא הפה אין אדם מבקש לו טעם למה נגרע ולמה נכתב ולמה נוסף. כי זה וזה נכון. והנה על הנראה שיבוטא בו לא יבקש עליו בכתב טעם. א\"כ למה נבקש טעם בנח הנעלם שלא יבוטא בו. כמו מלת לעולם למה נכתב מלא או למה חסר. והנה בני הדור יבקשו טעם למלא גם לחסר. ואילו היו מבקשים טעם לאחד מהם. או שהמנהג היה לכתוב הכל על דרך א' הייתי מחריש.</p>\n  \n  <p>והנה אתן לך משל: אמר לי אדם אחד כתוב לרעי וזה כתוב: אני פלוני אוהבך לעולם. וכתבתי פלני בלא וי\"ו. אהבך גם כן בלא וי\"ו. לעלם חסר. ובא ראובן ושאלני למה כתבת חסרים?!\n  ואני אין לי צורך לכתוב רק מה שאמר לי. ואין לי חפץ להיותם מלאים או חסרים אולי יבא לוי ויודיעני איך אכתוב. ולא ארצה להאריך רק המשכיל יבין ועתה אפרש לך השאלות הנזכרות.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"And there are many like these, and both of them are correct. For the Scripture without the vav chose the short way, and does no damage. Also the Scripture with the vav does no damage, since it added so as to explain. And behold, the vav, which appears in the pronunciation of the mouth, no man seeks for himself a reason why it is missing and why it is written, and why it is added. For both this and that are correct. And behold, it is apparent that the one who pronounces it would not seek upon it, when written, a reason. If so, why should we seek a reason for the omission of that which is not even pronounced. Such as, in the word le'olam, why it is written plene (with a vav) or deficient (without)? And if we were to seek a reason for only one of them (malei or chaser), or if the general custom was to write all of them in one way (malei or chaser), I would have remained silent.</p>\n  \n  <p>And behold, I will give you an allegory. A person says to you, \"Write to my friend, and this is what you should write: I, Ploni love you forever.\" And he writes Ploni, פלני, without the vav {which is acceptable in Hebrew}, and אהבך, 'I love you', also without the vav. And לעלם, \"forever\" also chaser. {In each case you can have a cholam chaser as opposed to a cholam malei.} And then Reuven comes and asks me, \"why did you write them deficiently {chaser}? And meanwhile, I only have need to write that which he said to me, and I have no desire that they be either malei or chaser. Perhaps Levi will come and inform me how I shall write. I do not wish to go on at length. Rather, the intelligent person will understand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It would seem to me that an EMT, EMS member, doctor, nurse, or any other emergency first responder who is there at the time of death must rip Kriyah for all the places they respond to when a death of a Jewish patient occurs. Also a doctor who regularly see patients die must tear Kriyah every time, as he can lose many patients in a single day (oncology, cardiology). What is the approach with ripping Kriyah in these cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46539&pgnum=57\">Nit'ei Gavriel (Aveilus 4:4)</a> cites various sources that there is a common practice to not tear kriyah in this instance anyway (and in note יב he mentions other variations, such as leaving a button undone for a while, or tearing kriyah at the moment of death only for a distinguished person).</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46539&pgnum=58\">4:7</a> he also writes that it is indeed not customary for doctors or nurses to tear kriyah, and in note טז various reasons for this are offered - although he also cites a statement in the name of R.

My rav at the time paskened that I should tear kriya only if wearing my own shirt and the person who died was a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>See the Tzitz Eliezer 13:35   section ד on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14512&st=&pgnum=95\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I know of one doctor who did it when he was present when a Jewish patient died (and there was no family present).

    "content": "# If Eliyahu is Pinchas and Pinchas is a Cohen how was he in the Room when he did Revival of the Dead?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Melochim there is a famous occurance of the Eliyahu Hanavi reviving the Dead Child of Ovadiah's Hanavi's widow's child who some say was Yonah Hanavi. If Eliyahu was a Cohen how was he allowed to be in the room with him or carry him up to the attic room to perform the Techias Hameisim (revival of the dead)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Niddah 70b) records \"three nonsensical questions\" (שלשה דברי בורות) that the Alexandrians asked R' Yehoshua. One of them was, \"Would the son of the woman from Shunem [who was revived by Elisha, II Kings ch. 4] cause impurity?\" He replied, \"A dead person causes impurity, not a living one.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l analyzed this question and answer, along with the other two in that group, which also were related to questions of corpse tum'ah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16020&pgnum=167\">Reshimos #129</a>; <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15975&pgnum=248\">Likkutei Sichos, vol. 18, pp. 239</a>ff). He points out that they didn't ask about the earlier case of the son of the woman from Tzorfas (the one whom Eliyahu revived), because in that case it was his own original life-force that was returned to him. (This is implied in Eliyahu's plea to Hashem, \"תשב נא נפש הילד הזה על קרבו\" - \"let the soul of this boy return into him.\") By contrast, the boy whom Elisha revived actually received a new infusion of life from Elisha (Zohar II:44b). So they knew that the boy from Tzorfas, in retrospect, couldn't be considered \"dead\"; their question, basically, was whether the permanent replacement of one soul by another (as in the case of the boy from Shunem) could counteract the earlier cessation of life that triggers corpse tum'ah. (R' Yehoshua's reply was that it really doesn't matter; the fact that he's now alive automatically disposes of any possible tum'ah. This, indeed, the Rebbe says, is why the Gemara characterizes their question as \"nonsensical\": it turns out to be based on a flawed premise.)</p>\n\n<p>According to this approach, then, there's no room to consider Yonah as ever having been dead - hence no question about Eliyahu's being allowed to be in the same room as he. (This makes it exactly analogous to the case of the doctor that I mentioned in the comment to Avi's answer.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>In :בבא מציעא דף קיד Tosafot comments on  \"אמר ליה לאו כהן\". He says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה לאו כהן (אתה) - תימה לר\"י היאך החיה בנה של האלמנה כיון שכהן היה דכתיב (מלכים א יז) ויתמודד על הילד וגו' ויש לומר שהיה ברור לו שיחייהו לכך היה מותר משום פיקוח נפש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosafot raises the question of how Eliyahu could bring the child of the widow back to life if he was a Cohen?  The implication being that since the child is dead, the child would be טמא, and prohibited for a Cohen to come into contact with.</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot answers this question by suggesting that it was clear to Eliyahu that he could bring him back to life, so it would be permitted because of פיקוח נפש (saving a life).</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot is raising the question and provides an answer to your question.  For those who are just looking for a source,   this is a source.  However, I do have some questions on this Tosafot that I believe will lead to a clearer understanding of Tosafot. But it is an interpretation of how to understand Tosafot.</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot seems difficult because if in fact the child is dead then how will the principle of פיקוח נפש help?  The child is dead!</p>\n\n<p>If on the other hand the child was in fact still alive, then there is no problem for the Cohen to be in contact with a live child?  The child wouldn’t be טמא.\nEither way you go, Tosafot seems difficult to understand.  What is the premise he is operating with?  Was the child dead or alive?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps an approach I heard to answer this question revolves on two different definitions of מתה, death.  You could define מתה from the perspective of פיקוח נפש or you could define מתה from the perspective of the laws of טומאה.  </p>\n\n<p>The question of death by פיקוח נפש revolves around the issue of whether the person could be revived.  If the person is capable of being revived then פיקוח נפש applies.  It is the revive-ability that determines the status of the person.  This would be determined by the expert.   In the case at hand, Eliyahu was the expert that made the determination.  He knew that  שהיה ברור לו שיחייהו it was clear that he could revive the child.  </p>\n\n<p>However, by Tumah and Tahara the question of death would follow a different criteria.  The definition would be based on certain objective criteria.  The definition is concrete and objectified.  This would not be determined based on Eliyahu’s expertise through prophecy or what not.  It is a Halachik שם, status, that applies under certain conditions.  In the case of the child and Eliyahu, Tosafot presumes the child met the criteria for being טמא.    This would be regardless of the child’s ability to be revived.  </p>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, the child met the criteria for being טמא while simultaneously meeting the requirements for פקוח נפש.  Since in Halacha פקוח נפש allows one to violate the Torah (except for idol worship, murder, certain sexual prohibitions) to save a life, Eliyahu could become טמא in order to save the child. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Perhaps Eliyahu is not Pinchas.  However, Chazal are trying to indicate that there is a similarity in the personality and perfection of both of them. Eliyahu exemplifies a quality of Pinchas.   </p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra says explicitly that Eliyahu is not Pinchas in Sefer Bamidbar, Pasrshas Pinchas, Perek 25, Verse 13:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומלת אחריו - לאות שמת ואינו אליהו כלל וכבר פירשתיו כי נגיד היה עליהם וגם שהיה בימי פילגש בגבעה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't there a single, centralized Sanhedrin today?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems that many mitzvot in the Torah are opened to interpretation in some way, potentially subject to ruling by the Sanhedrin. And some mitzvot (examples below) seem to require the presence of the Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>In Maimonides' 613 mitzvot list, the presence of a Sanhedrin is required for carrying out some of the mitzvot. Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Sanhedrin must count seven groups of seven years Lev. 25:8</li>\n<li>The Sanhedrin must sanctify the fiftieth year Lev. 25:10</li>\n<li>The Sanhedrin must bring an offering when it rules in error Lev 4:13</li>\n<li>Israel must act according to the ruling of the Sanhedrin Deut. 17:11</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's my question: <strong>why isn't there a centralized Sandhedrin today?</strong> Now that the exile has ended, is it a matter of broad support in unifying the factions? Do some Jews believe there is no need? Are we waiting for the Beit HaMikdash to be built?</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia says there has been <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin#Revival_attempts\">one significant attempt in recent times</a> (2004) to reinstitute the Sanhedrin, but it doesn't comment much on the ongoing success of said attempt, and website it links to is dead.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The criterion for a Sanhedrin to have the powers that you enumerated (and a lot of others too) is that its members have semichah (ordination) that goes back, in succession, to Moshe Rabbeinu. Such semichah also has to be given specifically in the Land of Israel, so it died out when the Jewish communities there dwindled (depending whom you ask, anywhere from the 4th to the 12th century).</p>\n\n<p>The generally accepted view is that it will indeed require the coming of Moshiach - or to be more precise, of Eliyahu, who had semichah during his earthly life - for semichah to be reinstated.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Rambam (Hil. Sanhedrin 4:11) gives his opinion that \"all of the sages of the Land of Israel\" could join together and reinstate semichah on their own. The most well-known attempt to do so was made by R' Yaakov Beirav (a teacher of R' Yosef Caro) in 1538; it was opposed on various grounds - including the question of whether the Rambam's view is accepted in the first place - by other contemporary scholars (most prominently R' Levi ibn Chaviv and Radvaz), though, and so it never really took off. (I've heard of a similar attempt in the 1830s by R' Yisrael of Shklov, a disciple of the Vilna Gaon, but I don't know any details.) So there is no consensus on whether indeed this is possible in the present era.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The 2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin - the sixth such attempt - is apparently still under way, if reports of its activities from as recently as 2016 are to be believed. The current \"Sanhedrin\" includes not a few gedolim. It undertakes religious functions such as <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/218856\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">counting the yovel</a> and attempting to offer the <a href=\"https://library.yctorah.org/2010/03/korban-pesach-nowadays/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">korban Pesach</a>; it has also played <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_attempt_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin#The_debate_stirred_within_the_National_Religious_camp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">something of a role</a> in Israeli politics. However, it has received little in the way of official response from leaders of mainstream movements and is considered a fringe group by many. </p>\n\n<p>This effort is in part a response to the warning of the Eim Habanim Smeicha that \"The leaders will ultimately be held responsible for [...] their failure to try to unify the whole Israelite nation as one.\"</p>\n\n\n",

(<em>I believe this only answers why we say <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3738/20-years-for-sin-7-for-beauty\">Sarah was free from sin at 100 as when she was 20</a>.

Once they go up to heaven, however, they are judged for everything done after 13 years old.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Heavenly Court waits until one is 20 to see if they do Teshuva. Once the person reaches 20 without doing Teshuva, the person is punished for the sin he committed when younger.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Pardes Yosef on Parshat Chayai Sarah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41901&pgnum=154\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chapter 23</a>) gathers many different opinions about what it means \"The Heavenly Court does not punish someone under 20 years old\". It appears he includes most (if not all) of the opinions brought <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/daf-discuss@shemayisrael.co.il/msg00775.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (and more), as well as giving one of his own.</p>\n\n<p>The Pardes Yosef himself (I think) points out that heavenly punishment is stricter than earthly punishment, as is brought in Baba Kamma (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=2899&size=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">55B</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=2900&size=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">56A</a>). The Gemara there brings cases where the earthly Beit Din would not punish for actions (since they are too inconsequential), but the Heavenly Court will still extract punishment. When it comes to time, however, the Heavenly Court is more lenient, waiting until 20 to punish.</p>\n\n<p>This is because due to the public nature of the punishment. When the earthly Beit Din punishes someone, it is for their own benefit, since they will learn not to do it again. Even when he is killed by Beit Din, other people learn from this, and refrain from sinning themselves. This is good for others, and good for the punished as well, since this merit helps his atonement process. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when a person is punished by the hands of G-d, it is too late for him to learn from his punishment, and therefore G-d waits till the person is 20 before holding him liable for his actions. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Pardes Yosef continues, it says in Sefarim that when a person sins he causes a blemish on his soul, and Heavenly punishment wipes away these blemishes. A person under 20 has not yet achieved full intellectual maturity, and therefore the blemishes are not so great and do not yet require cleansing. (<em>He brings a proof from our Sages that a person does not reached full intellectual maturity until 20, but I am unfamiliar with the statement and he does not bring a source, so I can't look it up.</em>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org.il/learning/rabbizweig/5769/bamidbar.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a> Rabbi Zweig brings a different explanation in a similar vein.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>tl;dr: Either a) this applies only to negative mitzvos, which someone under twenty is more susceptible to break, so Hashem gives people under twenty a free pass, or b) this applies only to mitzvos sichlios, those that an intelligent and mature mind can determine are appropriate, so those under twenty are less likely to come up with them on their own and are not held accountable.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To further @Menachem and @ray's answers:</p>\n<p>The Chacham Zvi (Simman 49) asks two questions on the gemarra in Shabbos 89b that implies the Heavenly Court doesn't punish for sins comitted under twenty:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Milah</strong>, the Rambam (Hilchos Milah 1:2) and Raavad (ad. loc). sound like once a person turns thirteen and doesn't perform milah, they get kares.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pesach</strong>, the Torah says (Numbers 9:13) that an <em>ish</em> that doesn't perform the Pesach get's kares. <em>Ish</em> throughout the Torah means someone who is thirteen and above.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Magen Giborim (Orach Chaim 219, Shiltei Giborim 1) wants to answer these two questions (although he agrees with the Chacham Tzvi's conclusions) as follows: Those are both positive mitzvos. We can differentiate between positive and negative mitzvos.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Positive mitzvos</strong> even if they are broken above the age of thirteen have no earthly punishment. As such, they shouldn't get off scot-free, and  get heavenly punishment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Negative mitzvos</strong> involve succumbing to one's baser desires, and we can say someone under the age of twenty is more susceptible to giving in to his inclinations. Therefore, in Heaven they let earthly punishment suffice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, Rav Dovid Kronglass zt\"l, Mashgiach of Ner Yisroel (Sichos Chochmah UMusar #50) brings more questions on this gemarra: Why is someone between 13-20 whose ox kills another obligated to pay kofer, which is to prevent death by Heaven<sup>1</sup>. He also asks from the children from Sedom and the dor haMabul why they were punished. The explanation of the Magen Giborim isn't sufficient.</p>\n<p>Based on these questions, Rav Kronglass concludes the approach of the Chavos Yair (#166) and Chasam Sofer (Yoreh Deah #155) is correct, that the less than twenty idea applies only to <strong>mitzvos sichlios</strong>, meaning only to mitzvos that an intelligent and mature mind can determine are appropriate<sup>2</sup>. This explains Sedom and the dor HaMabul, who broke explicit prohibitions (gezel, arayos).</p>\n<p>I don't remember if he says this explicitly, but it would then follow that the age of twenty is determined because until that age a person can't be expected to be mature enough to realize what should and shouldn't be prohibited on their own.</p>\n<p>See Teshuvos HaRashba 6:179, who explains that someone under twenty cannot judge capital cases, because they aren't mature enough yet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאין אדם עומד על שלמות דעתו עד שיהא בן עשרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> He proves they're obligated from Bava Kama 40a which states a child is exempt and the Rambam (Hilchos Nizkei Mammon 10:6) who says children, deafmutes and deranged people are exempt <strong>due to not being obligated in mitzvos</strong> (לאו בני חיוב). Therefore, a child who is obligated in mitzvos (13-20) is obligated in kofer.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Cf. the Chidah (Nachal Kadmonim parshas Chayei Sarah #2) who says that the Chacham Zvi's approach isn't the simple reading of the gemarra, and I would venture to say he would say the same about this approach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I heard a shiur by Rabbi Uziel Milevsky who explains as follows.</p>\n\n<p>the earth beis din punishes the ACT only. when a person reaches 13 he is a man and therefore his act is a full act.</p>\n\n<p>the heavenly beis din looks also at the motives, maturity level, etc. and since a person does not fully know what he is doing until 20 the he is exempt until then</p>\n\n\n",

(This doesn't explain why the gap is specifically a year, though. Perhaps it's because if for a boy the key date is an integral number of years, then by analogy, for a girl it has to be too - and since תפסת מרובה לא תפסת, there's no reason to assume that there's any more than one year's difference.)</p>\n\n<p>The verse about Levi, by the way, is (I think) considered an asmachta, not an actual source for the law. (This is especially so, because (a) we usually don't derive precedents from pre-Sinaitic events, and (b) in this case, as Dave pointed out in the comments to that question, the physiological facts seem to have changed between Levi's time and the Talmudic era.) So there may indeed not be a parallel one using the term אשה. (Indeed, Rivkah is referred to as an אשה repeatedly in Gen. 24, and according to various opinions she was either three or fourteen years old at the time, not twelve.)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the OU has an <a href=\"http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/product_search\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">online database</a> (although some items are not in it).

As always, consult with your local Halchic authority.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding darts there is a very thorough rundown <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/47797\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can we play darts on Shabbat? (Additional information requested – the darts are classic ones that pierce the board’s surface; the board hangs loosely from a nail in the wall; in between uses, the darts often stay on the board.)</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are several possible problems to resolve before we can permit this.</p>\n<p>Tofer (sewing) – It is forbidden to attach two objects or two parts of an object to each other by stitching or the equivalent (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.340.27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 340:27</a>). One can claim that connecting darts to the board is considered tofer. A full violation requires at least two stitches (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.73a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 73a</a>) and here every dart is connected in only one place, but it could still be a Rabbinic prohibition. On the other hand, certain types of connections are permitted because they are for temporary opening/closing, e.g., buttons, zippers (Orchot Shabbat 11:7-8). One can argue that likewise the nature of the darts game is to connect them just long enough to see how many you placed where. Regarding the very similar case of using one thumbtack to attach a note to a bulletin board, Piskei Teshuvot (313:(157)) distinguishes between setups based on how long they are likely to stay pinned. In this case, the game would not be a problem, but leaving the darts on the board or removing them when starting to play could be. However, it is not clear that this is so for a flimsy, single connection. Also, the fact that the dart is not connecting two things but connecting itself flimsily may preclude it from being tofer (Orchot Shabbat 11:(14)).</p>\n<p>Boneh (Building) – 1) The dart being attached to the board changes the board. However, having darts in the board in no way improves the board; it is just a fleeting situation of the game or a meaningless one during storage. Furthermore, since the dart board is only hanging from a nail and not itself attached to the wall, we are dealing with the more lenient matter of building utensils. Therefore, if one connects them lightly (e.g., a dart in its board), and especially if it is by nature a weak connection, this is not a violation of building a utensil (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.313.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 313:6</a>).</p>\n<p>Boneh - 2) It is forbidden to attach a nail to a structure (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.103a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 103a</a>). This applies not just to a building/something attached to the ground, but even to a movable object (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.314.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 314:8</a>). However, the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/150744/p/7/t/7035829481234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">K’tzot Hashulchan (119:(4))</a> says that if one attaches something not to use there but just for it to remain until it is removed later, it is permitted. One can prove that connecting one object to another just to hold the former for later use elsewhere is not intrinsically forbidden, from the gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.50b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 50b</a>) that one may return firmly to a wall a knife that had been held there previously.</p>\n<p>Making or expanding a hole – It is forbidden to make or widen a hole in an object such as a barrel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.314.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, OC 314:1</a>). In playing darts, every successful throw makes a small hole in the board. However, the prohibition is when the hole is the type that is or could be useful (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.314.1?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.314.8&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura</a> ad loc. 8). In this case, though, the holes are incidental and unhelpful.</p>\n<p>Destroying – Holes created hasten making the board usable. Destroying utensils except flimsy ones to remove their contents on Shabbat is forbidden Rabbinically (Shulchan Aruch ibid. and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.314.1?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.314.7&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura</a> ad loc. 7). Yet, piercing a cork with a cork screw is permitted (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.314.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 314:17</a>; Shemirat Shabbat K’hilchata 9:20). The cork’s hole is neither a problem of being constructive or destructive and, practically, each hole the dart makes in the board is even less significant. Forbidding it because continuous dart throwing will eventually wear out the board is like forbidding walking in shoes because they will eventually get worn out. We also find that it is permitted to make a hole in a piece of paper (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.323.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 323:20</a>), with the possible exception of when the hole is made in a place that communicates information (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.323.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 323:5</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>In all, you can play darts; you might want, as a chumra, to avoid storing the darts on the board.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When did Avraham Avinu become Jewish\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Avraham Avinu is often called \"the first Jew\".</p>\n\n<p>When did he become Jewish. Was it when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>He recognized G-d?</p></li>\n<li><p>G-d spoke to him for the first time?</p></li>\n<li><p>Covenant Between The Parts?</p></li>\n<li><p>When G-d changed his name?</p></li>\n<li><p>When he had a circumcision?</p></li>\n<li><p>When Yitzchok was born?</p></li>\n<li><p>When he passed the 10th and final test?</p></li>\n<li><p>Some other event in his life?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or perhaps he was never Jewish and we just mean that he was the first in what would eventually become the Jewish nation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>\"Jewish,\" as @Yishai points out in the comments, is an anachronism. I don't think we're talking about being what we'd call Jewish nowadays - being a member of the Jewish Nation. It's pretty irrelevant to ask whether you'd marry off your daughter to Avraham Avinu or whether you'd count him for a minyan, since neither your daughter nor the other nine guys could have co-existed with him.</p>\n\n<p>I think the sense in which we call him the \"first Jew\" is that he entered into a covenant with God that would designate his descendants as the \"Chosen People\" (whatever that means). The first place we have this in the Torah is at the Covenant between the Parts (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8210\">Gen. 15</a>). Therein, God foretells what would be the forging process of the Jewish Nation through exile and redemption and promises that the conclusion wold be the Jews' acquisition of the Land of then-Canaan. I think it's fair to say that at that point, then-Avram was designated as the progenitor of the \"Chosen People.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Perhaps it was when he rejected idolatry. Hhaza\"l explains (exact source I don't know immediately) the reason Mordekhai was called a Jew, Yahudhi, although he belonged to the tribe of Binyomin, is because all who reject idolatry are called Jews, Yahudhim, (as if there is a broader and a more exact definition for the term). This is based in the fact that the name Yahudho derives from the 4 letter Name of HaShem, י and ה followed by ו and ה, combined with the phrase הודיה (thanks/praise) and/or any of its variants; thus the name means roughly \"one who praises/thanks HaShem\", as opposed to idols.</p>\n\n<p>As to why all of the people of Israel are referred to as \"Jews\" can certainly be explained in this way, and also that the tribe of Yahudho was the primary surviving tribe during the Babylonian exile, after many of the northern tribes of Israel were majorly exiled by Assyria beforehand. Albeit, amounts of all tribes do exist within the Jewish people today. And in the future, Moshiahh will be able to say who is who.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This article from Chabad.org, <em><a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2014920/jewish/Was-Abraham-Jewish.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Was Abraham Jewish? On the Identity of the Pre-Sinai Hebrews</a></em>, pretty thoroughly discusses this topic.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how to elaborate on it without rewriting the whole article, but after discussing the different times Avraham was chosen by G-d and the Covenants made between G-d and Avraham, one paragraph says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accordingly, when we refer to Abraham as the first Jew or convert, it does not mean that he was actually Jewish in the sense that we know today—in the sense of a binding obligation. Rather, he had the technical status of a Noahide, just as any other person of the time (albeit one that was given additional unique commandments such as circumcision, in which he was indeed obligated). It was not until his descendants stood at Mount Sinai and G‑d proclaimed, “You shall be to Me a treasure out of all peoples . . . and you shall be to Me a kingdom of princes and a holy nation,” that we became the Jewish People.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Please read the article for context.</p>\n\n\n",

But some have the custom to say <em>birkas hamazon</em> and <em>sheva b'rachos</em> on two cups as usual but not to say the <em>b'racha</em> \"<em>hagafen</em>\" on either cup, and to leave the cups until after <em>maariv</em> and then to say <em>havdala</em> on the <em>birkas hamazon</em> cup, and then to taste from the <em>sheva b'rachos</em> cup as usual, namely that they mix the two cups and give it to the bridegroom, bride, and all those present.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He notes in footnote 65 that Rabbi <em>Moshe</em> Feinstein is quoted by Rabbi <em>Efrayim</em> Greenblatt as having said that the bride and bridegroom should drink from the cups but no one else.

I don't recall whether that was his advice or something he had seen or what: I merely recall his mentioning the idea. It would seem to fit in with the discussion above: according to <em>Rav Moshe</em>, apparently, the leader of <em>birkas hamazon</em> shouldn't drink unless he's the bridegroom, whereas according to some others the leader can drink anyway, so this removes some doubt as to what to do.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Regarding drinking the wine after reciting Birkat HaMazon over a cup of wine at Seudah Shelishit if it’s already past sunset, some Ashkenazim are stringent not to.

I was wondering if all Kosher wines are valid, of if there is really something to it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>I'm marking this as community wiki, so anyone who has more information (and/or sources) please add it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some things to think about when choosing a wine for kiddush:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You must be able to say Borei Pri Hagafen on the wine (so it has to be made out of grapes). Manishewitz for example, makes some <a href=\"http://www.manischewitzwine.com/products/products.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">cherry wine</a>, which is Shehakol (and says so on the bottle) and unfit for Kiddush.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are some wines/grape juices that are mixed with water. This would not be valid for kiddush. The question here is if you add water to the wine, when do you say sheacol? There's a difference of opinion of maran and rama. It is well known that for many years the eda haharedit would give hechsher to wine/juice that has enough water in the mixture to be considered water for sefaradim. The Rav Ovadia would say that it is not only not casher for kidush but we say sheacol to drink. Because of this, today many wineries print that their wine/juice is also casher for havdala and kidush as the opinion of the maran habet iosef.</p></li>\n<li><p>The wine should not be pagum (disqualified?) (See fn. 6 <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-Winter09.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).  You can fix this wine by adding some more wine from the bottle (there are other ways to fix it as well, see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&pgnum=158\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 182:5-6</a>). - If you have no other alternative it is better to make Kiddush on pagum wine, than not to make Kiddush at all (OC 182:7).</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a discussion amongst Rabbinical Authorities whether wine that is Mevushal (cooked) may be used for Kiddush. The Rambam holds that wine must be fit to be offered on the altar in order to be good for Kiddush, and cooked wine may not be offered on the altar. As such, it may not be used for Kiddush. Others disagree. In practice maran in shulhan aruch mentions in three places than wine mevushal is casher (for kidush, avdala and 4 cups) (see <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/15-25_May_We_Use_Grape_Juice_for_the_Arba_Kosot_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a discussion among Rabbinical Authorities whether grape juice may be used for Kiddush. (see <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/15-25_May_We_Use_Grape_Juice_for_the_Arba_Kosot_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). And there is disagreement amongst modern Halachic Authorities whether reconstituted grape juice may be used for Kiddush. (see <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/15-26_May_We_Use_Grape_Juice_for_the_Arba_Kosot_2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My understanding is that when it says \"Kosher for Kiddush\" on the bottle, it is just letting you know that it is at least mostly grape product (if not %100 grape) and nothing more. It should also say Mevushal or non-Mevushal on the bottle.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Any kosher wine (or grape juice) can be used for kiddush.  During Pesach make sure it is kosher for Pesach (usually the case, but check).</p>\n\n<p>Some hold that you can use drinks other than wine if you cannot have grape products.  There doesn't appear to be consensus on this, so consult a rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>I have been taught that if wine or grape juice is not available, one can make kiddush on bread.  (Of course, you have to change bracha, as with other substitutions.)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I'm leaving this here because of the attached comments, but the community wiki <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8670/what-makes-a-wine-valid-for-kiddush/8673#8673\">answer</a> (which wasn't yet here when I posted) is much better.  Go there. :-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Just adding to the already well rounded replies. I'm currently studying Shulchan Aruch. Siman 77 s3 tells us that it is ideal to recite Kiddush over older wine; it is ideal to choose a wine of superior quality. It then goes on to talk about red vs white, etc. alluding to the fact that there are specific wine(s) for this purpose only, indicating that Kiddush wine is (among other markings) \"older\" and \"superior quality\" than other kosher wines.</p>\n\n\n",

The first is to teach us sensitivity (interpretation of the Yerushalmi,  alt. the cover makes the challah as if it isn't there).  Per the pasuk on which our sages based the order of saying brachos, bread should have precedence over wine.  Although we may not eat the bread until after kiddush, we practice sensitivity and cover the bread so that the bread, so to speak, won't experience the moment.  Accordingly, after the bracha of hagafen, the cover can be removed. (Magen Avraham <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14325&st=&pgnum=54\" rel=\"nofollow\">271:20</a>)  </p>\n\n<p>The second reason is to recall the manna (which fell double on erev shabbos- hence the 2 loaves) which was covered above and below with a protective dew.  Accordingly, the cover above and below should be kept until after hamotzi.  Although the Mishna Berurah <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=94\" rel=\"nofollow\">271:41</a> says that the Pri Megadim implies that even according to reason 2 you can take the cover off after kiddush, with the Chayei Adam preferring it remain covered.  </p>\n\n<p>A third reason applies even if you are in the middle of a seudah where the bread is covered during kiddush and then removed to show that the seudah moving forward is to honor shabbos.  Here also you can take it off after kiddush.  (Magen Avraham <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14325&st=&pgnum=54\" rel=\"nofollow\">271:20</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>The Shulchan Aruch says to cut the bottom Challah on Friday night.  How do we pass up the mitzvah of cutting the top challah?</p>\n\n<p>As you alluded to in your question there are a number of options if you choose to \"pass up the mitzva\" of the Shulchan Aruch and go for another option which includes cutting the bottom and not passing over the mitzva.  One option is to switch the challos after Vayechulu of kiddush (top to bottom).  Another is to cut both challos.  Another is to hold the bottom one closer.  The third is what I have seen the most.  There doesn't seem to be a specific rule for how to hold it. All of these options are just seeking practical solutions to being caught between halachik preferences (See the language of the nos'ei keilim <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14325&st=&pgnum=61\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 275</a>). The same goes for moving the 2nd challah away if you are not cutting it like option 2- whatever works for you practically.</p></li>\n<li><p>As for holding the challos- both challos are included in the bracha.  So, you should hold both with your 10 fingers on both and customarily raise both at Hashem's name.  (M.B <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=120\" rel=\"nofollow\">167:23</a>)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

I've been to some shuls where this is done every Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>A related practice is \"pledge drives\", where after the Rabbi's speech on a major holiday, the floor is open for people to pledge donations to the shul.</p>\n\n<p>How is this allowed on Shabbat and holidays?

Further on (:33) he adds that there is a dispute whether it is permitted to \"sell\" mitzvos on Shabbos, with some authorities forbidding it and others saying it's fine because no actual object is being bought, \"so in places where they are customarily lenient on this, one should not object against them.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>When I was stumbled by this practice and addressed this question to a Rabbi in Ba'abad shul in Jerusalem, he reminded me of the Halachah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.85b.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 85a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חלל עליו שבת אחת כדי שישמור שבתות הרבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought he was joking at first, but he explained seriously that if it is Halachicly allowed to override Deorayso prohibition to save a single life, it would be allowed to override some Rabbinical prohibitions on Shabbos in order to revive a whole congregation/community.</p>\n\n<p>He added a famous Haredi joke that although the world rests on three pillars Torah, G-d worshipping and Tzedakkah, Money is what makes it spin.

(Of. Malnak V. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, U.S.D.C. of N.J. 76-341, esp. pp. 36-50, 78)</p>\n<p><em>On the other hand, certain aspects of the said movements, which are entirely irrelevant to religious worship or practices, have a therapeutic value, particularly in the area of relieving mental stress.</em></p>\n<p>It follows that if these therapeutic methods – insofar as they are utterly devoid of any ritual implications – would be adopted by doctors specializing in the field of mental illness, it would have two-pronged salutary effect: Firstly, in the view of the fact that these methods are therapeutically effective, while there are, regretfully, many who could benefit from such treatment, this is a matter of healing of the highest order, since it has to do with mental illness. It would, therefore, be very wrong to deny such treatment to those who need it, when it could be given by a practicing doctor.</p>\n<p>Secondly, and this too is not less important, since there are many Jewish sufferers who continue to avail themselves of these methods though the said cults despite the Rabbinic prohibition, it can be assumed with certainty that many of them, if not all, who are drawn to these cults by the promise of mental relief, would prefer to receive the same treatment from the medical profession – if they had a choice of getting it the kosher way. It would thus be possible to save many Jews from getting involved with the said cults.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And <a href=\"http://www.mpaths.com/2013/08/the-lubavitcher-rebbe-on-yoga.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">another letter</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inasmuch as the Torah and mitzvot were given to all the Jews, and to each one individually, for all times and in all places, and “these are our lives and the length of our days,” it is clear that every moment of a Jew's life should be consecrated to Torah and mitzvot. Hence it is both surprising and painful to see a Jew spending precious time in search of \"greener pastures\" elsewhere, even if his intentions are good, for, as above, the important thing is the actual deed.</p>\n<p><strong>Needless to say, the above includes Yoga and similar cults even if it is not connected with anything pertaining to avodo zoro (idol worship) - if there is such cult that is completely free from avodo zoro, and in this only a competent Torah authority who is permeated with halocho is qualified to rule.</strong></p>\n<p>I am not seeking opportunities to admonish anyone, but since you mention certain oriental cults, it is my duty to call your attention to the fact that every spare moment that a Jew can use to deepen his  knowledge of Torah he dissipates it on other things is deplorable enough, not to mention cults that in their overwhelming majority are certainly connected with avodo zoro in one way or another, and if there are exceptions, one must make doubly sure through an expert  Torah authority, as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>The present days are highly suitable for Jews to separate themselves from any alien influences  in preparation for the Festival of Mattan Toraseinu (the giving of our Torah), when G-d sanctified us as a nation apart from all other nations, a unique \"Kingdom of G-d's servants and a Holy Nation,\" by giving us His holy Torah and mitzvos. And since G-d Himself has shown us the way, what sense is there in looking for better ways. This is really too plain and self-evident to need further elaboration.</p>\n<p>Wishing you a Joyous and inspiring Festival of Kabbolas haTorah and the traditional blessing to reaffirm the commitment to Torah and mitzvot with joy and inwardness.</p>\n<pre><code>                With blessing,\n                The Rebbe’s Signature\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Wearing Watches on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is a watch one can wear on shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>There are the analogue quartz watches with just one crown to adjust the time that (as far as I'm aware) most people would wear on shabbat (especially an expensive one since it's more like jewellery.)</p>\n\n<p>Then there are the digital watches with various trinkets such as alarms, calculators and universal television remotes.</p>\n\n<p>You can also get watches that record audio and video, watches that are phones and more futuristic, computers in their own right.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what is the extent of watches that one can wear on shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>CYLOR</p>\n\n<p>The issue would seem to be one of <em>muktza</em> - objects that may not be moved during <em>shabas</em> because they are not for <em>shabas</em> use. Let us assume that a standard watch is not <em>muktza</em> because it is a <em>k'li shem'lachto l'heter</em> - its normal usage is permitted on <em>shabas</em>. (See the last line of the long paragraph on <a href=\"http://www.toraschaimdallas.org/wp-content/files/Muktza.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this convenient Google hit</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>The complex devices to which you refer have this functionality as well as some other functionality. If the additional functionality were to prohibit the otherwise permissible watch, it must be because we assess those functions separately, as if it were a hybrid between a watch and [for example] a remote control. The latter would be a <em>k'li shem'lachto l'isur</em> - a tool whose normal usage is prohibited on <em>shabas</em>, which is consequently immovable barring special circumstances. If so, we have a case of one <em>muktza</em> object inextricably attached to one non-<em>muktza</em> object, which is addressed by Ramba\"m in his <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hilchos Shabas</em> 25:14</a>,15. He says that moving the assemblage for the permissible item is permitted while moving it for the prohibited item is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The above makes the assumption that anything strapped to the wrist that has a clock face is defined as a watch regardless of its other accessories.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit in light of @SethJ:</strong> The other exceptional case you mentioned - an especially elegant watch that is considered jewelry - would generally not present a <em>muktza</em> problem on its own, but one could arise if it were so prized that one kept it around just for its value and not to wear. That category is \"<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">concern for <em>chisaron kis</em> - monetary loss</a>\". One's objects of business - like inventory for sale, and decorative artwork can be <em>muktzim</em> as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In addition to what my predecessors wrote, today's smartwatches include two functions that must be disabled before Shabbat:</p>\n\n<p>a. Communication: e.g. Bluetooth, WiFi, etc. If the smartwatch has \"Airplane Mode\", then you must turn it on. I don't think that turning off the \"Bluetooth\" will be enough, because there are more functions that should be disabled, but make a \"She'elat-Hacham\".</p>\n\n<p>b. Touch: It's Psik-Reisha, and must be turned off. In some smartwatches (e.g. Pebble), there is no Touch, thanks G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not a Posek...  ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Edit on Dec. 7: After buying this watch (the \"Time\" model), I must comment that there is one more problematic sensor in Pebble: the Motion sensor.\nIn order to wear it in Shabbat, one must disable this sensor, and I'm not sure it's possible.\nI'll investigate it, bli-neder, when I have time...  ;-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would think to say from <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/Display.asp?ClipDate=3/31/2011\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> daily Halacha that any watch that simply has the date/time is fine, but when you start to get involved with those \"tv watches\" there probably would be a problem because the watch is only a \"tafel\" to the tv.

This is a halachic wrapping for words of Torah, tefillin, siddurim, sifrei Torah, etc. being brought into a situation of uncleanliness like a bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>The halachot are as follows (this is all based on learning from my Rabbi, so I don't have sources for you, sorry...):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You must have 2 separate coverings aside from the items usual covering (ie. a tefillin bag)\n<ul>\n<li>An exception to this rule is while traveling, where you may rely on a single covering in addition to the item's usual covering (tefilling in tefillin bag in backpack)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>One of the coverings may be clear, but one of them must opaque to the point which one cannot make out the text written underneath it.\n<ul>\n<li>For example in the Yeshiva where I learned the Mezuzot are all in clear plastic cases, but the ones which are in eye-shot of the bathroom are also wrapped in printer paper so as to prevent them from 'seeing' the bathroom.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>There is no distinction as far as porous vs. non-porous for this matter.

Regarding these items they should be double wrapped if using a porous material (such as paper or a napkin) and may be single wrapped if using a non-porous material (ie. a plastic bag). (Again this is learned directly from my Rabbi, so sorry for the lack of sources...)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the answer to your question depends on the context and requirements.</p>\n\n<p>For cooking for example, it can't be porous, for tumah, it can, but it has to be a Kli.  For a mezuzah it can be transparent, but has to be weatherproof, for Challah it can't, as it has to be hidden. For \"coverings\" like the shemah or tachanun all you need is something physical of any nature that isn't your body.  But you asked about a wrapping, not a covering.</p>\n\n<p>Sof'b'sof, I imagine that a halachic wrapping is anything which fulfills the requirements of the wrapping.  That is, if the purpose of the wrapping is to prevent sight, then it just has to be opaque without giving a hint as to what is behind it. If the purpose of the wrapping is to keep it clean, then it must prevent dirt, (such as saran wrap).  However, I defer to any brisker types out there, who might have a particular hebrew or aramaic word for wrapping and what it is defined by, and which mitzvot it applies to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.40.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MB in 40:7</a> explains why one cover at least, must be opaque. He says that there needs to be 2 covers, AND, it must not be able to be seen. Therefore, a glass of clear plastic would be good for one cover, but you can’t use it for both, since it would be able to be seen through them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם על המזוזה יש כסוי זכוכית אף שהמזוזה נראית מתוכה אפ\"ה נחשבת כסוי אחד ודי בפריסת סודר על המזוזה דהא עתה לא מיתחזיא וכ\"כ הדה\"ח. אבל לכו\"ע לא מהני אם יכסנה עוד בזכוכית מלמעלה אע\"ג שמכוסה בשני כסויין דהא המזוזה נראית מתוכן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.240.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MB IN 240:25</a> he explains that a porus Mechitza is a machlokes, but in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=60387&st=&pgnum=309\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar Hatzion 240:12</a> he seems to indicate that the reason is due to the fact that it only separates the room and makes it as a different place. However, the issue of covering is not accomplished. So in a case where only a Mechitza is required, it would be fine, but for a covering, it’s unacceptable -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב המ\"א אם יש נקבים וחלונות במחיצה כעין סריגה אסור עד שיהיו הספרים מכוסים מן העין שאין נראין ובספר נהר שלום מפקפק על דבריו וכן בספר תוספת ירושלים ובמקום הדחק יש לסמוך ע\"ז אכן לכתחלה טוב לכסות שלא יהיו הספרים נראי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Do we not first rush into Shabbos and then delay its departure? Then why do we sing it in the opposite order?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I once heard an answer as follows: The Torah was given on Shabbos, so the first extension of Shabbos was the מאחרים לצאת they did that evening. It was only the following week that they fulfilled ממהרים לבא.</p>\n\n<p>A similar answer is that at the time the song is being sung, it is already Shabbos, so the next event that will occur is מאחרים לצאת, not ממהרים לבא.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is that one may have ulterior motives for beginning Shabbos early (e.g., he is tired, hungry, had a long week, etc.). But to extend the ending of Shabbos truly shows one's respect of the day. Thus, we first say מאחרים לצאת to prove that yidden truly value Shabbos, and then the ממהרים לבא is understood to be for Shabbos' sake, rather than for one's own benefit.</p>\n\n<p>[However, let me also point out the obvious: לבא rhymes with אוהבו and the other words at the end of those stanzas; לצאת would mess up the poetry.

I've looked at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5197/learning-hebrew\">this</a> question but I don't think I'd say I have \"decent Hebrew knowledge\" quite yet.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I think that a gap between aleph-beis and reading tanakh is big enough.</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest you to read children books - they are fully punctuated and use pretty simple words.</p>\n\n<p>When I was learning hebrew (my parents made aliyah when I was 13 years old) I was watching cartoons for 5 years old children and that helped me pretty much.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't know if this is good for self-teaching, but what about the <a href=\"http://shop.alephchamp.com/categories/Home-Kits/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alep Champ home kit</a>?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm not fluent (yet), but after failing to find suitable classes I worked my way through <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0939144158\" rel=\"nofollow\">The First Hebrew Primer</a> from EKS and that helped quite a bit.

He replied. 'He who reads the letter, let him be the agent [to carry out its instructions]'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960660/jewish/Chapter-Twelve.htm#footnoteRef8a960660\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Issurei Biah 12:4</a>), the laws of \"He who cohabits with a heathen woman is punished by zealots\" is Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai (Sinaitic Law), and support for this can be derived from Pinchas' slaying of Zimri. <sub><sup><em>(I interpret this to mean that we learn the particulars of the Sinaitic Law from the story of Pinchas [e.g. this law only applies if it is committed in public]. I could be wrong.)</em></sup></sub>  </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960660/jewish/Chapter-Twelve.htm#footnoteRef11a960660\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halacha 5</a>, the Rambam says that \"<em>If the zealous person comes to ask permission from the court to slay him, they do not instruct him [to], even if this takes place at the time [of relations].</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21531&st=&pgnum=229\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chidushei HaRim says</a> (English translation <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15499&pgnum=195\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) that the reason for this is a zealot is someone who reacts to a situation instantly and takes immediate action. Pausing to ask Beit Din what to do shows that he is not a true zealot. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Why wasn't Pinchas asking Moshe \"<em>'O great-uncle! did you not teach us this on thy descent from Mount Sinai: He who cohabits with a heathen woman is punished by zealots?'</em>\" considered asking Beit Din what to do? Doesn't Pinchas stopping to ask Moshe about the law take him out of the catagory of zealot?</p>\n\n<p>Also, if the Beit Din does not tell someone to go and kill the sinner, why does Moshe tell Pinchas \"<em>He who reads the letter, let him be the agent [to carry out its instructions]</em>\"? Wasn't that Beit Din ruling that Pinchas should kill Zimri?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Is Pinchas asking Moshe for a ruling, or deferring to his teacher and giving Moshe the chance to act before he does?</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14458&pgnum=152\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chidushei HaRan in Sanhedrin</a> gives two answers (I hope I'm translating correctly):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Pinchas wasn't asking what the law was, and Moshe wasn't answering him. Moshe said \"let he who read the letter be the agent\". He was saying that I'm not telling you the halacha, but if zealotry is required here, you're the best man for the job.</p></li>\n<li><p>Moshe Rabbeinu was not trying to put the matter in the hands of zealots. Rather, he was hinting to Pinchas on a one time basis (Ho'ra'at Sha'ah) what needed to be done to end the plague.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Just to further flesh this out with some thoughts I had, inspired in part by various answers given to this question:</p>\n\n<p>Q: Wasn't Pinchas asking \"didn't you teach us...\" make him not a zealot?</p>\n\n<p>A: The Gemara relates that when Zimri came and challenged Moshe, saying \"is this Midyanite woman permitted to me, and if you say no, how could you marry a Midyanite woman?\", Moshe forgot the Halacha. The correct protocol when correcting a <a href=\"http://www.yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur143.html#10\" rel=\"nofollow\">father</a> or <a href=\"http://www.yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur144.html#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">teacher</a>, one should not say \"You're wrong\". Instead, they should say \"Didn't we learn such and such?\". </p>\n\n<p>Since Pinchas saw that Moshe had forgotted the Halacha (and apparently Pinchas himself had forgotten it until right then, as the Gemara says \"He saw what happened and remembered the Halacha\"), we could say that he wasn't asking what the Halacha was, he was reminding Moshe what the Halacha was in a respectful and halachically correct manner. Perhaps this is why Rashi (Bamidbar 25:7) does not phrase what Pinchas said to Moshe as a question.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can then say this is what the Chidushei HaRim is saying. If someone comes to Beit Din to <em>ask permission</em> to kill the sinner, this shows he is not a true zealot. But <em>reminding</em> someone of the halacha does not make him not-a-zealot. (However, this still leaves us with the Chidushei HaRim apparently contradicting himself, since right before that he seems to emphasize that Pinchas was asking Moshe whether he should do it or not.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, perhaps we can differentiate between asking Beit Din for confirmation that he learned the halacha correctly (which Pinchas did), and asking Beit Din if he has permission to carry out the halacha (which the Rambam says Beit Din does not give him).</p>\n\n<p>And by answering back, \"He who reads the letter, let him be the agent [to carry out its instructions]\", Moshe wasn't directly answering the question, since the Halacha is \"Ain Morin Lo\" (as the Ran said).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=73&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 73a</a> there are number of cases when a sinner could be killed by a single person but not by the beis din (also known as 'din rodef'). Rashi says there:\n<code>ואלו שמצילין אותן. מן העבירה</code>, that means that saving a sinner from making a sin is enough reason to kill him even without a victim.</p>\n\n\n",

This is mentioned in the Tur Orach Chaim at the end of siman 61. Previously, in siman 24, he mentioned a Bal Haitur that explained the practice of people to gather together the strings and put them on their eyes, and rationalized, perhaps they do this because of וראיתם אותו and their tzitzis were worn under their clothes. </p>\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef explains all of this in the light that this practice was originally met with much opposition. The Avudraham quoted Rav Natrunai Gaon said it is haughty to do anything publicly which one is not required to do. The Beis Yosef adds now that there are a small amount of purple that do it, it is no longer haughty. </p>\n\n<p>But the B.Y. goes on to quote the Orchos Chaim who brings Rav Natrunai Gaon, but also brought Rav Moshe Gaon who said the same and explained even further once someone thought about his tzitzis while pouring them on, why would he hold them in his hands afterwards? And according to this, he should hold his tephilin when he mentions them. And if you think he should do this, then when he mentions mezuzah he should go put his hand on that, therefore it is improper. He ends off quoting the Eshkol to look at the tzitzis which the B.Y. takes as meaning he agrees with. The B.Y. points to aforementioned Tur in siman 61 which seems to rule accordingly. And also different between tzitzis and mezuzah by explain tzitzis are right there next to you. The B.Y. goes on to quote many Rishonim who say simply looking at tzitzis is a mitzvah in it's own right which would give credence towards taking care to look at them when mentioning them in Krias Shma.</p>\n\n<p>With all of this we understand the words in the Shulchan Aruch that SOME look at the tzitzis and touch then to their eyes and its good to do and all for the love of the mitzvah. The Ramma adds that some people also kiss the tzitzis for this same reason. The parenthesis erroneously attribute this idea as a quote from the B.Y. It is not. The Ramma wrote in the Darkei Moshe that he has seen people doing this and explained that it is also because of love for the mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>One more point, as of yet no one has mentioned a multiple kissing process when saying the word tzitzis. From the Ramma and Darkei Moshe it is clear that a single instance of kissing them occurred when reaching the words וראיתם אותו.\nHowever the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch mentions a practice to kiss them with every mention of the word. The Kaf Hachaim also brings from <em>Chesed L'Avraham</em> who mentions this practice as well.</p>\n\n\n",

The two statements seem almost contradictory as the latter suggests removing all doubts by learning the laws and the former instructs what to do assuming a doubt has arisen.</p>\n<p>Which is the <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> recommending to do first in a case of serious existential doubt - recite <em>shehakol</em> or consult someone knowledgeable?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*Liberties taken with this translation include: transliterating rather than translating the \"<em>b'rachos</em>\"; translating חכם as rabbi because I assume both are being used colloquially rather than strictly; indiscriminate switching between \"one\" and \"he\" for the arbitrary pronoun.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Well, the latter statement is someone who not has learned the laws.  The former is someone who has learned, and knows the structure of the laws, but there are still many difficult applications which even a scholar is unsure of.  This is indicated by the wording in the former statement which does not state \"if he is unsure about the law\", but \"if he is unsure if it is the main (part) of the produce\".  </p>\n\n<p>An example of this is the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14326&st=&pgnum=298\" rel=\"nofollow\">2nd halacha in Shulchan Aruch 202</a>. Grapes have a different rule about when they become haetz than other fruits.  Once the fruits appear and are minimally edible, they are haetz.  Grapes need to be a certain size- as big as a \"white bean\"(?).  But since we practically don't know what size of bean (the larger or smaller variety), we make a ha'adama until we are sure.</p>\n\n\n",

It is the prophet who is supposed to be the light unto nations. He claims this original usage was changed by the early Zionists for political reasons.

By starting a car, I'd think I would be starting a fire. Is a Jew allowed to do this? Why or why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=35\">Moses tells the people</a> who are about to get busy building the Tabernacle (sort of a travelling Temple in the desert) that they need to pause all their construction activities on the Sabbath, and mentions for instance not to burn things.</p>\n\n<p>Our Oral Tradition (recorded in the Talmud, tractate <em>Shabbat</em>, see especially Chapter 7) has a list of 39 categories of creative labor which were used in building the Tabernacle, all of which are therefore prohibited on the Sabbath: \"growing\" (including planting, watering, and fertilizing), \"plowing\", \"reaping\", \"cooking or baking\", \"dyeing\", and so on and so forth. One of these is, as stated, \"burning.\" </p>\n\n<p>Hence, use of the internal combustion engine is prohibited on Sabbath.

This is not <em>exactly</em> correct.  One may hear people say that \"in the old days\" it was a lot of work to make a fire (and thus light) but now all we have to do is flip a switch, so now it is not work and is ok to do.  This incorrect thinking is applied to many of the other Sabbath prohibitions.\nThe fact is that the the type of 'work' that is prohibited, as someone stated above, is based on the 39 categories of creative activities that were done in the construction of the 'Mishkan', i.e. the Tabernacle (portable 'Temple') that was constucted when the Jews were in the desert after the exodus from Egypt. Those construction activities were halted for the Sabbath.  The whole basis of 'resting' on the Sabbath is because G-d 'rested' on the 7th day after the 6 days of creation.\nNow we know that after those 6 days of creation G-d did NOT say \"Wow, I am exhausted! I need to rest!\"  What that 'rest' means is that He stopped doing creative activity.  In like manner he commanded the Jewish people to cease from doing creative activities on the Sabbath.  This serves as reminder every week as to WHO it is that created the world we live in and who is truly in control of it.  It gives a chance to reflect about the greatness of G-d and all He has given us, and about the limited creative powers that we do have because HE gave us those abilities to use to serve HIM.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there anything written to explain why He would not have stopped it? or why He would have allowed it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 36)\n\n<p>This is a very broad and deep topic; the whole book of Job struggles with bad things happening to good people. After a lot of talk (and Job's friends trying to be helpful by saying \"oh Job, obviously it's punishment for some sin you did, silly boy\", and both Job and G-d telling them to go jump in a lake), the conclusion appears to be that it's beyond human understanding. But faced with the brilliance of G-d, the questions disappear.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Joseph Soloveichik</strong> referred to questions about the Holocaust as \"an exercise in futility.\" <strong>Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn</strong> (the 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe) said that anyone believing in a merciful and omnipotent G-d is <em>obligated</em> to be challenged by what happened, yet we have no good answers.</p>\n<p>The simplest answer here is that G-d gave humans free will; if people can choose to do good or evil, that means they are able to do good or evil. Humans chose to do a great deal of evil 1939-1945. Still we're left with asking when G-d interferes with human plans and when not, which is again beyond our comprehension. We do have the notion that once it was decided that an entire community will perish, that applies \"wholesale\"; even a few good people within it may not be saved, barring exceptional merit or Divine purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein</strong> escaped Europe in 1937 and became the rabbinic backbone of post-Holocaust American Orthodoxy; he viewed his escape from the Holocaust as a sign of his calling to serve the people. People would ask why he wasted so much of his time answering all sorts of questions from all sorts of people; he replied \"the rabbis who took themselves seriously aren't around anymore.\" But that explains one person, not the group effect.</p>\n<p>To claim it's a punishment for sin is quite complicated, put mildly, and immediately leads to finger-pointing. Some have claimed it was the sin of Zionism; others, the sin of opposing Zionism. As Job told his \"friends\", let's not go there.</p>\n<p>I've heard survivors say they have no questions, it was massive punishment just as the Bible says may happen. I've heard non-survivors say it can't be explained. We may not have better answers than that.</p>\n<p>A helpful thought I heard on the subject from <strong>Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein</strong> is from Maharal; that sometimes G-d lets great evil grow quite large, to show it can still be defeated.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, we move forward.</p>\n<p>(Much of this is summarized from a talk on the subject from Rabbi Adlerstein I heard several years ago, as well as an mp3 from <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YuTorah.org</a> by <strong>Rabbi Shnayer Leiman</strong> on theodicy.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshech Chochmah</a></strong> (1843–1926), writing decades before the Holocaust, describes the pattern of Jewish History. He explains how the Jews first arrive at a place and focus on Torah and mitzvos, but then later generations become comfortable, and begin slacking off in observance and forgetting they're in exile. Eventually this reaches the point that they are exiled again.<br>\nHe predicts that a similar pattern will happen in Germany, for \"they say Berlin is Jerusalem\", and abandoned the Mitzvos. \nThe actual 'exile' that happened was far worse than the previous exiles in history, but there it had also been a much greater change in society. Though no one in this world can fully understand how God runs the world or why bad things happen to good people. </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Meshech Chochmah</strong> can be found <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/mhochma/mhochma15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (p. 244-245) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Sorry for saying that:</p>\n<p><strong>G-d doesn't stop what He started</strong><sup>1,2</sup>.

Why couldn't Jesus be the Messiah spoken of? Or could he possibly have been?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 102)\n\n<p>I used to be a Christian but converted to Orthodox Judaism more than 32 years ago.  I have a website called:  \"<a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/md3/baruchgershom/ynotj.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Primer: Why Jews Can't Believe in Jesus</a>\" that should more than adequately answer your question (although I actually designed it for Jewish education and not to combat missionaries).  But let me just touch on the basics:</p>\n\n<p>Not only isn't Jesus the Messiah, but it is obviously so that the Messiah has yet to come, although, G-d willing he will come soon.  We know this definitively because we do not live in the Messianic Age.  If we lived in the Messianic Age you would know it because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All Jews would be living in Israel (Isa. 11:12, 27:12-13); </li>\n<li>Israel would also be populated by the resurrected souls who died in previous generations (Isa. 26:19);</li>\n<li>The Holy Temple would be rebuilt and functioning (Micah 4:1); </li>\n<li>There would be world-wide peace (Isa. 2:4, 11:6, Micah 4:3); and, </li>\n<li>The entire world would believe in the G-d of Abraham (Isa. 11:9, 40:5; Zephaniah 3:9). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have read the papers recently, you would know that none of these things has yet occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Now, many missionaries tell me that Jesus will rise from the dead and do all the requisite things that Messiahs are supposed to do that he didn't get to.  In golf, they call that a \"mulligan\" -- a do-over.  There have been a lot of people who claimed to be, or were acclaimed to be  the Messiah over the last 2000 years or so.  If you give one guy a mulligan, they all have to get mulligans.  So where are you now.  You cannot say that Jesus gets exclusivity to the mulligan because he is the Messiah, because that is just circular.</p>\n\n<p>You can tell me how Jesus raised the dead. Well, so did some of the rabbis who were almost his contemporaries, if you choose to believe in the Talmud's stories of the rabbis.  My friends here cited some examples in response to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23428/what-sages-were-known-to-have-revived-the-dead\">this question</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>You might tell me that Jesus suffered.  He did?  How long?  Was it more than a half a day that he was crucified?  Have you ever heard how ten of our sainted rabbis died at the hands of the Romans?  See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/\">this</a>.  And do you know anything about people like the Klausenburg Rebbe (Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam (1905-1994)), zt'l, who were imprisoned by the Nazis.  The Klausenburg lost his wife and 10 children who were killed in the death camps.  For more than a year he was personally starved, beaten and tortured by the Nazis, and yet kept the commandments in the camps, even though no one had to under the circumstances.  He even saved any rolls he received until the Sabbath eve when he would say the blessing over two rolls in honor of the Sabbath, and give that bread to the other inmates.  When he was rescued at the end of the war, he weighed about 85 lbs.  But he was undeterred.  After the war, he went on to build schools for children and hospitals for the sick on three continents.  Please read Judah Lifschitz's translation of the <a href=\"http://www.targum.com/excerpts/klausenberg.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Klausenburg Rebbe's biography</a>.  You will see that although he had no claim to be the Messiah, he litterally fed the hungry, took care of little children and healed the sick, and over a far longer time than the Christian messiah.</p>\n\n<p>And, if you tell me that he is the \"suffering servant\" defined in Isaiah 53, please go back to your copy of Isaiah and see who he defines as \"the servant.\"  No, it's not in chapter 53, but there are at least four verses in Isaiah that define Israel as G-d's \"servant.\"  (Is 44:2, 44:21, 45:4, and 49:3). Origen, the 3rd century Christian scholar, in Contra Celsum, admitted that this was the Jewish understanding of Isaiah 53, that the entire Jewish nation was G-d's servant and that they indeed had suffered for centuries before (and to come). But I will admit that Jewish liturgy and thought also suggest that Isaiah 53 does refer to the Messiah, among many others.  The Messiah, like righteous people have in every generation, will accept upon himself suffering for the excessive sins of others that G-d chooses not to give to the sinner because then they might lose all faith in G-d.  This belief, described at Talmud Bavli, Brachot 5a, is an explanation of why we see good people suffering for no apparent reason.</p>\n\n<p>Please see my <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/md3/baruchgershom/ynotj.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Primer</a> for other points.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>For a complete treatment of the subject, see a work like <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1879016117\">this</a>.

The messianic expectations of the first century were reflective of this context, and the expectations included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The messiah will overthrow the Roman regime in Judaea.

The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.'<br>\n  -  Isaiah 9.6-7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of the above facts are relevant in their own way, but the most basic reason for rejecting the claim that Jesus was the messiah is simple:  </p>\n\n<h2>He died.</h2>\n\n<p>Not only that, he died in the most horrific and humiliating manner imaginable.  He was stripped naked, flogged in public, spat on, nailed to a cross, and mocked and ridiculed by jeering crowds.  It is difficult to imagine anything less messianic than this.  When the messiah comes, he will not be crucified.  He will rule the world.</p>\n\n\n",

They all relate, but convey very different messages.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, you are asking about \"sons of god\" (בני האלהים). Your reference to Tehillim (<em>psalms</em>), does not use that Hebrew term. So strictly speaking, there are only four references, not five. But the commentaries to Tehillim do associate the term בני אלים to one of the meanings relating to the usage in Genesis.</p>\n\n<p>In Genesis 6:2, the Targum Onkelos (<em>a classic commentator who translates the Hebrew to Aramaic</em>) translates this phrase as בני רברביא, which means the children of <em>legal scholars and judges</em> or the children of <em>princes</em> meaning the aristocracy. Taken in context, this helps to explain what is going on here. These individuals have sexual relations with <em>the daughters of HaAdam</em>. The Targum translates this as בנת אנשא which means literally the daughters of <em>enosh</em>. There are several different terms used to describe human beings. The term <em>enosh</em> means someone who has not perfected themselves either intellectually or emotionally. They are <em>unrefined</em> and simple people.</p>\n\n<p>And so, this text is describing how the children of the aristocrats and legal scholars were having sexual relations with these daughters of commoners.</p>\n\n<p>And this follows the explanations of other classical commentators Targum Yonaton, Ramban and Rabbeinu Bechaye who explain that these people were judges of the people and they took sexual <em>favors</em> by force in the cases dealing with the non-aristocrats. It was a kind of bribery and was an accepted practice in that society.</p>\n\n<p>This relates to a concept of what is commonly called <em>marrying down</em> or ניחות דרגה in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaye on Genesis 5:2 identifies these judges, the בני אלהים, as the descendants of Chava, Adam's wife and the <em>Nachash HaKadmoni</em> (<em>a term which means literally the Primordial Serpent, but in the context of Rabbeinu Bechaye seems to mean an actual person</em>).</p>\n\n<p>After Kayin murdered his brother Hevel (<em>Abel</em>), Adam and Chava divorced (<em>they parted company</em>) for 130 years. These children from Chava and the <em>Nachash HaKadmoni</em> had such names as Yechavi'el and Metusha'el which is a naming convention normally reserved to Heavenly Angels. Rabbeinu Bechaye also counts Chanoch ben Kayin (Chanoch, son of of Cain, Genesis 4:17) among them. But in context, the naming convention is used here to indicate that they were aristocrats.</p>\n\n<p>These aristocrats were those children outside of the family line from Seth שת, the third son of Adam and Chava (Genesis 4:25) who took the place of Hevel (הבל <em>Abel</em>, Genesis 4:2) who had been murdered by Kayin, his brother. Adam and Chava <em>remarried</em> after being apart for 130 years.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaye explains that this is the origin and meaning of the phrase <em>Foundation Stone</em> meaning אבן שתיה. The stone which serves as the foundation of the Temple in Jerusalem are the descendants of Seth.</p>\n\n<p>This is the Peshat meaning of this text according to the <em>Meforshim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely enough, this story from the Torah which included Chanoch ben Kayin also appears to be the source for the creation of the character, Superman. the Superman character is also blended with the Midrash <em>Sefer Chanoch</em> of Chanoch ben Yered (Genesis 5:18) </p>\n\n<p>This comic was created by two <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1049411/Superman-creator-dreamed-comic-hero-father-died-armed-raid-boy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Jews from Cleveland</a>, Ohio in 1933.</p>\n\n<p>The comic creators, Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster made their character come to Earth from the heavens with super powers to defend the innocent people of Earth from the powerful, evil ones. Superman's true name is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kal-El</a> and his father's name is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor-El\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jor-El</a>, names using the Angel naming convention like mentioned by Rabbeinu Bechaye. And Superman comes to Earth from the heavens and falls in love with a human female, Lois Lane. Superman's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, which was originally called the <em>Secret Citadel</em> is located in the desolate north surrounded by snow  which also parallels the details of the isolated tower that Chanoch would retreat to as found in Sefer Chanoch.</p>\n\n<p>There are midrashic explanations which talk about these <em>B'nai HaElohim</em> being actual Angels. But in those discussions it emphasizes that the meaning in the Midrash is to show that everything which takes place here on a physical plane also occurs on the spiritual plane.</p>\n\n<p>This parallel idea is also used in your citation from Tehillim 29:1. Rashi says <em>B'nai Elim</em> are the children of <em>princes</em>, meaning aristocrats. While Ibn Ezra says the term is referencing the stars, because that is the system which G-d has put in place for His influence to be made in the world generally.</p>\n\n<p>The citations from Job (Iyov) are about actual Angels. This is confirmed from the Targum to Job 1:6 and 2:1 which translates this as כתי מלאכיא, which means <em>types of Angels</em>. Metzudot Tzion says this same usage also applies to Job 38:7. He explains that they are called <em>B'nai HaElokim</em> because they are <em>close</em> to the <em>Shechina</em>, G-d's revealed presence like members of His household. In the first two posukim from Job, both the Targum and Ramban explain that this was describing <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> (New Year), the time when G-d judges the whole world. These were the two categories of Angels that come before the Creator, one to advocate and the other to prosecute. This second category includes the Satan (which means literally <em>Prosecutor</em> or <em>Accuser</em>). The Ramban emphasizes that based on this information it is clear that this all transpired via prophecy, meaning Heavenly inspired vision, not in a physical sense.</p>\n\n<p>So the term בני האלהים has multiple meanings and are dependent on context. It can be referring to children of aristocrats or children of judges or it can be referring to the family line from Chava other than the descendants of Seth, or it can be referring to actual Angels. To understand the correct meaning requires relying on the traditional teachings that have been preserved and passed down to the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n",

But that happens with all translations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I think your question is the word <em>Elohim</em> for G-d, which is used in the Bible to indicate authority -- sometimes G-d (as in the first chapter of Genesis), sometimes idols (as in the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0220.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Second Commandment</a>), sometimes the <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&pentid=P2081#C1374\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">court system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the ending <em>im</em> usually indicates plural. Keep in mind that <em>el</em> or <em>eloah</em> (often mispronounced as <em>eloha</em>) means \"a mighty one\" or \"force.\" As the pagans of the time believed in one god with power over this, one god with power over that, the Torah makes it clear that the entire creation was performed <em>Elohim</em>, i.e. by \"All Forces\" or \"Almighty\" (likely the best one-word translation for <em>Elohim</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>This focus on G-d's force also can refer to G-d's using a harsh attitude of judgment towards creation. The first block of sentences describing creation (Genesis 1:1 -- 2:3) are at this macroscopic scale, and thus <em>Elohim</em> is the description for G-d used there. The next block is an intermediate level, as humankind is trying to understand its boundaries here (2:3--4:1); the name used is \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tetragrammaton</a> (Yud - Heh - Vav - Heh) Elhoim\" (the Talmud says this refers to \"kind when in judgment\"). Finally, starting in Chapter 4, the name Man uses to refer to G-d is simply the Tetragammaton, a name that references G-d's mercy and existence beyond time. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Simple answer: it's not plural. </p>\n\n<p>Complex answer:</p>\n\n<p>Rambam addresses the apparent plurality of the word Elohim in the מורה נבוכים, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guide_for_the_Perplexed\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Guide for the Perplexed</a>. He addresses it for the sake of explaining passages where it sounds like Elohim could imply God is corporeal, but I think we can use his teachings to address this first passage. </p>\n\n<p>He states that its common knowledge that in Hebrew, Elohim is a word that can designate the diety (singular), the angels (plural), and the rulers governing the cities (plural), later he adds Judges (I.2 & II.6). And Onqelos gives an accurate translation of it. In the Creation passage he translates it simply as Yod-Yod, a singular name of God.</p>\n\n<p>So when Elohim is describing God, it is the singular form of the word, but if the word is describing angels and rulers then it can be plural.</p>\n\n<p>You could also say the name \"Elohim\", when referring to the Diety imparts the many  definitions of the word to God. So while God himself is singular, his attributes are plural. He is the  God of gods Ruler of rulers, Judge of judges (all referring to his superiority above the angels).</p>\n\n<p>In chapter I.61, Rambam says that \"all the names of God, may He be exalted, that are to be found in any of the books derive from actions\" (except the name Y,H,V,H). And he says in II.6, 'God only acts through an angel (messenger)'.</p>\n\n<p>If we then take it all and tie it together then we can interpret \"Elohim\" in first passuk to mean (the singular) God (Elohim) creates the heavens and earth through the use of his messengers/angels/rulers/judges (Elohim), of which God is the ruler (Elohim), and Judge (Elohim).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226502309\" rel=\"nofollow\">the guide of the perplexed I</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226502317\" rel=\"nofollow\">the guide of the perplexed II</a></p>\n\n\n",

Evil is only a possibility that arises when Good is created. (If God created \"up\" then \"down\" is a necessary possibility, but not a certainty.</p>\n\n<p>The creation story says God created light and it was \"good\". So, how do we interpret that? Rambam understands \"good\" to mean something that conforms to 'God's will'.  When God created the heavens and the Earth there was an element of uncertainty (chaos) to his creation. There was a chance, due to the randomness built into nature, that our world wouldn't have been the way it is now. So when it says the light is \"good\" it means that it was created just as God wanted it to be, it conformed to his will. If however, the photon for instance had been slightly smaller or heavier, the entire universe wouldn't have been formed as we know it, and it wouldn't have been \"good\". </p>\n\n<p>Judaism is all about following the mitzvot in the Torah, because man has a free will, and the \"knowledge of Good and Evil\" and Man can use this intelligence to choose to conform to God's will and do things that are \"good\" or man can act in a way that doesn't conform to God's will, and that is considered \"bad\" and creates evil. For example things like murder and stealing are evils brought about by man acting against God's will, and to refrain from them is a \"good\" action which conforms to God's will.</p>\n\n<p>So there are two ways that evil happens and neither of them are brought about by God. First is through randomness built into nature, as necessary accident that comes along when God is creating \"good\" things that conform to his will, and the second is by man bringing evil into the world by not acting as God wants us to.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226502309\" rel=\"nofollow\">the guide of the perplexed I</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226502317\" rel=\"nofollow\">the guide of the perplexed 2</a></p>\n\n\n",

That place is the Temple in Jerusalem. </p>\n\n<p>Today the Temple does not stand; it's unclear exactly where on the Temple Mount area the altar stood; there are numerous uncertainties regarding other prerequisites for sacrifice (such as the required garb for the priests); and let's not even get into today's hot-button political reality in Jerusalem! For these reasons and others, animal sacrifice is not done today. However on Sabbaths and holidays, our prayers clearly say that we hope to be brought back to a rebuilt Temple and offer the required sacrifices once again.</p>\n\n<p>Now as the Prophets made clear time and time again (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a15.htm\">I Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1001.htm\">Isaiah 1:10-18</a>, and so many others)  -- G-d is interested in sacrifices only so much as they mean following His will. If the people are out there doing all sorts of other horrible things but bringing nice sacrifices, then sacrifices shmacrifices. Here's Isaiah (with slight paraphrasing) just so you get the sense:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Listen to the word of G-d, you people who have become as corrupt and selfish as those of Sodom: What do I need with all your sacrifices, says G-d; I've had enough with burned rams and the fat of well-fed animals; the blood of cows, sheep, and goats? I don't want it. When you approach My Presence in the Temple, who asked you to do this, trampling all over my yard?! Cease and desist, bringing false gifts; incense has become disgusting to Me. New-months, Sabbaths, designated holidays? I can't deal with the sin at these gatherings. I hate your new-months and holidays, they've become a burden I'm tired of bearing. And when you raise your hands in prayer ... I'm not listening -- your hands are full of [innocent] blood. Instead -- clean yourselves off! Get rid of the wrongdoing! Learn to do good, seek justice, improve the lot of the disenfranchised; give justice to the orphan and pursue the case of the widow. Let's make a deal, says G-d; if your sins were like bright crimson, they can become white as snow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, sacrifices as part of the worship of G-d help, but Judaism goes on without them. As far as atonement, the Laws of Repentance were described by the Talmud and codified by rabbis long ago. We are obligated to recognize our sins, confess them to G-d, regret them, accept upon ourselves to do better, and make good on that acceptance. If we do that, we've done our part. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>To answer a few of your questions, since there is no temple since the second was destroyed two millennia ago, there are no sacrifices.

This rule is quoted without citation at the end of most <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArtScroll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Artscroll</a> <em>t'filos</em>. Is one required to stand silently during this brief pause, or can it be filled with words of supplementary prayers such as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יְהִי רָצון מִלְּפָנֶיךָ ה' אֱ-להֵינוּ וֵא-להֵי אֲבותֵינוּ. שֶׁיִּבָּנֶה בֵּית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ בִּמְהֵרָה בְיָמֵינוּ. וְתֵן חֶלְקֵנוּ בְּתורָתֶךָ: \n  וְשָׁם נַעֲבָדְךָ בְּיִרְאָה כִּימֵי עולָם וּכְשָׁנִים קַדְמונִיות: \n  וְעָרְבָה לה' מִנְחַת יְהוּדָה וִירוּשָׁלָיִם. כִּימֵי עולָם וּכְשָׁנִים קַדְמונִיות:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It says in Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14326&st=&pgnum=167&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 122:2</a>) that once one says yehyu leratzon, one can interrupt to say Tachanunim (extra prayers). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you say the \"Yehi ratzon\" that you mentiond, then you should pause and wait, after saying such prayers.  After the last bracha of the shemonah esraei, you can add any prayers that you want. When you are done with all those prayers, then you should pause, and take steps back.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, one would insert the yehi-ratzon before \"Oseh Shalom\". Since it appears (though I have no source) that stepping back while saying Oseh Shalom has some significance... as done during Kadish.  To explain further:  During the full kadish, the kadish ends with Oseh Shalom, and it is the custom in most places to bow left and right, and take three steps back during that phrase.  Since this is the same activity done at the end of the Shemonah esrei (taking 3 steps back), it seems, from practice, that one should take the three steps back while saying oseh shalom.  That being the case, when you are done with the shemonah esrei, you also have to take 3 steps back, so it seems to me, that it would make most sense to do both at the same time. (which would involve saying yehi ratzon before Oseh Shalom).  The fact that no siddurim actually have the text in that order, seeems to indicate I'm mistaken a bit here, but its what I was told once in a Shiur.   I am not sure why the halacha would be that after you \"bow out\", you then say another prayer ... you've just walked away!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't the Kabbalistic doctrine of Sefirot considered Shittuf if the Christian Trinity is?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From the answers <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/89/759\">to this question</a> it seems that most if not all Jewish sources treat <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Trinitarian</a> Christianity (in particular, their doctrine of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Trinity</a>) as either Shittuf or outright Avoda Zara, both of which (if there is a difference) are expressly forbidden for Jews to believe.</p>\n\n<p>For background, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity explains the Godhead as: \"the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God\" (in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_creed\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Athanasian Creed</a>) and therefore Christians would seem to be monotheists, except that God has parts or aspects which cannot be understood but together comprise God's unity (since the Trinity is classified as a 'mystery'). It is this doctrine which is problematic in Jewish sources (which were, of course, not written by Christian theologians but Jewish ones whose understanding of Christian doctrine was probably similar to the level I just presented).</p>\n\n<p>In the Jewish Kabbalistic doctrine of Sefirot, there are 10 Sefirot which are often described as either parts of God's \"body\" (each corresponding to a different limb) or manifestations or emanations, which although separate, with unique properties and sometimes male or female associations, nevertheless somehow do not contradict that God remains unified and indivisible. His unity is also, in this sense somewhat mysterious.</p>\n\n<p>The Rivash (Rabbi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Sheshet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaac Ben Sheshet</a>, 14th Century) famously wrote in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19989&pgnum=77\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a responsum, #157</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.וכל זה הוא דבר זר מאוד בעיני מי שאינו מקובל כמו הם; וחושבים, שזה אמונת שניות. וכבר שמעתי אחד מן המתפלספים מספר בגנות המקובלים, והיה אומר: הנוצרים מאמיני השילוש, והמקובלים מאמיני העשיריות<br>\n  And all this is very foreign in my eyes, as someone who is not a Kabbalist such as myself; and they think is is dualist theology...and I heard one of the ones who philosophizes speaking to the detraction of the Kabbalists, saying: the Christians believe in 3 and the Kabbalists believe in 10.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the Christian doctrine of the Trinity as understood by Jews is deemed Shittuf/Avoda Zara by them, is the Kabbalistic doctrine of Sefirot considered that as well?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any reason to distinguish between the Christian divided/united God as understood by Jews (and deemed by them problematic) and the Kabbalistic one?</p>\n\n<p>(Note that I am not interested in whether the doctrine of incarnation is problematic from a Jewish perspective. I would like to explore merely the question of a multipart Godhead and whether there is any reason to distinguish Christian and Jewish beliefs in that regard alone. Is there some difference in the perspective on the \"parts\"? Or a difference in the interpretation of the level of independence of the \"parts\"? Or a difference in regards their unification/unity? Or is there not fundamental difference aside from incarnation?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 29)\n\n<p>The straightforward answer to this question is that whereas the Christians are discussing what Hashem is made up of, the Kabbalists are discussing the ways in which He chose to reveal Himself.</p>\n\n<p>Just like we can understand that ה' ממית ומחיה is not reminiscent of trinity, since it is simply a reflection of what Hashem will do about different circumstances, the different specific behaviors which Hashem designated and designed for Himself to operate therewith are not in any way a statement about His composition — which is only one and endless.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out to be quite the contrary. Kabbalah teaches that Hashem Himself does not have a specific character. Without the teachings of Sefiros, when we attribute titles to Hashem we might be running into the problem of applying plurality to Him who is One. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is a good question and answer but I wanted to give a shorter answer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>According to the Arizal all sefirot and all of creation emanated from the Ein Sof - the infinite. The sefirot are not Ein Sof, they are not G-d himself, rather emanations. Everything in Kabbala describes emanations from G-d and not G-d himself since we cannot comprehend G-d himself</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Christianity considers a person to be G-d or part of G-d. Jewish scholars argued whether this would be considered idolatry (Rambam) or shituf (believing in both G-d and a partner to G-d, Tosfot) but all agree that this is forbidden in Jewish law and antithetical to Jewish belief.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a translation of the Arizal <a href=\"http://www.hebrew.grimoar.cz/vital/ec_chajim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Original Hebrew</a>):</p>\n<p>Know that before anything was emanated or created there was a lofty simple light that filled all existence with no empty space rather all was filled with an infinite simple light with no beginning or end rather all an equal simple light, and this is the point of Ohr Ein Sof. And when G-d wanted to create the worlds and emanate the emanations, to bring to fruition his actions and names, which is the point of the creation of the worlds, he contracted himself, the infinite, into the middle point, the very middle point, and contracted the light ...</p>\n<p>Here is what tosfot says:</p>\n<p>It is permissible to [cause a gentile's oath through litigation with one's non-Jewish partner because] today all swear in the name of the saints to whom no divinity is ascribed. Even though they also mention God's name and have in mind another thing, in any event no idolatrous name is actually said, and they also have the Creator of the world in mind. Even though they associate (shituf) God's name with \"something else\", we do not find that it is forbidden to cause others to associate (shituf), and there is no issue of placing a stumbling block before the blind (see Leviticus 19:14) [by entering into litigation with the non-Jewish business partner, thereby causing him to take an oath] because Noachides were not warned about it (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shituf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think the best way to understand the statement of the Rivash is to understand the disagreement that Mikubalim have with the Rambam's statement of הוא היודע הוא הידוע והוא הדיעה עצמה, (He is the knower, he is the known and He is the knowledge itself) where they qualify its applicability. This is explained somewhat at length in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16082&st=&pgnum=102&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mitvas Hemanas HaElokus</a> in Derech Mitzvosecha from the Tzemach Tzedek (the third Lubavitcher Rebbe), where he quotes the earlier Kabbalists who specifically speak to the Rambam's philosophy and argue with it. Although the statement of הוא היודע הוא הידוע והוא הדיעה עצמה is still accepted, it is qualified (see the link for details).</p>\n\n<p>To those following the Rambam's philosophy, intellect is bound to the essence of G-d. (This is why those of that opinion regard G-d as doing something illogical as impossible, as it is part of the definition of Source of existence - such I heard from my teacher in Yeshiva). As the Alter Rebbe explains the kabbalistic view in Tanya (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029203/jewish/Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Part 2, Chapter 9</a> - referenced in the above work from the Tzemach Tzedek) intellect and logic are creations as far as G-d is concerned. Rather G-d is פשוט בתכלית הפשיטות - beyond all structure and definition.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can understand that someone seeing these things through the Rambam's philosophical lens hears definitions of intellect divided into three parts and then additional emotional attributes, all attributed as being Divine, they associate the 10 Sefiros with the idea of the Christian belief, as they think all of these things are supposed to be as the Rambam describes intellect.</p>\n\n<p>But the Rambam's whole definition is that this is not something specific, distinct, defining. The Rambam <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1102.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a> אבל הבורא--הוא ודעתו וחייו אחד, מכל צד ומכל פינה:  שאלמלא היה חי בחיים ויודע בדעה, היו שם אלוהות הרבה--הוא וחייו ודעתו - However the creator, He and His knowledge and His life are one, from all sides and corner, because if he lived with the life of living things and knew with knowledge, there would be many gods - Him, His life and His knowledge. Rather the Rambam's whole idea is that this is something incomprehensible about G-d himself, and is specifically rejecting the idea of Divine attributes in G-d himself, as this would create multiple deities, ח\"ו.</p>\n\n<p>But when Kabbalists start talking about distinct attributes that are combined, creating unities, etc. they (the philosophers, as the kabbalists refer to them) still hear these as Divine attributes, as if Him, His life, His knowledge, and start making associations with Christians who say the same kinds of things about their three parts, but the Christians mean G-d Himself, ח\"ו.</p>\n\n<p>This all stems from the fundamental misunderstanding that Kabbalists are speaking in the same terms as the Rambam. They are not. Rather, as <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029203/jewish/Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">quoted</a> from the Alter Rebbe above, these aspects of Sefiros are creations. The Tzemach Tzedek specifically uses this word in order to make the idea clear.</p>\n\n<p>As a post script, I should add that in Kabbalistic works sefiros will not be referred to as creations rather emanations. This is because creation (ברא) in Kabbalah is a specific term of art. In Kabbalistic terminology, something created isn't just anything that G-d made, rather a creation is something with some distinct identity. The word ברא meaning something created as separate, something novel or different, whereas Sefiros express G-d without any identity other than G-d. They lack independence. This is why they are called emanations (נאצלים). However, sefiros are all things made after the Tzimtzum, forces that G-d makes as mediums to interact with the world, and for the world to relate to Him. They are as far from G-d as physical touch is to deep philosophical ideas, in fact infinitely further (see the Tanya <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029203/jewish/Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">quoted</a> above).</p>\n\n<p>Concerning this question, however the point is better made using the more commonly understood term of creation, which is how this answer should be understood. The Tzemach Tzedek also uses the word creation here (rather than the Kabbalistic sense) for the purpose of making that point clear.</p>\n\n\n",

So, what is the difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The names of nefesh, ruach, neshamah, yechidah, chayah (in that order) is from Bereishis Rabba 14:11.</p>\n\n<p>I wish to add two more positions to the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The first is Rav Saadia Gaon's (Emunos veDeios 6:3). Rav Saadia Gaon was an Aristotilian rationalist, although to a lesser extent than the Rambam, who had to deal with the topic when writing a commentary to Seifer haYetzirah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.. When [the soul] is attached to the body, one can see it three abilities:\n  - the power of choice\n  - the power of desire\n  - the power of anger\n  Therefore it is called in our language by three names: nefesh, ruach and neshamah.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is hinted in the name \"nefesh\" that is has the power of desire, \"for the taavah of your nefesh\" (Devarim 12:20), \"his nefesh was satisfied of desire\" (Iyov 33:20).</p>\n  \n  <p>And it is hinted in the name \"ruach\" that is has the power of being annoyed and angry, when it says \"do not become empty through your ru'ach by getting angry\" (Qoheles 7:9), \"his entire ruach brings out foolishness\" (Mishlei 29:11).</p>\n  \n  <p>And it is hinted in the name \"neshamah\" that it has the power of wisdom, as it says \"the 'Neshamah' of Shakaai will understand them\" (Iyov 32:8), \"and the neshama of who came out of you\" (Iyov 26:4)</p>\n  \n  <p>Because of these [seprable] abilities, the one who made it to be two parts erred, that one of them is in the heart and the other in the rest of the body. Rather, all three are in the soul (nefesh) alone. So the language added two more terms, they are \"chayah\" and \"yechidah\". It is called \"chayah\" because it exists through that which its Creator persists it. But it is \"yechidah\" because there is nothing like it among all the [other] creations, neither in the heaven, nor on earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rav Saadia Gaon, there is one indivisible soul, but it has three sets of abilities -- the emotions that draw us to people and things (desire), those that drive us away from them (anger), and thought. The soul has different names, depending upon context, upon whether we are talking about one of these three abilities, its ability to persist, or its uniqueness</p>\n\n<p>The other opinion I wish to add or perhaps two opinions, is that of the Vilna Gaon and R' Chaim Volozhiner:</p>\n\n<p>R. Chaim Volozhiner explains Nara”n based on the breathing imagery used in Bereishis 2:5:</p>\n\n<p>וַיִּיצֶר֩ ה אֱ-לֹקים אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֗ם עָפָר֙ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה וַיִּפַּ֥ח בְּאַפָּ֖יו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים וַיְהִ֥י הָֽאָדָ֖ם לְנֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה׃\nAnd Hashem G-d formed man of dirt from the ground and He breathed into his nostrils a living neshamah; and the man became a living nefesh.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Chaim writes (Nefesh haChaim 1:15):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Rabbis za”l already compared the three-fold living ru’ach of man to the making of a glass utensil to reviving the dead. They said, “It is a qal vachomer (a fortiori) argument from a glass utensil, which is made by the breath of flesh and blood… Flesh and blood, which is made by the breath of HaQadosh Baruch Hu, how much more so!”…\n  For the message must be similar to the metaphor. When we study the breath of the mouth of the worker into the glass container when he makes it, we find in it three concepts. The first idea is when the breath of air is still in his mouth, before it goes into the opening of the hollow tube, we can only call it then a “neshimah”. The second idea, when the breath enters the tube, and continues like a line, then it is called “ru’ach” (wind). The third, lowest, idea, is when the breath goes from the tube and into the glass, and inflates in it until it becomes a container to fit the will of the glass-blower, then his wind stops and is called “nefesh”, a term of rest and relaxation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The soul is likened to the breath of air that a glass blower uses to inflate hot glass. The Nefesh haChaim, following a far older metaphor, breaks down both processes into three parts. The first is the air, as it is still in the glassblower’s cheeks. This corresponds to the neshamah, the part of man which is most connected to Hashem. When the air leaves the glassblower’s mouth, it flows down a tube. The tube connects the glassblower and his work. In the same sense, the ru’ach dwells in the connection between the physical and the spiritual. This flow, a wind, is the ru’ach. From the tube, the air enters the glass, “dust of the ground”. This is the nefesh, giving shape and purpose to our physical selves.</p>\n\n<p>This metaphor gives us another description of how the ru’ach, by being the decisor, also becomes a source of desires. Recall that I started this series with the notion that the ru’ach, man’s existence in the world of his own mind and in a relationship to himself, was a the person between the angel and the little devil propped on his shoulders. And yet now we’re saying it has desires too! The ru’ach is the connection between the nefesh and the neshamah, it exists because of the tension between being both Divine “breath” and clothed in earth. Yet, because it sits in this middle world, the ru’ach is also an entity in its own right.</p>\n\n<p>The the Vilna Ga’on is in his discussion (Peirush al Kamah Agados, Koenigsburg ed. pg 10b) of the following gemara: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The elders of the School of Athens said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chanania,] “Build us a house in the air of the world.” He pronounced a [Divine] Name, and [thereby] suspended himself between heaven and earth and said to them, “Send me bricks and cement from down there.”\n  They said, “Can anyone find the ability to lift them to there?”\n  [R. Yehushua] said, “Can anyone find the ability to build a house in the air?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gaon explains that the house in the air is clearly a reference to the ru’ach, suspended between heaven and earth. (After all, the word “ru’ach” also means “wind”.)</p>\n\n<p>The ru’ach has the ability to decide, and thus the concept of Free Will. With will comes a desire to see that will implemented, to make the worlds outside ones head match the world as we imagine it could be. With will comes a hunger for power and control. Rather than being the means to get things done, they can take over and satisfying them can become an end in itself.</p>\n\n<p>A person has control over an object when he possesses it. And money gives a person more opportunities to get more of his dreams accomplished. When, sadly, someone turns it into an end in itself, they can never be satisfied. The hunger is for a means, which can only be put to trying to get more. “He who has 100 zuz, wants 200.”</p>\n\n<p>This is an aspect of the nefesh as a whole. It’s clear that the role of mitzvos between man and himself are not given the same central role in Jewish discourse as those between man and G-d and between man and other people. This is because they are not an end. The point is not self-contemplation. To be the perfect self is to be perfect in one’s relationships, the same three relationships.</p>\n\n<p>… including the relationship with oneself. This self-reference is a concept that comes up often when dealing with the concept of intelligence. And self-awareness, consciousness of one’s own thought, is the essence of the nefesh, of making Free Willed choices.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Accoding to the Rambam in \"the Guide of the Perplexed\", (and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8921/702\">WAF</a> above), the meaning of the words\nin each individual case are to be determined by the\ncontext.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ruach:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Ruach is a homonym, signifying\" air,\" that is, one of the four\n  elements.  </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"And the air of God moved (Gen. i. 2).</em></p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>It denotes also,\" wind.\" In this sense the\n  word occurs frequently.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"And the east wind (ruach) brought the\n    locusts\" (Exod. x. 13):\" west wind\" (ruach) (ib. 19).</em></p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>Next, it signifies\" breath.\" </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"A breath (ruach) that passeth away,\n    and does not come again\" (PS. lxxviii. 39) wherein is the breath\n    (ruach) of life\" (Gen. vii. 15).</em></p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>It signifies also that which remains of man after his death, and is\n  not subject to destruction. </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"And the spirit (ruach) shall return\n    unto God who gave it\" (Eccles. xii. 7).</em></p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>The Hebrew ruah when used in reference to God, has\n  generally the fifth signification: sometimes, however, as explained\n  above, the last signification, viz., \"will.\"</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nefesh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>The Hebrew nefesh (soul) is a homonymous noun, signifying the\n  vitality which is common to all living, sentient beings. </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"wherein there is a living soul\" (nefesh) (Gen. i. 30).</em> </p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>It denotes also blood,\" as in</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"Thou shalt not eat the blood (nefesh) with the meat\" (Deut. xii. 23).</em></p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>Another signification of the term is \"reason\", that is, the\n  distinguishing characteristic of man, as in </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>\"As the Lord liveth that made us this soul\" (Jer. xxxviii. 16).</em> </p>\n  </blockquote></li>\n  <li><p>It denotes also the part of man that remains after his death\n  (nefesh, soul) </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>\"But the soul (nefesh) of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life\" (I Sam.

The latter calls God \"The father of mercy\".[1] But the former makes no sense to me at all: it translates literally as calling God \"Father the mercy\", with <em>father</em> being a noun as before.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this <em>nusach</em> have this wording? And how do its proponents explain the phrase?</p>\n\n<p>Footnotes:<br>\n[1] Translation of רַחֲמִים as \"mercy\" here is approximate, but the issue is beside the point.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7940/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\">Lessons In Tanya, Iggeres Hateshuvah, ch. 7</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are two distinct states of Divine compassion, indicated by the\n  terms “Merciful Father” and “Father of Mercy”. The former term (אב\n  הרחמן) merely signifies that G‑d possesses the attribute, or <em>middah</em>,\n  of mercy — and since <em>middah</em> means not only “attribute” but also\n  “measure”, it refers to a finite quality of mercy. The latter term\n  (אב הרחמים) stresses the fact that G‑d is the father, or fountainhead,\n  of all mercy. Arousing His essential quality of mercy “from the Source\n  of mercy” thus means arousing His infinite measure of compassion —\n  supreme compassion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>- and thus we use the phrasing אב הרחמים at times when this essential quality is more evident (for example, at Minchah on Shabbos, which Kabbalistically is a time of great Divine favor, רעוא דכל רעוין).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As msh210 pointed out, though, I've misunderstood his question: it was about why אב הרחמים has a kamatz in Chabad siddurim, not about the difference of אב הרחמים vs. אב הרחמן.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l himself had the same question. In his notes on the Siddur Tehillas Hashem (\"Rostov Siddur\") of 1941, he <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15722&pgnum=29\">comments</a> that it would seem that the correct grammatical form should be with a patach. In a later series of notes on Siddur Torah Ohr, he makes the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15722&pgnum=39\">same</a> <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15722&pgnum=43\">observation</a> but concludes, evidently after consultation with his father-in-law and predecessor R. Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, that it should be left with a kamatz.</p>\n\n<p>No reason is given, although perhaps it is indeed related to the idea above, that אב הרחמים represents the idea that the אב Himself <em>is</em> רחמים rather than just possessing that quality.</p>\n\n\n",

If those mitzvot are not observed, then couldn't we say that those designated portions are intermingled with the rest of the produce, making the whole thing off limits?</p>\n\n<p>I suspect the answer is \"no,\" but I am curious about why.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Aaron, your guess is correct: the produce remains kosher whether it was shared with the poor or not.</p>\n<p>The only portions of the produce that have restrictions on its edibility are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>terumah</em>, which must be eaten by a Kohen while ritually pure</li>\n<li><em>terumat maaser</em>, which is the <em>terumah</em> given by the Levi.</li>\n<li><em>Ma'aser sheni</em>, should be kept ritually pure (<em>tahor</em>) and eaten in Jerusalem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence, the way Israeli produce is tithed today is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay here's 100 lbs of wheat. I take this one kernel and declare it <em>terumah</em>, I can't eat it as I'm not a <em>kohen</em>, but a <em>kohen</em> can't eat it as we're likely all <em>tamei</em>, so I'll just let it decompose. Now I designate the northern 10 lb of this wheat as <em>maaser</em>, which should be given to the Levi. Okay the Levi should give a tenth of that to the kohen, so the north-eastern 1 lb of this wheat (remove it) is hereby <em>terumat maaser</em>, again I just have to let it decompose. The other 9 lbs on the north are ordinary <em>maaser</em>, they're kosher for me to eat; if anyone can prove they're a Levi, come and get them. What, nobody here? Oh well. I'll just eat them myself then.</p>\n<p>The southern 10 lbs (well slightly less) are <em>ma'aser sheni</em>, I should take that wheat up to Jerusalem and eat it there, but it's <em>tamei</em> already, so I hereby transfer its sanctity onto this handy coin (which, as I can't use to buy non-<em>tamei</em> food in Jerusalem, I have to throw out). Okay, now I can eat the southern 10 lbs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The shares given to the Levi and poor are all about monetary ownership, not ritual status of the food. If gifts to the poor affected ritual status, we'd have to get into a complicated question of who's called sufficiently \"poor\" as to have a ritual effect. Yes the Talmud defines poverty with regards to who's entitled/allowed to receive these forms of charity, but how much money you have in the bank, to the best of my knowledge, does not affect ritual status in halacha.

    "content": "# asking to see a kashrus certificate\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A restaurant has a sign on its window, or a notation in an advertisement, indicating that it's under the <em>kashrus</em> certification of Rabbi So-and-so or Agency Such-and-such. The first time someone walks into the restaurant, he will ask to see the <em>t'uda</em>, the certificate from that rabbi or agency, and won't eat there if it can't be produced. (Not everyone will do this, presumably, but I know a good number of people who will.)</p>\n\n<p>However, that same person will walk into a supermarket, find a new (to him) product on the shelf with a reliable <em>kashrus</em> certification mark on it, purchase it, and eat it. He won't call the company and ask for a copy of the certification, or call the certifying agency and ask for confirmation of certification. (Again, some people will, but I think there are many who will skip this step for a product even though they follow it for a restaurant.)</p>\n\n<p>Why the double standard?</p>\n\n<p>Is it simply, as I suspect, a matter of ease: that it's easy to confirm certification for a restaurant (since the certificate is generally on the premises) but hard for a product? Or is there something else to it?</p>\n\n<p>And if it <em>is</em> simply a question of ease, then which of the following is true?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Really, there's no need to see the certificate, but since it's so easy we do so in a restaurant to be extra-careful.</li>\n<li>Really, one should preferably (or one must??) see the certificate, but since it's so hard we don't bother for a product.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I think the issue is not so much ease of verification as much as it is ease of forgery. It's a lot easier for a restaurant to lie and state on a sign that it is Kosher than it is for them to forge a certificate from a certifying agency and also have someone at the phone ready to lie and give false answers should someone call the number printed on the certificate.</p>\n\n<p>It's also much harder, by orders of magnitude, for a company to run an entire line of product with a false Kashruth label that they might then be forced to pull off of supermarket shelves and reprint/relabel, possibly costing them the entire run of their product if it's a perishable item. Instances of error and/or fraud in product labeling occur almost daily, so it's certainly not impossible, but it's a tremendous burden every time it happens.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Factory products are produced by big companies and are produced in bulk, which are scared to put a trademarked symbol on their product when everyone could see it, because they will be the subject of a huge lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>Small restaurants may be more willing to take the risk, and may hope that nobody notices their infringement. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think many people tend to check ingredients anyway for new products, since they are accustomed to many products with incorrect kosher labels. A quick visit to kashrut.com shows just how many products have incorrect kosher identifications on a regular basis, and one of the ways of catching those mistakes is by checking the ingredients. And since R. Moshe wrote that one can trust the ingredients list of a company (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=917&st=&pgnum=92&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 1:55</a>) that probably explains the practice to just check ingredients and not call the certifying agency (unless something in the ingredients looks amiss), whereas by a restaurant one cannot rely on an ingredients list.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are some:</p>\n\n<p>The first issue with using a computer on shabbat is electricity. Even though electricity is not fire, The Chazon Ish forbids it on account of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_on_Shabbat_in_Jewish_law#Building\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Building</a> through completion of a circuit. However, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (with whom I 100% agree) held that completing a circuit is no more building than closing a door is  (you'd be completing a wall).  </p>\n\n<p>The second issue with using a computer on shabbat could be writing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_on_Shabbat_in_Jewish_law#Computers_and_similar_appliances\" rel=\"noreferrer\">However</a>, due to a computer screen's temporary nature (the image disapears when turned off)  and it's flickering of the image, typing on a screen is not considered writing. It is even permited to erase Hashem's name from a computer screen.  </p>\n\n<p>Third, the screen could be considered a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_on_Shabbat_in_Jewish_law#Source_of_the_prohibition\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fire</a>. This is not the case though since while many hold an incandescent light bulb is fire, that is only because it gives off heat, a fluorescent bulb which doesn't give off heat is not considered fire, and a computer screen would fall under that category.</p>\n\n<p>So, even though electricity is not necessarily assur, and typing on a screen is not considered writing, and a screen is not a fire, I still wouldn't use electricity on shabat for a couple of strong reasons. </p>\n\n<p>First, even though I think it should be allowed to turn on and off non-heat-producing gagets (radio, television, cellphone) I would still prohibit these items on account of using them is not being in the spirit of Shabbat. \nSecond, Rabbi Auerbach says it has become a custom not to use electricity on shabbat, and if I were to use electricity I would violate not-breaking a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_on_Shabbat_in_Jewish_law#Minhag\" rel=\"noreferrer\">minhag</a>. Additionally, by violating a custom, it would look like I'm not keeping shabbat (marat eyin).</p>\n\n<p>In summation, even though Electricity is probably ok, since it was prohibited it became a custom we can't break. And even though using a computer probably doesn't break any melachos, it's would still be prohibited since it isn't in the spirit of shabbat. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would argue that — yes — using the internet on Shabbat is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>I would base my argument on three reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The concept of 'Nolad' (new things which didn't exist before Friday). (90% of what you would be looking at on the internet would have been created that day.)</li>\n<li>There is a general concept about not doing things which is not in the spirit of shabbat, even if you doesn't violate any actual melacha.  (For example, talking about business on Shabbas.)</li>\n<li>Looking at the internet potentially violates two melachot.  Writing, and Dyeing.</li>\n<li>There is a generally accepted practice to refrain from actively interacting with eletrical devices on Shabbat, unless there is a great need for shabbat, and the action which you do is only activated via a grama.  while not violating any specific melacha, this has become the custom of Shabbat-observant Jews worldwide.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate if anyone who knows can help me find sources — i.e. which pages in tractate Shabbat these topics come up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Would the internet be considered muktzeh due to Nolad (a new thing)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a category of muktzeh on shabbat called Nolad. Nolad means literally, something that is born on shabbat.  It is interpreted in the modern era, as meaning anything which you did not have access to before shabbat, you can not make use of on shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Mail for example (in countries that deliver on shabbat) is considered Nolad.  An egg laid on shabbat is a classic example.</p>\n\n<p>If we found a way to access the internet without breaking shabbat, (through some advancements in technology) would the content accessible through said technological advancement be considered nolad?</p>\n\n<p>My rationale is as follows.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Facebook is updated by the minute, so social networks have new content from people.. what you are reading was likely written within the past 12 -24 hours.</p></li>\n<li><p>Websites are generated dynamically.  When you load a page, it instantly calculate which ads to show, which content to display etc. This layout and what things you see from second to second, as a single unit, I would argue is nolad.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you visit a website, it updates your cookies, or the page hit counter, which update and are displayed with that new information (tracking, or on the site itself)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Arguments against:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The programs existed before shabat, as did most of the content, it is only being displayed differently.</p></li>\n<li><p>You don't physically touch the internet, so it can't really have a muktzeh status.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p><em>Nolad</em> governs <em>muktzeh</em>, physical items you shouldn't <em>move</em> because they weren't acessible before shabbos started.</p>\n\n<p>I can't see any way how that could possibly apply to information. If a non-Jew who had been halfway across the world on Friday night delivers a package to me on shabbos afternoon, it's <em>muktza</em>. If he tells me a joke (or the news, or acts out a play), we have no such rule governing it.</p>\n\n<p>Further proof is a well-known incident whereby the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Zvi_Yehuda_Berlin\"><em>Netziv</em></a> was sent a telegram on <em>yomtov</em>; a non-Jew came and delivered it to him, and he read it: the entire yeshiva was celebrating <em>Shavuos</em> if I recall, and the telegram's news was that his sister had passed away. He continued with the festivities until the holiday ended, at which point he broke down on the floor sobbing.</p>\n\n<p>I am bothered by the question \"if somehow you could surf online on shabbos ...\" and looking for some loophole requirement for/against what you're doing online at that point. We're all so wired, connected, have-to-have-the-latest 24-7 throughout the week, that it's really important that on Shabbos we just let it go and see how G-d's world still manages to function without my tweets (or anyone else's, for that matter).</p>\n\n<p>So you could argue about the spirit of shabbos, as learned from things like <em>nolad</em>. But the actual prohibition of <em>nolad</em> per se, as you're proposing, is completely irrelevant here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that Nolad may also requires the non-Jew to do it specifically for you or mostly for Jews.

Is it brought down anywhere?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When members of the tribes of R'uven and Gad approached Moshe to unwaveringly request settlement on the east bank of the Jordan, apart from the rest of the nation, Moshe responded emphatically in the negative. He laid out conditions (which entailed participation in the upcoming conquest of the land west of the Jordan) under which they would be allowed to proceed with their bucolic dream. Once they had agreed to the terms, Moshe apportioned the land. All of this can be found in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>B'midbar</em> 32:1-32</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But when it came time for the actual dividing up of territories, not only were the two tribes who had been involved in the negotiations allotted land, but another (partial) tribe was added - that of M'nashe. Since there was a dangerous endemic mentality among those two tribes who chose to split off for less than righteous reasons, Moshe paired them with a remedial force to counteract their divisive spirit. The tribe whose defining characteristic was unity and <em>in</em>\tclusion was M'nashe, as exemplified by 5 of its members, the daughters of Tz'lafchad. They objected to the very hint of exclusion of their father's family from the rest of the nation (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%9B%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>ibid.</em> 27</a>:4) because they possessed this crucial trait.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes I've definitely heard that before -- and also, putting half of Menashe on one side, so they'd know to stay connected to their cousins on the other side.</p>\n\n<p>It's in the Stone Chumash page 915, quoting Degel Machaneh Ephraim.

It has physical controls to turn pages. (This question is not about the newer ones with touch screens.)  If left unused it enters a sleep mode, and you can return to reading by moving a (physical) button.  Returning from sleep mode causes a light (LED? not sure what it is, but not heat-emitting) to flash.  Here is <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/182104\">some information about how e-ink works</a> (h/t Shokhet).</p>\n\n<p>If the device is already turned on at the start of Shabbat and the reading material itself is not objectionable (that is, there'd be no problem if you were reading the exact same book on paper), is its use permitted or forbidden on Shabbat?  Please bring sources/arguments either way.</p>\n\n<p>This question is not about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8968/is-using-the-internet-on-shabbat-against-melachos\">using the Kindle's web browser to access the Internet</a>.

It seems to me that consuming text would be different from typing it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>No, it is not permitted to use a Kindle or any other electronic e-reader on Shabbat or Yom Tov (Chol Ha'Moed may be a different story).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are two primary halachic issues with using such a device on Shabbat or Yom Tov:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The usage of electricity</li>\n<li>The creation of letters</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The Usage of Electricity</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a debate amongst contemporary <em>poskim</em> as to what the prohibition of using electricity is on Shabbat and Yom Tov. Rav Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (commonly known as the Chazon Ish) was of the opinion that all applications of electricity would fall into the category of <em>Boneh</em>, the melacha of building and that these applications would be <em>deorita</em> or Torah prohibitions. Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, in his <em>SHu'T Achiezer</em> is of the opinion that electricity falls into the category of <em>ma'avir</em>, the melacha of kindling, and that the Torah prohibition only applies in a situation where heat is generated (ie. a light-bulb) but in other situations it would fall into the category of a Rabbinic prohibition (which may <strong>be</strong> taken lightly!). Still, other <em>poskim</em> (I believe, Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach)are of the opinion that applications of electricity fall into the category of <em>molid</em> or creating something new, which is a Rabbinic prohibition (again, see note above). Rav Moshe Feinstein, in his <em>Igrot Moshe</em> seems to be of the opinion that applications of electricity would not constitute a Torah prohibition, however he cautions not to take this issue lightly as there is a 'chance that it involves the Torah prohibition of <em>maakah b'patish</em> (the final hammer blow)'.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Info:</strong> Just found this Wikipedia page which, although I just skimmed it, appears to do a very good job presenting the issue: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_on_Shabbat_in_Jewish_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electricity on Shabbat</a></p>\n\n<p>Either way, whether applications of electricity are a Torah prohibition or a Rabbinic one, usage of a Kindle or other e-reader would be prohibited on the grounds that thousands of circuits are created and destroyed constantly as one uses the device.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Creation of Letters</strong></p>\n\n<p>The prohibition of <em>kotev</em>, the melecha of writing, extends far beyond simply writing letters, the prohibition extends to forming any meaningful images which convey a message (amongst other things). The <em>Mishna Berurah</em> discusses a case in which an individual take a letter made of silver and places it on a background (thus making the letter clear) and rules that this is prohibited as <em>kotev</em>, certainly in the case of a Kindle or other e-reader, where the letters are formed (as opposed to being ready made) and the device is designed to use a contrasting background to make them clear this would fall into the category of <em>kotev</em>. </p>\n\n<p>There will be those who argue that the prohibition of <em>kotev</em> only applies to something which is lasting (there is a debate as to the time-frame required for lasting, but most agree that it is 25 hours), but this argument is flawed. Firstly, this only reduces the prohibition to a rabbinic one (again, see note above). Secondly, I don't think the rule of lasting writing can be applied to this case based on the Rambam in his <em>Mishne Torah</em> where he discussed a case where a person writes on his skin with ink, even though the ink will certainly be erased by the person's sweat, it is nevertheless prohibited based on the fact that at the time of writing it was a permanent act. Based on the fact that the Kindle boasts a one month battery life, I would view each act of 'writing' as lasting for the purposes of <em>hilchot shabbat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, it is clear, for various reasons, that using any electronic device on Shabbat or Yom Tov is prohibited on either a Torah or rabbinic level and therefore forbidden (except in certain extenuating circumstances which are outside the scope of this post) and certainly adding the element of creating letters to the issue further compounds the prohibition and therefore using a Kindle or other e-reader device would be prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Aside from the electricity needed to change pages, I think the melacha that e-ink runs into is Tzovei'a (dyeing). You are not allowed to paint things, and color things, and dye things on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>The Kindle uses an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper#Electrophoretic\">Electrophoretic</a> display, where basically, reflective titanium particles are suspended in a dark fluid. They are electrically charged to move to the from the front sheet of the display where they would appear white, to the back of sheet of the display, letting us see the dark ink.

    "content": "# What evidence is required to indicate mamzer status?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems to me that just about every possible shadow of doubt is used to prevent halachic rulings that would classify a person as a <em>mamzer</em>. From my understanding after having read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamzer#Orthodox_Judaism\">this paragraph</a> on Wikipedia, if there is any possible way to discredit evidence of mamzer status, it will be done.</p>\n\n<p>However, this sort of evidentiality, where any sorts of loopholes to discredit evidence can be used, would be regarded as unjust if applied to other cases because it is a standard of evidence that is impossible to fulfill. It would seem that more effort is taken to prevent people from being classified as mamzerim than actually trying to find out if they are.</p>\n\n<p>What standard of evidence is necessary to indicate mamzer status? If it is higher than the standard of evidence necessary for other halachic rulings, what justifies the discrepancy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In Halacha there is a concept called \"Neemanus\", which means believability.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, in Halacha we need two kosher (not relative, not Rasha) witnesses. In certain cases, like by Kashrus of food, etc. we will be more lenient and rely on one witness, assumptions, etc. The reason for this difference is we follow a \"chazaka\" unless witnesses overturn it, so by money, the chazaka follows where the money is now (Hamotzei michaveiro alav haraya). By other cases (like Kashrus) there is no established chazaka, so we follow one witness, or other more lenient proofs </p>\n\n<p>A person born from a kosher person has a chazaka of being kosher, however, the Gemarah says that the father of the child is believed to say \"this child is a mamzer\", and it is derived from a pasuk. Therefore, there are two contrary forces at play, one chazaka is the child's natural chezkas kashrus, and the other is the Gzeiras Hakasuv.)</p>\n\n<p>What the poskim try to do it to invalidate the father's credentials (if he isn't religious, for example, we may disqualify him enough that the natural \"chezkas kashrus\" of the child kicks back in).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there is a gemarah in Kiddushin 72b that a mamzer who is not known as a mamzer is kosher, and one shouldn't publicize his mamzerus status, which means that we can play a bit more with mamzerus than with other issurim. </p>\n\n<p>Since, by definition, Mamzerus is a bdieved issue, and a serious bdieved issue, one that would cause him extreme hardship (So it would be more stringent that your usual \"hefsed mrubah\") we rely on the halacha, and rule leniently.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The evidence required would be 2 witnesses that Bais Din believes.</p>\n\n<p>There is a story with HaRav Moshe Feinstein Zatzal - where he was officiating at a wedding (Mesader Kedushin). At the last moment the Chassan's mother came over to HaRav Moshe and said that her son was born from a different man while she was a married women. HaRav Moshe without batting an eyelash said to continue the wedding as \"Aid Echod Aino Neeman B'Isurim\" - we do not trust one witness by such cases.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As written by others the Mamzer status requires the highest level of certainty.  However, other areas of halacha do not require the highest level of certainty. (For example, we do not require two valid witnesses to be a mashgiach in a kitchen)</p>\n\n<p>I believe the reasons for this is as follows.  There is a halachic principle to that laws of hashem are \"darchei Noam\" (They ways of Hashem are pleasant).  Therefore, in instances where the outcome is negetive (death penalty, mamzer, adultery, shabbat desecration etc.) we do our best to find reasons not to have the unpleasant outcome. (Sometimes this isn't possible, such as with an Aguna.. because we have competing unpleasant negative things)  When the outcome is a possitive one, (marriage, eating, day to day living etc..) then we apply a less rigorous test and have a lower bar of proof required.</p>\n\n<p>What is considered 'pleasant' and what is not considered pleasant I believe is based on criteria of halacha, and is not based on the feelings of the person being affected.  I.e., even if someone WANTS to be a mamzer, we still try to find ways to make it not be.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# לשון הקדש: the oldest language?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> to <em>B'reshis</em> 2:23 says that the language <em>Adam</em> spoke was one that <em>Rashi</em> calls לשון הקדש, <em>lashon hakodesh</em> (or <em>l'shon hakodesh</em>), and that contains the words אִשָּׁה and אִישׁ. Keeping to <em>Rashi</em>'s nomenclature but abbreviating, I'll here call it <em>lhk</em>. The <em>Tora</em> is written in lhk, as evidenced by the words אִשָּׁה and אִישׁ appearing in it. (That doesn't prove <em>all</em> the <em>Tora</em> is in lhk. But presumably large swaths of it are.) Moreover, <em>Rashi</em> (same place) says the world was created with, or in, or by means of, lhk.</p>\n\n<p>This implies that lhk is the oldest language in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Yet linguists will tell you that the language the <em>Tora</em> is in has ancestors, including Proto-Semitic and Proto-Afro-Asiatic. Of course these are dead, so that doesn't <em>quite</em> contradict anything above. But linguists will say further that these languages predated the language the <em>Tora</em> is in. That seems definitely to contradict the above.</p>\n\n<p>According to <em>Rashi</em>, do we simply disbelieve the linguists? Or is there some way to reconcile <em>Rashi</em> with them?</p>\n\n<p>And do other <em>rishonim</em> disagree with <em>Rashi</em> in such a way as to be more linguist-friendly? What do they hold?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Actually, Rashi doesn't say that Adam spoke lashon hakodesh. He says, מכאן שנברא העולם בלשון הקודש - from here we see that the world was created with LHK.</p>\n\n<p>Adam himself may have known other languages; in fact, the Gemara (Sanhedrin 38b) says that he spoke Aramaic. But names are significant in that they express the true reality of the object (see Tanya, Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah chs. 1, 7, and 12, that the Hebrew name of any being is a \"map\" of the Divine energy that went into its creation), so it's only natural that Adam would have chosen LHK, the language of creation, to name Chava.</p>\n\n<p>As for the \"single language\" of the Tower of Bavel builders: yes, Rashi says that it was LHK. But again, that doesn't have to mean that they knew no other language; different people may have already developed different languages (or dialects, at least), but they all had Hebrew as a common language. (Or, perhaps, everyone knew all of the languages, like Mordechai.) They might well have used different languages for different purposes, like Frederick the Great's \"I speak French to my ambassadors, English to my accountant, Italian to my mistress, Latin to my God, and German to my horse.\"</p>\n\n<p>The \"confusion of languages,\" then, would have involved: (a) people forgetting their common language of LHK, and (b) the scrambling of who spoke what other languages. So, for example, originally you and your relatives might have spoken both Hebrew and proto-Indo-European, whereas now one of you speaks PIE and the other speaks proto-Uralic, and neither one of you knows Hebrew anymore.</p>\n\n<p>In short, then, it may be not so much that LHK is the parent language of all others, but rather that it, as well as some other languages, are coeval with the creation of the world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam, in Moreh Nevuchim (3:8) says that Lashon Hakodesh is only given that term because it contains no indecent words.  He seems to reject the gemorah and other statements which seem to imply that Lashon Hakodesh was the first language.</p>\n<p>As for Rashi, I don't think you can reconcile Rashi's statements with linguists' without going the metaphor path, which is not what Rashi's words imply.  However, I also don't know how to reconcile what you wrote with the statements of the Talmud and other midrashim which state that the Bikkurim must be said in Lashon Hakodesh, and yet neither \"ish\" nor \"isha\" is found amongst those passages. Or the other statements which speak of all of Israel speaking Lashon Hakodesh in Israel during the time of the temple.</p>\n<p>The gemorah actually makes an interesting statement regarding the Torah.  It suggests that Torah was originally written in Hebrew script and Lashon Hakodesh, and was changed by Ezra to Ashuri script and Aramaic, and was eventually settled at Ashuri script and Lashon Hakodesh.\n<a href=\"http://quizlet.com/4779028/bible-intro-flash-cards/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This website here has some really interesting flash cards on the subject.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To directly answer the OP's question: There is a theory from Rabbi Y. Y. Zilberberg that claims that Adam did not really speak Lashon HaKodesh proper, rather he spoke a sort of proto-Lashon HaKodesh which later developed into Hebrew as we know it. This is from the book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1FwDM0q\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew</em></a> (Mosaica Press) by Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein on page 38-39:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yaakov Yehuda Zilberberg/Di Kasif (1914–2003)... explains that\n  Adam heard the sounds of nature and, in attempting to learn from them\n  and imitate them, he developed the first phonemes (the smallest units\n  of speech) from whence speech eventually developed. As mentioned\n  above, God did not teach him Lashon HaKodesh, rather He gave Adam the\n  necessary tools to intuit Lashon HaKodesh on his own. According to\n  this approach as well, Adam did not develop speech on his own; he\n  required special assistance from God in order to have the intelligence\n  required to learn from his surroundings.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Rabbi Zilberberg/Di Kasif’s view, the original language that Adam\n  spoke was simplistic and undeveloped, but was built on strong\n  foundations. The Adamic language only consisted of short words for the\n  most common things and ideas, but was based on a formula that allowed\n  it to vastly expand its vocabulary. This formula, without any\n  impurities, leads directly to Lashon HaKodesh. All other languages\n  that developed from the Adamic language are adulterated with unnatural\n  sounds and their distorted meanings. Thus,while Adam did not speak\n  Lashon HaKodesh as a fully developed language in the sense that we\n  understand it, the language that he spoke was the prototype of Lashon\n  HaKodesh. This proto–Lashon HaKodesh was a common ancestor of all\n  languages, but was the direct ancestor of Lashon HaKodesh. In view\n  of this, it is fair to state that on one hand Adam spoke Lashon\n  HaKodesh, and on the other hand also spoke Aramaic (and indeed all\n  seventy languages), because he did not literally speak those\n  languages; rather, he spoke in a way that followed a formula from\n  which those languages could develop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you look at <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1FwDM0q\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew</em></a> (Mosaica Press) in Chapter 2, he explains that Rashi's view that Lashon HaKodesh was the only language spoken before the Deluge is but one of two (or 3 opinions) in the Jerusalemic Talmud. The other opinion says that before the Deluge, everyone spoke all seventy languages and that at the Deluge people forget 69 languages and remembered only one, but different people remembered different languages. This approach is adopted by R. Yosef Bechor Shor, Chizzkuni, and Rabbeinu Chaim Paltiel.</p>\n\n\n",

I am not able to find the exact details though.</p>\n\n<p>If you can draw a comparison with the Muslim namaz (I am familiar with it) it would be very helpful but just describing the Jewish way of prayer would be as helpful. Any link to English language sites describing the same would also do.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>Ooh, where do I begin? Let me try to compare Jewish and Islamic prayer practices here...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Jews require ritual cleanliness for prayer, as Muslims do. While Muslims have wudu and ghusl, Jews simply wash their hands in a prescribed manner: thrice on the right, and thrice on the left.</li>\n<li>Jews have three prescribed prayer times, analogous to Islam's five. Shaharit is Judaism's Fajr (morning), Minha corresponds to 3asr in the afternoon, and 3arvit (popularly known as Maariv) corresponds to 3isha' at night.</li>\n<li>While Islam has an obligatory public prayer at Juma, Judaism encourages all prayer to be public (at least for males), especially on Shabbat (Saturday). Although a sermon/teaching is commonly made, it is not obligatory as the khutbah is.</li>\n<li>Some prayers are said out loud, while some are said silently. Some prayers (especially in the Middle East) are encouraged to be sung elaborately, like the adhan. Others are done silently to one's self, like the private recitation of al-Fatihah. Still others are chanted in unison, like the Terawih in China!</li>\n<li>Most Jews no longer do kneeling and prostration (sajdah), as is the common practice in Islam. However, a segment of Jews from Yemen still do this, and elements of it can be seen in the standard \"bend knees then bow\" method. In fact, the Mishneh Torah by Maimonides prescribes the \"right hand over left on chest looking down) position familiar to Muslims!</li>\n<li>Muslims have a tradition of reading the Qur'an in a musical chant. Likewise, Jews read the Scriptures publicly in a chant according to the punctuation marks (ta3amim). In certain Middle Eastern congregations (such from the Yemeni and Iraqi traditions), the scriptural chant sounds very much like tajweed! (Except done a tad faster, of course.)</li>\n<li>As Muslims face Mecca, Jews face Jerusalem (the original qibla). We are less strict about this, so must communities simply face due east (or due west, if they're east of Jerusalem).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You'll find these similarities and so much more. If you live anywhere near Mumbai, you can find the the remnant of the native Jewish community there. You can ask them, as they probably are better able to answer your questions than I am!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>To supplement, not supplant, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9048\">Gershon Gold's good answer</a>, I might add that we have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>prayers with a fixed text that everyone says (morning, afternoon, and evening, as Gershon Gold notes);</li>\n<li>additional prayers that individuals can compose and add into the aforementioned set prayers;</li>\n<li>short prayers with a fixed text said on a variety of occasions, including each time we eat; and</li>\n<li>individually composed prayers (though there are some that have become semistandardized) that can be said at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first and third of those — the set-script prayers — are preferably said in Hebrew, though can also be said in other languages; the others can be said in any language.

While not strictly taught in schools, I imagine you could fill an entire semester of college to answer just this one question.</p>\n\n<p>To start.  The official prayers in Judaism are a replacement of the sacrificial services done on the temple mount in Jeruslem. When the temple was destroyed, sacrifices were no longer capable of being given, and some reminder of those activities was needed.  However, saying that, prayers are said to have existed since the time of Abrahahm, Issac and Jacob.  Even when the temple was standing, people who could not make the pilgrimage would say prayers during the time of the sacrifices in lew of being able to be there.</p>\n\n<p>All Jews prayer facing the Temple Mount in Jeruselem.  That is where the old temple and Altar stood. However, if you are in a syngaggue, and there is a Torah scroll present, then one must pray facing the Torah Scroll.  To alleviate confusion, most Torah scrolls are placed facing Jeruselem (but sometimes that isn't possible)</p>\n\n<p>The text of the prayers differences from community to community, and wikipedia has an article on that here:  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusach\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusach</a></p>\n\n<p>The differences between nusach are usually very minor. A few grammatical corrections here, a few extra or less words there.  In general, a Jew visiting anywhere in the world can follow along with any prayer service.  However, there are few Jewish groups who have made more than minor changes to the prayers. Some of these are accepted as ok universally, some are not.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main types of prayers, known as the Shemah (Listen oh Israel), and the Amidah/Shemonah Esrei (The standing prayer, or the 18 blessings)  The Shemah is said sitting down, and has 2 blessings before the shemah, and 2 blessings afterwards, while the Shemah itself consists of 3 paragraphs.  More on that can be read about here:  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah</a>  and here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael</a></p>\n\n<p>There are other sections of prayer, depending on which service you are in.  One such section are known as Psukei Dzimra (passages of song) which normally consist of various pslams from the Tanach (Hebrew scripture)  Another common prayer is Ashrei  ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashrei\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashrei</a> ) Also, there is a section of prayer which is a translation of the \"Kedusha\" into Aramaic. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedushah\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedushah</a></p>\n\n<p>Lastly there is a prayer which is used to divide up the sections of prayers known as the Kaddish.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaddish</a></p>\n\n<p>Ok, not lastly.. there is also the prayer which is used to finish the services called Aleinu, ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleinu\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleinu</a>) and the song of the day which also comes from Psalms.</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish prayer service has many different parts where a person must stand, some parts where a person must sit, and some parts which can be done in either way.  In general, prayers that are 'more important', or where we are testifying our beliefs we stand. Also during the Amidah one must stand, and when the Torah is brought out.  Different communities have different customs in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Another point about prayer is that official Jewish Prayer normally breaks down into one of 3 categories. Thanks, Praise, or a Request. Anything that is not one of these categories is not 'officially' prayer. </p>\n\n<p>I know I'm leaving something out, so I'll add more if there are follow up questions.</p>\n\n\n",

This was very significant because in Jamaica (I believe unlike in the eventual US), slaves were permitted to work parcels of land and sell the produce at markets.  Accordingly, the slaves of Jews were able to plant more, sell more, and earn more money than those owned by non-Jews, who gave their slaves only half a day off on Saturdays, as well as Sundays.  For my reference to this, as well as the source in which I found it, see the book I wrote, \"Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight,\" page 62.   Jews in Jamaica thus adhered to the Biblical prescription that slaves, servants, etc., were to be able to rest on Saturdays, too; see the fourth of the  Ten Commandments (\"Exodus,\" chapter 20).  The owners in Jamaica clearly adhered to this Biblical command---though the slaves reportedly chose to work on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on his extensive research into the matter, I think we can conclude that this was the extent that Jewish slave owners observed slave-related commandments in the Americas.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>A friend and I were recently at the Princeton Art Museum, which contained a text from the Caribbean with a blessing on circumcising one's slaves:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gyoTG.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gyoTG.jpg\" alt=\"image of old book at Princeton art museum showing the relevant blessing\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I'm going to put some more information out there in addition to @Jeffery Mensch's above.

Remember that these Dutch-colony Jews were of Sephardic descent and spoke Judeo-Portuguese/Spanish as well as Portuguese and Dutch. This book, Berit Yitzchaq was published in 1768 (this particular copy is from Suriname). The 1768 edition is <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45367&st=&pgnum=34\" rel=\"noreferrer\">available on Hebrewbooks</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It was also published in 1729, with a slightly different text, though the preface to that edition indicates that the text is fairly old, having originated in the Holy Land and come through the Ottoman Empire to the Netherlands. However, that edition did not contain the circumcision rites. </p>\n\n<p>The 'Torat Ha-adam' section of the 1768 edition contains the circumcision rites, for all kinds of circumcision [living parents, dead father, etc.]. It also contains a section for the circumcision of slaves with the title \n\"סדר מילת עבדים וטבילתן בזמן שבית המקדש היה קיים\" \"the order of circumcision and immersion that was done when the Temple stood\". </p>\n\n<p>This introduction is strange to say the least. It is unclear if this was a tactic for hiding or disapproving of the institution of circumcizing slaves, or whether it was a text that sought to justify modern slavery. </p>\n\n<p>Other scholars have pointed out that in Curaçao the Jews did consider their slaves Jewish and circumcised them, while in Suriname they did not. However, both communities would have likely used the same prayer books printed in Amsterdam. There is some evidence that the organizer of Berit Yitzchaq had family in Suriname who did not circumcise their slaves. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that as seen in the register of mohalim (licensed circumcisers) printed in the back of the book, there were more mohalim (or at least more mohalim recognized by the Dutch Sephardic community) in Suriname and Curaçao than in London, Naarden, Haia, Hamburg, and Bayonne combined. </p>\n\n<p>However, it seems unlikely that the circumcision of slaves was widely practiced, even among slave-holding Jews. As far back as the Talmudic period, a category of “uncircumcized slaves” existed, with unique laws. This was especially important for the purpose of allowing slaves to work on the Sabbath, as circumcised slaves are required to observe the Sabbath the same as Jews. The important Sephardic rabbis of the 12th and 13th centuries, Maimonides and Nahmanides, both dealt extensively with the category of “uncircumcized slaves”, quietly advocating the end of circumcision. Ashkenazic (Jews of German/French/Polish origin) Jews would buy slaves on condition that they not be circumcised, thus de facto abolishing circumcision. It is highly unlikely that Dutch Jews would have reinstituted the practice on their own. </p>\n\n<p>So were Slave-related commandments practiced in America? Mostly not. But for some time in the 18th century in the Dutch colonies, they may have been. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For those interested in the picture, it is from an exhibit at the Princeton University Art Museum <a href=\"http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/exhibitions/1655\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/exhibitions/1655</a>. \n(Maduro, S.

    "content": "# How was flour measured in the bes hamikdash?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Modern cooks will tell you that the way to measure flour is to scoop flour with a scoop whose volume is known, and then to shave any excess off the top. (However, liquids are measured by pouring into a graded (that is, lined) receptacle until the desired line is reached.)</p>\n\n<p>Is that how they measured flour in the <em>bes hamikdash</em> also?</p>\n\n<p>The reason I ask is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=4503&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>M'nachos</em> 57:2</a> cites a <em>tana</em> as holding that utensils for measuring flour (\"dry measures\") were anointed as <em>k'le shares</em> (sanctified) only within, and not on their outside surfaces, whereas \"wet measures\" were anointed within and without. Other <em>tanaim</em> (see <em>Tosafos</em> s.v. \"<em>Rabi</em>\") maintain that dry measures were not anointed at all, while wet ones were.</p>\n\n<p>If flour was measured in the <em>bes hamikdash</em> by scooping, then it (I suppose) makes sense that the outsides of dry measures were not sanctified, as they'd want any flour that falls off after scooping, and back into the bin, not to be holy.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My understanding (based on brachos 52a+b, thank you zaq for the source) is that the issue of wet vs dry is an issue of Tumah.  (if a vessel is wet on the outside then something touching the outside sends tumah to that which is inside, but if the outside is not wet this doesn't happen.</p>\n\n<p>So a dry measuring cup should not be annointed on the outside is it causes needless risk of the dry things getting tumah.  A wet measuring device however, is allready likely to get wet on the outside, so no added risk is involved.</p>\n\n<p>Based on that logic, they could have both been measured in the same way, but had designated wet vs dry containers.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I was once told that the mincha offerings were measured via the hand for the actual offering.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A kiddush cup, which is tammeh on the outside, doesn't transfer tummah to your hand because the outside of the cup is dry.  </p>\n\n<p>Since your hand won't become tammeh before hamotze through just holding a tammeh-kiddush cup, Yekkies have the custom to wash before kiddush. However, most don't keep that custom because we are concerned that the wine, which itself can become tammeh, may drip onto the tammeh-exterior of the cup and become tammeh, and then, the tammeh-wine on the outside of the cup may touch your hand, making your hand tammeh before you make hamotze. </p>\n\n<p>{<em>brachos 52a+b</em>}</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>So, my guess:</p>\n\n<p>With a dry measure, there is probably no concern that the dry-flower will become tammeh through contact with the dry-outside of the measure, and the overflow of flour also wouldn't transfer tummah to your hand. However, a wet measure would need to be anointed inside and out to prevent this kind of transfer of tummah through wet-contact with the tammeh-interior or exterior of the measure.</p>\n\n<p>(Also, I don't know if the measures had handles, but a handle can't become tammeh, only the inside and outside surfaces.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>אח״כ מצאתי...‏</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0914131990\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>An Illustrated Guide to Korbonos and Menochos</em></a> (by Rabbi Sinai Malowicki, 1st edition, Torah Umesorah Publications, 1991, ISBN 0-914131-99-0) says passim (i.e., about each type of <em>mincha</em>) \"The flour is poured into a holy dish which measures exactly one עִשָּׂרוֹן\".

Here, the term \"Shituf\" is used interchangeably for the business-parntership (שותף) and the oath a non-Jew makes to a partner of Hashem (משותף): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sanhedrin 63b, </p>\n  \n  <p><em>\"One must not form a Shotef [business partnership] [with a non-Jew]\"</em> </p>\n  \n  <p>...\n  \"Even\n  though they associate (shituf) God's name with \"something else\", we do\n  not find that it is forbidden to cause others to associate (shituf)\"\n  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shituf#Medieval_Jewish_views\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia's translation</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if we want to know what amount of co-mingling is considered \"Shituf\" or \"sharing\" when we apply it to Hashem, then I think we can accurately define Shituf by looking how the Talmud  identifies what percentage of sharing-ownership (Shotef) of a first-born-calf  with a non-Jew is enough of a percentage to render the first-born-calf unnecessary to be redeem.</p>\n\n<p>Bechoros 2b and Sanhedrin 63b use the same quote from \"The Father of Samuel\".

Whether Hashem is 99.99% God and another entity shares .01%, or if Hashem has .01% and the other entity is 99.99% God, or anything between there (has a hand in the middle). \n(ie. anything that violates \"Hashem is one\")</p>\n\n<p><em>Avodah Zarah</em>, on the other hand takes the next step of either making a physical representation to worship and emparting powers on something physical (eg. image, stone, wood, nature, bones), or saying Hashem isn't God at all, something else is (spiritually or physically).  (ie. anything that violates \"Hashem is God\")</p>\n\n<p>(or any of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912348/jewish/Avodah-Kochavim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">these</a> practices of people who worship Avodah Zarah)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Anything above on Sanhedrin 63b.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Views of Shituf is a machlochet (dissagreement) of the rishonim.  I'm not sure what all the views are. However, I do know what the most extreme view on one side is the Rambam who basically argues that anything you say about G-d that is a possitive statement is shituf (known as negetive theology). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology</a></p>\n\n<p>In the Hakira journal the topic was tangentially touched upon with a debate regarding if Rashi held that Gd had a body.  <a href=\"http://hakirah.org/Vol%207%20Slifkin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">See R' Natan Slifkin's essay in Hakira here</a> and <a href=\"http://scribd.com/doc/17746241/Thoughts-on-Was-Rashi-a-Corporealist\" rel=\"nofollow\">a response by Levi Notik here</a>. </p>\n\n\n",

Working on the Sabbath is also theoretically punishable by stoning, yet the Sabbath <em>must</em> be violated to save a life (whereas you can't murder someone to save a life). Similarly, Judaism allows the bystander to use lethal force if necessary to prevent an attempted rape or murder; but the bystander has no business using force to prevent consenting adults from doing whatever they want. (See Rambam, Laws of the Murderer & Preservation of Life, 1:10--11).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Although one might think to conclude that homosexuality is worse than murder based on the specific punishments court can impose upon them (stoning for homosexuality and decapitation for murder), this simplistic understanding is not borne out upon further investigation. I know I shouldn't just quote on this site, but no one says it better than the Rambam himself:</p>\n<p>(my translation of <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/b504.htm#11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 4:8-9</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>8: One who kills someone and there were not two witnesses who saw it together, rather they saw him individually, or alternatively he killed without being given warning, or the witnesses failed the interrogatory checks of the court: all these murderers are placed in a room and fed plain bread and water until their stomachs shrink whereupon they are fed barley until their stomachs break and they die.</p>\n<p>9: We do not do this to the rest of those obligated in the death penalty. Rather, if they are obligated in the death penalty -- they are killed, and if not -- not. For even if there are sins which have stricter punishments than murder, they do not have the aspect of the destruction of society [lit: world] like murder. Even idolatry and illicit sexual relationships and the desecration of the Sabbath are not like murder for they are between man and God; murder, however, is between man and his fellow man. Anyone who has this sin in his hands is Definitely Evil. Even all the mitzvot he did his whole life will not counterbalance this sin to save him from punishment...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Consider also the Rambam in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/b501.htm#4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Rotzeach 1:4</a> (again my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4: ...And there is nothing the Torah was so particular about as much as murder, as it says (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0435.htm#33\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 35:33</a>): And do not pollute the land...for the [spilling of] blood will pollute the land...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud itself actually rejects the notion of working just with statutory punishments to determine \"worse\"-ness. In deriving the permission to violate Shabbat to save a life, the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=85&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 85a</a>) reasons (my summary): if one is allowed to murder a home-intruder (which is such a terrible sin that it defiles the land and causes the Shekhina to depart from the Jewish people) because he might kill someone, all the more so you can violate Shabbat (which isn't as strict) because of the possibility of potential death.</p>\n<p>It is clear from here that the Talmud views murder as \"worse\" than violating Shabbat, even though the former's punishment is decapitation (roughly, the \"3rd-to-most severe\" form of capital punishment) while the latter's is stoning (roughly, the \"most severe\" form of capital punishment).</p>\n<p>So it seems the sign holder didn't really know what he was talking about.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's is not so simple to compare sins or to measure which is worse than what, they are both very terrible, you shouldn't do any of both.</p>\n\n<p>anyone saying that it is or isn't should prove it.

There is an element of cruelty, and the ultimate benefit is probably more for the exhausted parents than for the child.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As I see it, this question must be divided into two separate issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How does standing by while another person is in pain affect you, your soul and middot?</li>\n<li>How does the Jewish tradition view allowing a child to CIO (Cry It Out) from the perspective of the child? ie. Does anyone discuss how this activity may affect the child in the long run?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let's start with Issue #2, as it seems to be more at the core of your questions:</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, no traditional Torah sources discuss this particular issue of letting a child cry it out for the purpose of \"training\" the child to sleep. I don't believe this to be a function of \"the Torah opinion\" taking sides on the issue of whether or not sleep training has a negative effect on a child's development, it is more likely a function of the fact that the concept of sleep training was only introduced in the late 1800s and was only popularized in the subsequent decades. </p>\n\n<p>If it is indeed true that \"sleep training\" a child improves their self-esteem, intelligence and trust in their parents (and by extension God), then I think we can all certainly agree that Judaism would not take issue with, or perhaps even encourage, such a regimen. However, being that there is conflicting evidence, leaving the answer unclear, we should probably act as we would with any <em>safek</em> (doubt in Jewish law), and stand on the <em>chazaka</em> (status quo), until there is substantial evidence to uproot this status quo (the status quo is probably, as my wife points out, somewhere in between the two methods, parents making decisions based on their child's needs using their intuition and parenting style).</p>\n\n<p>Decisions such as these should be made based on a parenting style, which Torah sources do comment on. For example, one piece of Torah advice that comes to mind is, \"have the left hand push away and the right hand draw near\" (Sanhedrin 107b <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=107b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=107b&format=pdf</a> 5 lines above the start of the mishna in the middle of the line and Sotah 47a), meaning that we should have balance in our parenting, both showing love and being firm. Of course, the \"pushing away\" is done with the left, weaker, hand. For more on the Torah's views on parenting, I would strongly recommend <em>Zriyah U'Binyan B'Chinuch</em> by Rav Wolbe, which is available in both <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/authors/wolbe-rabbi-shlomo/z-ria-u-binyan-b-chinuch-hebrew-only.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hebrew</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/planting-and-building-in-education.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">English</a> from Feldhiem Publishers and <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1583304029\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, onto Issue #1:</p>\n\n<p>Based on the sources listed in the above mentioned article (stories of Mittler Rebbe, Rabbi Yisroel Salanter as well as the undocumented halachic sources) and other sources (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0319.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0319.htm#16</a>, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/g1123SvR5F8?t=4m20s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://youtu.be/g1123SvR5F8?t=4m20s</a>, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2821.htm#13\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2821.htm#13</a>) it seems clear that it would be detrimental to one's middos/soul/personal growth to stand idly by while a fellow human being, particularly a child is in pain/crying. \nIn certain situations (particularly as parents), however, we must do things which are detrimental to ourselves if they benefit others and therefore if sleep training is shown to be beneficial to our children then we may have to forgo our personal growth for the growth of our children. Being that (as outlined above) this is still in the realm of <em>safek</em> (doubt) we would not be obligated to forgo our personal growth by standing idly by as a child cries unless it is abundantly clear that this would benefit the child in the long-term.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All in all, I think the question you are asking is \"Does the Torah/Judaism take sides on the 'sleep debate'?\" and the answer is most certainly not. This is scientific question and we must act, as always, according to the facts that we have (or don't) based on the principles of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rabbi Noach Orlowek in his book on parenting, My Child My Disciple, says that it is forbidden to let a child cry, because it will affect his Emunah - he will learn that no one answers you when you cry.</p>\n\n<p>In a private conversation (which will remain private by leaving out information), the Mashgiach of a well-known Yeshiva, upon hearing this, said \"When my son was crying every night at 2 in the morning, I wasn't trying to decide <em>if</em> I should throw him out the window, but how best to go about doing it.  So I don't think it's such a practical debate.\"  By which he meant (on further clarification), for the sake of all parties involved just do whatever works best.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This article from AMI magazine goes through the pros and cons of the Ferber method. <a href=\"http://www.batyathebabycoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Ami-Magazine-Article.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.batyathebabycoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Ami-Magazine-Article.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n",

That being the case, how does the concept of \"eilu v'eilu divrei elokim chaim\" (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=13b&format=pdf\">Eruvin 13b</a>) work out? When two scholars argue, how can they both be right?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>A simple parable for this idea is the idea of projection. If one looks at a cylinder, for example, it could be a square or a circle. In reality, it is both or neither. </p>\n\n<p>Torah, in principle, is higher than human understanding. Therefore, as the Torah comes into human understanding it gets \"filtered\" through their brain (even two prophets would not use the same wording). Therefore, if someone applies the Torah approach to a problem and gets to one resolution, the result is true.</p>\n\n<p>However, practically, as it comes into the world, there can be only one truth, which is known as \"Halacha\". Therefore, when one asks a shaila, he is expecting \"what to do\", not \"there are two approaches\" because this world, a physical world, is limited in the sense that one cannot do two opposite things at a time. Therefore, the halacha could go like either one or the other, and halachically, the other could be rejected completely, as if it wasn't there (Beis Shamai v Beis Hillel). In the source of Halacha, in the higher worlds, however, they are both true.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There are certainly absolute truths in regard to things that are known or things that are fundamental principles - it is absolutely true that HaShem created the universe and redeemed the Israelites from Egypt, for example.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to things that are really unknowable, the best we can do is base our understanding of them on sound principles handed down to us from Sinai.  </p>\n\n<p>One subset of unknowable things is, ironically, Halachah.  What I mean by that is that we cannot know with absolute certainty (ie., we cannot know the absolute truth about) what HaShem wants us to do in any given situation.  </p>\n\n<p>Certain things are easier to determine than others - we can know that lighting a camp fire on Shabbath is prohibited.  That is explicitly forbidden by the Torah.  What about operating an electric wheelchair?  That would depend on the definition of certain types of Melachah and the design of the wheelchair, and whether or not the neighborhood is in a public domain.  Depending on the situation, and also depending on the analysis of the applicable laws, one Posek can reach a different conclusion than another.  </p>\n\n<p>The same is true for things that we would like to know outside the realm of laws.  What happens to us when we die?  What do certain esoteric verses mean when they describe the Heavenly Court?  We cannot know these things for certain.  Because of that we have to rely on the Sinaitic principles that we have, and different scholars can reach different conclusions based on the limited knowledge that we do have (verses, primarily, as well as earlier scholars' analyses of the same subject).</p>\n\n<p>That is Eilu VeEilu in a nutshell.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are many different interpretations of \"Elu V'Elu\". It is rather difficult to say that it literally means both sides of an argument can be true, since it is applied to disputes of facts. E.g. what were the events of a story, or what did so-and-so hold. They cannot both be literally true, since they were events that actually happened. </p>\n\n<p>A more likely explanation is that \"Elu V'elu\" means both sides are legitimate interpretations. While only one of them may in fact be true, at the time of the dispute it is not possible to prove one side wrong. And one cannot ask God, since \"Lo B'shamayim He\" (The Torah is no longer in heaven, it has been given over to man to interpret). Since we cannot prove which side is right, a person can learn both sides without worrying that one of them is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Absolute truth exists, but in certain areas of dispute it is not possible to find it. So both sides are considered the word of God. </p>\n\n\n",

There are too many stories of non-Jewish women marrying Jewish men with no indication of conversion or statements saying that the children will not be Jewish in tanach.

I am not interested in explanations of 'really, it was always this way'</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>As I heard it from a Rabbi Frand tape, and similarly in a shiur from Rabbi Breitowitz:</p>\n\n<p>The question is also raised with regards to Mahlon & Kilyon marrying \"Moabite women\" in Ruth Chapter 1. If they weren't Jewish, how could they have married them? If they converted, why do we derive the necessary commitment for a convert from what Ruth says <em>after</em> she married Mahlon?</p>\n\n<p>Two answers are given:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Post Sinai, conversion was always necessary. The sincerity of various conversions was called into question, and Ruth's commitment after-the-fact proves that she really meant it. Her sister-in-law (-in-law) Orpah walked away when Judaism was no longer convenient, which proves her conversion wasn't real. Similarly, if Nach describes someone marrying a \"gentile\" woman, that's because she went through the motions of a conversion, but we now know looking back that the sincerity of the conversion was a sham.</li>\n<li>The Biblical prohibition on intermarriage applied only to the Canaanite nations, or to acts performed \"in public\" (as Zimri did). Marrying women from other non-Jewish peoples, if done someplace where no Jews were around, was only prohibited later (I believe this is attributed to the Hasmoneans). Yes, this means the children would not be Jewish. So it was not actually prohibited for Mahlon, living deep out in Moabite-land, to marry Ruth. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there are three time periods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-Sinai: different determination of \"who is a Jew?\"</li>\n<li>Sinai to Hasmonean: same \"who is a Jew\" as today, but intermarriage allowed in some cases</li>\n<li>Post-Hasmonean: same system as today; Judaism defined by matrilineal descent or sincere conversion; all intermarriage prohibited</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

He started a Yeshibha based on the Ashkenaz model, married his sons, exclusively, to members of his own extended family (although he did marry his daughters to Sephardim, probably students at his Yeshibha..).</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting thing to point out is that the Rosh brough the concept of self-martyrdom from Ashkenaz (of Crusader infamy) to Sefarad; during the anti-Jewish riots in Seville in 1391, his great-grandson Jacob ben Asher II took his own life and that of his family, rather than submit to the cross. </p>\n\n<p>That horrific act elicited both horror and admiration from various quarters of the Sephardic community.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting thing to observe about the Rosh; you of course already mentioned his description of differences in custom. Yet never does the Rosh say a word about pronunciation. It seems, in fact, that the differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic (Western European) pronunciation of Hebrew was a later development. How and why that came about is for a different discussion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>{PREAMBLE}</p>\n\n<p>It is historically true that Rabbeinu Asher was from Germany (Ashkenaz) and moved to Spain (Sepharad) in the early 1300s and carried the tradition of the Ba'alei Tosafoth with him.  However, the timeline of the Ashkenazi/Sepharadi split is unclear.  There are clear lines of separation dating back at least 1,000 years, this much is true.  However, the Geonic period didn't truly end until midway through the 11th Century, well after Rabbeinu Gershom, widely regarded as the first Ashkenazi Rishon, had gained prominence and began issuing decrees that were followed only by Ashkenazim and not Sepahradim (including a ban on polygamy).</p>\n\n<p>That is to say that, while there was already a split geographically, the development into two prominent schools of religious thought was only just beginning in the 11th Century, or less than 300 years before Rabbeinu Asher gained prominence, and this may have been largely due to geography more than anything ideological.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the RaShB\"A essentially vouched for him and made him the de facto chief rabbi of Spain kind of demonstrates that at that stage, any split was one that the leaders didn't much like.</p>\n\n<p>{ANSWER}</p>\n\n<p>One thing I know he wrote about was surprise that Spanish Jews had assumed authority from the government to enforce capital punishment, although they apparently used this authority to prevent capital punishment, which is something he continued to endorse.</p>\n\n<p>He also opposed secular learning, which he felt negatively influenced Torah study, and which was common in Spain.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Joseph Soloveichik famously observed that a Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri had prohibited rice in the Talmud; thus the custom has at least some minority Talmudic opinion on which to hang its hook (even though for entirely different reasons). </p>\n\n<p>The custom against <em>kitniyot</em> is codified as Ashkenazic practice by Rabbi Moshe Issreles in his comments on the Shulchan Aruch (c. 1550).</p>\n\n<p>As it has become established custom, it is now binding on Ashkenazic Jews, barring rare circumstances (someone could ask their rabbi for a waiver if they have severe dietary restrictions; in times of severe scarceness, some communities' rabbinic leadership would allow some forms of <em>kitniyot</em> that year). Rabbi Danczig, writing in the <em>Chayei Adam</em> right about 1800, explains that it was not instituted top-down by rabbinic leadership (in which case it would warrant the Mosaic prohibition \"do not deviate from what your judges state, left or right\"), but something that happened bottom-up, in a softer, more organic fashion, and has now been fixed. He applies the opening verse of Proverbs, \"don't reject the teachings of your mother.\" Around the year 1900, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein of Novardok (in <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>) wrote that \"those Ashkenazic Jews who fail to keep <em>kitniyot</em> today, it is clear that they lack all fear of Heaven.\"</p>\n\n<p>We view standardized custom as something very strong and not something that should be tinkered with. We don't think we're so smart that 800 years of Jewish history can just be thrown out the door; some caution and humility are in order.</p>\n\n<p>There are, however, a few loopholes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The custom clearly never applied to Sephardic Jews. There are different opinions regarding whether you can observe the Sephardic custom if you move to a Sephardic place (with Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef shlit'a of the opinion that the entire Israel is \"a Sephardic place\" and thus the lenient custom prevails there; this argument would effectively do away with Ashkenazic custom wholesale), or according to some, even if you're visiting a Sephardic home. There are also Jews who have changed over their entire set of customs <strong>consistently</strong> to a different community's; please, consult your rabbi first.</li>\n<li>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's opinion was that <em>kitniyot</em> only covers those legumes/semigrains explicitly banned at some point in time (some back in the 1200s, others later, as evidenced by New-World crops such as corn being on the list). If it hasn't been banned yet, it's not prohibited (unless you want to go make a ban on it now, and he suspects that rabbis stopped adding to the prohibited list at some point to make sure there were enough edible substances remaining! This is Rabbi Feinstein projecting his considerate, nuanced method of <em>psak</em>, by the way.) This approach has the added convenience of sparing you the mental gymnastics required to explain why various products did or didn't make the list -- the list happened as it happened over time.</li>\n<li>A body with the force of a <em>Sanhedrin</em> would certainly have the power to repeal this custom, and I have heard Ashkenazim grumble and hope that happens soon. The <em>Sanhedrin</em> recently established in Israel (using Rabbi Halbershtam as its nexus, as was done with Rabbi Beirav 500 years ago) is cautious not to overstep its boundaries so as not to be ignored entirely (many don't accept it as is), so I don't see them as doing this anytime soon. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As per Rav Moshe Feinstein's approach, that the prohibition to eat <em>kitniyos</em> is a <em>hanhagah shehinhugu chachamim</em>, a custom that the Rabbis guided their flocks to keep. It does not have the status of a <em>takannah</em>, a law instituted by court. All the more so is this true according to the Chayei Adam's approach mentioned by Shalom. </p>\n\n<p>Since it was based on a good reason it has the status of a <em>neder</em>, a vow to do good by not using these products on Passover. For such a vow that was taken on by one's ancestors for a <em>d'var mitzvah</em>, (to keep us further away from the possibility of eating <em>hametz</em>) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=50b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the law is that even if it is more difficult for us to keep it, we must because of the verse \"Shemah beni musar avichah ve'al titosh toras imecha\" \"... do not leave the guidance of your mother\" i.e. One must not deviate from the good guidance and customs that his ancestors accepted on themselves.</a> Being that an Ashkenazi must keep this custom however difficult it may be (except if endangering to life) it would appear unmovable even by a Sanhedrin. The only way to remove a vow is through finding an opening for regret, which is an impossible exercise if you did not make the vow to begin with. </p>\n\n<p>Those Ashkenazi gedolim who did not like the custom lived in times when it was either not unanimously accepted yet in the Ashkenazic world and they wished to keep it that way (some Rishonim), or it was recently accepted by a previous generation and the gadol was expressing frustration that he could not do away with it (Rav Yakov Emden).</p>\n\n\n",

What I've heard is the general recommendation against pants are because they tend to be more form-fitting than skirts. I know religious women who have been told, in various occupational settings, that loose pants are acceptable; again, talk to your rabbi.

Many years ago, Rav Goren was visiting the Gruss Kollel and he was asked about the basic kashrut level of rabbanut with regards to terumot uma'asrot. He said (back then) that all were recommended, except for Rabbanut Haifa, which was using a controversial loophole suggested by a young Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. I could also say that chicken & turkey tend to have less kashrut complications than beef, and that anything that says \"gelatin\" on the ingredients could be more complicated. Keep in mind that Hazal left certain leniencies for soldiers, so basic kosher may be good enough for you. Please make sure you're eating enough to stay healthy and do your job.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shabbat: training is a complicated question; many things if done in a strange way (such as dialing a telephone with the knuckle of your thumb) become less prohibited, if this works for your situation. As for anything operational, if your commanding officer says it's of vital importance, I heard Rabbi Herschel Welcher in Queens say that an army can't work if soldiers are constantly questioning their orders. I also heard a story from Rav Benny Lau about a soldier who had to write on shabbat, he wanted to write only the things he thought were important. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach told him, <em>al tachshov, tichtov.</em> \"Don't think, just write.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do Etrogs grow, pitom-up, or pitom-down?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've done a bit of research here, but I still have some questions. </p>\n\n<p>To start with, for anyone who isn't familiar with this, we can't say the brucha for lulav & etrog after completing the mitzvah, and the mitzvah is completed as soon as we gather the 4 species together and they are all right-side up, so we first pick up the Etrog upside-down, say the brucha and then turn it right-side up. </p>\n\n<p>For the Etrog, The Shulchan Aruch says right-side-up is the way it grows: pitom-up, (and we should first pick it up pitom-down). And I remember being taught as a kid the Etrog first grows pitom-up and then turns pitom-down.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand,\"The Second Jewish Book of Why\" (page 266-267) says,  etrogs grow pitom-down and growing pitom-up is a misconception that dates back to \"the German Authority Jacob ben Moses Mollin (1360-1427)\" who described the procedure in \"Minhagay Maharil\", and that it is an error in the Shulchan Aruch as well. It also cites that Rabbi Yechiel Epstein and Rabbi Israel Ben Meir Hakohen were aware that Etrogs grew pitom-down, but ruled it is a minhag (custom) now.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farm1.static.flickr.com/46/159806950_8c95ca7112_z.jpg?zz=1\" alt=\"adult etrog\"></p>\n\n<p>However, when I look at photos of etrogs, the young etrog-buds do grow pitom-up first, as opposed to how a kiwi immediately <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kiwifruit-Actinidia_deliciosa-plantation.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hangs down</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do Rabbi Yechiel Epstein (Aruch ha-Shulchan) and Rabbi Israel Ben Meir Hakohen (the Chafetz Chaim?) actually agree they don't grow this way?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does it matter at what growth-point the etrog is considered a fruit (<a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/orachchayim/chapter14.html?print=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unripe fruits are ha'adama, not ha'eitz</a>)? or what growth-point is an etrog kosher for use? Can an etrog be too small?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there other cases where we need to know the orientation of a fruit? \n-note: Willow branches grow facing down but we consider the \"top\" of the branch to be the the end of branch pointing towards the ground. Do we consider willow branches to also grow upwards first?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The origin of this halachah is on Succah 45b where Chezkiah says in the name of R' Yermiah in the name of R' Shimon bar Yochai that we learn from the pasuk \"Atzei Shittim Omdim\" ('Acacia wood standing' there is an apparently extra word 'standing') That for every mitzvah in the Torah a man does not fulfill them except in the way that they grow. Rashi explains that this means that the part that comes from the bottom goes down and the part that goes up is on top.</p>\n\n<p>The stem of the plant, the part that is attached to the tree, is the part that leads toward the ground, whichever way that particular fruit or branch grows on the tree.  So, for example, when you hold the arbah minim the parts of the esrog, lulav, haddasim and aravaos that are attached to the tree are the parts we hold down.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Species\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Species</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The 4 species must be placed in the direction in which they grew. (For\n  the etrog, this means that the stem end should be on the bottom and\n  the blossom end on top; <strong>this is the direction in which the etrog\n  begins to grow</strong>, though as it matures on the tree it usually hangs in\n  the opposite direction.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Along similar lines, many people here include in answers about Jewish practice a recommendation that the reader consult their own Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>What is the reason for this concern?</p>\n\n<p>Why is it so important to speak, in particular, to a Rabbi (and especially to \"your local\" one)?</p>\n\n<p>What would be so wrong with simply using good-looking information from a site like this one that we need disclaimers all over the place and constant warnings?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 81)\n\n<p>We are concerned with being the cause of somebody else erring.  Parshat Kedoshim tells us \"do not place a stumbling-block before the blind\", which is interpreted to mean not only what it plainly says but also \"don't be an enabler for a bad outcome\".  Causing somebody else to unknowingly transgress what God wants us to do is a pretty serious \"bad outcome\".</p>\n\n<p>In order to become a rabbi one must study halacha and the sources that inform it in depth.  Non-rabbis can also be serious scholars and I wouldn't write off a lay person who is, but most people don't know one.</p>\n\n<p>As for \"local\", I think this is shorthand for \"consult someone who will be <em>your</em> rabbi\".  Pirke Avot tells us \"make for yourself a rav\"; this is because most questions are not so clear-cut, and individual circumstances can bear on the answer.  The rav needs to know not only the specific question but what is causing you to ask it.  For example (and I'm just making this up here; I am not a posek etc), if you ask the generic question \"can I go to a church service?\" the answer is generally going to be \"no\".  If you ask \"can I go to the wedding of the sibling I've just recently reconciled with, who is marrying out, but not showing up could undo that reconcilliation?\", the answer might be different.  Your rav should be someone who knows you and ideally you should be having these conversations face-to-face, hence \"local\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 38)\n\n<p>Here are a few, off the top of my head:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Often there are factors that you may not think are relevant when asking your question, but could certainly be. You may have looked up some kosher-kitchen question about vegetables, not knowing that onions have very different laws than potatoes.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are plenty of gray areas in halacha where the conclusion may be something like \"it's best not to do such-and-such, but it's allowable in cases of great need\"; if every Tom, Dick, and Harry would go around deciding for themselves what's <em>great need</em>, X% of the population will (wrongly) do it all the time, and Y% will (wrongly) refrain even when it's life-and-death. </p></li>\n<li><p>Someone other than yourself may be the best judge of the situation. You may say \"it's not a great need\", but a good rabbi may hear the anxiety in your voice that implies otherwise. Or the question may involve other human factors, where knowledge of the people involved is important.</p></li>\n<li><p>It provides a good \"checkup opportunity\" for all sorts of related issues. If a married couple brings a personal question to their rabbi, he can see if the interactions between them look healthy. If a man needs to shed his yarmulka or eat fruit at a non-kosher restaurant because of his job, it's important to make sure he isn't feeling alienated from Judaism.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 29)\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A Rabbi is an expert in his field and has studied for many years.</strong> If one needed medical advice, G-d forbid, they would never rely on \"crowd-sourced\" opinions of a question and answer website, but would go to a trained doctor with practical experience. If this is so with regards physical healing, how much more so when dealing with the health of one's souls.</li>\n<li><strong>A Rabbi is aware of personal circumstances.</strong> A Halachic ruling can differ depending on who it is for. For example, a case of הפסד מרובה would be different for a rich person and a poor person, and is up to the discretion of the Rabbi to determine. The answer may differ depending on the local community custom (Sefardi, Ashkenazi, Chassidish, Litvish etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>A Rabbi will answer the question with wisdom.</strong> It is not always enough for a Rabbi to be \"book smart\", but also needs to answer his questions wisely. For example, a non-religious couple in Russia had a son who was not healthy enough to have his bris on time. When he was one month old an argument ensued whether they could have a Pidyon Haben before the bris. The grandfather, a learned Torah scholar adamantly insisted that the bris should be done first, but his opinion was disregarded by the other Rabbis. The boy never ended up having a bris, and the grandfather later explained that he knew that the parents would only perform one religious ceremony for the baby, and that was why he wanted that to be the bris. There is often more to what a Rav rules than what is written in Shulchan Aruch.</li>\n<li><strong>A  Rabbi has Yiras Shomayim.</strong> The very knowlege that a Jew will observe his ruling practically will cause the Rav to make a concerted effort that his ruling is sound and unbiased. (See Hayom Yom for 23 Adar II).</li>\n<li><strong>A Rabbi has Siyata Dishmaya - Divine Assistance.</strong> The Gemora in Sanhedrin (93b) says regarding Dovid Hamelech \"וה' עמו - שהלכה כמותו\"; \"Hashem was with him\" means that Halacha always favored his opinion. This shows that a correct legal decision requires not only astute reasoning but also Yiras Shomayim. One who possesses such Yiras Shomayim is granted Divine assistance that his ruling should not cause others to err. The Lubavitcher Rebbe related the story of the Nodah Beyehuda who was appointed Chief Rabbi of Prauge at the young age of 42. Some felt he was not senior enough for the position and attempted to undermine his knowledge by presenting him with obscure Halachic questions but were unable to stump him. Finally someone asked him a question that he answered incorrectly and then proceeded to disprove the Nodah Beyehuda. The Noda Beyehuda replied: This question was obviously not Halacha Lemayse - a practical question, for if so I would have had Siyata Dishmaya to answer it correctly (Sicha from day of Simchas Torah 5736, par. 4).</li>\n<li><strong>A Rabbi has the power of Torah to affect the physical existence.</strong>  The Gemora Yerushalmi brings a case were a girl lost her virginity after she turned three. Later, the Beis Din determined that that year should be a leap year and retroactively she was not yet three years old at the time. This Halachic ruling influences her physical body that her virginity will grow back. This unique power to create a \"Psak Din\" that establishes fact is given only to Rabbonim. The Chasam Sofer (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=794&pgnum=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O\"C Siman 14</a>) explains this in quite unambiguous terms that the nature of the world is subservient and influenced by the Torah. This is brought Lehalcha regarding Hilchos Vestos in Siman 189 Shach 13. For this reason the Lubavitcher Rebbe often asked Rabbonim to issue a Psak Din that Moshiach must come now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Source</strong>: Many of the above ideas are from on the Sefer \"13 Principles of Faith\" (Gutnick Edition) by Rabbi Chaim Miller based on the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Principle Eight Lesson Three.</em></p>\n\n\n",

Ashkenazic Jewry basically descends from the Italian communities of the early Middle Ages, and some historians trace them and their traditions back to the Jews of Eretz Yisrael (as contrasted with the Sephardim, who derive their traditions from the Jews of Babylonia). But the ancient Jewish communities of Eretz Yisrael were basically wiped out by the Crusaders, and the Jews who resettled it were largely Sephardim, especially after the expulsion from Spain. Hence the similarities between Spain and Israel.</p>\n\n<p>(Something similar happened with France as well. Its old Ashkenazic communities were dispersed during the expulsions of the 14th century; the reconstituted communities of the 17th and 18th centuries were again mostly Ashkenazic, but most of them were lost to assimilation, and the rest were destroyed during the Holocaust; the bulk of present-day French Jews are Sephardim from North Africa.)</p>\n\n<p>That said, there has been a fair amount of cross-fertilization too. You mention the Spanish Reconquista in your comment, and that indeed was part of what made it possible for Ashkenazic styles of learning (such as the methods of Tosafos) to enter Spain, and conversely, for Spanish influences (such as piyut) to travel north. Even earlier than that, though, the French Rabbeinu Gershom studied (directly or indirectly) under R. Hai Gaon of Babylonia, and conversely, the Italian \"<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111839/jewish/The-Four-Captives.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Four Captives</a>\" taught in Spain and other countries under Babylonian influence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The relationship between Sepharadim in Spain or Morrocco and those in Iraq (which is, as you say, a long distance) has a lot to do with the fact that when the Jews were kicked out of Spain in 1492, they traveled all over the Mediterranean, reaching North Africa, Israel, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. From Israel they migrated to places like Syria and Iraq. Additionally all of these lands were a part of the Ottoman Empire, so there was a lot of freedom to travel without crossing borders.</p>\n\n<p>The rabbis coming from Spain were very frequently greater scholars than any pre-existing <em>mustarabim</em> (Jews indigenous to these Arab countries) in these countries, and so their minhagim took over.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, one can find quite a bit of variation in psak between different Sephardic communities today, moreso than among (non-Chassidic) Ashkenazim. A large part of the reason for this is because of the way the Ashkenazic community rebuilt and reorganized itself after the Holocaust in the United States and in Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud at Sanhedrin 105a says that the righteous of all nations shall have a place in the world to come.  The question is \"who is righteous?\"  As noted, a gentile who keeps the <a href=\"http://www.milechai.com/judaism/bnai-noach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">seven Noachide laws</a> in all of their details is said to have attained the level of righteousness of the High Priest in Temple times.  Baba Kamma 38a.  Maimonides (the \"Rambam\") at Hilchot Melakim 8:11 confirmed that a gentile fully-observant of the Noachide laws has a place in the world to come.</p>\n\n<p>If by \"unbelievers\" you are referring to apostate, atheistic, or agnostic Jews, then the answer is \"it depends.\"  If the person is an atheist or agnostic because he's never had an introduction to Judaism or knows what the commandments are, much less how to observe them, he could not be judged guilty for violating laws he did not know.  On the other hand, someone who is especially sinful, and more so, one who causes others to sin, e.g. an adulterer or one who embarrasses others, according to some views, are doomed in Gehinnom forever.  Baba Metzia 58b.  </p>\n\n<p>Another view, that of Hillel, is that (as Shalom noted) that the worst of sinners will suffer in Gehinnom for 12 months and then their souls will be destroyed into dust that will blanket Heaven and be walked upon by the righteous.  Rosh Hashana 17a.  Less aggregious sinners, however, will spend no more than 12 months in Gehinnom and then be raised up to Heaven. Ibid.  </p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is a view that eternal punishment exists for those who attack and defame Rabbinic Law.  It is said that they will be boiled in feces for eternity.  Gittin 57a.  Which of these views is correct, no one is sure.  The purpose of such speculation appears to be to motivate Jews towards certain behaviors rather than giving you a precise picture of what to expect.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are many different views on these matters. The Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim seems to take an original view that there is no such thing as hell. The righteous and wise will reach a level where their soul continues after death, but the wicked will cease to exist. The Rambam seems to hold that those who do not have the right beliefs will not be able to be continue to exist for eternity. On the other hand, if someone sinned but overall was righteous, then he should be able to acquire olam haba.  </p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51255&st=&pgnum=57\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">siman 40</a> he writes that Hashem made evil in order to use it as a vehicle for revealing His complete absoluteness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרע שברא הוא ית' להודיע אמתת יחודו ולנסות בו את האדם</p>\n<p>...the evil that He created in order to make known His true Oneness and to test man with it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I briefly discussed how this works <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36081/what-if-our-purpose-is-to-be-bad/36090#36090\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In this point, the Ramchal is arguing that the primary purpose of the existence of evil is <em>not</em> for the purpose of facilitating free-will, but rather for the purpose of completing the appreciation of Hashem's Oneness.  Evil, and the notion that there is a reality to something outside of Hashem's will, exist only to facilitate the revelation of Hashem's Oneness when evil is obliterated.</p>\n<p>Later (Siman 118), discussing the existence of bad things, e.g. suffering, he says evil was created in order to have a mechanism for punishing the wicked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונמצא כלל הרע, אשר הוא ית' השיב אחור ימינו מהנהגת עולמו, וינהגהו בכבדות, תוקף חשך סתרו, ושם בטבע הלז כל הפסדי הטוב, הלא המה כל מדות בית דין, להביא במשפט על כל נעלם ורשעים</p>\n<p>(Paraphrased) Evil was created to bring punishment upon the evildoers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Evil in this context means the existence of negative things.  If Hashem is completely good and bad is an \"external\" creation (siman 104), the existence of negativity needs to be explained.</p>\n<p>As for the Evil Inclination, Da'as Tevunos cites the Zohar (Siman 78):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאמרם ז\"ל (זוהר ח\"א, קו ע\"ב), לא נברא יצה\"ר אלא לנסות בו את בני האדם\"</p>\n<p>The Evil Inclination was only created to test man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For instance, the word standing could literally mean a physical body standing-up or it can metaphorically mean everlasting (standing for eternity).</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam explains how every one of the \"physical\" characteristics, as they relate to God, are equivocal terms like 'standing', and he brings many other passages as proof that the words are used in those other metaphorical and non-physical ways. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Rambam also explains that the Torah passage \"Hear, O Israel, Hashem is our God, Hashem is One\" has a deep meaning that expresses God's incorporeality. </p>\n\n<p>For something to exist physically, it necessarily follows that there can be two or more of it (i.e. two apples, three quarks, a trillion stars). By saying God is one, we are denying that there can be any multiplicity of God, meaning he can't be physically manifested. As soon as God would take physical form, it would be possible for him to be two or more, but since he is completely non-corporeal, we say he is \"One\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p>To add to Shalom's answer, the word Elohim is not only used to mean G-d.

The Sefer HaIkarim, on the other hand, quoted in Sefer HaBrit (1-3, 4), is of the opinion that there is no life on the stars and planets. The Sefer HaBrit himself argues, and agrees with Rabbi Chisdai. Similarly, the Chidah in Petach Einayim (on Tosafot, Menachot, 37a) is of the opinion that such life does exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/22063\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link to the Ohr Hashem</a>. According to the article by Aryeh Kaplan brought <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9197/does-the-torah-discuss-aliens/9204#9204\">Adam's answer</a>, it is <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22063&st=&pgnum=401\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ma'amar 4, Drush 2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40655&st=&pgnum=219\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link to the Chidah</a>, (but he seems to be discussing two-headed sub-terrestrial human life.)</p>\n\n<p>Here is the Sefer Habrit <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43670&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Part 1, Ma'amar 3, Chapter 4)</a>. Please learn it, since I'm not sure I understood it correctly, but it appears he says that while life may exist, it will not be life we are familiar with. This is because the conditions are different there than they are here on earth. He compares this to sea-life. The Talmud says that everything that exists on dry land exists in the sea as well, but they are not exactly the same form. The ones in the sea may parallel the ones on dry land, but they're different because they live in a different environment. </p>\n\n<p>He continues that it is impossible that there will be human-like aliens with free will, although they might have intellectual capabilities. According to Torah, only man was created with free will, not any creature lower (e.g. animals) or higher (e.g. angels) than  him. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112878/jewish/Aviation-and-Space.htm#112887\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112878/jewish/Aviation-and-Space.htm#112887\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.interinclusion.org/inspirations/suspected-alien-life/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) said that “One who declares that there is no life besides on earth is limiting the Creator’s abilities.” And encouraged Professor Velvel Green to continue his work in this area. </p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe maintains that while life may exist on other planets, intelligent extraterrestrial beings with free choice do not exist. He appears to be differentiating between the capacity for intellect (a single trait) and an intelligent life form (the whole human package). [This may also be a result of a less than perfect translation]</p>\n\n<p>Much like there are animals that can do things that are considered to be human traits, such as speak and use tools, so too there are non-human beings that have intellectual capacities. It is even possible that these non-human beings can surpass human capabilities. Angels, for example, have more intellectual capacities than humans (Maimonides Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah 3:9). However, free choice is a uniquely human capability that sets us apart from the the rest of creation. Free choice, according to Torah, is defining quality of intelligent life. </p>\n\n<p>Free choice is only possible because G-d gave us the Torah. Without free choice, observing Torah and Mitzvot would be a sham. Therefore, when G-d gave us commandments, he gave with it the ability to truly choose whether to do them or not. It is because of the Torah that we have free choice. Since the Torah was only given to the Jewish people here on earth, we must say that any extra-terrestrial being does not have free will. </p>\n\n<p>Civilized Societies are created by intelligent being with free choice. If aliens don't have free choice, they would not have civilizations.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3012/jewish/Is-There-Life-on-Other-Planets.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for a summmary of the Lubavitcher Rebbe's view by Tzvi Freeman.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>To answer your question clearly,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Although the Pentateuch does not seem to make any mention of extraterrestrial life, some places in Nevi'im and Ketuvim may be understood to be making reference to Extraterrestrial life.

Generally, with teens the issues fall into 1 of 3 categories and sometimes a mixture of the 3:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>No understanding of the depth/basic meaning of the liturgy (ie. no issues with the concept of talking to God or praying, but an issue with the codified liturgy)</li>\n<li>Deeper <em>emunah</em> issues (eg. an issue with the concept of a personal God, God in general or God caring about them)</li>\n<li>Lack of inspiration</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you have an understanding of which issue (or mixture thereof) is affecting the particular teen you are dealing with you can begin to craft a plan to counter it. Usually the most effective methods involve one-on-one learning and conversations with the teen to address and go through the issues, but don't expect them to understand what issues are actually at the core of their lack of interest, you need to extrapolate this from the conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://www.ncsy.org/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\">NCSY</a> runs Tefilla (and many other Jewish learning) programs for teens in various cities across the US and Canada which have proven successful with many different teen demographics. I would recommend trying to connect the teen with their local chapter of NCSY.</p>\n\n<p>For teens living in areas with no active NCSY chapter or for teens who are not <em>matim</em> for NCSY's programs, I would recommend employing the methods listed above and finding a positive peer group with whom the teen can associate who are actively involved in improving their <em>tefillah</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Talk to them.</p>\n\n<p>As an ex Teen who once had no interest in Davening, I can speak from experience here.  Most attempts to get me to Daven backfired.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Find out why they aren't davening.</li>\n<li>Find out what they think davening is.  Is it different than what you understand it to be?  What do they think it is, what do they wish it was?</li>\n<li>I suggest getting a copy of <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0940118106\">\"Call to the Infinite</a>\" its an unfished book by R. Kaplan.  What I find great about it, is that its a huge collection about all the sources regarding why we pray, and different ways of davening.  It has no 'narration' or 'explanation' just sources in english.  It's a great spring board to help the teen figure out what they do and do not like about Davening.</li>\n<li>Allow for self exploration.  If the motivation doesn't come from within, it just builds resentment.</li>\n<li>Start them slow.  See if they are willing to try to do the bare minimum in davening.  Perhaps all they need is more focused concentration on what they are saying, which can be hard to achieve if you are rushing to say every single word.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Invite him over, show them through joyful song bit by bit how davening is precious. And most of all be a living example as teens look for hypocrisy with a magnifying glass.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# ribis and foreign currency conversion\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am afraid that I have only recently started to study this kind of thing and I completely unlearned compared to most of the contributors here, so I apologize if my question is somewhat unsophisticated.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a Jewish person who grew up in the UK, but lives in the US. Suppose that an old friend of his (who is Jewish), living in the UK, asks him for a loan. If everyone still lived in the UK it would be easy: the loan would be for a fixed number of British pounds, with no interest. And if everyone lived in the US, it would be easy: a fixed number of US dollars, with no interest. But here the lender and borrower live in different countries, with different currencies. If the loan is made in dollars, and the dollar appreciates, then the borrower will end up paying more back (in pounds, the currency they use every day) than they borrowed, which looks like ribis. But if the loan is made in pounds, and the dollar depreciates, then the lender will end up receiving back more in dollars (the currency <em>they</em> use every day) than they lent, which also looks like ribis.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some simple rule like 'work in the lender's currency'? Or something more complicated? Or is such a transaction such as this simply impossible? (The latter would be sad, given the positive commandment to lend money to those in need of it.)</p>\n\n<p>I know that the relevant standard is meant to be monetary value, but I don't see how to apply that here since there are two relevant notions of money.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\nA quick point of clarification: it's hard to give a good clear answer to the question 'in which country would the loan be made'. The lender lives in the US, and would probably just instruct his bank in the US to do a bank transfer to the UK. The borrower lives in the UK, and would just receive the bank transfer. Returning the money would work in a similar way. So each person would always just be staying in their own country.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/ou/print_this/64160\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ou.org/ou/print_this/64160</a></p>\n\n<p>The issue is that foreign currency is not called \"currency\" in another country because it is not commonly used there. </p>\n\n<p>There are two opinions of what is the law if a loan took place in one country, and expecting to be payed back in another country.\nAccording to the Nsivos Sholom (162:1), one could pay in either original currency borrowed. or in the local currency with the current exchange rate.\nR' Yaakov Blau says that because the stipulation in the loan was to pay back in foreign currency, it is like a loan of \"foreign currency\" and is forbidden (unless the borrower possesses one unit of the foreign currency).</p>\n\n<p>One simple solution is to give the borrower one pound, and then you could lend to him in pounds.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Theoretically, one should be able to pay back a loan in some \"equivalent\" manner.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, currency values fluctuate all the time.</p>\n\n<p>R' Blau is addressing a different problem: By the borrower possessing at least one unit of the other currency, it is no longer \"foreign\" to him - and then the loan can be made in that currency.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn't solve the problem of forbidden interest.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, we want to minimize burden on the lender, so that lenders will continue to lend.</p>\n\n<p>In the specific case above:  The lender should wire (let's say $1,000) US dollars to the borrower's bank account in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>This will automatically be converted to, let's say, 667 Pounds Sterling.  (assuming 1.5 dollars to the pound)</p>\n\n<p>When the borrower goes to repay, he should wire $1,000 US dollars back to the lender's account in the US.</p>\n\n<p>IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY POUNDS THIS COSTS THE BORROWER TO ACCOMPLISH.</p>\n\n<p>It might be less, or more, than the 667 pounds he received.  That's irrelevant.  As long as the lender receives the exact amount of the same currency he lent out, there is no interest.</p>\n\n<p>Because the potential for ribis is so great when borrowing in one currency and repaying in another, I am always very careful to follow the procedure above.  The key is, the lender ends up with the same amount of the same currency that he lent, at the end of it all.</p>\n\n\n",

(Of course, the Satan is mentioned in the Tenakh, in particular, in Chronicles and Job.)</p>\n\n<p>Even though Genesis doesn't explicitly call out the serpent as the Satan, this nonetheless seems to be a reasonable conclusion among some theologians, particularly in light of the Satan's dealings with G-d in Job.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, <strong>what is the general consensus about the serpent in the Garden of Eden</strong>? Do scholars believe this was the Satan mentioned in Job? </p>\n\n<p>Whether the creation account is interpreted literally or allegorically, we are left with this figure, represented by a snake, that draws humans towards evil.

Only after its sin was it downgraded to the level of all the other animals (or perhaps below the level of most animals).

(As @avi noted, the Satan is traditionally believed as being the evil inclination and/or the angel of death.) In this case, either there was no actual snake at all, or the Satan appeared in the form of a snake. [R' Saadia Gaon brought in Ibn Ezra.]</li>\n<li>There was an actual snake, but it never really spoke. The Torah \"speaks in the language of Man\" when it writes \"The snake said...\", the same way one would say \"That food is saying 'Eat me'\". The snake, by climbing on the Tree of Knowledge and eating its fruits was \"telling\" Eve that the fruits were good and harmless.

(Some might understand this to mean that they are 'bad things' which really are good, and necessary.</p>\n\n<p>In Judaism, the Satan is an angel commanded by Gd to accuse human beings of wrong things.  In modern terms, you might call satan the heavenly prosecutor, who seeks to bring all people to court.  </p>\n\n\n",

But this seems to describe a temporary journey, such as a shuttle flight.  What is the rule if one is living in space for an extended time?  Edit: Would each individual determine his own time (if it's based on home/departure city), or would the community living there determine a time together to reduce the chaos of varied Shabbat times in the same place?</p>\n\n<p>(This is related to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7182/when-does-a-day-start-end-in-the-far-north-south\">this question</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8282/shabbat-in-the-arctic\">this question</a>, but these questions are about earthly sunset-less days, which might be different.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Again.

After all, the Torah says that you should do the commandments \"all of the days which you are alive on this earth\" (Deut. 12:1), maybe we aren't obligated to perform the commandments in space or on the moon.  Rabbi Shlomo Goren, in an interview published in HaZofeh (and republished in J.David Bleich, Contemporary Halakik Problems, Vol. I, at 211) reasoned that since one cannot survive in the environment of space without bringing earthly oxygen and water with him, he is still \"on this earth\" for purposes of this, now, very real discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The simple answer is that when outside of the earth's atmosphere, normal measures of time, such as sunrise and sunsets, and lunar rotations that help us count the months, are useless.  Therefore, one would designate the time and calendar events that occur in his home port, e.g. Houston or Cape Canaveral.  One would do much the same thing if going to the North or South Pole.

However, the Pri Mgadim says that \"if one eats bread after chatzos, he doesn't say 'Al Nharos Bavel'\" (which means one wouldn't say Tachanun at such a time), and the Shulchan Aruch was not exact with the words \"after mincha\". </p>\n\n<p>However, according to the Gr\"a it would come out that the wording of the Shulchan Aruch was exact, and one would say Tachanun after Chatzos until Mincha. </p>\n\n<p>However, the questioner asks that with regards to a Tachanun of a late Shacharis, even the Pri Megadim would agree that one has to say it even after Chatzos.

Why is there a need for more?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>In Isur Veheter there is a concept: \"Ain Taam Yotzei Mchaticha Lchaticha blo Rotev\". Taste can't transfer without liquid. So if a slice of bread absorbed meat taste (so there is no actual meat in the bread, just taste), then one puts that (hot) bread on (hot) cheese, the taste cannot go from the bread into the cheese.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of this idea is \"Shtei Kdeiros\", if two pots, one cooking meat and one cooking milk touch each other on the outside, if there is no liquid there, the pots do not become traif because the taste doesn't transfer.</p>\n\n<p>When one double wraps food, he is creating that situation. Let's say he is cooking food in a traif dirty oven (and there is steam, which halachically is considered like the food itself). The outer layer of foil (or whatever other material one uses) becomes traif. If it was only one layer, that traif taste in the foil would transfer directly to the food, possibly causing the food to become traif. Now, if there are two layers, the taste must go from the outside layer into the inside layer first, before getting transferred into the food. However, because there is no liquid between the two layers, there is no taste transfer and, therefore, the food stays kosher.</p>\n\n<p>The third layer is probably a backup in case the second layer has a hole, gets slightly unwrapped, etc. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/is_your_oven_kosher_what_every_kosher_cook_must_know/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article from the OU</a>, which discusses the different Kosher issues to be aware of when using an oven and why you have to double-wrap food.</p>\n\n<p>Read the article for many nuances not mentioned here, but here's a short rundown.</p>\n\n<p>We'll assume you're baking milk products in a meat oven.</p>\n\n<p>In short. There are three possible areas of concern:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Zeiah (steam): When previously baking an uncovered wet meat dish, the steam may have gotten absorbed in the walls of the oven. Now when you're baking a milk dish, the steam goes from the food to the walls, connecting the two and transferring the taste taste from the walls of the oven into the food. You now have a mixture of milk and meat. Problem. This assumes a clean oven, if the oven is dirty (i.e. has particles of meat in it) this is a stronger problem, since now the dairy steam connects directly to meat particles in the oven.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reicha (aroma): L'chatchila, we are worried that the aroma from one food may transfer to another food and make a forbidden mixture. If the oven is dirty, the meat food that is sticking to the oven may transfer the aroma into the food, which you are not allowed to do.</p></li>\n<li><p>Oven racks: The oven racks may be dirty, and when you put the milk pan on the meat residue, you will transfer the taste of the meat into the milk and cause problems. There are those who are lenient in this regard, see the article.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Covering the food when cooking takes care of these issues. With Regards to Steam, and certainly Aroma, a single covering should suffice, but to ensure no leakage, a double covering is recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Even with regards to the oven rack, some authorities maintain that any spilled residue on the rack is halachically inconsequential, since it gets burned up, but since other authorities disagree, it is best to cover the rack (or have a different rack). In lieu of that, it appears covering the food with a double covering should be sufficient.</p>\n\n\n",

The rationale here is that \"carrying\" requires both an akira (uprooting) and hanacha (setting).

If you're just in a karmelis, you may not need to worry about it as much.

If that's not possible, you should try getting to another reshus hayachid to drop it off in. If you have to pause at a red light, move in circles so as to avoid stopping. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rambam on Olam Haba, Mashiach, and Techiyat haMeitim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Could somebody explain to me briefly what the Rambam's opinion is about the sequence of events with Olam HaBa, the Mashiach and Techiyat haMeitim?</p>\n\n<p>It seems that he's saying that when a person dies they go straight to Olam HaBa, the ultimate reward, but if so I don't understand how Techiyat haMeitim fits into this.</p>\n\n<p>(I've been reading the Ramchal (Derech Hashem, Ma'amar haIkarim, and Da'at Tevunot), and he follows the Ramban's opinion, and I'm very happy to continue my progress reading the Ramchal, but I'm afraid I'm going to embarrass myself in conversation if I'm totally ignorant the Rambam's opinion.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Olam Habba can refer to both the reward a person has after he passes away and the ultimate reward the whole world has when Moshiach comes.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, the order is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The person passes away and his soul goes to Olam Habba</p></li>\n<li><p>Moshiach comes and then the soul is resurrected by Techiat HaMeitim. </p></li>\n<li><p>Eventually, the body will die again and the soul will spend the rest of eternity in Olam Haba.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read more about it, and the Ramban's take on the issue <a href=\"http://beta.moshiach.com/index.php/component/zoo/item/nachmanides-radical-new-world?Itemid=131\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are many different stages according to the Rambam. There is a world where (righteous) people go after they die (some call this 'olam haneshamos'). In this world, there is a time when Mashiach comes, bringing world peace and the rebuilding of the Beis haMikdash, but the world continues running its natural course. At some point, techiyas hamesim will happen, and those who merit it will be brought back to life to reach a higher perfection. They will live for a long time before dying again. Then the physical world will end and there will be the eternal Olam haBa for the righteous.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam holds, I think, as said before, Olam Haba is after one dies. At some point Moshiach comes to this world, and then there is Techiyas Hamaisim. However, your question then was well if thats the case, what is the purpose of Techiyas Hamaisim? Which is a great question regardless of the order... One answer I heard is that one of the disadvantages of linear time is that we are limited to the teachers we have at the time we live in, but imagine if Moshe and David and the Rambam and Rashi could give class today, or just to be in the room with all of them, or thebenfit each of them would receive from each other... that would be a tremendous benefit to the furtherence of limud Torah and recognition of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason was that even though you may not split a Posuk, anything less than 3 words is not considered splitting. </p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan says that you should say the entire Posuk (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#v131\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 1:31</a>) quietly, even the words before <em>VaYehi Erev VaYehi Voker</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Those that do say <em>VaYehi Erev VaYehi Voker</em> before saying <em>Yom HaShishi</em> why do they say it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=794&st=&pgnum=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">The <em>Chasam Sofer</em></a> answers: People want to start with \"<em>yom hashishi</em>\" to make the acrostic (with \"<em><b>y</b>om <b>h</b>ashishi <b>v</b>ay'chulu <b>h</b>ashamayim</em>\"), but that makes a meaningless half-phrase, so they start with the start of the phrase. They'd start at the start of the <em>pasuk</em> so as not to split a <em>pasuk</em>, but are loath to do so, as the first half of the <em>pasuk</em> (\"<em>tov</em>\") refers to death (<em>B'reshis Raba</em> 9:5). So they start with \"<em>vay'hi</em>\". (He implies that he's writing to justify the custom. He doesn't say — or not there, anyway — to follow it.)</p>\n\n<p>(Thanks to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&pgnum=150\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Taame Haminhagim</em> (footnote to 288)</a> for pointing me to this.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In Sefer <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48000&st=&pgnum=76\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chaim Sheyesh Bohem</a> he brings down in the name of Rabbi Mordechai Brisk Zatzal that in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22498&st=&pgnum=356\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mesechtas Sofrim Perek 21 Halacha 6</a> that VaYehi Erev is a Posuk on its own and therefore there is no problem saying it as is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reason not to say a partial pasuk is that we have a rule \"not to punctuate the Torah where Moshe Rabenu did not punctuate it.\" This means that we may not quote phrases or clusters of words in isolation without quoting the entire verse from which they came, lest we presumptuously punctuate the Torah in a 'more preferable' way than the original, or give the appearance of doing so.</p>\n\n<p>If Rav Moshe Feinstein did not apply this rule to word clusters shorter than 3 words (do you have a source for that?) it was probably because he was employing another rule, which is that no pasuk is shorter than 3 words. Thus splitting off two words from a pasuk could never give the above impression.</p>\n\n<p>If others, cognizant of the above two rules, still do not say the two words \"yom hashishi\" from the previous pasuk it may be because (guessing) they are not ascribing knowledge of the rules to others around them (as Rav Moshe was) and are therefore afraid that the mistaken perception that those two words form an entire verse (or are part of the following verse) is still possible.</p>\n\n\n",

(The Shulchan Aruch HaRav says that the custom is to be lenient). </p>\n\n<p>According to the side that says it is prohibited to open books with writing on Shabbos, it would appear that <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5760/bo.html\">bottles should be opened before Shabbos.</a></p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"http://rygb.blogspot.com/2008/10/numbers-and-letters-on-bottlecaps.html\">Yalkut Yosef</a> permits it because opening a can is a Psik Reisha Dlo Nicha Lei (One doesn't care to have the letters erased) in a Derrabannan case (only erasing for the purpose of writing is from the Torah). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, it is still possible that according to the Shu\"a Harav it would still be prohibited to open soda bottles, as a soda cap may be considered one entity with the ring (when it is closed), and opening it may be considered erasing, while in the book it was never on one surface.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In the Mishna Brura, it writes that it is forbidden to write and erase any language.

One may puncture the lid first, thus rendering it useless and then open the bottle as usual (See Emes L’yaakov OC 314:8). R’ Ribiat (39 Melochos p841) writes that if one has a spare lid, one may open the bottle and discard the lid. R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yechave Daas 2:42) and R’ Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer 14:45) permit opening such bottles.</p>\n<p>R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yalkut Yosef, Shabbos 2:p519) writes that one may open a bottle even if there is writing printed on the lid which will get broken, though R’ Neuwirth and others forbid it.While many are particular not to open plastic lids on Shabbos, R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (quoted in Meor Hashabbos 6:4) allows it, as the cap was already made into a kli in production. One who doesn’t open bottles and cans on Shabbos shouldn't ask someone who usually does to do so for them, though if someone else opened it, they may drink from it (Igros Moshe OC 4:119:5).</p>\n<p>Providing the tins are disposed of immediately after use, R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Minchas Shlomo 2:12, Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 9:n10) and R’ Ovadia Yosef allow one to open them on Shabbos (See Igros Moshe OC 1:122). The Chazon Ish (OC 51:11) writes that by opening a tin, one is creating a kli which is an issur deoraisa.</p>\n<p>Even those Poskim who allow opening bottles and tins on Shabbos write that one should ideally open them before Shabbos or puncture the lid (or bottom of the can) before opening them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He once made a party and said to his servant,\n  “Go and bring Kamtza.” The man went and brought Bar Kamtza.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the man who gave the party found Bar Kamtza there he said, “See,\n  you are my enemy; what are you doing here? Get out!” Said the other:\n  “Since I am already here, let me stay, and I will pay you for whatever\n  I eat and drink.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Because of Kamtza and Bar Kamtza, Jerusalem was destroyed Said the\n  host: “Absolutely not.”</p>\n  \n  <p>“Then let me give you half the cost of the party.”</p>\n  \n  <p>The host refused.</p>\n  \n  <p>“Then let me pay for the whole party.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Still the host refused, and took him by the hand and threw him out.</p>\n  \n  <p>Said Bar Kamtza, “Since the Rabbis were sitting there and did not stop\n  him, this shows that they agreed with him. I will go and inform\n  against them to the government.”</p>\n  \n  <p>He went and said to the emperor, “The Jews are rebelling against you.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Said the emperor, “How can I know that this is true?”</p>\n  \n  <p>“Send them an offering,” said Bar Kamtza, “and see whether they will\n  offer it on the altar.”</p>\n  \n  <p>So he sent with him a fine calf. While on the way he made a blemish on\n  its upper lip (or as some say, on the white of its eye)—in a place\n  where we count it a blemish but they do not.</p>\n  \n  <p>“Because of the scrupulousness of Rabbi Zechariah, our House has been\n  destroyed . . .” The rabbis were inclined to offer it in order not to\n  offend the government. Said Rabbi Zechariah ben Avkulas to them:\n  “People will say that blemished animals are offered on the altar.”</p>\n  \n  <p>They then proposed to kill Bar Kamtza so that he should not go and\n  inform against them, but Rabbi Zechariah ben Avkulas said to them, “Is\n  one who makes a blemish on consecrated animals to be put to death?”</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yochanan thereupon remarked: “Because of the scrupulousness of\n  Rabbi Zechariah ben Avkulas our House has been destroyed, our Temple\n  burnt, and we ourselves exiled from our land.”\n  -Talmud, Gittin 55-56</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first half of the story I believe is known by everyone.

The first Bait Hamikdash was destroyed because Zechariyah ben YiHoyada was too haughty (As brought in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14384&pgnum=463\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midrash Kohelet 10:4</a>). The Second Beit Hamikdash was destroyed because Zechariyah ben Avkulas was too humble (as brought in the Gemara here).</p>\n\n<p>Midrash Eicha (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14384&pgnum=405\" rel=\"nofollow\">4:3</a>) has a different version of the story. In that version, R' Zechariya ben Avkulas was at the party, and didn't protest when Bar Kamtza was kicked out. Commentaries there explain that he was too humble, and didn't want to appear as if he was raising himself up in front of his host. And this is why we say \"the humility of R' Zechariya ben Avkulas caused the destruction of the Temple\". (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33182&pgnum=226\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shlomo Buber's Midrash Eicha</a> combines the two versions) </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But to (perhaps) answer your question, even if you want to translate it as \"scrupulousness\", the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6705&pgnum=63\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beis Levi points out</a> that the Magen Avraham (Orach Chaim Chapter 640) says that we learn from this story that one may violate a negative prohibition out of fear of the (non-jewish) government that rules over you. I didn't look up the sources mentioned there, so I don't know exactly what the conditions of this halacha are.</p>\n\n<p>So before the story happened, R' Zechariyah didn't know that he may violate a negative commandment and kill Bar Kamtza (or offer the animal anyway). It was only afterwards that the halacha became clear. So he wasn't being Machmir, he was following (what he thought was the) halacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In the case at hand, actually, we're not really talking about chumros. It is black-letter law that you can't offer a blemished animal on the Altar, and it is equally black-letter law that creating such a blemish doesn't make the offender liable to death. The problem with R. Zecharyah's approach wasn't that he was looking for chumros that didn't exist before, but that he failed to apply \"eis laasos la-Hashem,\" not realizing that he's thereby putting all of Jewry in great danger. (Suppose, after all, that the Jews had managed eventually to beat back the Romans and save Yerushalayim and the Beis Hamikdash - the war alone cost many Jewish lives.)</p>\n\n<p>It's true, then, that the same consideration applies to chumros. But I don't think you'll find any authority who claims that they are an end in and of themselves, and that they should override other considerations. Consider R. Tarfon getting in trouble for being machmir in accordance with the opinion of Beis Shammai (Berachos 10b) - because it was vital in that period to demonstrate that the halachah follows Beis Hillel. Or consider the Beis Halevi's \"I'm not being lenient about eating on Yom Kippur, I'm being stringent about pikuach nefesh.\" That doesn't mean that chumros don't have their place, as an expression of our desire to fulfill Hashem's will in the best possible way, where there are no such overriding considerations.</p>\n\n\n",

Each human has a <em>neshama</em>, however, Jews have two <em>neshamot</em> - one that all the nations have, and an extra one that only Jews have. Additionally, there is a third <em>neshama</em> that only Jews Receive on shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>That answer there is just wrong. It represents that the Lubavitcher Rebbe says that the level of <em>Neshamah</em> is not present with non-Jews. In fact, the Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/tm/13/31/291\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that all 5 levels of Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Chaya and Yechida exist in all human souls. The distinction between G-dly and not is precisely in the additional soul (which is what Tanya speaks about - a whole separate one - in other words a divine connection and influence necessitated and determined by the additional Mitzvos required of a Jew over a non-Jew, and the corresponding ability to actualize those requirements).</p>\n\n<p>In other places it speaks about the language of Ger Shenisgair - a <em>convert</em> who converts - rather than a non-Jew who converts, that actually the potential for conversion was pre-existing (he was a convert before he actually converted). Thus that very same influence and connection can exist with someone who is currently non-Jewish. My own observation is that this influence is often seen in many conversion stories - a pull and attraction to Judaism that just seems to come out of nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>I think the misunderstanding comes from the fact that <em>Neshamah</em> (in the Kabbalistic system) refers primarily to the intellectual capacity of the soul, and the G-dly soul is described as primarily intellectually motivated, thus <em>Neshamah</em> can be thought of as being more associated with the G-dly soul. But that is a general association (the <em>Neshamah</em> aspect is more predominant in one over the other), not that it doesn't have it.</p>\n\n\n",

'Who will console me?' she cried out. Jeremiah responded sternly, if you are a real woman, speak to me, but if you are a spirit, depart!' 'I am your mother, Zion!' the woman responded.

On this date, the Lamentations of Jeremiah are recited in the Synagogue followed by the recitation of kinnot, which are the liturgical dirges that lament the loss of the Temples and Jerusalem. In the recitals there are examples of reverse order, which provide listeners the reassurance that blessing and not cursing is the ultimate purpose of God for the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the Book of Jeremiah, the command of Jeremiah to plead to the exiles to pray occurs in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2029%3A7&version=OJB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jer 29:7</a>, but the record of the Babylonian destruction of the temple and the major captivity of exiles does not occur until <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2039%3A1&version=OJB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jer 39:1</a>, which is out of chronological order. The juxtaposition of record and event appear to reassure listeners that blessing and not cursing is the ultimate purpose of God for the Jewish people. In other words, blessing was proclaimed before the destruction of the Temple occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of literary juxtaposition is the reading of the Lamentations of Jeremiah during Tisha B'Av. When recited, they conclude with a juxtaposition order of verses, which have the purpose of ensuring that future blessing is in mind, and not cursing. In this regard, the received Masoretic text reflects that the Lamentations of Jeremiah appear to end on a negative verse. That is, the last parashah of the Lamentations of Jeremiah appear as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations%205%3A19-22&version=OJB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lamentations 5:19-22</a> (OJB)</strong>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup>19</sup> Thou, Hashem, remainest forever;<br>\n  Thy throne from generation to generation.<br>\n  <sup>20</sup> Why dost Thou forget us forever,<br>\n  and forsake us for so long?<br>\n  <sup>21</sup> Restore us, Hashem, to Thyself that we may return;<br>\n  renew yamenu (our days) as of old.<br>\n  <sup>22</sup> Unless Thou hast utterly rejected us<br>\n  and Thou art angry with us beyond measure.</p>\n\n<pre><code>--------------------  REPEATED & ADDED -------------------   \n|  21 Restore us, Hashem, to Thyself that we may return; |\n|  renew yamenu (our days) as of old.                    |\n---------------------------------------------------------- \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verse 21 is added during the recitals of Tisha B'Av so that the Lamentations of Jeremiah would not end on a negative note and leave the impression that the Jewish readers were not blessed. Therefore, Jewish tradition repeats Verse 21 right after Verse 22 so that the reading ends on a positive note.</p>\n\n<p>The justification for repeating and adding Verse 21 in this way is because in the Book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah had declared in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2051%3A64&version=OJB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jer 51:64</a> that his last “words” were words of against the enemies of the Jews. Because the subsequent chapters of the Book of Jeremiah discuss the new Temple and the restoration of the Jewish people, Jewish tradition has repeated and added Verse 21 at the end of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. In this way, the Book of Lamentations is aligned with the Book of Jeremiah that the Jewish people are blessed. </p>\n\n<p>The following excerpt from the Jerusalem Talmud (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/yerushalmi_berakhot_tzvee_zahavy_2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">y. <em>Berachot</em> 8d</a>) is the basis for this understanding in Jewish thought. Words from the Tosefta are in bold font. Please note that the Jewish understanding of the term “words” includes blessing for the Jews per the conversation between Elijah and Elisha. (For example, Elijah and Elisha discussed the Shema, the Creation, and the Consolations of Jerusalem, which were “words” of blessing for the Jews.) This understanding was the essential logic for repeating and adding Verse 21 to the end of the Lamentations of Jeremiah according to oral Jewish tradition. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Jerusalem Talmud</strong> (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/yerushalmi_berakhot_tzvee_zahavy_2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">y. <em>Berachot</em> 8d</a>)   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I:2 A] It was taught: <strong>One may stand to recite the Prayer neither after conversation, nor after laughter, nor after levity, nor after any trivial matter, but only after words of Torah.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>[B]  And likewise one may depart from his associate neither after conversation, nor after laughter, nor after levity, nor after any trivial matter, but only after words of Torah.

    "content": "# Seeking text of a notice published by the Malbim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone told the following story today (or something like the following story. I may be remembering it incorrectly to some extent). He said he had gotten it from a book called <em>Em Habanim S'mecha</em>, which reported it second- (or more-than-second-) hand itself.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <em>Malbim</em>, while a rabbi in Bucharest, wrote in his commentary to <em>Daniyel</em> a strong allusion to when <em>mashiach</em> would come. Other rabbis were upset with him, as it's improper to reveal that date: <em>Yaakov</em> didn't. [See <em>Rashi</em> at the start of <em>Vay'chi</em>.] He published a <em>kol kore</em> (public notice) in his own defense, which ran roughly as follows:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>There was a boy in Bucharest who prepared well and delivered well a speech in honor of his becoming a <em>bar mitzva</em>, and to reward him his father decided to take him on his (the father's) next trip to Leipzig. One day into the journey, the child asked when they would arrive; the father silenced him with a stern look. Some three weeks later, the father asked the wagoner when they'd arrive, and was told \"tomorrow\". The child asked his father why he had been silenced, yet his father later asked the same question. The father replied that after all the farewells and tears, he should have known it's a long trip, so shouldn't have asked after one day; but after all the journey, it's a reasonable question. Likewise here: <em>Yaakov</em> was at the start of the <em>galus</em>, an inappropriate time to reveal the time of <em>mashiach</em>. But after all the journey, it's appropriate.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is a copy of the <em>kol kore</em>, or of its text, available anywhere?

Count the *imadi*s as the actual number, and the *imi*s as an upward bound; for instance, Lamentations is all <em>ami</em>'s, no <em>imi</em>'s).</p>\n\n<p>I'm having trouble pasting code correctly into this template with the right right-to-left order thing working, so I'll do this all in English:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Bookname            \"imi\"      \"me'imi\"     \"imadi\"     \"me'imadi\"\n\nGenesis             7           1           14          0\nExodus              17          0           2           0\nLeviticus           4           0           1           0\nNumbers             1           0           0           0\nDeuteronomy         1           0           3           0\nJoshua              2           0           0           0\nJudges              5           0           1           0\nSamuel              20          0           4           2\nKings               12          0           0           0\nIsaiah              24          0           1           0\nJeremiah            30          0           2           0\nEzekiel             22          0           0           0\nHosea               10          0           0           0\nJoel                4           0           0           0\nAmos                5           0           0           0\nObadiah             1           0           0           0\nJonah               0           0           0           0\nMicah               9           0           0           0\nNahum               0           0           0           0\nHabakuk             0           0           0           0\nZephaniah           3           0           0           0\nHagai               0           0           0           0\nZachariah           2           0           0           0\nMalachi             0           0           0           0\nChronicles          21          0           0           0\nPsalms              11          0           2           0\nJob                 1           0           14          0\nProverbs            0           0           0           0\nRuth                4           0           0           0\nSongOfSongs         1           0           0           0\nEcclesiastes        0           0           0           0\nLamentations        6           0           0           0\nEsther              2           1           0           0\nDaniel              9           0           3           0\nEzraNehemiah        8           5           0           0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I've added <em>v'</em> forms as well.

    "content": "# Why do accidental killers sent to arei miklat go free after the Kohen Gadol dies?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When someone kills accidentaly he is sent to live in an ir miklat (\"city of refuge\") until the Kohen Gadol (\"High Priest\") dies. This seems like an arbitrary time. What does the Kohen Gadol's death have to do with manslaughter? What's the connection?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>A person who killed accidentally had to stay in the City of Refuge until the Cohen Gadol died. This could be 1 day or 80 years.</p>\n<p>If a person killed on purpose or in a completely faultless manner (Onnes), he does not have to stay in the City of Refuge until the Cohen Gadol dies. (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088922/jewish/Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Rotzeach 6:3</a>)</p>\n<p>Killing someone on purpose is black and white, either he did or he didn't. There are witnesses and warning, and there is no uncertainty. Same thing when killing someone in a completely faultless manner, either it was or it wasn't. There is no gray area.</p>\n<p>Killing someone accidentally (Shogeg) on the other hand, enters a zone of uncertainty. How much of the act was purely accidental, and how much of the act was negligence, etc.?</p>\n<p>Judging black and white actions can be done by a human court. Judging intent (the thoughts of man), cannot be judged by a human court, only by G-d (who knows the thoughts of man).</p>\n<p>Only G-d knows how much of the act was the fault of the person, and therefore G-d decides how much punishment the killer needs. G-d arranges it so that the murderer spends exactly as much time as he needs to to in the City of Refuge, in order to atone for his sin. If the killer was only marginally at fault, he would need to spend less time in the City of Refuge. If it was less of a pure accident, he might need to spend more time there.</p>\n<p>As Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882#showrashi=true&v=13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shemot 21:13</a>) tells us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...two people--- one killed accidentally and the other killed with premeditation but there were no witnesses who could testify [against them]. [Hence] the latter one was not executed and the former was not sent into exile. G-d then causes them to meet at the same inn.

(<em>Thus, he must remain confined in exile until the passing of the Kohein Gadol. - Sifri, 20.</em>)</p>\n<p>Another interpretation: Because the Kohein Gadol should have prayed that this pitfall not occur in Israel during his lifetime. (<em>Because of the kohein's fault in not praying, the murderer's exile ends with his death (Makos, 11a). Gur Aryeh objects to this intepretation, contending that Makos does not say this, but merely that, if the murderer should pray for the death of the kohein, his prayer might be effective because the kohein did not pray.</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Lord Sacks addressed this in his weekly message not long ago.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud explains that the Cohen Gadol bears some minute amount of responsibility; \"as he should have begged for compassion.\" The simple explanation is that G-d gives people the free will and ability to do evil things, but this case concerns a mistake. Had the Cohen Gadol prayed more, perhaps G-d would have prevented the mistake from happening.</p>\n\n<p>Though I've also heard it interpreted: \"he should have begged the people to treat each other with mercy\", causing an increased value of life throughout the population and therefore better safety practices, ergo less accidents.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative explanation is given by Rambam in his Guide to the Perplexed: when a national tragedy occurs like the death of a Cohen Gadol, the people are united. So the hot-blooded relative of the victim (the \"blood redeemer\") will put aside his grudge and lose interest in killing the by-mistake (\"accident\" can imply zero culpability) murderer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>1.

Answer, Unconditional Advocacy is Sufficient to Bring Life:</h1>\n\n<p>Obviously, this answer does not represent \"Oral Law\", but other Jewish traditions.</p>\n\n<p>The role of a Priest is often misunderstood - they were only ever Judges of last resort, and their primary role was advocacy.</p>\n\n<p>It is incredibly significant that God ordained advocacy and mercy to be the final word in judgment.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of those truths that \"either clicks\" in you, or doesn't.  But - it is all over Scripture, and all of Scripture can be interpreted in view of God's precept that unconditional advocacy is sufficient to bring life.  (Eve's advocacy for, (and not against), Adam in the Garden; Moses' advocacy for Israel from the mountain; Rahab's advocacy for spies; Samson's advocacy for Israel; David's advocacy on the threshing floor; Job being restored - only after he advocated for his friends; and on and on and on).  The opposite of this truth is all over Scripture too: God will judge according to our own judgments - and if we judge with condemnation, then no right subsists for us to plead for unconditional mercy. </p>\n\n<p>The Kohen Gadol was a part of the judgment, and fully aware of their responsibilities to advocate for a killer - for the rest of their lives.  This is always what it meant to be a priest: unconditional advocacy.</p>\n\n<p>And \"life\" was the value of their unconditional advocacy.</p>\n\n<p>I don't even know where to begin providing Scriptural support for this - because it is literally all over the place - and ingrained absolutely in all priests, and a constant reminder through every blood sacrifice offered.  But, let me know - and I will update to address any question/objection.</p>\n\n\n",

Then as they came to America, each picked up from the local style to some degree or other.

There are also many sources that discuss the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9690/what-portion-of-his-income-would-a-jew-following-the-sacrificial-laws-give\">agricultural requirements for charity</a>, but one would need to figure out how to apply their principles nowadays. Few people are farmers nowadays, and there is also much greater wealth and standard costs than before. </p>\n\n<p>Everything a person earns he owns, wealth cannot just be re-distributed by some government to create equality. Each person then as an obligation to give charity. Every year, he must give a small amount to charity to fulfill the most basic obligation. However, he is expected to give at least 10% of his income to charity, (but not more than 20%), either m'drabanan or by minhag (or even md'oraysa, according to one view). If he does not give enough charity, the courts can forcably take large amounts from him: </p>\n\n<p>כי הא דרבא כפייה לרב נתן בר אמי, ואפיק מיניה ד' מאה זוזי לצדקה. (Kesubos 49b)</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the individual in general can choose to some extent how he wants to give away his money, just that if he doesn't give, it will be collected forcibly. It seems that he must give a flat-rate of 10% to charity, but it may be that this might they vary based on social need. The issue is to define what is considered a need that will require the rich to give charity to the poor. The gemara discusses the different charity organizations that existed and who was eligble to receive from them. For example, one who had less than 200 zuz, could take from maaser ani (the argicultural tithe). If one was even poorer, he was eligible to take from the weekly money collection (kupah), and the truly poor would take from the daily food collection (tamchui). The issue is applying these amounts to modern times when expenses have changed so much. </p>\n\n<p>R. A. Levine Discusses these issues at length in \"Economics & Jewish law\". He demonstrates that poverty should be defined as \"bare subsistence\". The Talmud learns from \" דֵּי מַחְסֹרוֹ\" that we are not obligated to make the poor wealthy. He argues that one should take the \"budgetary approach\" to defining poverty, which evaluates the basic costs of food and what percentage they take up of a poor family's expenses to define certain poverty lines. Such definitions would establish when a person is able to receive public assistance. However, someone slightly poor may still be eligible for private assistance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, there is no Jewish idea of wealth redistribution to create equality, but society must provide for the basic needs of the poor. The individual has certain leeway in choosing where to give, but if he fails, the government should collect it by force. The basic rate of giving seems to be a flat-rate, but if there's great need perhaps that may change.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think that no answer to this question can be complete without discussion of the laws of Shmitta and Yovel.  Neither of these ideas exist at all in the economic world of modern industrialized countries.</p>\n\n<p>Shmitta (the sabbatical year, once every seven years) is a year of not working the land, with the effect that one may not grow crops like wheat, legumes, or vegetables.  Rabbinic extensions to the laws prohibit eating even grains or vegetables that grow by themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, everything that grows during Shmitta is effectively ownerless, and anyone may come and help themselves to fruits or other permitted crops.  There can also be no extended storing of Shmitta crops: when a food is unavailable in the fields, it must be removed from one's home and declared ownerless.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the Shmitta year, all debts are cancelled.  There are rabbinic workarounds to this, for fear that lenders would stop lending as the end of Shmitta approached, which would be worse for borrowers.</p>\n\n<p>Yovel (the jubilee year, once every 50, at the end of 7 cycles of Shmitta; this is not observed nowadays) has the prohibitions of working the land, like Shmitta.  Beyond those laws, ancestral fields and homes that had been sold are returned to the original owners, and Jewish slaves go free.</p>\n\n<p>In ordinary years, Trumot and Ma`asrot (gifts and tithes) are essentially flat taxes, in that everyone separates the same percentages, even poor people.  However, every 7 or 50 years there is a \"reset\" of sorts which, while not redistributive, evens out some of the gaps between rich and poor, and limits people's ability to acquire.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Well, there are two sides to the story. One one side, according to Judaism, one has private property, and it is forbidden to steal from another. Whether it be rich stealing from poor or poor from rich.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, one can be forced to give tzedaka. Normally we say that one is not forced by Beis Din to do mitzvos that have a reward (and Tzedakah has a reward mentioned <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0515.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">explicitly</a>). Moreover, there are times that a chiled (who is not obligated in commandments) must give tzedakah. The Ktzos Hachoshen learns that the reason one can be forced to give tzedakah is because it is a financial obligation to the poor, and a child must pay \"debt\". </p>\n\n<p>The explanation given is that all our ownership of property comes from Hashem, so the whole idea of private ownership is dependent on the Torah.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/alei/2-9tzeda.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vbm-torah.org/alei/2-9tzeda.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a story of the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe who walked by a meeting between different groups of Jews who believed in different economic ideas. They asked him which one is right according to the torah. He answered that all systems, being man made, are a mixture of good and bad. The Torah, however, being the ultimate good, contains the the good that is in all the systems.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is downloading pirated music stealing?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Either way, it should be frowned upon as not a nice thing to do, but would it actually be assur?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, it is theft. The creator of the product (in this case the song) has agreed on his terms to provide the product for a set price. Instead of purchasing the song you are consciously resorting to other methods that the creator has not consented to in order to get hold of the product.</p>\n\n<p>The more technical question would be as to what extent you own the song file. When you purchase a physical book it is obvious as to what you've acquired ownership of -- you've bought the physical book so you own the copy from cover to cover. \nBut what about a song file? Does that mean you can upload your file to some site and essentially allow people to \"borrow\" it? This can be analogous to physical books. Can you put your book copy into a scanner and print more copies? Yes. Can you distribute these copies to others? No.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that for most people the idea of property becomes conceptually blurry when it comes to the digital realm. It is very easy and virtually effortless to just click \"copy and paste\" and publish something online unlike printing and compiling a book, so it's very easy to not realize that something as simple as that would constitute theft.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hilchos Geneiva v'Aveida clearly says that someone can't steal the <em>smell</em> of something. Simply, that's because the person you \"steal\" it from <strong>isn't lacking anything!</strong> So seemingly that would be the case here, since the original owner isn't losing any money / property just because one more person downloaded it, it's just like smelling something where even though the smell doesn't belong to you, and maybe the owner of the object that smells nice worked really hard on it, but it doesn't damage the owner at all. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question needs a short clarification:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Based on the Torah, the Gemmorah differentiates between <strong>Gnevah (גניבה)</strong>, which is a robbery and <strong>Gzelah (גזילה)</strong> which is any other monetary damage either direct or indirect (e.g גזל שינה - sleep deprivation). The Gemmorah itself started (unfortunately) use those terms interchangeably and that continues through the Halachah till nowadays.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another point is the very <strong>definition of \"the property\" being stolen</strong>. The original, Talmudic Judaism has no idea of a non-physical property, and therefore no idea of stealing such property. Instead, it discusses ways of indirect damages, that can be evaluated in monetary compensation, e.g. blocking someone's view (היזק ראיה) is not considered stealing (גזילה), but damaging (נזק). Therefore, (originally) Judaism does not recognize any idea of intellectual property. </p></li>\n<li><p>Another important point is <strong>the ability to sue</strong>. Unlike stealing of the physical property that can be sued or damages that can be compensated, all other types of property cannot be sued. Therefore, as many already pointed, it falls under \"general bad stuff\" that can only be banned or excommunicated.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>\"Dina deMalchutah\"</strong> is the only loophole to allow our Halacha to embrace the idea of the intellectual property, just like any other monetary regulation, I do, however, doubt if any serious Beis Din would discuss such claims.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

It appears in Sefer Chasidim from the 12th century as well. Shortly afterwards it appears in the Halachic book סמ\"ג.

Since all information about the Judges in Muslim writings came from Jewish sources- this points at very early stages of appearance in Jewish thought.</p>\n<p>One more significant source is the Targum Yonatan ben Uziel on Jeremiah 9:22 who ties between Hagibor and Samson. The whole idea as if Zionism 'Invented' the concept of Jewish Heroism is close to absurd and many times based on pure ignorance.

The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 219:6) suggests that this custom may have developed because women weren’t always present for Leining. Nonetheless, the Baer Hetev (219:1), Chayei Adam (65:6), Yechave Daas (4:15) and others all allow a woman to say it loudly from her side of the mechitza.

For example Reuven is a buyer from XYZ corp, Shimon is a salesman for ABC inc. Shimon wants to sell widgets to XYZ corp so he comes to Reuven and tries to convince him to have XYZ corp buy them for $100 a piece. Reuven says XYZ corp will pay $120 a piece but I want you to give me (Reuven personally) $10 a widget. So Reuven and Shimon are stealing from XYZ corp.</p>\n\n<p>There are many variations but they all boil down to stealing from a third party. With paying off politicians the third party is the government/the taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>So I would say that kickbacks are just simple theft.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In your revised examples: In example 1 they have stolen $10,000 from Company A. In example 2 they have stolen $1,000,000 from the government.</p>\n\n<p>Stealing and dishonest business dealings are definitely Torah prohibitions. In example 2, bribery would probably be an issue too.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The halacha discusses commission based arangements as far as the question of Ribbis (usery).

    "content": "# Piyyutim on Yomim Noraim. Why do we split phrases against their meaning?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is it that in the davenning for Yomim Noraim, we split up the phrases in many of the piyyutim against their real meaning? \nFor example, in “<em>Vechol maaminim shehu</em>…” (p 538 Artscroll Machzor For Yom Kippur): we say “<em>Hoochaiz beyad midas Mishpot</em>” (1) alone. We then go on to say “<em>Vechol maaminim shehu kale emuno</em>” (2)  together with “<em>habochain uboaik ginzei nistoros</em>” (3) which is really the beginning of the next “verse”.<br>\n(1) and (2) really belong together. See the Artscroll commentary which notes the practice but does not explain it.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I don't know for certain, but based on old machzorim, I have a guess.</p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, in piyyutim said responsively, the chazzan said the first phrase, and the kahal answered with the rest of the line.  (This fits the pattern not only of <em>Ha'ochez B'yad</em> but also <em>Attah Hu Elokenu</em> and <em>L'Kel Orech Din</em>.  In an inverted way, it also fits <em>Melech Elyon</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>So as not to skip any words, (a) the kahal continued past the end of the line, saying the phrase that the chazzan would say soon, and (b) the chazzan started, not from the beginning of the line, but from where he left off in the previous line.  The result is the practice that we have today.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I think I'm right is that the same thing happened to Kedusha, in many shuls.  But we don't notice it, because we understand it better and it's more familiar.  </p>\n\n<p>It used to be, the chazzan said \"<em>N'kaddesh...v'kara zeh el zeh v'amar</em>, \"<em>l'umatam baruch yomeru</em>,\" and \"<em>uvdivrei kodsh'cha katuv lemor</em>,\" with the kahal saying <em>Kadosh</em>, <em>Baruch</em>, and <em>Yimloch</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what happens is, the kahal says <em>N'kaddesh</em>, the chazzan says <em>N'kaddesh</em>, the kahal says <em>Kadosh</em> and <em>l'umatam</em>, the chazzan says <em>Kadosh</em> and <em>l'umatam</em>, the kahal says <em>Baruch</em> and <em>uvdivrei</em>,  the chazzan says <em>Baruch</em> and <em>uvdivrei</em>, then the kahal says <em>Yimloch</em>, then the chazzan says <em>Yimloch</em>.  Exactly the same pattern! </p>\n\n\n",

When you turn each page you're changing the state of the letters stamped on the sides, but they weren't whole to begin with so is there a problem of writing or erasing?

As a side point, R Ribiyat in his lamed tes melachos sefer points out that he doesn't understand the common leniency of breaking the writing through putting a sheet of paper in between the letters, because it does not break the letters from one who looks at a 90 degree angle straight down at the writing.

If the second set was broken, then it doesn't have to fit upright or the like: it was in pieces. So as long as the total interior volume of the <em>aron</em> is (slightly more than) the total volume of the two sets of <em>luchos</em>, that's enough. The interior volume of the <em>aron</em> would seem to be more than 2*1*1 square <em>amos</em>, while the total volume of the two sets of <em>luchos</em> would seem to be 1*1*.5*2*2 <em>amos</em> (if there are six <em>t'fachim</em> to an <em>ama</em>), so what's the problem? (Even if there are five <em>t'fachim</em> to an <em>ama</em> — and, again, I haven't checked the sources — you need only (6/5)^3 times that volume, or 3.456 cubic <em>ama</em>, which the interior of the <em>aron</em> should be fine with (2.5*1.5*1.5=5.625, so even once we subtract the width of the walls (which I don't know offhand) I imagine it's fine).</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is all without recourse to resources, but it seems right.</p>\n\n\n",

Yitshak Yosef as well. He writes in Yalkut Yosef (271:42):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מותר לקדש בכוס העשוי לשימוש חד פעמי, או כוס נייר, וכדומה. אך אם יש לו כוס אחר, עדיף יותר לקדש בכוס אחר, ויקיים בעצמו, זה אלי ואנוהו, התנאה לפניו במצות. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, one may use a disposable or paper cup. However if one has a nicer cup it would be appropriate to use it in fulfillment of \"zeh eli v'anvehu\", doing mitsvot as nicely as possible.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] This seems to be the intent of שנעשה מנייר שהוא כלי רק לשעה, that a paper cup cannot be used indefinitely.

Being that according to nature it would be strange that such a thing could happen, the questioner wanted to know if this comes from \"Kochos Hatumah\" or not.</p>\n\n<p>The Bnei Tzion answered that he asked scientists as to their opinion of the nature of Hypnosis.

References to notable speeches or documents addressing this topic would be a welcome addition to any answers, as I'm looking more for consensus or \"generally notable\" answers (such as from rabbis of major influence), rather than individual opinions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to Rabbi Herschel Welcher, \"the majority by numbers and structure [<em>rov minyan urov binyan</em>]\" of great rabbis concluded, post-Holocaust, that the world is too dangerous a place without a Jewish state.</li>\n<li>After several national calamities, there have been fervent Messianic hopes/expectations, which happened as well in the late twentieth century (mostly focused on the seventh rebbe of Lubavitch). The late Rabbi Schneurson is quoted as saying that any catastrophes called for before the coming of the Messiah were certainly fulfilled completely. Rabbi Benjamin Blech believes that our current period in history is between <em>and then came the Angel of Death</em> and <em>and then along came G-d</em>, as described in the song Chad Gadya.</li>\n<li>Many customs that had been specific to particular eastern European towns no longer applied, as those towns were abandoned with no plans to return anytime soon. (As opposed to a discussion several centuries ago of a town in Alsace that evacuated temporarily due to some war between France and Germany; under the balance-of-power system at the time, everyone knew they'd be back in town again soon.)  </li>\n<li>Besides the above practical argument for the establishment of a Jewish State is a Talmudic one: the Talmud speaks of several \"oaths\" that would be the foundation of how the Jews whould live in the diaspora: one is that the other nations treat the exiled Jews with some semblance of decency; another is that the Jews not force their way back to Israel. Long before 1939 it was argued that the nations hadn't kept their part of the deal (first oath), so the Jews were exempted from theirs; that argument seemed even stronger post-1945.</li>\n<li>Dr. Haym Soloveichik has famously argued that the value placed on mimetic tradition was broken, and instead, needing something to latch onto, people started following texts, even if in some cases they were far stricter than was the established practice. (For instance, the popularity of <em>Mishna Brurah</em>, written by a dean of a rabbinic academy and saying \"the majority of texts say do X\"; vs. <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>, written by a town rabbi and saying \"common practice is to do Y, this is supported by many texts.\") </li>\n<li>Questions were raised regarding a rabbi's authority or expertise on political matters. Many Eastern European rabbis had told their communities, c. 1939, that the war would blow over, and there was no need to flee. Those rabbis were working with their best understanding of several centuries of history, but the Holocaust was something far beyond that pattern. Some believe that G-d, for reasons we can't understand, let those rabbis be mistaken. A young Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik, pre-Holocaust, had spoken (in a eulogy for Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grozinski) about the authority of great rabbis on political matters; years after the Holocaust, his speech \"Joseph and his Brothers\" challenged this to some degree. While it's subject to interpretation by his students (for instance, Rabbi Mordechai Willig believes there is no conflict between <em>Eulogy for Rabbi Chaim Ozer</em> and <em>Joseph and his Brothers</em>), Soloveichik's student and biographer, Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff, believes that Soloveichik's faith in rabbinic authority on political matters was shattered by the Holocaust.    </li>\n<li>I'm told there are theologians (non-Jewish, from what I understand) whose understanding of Hell was rethought after seeing Auschwitz.</li>\n<li>While we have no right to claim that the obligations of Judaism ceased due to the Holocaust, there is a great deal of reluctance to pass judgement on a Jew who has given up observance (or even faith) after the Holocaust.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe said to many survivors that from the Holocaust we see that one cannot rely on human feelings of morality.

Berachos 4:7), according to which the institution of this service is conditional upon the existence of a communal association -- that is, one that participated in the ma'amad.

But all the other sources in our possession know of an Additional Service only on days when the Additional Sacrifice was brought (compare Num. 28,29).

Various explanations have been suggested for this system. The medieval grammarian and commentator Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi, 1160?-1235?) explained that this system was created because Bible texts were lost during the Babylonian exile and the best scholars died. The later scholars who re-established the text found different readings in the surviving manuscripts and accepted the reading found in the majority of manuscripts, but when they couldn't make up their minds about a reading they indicated both possibilities with these marginal notes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the footnotes, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Kimhi's view on textual criticism see U.

This was started by Moshe in the Torah and then was used as a technique by all the authors of the later books.

Oseh Ma'aseh Vereishis?\nYou say Birchas Gomel if you travel over the sea; do you also say it if the sea travels over you?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>For sepharadim, Birkat HaGomel is said if you were in prison, bedridden for 3 days, or when you travel for more than 72 minutes outside the city (which seems to cover both the midbar and the yam). So just having a hurricane pass through doesn't make you chayav (or permitted, since safek berachot l'hakel) to say HaGomel.</p>\n\n<p>Upon seeing/feeling uncommonly strong winds (a hurricane would qualify), on feeling an earthquake, lightning, or thunder, the Shulchan Aruch says to say Oseh Ma'aseh vereshit, and \"if you want\" Shekocho u'gvurato malei olam. (OC 227) The nosei kelim there say that the custom is to say Oseh Ma'aseh vereshit on lightning, and Shekocho u'gvurato malei olam on thunder. (The mishan berura's psak there is a <a href=\"http://halachafortoday.com/ArchivesBirchasHaRiYah.aspx\">little more complicated</a> about thunder and lightning. Follow the <a href=\"http://halachafortoday.com/ArchivesBirchasHaRiYah.aspx\">link</a> and scroll down to December 10, 2009 to see it.) The mishnah berurah (s.k. 4) says that you say Oseh Ma'aseh vereshit on winds and an earthquake.</p>\n\n<p>Probably what you want to do is make the berachot on the lightning and thunder that will inevitably come along with the hurricane. </p>\n\n<p>I haven't found a Sephardi posek who directly addresses earthquakes and winds. I would hope that Halacha Berurah vol 11 covers it, but I haven't visited a shul with a copy of vol 11 all week. If anyone else can look this up, please tell me what he says (I'm interested in both earthquakes and hurricanes), otherwise I'll try and find a copy over the next couple days.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7626&st=&pgnum=118\">Birkei Yosef (OC 227:5)</a> says that you only say shekocho u'gvurato malei olam on wind if the wind is strong enough to shatter stones and mountains. Otherwise you say oseh ma'aseh vershit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I had a chance to look at Halacha Berurah vol 11 (OC 227), and here's the upshot. The Shulchan Aruch mentions 5 things on which one says <em>oseh ma'aseh vershit</em> and continues \"or if he wants, he can say <em>shekocho u'gvurato malei olam</em>\". Here are the 5 things, and what Halachah Berurah has to say about them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shooting stars or comets: Halacha Berurah says you only ever say <em>oseh ma'aseh vershit</em> on these. Shooting stars and comets differ in how long you're patur from saying <em>oseh ma'aseh vershit</em> again: for shooting stars, you're patur all night. For comets (which remain visible in the sky over a period of days or weeks) you're don't say the bracha again unless it's a different comet or you haven't seen it for 30 days.</li>\n<li>Earthquakes: Halacha Berurah says you may say either beracha on this (but not both). In the footnotes, he brings sources that seem to differentiate between strong and weak earthquakes, but he doesn't say this in his halacha l'maaseh, so I'd personally be incined to say <em>oseh ma'aseh vershit</em> on an earthquake that just rattles the windows, and <em>shekocho u'gvurato malei olam</em> on something that moves the ground enough to be scary or cause damage. (But I'm not a posek.) If the ground stops moving long enough to have hesech hada'at, and then starts moving again (including, but not limited to an aftershock) then you say the beracha again.</li>\n<li>Strong Wind: There are 3 types of wind. Ordinary wind that one encounters on a windy day, you do not say any beracha. For strong wind, he brings the same halacha as the Birkei Yosef: weaker strong winds (I speculate this may refer to the kinds of winds that knock down branches or trees in an ordinary thunderstorm) one says <em>oseh ma'aseh vershit</em> for \"wind that is strong enough to shatter stones and mountains\" (and Halacha Berurah specifically mentions tornadoes and hurricanes as an example of this), you say <em>shekocho u'gvurato malei olam</em>. If the wind stops long enough to have hesech hada'at and then starts up again, you say the beracha again.</li>\n<li>Lightning: The minhag is to say <em>oseh ma'aseh vershit</em>. You're patur from saying another beracha for the rest of the storm.</li>\n<li>Thunder: The minhag is to say <em>shekocho u'gvurato malei olam</em>. You're patur from saying another beracha for the rest of the storm.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The laws of when thunder and lighting come together are a bit complicated, you should read what he has to say. I've come to the conslusion from this that you should say a separate <em>shekocho u'gvurato malei olam</em> over the winds of a hurricaine, in addition to one for any thunder you might hear.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.toratreva.org/Joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=26&Itemid=9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Many</a> <a href=\"http://www.rabbiweisz.com/divrei-torah/shemos/beshalach-birchat-hagomel-benediction-of-deliverance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">people</a> say Birchas Gomel if they feel their life was in danger.

During the week, when there is no mitzva of Tosfos Shabbos, how early can one daven Maariv?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Talmud records two opinions as to the line of demarcation between latest time for reciting Mincha (\"afternoon\") and Maariv (\"evening\") prayers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sunset (and yes we can go into questions of observed sunset vs. astronomical sunset, elevations, and so on, but let's assume \"sunset\" is \"sunset.\")</li>\n<li><em>Plag HaMincha</em>, i.e. 1.25 relative hours prior to sunset.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Either opinion is acceptable, if followed consistently. (And there's a lot of discussion about what \"consistently\" means; the Aruch HaShulchan staunchly defends the practice of reciting first Mincha, then Maariv, at some time after <em>Plag</em> but before sunset.)</p>\n\n<p>So either <em>plag</em> or sunset. It's not about \"I hereby accept it as Tuesday\" by saying the evening prayers Monday afternoon; it's that it's close enough to Tuesday that I can say the prayers. </p>\n\n<p>However, there's the obligation to recite <em>Shema</em> at night; we follow the majority opinion that even if you prayed <em>Maariv</em> earlier, you'd have to repeat <em>Shema</em> \"when the stars come out\" -- which Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled was 45 minutes after sunset in New York City; it would be more minutes further from the equator, less if you're closer. (But don't be surprised to meet <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em> followers who insist on 72 minutes in all sorts of latitudes). </p>\n\n<p>So it's ideal if you could say <em>Maariv</em> after \"stars-come-out\" so you get your Maariv and evening Shema bundled into one; all else being equal, it would probably still be preferable to say <em>Maariv</em> oh -- 20 minutes after sunset (which satisfies \"stars-come-out\" for some rabbis) than immediately after sunset (though either way you'd repeat <em>Shema</em> later).</p>\n\n\n",

Opinions on the length of time it takes to walk a mil vary, but the largest figure is 24 minutes, so 3/4 mil would be 18 minutes. (Candle-lighting would be one of the last things done before Shabbos starts, for the practical reason that this way the light will last longer into the night; indeed, in the Mishnah (Shabbos 34a) it's the last item on the list of things to tell one's household to do before Shabbos.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The Gemara (ibid. 35b) states that after the blast of the shofar signaling that it's time to light Shabbos candles, the signalman would wait \"the time it takes to roast a small fish\" and then blow the final three blasts indicating that Shabbos has begun. We don't know how long that period is, but we find in halachah that roasting takes the time it takes to walk a mil <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=101178&rid=4671\">(Maggid Mishneh to Hil. Maachalos Asuros 6:10)</a>, for which the smallest figure given in halachah is 18 minutes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If someone couldn't light earlier, then we go with the standard halachic understanding that the deadline is sunset. But either of these reasons explains why it's best to light candles at least 18 minutes earlier (and there are some communities where the standard time is even earlier than that - in Jerusalem, for example, candle-lighting time is 40 minutes before sunset).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The \"candle-lighting\" in the term (English translation of הדלקת נרות or ליכט בענטשען) probably refers to the ritual act of lighting candles which is an obligatory act (first recorded by our sages) performed on each Friday evening, and not to the act of lighting candles in general and for other purposes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The time people generally light candles for <em>Shabas</em> is called <em>candle-lighting time</em>. I don't think that that really requires a source: it's standard use of the English language. That means that there may be different views as to what candle-lighting time (even at the same latitude and longitude): many in America use 18 minutes before sunset, but if a certain synagogue tends to pray very early in the summer and women are instructed not to light before <em>p'lag hamincha</em>, then the synagogue's schedule may list <em>p'lag hamincha</em> as \"candle-lighting time\". In other words, I don't think the term has any special meaning beyond \"time to light candles\".</p>\n\n<p>But I have no proof of this.</p>\n\n\n",

Notice the difference in the last word.</p>\n\n<p>Another example: In <em>birchas hamazon</em> Ashkenazim say \"רַחֶם נָא יי אֱלהֵינוּ עַל יִשְׂרָאֵל עַמֶּךָ. וְעַל יְרוּשָׁלַיִם עִירֶךָ. וְעַל צִיּוֹן מִשְׁכַּן כְּבוֹדֶךָ\", while Sefardim say \"רַחֵם יי אֱלֹהֵינוּ עָלֵינוּ וְעַל יִשְׂרָאֵל עַמָּךְ. וְעַל יְרוּשָׁלַיִם עִירָךְ. וְעַל הַר צִיּוֹן מִשְׁכַּן כְּבוֹדָךְ\" Again, notice the \"ךְ\" ending instead of the \"ךָ\".</p>\n\n<p>Although, there are those instances where even Ashkenazim use the female form. (e.g. מודִים אֲנַחְנוּ לָךְ.) But in my limited study of Tanach, I seem to recall God as always being referred to in the male form.</p>\n\n<p>What is the reason for this difference between Ashkenazic and Sefardic liturgy, and its origin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The difference is indeed that between Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrew.  At the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century c.e., there was a movement in Europe to apply Biblical (considered \"classic\" and more high-tone) rules of grammar to prayer.  The advocates of this (among them the highly respected R Wolf Heidenheim) persuaded the editors of Ashkenazic siddurim to use that principal in applying vocalization.  Since this was when adding vocalization to the siddur was becoming more and more popular, this trend was accepted by the public, who often just thought they hadn't been saying it right.  Sephardim retained the traditional pronunciation.  (See <em>The Scholar's Haggadah</em> by Heinrich Guggenheimer, p. 214.)  This applied too to the hidush of pausal \"gafen\" in place of the traditional \"gefen\".     </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <em>-ach</em>-final form is not just a feminine form (even in Biblical but also in later Hebrew) but also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a Biblical-Hebrew <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pausa\" rel=\"nofollow\">pausal</a> masculine form. (E.g., 2 <em>Sh'muel</em> 7:9 has וָאֶהְיֶה עִמְּךָ whereas <em>Sh'mos</em> 3:12 has כִּי אֶהְיֶה עִמָּךְ.) This explanation seems unlikely to me for things like <em>nakdishach</em> (at the start of <em>k'dusha</em>).</li>\n<li>a rabbinic-Hebrew[1] masculine form. (I have no source for this at the moment.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I assume, but do not know, that the use of <em>-ach</em> in <em>k'dusha</em> and the like is in its latter capacity, as rabbinic Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I do not know why the Sephardic text would use the one form and the Ashkenazic text the other.</p>\n\n<p>And if the explanation is that it's pausal (which, again, I doubt), then it's curious to me that <em>S'faradim</em> should use the pausal form and <em>Ashk'nazim</em> not, whereas the reverse is true for <em>bore p'ri hagafen/hegefen</em>.</p>\n\n<p>[1] I.e., <em>l'shon Chazal</em>. I don't know what scholars call this. It's later than Biblical Hebrew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have heard before (no source at this moment though) that, Kaballistically, we are talking to the \"Shechina\" - G-d's presence - which is feminine. Considering the fact that Sefaradim generally tilt towards Kaballah more, especially with regards to prayers, I would assume this is a possible reason</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When saying the Mi SheBerach prayer for a sick amputee, do you say \"for his 248 limbs\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The standard text of the <em>Mi She-Berach</em> prayer for the sick asks that G-d send healing \"to his 248 limbs and 365 sinews.\"</p>\n\n<p>What if someone, G-d forbid, lost a foot a few years ago; and now prayers are being recited for him (for some other condition)? He doesn't have all 248 limbs. (Unless you tell me it's intended according to R. Hayyim Vital's writings that we have 248 spiritual limbs in our soul too ...)</p>\n\n<p>And for that matter, what about someone with <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jB_21eD5BhXK4vAjzlIA0gjmp9nQ?docId=fac54e6be5ce4fa4b02358bb010edc8e\">polydactyly</a> (extra fingers and/or toes, assuming they're in good working order)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In Sefer Nishmat Avraham- Orach Chaim Siman 123 The <em>Pardes Yosef</em> offers a number of reasons why it is unnecessary to change the text of a prayer on his behalf. First: It is known that one's soul is considered to have \"limbs\" corresponding to the physical limbs of the body and, although he has lost one of his physical limbs, all of his spiritual \"limbs\" are still intact. Second: In spite of his missing a limb, he has not lost the potential to pass on the gene for that limb to his children; it is as if the limb is still contained within him. Finally: The prayer can be considered as referring to the collective body of the Jewish people and it is therefore irrelevant if it does not apply to a particular individual, since it is not directed at him personally, but rather to the nation as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal teach us that, in contrast to men who have 248 limbs, women have 252 limbs. Because of this the text of the prayer recited for an ill woman was changes to: \"and all of her limbs and her 365 sinews\" instead of \"248 limbs.\" However, there are many other who disagree, and believe that the text should not be changed since, in terms of halachah, a \"limb\" is defined as a part of the body which can cause a specific kind of ritual defilement. Since men and women are treated alike with regard to the laws of ritual defilement, only 248 can confer impurity. it is only these 248 limbs, therefore, that are considered significant as limbs, and it is for these limbs that we prater when we recite a prayer for a sick person. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>By a lady - who has 252 limbs (Bechoros 45.) א\"ר יהודה אמר שמואל מעשה בתלמידיו של ר' ישמעאל ששלקו זונה אחת שנתחייבה שריפה למלך בדקו ומצאו בה מאתים וחמשים ושנים אמר להם שמא באשה בדקתם שהוסיף לה הכתוב שני צירים ושני דלתות - we say L'Chol Aivoreho, U'Lchol Gideha - <em>so I would think (no source yet)</em> that if a man is either missing a limb or has extra that we would say L'Chol Avorov, U'Lchol Gidov. </p>\n\n\n",

Similar laws apply to vineyards. (Once again this one, as I understand it, isn't so much about the quantity as it is about behavior modification.)</li>\n<li>A small piece (~5%) of dough, when kneading, is given to the Kohen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And from livestock (cows, sheep, goats):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Firstborn cows, sheep, and goats are given to the Kohen.

Giving up to 20% is considered meritorious; beyond that is not recommended as one risks putting themselves into poverty.</p>\n\n\n",

So, there are in fact two \"Rosh Hashana Night\"s (what I think you mean by \"Erev Rosh Hashanah\"): the evening of the 28th and the evening of the 29th. The rituals observed on the second night are essentially identical to those observed on the first night, with the addition of making a \"Shehechayanu\" blessing over a <a href=\"http://judaism.about.com/od/holidays/a/Rosh-Hashanah-Food-Customs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">new fruit</a>. So, as the rituals are supposed to be observed on both nights, either night is equally eligible for your event.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is no Jewish custom of celebrating on <em>erev Rosh Hashana</em> that I'm aware of. It's a day when many supplications are added to the prayers, when many people fast, and when we are all supposed to repent our misdeeds and make plans to do better in the coming year. <em>Rosh Hashana</em> itself, on the other hand, is a time when families get together for festive holiday meals. <em>That</em> is when people at apples and honey, say special blessings, etc. See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4830/jewish/How-is-Rosh-Hashanah-Observed.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> for a good synopsis of <em>Rosh Hashana</em> observances (and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/564108/jewish/Day-Before-Rosh-Hashanah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a> for more on <em>erev Rosh Hashana</em>, though the latter page mentions several Chabad-specific customs).</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, although the question characterizes eating apples and honey as a \"non-religious\" custom, it is mentioned in <em>halacha</em>, which I think qualifies it as \"religious\".</p>\n\n<p>Note that the evening preceding the day of <em>Rosh Hashana</em>, from sunset, is considered part of <em>Rosh Hashana</em> (and happens to be when we eat the apples and honey). The same is true in almost all cases that one is considering a day in Judaism: it starts at sunset.</p>\n\n<p>I'm adding the following is in case I've misunderstood your question, and by \"Erev Rosh Hashanah\" you actually meant the night of (i.e., at the start of) <em>Rosh Hashana</em>: A family meal is good for the night of <em>Rosh Hashana</em> or its day (for lunch, say). Indeed, since <em>Rosh Hashana</em> is two days long, the second night, the night which starts the second day of <em>Rosh Hashana</em>, is still <em>Rosh Hashana</em>, and a good time for a family meal also (and it's customary to eat apples and honey at that time). Apples and honey can be eaten during the day, also: there's no harm in so doing AFAICT, and I've heard that some people do. Also, the blessings that should have been said the night before should be said by day (<em>SA OC</em> 271:8).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Actually, it is quite common for families to celebrate the first evening with one part of the family (say, the wife's family) and the second evening and/or over lunch with another part of the family (say, the husband's family). So you can have an intimate celebration the first evening and a larger one the next day. </p>\n\n<p>Family tradition often shapes the differences between these two celebrations. </p>\n\n\n",

If he doesn't keep quiet, there is an implicit threat that he will be \"dealt with\" in a physical matter (either literally with his life, or simply being beaten...).</p>\n\n<p>Is such a Mashgiach required to be מוסר נפש and report this information to the public anyway? Or is he allowed to keep quiet for fear of his life?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>In the words of the esteemed sage Jerry Garcia:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Constantly choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd advise the individual to get out of the situation as best as he can. There's a similar legend has it regarding Ridbaz, who was a rabbi in Chicago in the early 1900s. He found himself \"accidentally\" locked into a freezer when inspecting a meat plant on a Friday afternoon. Finally he managed to break out, by then it was Friday night. He got up Saturday morning, said \"it's a matter of life and death\", and put himself and his kids on the train to New York.</p>\n\n<p>But to answer your question: I'd presume as it's not \"big three\" (idolatry, murder, severe sexual transgression), he's not obligated to put his life on the line for it. Baltimore's <em>Where What When</em> had a piece c. 2009 from Rabbi Dovid Katz regarding a kosher butcher from long-ago Baltimore; the rabbis had asked that butchers apply tags with the meat's date (so consumers would know that it's been washed within 72 hours); this was the only butcher to do so, and he was threatened with his legs broken or worse; he backed down and removed the tags (though still keeping his meat up to standards).</p>\n\n<p>As everyone else is quoting rabbi stories, here's one: around the year 1770 a man showed up in Prague with some wagonloads of cheese, looking to open a cheese store. He provided the Chief Rabbi of Prague, Ezekiel Landau a.k.a. Noda Bihuda, with a letter from his local rabbi certifying the cheese's kashrut to the highest standards. Rabbi Landau deduced from the way the local rabbi had dated the letter that the cheese was not kosher, but that the cheese merchant could have had the rabbi killed had he not written the letter.</p>\n\n<p>The fly in the ointment is a discussion in the beginning of <em>Ketubot</em> regarding witnesses validating signatures on a document; there is an opinion in the commentaries there that a witness should give up his life rather than sign falsely on something, to preserve the integrity of the system. But I believe we conclude otherwise there. </p>\n\n<p>There is a similar opinion (Maharam Shif I think?) that if someone points a gun at a rabbi's head and says \"rule that X is kosher\" when it isn't, or \"that it's not\" when it is, he's obligated to give up his life rather than allowing Torah to be falsified. But it's counterfeit Torah to say \"cows are a non-kosher species\"; to say \"Shmergie's restaurant uses only kosher-certified ingredients\" when they don't isn't falsifying Torah per se, it's falsifying reality (which is analogous to the witness case above).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly there's the discussion if Jewish law regards torture as worse than death. The Talmud says that Hananya Mishael and Azarya were thrown into a fiery furnace for refusing to bow to Nebuchadnezar's statue, \"but had they been beaten, they would have bowed.\" Some read that as <em>they would have been allowed to do so</em>. (An alternative reading is <em>even though it's prohibited they would have done so because torture can break Biblical heroes too.</em>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R. Ephraim of Vilna writes (http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1405&st=&pgnum=94, bottom of left column and on) that \"apparently, it appears to say that sometimes we find that it is appropriate to turn over an individual, even to be killed, in order to avoid some damage to the public...to prevent any stumbling block or difficulty for the community\" So he is quite clear that when it comes to a potential communal damage, we can turn over an individual to be killed -- so certainly that individual can risk his life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16013&st=&pgnum=120\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> told a story about his father, the Rov of Dnepropetrovsk:</p>\n\n<p>\"The city in which my father was a Rov, was in southern Russia [Dnepropetrovsk, now Ukraine] which had many wheat fields, which supplied the whole Russia with grain. Since he was one of the bigger Rabbonim, the hechsher on baking matzos was always under his hechser. </p>\n\n<p>When the government nationalized all factories, including flour mills and matza bakeries, realizing that since everyone relied on his hechsher for matzos, they realized that if he doesn't put a hechsher on the matzos, they will not be able to sell it. Therefore, the government called him, and told him to put a hechsher on the matzos that year. If he will not put a hechsher on any part of the wheat, they warned him, he will have damaged the economy of the Soviet Union and will be punished as a counter-revolutionary [!!]. </p>\n\n<p>My father answered that if he would be given free reign on the supervision, then he will give a hechsher, if not, then not only would he not give a hechsher, he would publicize that the flour is not under his responsibility. </p>\n\n<p>The government officials re-warned him that unless he OK's the flour, he would be considered a counter-revolutionary. My father responded that he will not do anything against the Torah, and added that he was willing to travel to Moscow and explain to Kalinin how he would not go against Shulchan Aruch.\"</p>\n\n<p>It goes on to explain that in the end, the government backed down, and let the Rebbe's father run the Hashgacha the way he saw fit.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a story (I think published in Who's Who in Chabad) about R' Yaakov Landau (of Bnei Brak) that someone pulled a gun on him and demanded a hechsher.

Rabbenu Tam in Tosafot Avodah Zarah 35a, s.v. chada, says that the reason why Chazal institutes a gezerah against eating gevinat akum is that they were concerned with the milk becoming exposed to snake venom. Like the Rambam, he believes that there is no concern for non-kosher milk since the milk of a non-kosher animal can't be turned into cheese. Rabbenu Tam says that non-kosher milk doesn't become hard, and notes that the nochrim aren't fools because they know this and don't use treif milk in cheese production. He adamantly says that the only concern Chazal had was with snake venom or a non-kosher stomach or enzymes from cattle being used, and he says the gezerah only applies where snakes are rampant. He notes that in many places, gentile cheese is eaten because it is known they used flowers, not stomach or enzymes, to harden cheese, and he notes that the geonim of Narvonne in the south of France allowed the consumption of gevinat akum that uses vegetarian rennet essentially.</p>\n\n<p>The Tablet K seems to hold by such an opinion which allows gevinat akum made with vegetarian rennet. </p></li>\n<li><p>The legitimate concerns that would probably arise are the frequency of inspections- does yotzei v'nichnas inspection mean weekly, monthly, or annual inspections? </p>\n\n<p>It seems to be a small enterprise that supervises so many establishments that it leaves questions as to how frequently they inspect their clients.

    "content": "# Reconciling the evidence for the Uncertainty Principle with belief in an omniscient G-d\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the foundations of modern quantum mechanics is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Uncertainty Principle</a>. This principle is not an assumption, but rather is derived from assumptions made with regard to the structure of nature. The basic statement of the Uncertainty Principle, however, is that it is impossible to know the values of certain characteristics to within an arbitrary accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>If the Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental aspect of the universe, G-d cannot be omniscient. So far, every experiment ever tested on the matter has borne out the practical implications of this principle and yielded the predicted results. How do Jews square this fact with their belief in an omniscient G-d?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The uncertainty principle actually helped the religious case. Before quantum mechanics, people assumed the world was entirely deterministic, without any place for the will of God or man to change anything. Pierre Laplace claimed that one could know the entire future and present just by looking at all the atoms at one point in time. Einstein held so strongly to this deterministic view that he refused to accept the evidence for Quantum Mechanics. </p>\n\n<p>But with quantum mechanics, God can invisibly intervene with the running of the universe without it being detected and without breaking any laws of nature. Since the position of the particles cannot be predicted with certainty, they can also be influenced without detection.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Others can (I hope) provide a more complete answer, but I believe the simple answer is that God exists outside of space and time, and hence is not bound by their restrictions.  Just because something is unknowable to humans does not make it beyond the control of God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>To say what others have answered in different words:</p>\n\n<p>G-d's Holy Name, The Tetragrammaton, is a combination of “Haya” (was), “Hoveh” (is) and “Yihyeh” (will be). </p>\n\n<p>When we say G-d exists out of time we're saying that for G-d the past, present, and future are as one. G-d does not experience time linearly, as we do. Rather, he sees it all as now. (See <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=0azs_9G7AFsC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=tetragrammaton%20past%20present%20and%20future%20as%20one&source=bl&ots=j-yfmphl-i&sig=nrMpid5N31LqJHLMoZH1zPzjLb0&hl=en&ei=EGFgToXsM5KSgQfV-IXKAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=tetragrammaton%20past%20present%20and%20future%20as%20one&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>In this sense, G-d is omniscient because all that will happen to us in the future is already known by G-d, since he - so to speak - is experiencing it now (or has already experienced it).</p>\n\n<p>So, while the outcome of a certain action may presently be unknown to us (due to the Uncertainty Principle), in the future (once it has already occurred) we will know the outcome.</p>\n\n<p>G-d knows that future now.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In response to the comment. This is what is says on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> (Which is just about the extent of my knowledge of the subject):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To measure the velocity of a particle, one must bounce other particles off of it, but such detection necessarily affects the particle being measured. The uncertainty principle says, for instance, that it is impossible to measure a particle's velocity in any moment and then have any hope of measuring its location for that moment (since the act of measurement of velocity immediately changed that particle's location). The observer must choose their knowledge of one time: the particle's location, or knowledge of its velocity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To focus on the first part of that statement, this is my understanding of it. When observing something outside of yourself, you must interact with it. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observe\" rel=\"nofollow\">By definition</a>, observing is something you do to something else, something separate from you. Since it is separate from you, the only way to examine it is interact with it. Interacting with it however, will affect it, and therefore we can never really know what it truly is, only how it reacts to our interaction.</p>\n\n<p>But what if the thing you're examining is not separate from you, what if you just know it because it's you, not because you've examined something external?</p>\n\n<p>To quote from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/54413/jewish/Divine-Knowledge-and-Human-Choice.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> (and please read it for context):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maimonides, therefore, states that if we are to ascribe to G-d the knowledge of all beings and all events, we must conclude that: (a) His knowledge of the countless facts that comprise our existence are, in truth, but a single knowing -- His knowledge of self (since what we call \"existence\" is merely the expression of His infinite potential to create); and (b) He does not know Himself via a \"mind\" that is a distinct from Him, but that He, His knowledge and His \"mind\" are an utterly singular unit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If that's the case, the Uncertainty Principle wouldn't kick in, since G-d wouldn't have to examine it in order to know it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Car falls into my ditch- I'm not responsible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Halacha dictates that if someone were to dig a huge hole in the middle of the street and a car fell into it, he would not be responsible to pay for the damage to the car. The language of the Talmud Bavli is \"בור פטור מכלים\". My question is: Why is this so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Aruch Hashulchan (CM 410:26) speculates the reason why the ditch-digger is not responsible for <em>kelim</em> as follows:</p>\n\n<p><em>Kelim</em>, in general, do not move unless a person or an animal is moving them. We expect a person to be paying enough attention where he is walking not to fall into the ditch, especially when he is carrying stuff (which is why the digger is also not responsible for human injuries). When an animal is carrying the <em>kelim</em>, we would expect it to be accompanied by its owner, who should again be paying enough attention to his possessions not to let the animal fall into the <em>bor</em> with his <em>kelim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, though, when an animal falls into the <em>bor</em>, the digger is responsible for damages to the animal itself, since when an animal is not carrying <em>kelim</em>, the owner is not as interested in looking after its safety. (Why, then, is the digger responsible for damages to the animal even if it was carrying <em>kelim</em>? Perhaps the Torah is not willing to differentiate to such a degree.)</p>\n\n<p>I would imagine that a car is classified as a <em>kli</em>. It does not have a mind of its own like an animal. It requires a person to control (move) it. Under the Aruch Hashulchan's reasoning then, when a person is driving a car, he is expected to be paying attention to the road in front of him enough not to drive into a ditch. Therefore, the digger is not responsible for the damages to the car.</p>\n\n\n",

Or is this a case of אין השואל רשאי להשאיל (\"a borrower is not permitted to lend (that which he has borrowed)\", <a href=\"http://dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=gitin&daf=29a&go=Go\">Bab.

Or am I just responsible <em>if</em> something goes wrong with the book?</li>\n<li>Would it matter if the library puts up a sign that explicitly disallows lending?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think in these types of matters, one follows the general custom. I never heard of a library caring if someone lent the book to someone else. What difference would it make to them if that happened? This is not a personal loan where Reuven lends something to Shimon but didn't give permission to give it to Levi, it is large organization that lends out books. They take your card and can charge you for the book if it is not returned, you will have to pay for it regardless of who lost it. Though if your friend loses it, you will be able to collect the money from him. </p>\n\n<p>If the library specifically disallows lending then that would prohibit it. Since we clearly can no longer assume they don't care, one must follow such conditions of the lender. It would be a sin to violate such terms. I assume it would be considered Gezeilah to misuse a borrowed item like that and perhaps one would become chayiv for certain damages to it that he would otherwise be exempt for. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The answer to the first of the four bulleted items in the question, whether the scenario is an application of <em>en hashoel rashay l'hash'il</em>, would seem to me to be obviously \"yes\". Why not?</p>\n\n<p>Ad the other three items: <em>Shach</em> 342 comments on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14400&st=&pgnum=441\" rel=\"nofollow\">the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em></a>'s \"and if he lent it to others..., he's liable\", saying that that's sometimes[1] not the case if the owner commonly lends such items to those \"others\". That the <em>Shach</em> does not choose to comment likewise on the earlier statement of the <em>SA</em>, \"A borrower may not lend\", sounds to me as though he holds that the fact that the owner commonly lends to the second potential borrower would not permit the second loan. So the answers to the question's second, third, and fourth bulleted subquestions would then be, respectively, \"it doesn't matter\", \"it's forbidden\"[2], and \"no\".</p>\n\n<p>But, of course, I may be reading too much into the <em>Shach</em>, or otherwise erring. In any event, as always, <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"nofollow\">CYLOR</a> for any practical questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] Not in any situations relevant today. (Also, the <em>SA</em>'s exemption which I elided using \"...\" would not, I think, apply to library books: it requires the first borrower to prove the book <em>mes mechamas m'lachto</em> and would have done so at his own hands also, i.e. had he not lent it.)<br>\n[2] (And you'd be liable if the book is damaged, too, per the preceding footnote.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There's another angle to consider. </p>\n\n<p>If you're done reading it (I assume you must be, since you're prepared to let your friend borrow it for the duration of your week-long book loan), then there may be others who are on a waiting list for the same book. Of course you can argue that you're not obligated to return it until it's due, so the people waiting for it have no claim, and that's true, but you might still be violating anything from Onaah (oppression - taking advantage of someone else's weakness for your or your friend's benefit) to outright theft (of someone else's time) by allowing your friend to cut in line ahead of the others.</p>\n\n<p>See Sanhedrin (32b), and 'Aruch HaShulhan (Hoshen Mishpat, 272:14) explaining that if two boats, wagons, etc. approach a passing simultaneously, they must come to an agreement as to who will pass first and the one chosen to pass first must compensate the one who has to wait.  This is based on VaYikra 19:15 \"בְּצֶדֶק, תִּשְׁפֹּט עֲמִיתֶךָ.\" (\"In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.\" - translation from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0319.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0319.htm</a>)</p>\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/business-halacha/5757/vol1no04.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torah.org/advanced/business-halacha/5757/vol1no04.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In other words, just because you have borrowed it and there's still time left until you are bound to return it, it may (heavy emphasis on \"may\") be an Isur DeOraitha (biblical prohibition) to allow someone else to borrow it, if there is someone else on a waiting list for the book.  It might not just be a minor sin of lending out property that's not yours, but a major sin of enabling someone else to benefit from a third party's harm.</p>\n\n\n",

(Then there's a lengthier stretch of time that she can't enter the Temple, but is permitted to her husband.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Skip ahead to <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus Chapter 15</a>. If a woman has a normal period (15:19) then she must abstain from her husband for seven days (counting from the start of the period), then take a ritual bath the next day, then she's fine. <strong>BUT</strong> (15:25), if the bleeding isn't \"normal\", she has to wait till it stops, then count seven clean days, then ritual bath.</p>\n\n<p>By the year 400 or so, Judaism established that we don't always know exactly what's called \"normal\" bleeding or not, so to avoid problems, <strong>any menstrual-type bleeding requires cessation, then seven clean days, then a ritual bath</strong> before she is permitted to her husband once again. This applies to childbirth as well.</p>\n\n<p>So practically today, it's end-of-bleeding (which I think is <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-normal-bleeding-and-discharge-lochia_11722.bc\" rel=\"nofollow\">usually a few weeks</a>) plus seven days, plus immersion.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is all laws aside, doctors today wouldn't recommend anything sooner than a few weeks, anyhow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Aside from the seven days for a son and fourteen days for a daughter given in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading_cdo/aid/15577\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tazria</a>, it is normal to continue to bleed for <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">weeks or even months</a> following childbirth.  One should certainly consult closely with one's rav to determine when the mother may begin counting seven clean days.  </p>\n\n<p>There is an established custom in some communities to separate for forty days following the birth of a son and for eighty days following the birth of a daughter, but there are those who condemn this custom as overly strict.  Additionally, some authorities rule that one must separate from one's wife on the night of the forty-first day following the birth of a son and the night of the eighty-first day following the birth of a daughter. (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 158:1-2)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Who in the world would feel like having intercourse only 7 days after childbirth?   Most women as sore for much longer than that, and the uterus is far from at normal size.   And most women bleed for far longer than that!\nIt's actually a misinterpretation of Leviticus.</p>\n\n<p>Orthodox Jews today follow a Talmudic law that starts the counting of days not from the actual birth, but from the first \"clean\" day after bleeding stops, so it ends up being around 6 weeks except in the case of an early miscarriage.Actual length of no-sex after childbirth = end of bleeding plus 7 days if the child was male, and end of bleeding plus 14 days for female or if gender wasn't known in the case of a miscarriage.  The 40 and 80 days are a reference to a waiting period before going to the Temple in Jerusalem, which is no longer standing.</p>\n\n\n",

(as in level 3).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Maybe others can find sources, but...</p>\n\n<p>Who is a tzaddik (in the context of this question) is a large debate. Various groups believe different things.  For example, in the Tanya, a tzadik is anyone who never has a sinful thought and never does a sinful did.  A beinoni is a person who never does a sinful deed but does have sinful thoughts, and a rasha is anyone who has ever done a sinful deed.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, a tzadik is a person who has a near perfect conception of Gd.</p>\n\n<p>According to some views of the Gemorah, a Tzadik is anyone who does perfect teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how these things relate to olam habah also varies.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemorah relates that Olam Habah is like a yeshiva class room. Those who are greater sit in the front row, and those who are not as great sit in the back row.  How many rows close to the front counts as a tzadik to eat the Leviathon, is not so clear.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Tanya, (I  believe) each sin a person does creates a black thread in their clothing, and a black brick in their store hourse. Each mitzvah, creates a white thread and a white brick. So the Tzadikim would be all of those who have only white clothes and white store houses. (The store houses contain the rewards for their mitzvot, while the clothes provide social reward)</p>\n\n<p>Now, according to the Rambam, none of the above applies.</p>\n\n<p>According to all opinions, I believe, you have at least 2 classes of people in Olam haba, those who are great and those who are less great.  (Based on the vision of a Tanna that went to Heaven and saw that olam habah was all mixed up. Those who were well respected in this world were nothing in the world to come, and those who were ignored in this world were giants in the world to come.)  It seems, also that there might be 'beinoni' castes within Olam habah based on this view.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, also according to all opinions you have 4 classes of people.  1. Those who never make it to Olam Habah.  2. Those who make it to olam habah as part of the Jewish people.  3. Those who make it to Olam habah based on their merits.  4. Those who would not make it to olam habah on their own, but do make it to olam habah based on the merits of their descendants.</p>\n\n<p>Those who eat of the leviathan, would be the greatest of those who make it to Olam habah. Though some also say (don't remember who) that everyone who makes it to Olam habah gets to partake of the feast in the days of Moshiach and techayet matim.</p>\n\n\n",

And it's an important emotional statement; and a nice reminder about the couple sharing (and their parents pulling back so the couple can be a couple!) and not sheltering assets. But a lot of it was because people were used to having some sort of <em>Tnaim</em> document; once they were going to have one, this formulation made the most sense for the way it was being used.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>T'naim directly before the chuppah serves the exact same function as T'naim a year/month/day/century before the chupah.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why a T'naim is done so close to the chuppah (in some circles) is so that there is little to no chance of the T'naim being broken.

    "content": "# Gender Choice in Halacha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it Halachicly allowed to chose the gender of your child or does Halacha frown upon this practice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>They can do changes in diet or <em>segulahs</em> to their heart's content. (Though they may speak with a rabbi if that's a spiritually wise idea.) Anything more medicalized than that is probably a bad idea in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Barry Freundel spoke about this at a medical ethics conference around 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose a couple has IVF, for whatever reason; let's assume there is some serious hereditary disease they can test for, so they have a big bunch of embryos, and they test them (some are healthy, some have the disease) before picking one or two (or three) to implant. Judaism says that the remaining embryos can be discarded, they don't have sanctity of life. (As ruled by Rabbi Elyashiv.) Rabbi Elyashiv was asked, \"can you pick out only the male (or female) ones?\" He replied -- \"if you can throw them all away, then you can pick whatever you want!\"</p>\n\n<p>But this concerns a couple who needed IVF for some significant reason (infertility otherwise, or avoiding some horrible disease). IVF is complicated and exhausting enough that I strongly doubt anyone would do it just for the sake of picking gender.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Freundel explained that just about any technique in fertility medicine today is halachically complicated in some way; now many of them are allowed for various needs, most commonly the pain we feel for the childless couple. But \"oh how horrible, the Goldsteins only have girls\" just doesn't ring true the same way. If there was a pill that a man could take that would cause him to only create XY (or only XX) sperm for the next few days, fine we could talk about it; but any other method today has halachic costs without halachic benefit. (Well some think changes in diet and exercise can influence things; if that works, sure fine. The question is serious medical intervention.)</p>\n\n<p>There may be a specific situation where there actually is emotional strain on the couple to produce a boy; that's a different story. But generally, \"you get what you get and you don't get upset.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Freundel argued convincingly that it's erroneous to say \"oh it's a good idea to use medical interventions to pick gender, as the fulfilment of <em>Peru Urvu</em> is done by having a boy and a girl. It's unclear whether one fulfils Peru Urvu with artificial insemination (let alone IVF) anyhow; and more significantly, the only obligation of Peru Urvu is to marry someon who appears to be fertile, and then to go about normal life. The Talmud is full of recommended practices to better your odds towards having a boy (some of which may be \"to better your odds of having the gender you prefer\"); yet nowhere does it say that any of these <em>segulahs</em> should be reversed or halted if you have a bunch of sons but no daughters. Why? Because <em>Peru Urvu</em> doesn't ask that of you.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Organized prayer in the synagogue with less than 10 people - community or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5727/saying-yekum-purkan-after-the-minyan-is-already-up-to-av-harachamim-or-ashrei\">this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are parts of prayer that are not said when praying alone.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples (please add any I missed):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Friday Night: Birchat Me-in Sheva</p></li>\n<li><p>Shabbos Day before Mussaf: Yekum Purkan, Mi Sheberach</p></li>\n<li><p>Kaddish, Barchu, Torah reading, Chazarat Ha-Shatz (Repetition of the Amida)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When praying in the synagogue at the scheduled time together with less than 10 people (in other words not enough people showed up to make the Minyan), do you say these prayers or not. Each of those prayers have a communal aspect. Is this considered enough of a community to say the prayers or not?</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sefer-haminhagim/11.htm#t77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Chabad custom is</a> that an individual says the Shema Prayer, he repeats <em>ani Hashem Elokeichem</em>. When praying with a Minyan, the chazan repeats <em>\"Hashem Elokeichem emes\"</em>. When leading a service with less than 10 men, how does the chazan finish off the Shema? This same question would apply to congregations who have the custom to say <em>\"kel melech neeman\"</em> before Sh'ma if praying alone whereas the chazan repeats <em>\"Hashem elokechem emes\"</em> when praying with a minyan. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I'm a bit perplexed by the question (see my comment to the question), but here are some points to consider: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><del>when an individual prays, angels carry his prayers up to the heavens. According to the Gemora, <a href=\"http://Sota_36a\" rel=\"nofollow\">angels don't understand Aramaic</a>. Now, when there is a minyan, <a href=\"http://brachos_6a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hashem himself is present</a>. Hence, there are many tefilos that are in Aramaic (such as Yekum Purkan) that we only say when there is a Minyan. For more on this concept, see <a href=\"http://www.halachabrura.org/dafyomi/sota5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></del> <br>\n<strong>UPDATE</strong>: the above isn't as clear cut as it seems and is a Machlokes at best. Another reason that Yekum Purkan isn't said without a minyan is because it's a brocha/tefillah for the tzibur, and if there is no tzibur - there is no one to daven for! (The first Yekum Purkan is for individual Rabanim/leaders of the generation and hence an individual can say it)</li>\n<li>Mi Shebarach recited after reading the Torah is an oxymoron - you don't read the Torah with less than a Minyan. In general, I don't believe there is an issue with saying a Mi Sheberach without a minyan, and I believe the Sefardi Rabonim often gives berochos in the form of a Mi Sheberach,</li>\n<li>Birchas Me-in Sheva is an abridged form of Chazoras Hashatz, and hence the logic should follow that it requires a Minyan</li>\n<li>Hashem Elokeichem Emes - the reason for repeating that is because there are x-3 amount of words in Shema, corresponding of limbs (or something like that). Hence, we add three words to make up the difference. An apointed Shliach Tzibur can be \"motzeh\" us with that. As per my comment, I'm not familiar with a Shliach Tzibur sans a minyan.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To summarize: in the absence of a quorum you don't say prayers that require one, <del>you don't say any prayers in Aramaic (even though, as per the link above, it might be acceptable for an individual to pray in the language of his choice)</del></p>\n\n\n",

But as far as the last part of the question, it should be possible to rely on it if the company is known to be reputable and follow religious norms.  In general we say 'Eid Ehad NeEman BeIsurin (\"one witness is believed in (matters of) prohibitions\").  Thus, technically, if the producer of the food is an upstanding, religious person, he can be relied upon to state that his food is Kosher.  The only reason we have come to rely on outside agencies is that there have been cases in which one's interest in his own product has compromised his believability with regard to the Kashruth of the product.  Since the Berachah is not part of what helps the company sell the product (as opposed to its being Kosher), I would trust the label unless I either know otherwise or suspect that they are not reliably educated enough to make such a claim (not that I would suspect them of deliberately misleading me, as I might if it were a Kashruth claim designed to help sell the prodcut).</p>\n\n\n",

The Holy One said: Since she shunned transgression, go and set her among the seven stars yonder.

Shemhazai saw a maiden named Istehar, and he lost his heart to her. She promised to surrender herself to him, if first he taught her the Ineffable Name, by means of which he raised himself to heaven. He assented to her condition. But once she knew it, she pronounced the Name, and herself ascended to heaven, without fulfilling her promise to the angel. God said, \"Because she kept herself aloof from sin, we will place her among the seven stars, that men may never forget her,\" and she was put in the constellation of the Pleiades.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, there is a connection to a Greek legend:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Istahar's story is borrowed partly from the Greek writer Aratus (early third century B.C.). He tells how Justice, a daughter of Dawn, ruled mankind virtuously in the Golden Age; but when the Silver and Bronze ages brought greed and slaugter among them, she exclaimed: \"Alas, for this evil race!\" and mounted into Heaven, where she became the constellation Virgo. The rest of this story is borrowed from Apollodorus's account of Orion's attempt on the seven virgin Pleadies, daugters of Atlas and Pleione, who escaped his embraces transformed into stars. \"Istahar,\" however, is the Babylonian Goddess Ishtar, sometimes identified with Virgo. Popular Egyptian belief identified Orion, the constellation which became Shemhazai, with the sould of Osiris.\" (The Sons of God and the Daughters of Men, From Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis, written by Robert Graves and Raphael Patai)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Read more there.

    "content": "# Does a fathers obligation to teach his sons a parnassah extend to his daughters too?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A father has an obligation to teach his sons Torah, a parnassah and to swim. To what extent do these obligations extend to his daughters too?</p>\n\n<p>(edited to include my explanation from the comments)<br>\nAs Ariel mentions in his answer, Gemara Kiddushin 29-30 discusses the 6 obligations a father has to his sons. </p>\n\n<p>1 Bris, \n2 Redeem the firstborn, \n3 Teach him Torah, \n4 find a wife for him, \n5 teach him a parnassah, \n6 (some say) to teach him to swim</p>\n\n<p>1 and 2 necessarily apply only to sons not daughters. \nWe learn from a pasuk that 3 applies only to sons not daughters. \n4 applies to both sons and daughters (although in different ways). \n6 is learned from the logic that his life may depend upon it, given that I don't see any reasonable way you could say that this shouldn't apply just as much to daughters as to sons. You can't really say that maybe at some future time your son might drown if he doesn't know how to swim, but if your daughter drowns that's OK. </p>\n\n<p>The real question seems to me to be by Parnassah. The Gemara doesn't make clear whether or not this applies to daughters as well as sons. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara brings two reasons. In the first Chizkiyah shows a Pasuk that compares livelihood to getting married. So just as a Father has an obligation to see his son married, so to does he have an obligation to teach him a Parnassah. This would imply that this would apply to daughters too, since the Pasuk on marrying off your children explicitly includes daughters. </p>\n\n<p>The second reason the Gemara gives for the requirement to teach your son a Parnassah is to compare it to the obligation to teach Torah. This would imply that the obligation would only extend to sons and not to daughters since the pasuk for teaching Torah excludes daughters. </p>\n\n<p>Based only on my own reasoning, I would think that this obligation would mean that you should teach your children what they need to know to survive in the society that they are in. If they live in a society where women normally cook and sew and such then you should make sure that they learn this. If they live in a society where the wife will be expected to earn a living with a job outside the home then I would think that Rabbi Yehudah's rule that not teaching a trade is teaching to be a thief would apply. I want to make clear that I have no source for this. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are 6 Mitzvos on the father to teach his son and they are discussed in Meseches Kiddushin (29-30).The mitzvah to teach one's son Torah is a Biblical command, but it only applies to sons (the passuk says \"b'neichem\"). The mitzvah to teach a parnassah seems to be a rabbinic command, and also only applies to sons. In the past, the men earned a living while the women normally stayed at home. So it was not necessary for a woman to earn a living, since she would be supported by her husband. There's a machlokes if there's a mitzvha to teach one's son to swim. I would assume that it would also only apply to sons, just like the other mitzvos there. Probably they were more likely to be near water, e.g. if they went on a business trip.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The posak says- כל־כבודה בת־מלך פנימה woman need to stay home not going to work.\n<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94%3a%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thelim</a></p>\n\n\n",

According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.28a.5?lang=bi&p2=Ran_on_Nedarim.28a.5.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran in Nedarim 28a</a>, \"paying taxes is like paying rent, it is the cost you pay for living in that country.\" (see also the Rama in Choshen Mishpat <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.369.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">369:6</a>).  Rabbi Joseph Solovechik also held that one should not shop at a store where you know the owner does not pay taxes because you are being lifnei iver (assisting him to sin).  </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there are many people, rabbis included, who hold that dina d'malchusa dina applies only to financial laws.  That argument, more or less, coincides with the Mechaber who says that dina d’malchusa dina is limited to government interests. </p>\n\n<p>The Rama disagrees and says that it applies to anything that is designed to promote the well being of society. According to <a href=\"http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliyahu Fink</a>, most poskim agree with this definition which includes but is not limited to, criminal law, minimum wage laws, environmental laws and child labor laws.  My Rav, Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer, zt'l, held that secular laws designed to keep people safe -- e.g. traffic laws -- are especially important to observe.  Crossing against the light, for example, was not only illegal under Jewish law by application of dina d'malchusa dina, Rabbi Anemer told me, but the act might be a hillul Hashem if observed by non-Jews as it appears to demonstrate Jewish contempt for the civil laws.  That issue was especially personal for Rabbi Anemer who lost his brother, sister-in-law and their entire family in a car crash eruv Pesach in 1957.</p>\n\n\n",

Well, a sukkah is, for us Jews, a normal residential purpose for the week of Sukkos (indeed, halachah considers the sukkah fully the equivalent of a normal house for purposes of civil law - see Sukkah 31a). One presumes, then, that the Communists would have had no particular objection to someone putting up a hut in their back yard just for relaxation or storage or whatever; the fact that they prohibited doing so for religious purposes is, of course, outside of the scope of <em>dina d'malchusa dina</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't think halachicly it would be considered in the possession of the people, so therefore it would not be reshus harabim.</p>\n\n<p>And the reasoning given is that it's stolen if the government steals from you and you ignore them. But that wouldn't be stolen property —  maybe it would be considered \"aino bershuso\" which isn't a problem by succah.</p>\n\n<p>As for dina demalchusah dina, that shouldn't apply to something like this because it would be similar to a situation where the government decides that one who spits on his fellow has to compensate him by transferring ownership of the spitter's house to the one he spit on, or other ridiculous laws.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2005/rsch_taxes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2005/rsch_taxes.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

At the same time, I recall once hearing a shiur that there is actually a difference between my 2 modern-day examples and the Gemara's case.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal experience, I have noticed that most people tend to not blatantly speak, and instead rely on various hand-motions (and/or quick one-word phrases [generally in Hebrew, although I'm not sure what that accomplishes]) to get others to attend to their needs. Which would suggest that such behavior is not permissible.</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate if someone could enlighten me...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>It is definitely allowed.</p>\n\n<p>The custom not to speak between washing and hamotzi is nowhere near as strict as the requirement not to speak between hamotzi and eating the bread.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Brachot (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E_%D7%90\">40a</a>) that you remember permits you to speak <em>between hamotzi and eating</em> for essential purposes (\"take some bread,\" \"bring salt/seasoning,\" \"feed the animals\").</p>\n\n<p>By the obvious kal vachomer, saying those things before hamotzi is permissible.</p>\n\n<p>I can't speak to the shiur that you heard.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding what people do, my understanding is that it's a personal or communal practice, based on not knowing this Gemara. (It's not strictly a chumra, because generally people don't realize they're being unnecessarily strict.)  Speaking in Hebrew is similarly just something people do; according to the poskim the language makes no difference.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As the Baal HaTanya writes in Shulchan Aruch Harav (166:1):</p>\n\n<p>\"But if one is sitting and not doing any action that would distract him from hamotzei, even though he is waiting for a long time, and even if he converses a little, there is no concern since the table is set in front of him and his intention is to eat; that he can converse is on the condition that he doesn't get into a heated argument which will distract him from eating; and therefore it is permissible to make kiddush or havdalah between washing and hamotzei, and the whole idea of going immediately from washing to the blessing applies only to mayim achronim and bentching.\"</p>\n\n<p>אבל אם יושב בטל ואינו עושה בינתיים שום מעשה שיש בו היסח הדעת אף על פי ששוהה הרבהט ואפילו משיח מעט אין לחושי כיון שהשולחן לפניו ודעתו לאכוליא ובלבד שלא יפליג בדברים שלא יבא לידי היסח הדעתיב ולכן מותר לומר קידוש והבדלה בין נטילת ידים להמוציאיג ולא אמרו תיכף לנטילת ידים ברכהיד אלא במים אחרונים בלבד</p>\n\n<p>The Baal HaTanya then quotes a second opinion that says it applies also to mayim rishonim, and concludes that it is \"good\" to be careful according to the second opinion. But clearly, according to the letter of the law, the first view is correct. And that is why he proceeds to write that speaking a few short words or answering yes or no is certainly fine in any case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>To build upon <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9855/can-i-wash-and-say-please-pass-the-salt/9860#9860\">JXG's answer</a>, the Halachah is clearly that you are not allowed to speak unnecessarily in between Berachoth and that for which the Berachah was recited. On the other hand, one may speak in between two separate actions that each have their Berachoth, even if one action is related to the other and speaking is to be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Case #1: Like most Birchoth Mitzvah, if one needs (NEEDS) to speak for some reason in between washing one's hands and saying 'Al Netilath Yadayim (not HaMotzi; I'll get to that soon), then that is permissible. Otherwise, it is a Hefsek, and he must wash again before making the Berachah. (Also, note that I am using the word \"wash\" to include the entire enterprise of washing, raising one's hands and drying them, as the Berachah is recited on the entire process, not just the water being poured over the hands. If one speaks in between washing and drying, and he has not yet recited the Berachah, then he may not need to re-wash, because the Berachah may be recited on the drying; however one should still refrain from speaking once the first hand is washed.)</p>\n\n<p>Case #2 (the case of the Gemara, if I'm not mistaken - if I am, someone please correct me!): If one needs (NEEDS!) to speak for some reason in between SAYING HAMOTZI AND EATING THE BREAD, normally we are trained early on when learning Berachoth that we may not speak between the Berachah and eating, but, as above in case #1, one MAY speak if it is necessary for some reason and for the purpose of the blessing/eating. Again, and this cannot be emphasized enough, it must be because of a real NEED.  Otherwise it is a Hefsek and one would have to make a new Berachah (of HaMotzi - one need not wash again in most cases).</p>\n\n<p>Case #3 (the case in the question, and the case with which most people are familiar at many a Shabbath/Yom Tov table, especially with little kids): In between \"washing\" (again, the entire process - and this time I'm also assuming the Berachah on the \"washing\" process was recited appropriately) and \"HaMotzi\" (ie., the recitation of the Berachah - I'm assuming that nobody in this case is planning on talking between the Berachah of HaMotzi and actually eating the bread), it is PREFERABLE that one limit his talking, because the washing was FOR the bread.  However, the rules of Hefsek are much more relaxed in this case.  The point is that one should still have in mind from the point of washing until HaMotzi that the former is for the latter.  If one speaks, but it does not distract from this thought, it is entirely fine.  If, however, one gesticulates and carries on an entire conversation without proper words and plays mime games (and I've actually witnessed this sort of carrying on going to extreme levels, all without a word being spoken), then one has very likely distracted oneself with his own silliness and lost track of the fact that one just washed for bread, and it would seem to me that one has crossed the line to where one ought to wash again, although I don't think one needs a new Berachah on the washing except in extreme cases.</p>\n\n<p>However, in none of the above cases does it make one iota of difference whether one spoke in English, Hebrew, Yiddish, Arabic, French, Swahili, or any other language.</p>\n\n<p>\"See Mishna Berura 165:7 and 166:2. The Shulchan Aruch HaRav  166:1 and some other Poskim maintain that saying two  or three words such as \"yes please\" or \"Of course not\" are not considered a Hefsek and are permitted.\"  (Sources and quote drawn from here: <a href=\"http://halachafortoday.com/archivesnetilasyadayim.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://halachafortoday.com/archivesnetilasyadayim.aspx</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

Isn't once enough?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The basic idea is that the first splash of water becomes tamei from touching your hands (since they themselves are deemed tamei - that's the reason we have to wash in the first place); the second splash, then, makes the water left on your hands tahor. If your hands were dirty, you actually need three splashes: one to remove the dirt, and the second and third serve as the necessary two splashes.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=109\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 162:2 and Mishnah Berurah there</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Actually, the Shulchan Aruch in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=109\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 162:2</a> (agreed upon by the Rama) rules that you need to splash once per hand plus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>one more splash if you are pouring less that a revi'it (86.4 mL) per splash in which case you need to splash twice per hand: once for the washing and once to remove the tamei water. (If you used a full revi'it than the water never becomes tamei from the hands.)</p></li>\n<li><p>one more non-primary splash at the beginning if you have dirt on your hands, in which case you splash an extra time first to wash off the dirt.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I find that when using less than 86.4 mL per hand it is exceedingly difficult to cover the entire hand with the water. Additionally, a standard washing cup holds about a liter (about 12 revi'its) so the vast majority of people do not need a second splash the way we are accustomed to washing.</p>\n\n<p>I note that the Mishna Berura there (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=110\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sk 21</a>) notes that it is possible that the Gra holds like the Rashba who requires two splashes always, but the Mishna Berurah agrees that the majority opinion is as I quoted above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>The halachic reason, as brought in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (O.C. 162:2) and explained by the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>, is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first pour removes ritual impurity (<em>tumah</em>) from the hands.</li>\n<li>However, that water itself becomes impure.</li>\n<li>The second pour washes away the now-impure water, leaving the hands fully <em>tahor</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If one pours a <strong>full <em>revi’it</em> (approximately 75–86 ml)</strong> on each hand in a single pour, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> rules that this may suffice. However, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> cites the view of the Gra (based on the Rashba) that two pours are always required, and this stricter practice is widely followed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>What is the goal of the washing — purity or cleanliness?</strong></p>\n<p>The Gemara debates <em>why</em> we wash hands before eating bread. Several explanations are offered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>gezeirah</strong> to remind Kohanim to be careful when eating <em>terumah</em>,</li>\n<li>The removal of a <strong>rabbinically decreed impurity</strong> specific to hands (which are constantly busy),</li>\n<li>And a general concern for <strong>physical cleanliness</strong> and sanctity in eating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This debate may explain why halacha emphasizes a method that satisfies all three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ritual purity</strong>: Achieved through the two pours that remove <em>tumah</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical cleanliness</strong>: Seen in customs like an initial wash to remove dirt and ensuring water covers the entire hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this sense, the halachic procedure may have been structured to <strong>cover all bases</strong> for the various reasons behind the mitzvah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Why not just one pour practically?</strong></p>\n<p>As a personal observation, I would suggest that practical concerns — such as ensuring that water reaches both sides of the hand — may have influenced or reinforced the practice of pouring twice. This isn’t cited explicitly in classical sources, but it aligns with the physical logic of the act.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, when you purify a mixture through removing the unwanted, that is a method that is normally used for storage, not eating.</p>\n\n<p>When you remove the wanted substance from the unwanted with a \"purifying instrument\", like your pitcher, you have purified using an eating method with one exception:  \"Purifying instruments\" are used for storage, not eating.  But in halacha, you are deemed to have used that instrument only if it was practically functional.</p>\n\n<p>The Rema ( <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=282\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 319:10</a>)paskens that one may purify water from impurities using a strainer since most would drink the water with the impurities (with a possible exception to an istanis acc. to Biur Halacha).  Although I would assume manual removal of the impurities from the water would be borer, the instrument cannot be said to be functioning in a halachic sense since the water is already \"pure\".  (It's a fine split, but makes sense.)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a posek told me that I may use a salad spinner o Shabbos for a different reason in addition to the Rema.  As a senif lehakel, R' Moshe held that a purifying instrument is specifically where it is doing a job which cannot be done manually.  The salad may be dried by waving it back and forth.  The same is true for the ice water.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, this pitcher is not a functioning kli borer as implied by the halacha.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your beverage question, you would have to post more detail.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Stipulations based on \"correct\" halacha vs. \"לא בשמים היא\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is my understanding that halacha is determined by individual <em>p'sak</em>. That is, there is no divine body of halacha which we are trying to determine with <em>poskim</em> issuing their <em>p'sak</em> based on what they think \"God would <em>pasken</em>\". Rather, a person's halachic obligations are defined by his perosnal rav's <em>p'sak</em>, and nothing else. This is my understanding of \"לא בשמים היא\".</p>\n\n<p>In view of this, I find it difficult to understand a certain halachic phenomenon which I have seen in several instances. When there is a difference of opinion among the halachic authorities as to one's halachic obligation, sometimes the Mishna Berura or the like will advise that one make a stipulation based on what is the \"correct\" halachic opinion.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there is a <em>machlokes</em> whether or not to say the <em>maariv sh'mone esre</em> twice after forgetting <em>yaaleh v'yavo</em> during <em>mincha</em> of <em>rosh chodesh</em> if it is no longer <em>rosh chodesh</em> that night. Mishna B'rura's advice is to say <em>sh'mone esre</em> again with the following <em>t'nai</em>: \"If I am halachically obligated to repeat the <em>amida</em>, then let this repetition satisfy my obligation. If not, let this be simply a <em>t'fillas n'dava</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>I have seen the same advice given for whether to say <em>shema</em> before the <em>z'man</em> of the Magen Avraham, if one will be able to say it during <em>shacharis</em> with a minyan before the later <em>z'man</em> of the Gra. \"If the halacha follows Magen Avraham, let me be <em>yotzei</em> with this recitation. If the halacha follows the Gra, let this be simply <em>talmud torah</em>, and I'll be <em>yotzei</em> with my later recitation.\"</p>\n\n<p>But I don't get it. What does it mean \"If the halacha follows X\"? Go to your rav and get a <em>p'sak</em>. If he <em>paskens</em> to follow X, then by definition, that is the halacha for you. It sounds like the idea is \"If God would <em>pasken</em> like X...\". But that conflicts with my understanding of the halachic process.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: How is the condition of such a <em>t'nai</em> as above not paradoxical? How can a stipulation of the form \"If halacha follows X... If halacha follows Y...\" be reconciled with the idea of \"לא בשמים היא\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Lo Bashmayim means that when your Rav gives you a Psak and you hear a Bas Kol saying otherwise, you should follow your Rav and not the Bas Kol. However there are areas in Halacha where there is no clear Psak as there is a Machlokes between compentent Rabbi's who were or currently are on this world. Since there is no clear Psak we try to saitsfy all Shitos when possible. If your Rav tells you that if you say Kriyas Shema by the Gra's Zeman then it is fine for you to do so, however some Rabanim feel that you should try to make it by the Magain Avraham's Zeman as the Magain Avraham was a reliable authority.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"Lo BeShamaim Hee\" tells us that the Heavenly Court cannot decide the law (without the Earthly Court agreeing). The rules of Torah stipulate that it is the Rabbis down here who decide the laws. There is a famous story in the Talmud (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/babamezia/babamezia_59.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baba Metzia 59B</a>) That illustrates this point. Here's a quote from that story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: 'It is not in heaven.' What did he mean by this? — Said R. Jeremiah: That the Torah had\n  already been given at Mount Sinai; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice, because Thou hast long\n  since written in the Torah at Mount Sinai, After the majority must one incline. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there are rules to how the Earthly Court makes decisions. One such rule (as explained in the Mishna (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h47.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ediot 1:5</a>). Is that in order for a later court to overturn the decision of an earlier court, that later court must be greater in number and in wisdom. Because of a concept in Torah Law called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeridat_ha-dorot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeridat HaDorot (the decline of the generations)</a>, later Courts of Jewish Law would generally (I'm sure there must have been some exceptions, e.g <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_Arika#Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Tanna Hu Upalig</a>) not consider themselves worthy of overturning the rulings of the earlier generations.</p>\n\n<p>To be more precise, Rabbis from different time periods fall into different eras, and as a rule, later eras cannot argue with earlier eras, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeridat_ha-dorot#Eras_of_Rabbinic_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, Rabbis in the Mishna may argue with each other (even if they lived in different generations), but a Rabbi in the Talmud could not argue with an opinion brought in the Mishna, unless he could prove that he was basing his opinion on another Rabbi in the Mishna, who himself argued with the first Mishnaic Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true for the Halachic Rulers of the later era (Achronim). They generally try not to argue with the Halachic Rulers of earlier era (Rishonim), although they do, when making a ruling, choose to rule like one over the other, using different criteria to make that choice.</p>\n\n<p>[Incidentally, this is where the idea of LeChatchila and BeDiEved come into play. It is basically the Rabbis saying that the Halacha is like so-and-so, and that's what you should ideally do. If you already did it the other way however, you have a Rabbi you can rely on. Alternatively, the Rabbis are saying if you do it this way you will fulfill  your obligation according to all authorities, so the ideal thing is to do it that way. If you did it another way, you may have still fulfilled your obligation according to certain opinions]</p>\n\n<p>These days, a Rav cannot innovate Halacha if it goes against what was ruled in earlier eras. He must rely on the writings of earlier eras when formulating his Halachic ruling (he can however, interpret those writings in novel ways, as long as his interpretation is Halachically sound). As such, when faced with a halachic inquiry, the Rav can't just tell you what he thinks, he must look in the sources. There are times when there are different opinions in the sources that don't have a clear-cut resolution. It is times like this that Rav will tell you to try to do what needs to be done in a way that will fulfill all opinions, if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Ruling that way doesn't go against Torah Lo BeShamayim Hee, since the doubt is not in Heaven but down here on earth, amongst the Rabbis.</p>\n\n\n",

Elsewhere (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0325.htm#9\">Lev. 25:9</a>) the Torah puts the verb <em>haavir</em> (\"to make pass\") before and after references to a teruah, implying that it should be preceded and followed by a long drawn-out sound - which tells us that the basic order is tekiah-teruah-tekiah.</p>\n\n<p>So there's no doubt what a tekiah is. However, the word \"teruah\" is translated in Aramaic as \"yevava,\" which means a crying sound, and there are three possibilities what this means: moaning (medium-length sounds, what we call \"shevarim\"); sobbing (short sounds, what we call \"teruah\"); or both, first moaning and then sobbing. Already in the era of the Mishnah there was uncertainty which of these three is the true \"teruah\"; accordingly, it was instituted that we do all three.</p>\n\n<p>(Talmud, Rosh Hashanah <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=1351&size=1\">33b</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=1352&size=1\">34a</a>; Shulchan Aruch Harav, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25075&pgnum=224\">Orach Chaim 590:1-2</a>)</p>\n\n<p>[How this uncertainty came about is itself the subject of dispute. R. Hai Gaon explains that in reality, any of these three would satisfy the Torah obligation of hearing a crying sound, so various communities did it in various ways; the enactment to do all three was in order to unify the various practices. By contrast, Rambam writes (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3603.htm#2\">Shofar 3:2</a>) that the true original meaning of \"teruah\" was actually forgotten, and so we do all three to be on the safe side.]</p>\n\n<p>Returning to tekiah, it can be drawn out as long as you want (Shulchan Aruch Harav, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25075&pgnum=225\">Orach Chaim 590:4</a>). So the custom developed to make the last one (of the first set of 30 sounds) extra-long (\"tekiah gedolah\"), also symbolizing the idea (from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2647.htm#6\">Ps. 47:6</a>) that G-d's presence \"ascends with the sound of the shofar.\" But it's not a halachic requirement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Digging around I found the following <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/jh/parasha/eng/rosh/fis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">dvar torah by Prof. A. Harel Fisch on Bar-Ilan's website</a> regarding a passage from S.Y. Agnon's Days of Awe (Hebrew edition; the English translation is an abridgment) pp. 108-110:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first round of blowing the <em>shofar</em>, we sound <em>tekiah-shevarim-teru'ah</em> and the last <em>tekiah</em> is not part of this round, but the Rabbis of blessed Memory enacted that one should sound a <em>teruah</em> (succession of tremulous notes), with a simple blast (<em>tekiah</em>) before it and a simple blast after it. The first <em>tekiah</em> is of the essence, the second, a rabbinic enactment. A <em>tekiah</em> is a plain, straight sound, as I have said--the sound that comes out and travels, piercing the air, until it reaches our patriarch Abraham of blessed memory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prof. Fisch continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Later Agnon characterizes each of the three sounds of the shofar: \"The <em>tekiah</em> stands for the totally righteous...\" (based on <em>Midrash Yehi Or</em> in <em>Menorat ha-Maor Zohar</em>, also cf. <em>Emor</em> 98). According to this, the plain blast (which precedes the tremulous note) is really essential. This is the simple sound, corresponding to the horn of the wild goat and symbolic of a person whose reasoning is straight and who does not bow over. Next we sound the tremulous note of the person who bends his reason and casts himself down; the latter is symbolized by the curved horn of the ram. These sources cited in Agnon's book support the first <em>tanna</em> mentioned in the <em>Mishnah</em>, and give preference to the <em>tekiah</em>, the simple sound that symbolizes the totally righteous. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If anyone has the book, I'd love to see more.</p>\n\n\n",

That way, a person could be sure to cover all of the different meanings of the sounds and properly complement that awareness with awareness of the adjacent service.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone ever written a list of such assignments, so that I could look at it at each part of the service and have a good idea of what to think about right then?

Hence a person is exempted from mitzva obligations if they lack the cognitive ability needed for their most basic performance. I very much doubt that was the case in the incident you described; and I hope that individual is getting the help he needs (it seems he's crying out for it).</p>\n<p>There is the famous, famous responsum of the Chasam Sofer (or was it one of his descendants?) about institutionalizing an individual such that only non-kosher food will be available, with the goal of increasing their ability to function. Rabbi JD Bleich proves conclusively (<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">yutorah</a> mp3 available) that the case concerned a developmentally challenged individual (who is obligated in most mitzvas), not a severely insane one (who is not).</p>\n<p>After using the term <em>shoteh</em> (exempt from mitzva obligation) 50-something times in his code, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e209.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam then writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ט,ט  [י] הפתיים ביותר שאינן מכירין דברים הסותרין זה את זה, ולא יבינו ענייני הדבר כדרך שמבינין שאר עם הארץ, וכן המבוהלין והנחפזין בדעתם, והמשתגעים בדעתן ביותר--הרי כל אלו בכלל השוטים.  ודבר זה, לפי מה שיראה הדיין, שאי אפשר לכוון הדעות בכתב.</p>\n<p>The exceedingly simple, who cannot understand that both A and B cannot be true as they conflict with one another, are considered <em>shoteh</em> and therefore disqualified from serving as witnesses ... and such matters must be judged individually by the judge and can't fit an easy written criterion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein says that for the first 50-something uses of <em>shoteh</em> (which are all about his mitzva obligations in general), Rambam didn't have to define it -- it meant someone who <em>you know it when you see it</em>, someone completely crazy and disconnected from reality. It was only with regards to serving as a witness that the severely developmentally challenged is excluded.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Someone with Downs who cannot understand the mitzvah in question would be a pesi. A shoteh is someone incapable of choosing right over wrong. The Rambam may have blamed that on an inability to comprehend, but more modern psychological theories would attribute it to impulse control, an inability to relate to consequences, and psychiatric rather than intellectual issues.</p>\n\n<p>(I wouldn't use the Rambam's definition, because Aristo got psychology wrong. We no longer think that right vs wrong decisions depend on knowledge. The Rambam clearly did.)</p>\n\n<p>There is a question where pesi fits in to the classical \"cheireish, shoteh, veqatan\". The better-known idea is that a pesi is a shoteh despite the difference in cause. Someone with Downs knows right from wrong; it's a question of which details of the halakhah he can be taught. R' Herschel Schachter made a strong argument that a pesi is actually a cheireish, even if he is able to both hear and speak. Today's deaf mute is not considered a cheireish because he is educable, thus showing that a cheireish is exempt for reasons of educability. Which someone who has intellectual limitations does as well.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, someone with Downs who can explain that he's a shoteh and thus allegedly exempt isn't really handicapped enough to be exempt from anything.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Shmuel Singer in his book \"A Parent's Guide to Teaching Children Mitzvot: A Halakhic Guide\" with the Haskama of Rav Hershel Schechter writes: (on page <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=55NdTR7HfYAC&pg=PA143\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">143</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Modern poskim agree that if a special child <strong>has the potential to achieve the intellectual level of an average six-year-old</strong>...<br>\n  Upon reaching bar or bat mitzvah such a child will be obligated to observe all the mitzvot just as an ordinary Jewish adult must.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>his source is (footnote 23 on page <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=55NdTR7HfYAC&pg=PA149\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">149</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Minchas Shlomo, siman <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15096&st=&pgnum=243\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34</a> and Tshuvos Hagoen Rav Moshe Feinstein in the booklet Am HaTorah <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15064&st=&pgnum=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2.2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so it seems it depends on the degree of potential intelligence of this Down Syndrome individual (society calling him a Shote does not make it so, since they often do so to intelligent individuals)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does there seem to be different standards for future sinners?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/b04r.html#fn382\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereshit (21:17)</a> Rashi tells us that the Angels wanted G-d to kill Yishmael, but G-d said that He wouldn't judge him according to his future deeds, but rather according to his present state:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>In the place where he is.</strong> [I.e.,] he is judged according to his present deeds and not according to what he will do in the future. For the angels were declaiming against [him] and saying, \"Master of the universe, for one whose descendants will eventually kill your children with thirst You will provide for him a well?\" And He responds to them, \"But, what is he now, righteous or wicked?\" They respond to Him: \"He is righteous.\" [Whereupon] He responds to them: \"It is according to his present deeds that I judge him.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=1317&size=2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 16B</a>) uses this story to teach us that a person is only judged according to his present deeds (at the time he is being judged).</p>\n<p>But in (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3812&size=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 101B</a>), Rashi quotes a Midrash that tells us as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moshe told G-d, \"You have done bad to this nation, because now if they don't have bricks [the Egyptians] put the children of the Jews in the building [in place of the bricks].\"</p>\n<p>G-d responded to Moshe, \"They are destroying thorns [i.e. people of no value]. I know that if they would live they would be wicked <em>(another version: completely wicked)</em>. If you want, you can test me and remove one of the children.\"</p>\n<p>Moshe saved a child and it was Micha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Micha is said by some to have been the one to create the Golden Calf, and is said by others to be the same Micha who made the \"Pesel Micha\" at the end of the Book of Judges - see <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=557&letter=M\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Here we have a child who is completely blameless, yet G-d wants to kill him because of his future sins. Why does this differ from Yishmael?</strong></p>\n<p>Many commentaries ask what the difference between Yishmael and the Ben Sorer U'Moreh is:\nIn <a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/d06r.html#fn39\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim (21:18,22)</a>, Rashi tells us that a Ben Sorer U'Moreh is killed because if he wasn't killed, he would ultimately become a degenerate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Verse 18:</strong> ...The wayward, rebellious son is executed in consideration of his ignoble end. The Torah penetrates to the logical conclusion of his thought--- ultimately, he will squander his father's fortune, attempt to apply himself to his studies and fail, station himself near an intersection and plunder his fellow creatures; the Torah declares: Let him die in innocence rather than die laden with guilt.</p>\n<p><strong>Verse 22: If a man is guilty of a capital offense.</strong> The proximity of the chapters teaches that if his mother and father take pity on him, he will ultimately develop into a degenerate, commit transgressions, and be sentenced to death by the courts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The commentaries give many answers why a Ben Sorer U'Moreh is killed if he hasn't sinned yet. Most of these answers focus on explaining that the Ben Sorer U'Moreh is indeed being judged according to his present actions.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/d06n.html#fn36\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mizrachi</a> answers (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40159&pgnum=353\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) that the Ben Sorer U'Moreh has already started sinning, so he is not entirely blameless. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14210&pgnum=123\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh</a> answers that we are killing him because Torah says that a son who fulfills the criteria of a Ben Sorer U'Moreh should be killed. While it's true that Torah has a reason, namely because of what he will become in the future, Beit Din only kills him because he is now halachically in the category of a Ben Sorer U'Moreh (i.e. because of his present deeds), not because of what he will become.</p>\n<p><strong>All these answers make the question about the children used as bricks even stronger. If we only judge based on present actions, why kill the children because of their future actions?</strong></p>\n<p>Even the answer given by the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40140&st=&pgnum=33&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devek Tov</a>, differentiating between Yishmael, whose descendants would sin, and the Ben Sorer U'Moreh, who is himself a sinner, seems to only answer why Yishael wasn't killed. The Devek Tov himself <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40140&pgnum=190\" rel=\"noreferrer\">brings a different answer</a> to explain why the Ben Sorer U'Moreh should be killed. He says that the Earthly Bet Din <em><strong>is</strong></em> judging him based on his future actions, but the Heavenly Court only judges based on present actions.</p>\n<p><strong>If so, the question remains. Why did the Heavenly Court (G-d) decree to kill the children in Egypt, they presently were not wicked?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>One difference might be that in Yishmael's case, it wasn't he personally who was going to be sinning in the future (indeed, he eventually did teshuvah), but his descendants. Whereas Michah and the ben sorer umoreh will be personally guilty.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility: We know (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49294&pgnum=110\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr Hachayim to Gen. 37:21</a>) that in general, Hashem is more reluctant to interfere with people's free will than with anything else in the natural order. In the cases of Michah and the ben sorer umoreh, the killing is being done by people with free will - the Egyptians and (lehavdil) the beis din, respectively. In those cases, then, He won't blatantly interfere to save from their hands people whom He knows are going to grow up to be really wicked. (In the case of the ben sorer umoreh, anyway, the usual rule applies, that \"the judge is to follow only what his eyes see\" - they can't really know the future.) Whereas with Yishmael, his imminent death was one at the hands of G-d directly, and so it's less of an interference for G-d to countermand that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A friend of mine offered an interesting solution. He pointed out as follows.</p>\n\n<p>The angels didn't say, <em>\"His descendants will eventually kill your children with thirst why shouldn't you kill him with thirst?\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Instead, they said, <em>\"for one whose descendants will eventually kill your children with thirst <strong>You will provide for him a well?</strong>\".</em> </p>\n\n<p>In other words, my friend posits, G-d had already decided to let him live (perhaps because, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9903/why-does-there-seem-to-be-different-standards-for-future-sinners/9904#9904\">Alex mentioned in his first answer</a>, it wasn't Yishmael who would kill the Jews with thirst, rather his descendants). The angels were now complaining to G-d, \"We can understand that you've decided to save Yishmael, but why give him a well? His descendants will kill your children with thirst. Give him enough to survive, don't give him a well to satiate himself with\". To which G-d replies that now he is righteous and deserves a well, I won't judge him for what his descendants will do.</p>\n\n<p>If we understand the story with Yishmael this way, the question falls away. We can establish that G-d doesn't have a problem with killing someone now based on their future sins (which is why the Ben Sorer U'Moreh and Michah were both killed based on their future sins), and in the case of Yishmael G-d wasn't planning on killing him.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Is this a good answer? One big problem seems to be that most commentaries try to answer the opposite, that as the Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 16B) says, a person is only judged according to his present actions. [See for example the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14210&pgnum=123\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh (Vayetzei)</a> who explains that the Ben Sorer U'Moreh is judged according to his present actions. The Torah tells us that someone who presently fulfills the criteria of Ben Sorer U'Moreh is killed, and that is why the Beit Din kill him. The reason for this is because of his future actions, but But Beit Din is only doing it because Torah says so -- This doesn't answer the story with Michah however.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I actually find the situation of the Ben sorer a stronger question than with the children being killed in the bricks.</p>\n\n<p>The children in the bricks are neither righteous nor wicked. They have yet to do anything.  They currently have nothing to be judged on in one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>Ishmael, had done good deeds, and bad deeds. He had lived a number of years and could be found to be either righteous or wicked. And today he is Righteous.</p>\n\n<p>The Ben Sorer U'Moreh however, at that point in time is guilty.  He is rebelling against his parents.  He is not currently 'righteous'.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, I read the Rashi on Ishmael as interpreting the gemmorah slightly differently.  The Angels are not saying he is guilty of some crime and so should be punished, as much as they are figuratively saying .. \"Even though right now he is righteous, and should not be punished, shouldn't his status in the future of being wicked, or his descendants of being wicked, be reason for his status of Righteous to be over written?\"  No says Gd, he is righteous now, and so he will be treated with righteousness.</p>\n\n<p>Innocent children, and rebellious children, are not officially in the status of 'righteous' at the point they are being punished. Either from a lack of action or from actively acting badly.</p>\n\n<p><em>For completeness sake:</em>  There is also the possibility that different Tanaim and Amoraim have different philosophical positions on the status of Future sinners.  Rashi could just be providing differing points of view.  But even if so, I think my answer above explains why it is not a contradiction in Rashi's understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Moshe Feinstein (1895-1986), however, held that even the body parts of living people must be buried because a kohen could become tamei from contact with those parts.

Rashi believes the bone was small enough that it would not convey tumah.  The Rashbam (at Baba Basra 116a) argues that Rabbi Yochanan must have been carrying his son's tooth, since that definitely would not convey tumah and does not require burial.  But that position is in dispute.  Although it is well held that a person may benefit from the tooth of a living person, others question whether one is permitted benefit from the tooth of a deceased person.

Technology progresses quickly, it takes time for everyone to be willing to fully accept the latest results. Not everything always ends up being certain as once thought, so sometimes some rabbis are a bit extra conservative and cautious. Also, many rabbonim are willing to rely on DNA evidence alone, so  it is \"seen as a valid source of Halachic decision making\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In terms of the case of the quote of your question, when it comes to identifying a dead body for the purpose of permitting the wife/widow to remarry, there was an argument put forth to not use DNA for such. It went as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The strength of DNA results is in the matching up of several loci. A match between two DNA samples in one location is not very significant. Therefore, it is only the <em>combination</em> of several pieces of information, each of which on their own are not overwhelmingly significant, that creates the incredibly low chance of a false-positive. (Disproving a match, on the other hand, requires much less.) </p>\n\n<p>That being the case, a possible problem arises in using this information for aguna cases. The halacha in testimony for an aguna is that while a <em>siman muvhak</em>, a single definitive marker, is enough, non-definitive markers do not combine, no matter how many there are (Rema <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7542\" rel=\"nofollow\">Even Haezer 17:24</a>). There is a dispute if this only excludes low-quality markers (Beis Shmuel #73), or even average markers (Chelkas Mechokek cited in Beis Shmuel). However, my (brief) research seemed to indicate the odds of any one location match to be about 8%, which is not at all a significant statistic (about 1 in 12!). This being the case, the DNA evidence, which relies on the combination of non-definitive markers, would be invalid.</p>\n\n<p>I would note that many prominent authorities have explicitly said that DNA evidence <em>is</em> valid. R' Elyashiv, cited by Nishman Avraham E.H. 4:14 (along with R' S.Z. Aurbach), R' Z.N. Goldberg in several letters, and I was present when R' Moshe Heinemann said as much.</p>\n\n\n",

This seems lacking in faith in God; surely if not then, He would have had His reasons and would have redeemed us at a later time.  Why do we hold that that single point in time was our only opportunity for redemption from slavery?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: as pointed out in one of the answers, this translation of \"mesheubad\" was flawed, though the broader point about this being pretty much our last chance for redemption still holds (as discussed in some of the answers).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Similar to what <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9944/if-god-had-not-delivered-us-from-egypt-we-would-still-be-slaves-really/9948#9948\">@ShmuelBrin</a> said, but on more of a psychological level:</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://theyeshiva.net/Article/View/55/The-Consciousness-of-Freedom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brought by theyeshiva.net</a>, The Maharal of Prague (Gevurot Hashem 61) explains what happened when the Jews left Egypt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Exodus of Egypt, he suggests, was not merely a political and geographical event, in which slave laborers were allowed to leave a country and forge their own destiny. It was also an existential mutation, in which the gift of freedom was “wired” into the very psyche of a people. With the Divine liberation from Egyptian bondage, a new type of person was created—the Free Man: The individual who will never make peace with oppression and who will forever yearn for liberty. The Exodus implanted within the soul of the Jew an innate repulsion toward subjugation and an inherent quest for liberty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If G-d would have waited even a second longer to take the Jews out of Egypt it would have been too late. G-d could have taken them out later, but by that point they would never have been able to change their state of mind, they, and by extension us - their descendants, would always considered themselves slaves.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Free Man\" of the Maharal could never have existed. </p>\n\n<p>You can take the Jew out of Egypt, but you can't take the Egypt out of the Jew, so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>As it was the Jews didn't feel truly free of the Egyptians until they saw their bodies washed up on the shore of the Red Sea, and even after that they complained many times in the desert that they wished to go back to Egypt. (In fact, if I remember correctly, this is one of the reasons given why the Jews had to wait a generation before entering the land)</p>\n\n<p>So it's not that that was a single point of redemption, as much as it was the last possible time the Jews could have remained in Egyptian bondage and still be able to truly be free once they were redeemed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>You need a more precise translation.</p>\n\n<p>Had God not taken us out of Egypt, then we, our children, and grandchildren would have been <strong>indebted to</strong> Pharaoh.</p>\n\n<p>Hebrew <em>me-she-ubad</em>, as used regarding real estate <em>on lien</em> for paying potential debts.</p>\n\n<p>Had things worked out for our release in other fashions, we would have still owed Pharaoh one. Only by the dramatic show that it was clearly G-d's power, and Pharaoh's not, that we didn't feel indebted to Egypt anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Though note that 800+ plus years later, when Israel was under Babylonian sovereignty and things went south, who did the Jews go running to? Egypt! Apparently the connection runs deep.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>We were at the 49th rung of impurity. We were already idolaters. 4/5 of the Jews didn't want to leave. If we would have waited a little more we would have gotten to the 50th rung which means we would have been too far gone. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://sichosinenglish.org/books/timeless-patterns/37.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> explains that is why we had to run out of Egypt. The evil was still strong and we went out only because of Hashem's great kindness.

The source of this halacha is the\n<strong>Rambam</strong> (Hilchos Tefila 5:2), who writes that in this case, one is obligated\nto eat or drink before davening in order to facilitate proper concentration\nfor davening. However, the Shulchan Aruch only writes that someone who\nis hungry is allowed to eat, which implies that one is not obligated to do so\n(Magen Avraham ibid.:13). This is because nowadays there is a general lack\nof concentration when people daven, and it is assumed that one will not have\nthe proper level of concentration even if he eats before davening. However,\none still may choose to eat if his intention is to better his concentration\n(Magen Avraham ibid. based on Bais Yosef 89)\n.</p>\n<p><strong>The Pri Megadim</strong> (Orach Chaim 89 Eishel Avraham 13) explains that the\nreason for this heter (allowance) is that one is eating for the purpose of\nserving Hashem better, not to gratify his own desires, and so this eating is\nnot regarded as haughtiness. According to this view, the prohibition does\nnot apply at all.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>According to the opinion of the Pri Megadim, one would be\npermitted to eat and daven later with the minyan. The eating is intended to\nenable davening with proper concentration and with a minyan, and, according\nto the Pri Megadim, this removes the issue of haughtiness altogether (Shu”t\nMahari Shteif 41).\nOne who wishes to follow the lenient opinion and eat before davening\nin order to concentrate properly while davening with a minyan should\npreferably recite the first chapter of Shema, as well as a minimum\nprayer containing a praise, request, and thanks to Hashem\n, as this fulfills the\nminimum obligation of prayer and thus suffices for the purpose of relying\non this leniency (see Shu”t Mahari Shteif ibid., Shemiras Shabbos Kihilchasa\n52:fn. 48).</p>\n\n\n",

It seems here to imply that if you don't say the exact right word, you will have the wrong conceptions of Gd and prayer and will be doing more harm than good.  At first glance, both the boor and the correct nusach are saying the same thing, with slightly different grammatical forms, or synonyms.  From this discussion it seems clear that the correct general concept is the most important, and the individual meaning of each word is not so important.  Meaning, what is a correct nusach and an incorrect nusach is created by the meaning of the words as a whole, rather than the individual meanings of each word. (Both the boor and the talmud chacham say the same indivdual words, but the order they are in and the grammer makes the difference).  Since you are reading from a siddur, there is no risk of making a mistake with the words, only with individual translations. So ensuring that you have the correct general concept is more important.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly in chasidic circles, the story of <a href=\"http://www.ascentofsafed.com/cgi-bin/ascent.cgi?Name=567-02\" rel=\"nofollow\">the little boy who could not read hebrew</a>, but could only read the alephbet during Yom kippur services, suggests that the exact words are the least important and the kavnah makes all the difference. (Even if you don't know any words at all to say)  Note, this story is not meant to teach halacha, just rather the importance of kavana.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason why they are permitted to use without immersion is because any vessel that you throw away after using it once is not considered enough of a vessel to require immersion (R' Moshe maintains this applies even if the disposable vessel is reused, assuming the vessel is flimsy) - see <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2010/Torah%20Perspectives%20on%20Recycling.doc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">footnotes 29 and 30 from this document</a> from YU (footnote 30 is mis-attributed to 4:192, it should be Teshuvot V'Hanhagot <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49820&pgnum=290\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:259</a>. see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7021/aluminum-pan-reuse/9991#9991\">here</a> as well).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is one other \"use once before immersing\" case, which can also be confusing.

The answer is they may do the latter.  So even if one is not using the utensil in a disposable fashion, removing items from a utensil is not \"use\" for this purpose.  This may be a cause of misconception.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Another thing that may have happened -- and this is pure speculation -- is if you have to run out and buy a new pot ten minutes before shabbos and don't have time to dunk it in the mikva, you can temporarily gift it to a non-Jew who will loan it to you; then it's not owned by a Jew and it doesn't need dunking.

What were the reasons behind it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In the Rabbi Frand tape on choosing Hebrew names, he points to a sefer from only a few hundred years ago that says the Hebrew name <em>shneur</em> was coined when a baby was born; one parent wanted to name the child <em>Meir</em> (\"illuminator\"), after his/her father; the other parent wanted <em>Yair</em> (\"shall illuminate\"), after her/his father; they compromised and named the baby <em>shnai-or</em> (\"two lights\"). But you see that giving two names wasn't common then, or else they could have just called him Meir Yair. (Or Yair Meir ... or maybe they could have, but then they'd fight over who was first? ...)</p>\n\n<p>I recall hearing in yeshiva that the only <em>Rishon</em> with two names is someone in Tosfos called Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael (see Kesubos 98b <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Ketubot.98b.3.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה אמר רב פפא</a>). And even then, Yaakov and Yisrael were two names of one person; giving two totally different names was not the fashion a few hundred years ago.</p>\n\n<p>There's the story with Rabbi Akiva Eiger of some child who was having terrible nightmares or something, it turned out he was named after two different grandfathers who had hated each others' guts. Rabbi Eiger went to their graves and demanded they make up with one another; whereupon the child's condition improved.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, someone asked Rabbi Yaakov Shmuel Weinberg, the late Rosh Yeshiva of Baltimore's Ner Israel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rebbe, I hear that if you name the child after two different people, the child will be crazy?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who replied:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>-- Do I look crazy to you?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't know. But <em>Moshe</em> was also <em>Avig'dor</em>, <em>Tov</em>, and others, it so would seem to date back at least to then.</p>\n\n<p>As far as someone with two names used together (as opposed to alternate names like <em>Moshe</em>'s), we have <em>Tzaf'nas Pa'neach</em> back in <em>B'reshis</em>, though it's a non-Jewish name; a little later (chronologically), there's <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90_%D7%91_%D7%A0%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Chatzi Ham'nuchos</em></a> (which some, though not <em>Rashi</em>, explain is a [Jewish] name); and later, in <em>Sh'muel</em>, there's <em>I Chavod</em>, a Jewish name.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Iran, we did this so that we keep our Jewish indentity. We have two names. A persian (secular) name and a Jewish name that we use in the Shul. This way we can function in the society and keep Jewish. I am sure the same applies anywhere else.

For instance, can one lie in order to get others to perform a Mitzvah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It will depend on the case, Judaism takes a balanced approach to this issue. Judaism definitely does not subscribe to the absolutist position of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deontologists</a> such as Kant that the ends never justify the means. Kant would say that one could never lie, even to save someone else. However, in Judaism, every sin except 3 is <em>nidcheh</em> if there's any <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7107/saving-a-life-during-tefillah/7129#7129\">danger to life</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There are also more complex cases where the ends may justify the means. For example, <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F#.D7.90.D7.95.D7.94.D7.91_.D7.A9.D7.9C.D7.95.D7.9D_.D7.95.D7.A8.D7.95.D7.93.D7.A3_.D7.A9.D7.9C.D7.95.D7.9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chazal say</a> that when Aharon haKohen saw 2 people were in a fight, he would approach each one of them and say that the other was sorry for having wronged the other, but was too embarrassed to come forth and say so. Although he wasn't being fully honest, this way he would help bring reconciliation among the Jews, and is praised for it (see Malachi 2:5-7). Lying is a social wrong, but its not a clear-cut prohibition in all cases. So in cases where its for the greater social good of the people involved, it may be praiseworthy. However, one must carefully evaluate the circumstances to see if good will really come from it. Tricking people to get them to do a mitzvah might lead to a chilul haShem later on, so it will depend on the case. </p>\n\n<p>Aharon's love for the Jews and willingness to 'sin' for the greater good sometimes went too far. I.e. Aharon went along with their plan to create the Golden Calf. Chazal explain this was too prevent the Jews from going too far in sin and possibly killing him, the Kohen and prophet. Yet even so, God is extremely critical of Aharon for this, and only Moshe's intercession saves him (See Devarim 9:20). This is because Idolatry is such a serious sin, no \"end\" can justify committing it. </p>\n\n<p>Chazal also discuss the case of Yael, where she seems to have seduced the enemy general, Sisera, and then killed him. They say \"gadol avirah lishma m'mizvah shelo lishmah\" (Horayos 10b). So in certain circumstances, even a complete sin may be allowed so as to save the Jews. However, Yael may not have even been Jewish, and this dictum is not applied elsewhere. So as a general rule, a direct biblical prohibition can only be violated to save a life, while a lower social wrong can be allowed for the greater good. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>An example of <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_ends_justify_the_means\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>the ends justify the means</em></a> in Judaism is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e124n.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>makos mardus</em></a>: although the means (hitting someone) is repugnant, we do so because of the end, which is the retention of a civil, Torah-observant society.</p>\n\n\n",

In its path are five people who have been tied to the track by a mad philosopher. Fortunately, you could flip a switch, which will lead the trolley down a different track to safety. Unfortunately, there is a single person tied to that track. Should you flip the switch or do nothing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I could imagine one could come up with all sorts of similar cases (e.g. shooting down a hijacked plane is one variation I could think of).</p>\n\n<p>My question is: what would Judaism say in such cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I think the general view is that is forbidden to flip a switch to cause the death of 1 person to prevent 5 other people from dying. Judaism does not just take the utilitarian view to just look at the ends and ignore the means involved, especially when dealing with committing a sin such as murder. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9993/does-the-end-justify-the-means\">Does the end justify the means</a>.) Therefore it would be better to \"shev v'al ta'aseh\" rather than commit an act of murder. After all \"mai chazis\" that the 5 people's lives are more valuable than the one person's life? (See Pesachim p. 25) You are not God to be able to make such judgements. </p>\n\n<p>I think this would hold true even if it was only a case of grama and one would not be liable for the death penalty for killing the person. The accepted halacha holds that the 3 cardinal sins are \"yehareg v'al ya'avor\" even when they are just \"abuzraya\". Therefore even though one would only be committing an abuzraya of murder, it would still not be allowed. </p>\n\n<p>The case in Yerushalmi and Tosefta on Terumah (which the Rambam in Yesodei haTorah is based on) are discussing a much more complicated case involving enemies and betrayal, uncertain results, and the death of the person in question either way. Therfore I do not know how easily it could be applied to this case. </p>\n\n<p>As for a shooting down a hijacked plane, R' Bleich just published an article in Traditon on this topic which forbids it, which I'm sure quotes many more sources. His view is summarized by <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/49607\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Broyde</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Bleich's essay represents his view that the sanctity of innocent\n  life - not in wartime - is very profound. Many other halachic\n  authorities adopt the view that at least in wartime one certainly can\n  kill innocent people to save the lives of the multitudes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless one can somehow consider the entire plane to  have a din of a rodef, it seems difficult that one can say we can directly go and kill everyone on the plane beforehand (although the fact that they will die soon anyways does make it different than the trolley case) . R' Broyde seems to say that different rules apply during war, but I would normally assume this applies to enemy civilians, not captives. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rambam Yesode HaTorah 5:5 </p>\n\n<p>\"If gentiles tell [a group of] women: \"Give us one of you to defile.

A table or pier will be a very short space to drop (at least) 10 tefachim.</p>\n\n<p>If the entire coast of Manhattan fits this criterion then it would be a wall.  The Manhattan eruv is under the rabbis who give it its kashrut/maintenance.

I.e., if you put an eruv around a reshut harabim it doesn't do anything — still can't carry. </p>\n\n<p>If you can prove that Manhattan has halachic walls then it could well be point 2 that stops Manhattan having an eruv under those rabbis.  A rabbi that was involved in the Manhattan eruv told me that even the (smaller) Manhattan eruv may have problem 2.</p>\n\n\n",

As the Rambam <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1061799/jewish/Perek-1.htm\">goes on to state</a>, there are cases where this consecration does occur, cases where it does not occur, and cases where there is disagreement over whether or not it occurs.  The ramifications of an animal having consecrated status are many, which is why the question of whether or not an animal is consecrated is relevant in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

It is my understanding that up until recently, <em>most</em> Rabbis agreed that in regard to creation, it meant a 24 hour period. Once scientists came up with theories about the age of the universe many Rabbis began to engage in what has been called \"apologetics\", explaining that \"day\" was metaphorical for \"eras\".</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, whenever something in the Torah isn't meant literally, its always explained in the Talmud. The most famous example of something not meant literally is \"an eye for an eye\" which the Talmud says quite clearly (Bava Kamma, 83b-84a) that it refers to monetary compensation.

If it had meant anything else, certainly that would have been part of the oral tradition. Instead, the Rabbis in the Talmud explain what happened in each hour of the sixth day (Sanhedrin 38b). In addition, if it hadn't meant \"days\" literally, the Jewish observance of Shabbos as the seventh <em>day</em> of the week would be pretty meaningless. In fact, the entire concept of a seven day week would have no point. Also, the addition of \"it was evening and it was morning, the _____ day\" makes it quite clear to me that it was a \"day\" in the traditional meaning, albeit without the sun.</p>\n\n<p>As a final point, the Lubavitcher Rebbe points out in a <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=FmabnhsgSVAC&lpg=PR1&dq=mind%20over%20matter&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">letter</a> that there are those Rabbis who don't hold that the six days are literal, and therefore say that the world is older than 5771 years (as of this writing). For these Rabbis there is a serious problem with the text of the \"get\" or bill of divorce. Halacha is very stringent with the exact text of the bill (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/557971/jewish/Text-of-the-Get.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mazorguide.com/living/Divorce/GetText.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), because if the intended meaning is changed slightly - the bill is invalidated, the divorce is not valid, and any remarriage becomes adultery. On the bill of divorce, there must be written a date, and this date must be of the form - \"Five thousand seven hundred and seventy one years according to the creation of the world according to our counting here\". The Lubavitcher Rebbe points out that this would be contradicted by any interpretation of \"days\" being \"epochs\" or \"eras\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although the Torah says the world was created in the six-days, we could understand them as six periods of time.

I have been told that this is out of respect.</p>\n\n<p>In Hebrew, however, there are no capital letters at all (or all caps if you prefer); so how did this practice get started in other languages?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is a matter of the English language.  I found this site which goes through some of the 'rules'. <a href=\"http://www.teachingcollegeenglish.com/2004/02/04/capitalizing-god/\">http://www.teachingcollegeenglish.com/2004/02/04/capitalizing-god/</a></p>\n\n<p>In essennce, a capital first letter implies a 'proper noun', it also implies a bit of 'the one and only'.  Capitalizing the word 'He' means 'that \"He\" which we all know, the one and only.. sortof.  It's not a hard and fast rule and different people will do it differently.</p>\n\n<p>The main reason I'm answer this question though, is that it is possible, that capitalizing certain words has the same affect as the word \"et\" in Hebrew.  As in \"Et Hashamim, v'et haaretz'  It's there to emphasize importance.  You will notice in the link that not only Gd is capitalized, but also \"Justice\" or \"Evil\"</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud, (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=62&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot 32B</a>) tells us the source for this is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2684.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 84:5</a>, \"<em>Happy are they that dwell in Thy house, they are ever praising Thee. Selah\"</em>. First they dwell in your house, and then they praise you (Rashi).</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot (32B) says that this is why the Rabbis established that we say the verse \"Ashrei Yoshvei\" before starting Psalm 145, to exclude who say many verses that start with the word Ashrei. (In other words, the Rabbis said to say this verse, since it has a special connection to the beginning of prayer, more so than other verses that start with Ashrei)</p>\n\n<p>The Tzelota D'Avraham <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20312&pgnum=246\" rel=\"nofollow\">points out</a> that even in the time of the Talmud the prayer of Tefilla LeDavid was referred to as Ashrei. In <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=6&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot 4B</a>, R' Yochanan asks, if the prayer is alphabetical, why is there no Nun in Ashrei? From here we see that even in the time of the Talmud they were already referring to the prayer as Ashrei.</p>\n\n<p>The Tzelota D'Avraham puts both these ideas together and says that at least as far back as the time of the Talmud, the custom was to say the last verse of Psalm 144 (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26e4.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 15</a>) before reciting Psalm 145, since they are contiguous and also thematically similar. (Similarly to the way we make sure to add \"Emet\" at the end of Shema, because there is a verse that says \"V'Hashem Elo-eichem Emet\".)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...happy is the people whose God is the LORD...I will extol Thee, my God, O King; and I will bless Thy name for ever and ever.\"  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later on (as Tosafot said), they added Psalm 84:5, because of the connection to the beginning of prayer.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Tzelota L'Avraham <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20312&pgnum=255\" rel=\"nofollow\">later offers</a> an additional answer. He says that they didn't want to start with Tehilla L'David, because it can be misinterpreted to mean \"A Song of Praise to David\" (instead of \"By David\"). So they decided to start from the previous verse. However, that previous verse doesn't make sense on it's own, because it says <em>\"Happy is the people that is in such a case.\"</em>. What is the case? So they added another verse before it, <em>\"Happy are they that dwell in Thy house, they are ever praising Thee...\".</em> </p>\n\n<p>Happy is the people that such is the case, that they are ever praising You.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is one question we have left. Ashrei is not in the beginning of the prayers, so why would the Rabbis add a verse referring to pre-prayer preparations in the middle of prayer? To this, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15782&pgnum=135\" rel=\"nofollow\">My Prayer answers</a> that it was originally inserted in the beginning of the Afternoon service.

Even if one could live for thousands of years, enjoying all of the most sublime pleasures of Olam Hazeh, it wouldn't be worth even a second of the pleasures of Gan Eden.</p>\n<p>Therefore we should do our best to not become attached to wordly pleasures, because this attachment is something that must be removed before we can go to Gan Eden. They would act as a \"distraction\" and Gehinom is there to \"detox\" us from worldly pleasures.</p>\n<p>Now, this is well known, but what is less well known is that this \"step up\" from our world to Gan Eden is just the first rung in an infinite ladder. The \"lower\" Gan Eden's pleasures must also be forgotten before our souls ascend to the \"higher\" Gan Eden, and this is achieved by the \"River of Fire\" that separates each level. The Alter Rebbe <a href=\"https://he.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5899070#v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועד״ז יש עליות לאין קץ כו׳ יהללוך <strong>סלה</strong> כו׳ והכל הוא  רק בהתפשטות\nהארה משמו ית׳ וזהו ענין <strong>סלה</strong> שהוא מורה על התגלות הארה מעתיק  המלובש\nבבינה ע׳ בפרדס בעה״כ ערך <strong>סלה</strong> ובזוהר פ׳ ויקרא דף כ׳ ע״א ובמק״מ שם\nוהיינו כי מקור כל התענוגים הוא בחי׳ אורו וזיוו ית׳. וזהו ענין נהנים\nמזיו  והיינו כי כל התענוגים הנ״ל הם התלבשות הארת התענוג בחו״ב שמזה\nנמשך בג״ע  איזה הארה וגילוי. והארת התענוג הנמשך בחו״ב נמשך מבחי׳ אור\nא״ס ב״ה הוא  בחי׳ שמו ית׳ שהוא מקור התענוגים היינו עצם התענוג שלא\nכענין התענוג מדבר  שחוץ ממנו וכנ״ל כ״א שבחי׳ אור א״ס ב״ה הוא עצמו\nתענוג א״ס ממש.</p>\n<p>And in this manner, there are endless ascents, as it is written: \"They\nshall praise You, <strong>Selah</strong>\", etc. And all of this occurs only within\nthe expansion of a radiance from His Name, blessed be He. This is the\nmeaning of \"<strong>Selah</strong>\", which signifies the revelation of light from\nAtik as it is enclothed within Binah. See Pardes by Rabbi Moshe\nCordovero, entry <strong>Selah</strong>, and in Zohar, Parashat Vayikra p. 20a, and\nin Mikdash Melech there. For the source of all delights is the\nradiance of His Light and Splendor, blessed be He. And this is the\nmeaning of \"deriving pleasure from the radiance\". That is to say, all\nthe aforementioned delights exist only through the enclothing of the\nradiance of delight within Chochmah and Binah, from which an\nillumination and revelation is drawn into Gan Eden. And the radiance\nof delight that extends into Chochmah and Binah itself originates from\nthe Or Ein Sof, blessed be He. This refers to His Name, blessed be He,\nwhich is the source of all delights — meaning, the essence of delight\nitself, unlike worldly pleasure, which is derived from something\nexternal to itself, as mentioned above. Rather, the Or Ein Sof,\nblessed be He, is itself an infinite delight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Specifically, Selah represents how each level of divine pleasure and revelation is drawn down through Chochmah and Binah into progressively higher levels of Gan Eden.</p>\n<p>Here is a mashal I have come up with to help understand.</p>\n<p>When a person first learns to speak, they are struggling with words. Eventually, they master words to the point that they can speak effectively without constantly struggling to choose words (in the same way that when we start typing on a keyboard, we first struggle to find the keys, but eventually we conquer that and our fingers do the work for us without struggle).</p>\n<p>Then, when a person has lots of words, they learn a complicated concept. They struggle with the understand of the concept for a while, but slowly, they become fluent in it, to the point that they no longer struggle with it, and have it as readily available as they do words themselves.</p>\n<p>Then they study an entire field, with all its concepts, struggling with them until they are fluent in them all, and their interconnectedness within the field, to the point they have the entire field readily available to them, in the same way as before.</p>\n<p>Then they study several connected fields, until they are fluent in them all and have a whole philosophy readily available. Then they have multiple philosophies, and so on and on and on, without limit.</p>\n<p>The Nimshal - there is just Chochma at first - simple ideas like \"give\" and \"take\" etc have to be experientially learned, until we understand them without words, as children. We have to go through a difficult process of learning, and then assigning words to these simple concepts. Chochma is eventually expanded, and then mapped onto words and structure, in the Binah, which reveals the Chochma. We are ready to take things up a notch as above.</p>\n<p>The source of delights is Hashem's Ohr Ein Sof, and it is first revealed in Chochma. All the pleasure of everything we \"know\" has to enter our soul through our Chochma, and therefore there is a long process of growing to accomodate more lofty and lofty pleasures. Ultimately, at the \"top\" of the infinite ladder, is the Mekor Ta'anugim, the Source of Delights Himself. Our \"basking in the light of the Shechina\" is our Olam Haba, where He no longer hides behind a Tzimzum, i.e. receded from our revealed intellect, but available to our actual Binah - the faculty of \"down to earth\" comprehension through which we can grasp increasingly lofty levels of Divine Delight. Each level must be fully integrated and then transcended, just as the souls in lower Gan Eden must \"forget\" their previous pleasures through the River of Fire before ascending to higher Gan Eden.</p>\n<p>Another mashal given is the words of thought vs. the words of speech. Words as they exist in our thoughts are much more sublime and \"ineffable\" compared to the words of speech, but eventually they act as the source of the words of speech. This helps us understand the concept of \"Atik becoming revealed in Binah\". Atik is considered the \"lowest rung\" of the \"next level\", i.e. still on the next level and thus infinite and sublime compared to the level one is currently on, and is thus a \"ta'anug\", a great, expansive delight beyond one's comprehension. The process of ascending until it is unified in one's Binah and is thus \"down to earth\" is the process of ascent we are describing.</p>\n<p>This process continues infinitely, as our sages state regarding Torah scholars (\"students of Chochma\"): \"They go from strength to strength\". Each new level reveals a more sublime aspect of Divine pleasure, progressively closer to the Source of Delights Himself.</p>\n<p><strong>The word Selah represents this eternal progression</strong> - how the light from Atik  becomes clothed in Binah, allowing for an endless series of revelations. Each revelation brings us closer to experiencing the Essence of Delight Himself, which unlike worldly pleasures that come from external sources, is the <em>intrinsic</em> delight of Ohr Ein Sof.</p>\n<p>Through this process, what was once completely beyond our grasp becomes integrated into our understanding, only to reveal yet higher levels waiting to be comprehended, in an eternal journey of spiritual ascent, <em>Selah</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Nothing grew on this mountain and it seemed to be void of any plant life. These two mountains, which stood side by side, presented the most striking visualization of beracha and klala. They are both being nourished by the same soil, the same water and the same wind. Yet, Har Aival was barren of all shrubbery while Har Grizim was full of lush vegetation, all the way up the mountain. We see that beracha and klala are not dependent on external appearances; they lie within a person’s heart. Brocha and Klala lie within a person’s craving and interest in the Ribono Shel Olam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, based <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gerizim\">on an image in Wikipedia</a>, we can see that Har Gerizim is lush with grass.

Please consult your Rav for any practical scenarios.</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Pesach Posuach Lireshus Horabim\",</em> an open door, is more than just a literal open door. It is the idea that the house is theoretically open to the public, so an uninvited guest/passerby could theoretically walk in. So if the door is open, but no one could possibly get in uninvited (e.g. there is a gate around the house), an open door would not help at all. (see <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/06.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). That's why the heter only works during the day. And that is why there may be situations where the door does not have to be physically open.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Laws of Yichud</a> (by R' Nissan David Dubov), a housekeeper or maid is someone you have a warm and cordial relationship with (Libo Gas Bah), see <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/05.htm#t48\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/06.htm#t103\" rel=\"nofollow\">Later on</a>, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is disputed among the Poskim as to whether the heter of a Pesach Posuach (an open door) applies in the case of a Libo Gas Boh, i.e. with an individual with whom there is a warm and cordial relationship. In practice, one may be lenient when necessary; however, the door should literally be left open. (some Poskim [hold] that a closed but unlocked door constitutes a Pesach Posuach. One may generally rely on that opinion. However, in this case where the Poskim dispute as to whether a Pesach Posuach works at all to prevent Yichud with a Libo Gas Boh, one should definitely be stringent and leave the door literally open.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is an idea in the Laws of Yichud that a persons wife guards him from immoral behavior, provided that she is close by. <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/07.htm#t162\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therefore</a>, <em>\"if a man is at home alone and his wife is at work, and a female housekeeper arrives to clean, then he should leave the door literally open, thereby creating a Pesach Posuach. If his wife is in the vicinity and she is expected home shortly, then if she has the key, the door may be closed. If she doesn't have the key, the door may be closed but left unlocked.\"</em> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/07.htm#t183\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> he explains that children function as shomrim to permit Yichud from the ages of 6 to 9, when they are old enough to know what's going on, and young enough to be immune from participation.</p>\n\n<p>A little later on he says, <em>\"A child is an effective shomer for allowing the Yichud of a man with a prutzah or a non-Jewish woman. Therefore, a man may be alone in the house with a non-Jewish cleaning lady in the presence of a child shomer.\"</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/05.htm#n48\" rel=\"nofollow\">Footnote 48</a> he brings opinions who explain that even observant Jews may still be considered Prutzim when it comes to the laws of Yichud, if they meet the criteria:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Toras HaYichud 3:2:4 writes that men who know of the prohibition of arayos and tznius and yet who still watch television, read unsuitable material and visit movie theaters, etc., are considered prutzim. See also Shevet Halevi Vol. 5:202:1. Rabbi Shmuel Neiman in his book 9 to 5 — A Guide to Modest Conduct for Today's Workplace, writes (p. 39), \"It cannot be stressed enough that the term prutzim also refers to people who are otherwise shomrei Torah u'mitzvos, but are not careful in matters relating to kraivah l'arayos. They may be regularly exposed to immodesty through the media, or may often be in the presence of immoral individuals through their everyday social interactions....(p.34) meaning that they are exposed to immodesty through television, movies, the Internet, in publications and the like. An individual involved in such activities is labeled a parutz. This is not limited to visual images; someone who is exposed to any form of indecent activity, such as chat rooms on the Internet, is considered a parutz. Such forms of recreation are a breach of morality.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it seems that doing what needs to be done to prevent Yichud with a housekeeper is also sufficient if the man is a \"Parutz\" (I may have missed some aspects though).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Actually you have number of question here.\nLet's start one by one.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If someone can enter the apartment without knocking it allows ihud.</li>\n<li>For a married man if his wife with him she saves him from ihud, if she is not - there is no difference between married and non-married.</li>\n<li>A child from 6 years saves from ihud.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Source: lectures of R.

We see the cruelty, the suffering, the injustice in the world and we say: ‘This is the will of God.’ We accept what we should not accept. That is when God sends us atheists to remind us that what passes for religion is not always religion. Sometimes what we accept in the name of God is what we should be fighting against in the name of God.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Did this story actually happen or is it a parable to illustrate a point?

If so, what did He permit that corresponds to the sin of heresy?”</p>\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov replied, “Acts of kindness.”</p>\n<p>Because when you see a person suffering, you don’t say, “G‑d runs the universe. G‑d will take care. G‑d knows what is best.” You do everything in your power to relieve that suffering as though there is no G‑d.

Does he believe that God created everything for a purpose? He said that of course he believed that God created everything for a purpose. They said in that case, why did God create atheists? And he replied “Because those who have faith sometimes make their peace with the injustices of this world by claiming that they are the will of God. Therefore God created atheists to protest and fight every injustice”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37692&pgnum=313\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefer Pardes Yosef on parshat Teruma chapter 25 sub ubb\"b d\"y [= ubibava batra daf yod]</a> where it is described how the Besh\"t was asked about a Talmudic source which says that every Torah prohibition has a permitted aspect to it, so where is heresy permitted? His answer was that in performing the mitzvah of charity, one should help the poor man as if there does not exist any Divine source that will help him.

The non-believer challenges\nthe religious man’s concept of the Divine, forcing the religious man\nto re-assess his perceptions. Not only does this strengthen the\nreligious community by demanding a re-evaluation, it is also necessary\nfor the community’s continued development. Since God is a priori\nundefinable, the religious community’s perceptions of the Divine, and\ntheir consequent behavior, must constantly be revised. Hence heresy,\n“kefira,” is the only dark force capable of contributing to world\nperfection\"  (This was quoted <a href=\"http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/12/17/hitchens-atheism-and-rav-kook/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His view is also summarized in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism_and_religion#Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia as</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community\nin Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God:\nrather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any\nman-made image of God can be considered an idol, Kook held that, in\npractice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn\naway false images of God, thus in the end serving the purpose of true\nmonotheism. Atheists generally do not accept this point of view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have found no other sources for this idea.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I heard similar stories about the disciple asking the Rabbi about kindness and epikoros was by the Chofetz Chaim!  </p>\n\n<p>That said, just because it's in a book of collected things people said he said, doesn't mean he really said it. A Rabbi from that same area in Eastern Europe once said a little bit of everything under the sun was attributed to the Choftez Chaim, and not all of it so. </p>\n\n<p>If some of the same stories are attributed to the Baal Shem Tov, maybe it's not authentic (pick a famous person, any famous person). This attributing of parables to famous people may just be a way a person adds weight to their words,  of worming unorthodox ideas into the mainstream, or doesn't take 100% responsibility for what unorthodox thing was just said (it was some famous Rabbi, not me :). </p>\n\n<p>It's an interesting question. Based on other things Baal Shem Tov, Chofetz Chaim,  wrote, equating epikoros with non-observance, I'm not sure any of those Rabbis would say Atheists were created by G-d to be Atheists. One technique would be to look at other writings and see if the ideas \"hang together\" logically.</p>\n\n<p>The first story permits heresy as a way of 'out-Orthodoxing the Orthodox\". The second story also speaks to this as not relying on G-d to do everything, to engage in Tikkun. I don't know if the Baal Shem Tov would really say that because the idea of Tikkun isn't something heretics or atheists own. </p>\n\n<p>Since no one can find a clear source, just parables that may be attributed to both Chofetz Chaim, and the B'sht, the first story about \"a famous Rabbi\" could very well be a literary device through which Rabbi Sacks himself is speaking, and an idea with which he himself agrees. </p>\n\n\n",

If I ask my 6 year old kid if it's kosher, and she says yes, and I eat it based on that, obviously I'm an idiot and liable to whatever Heavenly punishment is in order if the food is really not kosher.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if I ask my Rav, and he paskens that it's kosher, I am presumably allowed (perhaps even obligated?) to rely on his psak.  But what if he made a mistake, and it's really not kosher?  Did I sin in G-d's eyes?  Is it considered <em>shogeig</em> (careless) or <em>oneis</em> (accidental)?  Do I get <em>timtum halev</em> (spiritual blemish from eating non-kosher)?  If he applied the best of his knowledge of Torah, does the Rav get an aveira against his name?</p>\n\n<p>Is there something special about having \"semicha\" in our times?  (I deliberately put it in quotes, since it's not the <strong>real</strong> semicha.)  In other words, if I took the same shaala to a yeshiva student, who's been learning in the Mir for 10 years but never got semicha, and he tells me it's kosher, can I rely on him?  Same questions as above for if he's wrong - sin / <em>shogeig</em> / <em>oneis</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Or is it all a matter of personal responsibility: when I have a health problem I consult the expert: my doctor.  When I want financial advice, I go to a financial consultant.  And when I need spiritual advice, I go to my Rabbi or local <em>talmid chacham</em> for expert opinion.  The \"semicha\" that my Rebbe has is then kind of like the Med School certificate on the doctor's wall: accreditation from a recognized 3rd party that this person knows what he's doing, and I can rely on him, if I trust the certifying authority.  It's helpful to have semicha, but if I have personal knowledge that my friend from the Mir knows his halacha, I can rely on him as much as a Rabbi with \"semicha\".</p>\n\n<p>So, what is the correct explanation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>With regarding making a psak, there are a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=208\" rel=\"nofollow\">few opinions</a> as to the meaning of \"psak\" (as it pertains to the law of not making a psak in front of your teacher):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One can make a psak if the case is clear, like Bittul Bshishim, Nosein Taam Lifgam, etc.</li>\n<li>One can make a psak if the matter was already written in poskim, but one cannot compare cases.</li>\n<li>One cannot answer any question, even an obvious question like \"is an egg allowed in milk?\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With regards to nowadays-smicha, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=209\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aruch Hashulchan</a> writes that smicha has two components:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A certificate of knowledge (like a degree).</li>\n<li>A \"Ntilas Rshus\" (Taking permission).

Because he does not have a responsibility to paskin, he would not have the assistance from heaven to rule correctly.</p>\n\n<p>In another place, the Lubavitcher Rebbe points out that the Gemarah says \"Anyone who learned ... but didn't do shimush is an ignoramus\".

    "content": "# what is \"kodesh\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What does the word קֹדֶשׁ (sometimes קודש), <em>kodesh</em>, mean?</p>\n\n<p>Its form is that of a noun, like אֹכֶל or בֹּקֶר or לֹבֶן. But <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/30804\">קדושה is a noun</a>, and (I'm pretty sure) it means \"the state/quality of being קָדֹשׁ\" (arguendo, \"the state/quality of being holy\"), so I find it unlikely that קֹדֶשׁ means the same. If it does, then what's the difference between it and קדושה?</p>\n\n<p>And if קֹדֶשׁ means \"something that is holy\" — which I suspect, and which would explain phrases like קֹדֶשׁ קדשים (the room or the <em>korbanos</em>) — then how do we understand phrases like שַׁבַּת קֹדֶשׁ (literally then \"the <em>Shabas</em> of something holy\") and וּבְדִבְרֵי קָדְשְׁךָ (literally then \"in your words of something holy\")?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I think the difference might be that קֹדֶשׁ means \"something holy\" (just as אֹכֶל means \"something edible\"), whereas קְדֻשָּׁה is the abstract noun \"holiness.\"</p>\n\n<p>The form קְדֻשָּׁה doesn't seem to appear in Tanach; things there are always described as קֹדֶשׁ or קָדֹשׁ, with the former often - but not always - modifying a noun in construct form. So שבת קדש would mean \"the Shabbos which is holy,\" ובדברי קדשך would mean \"in Your words which are holy,\" and so forth. (Temurah 1:1 quotes the Biblical יִהְיֶה קֹּדֶשׁ and explains it as קדושה חלה עליו, which is a good example of the difference: the Torah is speaking in the active form, \"it shall be a holy object,\" whereas the Mishnah uses the passive \"holiness takes effect on it.\")</p>\n\n<p>(Although I once saw a note - it might have been in the Metsudah siddur, but I don't remember for certain - that R. Yaakov Kamenetsky zt\"l noted that the standard translation of עיר הקדש as \"the holy city\" is incorrect, and it should be \"the city of holiness.\" I think his point was that if הקדש was an adjective modifying עיר, then it would have had to be in the feminine form הַקְּדֹשָׁה. According to that, then, קֹדֶשׁ would indeed mean \"holiness,\" and there'd be no difference in meaning between that and קְדֻשָּׁה - we would have to assume that it's simply a difference between Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrew.)</p>\n\n\n",

Yechiel Michel Epstein <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34915&pgnum=66\">(Kitzur Shaloh, laws of Shema)</a> oppose this and say that kubbutz should be pronounced the same as shuruk (i.e., both as <strong>u</strong>), while Maharal <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42867&pgnum=513\">(Tiferes Yisroel, ch. 66)</a> and Levush <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24855&pgnum=96\">(Levush HaOrah on Parshas Beshalach)</a> say exactly the opposite - that they should indeed have distinct sounds.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, apparently at some point after that, the sound of kubbutz itself began to diverge among different groups of Ashkenazim. Some followed R. Shabsai and R. Yechiel Michel and unfronted it (making it into <strong>u</strong>), while others unrounded it (making it like German <strong>i</strong>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel\">IPA /ɪ/</a>) - and then proceeded to turn shuruk into the same sound. </p>\n\n\n",

The other opinion is Rashi. Rashi gives the reason that the tastes of the meat stays in ones mouth and he quotes the Chumash (in parishes b'halosecha ch 11 הַבָּשָׂ֗ר עוֹדֶ֨נּוּ֙ בֵּ֣ין שִׁנֵּיהֶ֔ם טֶ֖רֶם יִכָּרֵ֑ת וְאַ֤ף יְהֹוָה֙ חָרָ֣ה בָעָ֔ם וַיַּ֤ךְ יְהֹוָה֙ בָּעָ֔ם מַכָּ֖ה רַבָּ֥ה מְאֹֽד:) for his reason. This means that if one only chewed meat but did not swallow one would have to wait b/c the meat gets stuck in your teeth and if one ate meat but did not chew one would still have to wait b/c the taste of the meat will still be in your mouth. There is no explicit mention of a difference between raw meat and cooked meat nor do I think there is a logical reason to make a difference between the two in regards to how long ones waits after eating meat.</p>\n\n\n",

If one desired to fulfill a mitzvah but was unable to due to extenuating circumstance, the Torah considers as if he fulfilled it.\nSo too, as when you gave the money you desired to give tzedaka, the fact that it was fraud is an Ones and you had no idea it was a fraud.

However, in terms of fulfilling your obligation, it would seem to be that you have not fulfilled the mitzvah of Ma'aser Kesafim, for this is not a case of Ones, physically barred from performing the mitzvah, rather this would be considered a case of shogeg - an unwitting mistake, as you should have looked into the charity beforehand.

Can you please clarify?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226502309\">Moreh Nevuchim</a>, Rambam explains how God's attributes should be understood without compromising God's unchangingness.</p>\n\n<p>He compares God's mood to a fire. If you put ice in a fire, it melts, then evaporates. If you put clay in a fire, it hardens. If you put wood in a fire it burns... The fire causes many different and contrasting effects without changing the fire's properties. The same \"fire melts certain things and makes others hard, it boils and burns, it bleaches and blackens.\" It is the properties of each individual material that elicit a different interactions with fire. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, our actions change properties within ourselves, and it's those changes that elicit different interactions from God, without God changing.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Rambam explains that God's \"jealousy and wrath, kindle His fire and anger\" are reactions solely elicited by idolatry. By worshiping idols, one makes them-self an enemy and adversary of God.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think \"happy\" is a word we can use to describe God, it's a human/time-related state of mind. If you follow God's commandments though, He will turn His face to you - meaning Hashem will pay specific attention to you, and watch out for you. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>God is beyond time and he cannot change or be affected by our actions. Whenever the Torah describes an emotion of God, there is always an action that takes place in this world with it.  So a person may sin, \"God gets angry at the person\", and the person is punished. The meaning of God's anger can be understood as the punishment the person received. God still has will for this world, but He does not have time-bound \"emotions\" in response to people's actions.

Accordingly, their sins would be converted to Mitzvoth.</p>\n\n<p>Satan is thus in a quandary: for every sin he brings up against the Jews, is subject to possible conversion to a good deed, which moves Hashem to shower blessing upon the Jews, the opposite of Satan's goal.

Exactly what qualifies as \"difficult\" should be asked of a competent, orthodox rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>So likely someone who says \"prohibited <em>l'chat'chila</em>\" is transferring that extra connotation from the realm of actively fulfilling commands to the realm of prohibitions, and means \"prohibited except in a situation of difficulty\" (where, again, \"difficulty\" would need to be assessed by a rabbi). But it'd be best to confirm that meaning with whoever is using the phrase.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Peanut butter Bracha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What Brochah or Blessing is said when eating plain Peanut butter? Does the chunky variety (with pieces) versus regular make a difference?</p>\n\n<p>I am referring to a case where it is eaten on a spoon, with no other additional items. Also, assume I had not washed for a meal at an  earlier time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>There is a list in the back of the <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/seder-bircas-hanehenin-seder-ntilas-yodoyim-lsuda-rabbi-schneur-zalman-of-liadi/1026236992\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English translation of the Baal Hatanya's Seder Bircas Hanehenin/Seder N'tilas Yodoyim L'S'Uda </a> (translated by Shimon D. Cowen).</p>\n\n<p>On page 168, it says that smooth is Shehakol and chunky is Ha'adama. He then continues <em>\"However, there is a type in which the majority is smooth with pieces, the b'rocho is than as the majority, Shehakol.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>The sources he uses for this are Baal Hatanya's Seder Bircas Hanehenin (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&pgnum=742\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7:24</a> for smooth, and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&pgnum=742\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7:22</a> for crunchy). </p>\n\n<p>There are however, two things to clarify before deciding which Beracha to make:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>See <a href=\"http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Peanut-Butter.html#ixzz1YvljrBV5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> that describes the process for making peanut butter. In it, it describes two ways of making chunky peanut butter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"To make chunky peanut butter, peanut pieces approximately the size of one-eighth of a kernel are mixed with regular peanut butter, or incomplete grinding is used by removing a rib from the grinder.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this, it would appear that if the brand makes chunky peanut butter <em>\"by removing a rib from the grinder\"</em>, the chunky peanut butter would be Ha'adama.</p>\n\n<p>However, there may be many companies whose crunchy peanut butter is smooth peanut butter with pieces mixed in. See for example, Skippy's website, where they <a href=\"http://www.peanutbutter.com/products.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">explicitly say</a> <em>\"Skippy Super Chunk has loads of real peanut pieces blended into every jar of great tasting peanut butter\"</em>. </p>\n\n<p>If so, it would appear that there could be many chunky peanut butters made with that process and would therefore be Shehakol.</p></li>\n<li><p>Also, if you read the sources, the Baal Hatanya is saying that the reason why we say Shehakol is because there is an argument between the Magen Avraham and the Taz about whether completely changing the form of a food would make it Shehakol. The Magen Avraham says yes, unless the food is grown for that purpose. The Taz says it retains the original beracha unless the changed form can be elevated (e.g. grain is Ha'adama. Grind it up and it becomes Shehakol, because it could be used to make bread). The Baal Hatanya concludes that we should say Shehakol to fulfill our obligation according to everyone (But if you said Ha'adama you fulfilled you obligation Bedieved).</p>\n\n<p>That being the case, it's possible that these days most peanuts are grown for peanut butter, and if so, maybe everyone would agree that even smooth peanut butter would be Ha'adama, even though it is completely pureed.</p>\n\n<p>(As discussed <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1412/discussion-between-menachem-and-yydl\">here</a>, it appears that R' Bodner discusses this on page 410 in his book, \"Halachos of brochos\" [based on the tail end of a footnote on <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=J1eqIHzglmEC&lpg=PP1&dq=inauthor%3a%22Yisroel%20Pinchos%20Bodner%22&pg=PA411#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">page 411</a>]. However, that page is missing from the Google Books version, so I can't look up exactly what it says. If someone has a copy of the book, can they look it up and tell us what it says?)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.brochos.com/item/10581\">here</a> which quotes Laws of B'rachos that the proper bracha on both chunky and creamy varieties of peanut butter are Hoadama / Borei Nefashos.</p>\n\n<p>However, it appears it is actually a machlokes. I see <a href=\"http://www.mevaseret.org/mmy/searchshiurim.php?shiur=254\">here</a> quote both Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rav Elyashiv that it's Shehakol.</p>\n\n<p>I have also seen some lists online that seem to imply there <em>is</em> a difference between chunky and creamy, but I have not been able to identify a source for this.</p>\n\n<p>As always, CYLOR before making a practical decision.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://torah.net/eng/kids/brachot/broch5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a>, the halacha is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chunky Peanut Butter---Ha'adamah---Boray Nefashot</li>\n<li>Creamy Peanut Butter---Shehakol---Boray Nefashot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://www.berachot.org/halacha/19_changing.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> it says that some hold that creamy peanut butter is also Ha'adamah.</p>\n<p>As usual, CYLOR for practical halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Polyphasic Sleep and Halacha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently read <a href=\"http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/\">an article</a> on polyphasic sleep and I'm quite interested in experimenting with it. The article advises the Uberman approach which advocates 20-30 minute naps every four hours, meaning that you sleep about 2-3 hours per 24 hour period. I'm also interested in trying the Dymaxion approach which advocates 30 minute naps every 6 hours. The interesting thing is that eventually, you  reach the point at which you get a full REM cycle every time you take a nap. It seems that from mouths of the people who do this and establish polyphasic sleep patterns, they have more energy and higher alertness. </p>\n\n<p>The first and foremost question is whether one is allowed to do this out of the possibility of self-harm. For this and for the other questions, I'll be consulting my Rav. </p>\n\n<p>Next comes the halachic aspects of berachos and the like. Since I'll only be sleeping 20 to 30 minutes each time, here's where the questions come in. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If I'm only sleeping for 20 to 30 minutes, do I wash my hands when I wake?\n<ul>\n<li>I remember there being something about the minimum length of sleep required in order to wash, and I'm not really sure what that minimum is. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>When it comes to only sleeping for two or three (depending on sleep schedule) short periods in the night, when should I make my birchos hashachar and birchos hatorah? \n<ul>\n<li>I'll probably be studying Torah and doing other Torah-related things during the night, possibly before and possibly after chatzos. Let's give an example of this for clarity:</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Do I just say Krias Shema Al Hamita only the first time I go to bed during the night? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Nap Schedule</h3>\n\n<pre>\n  Nap Start Time | Nap End Time \n-----------------|---------------\n| 7:40pm         | 8:00pm       |\n| 11:40pm        | 12:00am      |\n| 3:40am         | 4:00am       |\n| 7:40am         | 8:00am       |\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Zmanim Schedule</h3>\n\n<pre>\n  Zman Name     | Zman Time     \n----------------|----------------\n| Nightfall     | 8:00pm        |\n| Midnight      | 12:00am       |\n| Dawn (Alos)   | 4:00am        |\n</pre>\n\n<p>Of course, the contrived example above is overly simplified and isn't necessarily real, but it should help to serve as an example. Can one give an answer on my three questions above given the above example? I'd like to be able to try this, but I need to be clear on what the halacha is so that in my sleeplessness, I don't transgress. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You wash your hands before davenings and with a bracha only before the shacharit one (assuming you have gone to the bathroom since davening maariv which seems highly likely)</p></li>\n<li><p>You never say Birkot Hatorah as you never really take a break.

Also, I've heard that from 10 pm to 2 am is the best time to be asleep since it helps you \"recover\" better.\nAlso, sleeping less can manytimes make you lethargic and while you may get more hours, you'll lose the quality of the hours, adding up to basically the same amount of productivity you had when you slept more hours, but with health risks.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to blow a t'rua\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How does one effect a <em>t'rua</em> when blowing a <em>shofar</em> on <em>Rosh Hashana</em>? The airflow must be stopped and started repeatedly in a short time, but it can, I suppose, be stopped either</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop\" rel=\"noreferrer\">glottis</a>,</li>\n<li>at the narrow end of the <em>shofar</em> (by blocking it with the tongue), or</li>\n<li>anywhere in between (say, by effecting a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_stop\" rel=\"noreferrer\">velar stop</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>— or, indeed, not by blocking the flow of air but simply</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>by repeatedly pausing exhalation with the diaphragm.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is/are any of these mandated/barred by <em>halacha</em>? Which is/are commonly used or not used, and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The sefer \"<a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/authors/reit-avrohom/teka-beshofar.html\">Teka BeShofar</a>\" says that there are two methods for producing a teruah: \"The common way,\" and \"the simple way.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Common Way: Air stream is held steady, and the sounds are formed by moving the tongue in and out of the shofar's opening. This is the most natural way, but it has two drawbacks: 1) Most people cannot do this fast enough to form the sounds properly; 2) It runs a serious risk of filling the shofar with spittle.</p>\n\n<p>The Simple Way: Tongue never comes near the shofar. Rather, continuously strike the tongue against the roof of the mouth, as if to make a \"Tee\" or \"Too\" sound. The Syrian teruah has minimal break between the sounds, and is produced by using \"li\" instead of \"tee\". [The Yekkishe teruah (Frankfurt-on-Main) is warbled, with no break at all, and the modulation is controlled from the lungs. Very difficult to do without experience.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While not directly answering your last question,  I myself have done it two ways.  One is by using my tongue to block and then unblock the airflow to the shofar.  Blocking the shofar with your tongue directly tastes really bad, so just bringing the tongue to the top of your mouth is easier.  It's also the most common way of doing it.</p>\n\n<p>However for myself, I find that using my diaphram as if I am heavily sobbing or laughing has a more consistent sound as well as being less prone to error.  My kavanah is also stronger when doing it that way as it reminds me more of Sisra's mother :)  It also requires much more practice to be able to do it that way in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the reason of a minimum of 4 days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah (OC 581:5) explains: many people have the custom to fast for ten days (including Yom Kippur) as part of seeking repentance (Levush). Starting from Rosh haShannah you lose at least four days: the two days of Rosh haShannah, Shabbat Shuvah (the Shabbat in between Rosh haShannah and Yom Kipppur) and the day before Yom Kippur (when it is forbidden to fast). Thus, the fasting would precede Rosh haShannah by at least four days. And the selichot would be done on days when you are fasting (another custom).</p>\n\n<p>A second explanation from the Mishnah Berurah: animals offered for sacrifice in the temple needed verification that they were free of blemishes for four days before they were offered. And on Rosh haShannah it says ועשיתם עולה (instead of והקרבתם עולה, which it says by all the other sacrifices) from which we learn that a person should consider themselves to be like a korban olah on Rosh haShannah. Thus we begin our spiritual introspection at least four days prior.</p>\n\n\n",

Accordingly, R' Moshe rules that non-<em>mevushal</em> wine such a person touches is forbidden (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&pgnum=214\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Igros Moshe</em> YD vol. 2, §132</a>).</p>\n\n<p>R' Yosef Messas (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22015&st=&pgnum=256\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Otzar HaMichtavim</em> 2:1302</a>, h/t @Maimonist) discusses a circumstance in which he rules that the wine of public Shabbos violators would be permitted: </p>\n\n<p>Although R' Messas is generally lenient when it comes to the laws governing wine of non-Jews (such as to permit liquor made from non-Jewish wine, see <em>Otzar HaMichtavim</em> 1:454,462), he affirms that public Shabbos violators would generally render wine forbidden through contact. </p>\n\n<p>However, after noting the abundance of Shabbos violators and the great degree to which the communal life of religious and partially religious (but Shabbos violating) Jews was intertwined,<sup>1</sup> R' Messas makes an allowance for the wine. The reason he gives is that prohibiting the wine would be taken as a grave insult that would disrupt the great communal unity in their communities and instead create massive strife. He adds that prohibiting their wine would cause the Shabbos violating Jews to be resentful and totally abandon Judaism and any religious observance. He also mentions that provoking the animosity of the less observant Jews could lead to a severely damaging backlash against the Shabbos observant Jews.</p>\n\n<p>R' Messas' would apparently extend this allowance to any community where treating the wine of Shabbos violators as prohibited would cause this sort of discord, as he mentions that one may actively countermand a rabbinic prohibition for the sake of avoiding strife.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>This responsum was sent in 1939 from Algeria (probably from the Jewish community of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlemcen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tlemcen</a>) to the Jewish community in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenitra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kenitra, Morocco</a>.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>One may actively countermand a rabbinic prohibition for the sake of <em>kavod hab'riyos</em> (\"human dignity\"; see, for example, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=19b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 19b</a>). R' Messas rules that one may do the same in order to avoid strife, but the basis for this is less clear. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%A1%D7%92%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yehuda Segal</a> (<em>Tzemach Yehuda</em> 3:59), for example, appears to rule that this allowance does not extend to actively overriding a rabbinic law to avoid strife: \"וכבוד הבריות שנדחה היינו באם בזה גופא יש כבוד הבריות ולא שהוא יעשה מחלוקת ואיהו עיוות נפשיה\". The Ritva (<em>Shabbos</em> 23b) says that peace and harmony alone allow one to use candles for lighting the home instead of lighting Chanuka candles (thus failing to perform a rabbinic obligation by default), but even the Ritva doesn't go so far as to say that one may actively violate a rabbinic law for peace. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sub>On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Saul_Nathansohn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sho'eil U'Meishiv</em></a> (vol. 2, 3:106, \"וגדול כבוד הבריות ובפרט בזמנינו קשה המחלוקת\") might possibly be understood to halachically link the two. Likewise, it is possible that the Maharam miRothenburg may be understood to permit violating most rabbinic restrictions for the sake of peace (§758, where he upholds the rabbinic prohibition against annulling oaths made in HaShem's name even in the face of an impending divorce. It seems that his reasoning is that there was a particular exigency in upholding that rabbinic restriction - since people were being too flippant with oaths - that outweighed the special importance of fostering domestic harmony).</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In order to avoid situations of mixed-marriages , which almost certainly lead to assimilation , the Rabbis enacted many decrees whose goal was to inhibit the forming of close relationships between Jews and non-Jews.  The laws of stam yeinam (wine that was produced or handled by Non-Jews) are included in these decrees.  On the other hand, the Torah, and in its footsteps, the Rabbis, wanted to encourage close relationships amongst Jews, and they therefore established that a single witness is believed regarding prohibitions.  The Yerushalmi  explains that this was done in order to enable Jews to conveniently eat and drink with their fellow Jews.\nLet us therefore preface our response with some of the principles and basic laws regarding wine and when a non-Jew comes in contact with it, only afterwards will we deal with the issue of wine that comes in contact with a Jew.\nEven if a non-Jew opens a bottle of wine, the contents are not prohibited .  If a non-Jew pours a cup of wine, according to many opinions, the wine is prohibited , while some opinions are lenient if a monetary loss, even a small one, is involved .  There is also a dispute regarding the permissibility of the wine that remains in the bottle .  Even those who are stringent will permit the wine if a large loss would otherwise be incurred . \nAll this is regarding natural wine, but cooked wine was never included in the prohibition .  There is a dispute amongst contemporary Rabbis if the pasteurization process renders the wine as cooked  or not , one can be lenient, since this is a doubt on a rabbinic prohibition. \nNow we will explain the law regarding wine that was poured by a non-religious Jew .\nIf he would open a bottle of wine, the wine is certainly permitted, as was mentioned earlier regarding a non-Jew, all the more so when it is opened by a Jew.  If a non-religious Jew pours a cup of wine , if he is the type of Jew who does not fulfill the ritual commandments (bein adam LaMakom), since that is how he was educated and raised from a young age , then the wine does not become prohibited by his pouring or his touch.\nHowever, if he declares about himself that he willingly is a non-believer as the result of his investigations and searches , and he publically violates Shabbat, meaning he violates Shabbat even in front of a great person , then he is considered as someone who is a heretic on the entire Torah , and the wine would be prohibited.\nIn any case where there is a doubt as to his status, one may be lenient, as is the case with every doubt on a rabbinic prohibition.\nA full response in Hebrew with sources can be found Bemareh Habazak volume 7 siman 62: \n<a href=\"http://eretzhemdah.org/data/uploadedfiles/ebooks/36-sfile.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://eretzhemdah.org/data/uploadedfiles/ebooks/36-sfile.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n",

If I recall correctly, Lord Sacks has said something similar.</p></li>\n<li>Recall as well that a slave had to be treated decently, and was given a quasi-conversion and had to keep kashrut, shabbat, and quite a bit more. Not all of the commandments, but a lot of them. Upon being freed, a slave's status was the same as a convert's. When you seriously think about just how depraved a lot of societies were in the time of the Bible, Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald suggests that while harsh, this may have been a way of civilizing people. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>At the heart of the slavery issue are the questions: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>To whom do you belong?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If your body belong to yourself, can you do whatever you want with your body? </li>\n<li><p>If you can choose to do whatever you want with your body, does that include sell it?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Also, if I'm in debt, cant I sell myself as a slave to work off my debt?</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>How do these questions differ between Jews and Gentiles?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As Jews, our bodies are considered Hashem's property. We were once upon a time free-men who owned ourselves, but we became slaves to the Egyptians, and while Hashem redeemed us from them, we are still slaves to Hashem. As a result, like the land of Israel, which is also ultimately God's property, we are not allowed to permanently sell ourselves, only as 'indentured-servants' to each-other for our debts, and for no-more than 6 years. Since our bodies don't belong to ourselves, we also can't get tattoos or make a cut in our flesh, eat whatever we want and many more restrictions. It's a direct result of Hashem being our Master that prevents Jews from selling them-selves. If Jews weren't already slaves to Hashem, Jews would be allowed to sell themselves as slaves. </p>\n\n<p>Gentiles on the other hand are their own proprietors. They were never redeemed by Hashem, so they still own themselves, and can do whatever they want with their bodies, therefore they are allowed to sell themselves as property, if their laws allow for it. Hashem won't change gentile-laws, but he did the next best thing by making a blanket emancipation for any gentile-slave who wants to escape their gentile-master. He can escape to Israel where, under Jewish law, he would be protected as a free-man. </p>\n\n<p>A Jew is not permitted to sell a gentile-slave to a gentile. If he does, that slave must be re-purchased and granted freedom. </p>\n\n<p>A Jew is only allowed to purchase a gentile-slave if he agrees to be circumcised. Circumcision is an acceptance that Hashem is the only God and it's a sign that Hashem is our Master. Basically, this is a light-conversion, where the slave accepts that Hashem is his master as well. This gives the gentile-slave a huge deterrent, and a real choice of whether or not to become a slave to a Jew, especially since he can always refuse circumcision and escape to Israel where he would be protected as a free man. </p>\n\n<p>If a gentile does want to undergo circumcision and become a slave to a Jew, in return for his servitude, the slave must be provided with sustenance. There is no official law dictating how a Jewish-slave-owner must treat his gentile-slave (similarly there is no law against yelling at or hitting your wife and children.), because as an adult the law can't tell you how to use your property, however, it is taught that gentile-slaves should be treated as humanely as possible, even partaking in every meal the master eats, before the master himself eats. He should never be embarrassed or distressed, over-worked, or shouted at, and one should speak to them gently and listen to their claims. Their main purpose is to perform a service, not 'be your slave'. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think there's always a perspective missing from these questions and answers. We always ask the question from the perspective of the \"slave owner.\" We don't usually ask, why did so many people often sell themselves into slavery.</p>\n<p>The ancient world was harsher than we typically allow ourselves to imagine. Because if we actually imagined how bad the world was, we'd have to admit how different we ourselves would be. No one in our modern age considers selling their children. Whereas not even that long ago selling one child when you couldn't feed the other 4 was very much something people considered.</p>\n<p>God doesn't remove slavery because in the ancient world, sometimes becoming a slave was the best outcome. Guaranteed housing and food, payment once you left, etc etc.</p>\n<p>Is slavery even close to the best outcome in our day? Certainly not! Just like we no longer have a strong need for brothers to marry the wife of their deceased sibling, or offer a rape victim to marry the person who raped them.... We are so lucky to live in a world where slavery no longer needs to be considered a solution to a problem.</p>\n\n\n",

This means that they never had the full prophetic experience that Moses would achieve, and that they didn't get to see the \"beyond-time\" existence of G-d that Moses would.

Successful, Moses goes on to try to better understand G-d (which our commentaries say includes understanding G-d's ways; both forgiveness for bad things, and bad things happening to good people). But the only way to know the mind of G-d is to be G-d, and we are human and finite, so Moses goes <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=34\">farther than any other human with his success</a>, but still only so far. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You don't need to know God's name to know that there <em>is</em> a god whom you should be paying attention to.

The midrash implies it but torah never tells us; as @Shalom said, the torah itself doesn't explain why God chose Avraham (or Moshe or Yisrael), just that He did.</p>\n\n<p>Summary of the midrash from <a href=\"http://cellio.livejournal.com/584351.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">my notes after a class</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mashal: One day a man was traveling and he saw a tower (birah) \"on fire\" (doleket).

And ha-Kadosh Baruch Hu peeked out at him, saying: I am the ruler of this world. According to this midrash, God didn't reveal himself to Avraham until Avraham deduced that the world must have a creator/ruler and went looking. Avraham was a seeker; God didn't just speak to him out of the blue and say \"lech l'cha\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to sum up, God chose Avraham because Avraham was perceptive/curious enough to seek out the Master of the Universe.</p>\n\n\n",

Now the Bible says that Passover should be in the spring, and if you keep having years of 354 days you'll keep sliding backwards until Passover won't be in the spring anymore, so every so often they'd add a leap month. Sure, other peoples may have had lunar calendars too, but nothing pagan or Babylonian per se here.</p>\n\n<p>In the books of Moses, the months are simply called \"first month\", \"second month\", and so on. Passover is in the first month, Yom Kippur in the seventh. Nothing pagan or Babylonian here yet either.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the period of the Judges and First Temple (let's say very roughly from 3500 to 2500 years ago), we occasionally see the Bible use Hebrew names for some of the months (such as \"Ziv\"), instead of just the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The names that most of us are familiar with are, in fact, the Babylonian names. When the Jews were exiled to Babylon (roughly 2500 years ago) and came back (roughly 2400 years ago), the Jews chose to stick with Babylonian <em>names</em> for the months of the <em>same calendar the Jews had been using for centuries.</em></p>\n\n<p>So we didn't pick a Babylonian calendar; but we adopted Babylonian nicknames for the months.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest explanation for that was to specifically commemorate the exodus from Babylon, to remind the people that we weren't <em>always</em> in Israel.

This is parallel to the command regarding the new month and setting up of the calendar that came about with the redemption from the Egyption exile (see there, in Shemos/Exodus ch. 12). This reason (in slightly different forms) is also given by <strong>Rabbeinu Bachya</strong> and the <strong>Abarbanel</strong> in their commentaries there, as well as by <strong>R.

Yerucham Fishel Perlow</strong> (Sefer Mitzvos of Rasag, end of Aseh 56) seems to say that we shouldn't read to much into this practice; it was borne merely out of convenience that the Jews were in Babylonia, so they used Babylonian names, and it was just easier to keep those names even after leaving. (In fact, historically speaking much of the Jewish people remained in Babylonia anyway, and it was probably easier if everyone used the same dating system)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>R. Yaakov Kamenetsky</strong> (Emes L'Yaakov Shemos 12:2) has almost the opposite explanation: the Babylonian names of the months were kept when the Jews moved from Babylonia/Persia to Israel to remind them that this redemption was incomplete.

Philistines were not larger than Israelites, the giant and his family was a genetic anomaly. Not all Philistines had acromegaly.</p>\n<p>The chapter you cite shows the gigantism was in this Gittite family, the father Goliath was slain by Elhanan the son of Jaare and his son became a champion of the Philistines, whom David slew many according to the Mechon Mamre link above, pasukim 19-22.</p>\n<p>The generation of Israel coming in from the desert may have been smaller because they were almost exclusively vegetarian, eating maan, and they do tend to be shorter at least if limited zinc/protein/iron is available before puberty like the Persian and Egyptian dwarves. <a href=\"http://www.ifm.net/industry/zinc2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.ifm.net/industry/zinc2.htm</a>   Once in the land, eating meat, they were the same size as everyone else in the region.

So David is saying \"there won't be left alive even one thing-that-urinates-against-the-wall.\" </p>\n\n<p>The classical commentaries say that means either a male human being, or a dog.

I was taught that the Gemara was \"closed\" and may no longer be challenged in terms of its Halachic authority.  To what extent is this authority binding, and when can it be overruled (if at all)?</p>\n\n<p>In the same vein, I would like answers to the question pertaining to the Halachic authority of the Geonim, Rishonim and Aḥaronim.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, does this authority carry over to modern books?  If I have a book on Kashruth that cites the Mishnah Berurah and/or Shulḥan 'Aruch and maybe a couple of other sources that \"have authority\", does that mean I have to follow what this book says?  Is there no room to find another opinion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemarah is binding on all Jews <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?rambamChapters=3&tDate=3/30/2011#footnoteRef6a901700\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">because</a> that was the last work that was accepted by all Jews as binding. Since then, as Jews spread around the world,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>individuals, the remnants whom God called, would gather in each city and country, occupy themselves in Torah study, and [devote themselves] to understanding the texts of the Sages and learning the path of judgment from them.</p>\n<p>Every court that was established after the conclusion of the Talmud, regardless of the country in which it was established, issued decrees, enacted ordinances, and established customs for the people of that country - or those of several countries. These practices, however, were not accepted throughout the Jewish people, because of the distance between [their different] settlements and the disruption of communication [between them].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So after the writing of the Gemara, there was no more \"final\" work binding on all Jewry. However, within individual communities there were works whose rulings were considered final.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=33&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> there is a contradiction between a Mishna and a Braisa. The Mishna says that if a judge made an incorrect ruling and then realized that he made a mistake, the ruling is reversed and the winner must pay back the money to the loser. However, the Braisa says that the winner keeps the money but the judge must pay from his own pocket. The Gemara says several resolutions, and one of them is that the mishna is referring to a mistake in a \"dvar mishna\" (a rule mentioned in the Mishna) while the Braisa is referring to a mistake \"bshikul hadaas\" (in a judgement call). The Gemara goes on to say that one who made a mistake in a ruling of Rav Chiya and Rav Oshiya, Rav and Shmuel, and Rav Sheishes and Rav Asi (all of whom were sages from the time of the Gemarah and not the Mishna) also is considered as to making a mistake in a \"dvar mishna\". The Gemarah goes on to ask \"What is a mistake in 'Shikul Hadaas'?\" and the Gemarah answers \"If there is an argument between two Tanayim or two Amorayim and the argument (\"Sugya\") seems to go in favor of one of them and the judge ruled like the other\".</p>\n<p>So the Gemara defines two types of mistakes: \"A mistake in a judgement call\" which means that since the opinion like whom the judge ruled was not completely rejected, the loser can tell the judge \"I hold like that opinion, and Hamotzei Mchaveiro Alav Haraya ('Bring proof that I am wrong and I will return the money')\". Since that opinion is technically a legitimate opinion the winner doesn't have to give back the money.</p>\n<p>However, the second type of mistake, a \"mistake against a mishna\" is not a legitimate ruling. It is a complete mistake without any foundation and the winner must give back the money. This type of mistake is not just when a judge ruled against a mishna, but when he ruled like a Tanna whose opinion was rejected from Halacha (like Beis Shammai).</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, since the sealing of the Gemara, no later authority has the right to argue on it or add anything to it. Moreover, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14271&st=&pgnum=75\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the time of the Rishonim</a>, the words of the Gaonim were considered as binding as a \"dvar mishna\".</p>\n<p>Generally what comes out of all of this is that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One cannot disagree with the Gemarah</li>\n<li>One can argue on a Gaon, though only with very strong proof, and if one ruled against one without proog, he is not considered to have made a psak din.</li>\n<li>One has to lchatchila rule according to the traditions in his community. In some communities (Yemenites), the poskim generally rule like the Rambam. Other(Sfardim) rule (generally) like the Shulchan Aruch of the Beis Yosef. Others (Ashkenazi) rule (in general) like the Rama. Some communities (like Chabad), <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7720&st=&pgnum=6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rule like the Shulchan Aruch Harav</a>. Some (the Yeshivishe velt, as well as most of the \"chareidi\" circles) rule like the Mishna Brura.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is another reason why being a posek is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10147/what-is-the-meaning-of-psak/10163#10163\">more</a> than just learning the materials.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam (cited in tom smith's answer) explains that after the Talmud Bavli was written, the Jews became dispersed and could not learn like before and forgot many things. Therefore, the Talmud became the accepted final word from when Torah was clearer. However, no other written work carries the same authority as the Mishnah and Talmud did. This may be because once Torah sheBal Peh was allowed to be written, forgetting Torah became a less major issue, so the previous generations did not have as big an 'advantage' over later ones. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the rishonim generally did not accept the words of the Geonim as binding (see comment). However, the Rishonim eventually became accepted as authoritative by the achronim. This may be due partially to the traditions the Rishonim had, but also because if no one raised any objections for a few hundred years, it must be pretty solid. In addition, things eventually become accepted for their precedent, just as a secular court's rulings are usually accepted by a later court. The achronim have not yet achieved the status of the rishonim, but few poskim will argue alone against a major achron. However, R' Moshe Feinstein discusses how he rules based on his own reasoning and sometimes will argue on major achronim, because that is the way of the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>No one considers any modern book as authoritative. Just because something is written, that does not make it true. However, the shulchan aruch was accepted by the Jewish people, so no current authority would go against it on his own, though there are cases where the \"nosei kelim\" argue with its rulings.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Michael Berger deals with this issue at length in his book, <em>Rabbinic Authority : The Authority of the Talmudic Sages.</em>  I highly recommend that you acquire it and read the eighth chapter, titled \"The Authority of Texts.\"</p>\n\n<p>You can find his book on <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0195122690\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a> or in a <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/rabbinic-authority/oclc/37588458\" rel=\"nofollow\">library</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(I may provide a fuller answer at a later point.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the Bible contain many instances of group or tribal punishment and guilt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many instances in the Bible where God or prophets state in God's name that a group or tribe is punished for the wrong-doing of a single individual. How is this just?</p>\n\n<p>A perfect example is where Achan stole some gold that was to be given to the temple for God's honour (Joshua 7:1-13). Joshua and all the elders tear their clothes, fall on their faces, and put dust on their heads. They perform this rite because the Israelites lost a battle. God was punishing them because one man, Achan, \"took of the accursed thing.\" I wonder what \"the accursed thing\" was.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I'm not sure I can account for all instances of this, however in general the punishment (or rather, responsibility) applies to the group for <em>their</em> fault in the wrongdoing, not the wrongdoing itself.    </p>\n\n<p>This could include a collective culture that lead to the one person doing something wrong; lack of education on right and wrong; the community did not automatically right the wrong that was done (such as in the case of Achan - see <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%96_%D7%90\"><em>M'tzudat David</em> on 7:1</a>), and so forth.   </p>\n\n<p>This can be seen most clearly in the laws of <em>egla arufah</em> - the case where the elders of a city are responsible for bringing a special sacrifice, on finding an anonymous murder victim outside the city area. While the elders themselves are of course not suspected of being directly responsible for the murder, they still held <em>indirectly</em> responsible: either for not being hospitable to the victim, which led to him wandering outside the city; or for not yet catching and punishing the real murderer. (though there are also other explanations.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Btw, I will admit that there are certain cases where the above does not apply, but we cannot really understand all the factors in heavenly punishment.<br>\nOne case, though, might lead to a wider understanding: consider the case of <em>Amalek</em>, of whom G-d said He will destroy the entire people for attacking the Israelites on their way out of the Egyptian exile. However, on further perusal, it might be said that the destruction of all Amalekites is not necesarily because of that act, but rather the <em>characteristics</em> of the people which caused them to do so. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To supplement AviD's answer, also note that many instances of punishment in the Bible actually amount to letting things take their natural course. Indeed, for this reason the expression often used is that G-d \"hides His face.\"</p>\n\n<p>Consider your example, of Achan's sin and its consequences at the battle of Ai. Why indeed are Joshua and the elders going to pieces over one lost skirmish, and thirty-six casualties out of a force of two or three thousand soldiers? Any good general would probably remain stoic in the face of a much higher loss rate.</p>\n\n<p>But the reason was that they knew that the conquest of the land of Canaan was <em>not</em> to be a regular military campaign following the usual laws of probability. If that were the case, then indeed they wouldn't stand a chance; \"you [the Jews] are strong, but they [the Canaanites] are stronger than you\" (Rashi to Deut. 11:23). So it would require divine aid every step of the way. And to deserve such supernatural aid would require them to maintain a super standard of behavior, such that out of a nation of millions, not one person would take something to which he or she is not entitled. (Bear in mind, too, that we're not even talking about stealing someone else's property; Achan's sin was taking property that was \"banned\" and \"accursed\" - i.e., slated for destruction.) So if that standard can't be upheld - and it doesn't matter whether it's one person or a thousand who are violating it, because it is a corporate national responsibility - then things revert to their normal course. And the normal course is indeed that a weaker army, not on its home turf, is going to lose. That's what upset the leaders so much: the realization that if the Jews can depend only on their own military might, then it's not just the one city of Ai that might hold out - the whole enterprise of conquering the Land is bound to fail.</p>\n\n<p>To take another example, much of the Bible is full of prophetic warnings that the sinful behavior of the Jewish people (or segments thereof) is going to lead to foreign conquest, exile and destruction. Here, too, consider: is that a \"punishment\" or simply what's to be expected geopolitically? A small country with a largely agricultural population, sandwiched between two powerful empires and a bridge between three continents, is naturally going to be prey for one side or the other, if not both in a pincer movement. What kept Israel as an independent state for 800+ years - from Joshua's conquest to the Assyrian and Babylonian takeovers - was, again, G-d's protection. And again, for them to deserve that - to buck the history of every other nation in the world - required them to act as a nation that indeed is distinct from all of those other nations, and to make sure that every member of that \"corporation\" is aware of his or her duties and upholds them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara (very end of Sukkah) gives a different example: the group of Kohanim called Bilgah was punished, according to one opinion, because of a single person, Miriam bas Bilgah. The Gemara asks exactly your question: why should everyone be punished for the actions of an individual? It answers: \"oy l'rasha, oy l'shecheino; tov l'tzadik, tov l'shecheino,\" woe to the wicked, woe to their neighbors; good to the righteous, good to their neighbors. Rashi to the incident of Korach uses this same p'shat to explain why it was specifically Shevet Reuven that got sucked into Korach's rebellion: Bnei Kehas and Reuven were next to each other in the formation of the camps. I have heard many shi'urim that link oy l'rasha oy l'shecheino to areivim kol Yisrael zeh lazeh, everyone is responsible for one another (Shevuos 39a), which I believe is how Rashi explains the incident of Achan.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, R' Moshe's teshuva doesn't cover a case where there is no benefit/interaction with the device until <em>after</em> Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=94\">O.C. IV 60</a>) strongly disagreed with the use of timers.  His strongest definite reason is that </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>its usage is a disgrace to shabbos, since through their use one can run a business and circumvent shabbos.  This is a Torah violation of \"honoring shabbos\".  (Contrast this with placing a pot on the stove right before shabbos, where that is the final action.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other reasons to not permit timers is that the sages certainly would have forbid its use </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>because of its ability to circumvent shabbos</p></li>\n<li><p>because it is effectively similar (and worse) than requesting a non-jew to perform the act</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since historically there had been those who permitted lighting lamps through a non-jew, Rav Moshe allowed timers on lights as a continuation of that tradition.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lights:</strong>  Yes</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coffee:</strong>  No</p>\n\n<p><strong>TV:</strong>      No, plus it makes noise, so it would be forbidden under a type of \"maris ayin\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other devices:</strong>  This teshuva doesn't cover devices that were actually started before shabbos, don't make noise and don't really do anything on shabbos.  For example, if one runs his computer over shabbos, but it's not really doing anything, that is certainly different than setting it to go on on shabbos.  Setting updates would be a good question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>You can use an electric timer to turn your lights on and off, where manipulating the lights directly would not be permitted.  A computer seems like just a specialized case of this, so long as you are not interacting with the computer on Shabbat/Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>As @tom smith notes in a comment, if the <em>effect</em> of your programmed computer use would lead people to think you had done, rather than programmed, the action on Shabbat/Yom Tov, that's problematic.  Using a computer to control your coffee maker is one thing; using it to post to J.SE is another. :-)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/DAAT/english/Journal/broyde_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">daat.ac.il</a>: </p>\n\n<p><sup>(Non-quoted paragraphs are ones I have summarized from that page.)</sup><br>\nThe discussion seems to center around the following Halacha (SA 252:1).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is permitted to start an action on Friday near darkness even though the work cannot be completed on Friday and can only be finished on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara (Shabbos 18a) records a dispute between Rava and R' Yosef about whether this applies to noisy [i.e., public and obvious] things, like leaving grain in a watermill on Friday. The Mechaber rules leniently, like R' Yosef, while the Rema is stringent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Based on this stricture of the Ramo, there are some who claim that using a timer on Shabbat should be prohibited when it creates audible or visible action. For example, absent some significant need, both Rabbi Feinstein and Rabbi Auerbach (Minchat Shlomo pp. 68-69) agree that this rule prohibits one from playing a radio on Shabbat even if it is left on for all of Shabbat. Placing a radio on a timer is analogous to putting wheat into a water mill. Both cause noise on Shabbat and arouse suspicion that its owner has violated the laws of Shabbat. Hence, they rule that it is rabbinically prohibited to set a radio on a timer or to let it run the entire Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other rabbonim have given other reasons to forbid it. Some compare it to placing a dish around a sparking flame, which is forbidden due to the concern that one might forget and adjust it, accidentally extinguishing the flame. Others say that one may begin an activity on Friday that continues on Shabbos, provided one does not benefit from it on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The consensus of the achronim as well as the accepted practice is not in harmony with any of the opinions which prohibit timers</strong> [emphasis mine].  As the Encyclopedia Talmudit (\"Electricity\" 18:679) states:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Many of the achronim permit one to set a Shabbat clock on Friday - and this is the common practice - even those who prohibit creating a sound permit the use of timers... since all know that these timers are set before Shabbat.\n    Essentially, since it has become common practice to use timers, there is no appearance of impropriety when timers are used. This approach has been accepted by most contemporary decisors such as Rabbi Waldenberg, Rabbi Breisch, Rabbi Henkin, Rabbi Auerbach, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the Chazon Ish, Maharam Schick and many others.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many relevent footnotes and sources there.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the Hebrew alphabet not have letters representing vowels?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Hebrew alphabet is actually an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">abjad</a> rather than a \"true\" Western-style alphabet, in that every letter represents a consonant, and vowels, if they're indicated at all, require diacritics.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to uncertainties in how to pronounce words. Why did G-d use an abjad rather than an alphabet in which to give us the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>An academic reason would be that indeed Hebrew (and other related languages) don't need vowels for disambiguation as much as, say, English. Most Hebrew words are built out of triliteral consonantal roots, so that words with the same consonants are (usually) related, differing only in how they're inflected for different parts of speech, number, tense and so forth. Contrast with English, where the vowels play a much more important part in the etymology of words, and taking them out indeed causes a great deal of ambiguity (which is why \"disemvoweling\" is effective for trollish comments).</p>\n\n<p>Also, classical Hebrew has a CV(C) syllable structure, meaning that a word can't begin with a vowel sound. (Most Jews don't pronounce the letter א, but properly speaking, it is supposed to be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop\">glottal stop</a>.) By contrast, an English syllable can begin with anywhere from zero to three consonants, so there's much greater potential for confusion.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A more classical Jewish approach, as YDK pointed out, is that this very ambiguity allows us to derive multiple layers of meaning from the written text. In the case of G-d's name mentioned in the original (linked and closed) question, it can in fact be written with many different sets of vowel signs, each of which symbolizes some particular way in which He relates to us and we to Him. In other cases, details of Jewish law or thought are arrived at by contrasting the way in which a word is actually vocalized (called in the Talmud <em>mikra</em>) with other possible ways that the same series of consonants could be pronounced (called <em>masores</em>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachye on \"lo sechanem\" (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30841&st=&pgnum=31\">Vaeschanan, 7:2</a>) gives multiple ways of reading the prohibition based on fiddling with the vowels.  He gives this flexibility for multiple versions as the reason for the Torah not including vowels.  See R. Bachye also <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30839&st=&pgnum=43\">Behaalos'cha 11:15</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Or are the scriptures imported from very different cultures so that there is no identifiable mainline, where Judaism originates?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>It is important to bear in mind that a lot of the techniques that science (specifically, archeology) uses to derive information about ancient cultures and religions can't be validly applied to Judaism. Consider, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One source of such information is the arts, such as statuary, vase paintings, and the like. The Torah outlaws the making or possession of images \"of anything in the heavens above, on the earth below, or in the waters below the earth\" (Ex. 20:4), \"the form of a male or female... of any animal on the earth... of any winged bird... of anything that crawls on the earth... of any fish in the waters below the earth\" (Deut. 4:16-18). Furthermore, unlike other deities, G-d is not representable in any form. So that's out; any such image would in fact be prima facie evidence of failure to observe Jewish law properly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another is the remains of cultic centers, be they private shrines in people's houses, or major ones funded by the state. In Jewish law, except for brief periods, only one central place of sacrificial worship was permitted (it moved around until it was established on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, not exactly an area conducive to archeological study). Again, then, any altar or whatnot that you'd find elsewhere would almost certainly have been set up in violation of the law.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then there is written material, such as monumental inscriptions by various kings in which they mention the gods they worshipped, or copies (on clay tablets or the like) of famous myths that formed part of the basis of the local religion. We Jews have only one written Law, and the rules for writing it are fairly strict - it is to be written with ink on parchment (as indeed is done to this day), a material which generally doesn't survive without efforts at preservation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So the available scientific data about early Judaism is pretty fragmentary; your average secular writer's description of it is likely to be about 1% fact and 99% conjecture - much of that based on Comparative Religion 101 (and, as above, much of that can't correctly be applied from the outset).</p>\n\n<p>With that said, to the best of my knowledge the earliest known extant part of the Bible is a small silver scroll containing the Priestly Blessing (Num. 6:24-26), found in an archeological dig near Jerusalem and dated to the late First Temple period (about 600 BCE). More complete texts, differing from ours only in detail, are the Dead Sea Scrolls, usually dated to around the 1st century BCE or the 1st century CE.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is also worth noting, though, that the Samaritans have an independent tradition of the Torah (and of Judaism, although that's not the term they use since they don't trace their descent to the tribe of Judah). Their text of the Five Books of Moses differs from ours but is still recognizably the same, and they also have a book of Joshua whose contents are considerably different - but no others. Now, the Samaritans and the mainstream Jews have been enemies at least since the 5th century BCE, meaning that there is no time since then when one could have borrowed from the other; that, then, is a latest possible date (terminus ad quem) for the writing of the Torah. In a couple of his books, R. Avigdor Miller goes further and points out the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Samaritans themselves claim to be descended from the original Israelite inhabitants of northern Israel. The biblical account (II Kings 17:24ff) states that they are descended from foreigners imported into the land by Sennacherib after he had destroyed the northern Israelite state and exiled its people, but who learned the Torah from Israelite priests whom Sennacherib brought back at their request. Either way, then, the Samaritan scriptures must derive from earlier Israelite originals.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Israelite and Judean kingdoms were at loggerheads, politically and religiously, almost continuously. In particular, each side considered the other's form of divine worship to be illegitimate. There is therefore no real possibility of either one having borrowed religious concepts from each other; if they both had Torahs that are recognizably the same, they must go back to a common source predating their split - which brings us back to the 9th or 10th century BCE.</p></li>\n<li><p>Aside from the Pentateuch and Joshua, there are a couple of other biblical books (including Judges, Samuel and Ruth) that describe events before the split of the two kingdoms. But we see that the Samaritans don't have any version of those, which would imply that neither did the northern Israelite kingdom. The reason, R. Miller writes, can only be that those had been written fairly recently, and the Israelite kingdom could feel free to discard them (the more so since many of them are associated with the Davidic dynasty against which they had revolted); but evidently the first six books of the Bible were so old and venerated by that time that they were kept. Which fits well with our tradition, that these books were first written down in the 13th century BCE.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Cyrus the Great, reigning 559 BC–530 BC, conquered Babylon in 538 BC and freed the Jews slightly thereafter.

Does not having this line make the seller an accomplice to the one who transgresses on Shabbos?</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, though, how did this practice originate? Last time I bought a chicken at my local butcher, I don't recall seeing a sign \"please do not cook on Shabbos\". Actually, I don't remember seeing this <em>anywhere</em> else. So why music?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Maybe because early Jewish recordings were mostly cantorial style, and there was a serious concern that people would play recordings of Shabbos and Yom Tov liturgy on those days.</p>\n\n<p>Also, perhaps it is psychologically more disturbing to think that someone will play a recording that makes <strong>your voice</strong> speak on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The March 20, 2013 issue of Mishpacha magazine contains the following anecdote in an interview of the singer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Fried\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avrohom Fried</a>, regarding the events preceding the production of his first album, \"No Jew Will be Left Behind,\" in 1981:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[He] kept his plan quiet. But he wrote a letter to the [Lubavitcher] Rebbe explaining his idea, and the Rebbe wrote back wishing him <em>hatzlachah</em> -- and instructing him to print the words \"Please do not play this recording on Shabbos and Jewish holidays\" on the album.</p>\n<p>\"It seemed like a strange suggestion,\" muses the singer. \"After all, how many people were there who were into chassidic music but not into Shabbos?\"</p>\n<p>It was a suggestion that could only have been made by someone who belived that no Jew will be left behind -- that even one transgression by one Yid is too much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the practice seems to have begun even earlier, as the 1973 debut album of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_ben_David\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mordechai Ben David</a> contains the <a href=\"http://media.dartmouth.edu/%7Edjsa/Streaming/Sings_Original_Chassidic_Nigunim/Back.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">admonition</a>, \"Please do not play this record on the Sabbath.\" Similarly, his 1974 album Hineni <a href=\"http://media.dartmouth.edu/%7Edjsa/Streaming/Hineni/Back.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">states</a>, \"Please do not play this record on the Sabbath or Holidays.\" It's quite possible that this, too, originated with the Lubavitcher Rebbe, as MBD did have some connection with the Rebbe (if my impressions are correct). But this is just conjecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I checked the jackets of the early albums of Cantor David Werdyger (MBD's father), and discovered that his 1959 record \"T'filo L'Dovid\" did not contain the phrase in question, but it <em>did</em> appear in his 1962 record \"Songs of the Gerrer Chasidim.\" So the practice definitely predates Avrohom Fried by at least 19 years.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When a person buys a kosher chicken from a butcher, it is presumed that he will not cook it on Shabbos.  I mean, he knows about keeping kosher so he probably knows about Shabbos, too.</p>\n\n<p>CDs, however, are purchased by a wide range of Jews.  Unfortunately, not every Jew knows that playing CDs on Shabbos or Yom Tov is not permissible in the Jewish religion.  </p>\n\n<p>It's just a little insurance, baby.  The Shomer-Shabbos musician will not be happy that another Jew is violating Shabbos to hear his/her music!</p>\n\n<p>By the way, don't read this answer on Shabbos or Yom Tov!</p>\n\n\n",

There are different levels of gzeiros and there's a possibility of changing them after the fact. The main view there says that the gzeira for the Tzibbur is never sealed, but things do become sealed for the individual on Yom Kippur. This fits with the general emphasis in the Torah on a higher level of hashgacha for the tzibbur than for the individual (e.g. the second parsha of Sh'ma). Sincere teshuva is always accepted so that one can always change his ways and be spiritually cleansed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the course of events in this world can always change for a person at any time. However, one never knows what has been \"decreed\", so I don't think this view would hold one should give up just because there's a sword at one's throat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I like to answer questions by undermining the assumptions, and I am going to try to do that here as well.</p>\n\n<p>חתימה can mean either 'sealed' or 'signed', though they are almost certainly etymologically related. For an example of sealed, see <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0532.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">parashat Haazinu</a>, הֲלֹא-הוּא, כָּמֻס עִמָּדִי;  {ר}  חָתוּם, בְּאוֹצְרֹתָי, 'Is not this laid up in store with Me, sealed up in My treasuries?'</p>\n\n<p>But a חתימה is a signature at the bottom of a document. One could argue of a get that עדי חתימה כרתי, that the witnesses to the signature are what is important. Sometimes, it is unclear which sense is being used. The חתימה of a long blessing is the end, either because it is the sealing up of it, or because it is the sign-off.</p>\n\n<p>See Jastrow <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38236&st=&pgnum=528\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and the next page.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it <strong>is</strong> a similar idea. Hashem is writing the gzar din, but it is not completed and signed until Yom Kippur. At that point, the gzar din goes into effect.</p>\n\n<p>What about teshuva? It seems to me -- though I am not citing any sources for this -- that there is a period of judgement, where all sorts of factors about the person are evaluated, and his situation for the coming year is determined. This can shift so long as the judgement has not been signed. After that, there is a gzar din, a decree of judgement. Maybe it is harder to overcome, and one needs significantly more teshuva, for that sin, to overcome a decree. Whereas in the process of judgement, other factors (and balances) might have come into play such that the negative judgement might not have even come to be.</p>\n\n\n",

Most medicines are a random series of active ingredients with little meaning to the non medical professional - but what about \"chocolate flavored\" etc tablets or liquids?</p>\n\n<p>I know that here in Australia there exists a kosher book for regular food, but not one for medicine. On the other hand i recall hearing that Strepsil lozenges (sore throat) that used to be kosher are not any more. </p>\n\n<p>So, points of interest are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>flavouring</li>\n<li>degree of importance (heart medicine / sleep pills / stimulants / sore throat lozenges)</li>\n<li>age?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>First of all, as many major agencies point out with regards to Passover, <strong>if it's a heart medication, antidepressant, or any other medication without which there would be serious risk to one's life; take it first and ask kosher questions later</strong>. If you can get one with better ingredients kosher-wise that's great, but first and foremost make sure you're taking it.</p>\n\n<p>There are different opinions and practices with regards to pills that are swallowed; if I recall correctly a major opinion is that if someone is \"seriously but not life-threateningly sick\", then the rabbinic prohibition against swallowing pills with non-kosher ingredients would be waived. Hence someone with bad arthritis could, for instance, take chondroitin pills even if the only available ones were made from non-kosher fish.</p>\n\n<p>For someone who is just \"feeling a bit something\" (e.g. a small headache), there may be less room.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there are dispensations for medicines that may not apply to vitamins that a healthy person takes for optimum health. Hence many a great rabbi requires a kosher certification on multivitamins (of which there are now several brands, fortunately, and many are easy to find at vitamin or health-food type stores).</p>\n\n<p>There is another rule that with small children, increment their level of sickness by one. So a toddler with \"just a headache\" should be given the dispensations of a healthy adult who is now seriously knocked out; and a toddler who is \"seriously sick\" could allow for things otherwise reserved for \"serious risk to life.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Chewables and syrups are more of an issue, as you're ingesting them like food. A common concern is glycerin in many syrups; glycerin could be from animal or plant sources. If you can't find a kosher-certified version, the Star-K has recommended diluting the syrup with several parts water, so that any non-kosher glycerin is less than 1/61 by volume of the total mix. (While we frown upon taking something you know is non-kosher and diluting it, here it's reasonably likely this glycerin was plant-derived.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shalom Rav / Sim Shalom - by Mincha according to Nusach Ashkenaz\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Nusach Ashkenaz says Shalom Rav at Mincha most days. However, when there is Birchas Kohanim (such as a fast day), they say Sim Shalom. Is there a connection between Birchas Kohanim and Sim Shalom? If there is a connection, what is it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Rambam <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=516\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hil. Tefillah 1:2</a>, Tefillah ends with hoda'ah, gratitude, not a request to grant peace.  Bakashos, requests, are in the middle of the tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>My Rav gave a shiur based on the above, plus the idea of bircas kohanim following avodah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9754&st=&pgnum=104\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shmini 9:22</a>) (and other sources), that sim shalom is a distinct part of tefillah specially instituted as a format for saying bircas kohanim.  In other words, sim shalom exists only to say bircas kohanim.  </p>\n\n<p>However, it was instituted as an integral part of shemona esre and is said even in the silent tefilla and even when there are no kohanim or where the minhag is not to say bircas hakohanim.  I don't know how the nusach change was established.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I recently got a ksav yad of the shiur from my rav.  I can't post the entire shiur, but the upshot is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The bracha of shalom rav is a public bracha (tzorchei rabim) as the language testifies.  Its proper place is before modim (which completes the tefilah) as part of the final 3 brachos, as it is tzorchei rabim.</li>\n<li>Bircas kohanim is an independent institution that the sages  structured following the tefilah (but as part of the tefilah) in the same way it followed avodah in the mikdash.</li>\n<li>Bircas kohanim should be followed with a bracha for the individual (tzorchei yachid) asking that the brachos should be accepted on us.  This must be done specifically after bircas kohanim.</li>\n<li>The bracha of shalom and the bracha for acceptance are combined  into sim shalom when bircas kohanim should be said.  This is why sim shalom is in a language of  tzochei yachid (borcheinu- like choneinu, refaeinu).  Because part of the dual nature of the bracha is for bircas kohanim, the bracha must be said after bircas kohanim, not before modim.</li>\n<li>To avoid confusion, the sages instituted shalom rav after modim as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Textual variants other than Nusach Ashkenaz simply have the text <em>sim shalom</em>. </p>\n\n<p>In Nusach Ashkenaz, it appears that the lengthy <em>sim shalom</em> was intended for prayers at which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestly_Blessing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Birkat Kohanim</a> (which concludes with \"may G-d grant you peace\") could be said; and an abridged version, <em>shalom rav</em>, at prayers where it couldn't. (At night, as well as afternoons as often people would have had a strong drink by then, except on fast days. This is also why many, many synagogues do Birkat Kohanim on Simchat Torah early on in the prayers, before the liquor starts flowing.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Nusach Ashkenaz does connect Sim Shalom with Birkas Cohanim, as opposed to Nusach Sefard where Shalom Rav is said at Maariv due (I think) to the less obligatory nature of the prayer.  The Arizal rules that Sim Shalom is to be said at all three prayers as all three are obligatory, and Sefardim and many Chasidim follow his ruling. I know the Artscroll siddurs give over reasons for all of this, but I don't have access to those right now. </p>\n\n\n",

(Compare to חולין.) It can be, therefore, used as a sort of interjection, that it should be foreign, profane, to take such an action. In response to Yosef's steward's accusation that they stole the goblet, Yosef's brothers say:\nז  וַיֹּאמְרוּ אֵלָיו--לָמָּה יְדַבֵּר אֲדֹנִי, כַּדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה; <strong>חָלִילָה</strong>, לַעֲבָדֶיךָ, מֵעֲשׂוֹת, כַּדָּבָר הַזֶּה.\nwhich <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0144.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mechon-mamre</a> renders as:\nAnd they said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? <strong>Far be it</strong> from thy servants that they should do such a thing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>חס</strong> is both a Hebrew and Aramaic word which means mercy, to spare something. For instance, in the Tosefta, שחס המקום עליו. Or in Yerushalmi, חס הוא אדם על כבוד אלמנתו. Jastrow lists it as both Hebrew and Chaldean (=Aramaic). An example from Tanach is in Yirmeyahu 13:14:\nפסוק י\"ד: וְנִפַּצְתִּים אִישׁ אֶל-אָחִיו וְהָאָבוֹת וְהַבָּנִים, יַחְדָּו--נְאֻם-ה; לֹא-אֶחְמוֹל וְלֹא-<strong>אָחוּס</strong> וְלֹא אֲרַחֵם, מֵהַשְׁחִיתָם.\n\"I will not spare and I will not have mercy.\"</p>\n\n<p>When someone wants to say that something terrible should not happen, they may search for words that express different aspects of the idea, and form the idiom out of this. (A sort of hendiadys, perhaps, in which there is a conjunction, but both words function to establish the one idea.) Chas veShalom = mercy and peace, which is what there should be, for this should not happen. Or Chalila vaChas, far be it, and He should spare.</p>\n\n<p>They are then, not, etymologically, the same word.</p>\n\n<p>As Dave pointed out in the comment section to the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37938&pgnum=48\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other answer</a>, Rabbi Eliyahu Bachur, in <em>Tishby</em>, writes as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LWdOZ.png\" alt=\"Tishby entry on chas\"></p>\n\n<p>Thus, every Biblical instance of חלילה is translated in Targum as חס. That does not <strong>necessarily</strong> make them the same word, with a simple reduplication in the phrase. It is just that חלילה does not occur as an Aramaic word, and so Onkelos chose the closest idiomatic expression. Putting them together might be a hendiadys in the same way we observe for chas veshalom. On the other hand, maybe it is a reduplication. That this translation occurs consistently might have made them identical in speakers' minds. I lean towards the former, but can grant the latter possibility.</p>\n\n<p>See also Jastrow's discussion <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38236&st=&pgnum=501\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Hz9a.png\" alt=\"Jastrow entry on chas\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<h1>TLDR:</h1>\n<p>More concise answer: It is a pleading imperative to heaven: <strong>\"SPARE US, AND KEEP US WHOLE!\"</strong>.</p>\n<p><sup><em>literally: sparing and well-being/wholness [for the speaker] -</em></sup></p>\n<h1>Longer answer:</h1>\n<p>The phrase is two nouns joined by the conjunction vav. As it is an exclamatory, pleading phrase. The subject (Heaven/God)is implied, and the object (the speaker pleading/recipient) is/are implied. Each noun is a requested state of things or result.</p>\n<p>Looking at the etymology of the root (shoresh) of each noun is helpful.</p>\n<h2>The lemmas of each word</h2>\n<h3>חוס (חס)</h3>\n<p>literally to <strong>spare</strong>, figuratively to <strong>pity</strong>. To demonstrate the range of the lemma, consider that it can even figuratively be translated to <em>be overly-concerned about.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעֵ֣ינְכֶ֔ם אַל־תָּחֹ֖ס עַל־כְּלֵיכֶ֑ם כִּי־ט֛וּב כָּל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם לָכֶ֥ם הֽוּא׃</p>\n<p>And never mind <em>(i.e. do not fret over/spare your belongings;\nleave them off)</em> your belongings, for the best of all the\nland of Egypt shall be yours.’”</p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 45.20 JPS</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>(שלום)שׁלם</h3>\nThis lemma literally means to be completed/complete or whole. Figuratively it means to be kept intact, untouched, nothing taken or missing, thus safe, or in good condition. The english hendiadys and idiom \"safe and sound\" does well to point to the idea behind this root.\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר לָהֶ֖ם הֲשָׁל֣וֹם ל֑וֹ וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ שָׁל֔וֹם וְהִנֵּה֙ רָחֵ֣ל בִּתּ֔וֹ בָּאָ֖ה עִם־הַצֹּֽאן׃</p>\n<p>He continued, “Is he well?” <sup><em>(literally: the wholeness/wellness is to/for him?)</em></sup> They answered, “Yes, he is <sup><em>(literally: they said, \"wholeness/wellness\")</em></sup>; and there is his daughter Rachel, coming with the flock.”</p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 29.6 JPS</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם עִ֣יר שְׁכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן בְּבֹא֖וֹ מִפַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם וַיִּ֖חַן אֶת־פְּנֵ֥י הָעִֽיר׃</p>\n<p>Jacob arrived safe <sup><em>(literally: whole/nothing-missing/intact</em></sup> in the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan—having come thus from Paddan-aram—and he encamped before the city.</p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 33.18 JPS</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can I use a Parabolic Mirror or Fresnel Lens to cook on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shabbat 39a discusses cooking on Shabbat using the sun.  It is permitted to roll an egg on a hot roof to cook it since this is not a typical way to cook, but you can't burry it in sun-heated-sand because you need to dig a hole to put it in the sand. Also, a handkerchief heated by the sun is ok because you don't need to dig to put the egg in. Rav Grossman adds in his Daf Yomi shiur that there was a machloket over cooking in microwaves on shabbat, they don't get hot, so it should be allowed, however since it is normal to cook using them it's prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>So, can I use a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xOBcADlm-o\" rel=\"noreferrer\">parabolic dish</a> to harness the sun's direct heat to cook on Shabbat? </p>\n\n<p>How about a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMcGzUY6qa8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fresnel</a> Lens? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As I understand it, the Talmud said there was no prohibition at all from cooking with direct sunlight; cooking on a solar-heated brick was prohibited because it looked like you were using an oven-heated brick.</p>\n\n<p>With various lenses and reflectors, presumably you put the food in and then apply the lens; the cooking is with direct sunlight (albeit focused better), not a preheated surface. So I don't think it would fall under the rabbinic prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>The more interesting question is that it may still be Biblically prohibited. As I heard in an mp3 from Rabbi Hershel Schachter, the novel reading of both Rabbis Moshe Feinstein and Joseph Soloveichik was that cooking by direct sunlight was only permissible because that wasn't a \"normal\" way of cooking at the time. (Rabbi Feinstein therefore felt that microwaving food would be a Torah prohibition; although it's been observed that when he wrote that a few decades ago, people thought that the microwave would completely replace the conventional oven; today microwave ovens are primarily handy for reheating, but don't do as much \"real cooking\" as their conventional counterparts.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if concentrated-solar cooking is <em>normal</em>, it would be Biblically prohibited. If <em>abnormal</em>, it would be allowed. How to define <em>normal</em> ... beats me (though my first inclination is that if it was <em>normal</em>, it wouldn't be on YouTube.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As I recall (and, unfortunately, I have no source handy for this, other than the Gemara cited in the question and the RaMBa\"M below) the problem isn't merely the digging, but it is also an issue if the surface contributes to the cooking.  If you were to, for example, use the hot hood of a car on a hot, sunny summer day to fry an egg, this might be a problem.  If, however, you successfully placed the food item on a surface that did not absorb and radiate the heat back into the food and contribute to the cooking process, then it would be permissible.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3109.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">RaMBa\"M seems to Pasken in Hilchoth Shabbath, 9:3-4</a> that it is Asur MiDeRabbanan to cook with alternate sources.  Or am I reading that incorrectly (is my example of a car hood only MiDeRabbanan, but direct sunlight Mutar LeGamrei??)?</p>\n\n\n",

We build the sukkah every year and have friends over for an evening meal, preferably on Shabbes - if someone else in our group of friends isn't doing those. It's a wonderful, community-building holiday. </p>\n\n<p>I've heard that one can only commence sukkah construction after Yom Kippur. I've been doing it this way for years. I often inventory the wood and and schach ahead of time, but I always hold off on construction. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, when riding around town during the days of awe, I've seen people start building before the end of Yom Kippur. Sometimes even synagogues will jump the gun a bit. </p>\n\n<p>From a legal standpoint, <strong>is there any truth to the assertion that one should build the sukkah only during these four days?</strong> If there are dissenting opinions in law, what are they? </p>\n\n<p>(I would personally prefer answers that are in English, or at least sources I can track down and find translations of.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The walls of the sukkah can be constructed anytime you want; you can even leave them up all year, if you're so inclined. (There are even people who have retractable roofs on their houses, so that their sukkah <em>is</em> their dining room or bedrooms or whatever.)</p>\n\n<p>The sechach (plant material used for the roof of the sukkah) is a different story. You can put it up anytime within 30 days before the holiday without a problem. Any earlier than that (or if you leave the sechach on from one Sukkos to the next), you should - although you're not absolutely required to - put new sechach somewhere on the sukkah. The minimum for this is either a square of 4x4 inches, or an extra bit of sechach along the full length of one wall.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&pgnum=198\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 636:1 and Mishnah Berurah there</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>According to Halacha (Orthodox Jewish Law) you may build the Sukkah from 30 days prior to the Yom Tov.

Perhaps the fact that all Jews suffered for his theft indicates that it is a communal requirement to catch & punish thieves, not just Joshua's or the Elders'.

Furthermore, if it says in the Torah that this person must die, (e.g A desecrator of the sabbath must be put to death as it says in Shemos 21,14: ושמרתם את השבת כי קדש הוא לכם מחלליה מות יומת) then a person who escapes would be ignoring a commandment written in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A sin is not a binary condition.

There is a halacha that if you are uncomfortable in the sukkah you can leave. When it rains most people don't eat in the sukkah but Lubavitch especially the Rebbe was seen many a pouring rain drenched in the sukkah. How then could we not sleep in it? Well it was bitterly cold in Russia. That is not the answer either. The answer is as follows. </p>\n\n<p>The Sukkah al pi kabbalah represents the Makif D'Binah, loosely translated as a transcendent encompassing level of Understanding of Hashem. If you have any perception of this, it is a quite overwhelming level of G-dliness in the Sukkah. It is possible to eat and learn Torah in the Sukkah, but sleep? Impossible. The Chabad Rebbeim literally could not sleep there. [<a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/8862908#8862908\">Some say</a> that the Rebbe did not sleep the entire festival of Sukkos, and was therefore able to fulfill both the Halacha and Kabbalah of Sleeping in the Sukkah, or <a href=\"http://theantitzemach.blogspot.com.au/2010/04/blog-post_11.html?showComment=1271039204098#c5200212223189482794\" rel=\"nofollow\">at least</a> did not <em>go</em> to sleep, but rather would just learn until he <em>fell</em> asleep]. What about us? We don't perceive the Makif D'Binah and we wouldn't make it 7 days without sleeping. The answer is that we have such a level of Hiskashrus to our Rebbe that we are pained that he is pained as well as pained that we can't perceive this level of G-dliness. .</p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, I left Lubavitch some years ago and slept in the Sukkah and always was disturbed by something, ie: a dog barking all night, air mattress going flat, and finally the Sukkos before I made my way back to Lubavitch roots I was viciously bitten by insects to the point that I had at least 50 bites on my body. </p>\n\n<p>That was my Makif D'Binah. </p>\n\n<p>The sources for all of this is found in the Sicha quoted above. If you agree or not, this issue was analyzed by the Rebbe with a microscope and if you actually learn the Sicha it is hard to say he is wrong in what he says regardless if you choose to sleep in the sukkah or not.     </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Rebbe actually addressed this question in a letter dated 7 Cheshvan, 5715 [1954]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Re Sleeping in the Succah In order to safeguard and inspire a greater\n  feeling toward the Succah, sleeping in it is not practiced by us. The\n  basis for this is two-fold: First, we have a rule that Hamitztaer\n  putter min HaSuccah (suffering exempts one from dwelling in the\n  Succah). Secondly, during sleep a person is not in control of himself,\n  and, furthermore, the very act of undressing and dressing, etc.\n  inevitably creates a common-place attitude towards the place which\n  serves as a bedroom. Such a depreciation of attitude toward the Succah\n  (by sleeping in it, as explained above), from what his attitude should\n  properly be towards the Mitzvoth of G-d whereby He has sanctified all\n  Jews, would be deeply felt by the Chabad Chassid by virtue of his\n  Chassidic teachings and upbringing, and would cause him profound\n  spiritual suffering. The combination of these two considerations,\n  therefore, led to the custom not to sleep in the Succah. However, if a\n  Jew feels absolutely certain that his sleeping in the Succah will not\n  in the slightest affect his attitude toward the sanctity of the\n  Succah, and is consequently free from any mental pain that might be\n  caused thereby, he is duty-bound to sleep in it, in accordance with\n  the fullest meaning of Taishvu K'ain taduru, to make his Succah his\n  dwelling place to the utmost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Excerpt of letter taken from <a href=\"http://www.lchaimweekly.org/lchaim/5762/688.htm#caption5\" rel=\"nofollow\">L'chaim # 688</a> )</p>\n\n<p>BTW, @mochin rehavim wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I do not have a source for this, but I have heard that Belz's also\n  doesnt sleep in the sukkah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rebbe mentioned this 10 Sivan 5750 – During distribution of dollars for Tzedoka- (the whole conversation can be found in <a href=\"http://www.otzar770.com/library/main_book.asp?nBookId=41&cPartLetter=B&nPageNumber=325\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toras Menachem 5750 Vol 4, P. 325</a>) - where R' Zvi Kahana asked the Rebbe this very question.</p>\n\n<p>PS: To anyone that knows about / read / watched the above 'dollars' encounter and was wondering what was the Rebbe's 'nekudah', well, I saw a <a href=\"http://theantitzemach.blogspot.com.au/2007/07/one-sunday-in-sivan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post about this</a> and one commenter by the name of <strong>guravitzer</strong> summed it up very well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chasidim and Misnagdim disagreed over many things. In the first 2\n  generations or more, they believed each other to be minim and\n  apikorsim - Misnagdim for not having Yiras Shomayim, Chasidim for not\n  following Shulchan Aruch. In the eyes of Lubavitch, that ended in the\n  time of the Tzemach Tzedek, where as we put it Chasidim discovered\n  that Misnagdim are yere shomayim as well, and Misnagdim discovered\n  that Chasidim follow Shulchan Aruch. They ceased to consider each\n  other a threat, or kofrim, and focused on the Maskilim and the various\n  governments oppressing them. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY AGREED WITH EACH\n  OTHER IN MATTER OF HALACHAH OR HASHKAFAH. But the fact that they would\n  work together means they considered each other to be ehrliche Yidden,\n  with reasonable heterim for their behaviors. There was no peace with\n  the Maskilim or the Tzionim for these leaders, as they were truly\n  kofrim.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus: The Volozhiners still disagreed with the Rebbeim on all the\n  issued that exist between Chassidim and the other parties. However,\n  they ceased to be opponents. If they felt that not sleeping in the\n  sukkah, or any other issue that the Mirrer RY could have brought up,\n  were reason to lump Lubavitch with the Maskilim, or even to not\n  consider them Frume leaders, they would have said so. Jewish debate\n  was vociferous then - have you read the manifestos about Tzionus?</p>\n  \n  <p>Nowadays, this is one of the questions used an excuse to be opponents\n  once more. The Rebbe was not asking for all Misnagdim to become\n  Chasidim and agree with all of our Minhogim. The Rebbe wondered why\n  the opposition was revived, which had died out previously, and pointed\n  out one of the weapons used. If the Volozhiners had wanted to be\n  opponents, that could have pulled this out of their arsenal as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I am a Lubavitcher Chassisd myself that learns in a Lithuanian yeshiva. Before Sukkos one year, during a Halacha class, my <a href=\"//meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/593\" rel=\"nofollow\">rebbe</a> was speaking about this topic of sleeping in the sukkah, and I mentioned that in Chabad they don't sleep in the Sukkah because its too holy. He got really angry at that and said \"Well we follow like the Shulchan Aruch\" and then went on to call that practice a denial and the Rebbe ztk\"l a denier of halacha, heaven forbid, for instituting such a practice. I was really disturbed about that for a while so I decided to do some research and I found this: The Rebbe's position was not because of holiness, but rather because of discomfort: one with discomfort is exempt from sukkah. But then <a href=\"//meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/1428\" rel=\"nofollow\">poskim</a> ask on this: but discomfort is only physical elements like hot and cold? And the Rebbe answered that question by saying that if one has discomfort it doesn't matter why, one is exempt because of \"teishvu k'ein t'duru\" (the obligation is to live in a sukkah as one lives in a home). For example, if one would have a holy article in his bedroom (e.g. an antique holy book) he couldn't bring himself to sleep there. So too by Sukkah. <strong>However</strong>, if one does not sense the holiness and is therefore not discomforted, he has no exemption, which is why I <strong>do</strong> sleep in the sukkah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it a mitzva to escape the death penalty?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone is being led to his death by <em>bes din</em> (a Jewish court), is he supposed to try to escape, since, in general, saving one's own life is paramount? More: normally, we say that if someone is out to kill another, the latter can kill him to defend himself. Does that apply here: is the doomed man allowed, if necessary to save himself, to kill the employees of <em>bes din</em> who are leading him to his death?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>About your second question, defending himself by killing his executioners: Mishneh Lemelech (Hil. Rotze'ach Ushemiras Nefesh 1:15) <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=104099&rid=12277\">implies</a> that no. He says that in cases where extrajudicial killing is permitted (e.g., a goel hadam pursuing a murderer, or a zealot attempting to kill a Jew consorting with a gentile woman), then the intended victim may indeed protect himself by killing the assailant; but not where the killing is a mitzvah, as would be true of a person convicted of a capital crime.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure about escaping, although perhaps we can prove that, at the very least, it's not a mitzvah and may indeed be a sin. In the story of Shimon ben Shatach's son who was convicted based on false testimony (Rashi to Sanhedrin 44b ד\"ה דבעיא, and Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 6:3), we see that he willingly went to his death without making any attempt to flee.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Agreed that a person found guilty should accept their sentence; here's a different source.</p>\n\n<p>There are several different Midrashic explanations to <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=25#C4303\">Deuteronomy 25:11-12</a>, involving a woman trying to save her husband. Several say the phrase <em>to save her husband from <strong>his fellow</em></strong> excludes either saving him from an agent of the courts (carrying out the death penalty), or the wife of a court agent (saving her husband, who was acting lawfully, from an assailant). (In Hebrew -- <em>prat l'shliach beit din</em>, or <em>prat l'eishet shliach beit din</em>.) Depending on how you read that, I think you would also conclude as Alex did.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Regarding the first question, if the convicted should attempt to run, there are two cases - first if the convicted is guilty, and second if the convicted knows himself to be innocent.</p>\n\n<p>The Minchas Elazar in a teshuva (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14912&st=&pgnum=74\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1:18</a>) writes that if the convicted is guilty, then he has a responsibility to allow the judgement to be carried out, as this is his only way to attain atonement. If the convicted is innocent, Minchas Elazar is less sure. He suggests the proof from the son of Shimon Ben Shetach referenced in Alex's answer, however he rejects it as inconclusive, as it may have been that he was well-guarded and unable to run away even had he wished to. He leaves the question unanswered.</p>\n\n<p>In a later teshuva <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14912&pgnum=182\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(1:73)</a>, he responds to several suggested arguments both for and against running away. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Point 1 - He should run away -- The convicted has the ability to overturn the judgement even after it has been decided by bringing new evidence. [M.E. - That only shows that he has the ability to <em>alter</em> the verdict, not to subvert it.]</p></li>\n<li><p>Point 2 - He should not run away -- This one is a bit too technical and complex to summarize. [M.E. - The response is equally difficult to summarize.]</p></li>\n<li><p>Point 3 - He should not run away -- The commandment of לא תסור, to follow the instructions of Beis Din, applies even when you know they are making a mistake, as the Chinuch writes. [M.E. - True, but לא תסור is not one of the commandments for which one must give up his life. Therefore, one would violate the commandment of לא תסור and run away to save himself.]</p></li>\n<li><p>Point 4 - He <em>could</em> run away -- The Shevus Yaakov (2:106) writes that someone who is in a situation in which he has a mitzvah to give up his life על קידוש השם can run away, but it is <em>middas chassidus</em> to not run away. The same would apply here. [M.E. - The Kessef Mishna contradicts this opinion of the Shevus Yaakov. (Minchas Elazar then goes on at some length to analyze the opinion of the Kessef Mishnah)].</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

We were also taught that Jews don't bow to idols. </p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to modern-day synagogue judaism. The room where services are held includes an ark for the torah scrolls, and we pray facing it. The congregation even bows in the direction of the ark. I've asked several rabbis about this informally, and I usually get the answer that we're not bowing to the ark but the ark as a representation of God. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: How is this any different from non-Jews bowing to an idol? If Judaism has God who is everywhere, why do we need to bow towards a physical object that's a stand-in for God? Or is this simply human nature, to need to physically see a <em>thing</em> in front of us? </p>\n\n<p>(Please let me know if I can make this clearer, or if I'm stepping on anyone's toes here. Have tried to phrase this respectfully while maintaining clarity.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>Well, here's what comes to mind.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bowing is not reserved for G-d.  There are many cases in the Bible when prominent Jews bowed to kings such as the prophet Natan bowing to David (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a01.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Melachim 1:1:23</a>) and Yosef’s brothers bowing to Yosef (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0142.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Breishit 42:6</a>). Even Avraham (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Breishit 18:2</a>) bowed to strangers whom he suspected of being idolaters (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi to verse 4</a>).</li>\n<li><p>Bowing in the direction of the Ark (or Aron Kodesh, as I shall call it) is not bowing to the Aron Kodesh at all, but rather bowing in the direction of the Holy of Holies in Yerushalayim (Jerusalem). When there is no Aron Kodesh (like a minyan that is not in a synagogue), we bow in the direction of Yerushalayim. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> (quoting Rambam and Shulchan Aruch) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...the Aron Kodesh should be placed \"in the direction in which people pray in that city,\" i.e. toward Yerushalayim. The Shulkhan Arukh records the same rule, but it also recommends that one turn toward the southeast instead of east to avoid the semblance of worshiping the sun\".</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>The law is (not sure if this is across the board) that if the Aron Kodesh is not on the eastern wall (for whatever reason), one faces Yerushalayim irregardless, and <em>does not</em> face the Aron Kodesh.<br>\nThe <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&st=&pgnum=321\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...One should turn towards Eretz Yisrael if they are in the diaspora, and to Yerushalayim if one is in Eretz Yisrael, and towards the Temple if one is in Yerushalayim. We are located in the west so we face east, and therefore we put the Aron Kodesh on the eastern wall, however, <em>even if the Aron Kodesh is on a different wall,</em> <strong><em>one should still face east</em></strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As regards why we should pray in a specific direction at all if G-d is everywhere, I seem to remember learning that the main thing is that your <strong><em>heart</em></strong> be pointed (focused on) towards the Holy of Holies because <strong><em>that is where G-d's presence was strongest on earth.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Edit: (Thanks to <strike>Tom</strike> Shmuel for the source)\nThe Mishna <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h11.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Berachot 4:5)</a> says that if one is unable to face Yerushalayim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"he should direct his heart toward Yerushalayim.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As regards what you were taught in hebrew school, my guess is it was probably over-simplified - depending on how old you were. When I was young, I was taught similarly, but the truth is one is forbidden to worship idols in any way. Some idols are worshiped, not by bowing, but by other means, i.e. throwing rocks at them (source <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940279/jewish/Negative-Commandment-6.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sacrificing one's children</a> (not Isaac style, they went all the way, (according to some<sup>1</sup>)), sacrificing animals to them, burning incense, as well as other things we won't mention <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940279/jewish/Negative-Commandment-6.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. The point is, <strong>worshiping an idol in any way that we worship Hashem is <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940278/jewish/Negative-Commandment-5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">forbidden</a></strong>, <strong><em>as well as worshiping them in any way in which they (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940279/jewish/Negative-Commandment-6.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">specifically</a>) are worshiped</em></strong>. But it must be an <em>idol</em>, or the intent must be that it is, for it to be forbidden. Bowing out of respect to someone is not worship.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940280/jewish/Negative-Commandment-7.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Some</a> do say that they just passed them through fire.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As HodofHod said, we bow in the direction of Jerusalem, and that is also the wall on which we place the ark.</p>\n\n<p>I was taught that this means that if you're at the sides of the room (with the ark in the center), you <em>don't</em> bow toward the ark; you bow toward east.  In some congregations I see everybody bow toward the ark, forming basically a semi-circle, but I don't know if this is because that's how their rabbis have ruled or if the people on the sides are just imitating the people in the center of the room.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We don't bow to the ark. In fact, for bows such as modim derabanan there is no reason to bow in any specific direction. The bows during shmone esrei happen to be towards the ark because at that time we are facing east but only because of the tefilla not the bows.</p>\n\n\n",

In the Torah, many people experience dreams with messages,  Yaakov, Yosef, Pharoh and his wine-maker and baker, Avimelech, Ballaam. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Talmud</strong> Bruchos 55a-57b has a bunch to say about dreams and how to interpret certain symbols in dreams.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dreams are 1/60th of a prophecy. </li>\n<li>Part of them is nonsense. \"Just as wheat cannot be without straw, so there cannot be a dream without some nonsense\" (55a)</li>\n<li>\"A dream which is not interpreted is like a letter which is not read.\" (55a)</li>\n<li>A good dream can take as long as 22 years to be fulfilled. (55b) </li>\n<li>(and much more)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>on <em>Interpreting Dreams</em>: A dream is not inherently good or bad. \"All dreams follow the mouth\"(55b), if the interpreter interprets the dream as good, it will be good, if they interpret it as bad it's bad. As such, one should always try to interpret a dream as good. Bar Hedya would give positive interpretations only to those who paid him, and unfavorable interpretations to those who didn't. (56a) </p>\n\n<p>Birkat Kohanim has a paragraph to pray for a positive-conversion of a dream you dreamt and you don't remember. (55b)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam</strong>: in the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226502309\">Guide of the Perplexed</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Part of the functions of the imaginative faculty is, as you well\n  know, to retain impressions by the senses, to combine them, and\n  chiefly to form images. The principal and highest function is\n  performed when the senses are at rest and pause in their action, for\n  then it receives, to some extent, divine inspiration in the measure\n  as it is predisposed for this influence. This is the nature of those\n  dreams which prove true, and also of prophecy, the difference\n  being one of quantity, not of quality. Thus our Sages say, that\n  dream is the sixtieth part of prophecy: and no such comparison\n  could be made between two things of different kinds, for we\n  cannot say the perfection of man is so many times the perfection of\n  a horse. In Bereshit Rabba (sect. xvii.) the following saying of our\n  Sages occurs,\" Dream is the nobelet (the unripe fruit) of\n  prophecy.\" This is an excellent comparison, for the unripe fruit\n  (nohelet) is really the fruit to some extent, only it has fallen from\n  the tree before it was fully developed and ripe. In a similar manner\n  the action of the imaginative faculty during sleep is the same as at\n  the time when it receives a prophecy, only in the first case it is not\n  fully developed, and has not yet reached its highest degree. But\n  why need I quote the words of our Sages, when I can refer to the\n  following passage of Scripture :\" If there be among you a prophet,\n  I, the Lord, will make myself known unto him in a vision, in a\n  dream will I speak to him\" (Num. xii. 6). Here the Lord tells us\n  what the real essence of prophecy is, that it is a perfection acquired\n  in a dream or in a vision (the original mareh is a noun derived\n  from the verb raah): the imaginative faculty acquires such an\n  efficiency in its action that it sees the thing as if it came from\n  without, and perceives it as if through the medium of bodily\n  senses. These two modes of prophecy, vision and dream, include\n  all its different degrees. It is a well-known fact that the thing\n  which engages greatly and earnestly man's attention whilst he is\n  awake and in the full possession of his senses forms during his\n  sleep the object of the action of his imaginative faculty.\n  Imagination is then only influenced by the intellect in so far as it is\n  predisposed for such influence. It would be quite useless to\n  illustrate this by a simile, or to explain it fully, as it is clear, and\n  every one knows it. It is like the action of the senses, the existence\n  of which no person with common sense would ever deny.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is a dispute, and different rabbis had different things to say.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Talmud</strong> <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_55.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 55b</a> records an opinion that one's dreams are merely a reflection of what one is thinking during the day. Thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Samuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Jonathan: A man is shown in a dream only what is suggested by his own thoughts, as it says, As for thee, Oh King, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed.37  Or if you like, I can derive it from here: That thou mayest know the thoughts of the heart.38  Raba said: This is proved by the fact that a man is never shown in a dream a date palm of gold, or an elephant going through the eye of a needle.39</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And on the next amud:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Emperor [of Rome]1  said to R. Joshua b. R. Hananyah: You [Jews] profess to be very clever. Tell me what I shall see in my dream. He said to him: You will see the Persians2  making you do forced labour, and despoiling you and making you feed unclean animals with a golden crook. He thought about it all day, and in the night he saw it in his dream.3  King Shapor [I] once said to Samuel: You [Jews] profess to be very clever. Tell me what I shall see in my dream. He said to him: You will see the Romans coming and taking you captive and making you grind date-stones in a golden mill. He thought about it the whole day and in the night saw it in a dream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Such dreams would not seem to be prophetic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abarbanel</strong> <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2010/12/dreams-caused-by-four-humours.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">discusses</a> how some dreams are purely the result of the imaginative faculties, modified by the body's physical state, based on the four humors. Thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>for a person, many times, dreams dreams which have no meaningful substance, and they are the product of the imaginative faculties as it changes because of the temperment. For when the red humor {=blood} prevails, he will dream as if he were cast into a powerful fire. And when the white humor {=phlegm} prevails, he will dream that he has fallen into mighty waters. And the like to this, such that the doctors at times take these dreams as signs as to the nature of the illness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, Abarbanel held that certain dreams were prophetic in nature. And of course, there are other views encoded in the Talmud, in close proximity, as reflected in other answers on this page. </p>\n\n<p>But I think the most comprehensive answer would be that it is a <em>machlokes</em>; that there were rationalists and non-rationalists even during the time of the Amoraim; that in the time of the Talmud, dream interpretation was regarded as a science, and that this might change as our understanding of science changes.</p>\n\n<p>So, to address the question as posed,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are they in any way binding, or are they assumed to be just products of an overactive imagination?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think the answer is \"yes\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The other answers were very good, but if you want a lot of information, I recommend the book\n<a href=\"http://www.seforimcenter.com/product.asp?P_ID=2922&strPageHistory=search&strKeywords=mishnat&numPageStartPosition=11&strSearchCriteria=all&PT_ID=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnat HaChalomot </a> by Rabbi Boaz Shalom.\nRab Yehuda Fetaya (ZSWQ\"L) (60-70 years ago) wrote that dreams don't mean anything any more, only under very specific circumstances. The Sefer Hassidim (700 years ago) also write this. I heard HaRab Boaz Shalom Shlit\"a say in his speech that even if the dream meant something, there really is nobody in our time who can interpret it. In conclusion, quoting one of the Rabbanim of Lublin, he said that dreams are the inner deepest desires of the heart coming into fruition in a dream. Thus, dreams should not be taken seriously as much as they used in the time of the Gemara. I really recommend this book, it is very insightful with 750 pages and discussions on demons, dreams, ayin hara, and all that stuff.</p>\n\n\n",

As an example, even if you don't normally drink chalav yisrael...</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is:</strong>  Is there a source that applies this law to permissible/forbidden cases?

The Beit Yosef says that the sources are the Rosh, Mordechai, and Tashbetz (but I have not seen them inside).</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef further quotes the Tashbetz as disagreeing with the conclusion, because eating in purity is not forbidden, but if one is strict about non-Jews' bread now, that would be binding for the future (like the Aruch Hashulchan's position).

If that is the case, then the Tur must have merely picked this example (along with eating chullin b'taharah) because of convenience.</p>\n\n<p>The Chayei Adam 143:1 and Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 130:2 write that because God is more merciful than 'necessary' during this time period, we should respond by keeping stringencies which we wouldn't normally consider to be necessary. Thus, this is a good example of something that the Tur doesn't really consider to be in dispute or require a heter, but is still a \"real thing,\" considering that the Sages did prohibit it and haven't revoked it completely. I'm not sure what else would fit into this category</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/838739/Rabbi_Netanel_Wiederblank/Pas_Akum_Part_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Netanel Wiederblank suggested</a>, based on Ramban, that being careful about pas yisrael was a custom of talmidei chachamim, and so we want to act like talmidei chachamim at this time. Rabbi Sobolofsky offered another possibility that because the decree for pas akum was rescinded only because it would be impossible to keep all year long (according to the Yerushalmi Avodah Zarah 2:8), it is not unreasonable to adhere to it for only ten days of the year.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, he writes, because people get withdrawal syndromes when they do not have what to smoke, and the danger is not so great (R' Moshe writes that the amount of people who get sick is a small minority). Therefore, we say that \"Hashem guards the fools\". </p>\n\n<p>However, he says that one should not start smoking, since there is some danger without any benefits, and there is no desire to smoke until one starts.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20027&pgnum=112\">R' Moshe Shternbuch</a> said that it is forbidden because of </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>danger from Cancer and heart problems. </li>\n<li>the Chazon Ish said that smoking hurts memory and comprehension, so smoking would be prohibited because of \"Lo Tishkach\", that one isn't allowed to do something to cause oneself to forget words of Torah.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=882&pgnum=145\">Binyomin Zilber</a> takes a middle approach, and says that while it may be very unhealthy, yet it would not be intrinsically prohibited. He brings a proof from the Mishna Brurah which permits smoking on Yom Tov, yet in his Likkutei Amarim he says that smoking weakens a person, and causes a waste of time and money. In other words, there are things that are wrong to do, yet not officially \"prohibited\".</p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31603&pgnum=99\">Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> writes (in 1943) to the Rosh Yeshiva of Tomchei Tmimim to absolutely forbid smoking to students under 20 wherever they may be for all 24 hours a day. He should also give over a request to students who are above 20 that it is in their benefit (both physical and spiritual) to quit smoking, by slowly lessening their smoking until they will quit completely.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are two opinions as to what was the Lubavitcher Rebbe's opinion. Someone asked the Rebbe why do Rabbonim not forbid smoking. The Lubavitcher Rebbe answered with two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This matter is for doctors to decide, not Rabbonim.</li>\n<li>It is possible that a harmless cigarette will be invented. However, if there will be a ban, that cigarette would also be included and would be needlessly forbidden.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is a debate between <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15021&st=&pgnum=702\">R' Oberlander</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15021&pgnum=804\">R' Zayants</a>\n as to the meaning of the Rebbe's answer. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>R' Oberlander writes that one reason to permit is because of \"Hashem guards the fools\". One of the sources that we can rely on the verse \"Hashem guards the fools\" is a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=12b&format=text\">Gemara</a> in Yevamos(12b) that has an argument between R' Meir who says that a 11-12 year old should prevent pregnancy (because it is dangerous to give birth at that age) and the Chachamim who permit it because \"Hashem guards the fools\". </p>\n\n<p>However, he brings down the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1611&st=&pgnum=299&hilite=\">Tzemach Tzedek</a> who asks if we can say \"Hashem guards the fools\" in cases where a pregnancy is dangerous for a woman. The Tzmeach Tzedek says that one could differentiate between the Gemara's case and a dangerous pregnancy, because in the case of the Gemara, most 11-12 year olds don't get pregnant, so we could rely on \"Hashem guards the fools\" and a \"majority\" to assume that the dangerous situation won't come up and there will be no pregnancy. However, if the danger is more definite, one can't say \"Hashem guards the fools\".</p>\n\n<p>R' Oberlander then goes on to say how smoking is not very dangerous, so we could rely on \"majority\" (majority of people who smoke don't get sick) and \"Hashem guards the fools\" to assume the \"minority\" dangerous situation won't happen and permit smoking.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, R' Zayents explains the Tzemach Tzedek differently. He explains the idea of \"Hashem guards the fools\" is that when it applies Hashem prevents the \"minority\" dangerous case from happening. In other words, by a 11-12 year old, \"Hashem guards the fools\" means that <strong>such a case will not occur</strong> (she won't get pregnant). However, if a dangerous situation would occur, we would have to worry about it in the first place. Since in smoking there is at least this \"minority\" of smokers who get sick, we would have to take them into account and forbid smoking.\nMoreover, R' Zayentz points out that the letter where the Rebbe gave reasons why Rabbis don't forbid smoking does not mention \"Hashem guards the fools\". The Rebbe's letter says that smoking is a medical questions for doctors to address, and as long as it's unhealthy it's automatically forbidden, and when it will become healthy, it will be automatically permitted.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=921&st=&pgnum=20&hilite=\">Igros Moshe</a> permits the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dor_Yeshorim\">Dor Yeshorim</a> test even though there is only a small chance of having children with birth-defects, and says that not taking the test is like closing one's eyes to danger. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>To add to the answer(s) about R' Moshe Feinstein's Pesak, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_David_Tendler\">R' Dr. Moshe D. Tendler</a>, son-in-law of R' Moshe Feinstein, has been an outspoken advocate for banning smoking 'Al Pi Halachah, and he has publicly stated (in fact, I've been present in a large audience where he has stated) that he firmly believes R' Moshe Feinstein's Pesak would have been very different, outlawing it 100% in all cases, had the medical community known then what it knows now about just how deadly it actually is.</p>\n\n<p>One point he emphasized when I heard R' Dr. Tendler speak on the topic is that, at the time that R' Moshe Feinstein wrote his Teshuvah, it was believed by the medical community that those who get sick are a small minority and that the risk is small.  R' Moshe consulted doctors and medical experts in rendering his decision. The consensus among them at the time of his decision was that it wasn't good for you, but it wasn't yet determined to be as severely or as commonly dangerous as we now know it to be.  In other words, the wording of R' Moshe's ShU\"T reflected the understanding of the medical community's overall consensus as conveyed to him by those experts he consulted at the time.  According to R' Dr. Tendler, R' Moshe based the Pesak entirely on that assessment, which, according to him, means that the Pesak would have been a 100% ban with today's awareness in the medical community.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To echo above answer:</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein strongly discouraged it and prohibited new use, but couldn't quite prohibit existing smokers from continuing their awful habit (and as such, allowed one to give a smoker a light if asked), despite protests from his student Dr. Fred Rosner.</p>\n\n<p>Some 15 years later, in light of further medical proof of just how awful smoking is (and the advances in detection and treatment for many types of cancer, but not lung), the RCA's position became to flat-out prohibit it.</p>\n\n\n",

Like, did Ezekiel really visit a valley of bones? Did Isaiah really walk around naked and barefoot for three years? That is a different question. Whether one would like to understand those stories as actual occurences or as metaphorically inspirational visions of the navi, they have no effect on the \"inerrancy\" of the Prophets.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your particular question about Shlomo and his wives and concubines: First of all, it is unlikely that any but a few of his wives actually lived in Jerusalem. Shlomo, like many kings in those days, probably married many foreign women for political purposes, as was probably the case with Pharoah's daughter. Additionally, it is unlikely in regard to most of his wives/concubines, that he ever visited them more than once in his lifetime. More likely that he had wives and concubines living all throughout Israel, besides for the ones that perhaps lived in foreign lands.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: To address the books of Kesuvim, since we are quoting Abarbanel, I should mention that he seems to believe (and I'm sure there are others who would disagree) that the authors of Kesuvim were not completely \"inerrant\", being that he has no problem with <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14367&st=&pgnum=545\">suggesting</a> that Ezra, the assumed author of Divrei Hayamim who used the earlier books of the Neviim as historical sources, indeed erred in his understanding of a verse in Sefer Melachim. [This is a consequence of the belief that the Kesuvim were written without the authority of prophecy (unlike the Neviim), but are nonetheless written with <em>ruach hakodesh</em>, which is divine assistance in the perfect phraseology for the expression of ideas the author wishes to express (so much so that intricate inferences can be made from the specific language the author uses), but not necessarily divine assistance in factual inerrancy.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do I avoid thirst when fasting?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I started fasting on Yom Kippur as an adult, about 10 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>A couple times I had to drink a glass of water either after Kol Nidre or before Shacharit, because I felt completely dehydrated (I did go on with the fast after that)</p>\n\n<p>What steps do you recommend to avoid this situation? Foods to avoid during the previous meal? Specific hydration steps?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Please see \"<a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/fasting/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Segal Guide to Fasting For Yom Kippur (from a Medical Perspective)</a>,\" written by a physician. The very first point he deals with is the thirst issue you raised.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most people think the difficulty about fasting is feeling \"hungry\".  However, avoiding thirst is much more important for how you feel. Not only do you avoid the discomfort of thirst but you are also well hydrated and swallow frequently, so your stomach does not feel as empty.</p>\n<p>One important way to remain well hydrated is to avoid drinks or foods that cause your body to get rid of water. Such foods and drinks include alcohol, tea, caffeinated coffee and chocolate. Another important rule is to avoid consuming much salt. Salt causes a person to feel thirsty despite having a \"normal\" amount of water, because extra water is needed for the extra salt. For this reason you should avoid processed foods containing lots of salt such as pickles, cold cuts, or cheese.  Most tomato sauces,  canned fish and smoked fish have a lot of added salt. Since Kosher meat has a high salt content it may be best to choose a main course such as fresh fish, canned no-salt tuna fish or a de-salted meat such as boiled chicken.</p>\n<p>By avoiding these types of foods and drinks in the several hours before a fast, you can avoid either losing water or needing extra water. Other actions that cause the body to lose water, such as perspiring in warm clothing, should also be avoided during the fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hope you have a successful and meaningful fast this year!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>From a personal perspective, I have found that the easiest fasts I have had, came when Yom Kippur was on a Monday, and Sunday morning I did a 3-4 hour run (training for a fall marathon).</p>\n\n<p>My theory is that knowing how dumb an idea it is to do a 3-4 hour run, mere hours before a 25 hour fast, I try to compensate by drinking the rest of the day, every 10-20 minutes having a mouthful or two of water at time.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually how I try to optimize hydration during long distance races, but doing it before Yom Kippur seems to have helped.</p>\n\n<p>Based on a comment from Monica Cellio I feel I should add that the reasoning behind hydrating in the described fashion is based on the uptake rate of the typical persons gastrointestinal tract is about 800 mL to 1 litre an hour.  So drinking more than that at once means your kidneys will just discard it. </p>\n\n<p>For your stomach to effectively absorb water you want to keep it constantly absorbing, with a small amount of physical pressure.  A couple of mouthfuls at a time keeps the stomach somewhat occupied, and the physical presence helps generate a very small amount of pressure that helps the absorption process. </p>\n\n<p>Thus doing this every 10 minutes or so keeps the pressure up, and maximizes the time your body has to absorb the water.</p>\n\n<p>Of course expect to visit the potty a lot as a consequence of this! </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The key to not getting dehydrated while fasting is to thoroughly hydrate in the days leading up to it.  If you drink a lot of caffeine (or alcohol) especially, gradually back off from that and replace it with water.  I start the day after Rosh Hashana, replacing other drinks with water or fruit juice over the course of the week.  In the last 24 hours before the fast I drink no caffeine at all, and I drink plenty of water -- a couple quarts over the course of the day.  Supplementing this with watery foods (like fruits) is also good.  (I'm focusing here on the drinking aspects; there are other questions on this site about foods to eat or avoid eating.)</p>\n\n<p>You'll still be hungry, and thirsty.  You may well get a caffeine headache.  But if I do this I don't feel parched and desperate to drink something.</p>\n\n<p>If you still feel like you need to drink some water, ask your rabbi if it would be ok to swish some water around in your mouth and then spit it out instead of swallowing.  Depending on your situation he might be able to offer you that leniency, and that might be enough to trick your body so the feeling abates.</p>\n\n<p>This is all assuming that there is no health issue, of course.  If you have something special going on, consult your rabbi <em>and</em> your physician before Yom Kippur to find out what you need to do.</p>\n\n\n",

It is almost always mechanically enhanced.  </p>\n\n<p>New York City in some cases might be an exception, since almost all the water pressure is entirely due to gravity.  The water from the reservoirs in the mountains north of the city, literally goes downhill to the city, and is still benefiting from a gradient as it hits the city.  This is apparently sufficient for even reasonably tall buildings!  10 stories or so before mechanical assistance is needed. In which case it is pumped to a tank on the roof, which then uses gravity again when needed.</p>\n\n<p>So whenever you turn on the tap, flush the toilet, use the water, you deplete the current source, and if it is mechanically assisted, that needs to be replaced.

As it stands, women with no children don't have the reason but are still excused, and men who have child-care duties are still obligated.  (Granted that the rabbis of the talmud were probably not considering this latter case.)  It seems odd to me that a stay-at-home dad is obligated while his teenage daughter is exempt.</p></li>\n<li><p>Women are on a higher spiritual plane and do not need as many mitzvot.

Since Tfillin is a positive commandment which is time-bound (one can't wear them on Shabbos/Yom Tov), so too women aren't obligated in all positive commandments which time-bound.</p>\n\n<p>However, even after this technical answer (women are free from positive time-bound mitzvos) women could still ask: \"Why should I lose out the benefits of Mitzvos? Mitzvos connect me to Hashem?\" This is where the answers that you mentioned come in. Since women are not obligated in these mitzvos, it means that the connection one could accomplish with these mitzvos is accomplished on its own.

What about someone who may have been an oved avoda zarah? Someone who is definitely such?</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking because I've seen <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/steve-jobs-rip\">such discussion online</a> regarding Steve Jobs' death.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not judging the man, as I don't think it's appropriate to do so. (See <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/105438/Op-Ed%3a-Steve-Jobs-&-The-Frum-World.html\">my comments here</a> for more on that.) However, the issue has arisen, and so I'm asking.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Well there are two things going on here:</p>\n<p>According to Talmudic law, upon hearing bad news, one is supposed to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Baruch ata adonoi eloheinu melech ha'olam, dayan ha'emes.</p>\n<p>Blessed are you G-d, our Lord, king of the Universe, the judge of truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now what constitutes \"bad news\"? Certainly a death in the family, but all sorts of other things could be bad news depending on your situation. Learning that your investments went up in smoke, for instance. (There were situations when upon hearing that one's ox died suddenly, the blessing was made. Not out of grief for the loss of a pet, but because that was a serious piece of business capital.)</p>\n<p>I'd thus assume that if someone was stricken by a non-Jew's death sufficiently to call it bad news, s/he should acknowledge G-d's judgment accordingly. There aren't hard-and-fast rules here, it can depend how you feel. I'd assume if a convert stayed close with his/her non-Jewish parent and the parent died suddenly, it would be bad news and thus appropriate to say the blessing.</p>\n<p>So I guess the question really is, how deeply and personally do you feel the sudden news of Steve Jobs' death?  My guess is that for most people it doesn't quite hit the bar, but that's just me. (Of course, how much Apple stock you own could make a big difference here ...)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The other question is that we're accustomed to saying \"baruch dayan emes\", \"bless the true judge\" as a shorthand (without the name of G-d), whenever we share bad news. This is more of a cultural question; my impression is it's usually used either for a notable Jew (\"baruch dayan emes, Rabbi Menashe Klein passed away just before Rosh Hashana\") or for something particularly personal (\"baruch dayan emes\", my neighbor the convert just lost his parents in a car crash). I'd beware its dilution by using it for any death one hears of; not as a matter of law but as a matter of taste.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Without Hashem's name you can for sure say it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Gentile owned and operated Kosher establishment\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any restrictions or limitations for a gentile owning and operating a kosher establishment?  Are there any limitations or restrictions for Jews patronizing such an establishment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In modern times in the first world, if a gentile wants observant Jews to frequent his establishment, he should obtain commercial certification of <em>kashrus</em> (kosher status). The certifying agency will explain all he needs to do to satisfy their requirements, which will vary from agency to agency. And the only restriction on Jews will be to ensure that there is an agency they trust certifying the establishment as kosher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Let's assume here that we're starting with all-kosher ingredients, e.g. plain produce without infestation concerns; ingredients with a kosher symbol on them; kosher meat that came certified, soaked, salted, and ready to use.</p>\n\n<p>If a non-Jew wants to open, say, a grocery store where all products go straight from case to shelf, and only stock products with kosher certification, he's welcome to do so; though customers would be wise to double-check the labels. Similarly, most soda syrups and Slurpee-type bases are already kosher-certified; plenty of non-Jewish-owned convenience stores will gladly show an adult customer the packages of syrup or base that were used, so s/he can check for the certification.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, let's break this question into three parts:</p>\n\n<h2>Supervision requirements</h2>\n\n<p>There are matters of kosher supervision in which a Jew who keeps Shabbat and kosher is trusted more than a non-Jew (or a Jew who doesn't keep those). Kosher meat (including poultry) in particular (considering how easily and cheaply it could be swapped for non-kosher meat) requires a kosher-keeping Jew to keep an eye on it on a quite regular basis. Hence, if you're a non-Jew and would like to open a kosher restaurant that serves meat, you will need a full-time, kosher-keeping Jew (known as a <em>mashgiach</em>, or supervisor) to keep an eye on things. Different communities will have different standards regarding how much other work he can be expected to do as well. If you want to be open on Saturdays, well, good luck finding an observant Jew to work for you those days. Practically speaking, a kosher meat restaurant is closed for Shabbat. (Yes, hotels, catering halls, nursing homes, and other places can and do make special arrangements otherwise.) </p>\n\n<p>If a meat restaurant is owned by a kosher-keeping Jew, as a matter of good safeguards it's generally recommended that someone other than the owner serve as kosher supervisor.</p>\n\n<p>Non-meat items (let's call it \"dairy\" for convenience) aren't subject to the same supervision requirements; as long as there are occasional checks, and it's overwhelmingly against the business' interests to introduce non-kosher ingredients, you're good to go. Hence there are plenty of kosher doughnut shops that are owned by non-Jews; they can be open on Saturdays too. (Whereas if a Jew owns the shop, he should be closing his doors on Saturdays.) </p>\n\n<h2>Cooking acts that must be performed by a Jew</h2>\n\n<p>Recognizing food's role with regards to culture, the Talmud mandated certain Jewish involvement in the preparation of kosher food. For bread and baked goods, a Jew should turn on the oven (or at least throw a wood chip into the fire; some commercial bakeries now have a small glow bar that the Jew turns on, then the bakery turns on the main oven element when needed). Furthermore, if you're cooking any non-baked-good food that is good enough to be served at a state dinner (so not canned sardines, but yes an entree at a nice restaurant), you must have a Jew turn on the flame first for it to be kosher -- and according to some, the Jew must also put the pot on the flame. Hence, if you're not Jewish and want to open a kosher restaurant, beyond all supervision requirements, you'll need a Jew around to turn stuff on in the mornings (and for some, to put pots on the flame all day). Again this isn't a concern for doughnut shops, as (sorry Homer) doughnuts aren't state-dinner-worthy. </p>\n\n<h2>Jews should give their business to other Jews, <em>ceteris paribus</em></h2>\n\n<p>Based on a lecture I heard from Rabbi Breitowitz: <em>All else being equal</em>, Jews are supposed to support other Jews by doing business with them. So if I can buy the identical product from a Jew or a non-Jew for the same price, I should go to the Jew (and even be willing to pay \"a little\" more). Now kosher-supervision agencies will gladly supervise both Jewish-owned and non-Jewish owned restaurants, per the conditions above. So if I'm now debating between eating at Heimowitz's Pizza and O'Sullivan's Pizza, both of which have the same kosher certification, Heimowitz gets a certain preference. <em>However</em>, that's only if they sell an identical product. If I think O'Sullivan's is a lot tastier, I'm not obligated to buy less-tasty pizza (life's too short for less-tasty pizza). Though if there's the danger of Heimowitz going out of business, \"it would be a great mitzva\" to patronize him, but not required. (Though if his pizza's truly awful, maybe the biggest mitzva would be to advise him to try something else ...)</p>\n\n<p>If the restaurant is gentile-owned but employs many Jews ... that gets tricky as well. The subject was actually addressed in a responsum -- <a href=\"http://bdld.info/2014/04/14/tuzemak-that-maketh-glad-the-heart-of-man/\" rel=\"nofollow\">To'afot Re'em OC22</a> about a kosher-for-Passover liquor factory that is owned by a non-Jew but employs many Jews. (Rabbi Taubes felt that giving business to a Jewish-employing company is just as good as giving it to a Jewish-owned company; \"how can you tell whose Jews' money is dearer?\")</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The answer depends on the facts of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a grocery that resells closed products, like drinks, cookies etc I don't recall anything right now that would limit you.</p>\n\n<p>If you are producing/serving the food, like in a restaurant you will need to follow the rules of Kashrut.\nThere are many details, but the question is on top of that what difference does it make if the owner is not Jewish. You may need a Kashrut supervisor, who would have control over the food and perhaps the keys to the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>One upside of a non-Jewish owned establishment, though, is that I believe you wouldn't need to sell chametz before Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

So a sukkah under a balcony, as much of a good-faith effort as it may be (and as much as G-d might appreciate the thought), simply isn't a sukkah - no more so than an Etch-A-Sketch, even one given with the best of intentions, will perform the functions of an iPad.</p>\n\n<p>There might indeed be halachic considerations of which I'm unaware, though, so that alone is a good reason to consult with a reliable authority.</p>\n\n<p>One other factor that might come into play: granted that in your entire neighborhood there are no balconies that can be used for sukkahs (and actually, what about the ones on the top floors of the buildings?), are there any other conceivable possibilities within walking distance? For example, your building might have a courtyard, or perhaps even you could get permission to build one on the roof, or on the sidewalk right near the building, or you could borrow a neighbor's pickup truck and build your sukkah on its bed, etc. (Bear in mind that the footprint of a minimum-sized kosher sukkah isn't all that much; it's about 28\"x28\" even according to the most stringent opinions, or as little as 21\"x21\" according to more lenient ones - basically, the amount of space in which one person can sit with a dinner tray. A refrigerator carton would do the job, as long as it's braced so it won't fall over; indeed, one time my father-in-law did just that.) For that matter, your synagogue (again, if it's within walking distance) probably has a sukkah. These are all things to consider before giving up on such a beautiful mitzvah or doing it in a less-optimal way.</p>\n\n\n",

Shimon mistakenly drops the jar, and it cracks open to reveal 8 small diamonds. Realizing that he was duped, and put at a substantial risk should he have gotten caught, Shimon buys an identical coffee jar and delivers it to his contact in Israel. Conveniently, he decides to not put the diamonds in the new jar.</p>\n\n<p>2 days later, Shimon gets a call from a very irate Reuven. After giving Reuven a serious ear-full of mussar, Shimon decides to return the diamonds to Reuven.</p>\n\n<p>And now the question: Is there any basis for Shimon keeping the diamonds, or is it flat-out stealing? Would it matter if the discovery by Shimon was made before or after the flight?</p>\n\n<p>[if your response will be along the lines that smuggling diamonds is not a serious offense, replace the diamonds <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129902#.TpEnJclCqU8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">with your local drug</a>]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a fine question. And the point is well-taken, regarding the seriousness of the offense of smuggling diamonds. Yet the title is confusing to me. In what way is it an award to keep the smuggled diamonds? It seems like rationalization for an act of questionable behavior to consider this an award.</p>\n\n<p>The analogy with illegal transport of narcotics is helpful in that it clarifies the significance of Shimon's dilemma (to keep the diamonds or return them). At first glance it seems a limited purpose analogy. If it were an illegal narcotic and not diamonds, then Shimon would in fact be committing a crime as well by keeping the contraband. Yet the analogy <strong>does</strong> hold water! Why? Because the diamonds may or may not be legally owned by Reuven. So if Shimon chooses to keep the diamonds, he incurs some (or possibly all) of the risk as if the contraband were narcotics instead of diamonds.</p>\n\n<p>Shimon might be putting his friend Reuven at risk by keeping the diamonds. Would the receiving party of the diamonds take action against Reuven? And since Reuven knows that Shimon has possession of the diamonds, because of the phone call, will this receiving party then demand that Shimon deliver what the receiving party may now consider that party's property?</p>\n\n<p>The matter of whether or not the diamonds were discovered before or after the flight is <strong>very</strong> relevant. See the comment by @Curiouser in the linked question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10575/diamonds-in-the-coffee\">Diamonds in the coffee</a>  . This is the reason: If Shimon made the discovery after the flight, and decides to keep the diamonds, <strong>he is choosing to deliberately disobey the laws of the State of Israel in not one, but two ways.</strong> First, he is breaking laws about declaration of goods when crossing international borders. Secondly, he is keeping money that belongs to the Israeli Treasury, in the form of taxes (tariffs?) that would be owed if such valuable goods were legally transported.</p>\n\n<p>This is probably not the sort of answer that you wanted. I scanned through Deuteronomy and Leviticus for a little while, for guidance by analogy, but to no avail. I am a poor Jewish widow, and do not have the knowledge of Talmud as others here. </p>\n\n<p>I see this as a matter of Reuven behaving very unjustly to someone he considers a friend. Shimon has clearly been treated unethically, put at risk and exploited. He deserves recompense. Should it be the eight diamonds? Probably not, due to the reasons I described. What should it be, and of what amount? Something of sufficient monetary value that will discourage Reuven from acting like this again in the future.</p>\n\n\n",

(There are actually portable sukkahs on the market, which are <em>designed</em> to be taken apart and reassembled during the holiday.) You would only run into problems if you wanted to use the materials for some other purpose; they are considered \"set aside\" for use of the mitzvah until the end of Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I now see that there is a disagreement about this issue. Some maintain that the very act of disassembling the sukkah is tantamount to removing the materials from the use for which they were designated. Furthermore, even those who are lenient admit that it is a disgrace for the mitzvah to take apart the sukkah, unless it is going to be reassembled somewhere else. (It's not clear to me whether this second reason would apply to decorations. The first reason would definitely seem applicable.)</p>\n\n<p>That being said, a sukkah which was <em>initially</em> built during Chol HaMoed (e.g., a portable sukkah) is certainly allowed to be taken apart if there is a festival-related need to do so.

(A source for that line of reasoning would be highly appreciated.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>See this <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/sam/48955041.html\">comprehensive survey</a> at Aish, about plastic surgery in general. It mentions this kohen reason, in the name of Rabbi Menashe Klein, in his Mishneh Halachos, and (IIUC) Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach. But others permit for very different reasons:</p>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1961, <strong>Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits</strong>, considered by many to be the father of the discipline of Jewish medical ethics, 3 addressed the American Society of Facial Plastic Surgery at a symposium entitled \"Religious Views on Cosmetic Surgery.\"... He concluded6 definitively that plastic surgery for aesthetic enhancement is a form of arrogance and vanity (particularly for men) and is forbidden unless the patient meets certain criteria. He later wrote as part of an overview of the Jewish approach to medicine:</p>\n  \n  <p>In the sparse rabbinic writings on the subject, these reservations could be discounted, provided the danger is minimal; and especially 1) if the operation is medically indicated, e.g. following an accident, or for grave psychological reasons; 2) if the correction of the deformity is designed to facilitate or maintain a happy marriage; or 3) if it will enable a person to play a constructive role in Society and to earn a decent livelihood. 7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, a bit later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1964, ... <strong>Rabbi Mordechai Yaakov Breish</strong>, author of the Chelkas Yaakov and a prominent posek [authority in Jewish law] in Switzerland, discussed the issues of risk and chavala (self-injury) when asked whether a woman may undergo cosmetic surgery to straighten and decrease the size of her nose in order to improve her chance of finding a suitable husband. 10</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He ruled in favor of allowing her to do this. In part,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Citing the psychological pain associated with the inability to find a spouse, Rabbi Breish ruled that the woman may have the cosmetic surgery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A bit later, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The same year, <strong>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein</strong> (1895-1986) was asked the same question... His final ruling permits surgery when it is in the best interests of the patient, even if they are not sick and it does not treat an illness. As a result, he permitted the woman to have cosmetic surgery since it was to her advantage and not being done to harm her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Also in 1964, <strong>Rabbi Menasheh Klein</strong>, author of Mishneh Halachos, dealt with the question of the permissibility of cosmetic surgery to correct various facial imperfections that mar a woman's appearance, such as a very long nose which makes it difficult for her to marry and which she feels makes her very unattractive. </p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishna22 discusses the case of a man who betroths a woman on the condition that she has no defect (mum) where a \"mum\" is defined as any defect that would bar a Cohen (Jewish priest) from serving in the Temple. Tosofos23 states that if the woman had her blemish corrected by a physician before her engagement, the marriage is valid. Since many of the blemishes that would apply to a Cohen include cosmetic imperfections24 of the face for which people today would desire elective plastic surgery and Tosofos permits these blemishes to be corrected by a physician, Rabbi Klein states that it appears that a man or woman may go to a doctor to correct a cosmetic defect merely for enhancement of their appearance. Rabbi Klein rejects the argument that plastic surgery entails any danger whatsoever based the information which he received from physicians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is also a position that it is OK except for the sakanah involved in it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1967, <strong>Rabbi Yitzchak Yaakov Weiss</strong> (1902-1989), head of the Eida Chareidis rabbinical court in Jerusalem and author of Minchas Yitzchak, dealt briefly with the issues of chavala and risk with respect to plastic surgery. 26 He takes the same approach to self-injury as Rabbi Feinstein, arguing that the prohibition of chavala only applies when the wound is inflicted with the intention of causing harm or degradation. He feels that cosmetic surgery would be permitted <strong>if not for</strong> the risk of surgery, which he believes to be a serious concern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A halachic position against plastic surgery, including hashkafically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is one of the major concerns voiced by <strong>Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Waldenberg</strong>, author of Tzitz Eliezer, a multivolume set of responsa, much of which deals with medical issues. First, Rabbi Waldenberg29 objects to performing surgery on someone who is neither sick nor in pain. 30 He argues that such activities are outside the boundaries of the physician's mandate to heal (since he questions whether cosmetic surgery is truly included in the category of healing). He further asserts that the patient has no right to ask the physician to wound him or her for the purposes of merely enhancing beauty. Rabbi Waldenberg then makes the theological argument that as the ultimate artisan, God creates each person in His image, exactly as he or she should be, with nothing extra nor anything lacking. He therefore posits that cosmetic surgery that is not for pain or true illness is an affront to God and is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And finally, Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if the plastic surgery is done to prevent suffering and shame caused by a defect in his looks (for instance a nose which is very abnormal) this would be permitted based on the Tosafot and the Gemara, since the purpose is to remove a blemish. However if the only reason is for beauty, this is not permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For precise sources, follow the link to the article and look at the footnotes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Just to add to the many valid opinions already brought down, Hacham Ovadia Yosef (Yabia Omer C\"M 8:12) permits all forms of plastic surgery for both married and unmarried women and men, as long as they do it by a professional to minimize the risk. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the relevant conclusion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מסקנא דדינא נראה שיש להתיר לנערה לעשות ניתוח פלסטי כדי לשפר את צורתה\n  ויופיה הטבעי למצוא חן בעיני כל רואיה, ושתוכל למצוא שידוך הגון כפי\n  כבודה.   ואפילו אם היא אשה נשואה יש להתיר לה לעשות כן כדי להתחבב יותר\n  על בעלה.   ובלבד שיהיה ע\"י רופא מומחה ובעל נסיון רב, וזריז וזהיר\n  במלאכתו, שלא תצא תקלה מתחת ידו.   וכן נ\"ל להתיר כן גם לאיש שיש מום\n  בפניו או כתמים רבים עד שהוא מתבייש ללכת ככה בין הבריות, וכ\"ש אם זה\n  מפריע לו למצוא עזר כנגדו.   ואין בזה משום לא ילבש גבר שמלת אשה.   וע'\n  בתשובת הגאונים שהובאה באוצר הגאונים (נזיר נח א).   ובמש\"כ בשו\"ת יביע\n  אומר ח\"ו (חיו\"ד סי' יד אות ו).   ואכמ\"ל.   הנלע\"ד כתבתי.   והשי\"ת יאיר\n  עינינו בתורתו אמן.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Funny that today we all think about the need for \"nose jobs\" and cosmetic surgery for noses that are too long; in theory, a nose too short is a disqualification for a Cohen too! For a less vain example, let's talk about the case of the crooked nose (also on the list).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein had allowed rhinoplasty for young woman who felt that her nose was seriously hurting her efforts to find a suitor. It has to do with when one is allowed to have injury caused to one's self (not to mention risk) for valid reasons.</p>\n<p>(From here on out is my own reasoning, not Rabbi Feinstein's.)</p>\n<p>The problem here becomes -- as America today is beginning to realize -- that we can get these very distorted senses of what's \"normal\" and not (e.g. based on the photoshopped faces we see on magazine covers), and before you know it, everyone \"needs\" a nose job. (What about this case of <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3982150,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the newlywed groom who storms into the rabbi's office, furious that he doesn't like the look of his bride's private parts.</a> Is the correct response <em>she may have cosmetic surgery for the sake of their marriage</em>, or is it <em>slap this kid upside the head, yes this is what a real human being looks like so get over it</em>). This is more of a philosophical question.</p>\n<p>Note that Judaism believes in the use of science and technology to cure diseases. So we'd be inclined to say that if someone is actually disfigured, by all means use plastic surgery to \"fix\" them back to \"normal.\" If someone was born with a perfectly fine, healthy nose that isn't quite the latest style these days, well then better to have some faith and be satisfied with one's lot.</p>\n<p>One line that could be proposed is, as mentioned above, based on the list of disqualifying blemishes for a Kohen. If a woman was hiding one of these blemishes and she met a man who married her and thus agreed to paying her Ketubah, upon discovery of the blemish he could void his monetary offer. So it could be suggested that anything on the list (or equally severe) is something that medicine can <em>fix</em> (if we feel it needs fixing! If she was born without eyebrows but both he and she like the look, that's fine too). To try and fix anything else would be hubris.</p>\n<p>As such I'd wonder if, in instances where plastic surgery is indicated, the goal should be an \"averagely-proportioned\" nose, not a \"Hollywood photoshop nose.\" It's amazing how all the people on these plastic-surgery makeover shows wind up looking alike after the procedures.</p>\n\n\n",

A Ben Sorer Umoreh steals meat and wine and scarfs it down. He is addicted to physical pleasures, he will come to do anything to support his habit robbing and killing too. In order to prevent this we kill him before it happens. Drugs go under the same spectrum, that is the people who use the drugs usually become strongly addicted and to maintain their habit might come to the same  unethical behaviors so plainly the reasoning would make marijuana use non Hallachic.</p>\n\n<p>Second, drugs are unhealthy like regular smoking so \"Nishmartem Linafshsechem\". </p>\n\n<p>A third thing Reb Moshe brings that drugs cause a lack of concentration, thereby ruining one Concentration by Teffilah and ability to learn Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth most parents disagree with the behavior, so drug use violates the commandment to \"Honor ones father and mother.\"</p>\n\n<p>Fifth the  Torah says Kedoshim Tihiyu this means there should be a degree of separation from excessive pleasures.

What makes a plant \"kosher\" is not the specific species of plant (which is what determines the kashrut of something from the animal kingdom), but how and where it was grown, and the laws that apply to it once you want to use it. All of these laws fully apply in the Land of Israel when there is a Temple standing. Some apply (sometimes in a more limited way) at all times in the Land of Israel.

Since the kohen cannot eat it today (because he cannot become ritually pure), it is separated and burned. But dough that didn't have challa separated is non-kosher.</li>\n<li>The \"new\" grain (<em>chadash</em>) cannot be eaten until the <em>omer</em> offering is harvested on the 2nd night of Pesach (Passover). Today, we must still wait for the 2nd day of Pesach until eating new grain.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>You won't find that YHWH declared ALL plants \"kosher\" in Scripture at any point in time, even before the curse. You're forgetting the very first plant He ever prohibited: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>\n\n<p>But not to jump too far ahead, according to Genesis (or Bereshiyt) 1:29-30, YHWH gave criteria that defined what plants mankind could eat as food out of all the plants that He created. So, YHWH did not create ALL plants to be eaten by us. This applies across the board—not just to Israel, but to all human beings since we're talking about the first human pair, Adam and Eve, in Genesis 1-3. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Genesis 1:29-30 (NIV)</p>\n\n<p>29 Then God said, “I give you every <strong>seed-bearing</strong> plant \non the face of the whole earth and every tree that has\n<strong>fruit with seed in it</strong>. <strong>They will be yours for food</strong>. \n30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds \nin the sky and all the creatures that move along the \nground—everything that has the breath of life in it—\nI give every green plant for food.” And it was so.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>According to those verses, the plants that YHWH designed for us (mankind) to eat were plants that bore seeds—or trees that bore fruit <em>with seed in it</em>; in contrast, <em>every</em> green plant was given to the animals (not to us). </p>\n\n<p>To provide a practical example of this distinction: animals, like rabbits and deer, can safely eat grass and benefit from it; we can't.</p>\n\n<p>Animals:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most herbivores, such as cows buffaloes, goats, sheep \n  and deer, eat grass. Animals that live in the forest \n  eat grass, twigs, plants and leaves. Horses eat hay, \n  which is dry grass. Even insects such as grasshoppers \n  eat grass. Elephants love to eat the bark of trees, \n  but even elephants eat grass. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.reference.com/science/animals-eat-grass-f19a6233ebe5e0b6#\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.reference.com/science/animals-eat-grass-f19a6233ebe5e0b6#</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But humans:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In principle, people can eat grass; it is non-toxic\n  and edible. As a practical food source, however, your\n  lawn leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are two main problems with a grass diet. \n  The first is that human stomachs have difficulty \n  digesting raw leaves and grasses. Animals such as\n  cows, on the other hand, have a specialized \n  stomach with four chambers to aid in the digestion\n  of grass (a process called rumination).</p>\n  \n  <p>Aside from the digestion issues, a second problem \n  with grass as a food source is the mastication. \n  Your dentist would not be pleased; grass contains \n  a lot of silica, an abrasive which quickly wears \n  down teeth. Grazing animals have teeth that are \n  adapted to continually grow, replacing the worn \n  tooth surfaces quickly.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.livescience.com/32435-why-cant-humans-eat-grass.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, no, not all plants should be eaten by man (ergo, not all plants are \"kosher\"; I'm assuming we're using \"kosher\" in the way that YHWH, through Moses, used the term \"tahor\" [טָהוֹר] H#2889, in Leviticus 11:47, to distinguish the living creatures we may eat in contrast to the \"tame\"[טָמֵא] H#2931, the living creatures we may not eat).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leviticus 11:47 (NIV)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>47 You must distinguish between the unclean \n and the clean, between living creatures that\n may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.’”</p>\n\n<p>\"Kosher\"—a term that does not appear in the written Torah—literally means \"clean / pure\". But the Hebrew term that appears in Leviticus 11, in the written Torah, is \"tahor\". \"Tahor\" (clean) applies to \"what may be eaten\". Even though the terms \"tahor\" (clean) and \"tame\" (unclean) are not used of plants, the concept that it represents (\"may be eaten\" from \"what may not be eaten\") is: some plants may be eaten, some plants may not eaten. Ergo, not all plants may be eaten by man, just like not all animals may be eaten by man. </p>\n\n<p>Technically, all plants and animals CAN be eaten (not may, not should, but can be eaten) by man—you can chew and swallow them—but that doesn't mean you should; YHWH sees a negative repercussion that we can't see; so, if it's not conducive to our good, in the immediate or in the long run, then YHWH Commanded against eating it. For the same reason, He set the distinctions for other things <em>besides</em> plants and the meat of animals: </p>\n\n<p>Out of all the criteria YHWH gave us, for our own good, we also must not eat blood (Leviticus 17:13-15), and not surprisingly blood is a carrier for pathogens; the fat is also prohibited (Leviticus 3:17; 7:24), not surprisingly, toxins get stored in the fat; the liver and kidneys and the fat surrounding these organs are also prohibited (Leviticus 3:4), and not surprisingly, these organs filter out the toxins in the body [thus, there is toxin in that organ]. Of what is <em>not</em> mentioned explicitly, but is obvious (in our day anyway, can't speak for future generations): we also must not eat poop, nor wood, nor stones. Just because YHWH created it and it's not an animal, that doesn't mean we can eat it. Those aren't \"food\" (a thing to be eaten) either.  </p>\n\n<p>After the fall, things like thorns and thistles came up from the ground (I assume poison ivy arose at this time too, considering that it has berries [fruit] with seed in it, thus fits Genesis 1 criteria, but is poisonous to us; ergo is not a part of YHWH's original \"very good\" creation in the beginning, but a result of the cursed earth i.e. Genesis 3:17-19). So we can't go by Genesis 1 criteria alone (though Genesis 1 criteria already had its own limits too, but once man sinned, more limits were placed because we messed creation up to our own discomfort and detriment).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Genesis 3:17-19 (NIV)</p>\n\n<p>17 To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’</p>\n\n<p>“<strong>Cursed is the ground</strong> because of you;\n through painful toil you will eat food from it\n all the days of your life.\n18 <strong>It will produce thorns and thistles for you,</strong>\n and you will eat the plants of the field.\n19 By the sweat of your brow\n you will eat your food\nuntil you return to the ground,\n since from it you were taken;\nfor dust you are\n and to dust you will return.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short: the question you asked assumes something to be true that is actually not true at all: YHWH did not say ALL plants were \"kosher\" (nor that all plants were \"tahor\"), clean, \"may be eaten\". YHWH Commanded that only the seed-bearing plants and the trees that bear fruit with seed in it may be eaten—with the exception of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was totally forbidden. And after Adam and Eve's sin, there were even more plants that we could not eat of because of the cursed ground. Just like some animals are off-limits, some plants are off-limits too—for our own good.</p>\n\n\n",

The recommended approach in that case is to disqualify it by removing some of the sechach, or (if that's not possible) to bring in utensils that don't normally belong in a sukkah, such as pots, thus demonstrating that you're treating it as a plain old hut.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't necessary anytime after that, though, because it's obvious that it's not meant as an extension of the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%95\">Aruch Hashulchan, Orach Chaim 666</a>:2,4)</p>\n\n<p>So far, this is talking about eating in the sukkah after Sukkos.

Now I would say that's in bad taste, but they were pagans and would worship in strange ways, like defecating to their gods, so this is just par for the course. Here is what throws me off: We save it and store it by the Ahron Kodesh with the Luchos! What is the deeper significance of these two type of gifts that they were bestowed such a great honor? Let me clarify: why did the Jews feel it important to memorialize this gift?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>\"The box in which the Philistines sent a gift to the G-d of Israel was placed next to it\" (Bava Basra 14a).</p>\n\n<p>To expand on Shalom's answer:</p>\n\n<p>The basic reason that the Philistines made these particular images is that these were the plagues they had been struck with (I Sam. 5:6 and Rashi there). Malbim (to 6:4-5) explains that the Philistine \"priests and magicians\" (6:2) had two points in mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>G-d's punishments always relate in some way to the type of sin committed. So they informed the people that evidently their sin (in taking the Aron) could be depicted using these forms, and therefore these would be an appropriate way to show their penance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Human doctors cure diseases using their opposites; indeed, having the disease-causing agent around can worsen the patient's condition (he gives the example, from Yoma 84a, of a person bitten by a mad dog seeing any dog afterwards). By contrast, Hashem heals using the same agent with which He causes sickness, as with Moshe's copper snake. By making images of the very plagues that afflicted them, the Philistines would demonstrate that they recognized these plagues to have come from G-d rather than as natural happenstance.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As for the fact that this box was given such a place of honor next to the Aron (and even hidden away with it, Yoma 52b), the Aruch Laner <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33811&pgnum=200\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Minchas Ani to Parshas Korach)</a> suggests that this is meant to implicitly refute the argument that the non-Jews won't respect us if we study Torah rather than their sciences. Here we see, to the contrary, that the Philistines respected the Torah so much as to send along a gift when they returned it! And that serves as a lesson for all time.</p>\n\n<p>Another point, too, is that <strong>this was the first time in history that an entire non-Jewish people recognized G-d's power and tried to appease Him</strong>. This deserves to be highlighted, as indeed the verse does, listing each of the five major Philistine cities and its \"golden hemorrhoid\" separately and in a festive tone <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39788&pgnum=74\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(6:17, see Daas Soferim)</a>. It therefore also deserves to be placed in the Kodesh Hakodashim, as the first step in the long process towards the time when all of the peoples of the world will achieve this realization, with the coming of Moshiach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Philistines had been afflicted by hemhorroids, which were then irritated by rats, as a punishment for stealing the Ark.</p>\n\n<p>By their thinking, they could appease the Ark (or whatever force behind it) and stop this nuisance by returning the Ark, along with some golden rats and golden hemhorroids, for good measure. Nothing to do with how they worshipped; it had to do with what they wanted! (Or \"wanted to stop\"!)</p>\n\n<p>I suspect part of why the Jews left the gift in-place was to remember this episode. A.) The Ark is great enough that it was recognized by other nations. B.) Don't take it for granted, it could be taken away. (A message Jeremiah kept trying to impart to his people regarding the Temple a few centuries later, while they continued to rest on their laurels.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a whole dvar torah on this but to summarize:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One of the ways we degrade avoda zara is by relating it to excrement (avodas gilulim)</li>\n<li>Avimelech, king of the plishtim, was punished by having orifices stopped up</li>\n<li>The midrash explains that the 7 presents Avraham gave Avimelech afterwards let to 7 calamities in Jewish history. One of which being the Plishtim capturing the Aron.</li>\n<li>The Plishtim were punished with hemorrhoids to show both the folly of their idol and how they had abrogated the covenant with Avraham.</li>\n<li>Their gift was in essence an acquiescing to the denigration of their idol. </li>\n<li>Outside validation, by our enemies, is seen as a lasting kiddush Hashem (for example we sing Ma Tovu Ohalecha, which is a statement of Bilam validating the encampment of Yisroel).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How many rafters invalidate the sukkah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From my understanding, the roof of a sukkah might consist of two components: rafters and schach. </p>\n\n<p>(Although it seems to me that often the rafters themselves are valid schach, I am under the impression that rafters can be fastened down and provide the sukkah with structural support, while the schach may not. Also, the rafters that the schach rests on must be natural material such as lumber, but the rafters may rest on other materials like plastic or metal. All this to say there is a clear distinction between the rafters and the schach. Right?)</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: at what point do you have too many rafters? For example, if the rafters themselves block 50 percent of the sunlight, is the sukkah still valid?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You are implying a number of questions that have dependent, but distinct answers:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Why can't rafters be sechach?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although on a Torah level rafters are valid sechach, the sages prohibited using \"nesarim\" (manufactured wood planks) which are thicker than 4 hand-breadths, suspecting people may see no reason to sit in a sukkah if their own home's roof is constructed in the same way.  This is codified in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&st=&pgnum=181\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 629:18</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The S.A. also brings a custom not to use nesarim which are smaller than 4 hand-breadths.  The Mishna Berurah 49 explains this is for one of two reasons:</p>\n\n<p>a. This may cause people to build their nesarim schach in a way that doesn't let the rain in</p>\n\n<p>b.  People started building their roofs out of planks smaller than 4 hand-breadths, so these would also be included in the original prohibition of nesarim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.Why can you fasten the rafters with, or rest the rafters on metal or plastic, but cannot do so with the schach?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&st=&pgnum=179\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 629:7</a> questions whether one may place a wood ladder on the sukkah and place more schach on top.  While many interpret this as questioning whether a ladder is considered kosher schach, there is an opinion (that we try to keep) that  there may be an problem supporting schach with a material that is invalid for schach.  So while supporting schach with metal or plastic does not invalidate the sukkah, we try not to do so (MB 22).</p>\n\n<p>However, as we see from S.A. O.C. 629:8, there is no issue of using invalid schach materials to support the supporters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.  What amount of rafters will invalidate a sukkah:</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to reasoning \"a\" in the first question, you will not invalidate the sukkah as long as the rafters are less than 4 hand-breadths.  </p>\n\n<p>According to reasoning \"b\", the rafters will be considered invalid schach.  Those laws require a different question.</p>\n\n\n",

I would love to go there and feel the holiness of the place</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>According to the Ra'avad, Har Habayis (Temple Mount) does not have Kedusha nowadays, so there would be no halachik issue with visiting any part of it. However, most poskim assume like the Rambam that Har Habayis retains its kedusha even though the Beis haMikdash has been destroyed. </p>\n\n<p>This means people can only visit areas that are allowed based on their level of taharah/tu'mah. Nowadays, we assume everyone is <em>tamei meis</em>, so md'oraysa no one can go into the <strong>azara</strong> (Temple Courtyard), and md'rabanan one cannot go past the <strong>cheil</strong> (a gate the encircled both the Azara and Ezras Nashim). </p>\n\n<p>A person with a <em>tumah yotzei megufo</em> cannot go into Har haBayis. He therefore needs to immerse in a kosher mikvah beforehand, and he can then go in any area outside the cheil. </p>\n\n<p>No one claims there is a <em>halachik</em> problem with someone who toveled from going on har haBayis outside the cheil. The issue they raise is that perhaps we don't know where the Mikdash and Azara were and one may accidentally go into it. However, there is a large area from the outside of har habayis to the azara, so this doesn't explain why one couldn't go a few feet into har habayis. (There is also both a tradition and other evidence that the Dome of the Rock is where the Kodesh haK'doshim  was.)</p>\n\n<p>Many feel one shouldn't go on har habayis because Jews didn't go in the previous few centuries. However, this was because Jews were banned from going on it. Previously, when Jews were allowed to go on Har Habyis, many did so, such as the Rambam and the Radvaz. </p>\n\n<p>While many rabbis say one should not go on har haBayis, the reasons are not so clear-cut, and the basic halacha does allow it. Some Rabbis feel its important <em>to</em> go on har haBayis, since it shows the Jews still care about it, and it is an opportunity to keep the mitzvah of mora'ah (reverence) for the mikdash, and the mitzvah of distinguishing between the permitted and forbidden areas.</p>\n\n<p>It is important that one who goes on har haBayis knows the basic halachos of tumah/taharah, which areas one can go, and the halachos of mora'ah (e.g. no shoes allowed). </p>\n\n<p>See also:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/article/tzarich_iyun_har_habayit\">http://www.ou.org/torah/article/tzarich_iyun_har_habayit</a>\n<a href=\"http://templemountcenter.com/Aliya_English.html\">http://templemountcenter.com/Aliya_English.html</a> </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are those that hold you may, however the majority of contemporary Poskim hold you may not.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.templeinstitute.org/archive/25-01-05.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.templeinstitute.org/archive/25-01-05.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>This link goes to a website that supports going to the Temple Mount. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.templeinstitute.org/main.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.templeinstitute.org/main.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

I particularly noticed this during Sukkot with two similar ones in proximity; it's \"likro et hahallel\" but \"al mikra megillah\" (which led me in a roundabout way to ask <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10695/472\">this question</a>).  Why the difference?</p>\n\n<p>I first thought that it might be the difference between something we do actively (we all say hallel) and something we experience more passively (most of us don't personally read the megillah; someone does on our behalf), but that doesn't work -- \"al netilat (yadayim, lulav)\" and \"al achilat (matzah, maror)\" are counter-examples.  The difference also doesn't seem to be d'oraita versus d'rabbanan; both forms show up in both categories.</p>\n\n<p>Is there significance, or in each case did the rabbis just choose between two equally-appropriate formulations and it doesn't mean anything more than that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26840&pgnum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avudraham discusses this</a> at length. He brings several different classification methods offered by different people. It seems that each classification method covers a large percentage of the cases, but there are some exceptions. The Abudraham then discusses some of the exceptions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>First he brings the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam (brought in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10706/why-are-there-two-different-forms-of-the-mitzvah-brachot-l-and-al/10708#10708\">yydl's answer</a>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the mitzvah is (completely) done right away, we say <strong>\"Al\"</strong>.

Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>‫‫לישב בסוכה‬</li>\n<li>‫ לשמוע קול שופר‬(There are pauses before it's done)</li>\n<li>Hallel (You need to wait for people to respond)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Furthermore, Rabbeinu Tam offers another reason why Hallel is \"L'Kro\" and not \"Al Mikrat Hallel\" (or some variation). Any Mitzvah that is not a constant obligation you do not say \"Al\". Since we are commanded to say Hallel after surviving any calamity (as opposed to specific times) it is not considered a constant obligation. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Abudraham does not like this answer, saying that this classification doesn't seem to have any logic behind it, and most of the reasons given for the exceptions seem a little weak. He also brings cases that contradict Rebbeinu Tam's classification system.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Then he brings the Rambam (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=13969&rid=1116\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 11:15</a>), who makes the following distinctions. The Rambam holds that the blessing may change depending on who is saying it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you (a) do the mitzvah for yourself and (b) it is an obligation, you say \"<strong>L'</strong>\", otherwise you say \"<strong>Al</strong>\". For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Circumcision</li>\n<li>Making a fence around a roof</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>If you do those same Mitzvot as an emissary for someone else, you would say \"<strong>Al</strong> </p></li>\n<li><p>If you are doing a mitzvah for yourself and others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If it is an optional Mitzvah, you say \"<strong>Al</strong>\" - e.g. Eiruv</li>\n<li>If it is an obligatory mitzvah, you say \"<strong>L'</strong>\" - e.g. Shofar</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>If it is an optional mitzvah, you say \"<strong>Al</strong>\", whether you are doing it yourself or not. For example: Shechita</p></li>\n<li><p>If the blessing precedes the action, you say \"<strong>L'</strong>\". The the action precedes the blessing you say \"<strong>Al</strong>\". For Example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since just picking up the Arba Minim fulfills your obligation, you say \"<strong>Al Netilat Lulav</strong>\". If you say the blessing before you pick up the Minim, you say \"<strong>Litol Lulav</strong>\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>(The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's classification. Among the distinctions he offers and ultimately rejects is the distinction between Rabinical and Biblical commandments. The Raavad also brings cases that don't conform to the Rambam's classification system)</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Abudraham the brings another opinion he does not name. It appears to be the Riva <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10721/603\">mentioned in @msh10's answer</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the Mitzvah (a) can be done by proxy (shliach), and (b) will be done in the future (L'Habah) you say \"<strong>Al</strong>\"</li>\n<li>If the Mitzvah (a) can not be done by proxy (shliach), and (b) will be done in the future (L'Habah) you say \"<strong>L'</strong>\"</li>\n<li>If the Mitzvah (a) can be done by proxy (shliach), and (b) was done in the past (L'She'avar) you say \"<strong>L'</strong>\"</li>\n<li><p>If the Mitzvah (a) can not be done by proxy (shliach), and (b) was done in the past (L'She'avar) you say \"<strong>Al</strong>\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The exceptions are then discussed.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, with regards to the Sukkot we say \"Al Netilat Lulav\", but say \"Leisheiv BaSukkah\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to Rabbienu Tam, the mitzvah of Lulav is over as soon as you pick up the lulav, but the mitzvah of sitting in a Sukkah extends.</li>\n<li>According to the Rambam, both Sukkah and Lulav are Mitzvot you are personally obligated to do, but as soon as you pick up the Lulav you've fulfilled your obligation, so you say \"Al Netilat Lulav\", but if you say the blessing before you pick it up you say \"LiTol Lulav\"</li>\n<li>According to the third opinion, you say \"Leishev BaSukah\" since the mitzvah can't be done by proxy and the main mitzvah is eating and drinking in the Sukkah, which is done after the blessing. The blessing on the Lulav on the other hand, is only done after you've already picked it up (thus fulfilling your obligation), and thus you say \"Al Netilat Lulav\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>‬</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Not all that much here not already in other answers, but for (more) completeness I'll quote <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37955&pgnum=260\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Rabenu Asher</em> (\"<em>Rosh</em>\"), in his <em>halachos</em> to <em>P'sachim</em> 7B</a> (in my own loose translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Rabenu Tam</em> explained that all <em>mitzvos</em> done immediately, we say \"<em>al</em>\" on, like \"<em>al mikra m'gila</em>\", \"<em>hat'vila</em>\", \"<em>n'tilas yadayim</em>\", \"<em>hafrashas t'ruma</em>\", \"<em>achilas matza</em>\" and \"<em>maror</em>\". But \"<em>l'haniach t'filin</em>\", \"<em>l'his'atef batzitzis</em>\", \"<em>leshev basuka</em>\" — these involve delay. The wording [\"<em>l'-</em>\"] implies as much: \"to be adorned with <em>t'filin</em>\", \"to be wrapped in <em>tzitzis</em>\", \"to dwell in a <em>suka</em>, eating and spending all day\". As to \"<em>l'hadlik ner Chanuka</em>\", it, too, has delay: the <em>mitzva</em> is \"from sunset until traffic leaves the street\". Likewise \"<em>lishmoa kol shofar</em>: there's delay among the blasts, as the main <em>mitzva</em> is blowing with each <em>b'racha</em> [of the <em>amida</em>]. The difference between <em>halel</em> (\"<em>l'-</em>\") and <em>m'gila</em> (\"<em>al</em>\") is that the latter is read straight through whereas <em>halel</em> has pauses for responsive reading. Moreover, <em>halel</em> was originally meant to be read for the community's being saved from any trouble, so we use \"<em>l'-</em>\": any <em>mitzva</em> that's not a steady obligation doesn't get \"<em>al</em>\". \"<em>L'hachniso</em>\" [at a <em>b'ris</em>] is because it's not a <em>b'racha</em> on the <em>mitzva</em> at all (it's not even said beforehand), but one of praise for having the <em>mitzva</em>. And hand <em>t'filin</em> get \"<em>l'-</em>\" while the head get \"<em>al</em>\" because the rabbis didn't want to have two the same in a row; the head gets \"<em>al</em>\" as it's the final part of the <em>mitzva</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37955&pgnum=261\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Riva</em> differed:</a> On any <em>mitzva</em> than can be done via an agent, say \"<em>al</em>\"; on others, \"<em>l'-</em>\". That's why the <em>g'mara</em> implied that \"<em>lamul</em>\" means he himself circumcises. <em>Shofar</em> gets \"<em>l'-</em>\" because he must hear it himself; <em>halel</em>, unlike <em>m'gila</em>, because even one hearing <em>halel</em> from another must say certain parts. Even though personal <em>t'vila</em> can't be done through agency, that of dishes can, so both got \"<em>al</em>\"; moreover, because of <em>t'vila</em> of converts, which gets \"<em>al</em>\" because it's said only after the <em>mitzva</em> is done. Similarly <em>lulav</em>: sometimes the <em>b'racha</em> is made after the <em>mitzva</em> is done, so it gets \"<em>al</em>\"; and the same for <em>n'tilas yadayim</em>. (\"<em>L'-</em>\" implies future.) <em>Chanuka</em> lights get \"<em>al</em>\" even though agency works because people don't use agents for it: everyone likes to light his own (they love the miracle); same for <em>Shabas</em> lights. <em>Omer</em> counting gets \"<em>al</em>\" because the congregational leader counts aloud for those who can't. As for <em>t'filin</em>, the <em>b'racha</em> is really \"<em>...v'mitzvas t'filin</em>\" [neither \"<em>al</em>\" nor \"<em>l'-</em>\"] (and <em>Rif</em> agrees with that). Likewise, \"<em>laasok b'divre sora</em>\" is the correct wording of that <em>b'racha</em>, per the <em>Ashk'naz</em> wording.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to <em>Riva</em>, one would therefore say \"<em>leechol matza</em>\" and \"<em>leechol maror</em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, <em>Rabenu Tam</em> holds that it depends on immediacy of the <em>mitzva</em> only, except that an exception is made when two <em>birchos hamitzva</em> are done in a row or when the <em>mitzva</em> is required under unplanned, occasional circumstances (or something like that). <em>Riva</em> holds that it depends on whether the <em>mitzva</em> is (at least under some circumstances) often done by an agent and on whether the <em>b'racha</em> is (at least under some circumstances) said after the <em>mitzva</em> is done: if either is true, say \"<em>al</em>\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is more than one way to distinguish between the two categories.

    "content": "# Shaving on Chol Hamoed\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>May a man shave his beard in a kosher manner on Chol Hamoed?</p>\n\n<p>(Sefira considerations aside)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik and others are of the opinion that it is permitted for one who regularly shaves to shave, and since it is permitted it is a mitzva to do so, so as not to look disgraceful on chol hamoed <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/moadim71/32-71moed.htm\">(Source</a>). Rav Moshe Feinstein makes a similar argument in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&pgnum=285\">Igrot Moshe OC I 163</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Version:</strong> The Mishna in Moed Katan 3:1 (page <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=12&daf=13b&format=pdf\">13b</a> in the Bavli) lists 7 people who are allowed to get haircuts on chol hamoed, implying that everyone else is forbidden to get a haircut on chol hamoed. The gemara there (14a) wonders why is this so? Even though cutting hair is one of the 39 categories of forbidden labor (\"Gozeiz\"), shouldn't it be permitted on chol hamoed by the rule of \"tzorech hamoed\" -- that labor which is performed for the sake of the holiday may be performed on chol hamoed? Surely getting a haircut to look nice is for the sake of the holiday! The gemara answers that there is a rabbinic decree forbidding haircuts on chol hamoed, to encourage people to get their haircuts before the holiday and not wait until they are free from work on chol hamoed. The mishna's exceptions are cases of people who could not for various reasons get a haircut before the holiday; for them there is a dispensation to allow haircuts on chol hamoed because the end goal is to have people look nice during the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Now comes the important question: can we extend beyond the seven cases of the mishna? The gemara asks about one who was busy all of Erev Chag searching for a lost object and did not have an opportunity to get a haircut before the holiday. The gemara answers that he may not get a haircut on chol hamoed as his having been stuck is not obvious and eveyone may come to claim that they were stuck and can take a haircut. Rather, it says, only someone whose reason for not getting a haircut is apparent to all is permitted to get a haircut on chol hamoed.</p>\n\n<p>At this point it should be clear that a man who is regularly clean shaven may shave on chol hamoed, for it is obvious to all that he was unable prior to the holiday to shave the hairs that hadn't grown yet! And since it is <em>permitted</em> for him to shave, it becomes a mitzva for him to do so, because as we said, the end goal is to have people look nice during the holiday.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos6_15.htm#_ftnref17\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch prohibits shaving (<em>Simon 531:2, SS”K 66:23</em>) and it is the prevalent custom.

The Tur strongly disagrees and seemingly all subsequent authorities were stringent.

    "content": "# Should a man say Shehecheyanu when lighting Yom Tov candles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a situation when a man will both be lighting the Yom Tov candles and making Kiddush, when should he make Shehecheyanu?</p>\n\n<p>Do we say only when lighting candles, since that is when the women say it when they light candles (and perhaps because that is the earliest possible opportunity)?</p>\n\n<p>Do we say that they should only say it when making Kiddush, since that is when it would normally be said?</p>\n\n<p>Or, are there certain times when men would say the blessing both times, such as when the Shehecheyanu in Kiddush also applies to another Mitzvah of the day. For example, would the man say Shehechyanu both when lighting the candles on the second day of Rosh Hashana, and during Kiddush when we are supposed to have in mind a new fruit or garment when saying the Shehecheyanu (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&pgnum=140\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 600:2</a>)?</p>\n\n<p>And, assuming the man is supposed to say it twice, what does he do if already said it when he lit the candles and he doesn't have a new fruit or garment? (Normally Shulchan Aruch says to say it anyway, but in this case he has already said it when he lit the candles)</p>\n\n<p>Take Sukkot as an example. The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&pgnum=219\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 641:1</a>) tells us that the Shehecheyanu we say on the first night of Sukkot is also being said for the Sukkah. If for some reason you said Shehecheyanu on the first night of Sukkot outside the Sukkah you repeat it the first time you sit in the Sukkah. If so, it would stand to reason that if the man said it when he lit candles he would still repeat it when making Kiddush in the Sukkah. In such a situation, should the man skip it when he lights candles and only say it in Kiddush, or should he say it twice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Say it only during kiddush. The women too should only say it during kiddush. Why would one assume the two would be any different? They are both obligated in kiddush and both obligated to have the lights lit. The Talmud in Sukkah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=47b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">47b</a>) implies already that the shehechiyanu is said with the kiddush. (The Tur OC 519 deems it an \"enactment of [the sages] to say it [then].\") I see no reason to distinguish between genders.</p>\n\n<p>Some more discussion: The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&pgnum=74\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Brurah (263:23)</a> and Rav Moshe Feinstein (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=190\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igros Moshe OC 4:101</a>) both point out that the custom of some women to say shehechiyanu when lighting has no basis, but one does not need to protest against women who do so. Moreover, Rav Ovadiah Yosef (Yechavveh Da'at 3:34) actually recommends stopping the practice because it is preferable to say the shehechiyanu on kiddush (and quotes a slew of opinions who agree with him, as he is wont to do). The only reason it seems that no one has fully condemned the practice is because everyone agrees that the bracha is not levattala: the gemara referenced above explicitly permits one to say shehechiyanu while standing in the market and this is indeed what most men do on Yom Kippur. But it is clear that the ideal time is to say it with kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure why one would continue to teach their daughters this minhag. But all the more so why a man who happens to be lighting candles one yom tov would give up the shehechiyanu on kiddush for candles when there is <em>no reason</em> for him to do so!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The only reason we deliberately have new fruit or clothes is because we're saying it anyway on <em>kidush</em> or lighting: if you're (for whatever reason) not saying it on <em>kidush</em> or lighting, there's no reason to have new fruit or clothes. (Of course, if you <em>do</em> have new fruit or clothes, then you say <em>shehecheyanu</em>, same as on any weekday.)</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, saying it at <em>kidush</em> or lighting is saying it for the day: so you only say it one of those two times, not both. But I don't know which one.</p>\n\n<p>(As noted (in a comment on this answer and then in the revised question), <em>Sukos</em> would seem to be an exception because the <em>b'racha</em> is said for the <em>suka</em> as well as for the <em>yom tov</em> (<em>Rama</em> 641), so <em>if</em> a man said it on lighting in his home then he'd repeat it in the <em>suka</em>. Again, I don't know when he should say it. And there may be other, similar exceptions, though I can't think of any.)</p>\n\n\n",

Below is my personal opinion on this weighty topic. </p>\n\n<p>I think such an exchange is forbidden. While the mitzvah to redeem captives is extremely important, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=45&format=pdf\">the Mishnah</a> says they cannot be redeemed for more than their value. The gemara gives 2 explanations for this - either because its too much of a burden on the tzibbur, or it will encourage future kidnappings of Jews. If they see that Jews pay extra to free their captives, they will try to capture more Jews. Chazal recognized this issue and decreed one should \"foresees the consequences\" and leave one Jew in captivity so as not to cause more Jews to suffer in the future. </p>\n\n<p>In that case, the captors are not looking to kill Jews, they just want to make money. Yet the halacha says one cannot pay them extra money so as not to encourage them in the future. Surely if the captors are sworn enemies of the Jews who want to kill them and destroy their country, we cannot ransom a captive more than his cost! How can we give aid to them when it will just be used in their war against the Jews? To release multiple terrorists for one captive is not a \"fair trade\" and is more than the cost. And this is much worse than giving the captors money, since the very terrorists released often go back to committing terrorism themselves against the Jews. In addition, uneven trades strengthens the hand of the enemy by handing them a \"victory\" that they can use to gain more power.  </p>\n\n<p>Since Israel started doing these trades it has caused nothing but harm. The <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,109812,00.html\">encouragement</a> given to the terrorists helped cause both Lebanon wars and provided the terrorists with much manpower. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed by terrorists released in these trades. </p>\n\n<p>These swaps also harm morale since soldiers risk their lives to capture these terrorists and then see a thousand released for one person. A soldier who goes to war knows he's risking his life for his country and may be killed in battle. The fact that he is captured does not mean that hundreds of future lives must be risked to save him. Instead, the enemy should be hit back with force, so they know kidnappings will not help them. </p>\n\n\n",

But because it's difficult to remember them (particularly before siddurim began to be written), in Babylonia the ומנחתם ונסכיהם paragraph was created to regularize the description of that part of the korban (which in the Torah has various subtle variations from day to day).</p>\n\n<p>[Other Geonim held (based on Rosh Hashanan 35a, see Rashi there ד\"ה כיון and אין צריך) that even that's not necessary; the Sephardic nusach to this day follows suit, and omits the pesukim of the korbanos (and ומנחתם ונסכיהם) entirely. On the other hand, Rashi eventually accepted the position of R. Meir Shliach Tzibbur (the author of Akdamus) that they should be recited, and this became the Ashkenazic practice.]</p>\n\n<p>As for Shabbos, Rashi writes that its pesukim were always recited in Ashkenazic communities even before R. Meir came along, \"because they are constant and [therefore] familiar.\" So there was probably also less of a need to use ומנחתם ונסכיהם to replace any part of those two pesukim. (Also, anyway it would be factually incorrect - דובר שקרים - to use it in its standard form, since there is no שעיר לכפר on Shabbos.)</p>\n\n\n",

Are there job opportunities in smaller communities out of New York, for people looking to go into the Rabbinate? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>At the risk of answering a question that might get closed for being too vague:</p>\n\n<p>1) It depends and 2) It depends.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, a rabbi being paid for leading a congregation will be subject to how much value that rabbi will bring to the congregation. In many instances, this will translate to \"How dynamic is the rabbi?\" (I.E. Can he bring in a bunch of people who otherwise might not come?), \"What is the rabbi's stance on halacha?\" (I.E. does the rabbi's stance fit with the stance of the congregation itself?) and \"How much of a leader is the rabbi?\" (I.E. is the rabbi willing to be a yes-man to the president of the synagogue board?).</p>\n\n<p>As for job-opportunities, it really depends on where you're willing to look. Most big cities have long-established rabbis (or they know of places where they can go when they need someone new). Smaller, more rural areas will probably look for a rabbi more as someone who can give some nice speeches without preaching fire and brimstone to the congregation (the farther away jews have to go to the synagogue, the less likely you will find an orthodox community). This is not to say that there aren't orthodox rabbis in small areas - but those are usually placed there by Chabad or some other similar organization (I.E. someone with deep pockets who can pay for a rabbi that otherwise wouldn't get offered a job).</p>\n\n<p>If you can get a job with a large congregation (200+ people on a weekly basis) and/or you work for a liberal temple, you can probably make a decent salary (I won't even hazard a guess as to how much most rabbis get paid). Most other rabbis, though, usually have to supplement their income with other jobs (such as teaching in a school nearby). Being a rabbi is a tough calling. If you're able to do it, more power to you. But don't expect a big payday unless you work for a Syrian-Jewish synagogue in New York.</p>\n\n\n",

Kohelet teaches the same thing. </p>\n\n<p>(One can expound immensely on this)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Sukkot is called \"The Holiday of Gathering\", since it is the time of the in-gathering of the crops. At this time one, feeling flush with his successful agricultural endeavors, may forget to attribute the success to G-d (as promised in Sefer Devarim).</p>\n\n<p>In order to remember G-d's role in our work, we move into a temporary dwelling (sukkah) where we can see the heavens and remember G-d.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason we read Kohelet, which \"<em>is full of earnest thoughts and reflections on the \"vanity of vanities\" of this world. It fittingly concludes with\nthe words, \"The end of the matter after all is heard, is:\nFear G-d and keep His commandments, for this is the\nwhole purpose of man.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15622&st=&pgnum=148\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Complete Story of Tishrei (pg. 147)</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I heard a really nice dvar Torah about this over Sukkot.</p>\n\n<p>At one point in time, Kohelet was debated as to whether it should be part of the Tanach or not.  One argument against Kohelet was that it is confusing and contradictory. In one verse it says that Simcha is Good, in another verse it says that Simcha leads to sin and is therefore Bad.  (There are many such examples)  However, one of the reason this argument was refuted was because Kohelet also makes us think.  Yes it is full of contradictions, but in the end it makes us think and brings us closer to Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>The holiday of Sukkot, is also full of these 'contradictions'.  On the one hand, The etrog is alone and considered to be the Talmud Chacham. On the other hand, we have the Lulav which is made up of 3 types of non-Talmud Chachams all with their pitfalls.  But we bring them together, and the Lulav is considered greater than the Etrog.  On Sukkot, we go outside but build for ourselves booths so we go out to go in.  During the rest of the year we seperate ourselves from Non-Jews, but on Sukkoth the non Jews are invited to the Temple as well, and we bring sacrifices for them.</p>\n\n<p>So in Short. Just as in Kohelet, the good and the bad are brought together, so too in Sukkot the good and the bad are brought together all towards one purpose... serving Hashem. (And it makes us think)</p>\n\n<p>The follow up question to this though, is why do only Ashanazim read Kohelet on Sukkot?</p>\n\n\n",

And what is the source for this custom?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The source is the Gemara, Sukkah 43b-44b, which calls this practice מנהג נביאים (a custom instituted by the prophets) or יסוד נביאים (a practice established by them). (The Gemara ends up ruling that the first version is correct, and that therefore we don't say a berachah for it.)</p>\n\n<p>On 43b and 44b the Gemara mentions, in this connection, חיבוט of the aravah. (The following mishnah, on 45a, also mentions the opinion of R. Yochanan ben Berokah that in the Beis Hamikdash, they would חובטין palm branches - rather than aravos - on Hoshana Rabbah.) Rashi on 44b (ד\"ה חביט) understands this to mean \"waving,\" but Rambam (Hil. Lulav 7:22) says that it means \"beating,\" and says that it can be done \"on the ground or on a utensil\"; Rema (Orach Chaim 664:4), citing Tur, says that we do both - first wave it and then beat it.</p>\n\n<p>Kabbalistically, it should be beaten specifically on the ground (Zohar 3:32a). Mishnah Berurah (664:19) compromises: first beat it on the ground (five times, in keeping with a statement by Arizal), then continue beating it on a utensil to knock off the leaves.</p>\n\n<p>Reasons behind this practice: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&pgnum=370\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taamei Haminhagim</a> cites Tolaas Yaakov that it is \"to destroy the [severe] judgement so that it not be found, and bring it down to the dust so that it ceases to exist from the world.\" (In Kabbalistic writings they speak of the \"five severities,\" which is why Arizal says to use five aravah branches and to beat them five times.) In a footnote there he also cites Levush, that it is done as an expression of joy.</p>\n\n\n",

But you should not go out of your way to exempt yourself from a mitzva. If we're told \"it's a mitzva to do ABC\", then we should think proactively about trying to do ABC, not wheedling out of it. The diabetic needs to eat on Yom Kippur? We certainly understand. A healthy person who felt like going for a ten mile run, but boy now he's dehydrated and really needs a drink so he asks his rabbi? (I've read of this.) Well at this point his life comes first so he shouldn't fast. But why did he put himself there to begin with?</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara says that a person who takes his four-cornered garments and purposely goes and rounds the corners, to get out of the obligation to put tzitzit on them -- such a person, well, when G-d is angry, you don't want to be them.</p>\n\n<p>This was famously applied by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein with regards to taking trips for the fun of it on Chol HaMoed Sukkot. In theory, travelers aren't \"home\" and thus are exempt from eating in a Sukkah (\"treat it like your home\") -- so if I had to fly someplace over Sukkot (let's say I'm visiting family, or it's a business trip), fine I can eat bread or whatever on the plane. But to go say \"hey I'll go do a day trip to the amusement park, and oh woops, I'm traveling -- honey! Pack the salami sandwiches! Sukkah shmookah!\" is frowned-upon.</p>\n\n<p>This is different than opting to eat non-grain products at work on Sukkot -- first of all, you have to go to work and there's no Sukkah, you're not purposely avoiding the mitzvah. Secondly it's not an \"exemption\" if you eat non-grain, it's that the only obligation in the first place is on grain products. (Now if you tailor your menu for all of Sukkot to avoid all grain and thus all sukkah-eating, that's a different story.)</p>\n\n<p>The tefilin-on-chol-hamoed is again different; if your family practice says you should not wear tefilin then you shouldn't. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Intention matters... but so do the circumstances and the reason for the patur.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the Sukkah, we do not eat in the rain because it is unpleasant.  If you find eating in the rain during sukkot unpleasant, then you should not eat in the sukkah even if you aren't eating even when it isn't raining.  If, however, you normally don't eat in the Sukkah, and the rain inspires you to go ahead and do it (out of some desire for self sacrifice and it makes you feel good) then you should certainly take the opportunity to do Teshuva and eat in the sukkah in the Rain.  But of course you don't have to if it is indeed unpleasant for you.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the Tefilin, it makes no sense to not wear tefilin during Chol Hamoed if you don't wear it the rest of the year.  The Mishna says you wear Tefilin, and only for Kabalistic reasons, does it make sense to remove them for Chol Hamoed. Not wearing them during Chol Homoed is just a great opportunity for your Yetzer Harah to convince you to not do teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>Source: College Rabbi who dealt with this issue often.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I thought this was cute, the last line refers to not eating in the Sukkah in the rain.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jr.co.il/humor/sukkot01.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Seuss on Sukkot</a></p>\n\n<p>In terms of an answer about wither you get the mitzvah in the rain if you don't do the mitzvah when it is not raining:</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/talmud4/18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna</a> found here Sukka 18 - Daf 28b-29a tells us that we must view the Sukkah as a permanent home.

I don't see this in the Stone chumash or the Simanim tikkun. Simchat Torah never falls on Shabbat, so we don't ever read 7 aliyot for this parashah outside Israel. Even in Israel, my understanding (perhaps wrong) is that when Shemini Atzeret falls on Shabbat, the 7th aliyah is Chatan Bereishit. So why does Keter Yerushalayim show 7 aliyot for V'zot Habracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>My Simanim Tikkun does have seven aliyot marked in V'zot Habracha (the sixth starting at \"Meona\", and the seventh at \"Vaya'al Moshe\"), but perhaps this is because it is the Israeli version of the tikkun. All other tikkunim I've seen (in Israel) have seven aliyot as well.</p>\n\n<p>The custom I've seen, when Simchat Torah falls on shabbat, is to indeed add an extra aliyah before Chatan Torah (making Kol Hana'arim start from \"Meona\"). It really isn't necessary, as just the normal aliyot are seven+maftir anyway, and in any case, far more than seven aliyot are read; I think it is more of a way of marking the chag that falls on shabbat as special, to add another \"shabbat\" aliya, as we do on other holidays. I think I've also seen times when this wasn't done - mostly because the community wasn't sure what to do, and the custom isn't 100% clear. The Mishna Berura doesn't discuss this point, though it discusses Simchat Torah reading both inside and outside of Israel, and outside of Israel on shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Simchat Torah does fall on Shabbat in Eretz Yisrael from time to time.

I'm not sure how this plays out for \"<em>V'zos Hab'racha</em>\" specifically (since the \"week\" is more than seven days), though.</p>\n\n\n",

And the Torah does not clearly mention this because many plants, such as trees, did not require this. And therefore the Torah left out mention of it. Additionally, the style of the Torah is to mention some details and leave out some. And it mentioned the living creatures because they are more honorable than plants. And what seems most correct is to say that it is included in the Torah when it said \"it will be for you and for them to eat\", meaning to say that it necessarily follows from this that these seeds should suffice to provide sustenance from them for the living creatures in the ark and after leaving it, and this would be by planting them in the ground. For of what benefit would it be for them to have sustenance in the ark but not have sustenance once they leave the ark, and they would die? This idea is clearly invalidated, for if so saving them would be for naught and it wouldn't fulfill what God may He be exalted wanted to cause seed to live on the entire face of the earth. And this is why it is clear that it already necessarily follows from this that there must have remained from all the seeds to plant in the ground after leaving the ark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><strong>Does the Bible ever exaggerate?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why didn’t Noah save the plants? Well, Noah didn’t save the fish either. Needless to say, the fish would have survived the flood even though the Bible states that all creatures were corrupted upon the face of the earth. One way to interpret it is that the Bible always exaggerates to make a point. It obviously meant that most people were sinners and that the flood was of natural consequences, which is to say that people didn’t pay attention to the signs of the possibility of a flood and remained where they were. Acts have consequences that can have long-lasting effects even for generations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Was there a world wide flood?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, what of the plants? Now that we know that not every plant was corrupted and in need of eradicating, we can safely assume that not all were drowned. Indeed, the Bible doesn’t state that all plants drowned for a dove brought back a branch for Noah, indicating that land was nearby and that it was time to land. It is possible that the flood was a local event. This would explain why people and animals inhabited the world over before and after the flood. To support this claim I will quote Rabbi Marc Shapiro who says that it would be impossible to image a certain animal only inhabited to its region would have lived elsewhere, especially if the animal could not sustain in the region, not to mention the lack of evidence. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Now that we know the flood was local and that there was no need to kill all living things since it is not possible to imagine that everyone with the sole exception of one family were guilty. The Torah itself makes this very claim by citing the doves’ return to the boat with a branch, indicating that it was a local flood.</p>\n\n\n",

Some of the commentaries say that it means: don't answer the fool with invective of your own, because that will put you on his level, but do answer him in a way that will help him (or, at least, the audience) realize his lack of knowledge. (Ralbag, specifically, comments that it would be wrong to leave him with his mistaken notions; \"it is appropriate to remove stumbling blocks from people's way, [even] forcibly.\") So perhaps indeed this would require you to correct their scientific misconceptions, although perhaps one might argue that there's a difference between those that have practical and immediate repercussions vs. those that are more theoretical.</p>\n\n<p>(Also, most people aren't \"fools\" in the sense used here; Malbim points out that this term means someone who knows he's wrong but is trying to twist the truth in order to rationalize his improper behavior.)</p>\n\n\n",

I know the gemara does the same with cabbage and other fruit and vegetables like watercress and the like. What does the gemara wish to accomplish by giving this information if anything, what is the significance, and is there a significance to its placement to this information? Or is the gemara just plain old giving food and health advice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There might be a few possible reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It might indeed be \"plain old giving food and health advice\" - maintaining proper health is important in being able to serve Hashem without disruption, after all. Indeed, Rambam <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910344/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm\">begins</a> his recommendations for a healthy lifestyle (Hil. De'os ch. 4) with exactly this point: \"Since maintaining a healthy and sound body is among the ways of G-d - for one cannot understand or have any knowledge of the Creator, if he is ill - therefore, he must avoid that which harms the body and accustom himself to that which is healthful and helps the body become stronger.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>In particular, these statements and recommendations are of help to Torah scholars, helping them to make the best of their (usually limited) finances. We thus find in Shabbos 140b a whole series of \"smart consumer\" suggestions by Rav Chisda, all addressed specifically to the yeshivah student <em>(bar bei rav)</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sometimes these also shed light on other facts and statements. For example, in Pesachim 87b-88a Ulla says that one reason why Hashem arranged for the Jews to be exiled specifically to Babylonia was \"so that they could eat dates [which grow there abundantly] and be involved in Torah study.\" The list in Kesubos of the good qualities of dates, then, supplements this, and helps us understand better how they are indeed an ideal cheap and nourishing food.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is all on a simple peshat level. No doubt there are also deeper Kabbalistic and other reasons for this information being included in the Gemara, although I don't know of any.</p>\n\n\n",

In the Persian language, servitude and utilization is verbalized as imra'ah. From the commentary of R' Moshe Hadarshan I have learned this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Rashi is translating a word in Lashon Hakodesh (Biblical Hebrew) using a word in another language. How does he know that the word is the same, and it is not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_cognate\" rel=\"noreferrer\">false cognate</a>?</p>\n<p>Rashi does say (<a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/b02r.html#ch11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereshit 11:1</a>) that the original language was Lashon Hakodesh (Before G-d mixed up all the languages - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175/showrashi/true#v116\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereshit 11:6-9</a>), but that obviously doesn't mean that every word that sounds the same as a word in Lashon HaKodesh means the same thing.</p>\n<p>So the question remains, How does Rashi know that the words in a different language mean the same thing as the same words in Lashon HaKodesh?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The first thing to clarify is that Rashi is not making these connections on his own, they are sourced from his Rabbis, the Talmud, and other places.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to the word Totofot, which Rashi Devarim 6:8 says is made up of two words, one Kafti and one African (Rashi is quoting Midrash Tanchumah Bo 14, Sanhedrin 4B, Menachot 34B), the Chumash Shai LaMorah brings an explanation from the Be'er Mayim Chaim.</p>\n\n<p>He says that we're not learning Halacha from non-Lashon Kodesh words. Rather, the Rabbis had a tradition that these foreign words were really Lashon Kodesh words that had remained by the non-Jews from before G-d split up all the nations during the tower of Bavel, when all the nations still spoke Lashon Hakodesh.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/drasha/5758/bo.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torah.org/learning/drasha/5758/bo.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Talmud in Sanhedrin is concerned with the origins of the word\n  Totafos, clearly it has no Jewish origin. The Talmud declares that\n  Totafos is a compound word that combines two foreign words. The word\n  Tot in Afriki (I assume Africa) means two, and the word Pas in the\n  Coptic language means two. The Tefilin on the head has four\n  compartments. Thus, tat-pas or totafos, means four.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this I would conjecture that there are other words in the Torah that are foreign in nature. Rashi HaKodosh helped illuminate these difficult words.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I do not have a source for this answer, but here's my theory about this in any case:</p>\n\n<p>All words in the Torah (including 'Totafot') are in Lashon HaKodesh.</p>\n\n<p>The whole Torah is in Lashon HaKodesh... so why would there be foreign unholy words in the Torah??</p>\n\n<p>Ok, so why does Rashi say that the word is from Persian, Afriki, Aramaic, Greek or whatever??</p>\n\n<p>Well, I would say that originally the word in question was originally Lashon HaKodesh, but, at some time Jews stopped using that particular word (maybe because it was rarely used). As time passed the meaning of word became unclear to (most) Jews. </p>\n\n<p>So where does the Persion, Afriki come in??</p>\n\n<p>Well, until the tower of Babel incident, all humans spoke Lashon HaKodesh. Then, at Migdal Bavel, Hashem confused (BilBel = Babel) their languages. It seems that the meaning here is that Hashem scrambled the languages together somewhat (using Lashon HaKodesh as the base language) as apposed to inventing a new language for each nation. Notice the example that Rashi bring on Bershis 11:7 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One asked for a brick, and the other one passed him mortar</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>well, this seems to mean that the other guy <em>did sort of understand</em> the first guy, just that the word for brick in the first language became the word for mortar in the second. </p>\n\n<p>That's why we see that different langues are linked, and that's why we can say that ALL languages link back to Lashon HaKodesh.</p>\n\n<p>So, in cases where Rashi couldn't find any source for a word, Rashi presumed that the word was adopted (at Babel) by another language, and then - using the context of that word in the verse - Rashi looked through other languages to see if they have a word - with that meaning which looks like the word as it appears in the Torah. (unless some earlier source had already made the connection - like R Moshe HaDarshan)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where can I find examples of R. Yishmael's 13 talmudic rules?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We read Rabbi Yishmael's 13 principles of interpreting torah in the shacharit service and many of the explanations seem fairly straightforward, but I am not a very advanced student and I find I don't really know how some of them work.  The only ones I routinely, explicitly encounter with my chevruta seem to be kal v'chomer and gezeirah shava.  Presumably I'm encountering the others too but they aren't necessarily called out and I don't recognize them.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking for is a straighforward example of each -- an argument that uses <em>only</em> binyan av and one that uses <em>only</em> kelal u'perat and so on.  These should be \"clean\" examples, ones that most people would agree are good examplars of each technique.  Where can I find such examples?</p>\n\n<p>(For reference, here is <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Baraita_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\">the list</a> and <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Talmudical_Hermeneutics#Detailed_rules\">some explanations (not complete)</a> from Wikipedia.  Their external links seem to be broken so I can't tell if the two sources they cite would be helpful.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 23)\n\n<p>The Artscroll siddur has a short example on each one.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the examples given:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Kal Vachomer</strong> - If a lenient case has a stringency, a stringent case should have a stringency. An example would be if on Yom-Tov one cannot pick an apple (even though one can generally do <em>melachos</em> that involve food-preparations) all the more so on Shabbos.</li>\n<li><strong>Gzeira Shava</strong> - A <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=66&format=pdf\">tradition from Sinai</a> that two ideas are connected through one of two ways:\n<ul>\n<li>The same word appears two times in two different contexts, thereby connecting the two idea. An example would be in the Gmarah <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=66&format=text\">Psachim</a> which says that we learn the law that we bring the Pesach offering on Shabbos from the fact that we bring the daily Tomid even on Shabbos through the Gzierah Shava of the words \"Bmoado\" (It says \"Bmoado\" by <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0428.htm\">Tomid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0409.htm\">Pesach</a>). </li>\n<li>Two psukim next to each other (also called Hekesh). An example could be that the law that one could get married through a \"Shtar\" (contract) is derived from the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0524.htm\">verse</a> \"She left from his house, and became married to another\". Through this \"Hekesh\" we learn that \"leaving\" is compared to \"marrying\", and just like a divorce is done through a \"shtar\", so too could marrying.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Binyan Av</strong> - Also called \"Me Matzinu\", which means that a detail by law apply to other laws when it logically makes sense. An example would be the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=54b&format=text\">Gemarah Yevamos</a> which says that from the Torah's prohibition on marrying one's mother's half-sister and one's mother we derive that marrying one's father's half-sister is also prohibited. (If a mother's half-sister is considered like a mother's sister, than a father's half-sister should be like a father's sister).</li>\n<li><strong>Klal U'Prat</strong> - When a generality is followed by specific cases, only the cases are included in the rule. An example would be the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0301.htm\">verse</a>: \"...A person who brings an offering, you should bring it from the domesticated animals, from the cows and the sheep\". Therefore, one can only bring it from cows and sheep.</li>\n<li><strong>Prat U'Klal</strong> - When specific cases are followed by a generalization, the rule  applies by any case in  the generalization, and is not limited to the cases. An example would be that with regarding lost objects the verse <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0522.htm\">says</a>: \"So too you should do to his garment, so too you should do to his donkey, so too you should do to any lost object of your brother\". Therefore, one has to return all lost objects, and not just donkeys and garments.</li>\n<li><strong>Klal Uprat Uklal</strong> - When there is a general rule, followed by examples, followed by a general rule. The Halacha is that we follow the general rule, but only on condition it is similar to the specific case. An example would be in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=57b&format=text\">Bava Metziya</a> where the Gemara is discussing when a thief must pay back double. The Gemarah brings a <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0222.htm\">verse</a> which says that \"On any trespass, on the ox, on the donkey, on the sheep, on the garment, on any lost item...\". \"On any trespass\" is one generalization, \"on the ox...garment\" are the detailed cases, and \"on any lost item\" is another generalization. Therefore, one must pay back double on any item similar to the middle items, that is something that has inherent monetary worth and isn't land.</li>\n<li><strong>Klal Shehu Tzrich Liprat</strong> - Sometimes the specific case is necessary to clarify the general rule. An example is the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0317.htm\">verse</a> which says: \"You shall cover it with dirt\". The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=88b&format=text\">Gemarah</a> says that at first glance, this verse is a classic example of \"A general rule followed by a specific case\" (\"You shall cover it\" is the general, while \"with dirt\" is the specific case). However, \"with dirt\" is needed to explain HOW to cover it (i.e. that the dirt must be capable of being planted with, not salty earth).</li>\n<li><strong>Kol davar shehaya bichlal...</strong> - An example would be: the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0307.htm\">verse</a> says: \"Whatever remains from any sacrifice on the third day shall be burned in fire\" and the next verse says: \"If anyone eats from the Shlamim sacrifice on the third day... the one that eats it shall bear his inquity (gets Kares)\". This rule teaches that one who eats not only nosar-shlamim sacrifices gets Kares but anyone who eats Nosar gets Kares.</li>\n<li><strong>Vyatzo Liton...Kinyano...</strong> - An example: the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0324.htm\">verse</a> says that one who kills someone is executed (no differentiation between careless or premeditated murder).  When the Torah later on refers to the punishment of exile for a careless murderer, it cannot be adding to execution, but to replace it with exile.</li>\n<li><strong>Veyetze Liton...Shelo Kinyano...</strong> - These <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0221.htm\">verses</a> describe how Jewish male-servants go free. According to logic the laws of the female slave should be the same. However, because it says by a female servant \"She should not go out like men-servants\", females could go out before six years. However, it is also more stringent, as the master could betroth her against her will.</li>\n<li><strong>Veyatza Lidon</strong> - <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0322.htm\">A Kohen</a> who married an Israelite is not permitted to eat Trumah. If she becomes divorced or widowed she would not be able to eat Trumah unless the Torah returned her back to the family group.</li>\n<li><p>There are two rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Davar Halamed Minyano</strong> - It says in the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0220.htm\">Ten Commandments</a> \"Do not steal\". The sages say it must refer to kidnapping because the two commandment before (Don't commit adultery and Don't kill) are capital crimes. The only capital form of stealing is kidnapping.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Davar Halamed Misofo</strong> - When the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0314.htm\">Torah</a> refers to \"leprosy\" on houses, it says that a house with a \"leprous\" spot must be torn down (it doesn't say which house). From the end of the subject (when it talks about how to clean houses of wood, mortar and stone) we see that leprosy on houses only applies to wood, mortar and stone houses.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Shnei Ksuvim</strong> - In one <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0121.htm\">verse</a> it says that Avraham's progeny will stem from Yitzchak, while <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0122.htm\">later</a> Hashem says to offer Yitzchak as a burned offering. Therefore, Hashem explained that Hashem didn't want Avraham to offer Yitzchak as a burned offering, rather he was supposed to just \"bring him up\". Therefore, there is no contradiction.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I don't know where you can find it in English, but if your question is where can you find good, clean examples that everyone can agree about, I think by far the most authoritative place to look is in the original source of the 13 rules.

I really don't know: So, do these copyrights only apply to the layout and typography, or is there any real basis to them?

For example, if you want to publish a sefer you cannot just grab the text from the Bar Ilan disk, since they put much effort into correcting the mistakes and expanding the abbreviations, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, a publisher is just copying an old text without improving it at all, obviously they have no special claim to it. All they would be able to copyright is the typography etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Actually, there's a great deal more to copyright than just protecting the author's creative contributions or additions. <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/halacha/schneider_1.htm\">This</a> article by Rabbi Israel Schneider, <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/1762\">this</a> article by Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.torahlive.co.il%2Ftemplatebild%2Ftipsresources%2FHalacha%2520and%2520Copyright%2520(Jachter).pdf&ei=dAACUIW1F6aQiQfqzaGcDQ&usg=AFQjCNGARFgpYFg9syuaNwai8ahlzVL9FQ&sig2=8iE1TMHZHl3mhLTebIg3PA\">this</a> PDF by Rabbi Chaim Jachter all provide a nice overview of the different means by which rabbis have traditionally framed the problem. To give a brief example here:</p>\n\n<p>The very first case of Jewish copyright infringement occurred in the middle of the 16th century (only one hundred years after Gutenberg introduced movable type printing to Europe!), when Rabbi Meir Katzenellenbogan (the \"Maharam\" of Padua) produced a new edition of the Rambam's Mishne Torah. Almost immediately, a rival publisher (a non-Jew named Marcantonio Justinian) printed another edition of the same text and made it slightly cheaper. The Maharam had not <i>composed</i> the Mishne Torah, nor had he composed any commentaries to go with it, and Justinian had not utilised the Maharam's type-set. Nonetheless, it was still deemed to be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Isserles (the Rema) placed a retrospective <i>herem</i> upon anybody who purchased the cheaper version, argued that doing what Justinian did constituted an infringement of <i>hasagat gevul</i>, and mandated that all future Jewish books receive <i>haskamot</i> that make the nature of this ban clear. In later years, Rabbi Moshe Sofer (the Chatam Sofer) was to disagree with the notion of a retrospective ban, but acknowledged the need for this type of copyright protection: if you do not guard the interests of publishers, nobody will take upon themselves the financial risk of publishing a Jewish book, and Jewish books will all disappear.</p>\n\n<p>There are other interesting cases discussed in the three articles to which I linked above, including one that involved a publication of the Shulchan Arukh together with a commentary that was <i>not</i> in the public domain, and one that involved a ruling of Rabbi Yehezkel Landau (the Noda BiYehuda) on a case that involved the publisher extorting the author. On each of these issues, there is more than one way to understand the basis of the halakha, and interested parties should look into them for themselves.</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, while the Chazon Ish ruled that completing a circuit may be \"boneh\" [completing] in an electronic device there may be no visible physical change as the switching is taking place within the electronics.  Also, modulating a current may be less of a problem as you are not completing a circuit.  In that regard a touch screen may be less problematic than a keyboard.  Causing the voice device, or another device which it controls, to respond by your voice commands is another issue.  None of this is cut and dried and there are differing opinions.  There are technologically savvy Rabbis to ask. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am no \"posek\" but according to the Chazon Ish the operation of electrical equipment is a melacha of Boneh and so it is prohibited from the Torah.\nThis means that operating the equipment the \"usual\" way (e.g. the way it was designed to be operated) would be prohibited. This is regardless of which part of your body you are using.\nSo I guess that if something has been designed to be voice operated it would be not allowed in Shabath.\nBut, if you do something unusual (\"shinui\") it maybe prohibited only by Rabanan.\nFor example (excuse me for the example) spitting on a touch screen instead of touching it. Nobody does something like that which make it into a \"shinui\".\nBut, again, I am no posek.</p>\n\n\n",

There are two aspects here: The fact that you are causing the oven to operate, and the pressing of the buttons that provide information to the oven's computer. Rav Heinemann has a teshuva (<a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/pdf/oventeshuva.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>) explaining his reasons for permitting this. Very briefly, the causation aspect is not an issue because this kind of Gramma is allowed on Yom Tov; and the button pressing is okay because there is no visible effect, and the Torah does not forbid things that are undetectable to humans. (See there for why this would not apply to computers and recording devices etc.)</p>\n\n<p>However, many other poskim -- notably, Rav Shlomo Miller and numerous authorities in Eretz Yisrael -- reject this position (I think mainly due to the second aspect mentioned above).

I recall seeing them advertised in the Jewish newspapers.</p>\n\n<p>How do they work, in terms of being ok on Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=199&ArticleID=55\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zomet</a>, the idea is similar to having a track which a ball is rolled down once a minute.  Touching the ball would (in this analogy) be work, but moving a lever that changed a gate so that the next ball (whenever it comes) would roll down a different path is gramma and thus acceptable.  Moving that lever is not in-and-of-itself work, does not make anything else happen, and does not set off a chain of events.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, what happens with the scooters (at least <a href=\"http://www.shabbatscooter.com/p/how-shabbat-amigo-works.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these</a> scooters) is that every so often it checks to see if the \"forward\" lever is pressed (dropping the ball).  If it is (the gate's been moved), it starts forward very slowly.  To stop it, you turn it so that the front wheel acts as a brake (it's perpendicular to the direction of motion), and there isn't enough power to move it.  There's also an emergency stop lever, which you can use if you're in a life-threatening situation and need to stop <strong>now</strong> (permissible as Pikuach Nefesh).  </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Basically the scooter works in the following way.\nThere is a constant flow and command from the computer to the motor to go in a specific direction.  Normally, you would set it up so that when you move the controls on a scooter, it sends a message to the computer, which sends a message to the motor to change directions. However, on a \"kosher scooter\", moving the controls moves a physical barrier which alters  which sensor gets the next flow of electricity.  This sensor, then tells the computer to tell the motor to change direction. The fact that it is the \"next flow\" and not the current circuit is important in making it \"OK\" for shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Remember however, that these things are only approved for very specific circumstances.</p>\n\n\n",

An example would be that with regarding lost objects the verse says: \"So too you should do to his garment, so too you should do to his donkey, so too you should do to any lost object of your brother\". Therefore, one has to return all lost objects, and not just donkeys and garments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to suggest that the specifics are not actually necessary; the torah could have just given us the general law (\"you should do to any lost object of your brother\", in this case).  But I was taught that there are no unnecessary words in torah.  So what purpose do the specific cases serve?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Because the specific cases do teach us something about the scope of the general statement.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, the Mishnah (Bava Metzia 27a) points out that a garment has unique identifying marks <em>(simanim)</em> and an owner who is looking for it <em>(tov'im)</em>, and that this therefore delimits \"any lost object of your brother\": it has to be returned only if it has these two features. Which means, for example, that a mass-produced item that has no identifying marks, like a coin, need not be returned even if someone is claiming it; conversely, an item with such a mark, if you know that the owner has given up hope of finding it, needn't be returned either.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally, this is an example of <em>binyan av</em>, the third of the 13 principles: a specific example serves as a paradigm for other, similar, cases. As Shmuel Brill pointed out in his comment to that question, the Gemara often uses this device without mentioning it by name.)</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (ibid.) goes on to point out that the Torah's mention of a donkey teaches us that, since a donkey and its saddle always go together (saddles are made to measure for each individual animal), then if you find a saddled donkey, and the owner is unable to provide a <em>siman</em> for the donkey but is able to identify the saddle, then you have to return both.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is aside from the non-literal levels of meaning in the Torah. Again using this example, the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l, in one of his talks (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15859&pgnum=171\">Likkutei Sichos, vol. 1, p. 157</a>) explains that each of the four specific lost objects that the Torah mentions (there are also an ox and a sheep mentioned two verses earlier) represent four types of people who have \"lost their way\" in serving G-d, each failing in a different aspect, but all of whom can be \"returned\" to Him through <em>teshuvah</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, then, Noach was concerned about his own righteousness and that of his immediate family, but not so much about everyone else.</p>\n\n<p>[It is true that, as the Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3825&size=1\">Sanhedrin 108a</a>) and other sources note, that Noach did reprove them throughout the 120 years that he spent building the ark. However, the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l explains (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16037&pgnum=53\">Likkutei Sichos, vol. 15, pp. 40</a>-41) that he did so not out of real concern for them, but simply because G-d had commanded him to do so.]</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Zohar (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14353&pgnum=143\">1:67b</a>-68a) cites a discussion between R. Yitzchak and R. Yehudah on this point. R. Yitzchak indeed contrasts Noach unfavorably with Moshe, who prayed for his generation and averted Hashem's wrath against them; R. Yehudah counters that even Moshe was unable to find sufficient merit among his contemporaries, and had to appeal to the merit of the Avos - who of course hadn't yet been born in Noach's time. In another of his talks (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16051&pgnum=34\">Likkutei Sichos, vol. 25, pp. 21</a>-22), the Rebbe notes that R. Yitzchak is not actually faulting Noach for his inaction, since indeed he was laboring under the constraint that R. Yehudah mentions as well as several others described in the Zohar there; he is simply pointing out that we should not use him as a role model.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<h2>One Answer</h2>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/ti/5758/noach58.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Insights for Shabbat Parshat Noach 5758</a> by Rabbi Aaron Borow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ki Tov answers.

Therefore he did not pray for mercy on their behalf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Noach was unable to pray on behalf of his generation, because such an act would express a feeling of connection and concern. Precisely because Noach was not a greatly righteous man, but only righteous \"in relation to his generation,\" he was concerned that pleading for mercy for them would lead to a blurring of the distinction between him and the rest of his generation.</p>\n<p>In order to pray for another person, one must understand his tragedy. To be able to pray for his generation, Noach would have had to understand them, and argue before God that their deeds should be pardoned in consideration of the circumstances that brought them to do what they did. It was this that Noach feared. If you really understand someone, doubts may arise within you - perhaps that other person is really right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(this is similar to Monica's comment)</p>\n\n\n",

If he would not have brought them into the Ark they would all have perished, so they owed their life to him. If so, why is he allowed to eat fish and not be like Adam who the <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3728&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Sanhedrin 59b</a> says was not allowed to eat it?

I can recall a few.\nRav Chaim Kanievsky  (some others as well) answer that once the issur of eating animals went off, so did the issur on fish because it was one issur.\n2. Adam was never forbidden to eat fish.\n3. Noach saved the fish as well. Since by the Teiva the water was cool.\n4. Avnei Nezer says that really fish didn't become permissible to eat after the mabul. They only became permitted at Har Sinai when Jews got the laws of kosher fish. Some add that fish became permitted then because if the Jews wouldn't accept the Torah the world would've got destroyed, therefore they saved the fish. The Avnei Nezer adds that's why there's a custom to eat fish on Shabbos because that's when the Torah was given. This answer is also brought in the Pardes Yosef.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Noach's upkeep of the animals merited that he could eat from them afterwards.

He brings a gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=108b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 108b</a>) stating that the waters of the Mabul were boiling and should have killed the fish as well. He offers 2 answers to why they weren't killed, both along the lines of the fish fleeing to cooler waters in the depths and elsewhere. This perhaps strengthens the question above.</p>\n\n<p>I heard an answer (source?) that the Ark provided cool waters so that the fish could survive. This would explain why Noach would be allowed to eat fish as well; they were directly saved by him and his ark. The fish were in a sense 'saved by the Ark' as much as the animals were, thus permitting him to eat from them as well.</p>\n\n\n",

He is also crying, and if they press the unfairness and awfulness of this, which indeed it is unfair and awful -- yet must be done for the purpose of the Divine Plan -- then He will agree and decide that the maintenance of the world is not worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, angels do what Hashem tell them to.

It would seem the following verses tell a different story:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0110.htm#14\">Bereshit 10:14</a> as <a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/b02r.html#fn268\">interpreted by Rashi</a> (based on Midrash Rabbah) says that the Plishtim descended from Cham via his son Mitzrayim (not the Greeks who are descended from Yafet, and not from Mitzrayim's son Kaftor):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Verse 14: [Also] the Pasrusim, and the Kasluchim from whom came the Plishtim.</strong>     They descended from both of them. For the Pasrusim and the Kasluchim would exchange wives with each other and the Plishtim [Philistines] descended from them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this discussed anywhere? Are all the references to the Plishtim in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0126.htm\">Bereshit 26</a> to Avimelech, king of the Plishtim <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Proleptic\">proleptic</a>? What about the reference in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0213.htm#17\">Shemot 13:17</a>? </p>\n\n<p>According to Judaism, did the Plishtim always live in Canaan/Israel, or did they only show up later?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In several places in Tanach, the Philistines are mentioned as having come from Caphtor (for example, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1147.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jer. 47:4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1509.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amos 9:7</a>) - and in our verse, too, the Philistines and the Caphtorim are closely related.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0502.htm#23\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 2:23</a> the Torah states that the Caphtorim destroyed \"the Avites who lived in unfortified villages as far as Gaza,\" and <a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/d01r.html#fn209\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi there</a> points out that this made their land available for Jewish conquest (since the Avites were protected by the treaties that Avraham and Yitzchak had made with successive Avimelechs).</p>\n\n<p>It's uncertain where Caphtor is. R. Aryeh Kaplan zt\"l <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=10\" rel=\"nofollow\">cites</a> sources that it might be either an area in modern Turkey or in Egypt. I've also seen people who identify it as one of the Mediterranean islands, which would fit well with them being proto-Greek at least culturally even if not ethnically. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2102.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zeph. 2:5</a> also calls the Philistines \"the nation of Kereithim\" - a possible reference to Crete.)</p>\n\n<p>All in all, then, it seems that the original Philistine people were conquered and largely replaced by invaders who ended up taking the same ethnonym for themselves. (So the references to them in the Torah aren't proleptic, but they do refer to a different people than the ones in the later books of Tanach.) The remnants of the original people came to be called Avites (as in the verse from Deuteronomy cited above, and also in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0613.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Josh. 13:3</a>, which starts by mentioning \"the five Philistine officials\" but then lists the Avim as number six) or Jebusites (as in Josh. 15:63 and II Sam. 5:6, see Rashi in both places). That the Torah distinguishes carefully between the original Philistines and their successors is also evident from the differences in geography and political organization: the ones from Avraham and Yitzchak's time had one king with his capital at Gerar, which afterwards is never mentioned; the later Philistines had a decentralized system of five chiefs <em>(seranim)</em> in each of their five major cities.</p>\n\n\n",

Is one allowed to tell a friend when he sees one, in order to allow him to make a Bracha or should he hold back as it is a bad sign?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Per Mishna Brura (229:1), when one sees a rainbow he should not inform a friend about it, but rather make a bracha and keep it to himself. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>As noted by Gershon, this is Mishnah Berurah citing the Chayei Adam. It seems that there might be room for manipulation according to other posekim. <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/Myers/QA-December.htm\">Thus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q. (252) Mr. Danny Persoff: Is there an Issur to look at a rainbow?\n  A. The Shulchan Aruch (229:1) writes that it is prohibited to look at a rainbow \"B'yotair\" for a prolonged period of time. The Gra (ibid.) writes that there is no prohibition of R'eeyah, briefly looking, for one needs to see the rainbow in order to make the Bracha; rather, the Issur is Histaklut, staring intently. (See also Machazit Hashekel ibid.) The Iyun Yaakov writes that it is a Mitzvah to see the rainbow in order to recite the Bracha. However, the Mishna Berura (229:1) quotes the Chayai Adam who maintains that one should not tell a friend that there is a rainbow in the sky.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding the reason for the Issur, the Gemara (Baizah 16a) writes that the rainbow symbolizes the glory of Hashem, therefore, it is inappropriate to look at the rainbow just as it would be wrong to look at the glory of Hashem, K'veyachol. (See Shmot 24:10-11 regarding B'nai Yisrael looking at Elokai Yisrael.) The Tosfot Harid explains the comparison between a Keshet and Hashem: Just like the colors of a rainbow are indiscernible, one can not tell where one color ends and another begins, so too with regard to Hashem, we can not truly know Him, and we must symbolize that ignorance by abstaining from staring at the rainbow. (See the M'eeri Baizah16a, where he writes that the Issur is not to stare at the rainbow, rather, to delve into the mysteries of the Pesukim that deal with the rainbow in Parshat Noach.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For instance, the Aruch HaShulchan, which some people pasken like over the Mishnah Berurah, writes <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=418\">in the same siman, 229</a> that the prohibition is just <strong>staring</strong>, not simply looking. And he does not cite the Chayei Adam about not telling a friend, and so does not bring it down lehalachah. This might well make sense, since you would not be causing your friend to violate any issur, if you are just telling him so that he can make the beracha.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, consult your local Orthodox rabbi, who will in all likelihood tell you to follow the Mishnah Berurah. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Kohen of Gerba Tunisia writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8751&st=&pgnum=199&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bris Kehuna Ma'areches Kuf, Ois Daled</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קשת. המנהג פשוט פה דכל מי שרואה הקשת אומר לחבירו או\n   לחביריו לברך על זה ומ״ש ה׳ כף החיים ז״ל סי׳ רכ״ט\n   אות א׳ בשם הה״א והא״ח דאין להגיד לחבירו שיש קשת משום\n   מוציא דבה. לע״ד אינו נראה דאדרבא אנחנו שמתים ונותנים תודה\n   וברכה לה׳ אשר בחסדו כרת הברית הזאת שלא להשתית את עולמו\n   עוד וכ״ן דעת רבותינו בגמרא ובפוסקים ודעת הראשונים שתיקנו\n   ברכה זו. ועוד דאדרבא טפי עדיף להגיד לזולתו כדי שכל אחד\n   הרואה ואחד השומע ישימו לב לשוב אל ה׳. כי בראותם כזאת יכירו\n   וידעו כי העולם כולו במצב קשה ונורא לולי רהמיו והםדיו ברוך\n   הוא. ולכן לע״ד יפה נהגו פה להגיד:</p>\n  \n  <p>The minhag pashut (common custom) is to tell someone else about the rainbow. That which the Kaf Hachaim and others say that it is like telling bad things, I don't agree with. It's the opposite; we are thanking Hashem for keeping us alive and not punishing us like we deserve. Also, seeing the rainbow brings persons to tshuva when they realise what a bad position the world is. Therefore it's correct for people to tell others. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I personally would say slightly different. If Hashem didn't want everyone to know about the rainbow, why show it just to a select few? Is it they who are the bad people and have to mend their ways while the others who don't see it themselves are all tsadikim and have no tshuva to do? </p>\n\n\n",

(So too Rav Acha in <a href=\"http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/b/r/r4204_015a.htm\">Yerushalmi Bava Metzia</a>.) Since the pasuk mentioned chamas, rather than gezel, it is a midrashic approach to look at the halachic definition of a chamsan.</p>\n\n<p>The courts back then, presumably, did not work according to the halacha. And so they did this in order to evade their courts, taking action just like a modern-day halachic 'chamsan'.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although this is speculation, you are talking about a Midrash explaining why the Dor HaMabul deserved the flood. Post-Mabul Bnei Noaḥ - by definition - have different rules than the Bnei Adam who lived prior to (and were punished by) the Mabul. Prior to the Mabul, perhaps, their courts had a Perutah requirement - or perhaps the Midrash is just using that terminology to explain just how corrupt and despicable the Dor HaMabul was. That, essentially (though perhaps not literally), they used every loophole they could think of to be within the law but outside the bounds of morality or simple human decency and therefore deserved to be punished and wiped out.  Bnei Noaḥ then, perhaps, were given a stricter set of rules than they otherwise should have needed, either as punishment or as preventive measure against future corruption (or both).  The Midrash does not have to be historically accurate with regard to how the courts generally worked in the days of the Dor HaMabul.  On the other hand, it could even be that the Midrash has a Mesorah about one such case in which this happened, and it's pointing to that as a demonstration as to just how low they had gone to maintain the non-culpability with their behavior.</p>\n\n<p>But in any case, I think the points made by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10927/ben-noach-stealing-less-then-a-perutah/10935#10935\">Josh Waxman</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10927/ben-noach-stealing-less-then-a-perutah/10929#10929\">Reb Haim</a> shed some light on this from a textual/Halachic standpoint.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not convinced that the courts at that time used Bnei Yisrael's system of Halachah with regard to determining the minimum amount of money for which a thief is liable, though I remain open to that possibility.  I am, however, fairly certain that the Midrash is using the example of deliberate less-than-Perutah theft to show how evil they were (because you must agree that this is evil) OR to make a point (you may not think this is evil, but see what happens if you employ this type of tactic!).</p>\n\n\n",

What in the world does he mean?</p>\n\n<p>Its in the first column first paragraph...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>He is saying that the year 3724 coincides with the end of a 532-year calendrical cycle. This cycle is when the 19-year <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Leap_months\" rel=\"noreferrer\">machzor katan</a> and the 28-year <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkat_Hachama\" rel=\"noreferrer\">machzor gadol</a> return to their initial positions (19 x 28 = 532). The year 3724 comes after exactly 7 of those cycles (532 x 7 = 3724). He does not explain why this has any significance.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Mevaqesh's comment spurred me to investigate further into the meaning of this cryptic statement, and I think I've ב\"ה gotten to the bottom of it. Seder Hadoros is quoting the medieval work Tzemach Dovid, which at its source <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42456&pgnum=28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">states</a> that the author found the following short rhyme in an ancient manuscript:</p>\n<p>בשנת ג' אלפים תשכ\"ד הנוצרי נלכד, ובשנת תקל\"ב בעץ נצלב</p>\n<p>(Roughly: In the year 3724 the Nazarene was captured, and in the year 532 he was hanged.)</p>\n<p>At first glance this doesn't seem to make sense, because the year 532 (or even 3532) is earlier than 3724. He therefore explains that \"532\" doesn't refer to the actual year, but rather describes the occurrence in terms of the calendrical cycle. In actuality, both events happened in the same year, which was 3724 from creation, and also came at the end of a full 532-year cycle (as explained above). By using these figures, each half of the sentence rhymes an event with the number that describes when it occurred. (תשכ\"ד - נלכד, תקל\"ב - נצלב).</p>\n<p>[It still seems very strange - what was the point of all this? My hunch is that it had nothing to do with Jesus per se, but was simply a mnemonic device to assist the people of that time in making the calculations relating to the Jewish calendar. When doing these calculations, it is much easier to start reckoning from a recent year that began a new cycle, instead of having to start at year zero. Since 3724 was a year that coincided with the beginning of both the machzor katan and the machzor gadol, that was a convenient year to use as a starting point. In later generations one could just keep adding 532 to get to the next such years (e.g. 4256, 4788...). To help remember these two numbers, someone came up with a witty rhyme that would stick in people's minds.]</p>\n<p>Getting back to Seder Hadoros, there is evidently some censorship and / or printing error: Instead of נלכד (captured) it says נולד (born), and instead of נצלב (hanged) it says וחי עד (and lived until), which basically makes the whole thing incomprehensible. Interestingly, I found a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36906&pgnum=98&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">different edition</a> of Tzemach Dovid in which a few critical lines are missing, clearly due to censorship issues.</p>\n\n\n",

Does a lack of such a marking indicate that the product is truly pareve?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if I have a product in my hand that has no dairy indication, may I safely eat it with meat, without having to refer to the ingredients panel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I asked this question of the OU when I was beginning to keep kosher -- if it just had an \"OU\" and not a \"D\" could I assume it was parve?  Their answer was yes.  They of course didn't speak for anybody else, but I got the impression that this was normative then and, since then, I haven't seen a case that didn't fit (other than printing errors!).  So \"D\" is dairy, \"M\" is meat, \"P\" might be \"Pesach\" (I saw that on a meat package once and was confused), but the absence of any such designation means parve with the hechshers I've seen (which is mainly the major ones, not the small local ones).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The OU has 4 variations of its heksher. OU-D is for dairy. OU-M (or OU-Meat) is meat. OU-P is passover, and plain OU is parve. A few other hekshers will spell it out when their product is parve, but the general rule is that if the product has a heksher without a special designation, then the product is parve. I've never seen a product where the lack of a special designation meant the product was dairy or meat.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a heksher like the OU without a designation, you don't need to check the ingredients list to determine whether it's really parve. In fact there are lots of reasons why you probably can't tell whether a product is dairy from the ingredients list, so you should trust the heksher. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ingredients that you've never heard of that happen to be dairy (it would take a long time for you to build up a knowledge base that allowed you to recognize ingredients like caesin as dairy.)</li>\n<li>when a product is made with utensils that have previously been used for dairy and not kashered. (Halachically this a bit different from dairy food, but you need to recognize this case as well, and know the appropriate laws about separating parve food cooked on dairy equipment from meat.) </li>\n<li>I've heard that manufacturers are allowed to omit ingredients form the list if they appear in insignificant amounts (but I've never tried to find the relevant law to verify this).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although most reliable Hechsherim write dairy or Chalavi on a dairy product, it is always a good idea to verify by looking at the ingredients. </p>\n\n\n",

So why didn't Avraham daven for the merit of nine people?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Chumash Shai LeMorah brings the Be'er Mayim Chaim (A commentary on Rashi written by the Maharal of Prague's brother, <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/netzavim.html\">R' Chaim of Friedberg</a>) says that once G-d agreed to save the 5 cities if there were 45 righteous people, Avraham understood that G-d was willing to be complete the quorum in order to save the city. (as <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v28\">Rashi 18:28</a> explains).</p>\n\n<p>Once Avraham understood this, when he asked G-d to spare 3 cities in the merit of 30 righteous people (2 for the sake of 20, etc.) (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v29\">Rashi 18:29</a>), he was asking G-d to save 3 cities even if there were only 27 righteous individuals, relying on G-d to complete the quorum in each of the 3 cities.</p>\n\n<p>So when Avraham was asking G-d to save 1 city if there were 10 righteous people to be found, he was asking G-d to save the city even if there were only 9 righteous people in the city, with G-d Himself counted as the 10th. (Of course, if there would be 10 without counting G-d, that would work too)</p>\n\n<p>Now we can understand why <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v32\">Rashi jumps from 10 people to 8 people</a>, since asking 10 was also asking 9. This also clarifies why Avraham went from 50 to 45, but went from 40 to 30 to 20 to 10, since 40 includes 36, etc. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rashi points out G-d had already told Avraham that He would save all five cities if there were 45 righteous people. Hence Avraham knew that one city could be saved by nine righteous people, so there was no need to ask G-d. And because of Noah, he knew that eight wasn't enough even if they were there, so he stopped asking.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>When Avraham asked for 45 tsadikim, he meant for nine tsadikim by krachim and Hachem associates to them to have 10 people. Since this ask has not been agreed, Avraham understood that there is no 9 tsadikim in order to save even one krach. See Sifte h'achamim on Rachi.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you become \"more tamei\"? If not, why do we worry about it today?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Without the temple and access to the ritual of the red heifer, we're all tamei (ritually impure) today with no way to fix it.  Yet we work to avoid situations that would make us tamei (e.g. kohanim still don't go near most dead, aside from close relatives).  Why is this?  Can one become \"more\" tamei with each exposure?  Or does it not have anything to do with our state but, rather, is about not developing bad habits that will be hard to break when we <em>do</em> have a third temple?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/725565/Rabbi_Aharon_Kahn/cohanim_b%27zman_hazeh\">this mp3 by Rabbi Aharon Kahn</a>, <a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2011/10/audio-roundup-8/\">summarized by Joel Rich here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once a Kohain is ritually impure due to contact with dead, is there any prohibition of further impurity? This makes a difference for med students and pulpit rabbis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The simple understanding is that for non-Kohens, yes we're all tamei so it makes no difference. You want to live in your own special chamber on Jerusalem bedrock, that's fine; you want to be an undertaker, that's fine too.</p>\n\n<p>For Kohens, the prohibition appears to be (and again there may be other opinions, but appears to be): don't come in contact with the dead in any way that could make you <em>tamei</em>. Even if the Kohen just touched corpse #1, he shouldn't touch corpse #2, as each touch is the kind that could make him <em>tamei</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Even for a Kohen, there's no prohibition whatsoever at becoming <em>tamei</em> via lesser sources, such as dead lizards. A Kohen today can touch as many dead lizards as he likes. </p>\n\n<p>(As the story goes, Professor Saul Lieberman once found a thousand-year-old manuscript from someone claiming a Kohen was prohibited to touch dead lizards too; to which Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik responded: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"so what do you think of Professor Jacob Aegis' work?\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lieberman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Aegis?! He's a fool! A nincompoop!

Thus if a kohein would touch a corpse one day, to touch one the next day would be to increase his levels of tumah because he restarts his 7 day count.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, one who is in contact with a corpse is on a higher level of tumah than one who had touched one. This rule is called \"cherev ke-chalal\" and is analyzed in the first perek of the Mishnayot in Ahilot. Basically it means while you are touching you become an extension of the corpse such that anything you are touching (for instance, your clothes) become tamei to the first degree, as opposed to second degree, even though they themselves aren't touching the corpse! Thus a kohein who touched a corpse and let go, would be adding to his level of tumah by touching it again.</p>\n\n<p>It is thus very reasonable to argue that a kohein who is currently touching a corpse has no obligation to let go, as he is not raising his tumah level -- it is already risen.</p>\n\n<p>One could discuss whether touching the corpse for a full day is a violation of adding to the 7 days, as above. This is a matter unresolved in the Achronim.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an excellent post on the issue: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032629/http://www.the-daf.com/talmud-conceptual/kohanim-becoming-tamei-nowadays-whats-the-story/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohanim becoming Tamei Nowadays – What’s the Story?</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are many types of unrelated and potentially overlapping Tumah, as well as different degrees of Tumah. Assuming you are talking repeat exposures to the same degree of Tumath Meth:</p>\n\n<p>You can't, and we don't. Kohanim are prohibited from an action that carries a consequence of Tumah, regardless of whether the consequence is in force, which could make it seem otherwise (ie., that you can become more Tamei and we care).</p>\n\n\n",

The same people that do not say baruch hu... do not say those psukim that some people say, but do say yehi rotzon by singing. The reason is that nobody is yotzai with the brocha... it is just on them. However, Halocha forbids to be mafsik if the kohanim are in middle. Some are therefore more careful, but when they are singing thay aren't saying any words.

    "content": "# New date at sunset: question on Sifse Chachamim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=4025&size=1\"><em>Avoda Zara</em> 25</a> cites a difference of opinion as to how long <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/T0610\">the sun stood still for <em>Y'hoshua</em></a>: twelve hours, twenty-four, or thirty-six. According to those who say twelve or thirty-six, the sun finally set at a time (on watches, if you will, or hourglasses) that was twelve hours after the hourglasses indicated \"sunset\". And the <em>next</em> time the hourglasses indicated \"sunset\", it was astronomical morning, around sunrise or so. Likewise for every subsequent day, until now: any hourglass or watch that has been set in place since the time of <em>Y'hoshua</em> and not adjusted since would indicate \"sunset\" every morning. Yet we indicate the start of a new calendar date at sunset, not in the morning. Thus, dates start not when the sun \"should\" set but when it does: a new date does not start until the sun actually sets, even if (as in <em>Y'hoshua</em>'s case) it \"should\" set earlier than that.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14004&pgnum=64\"><em>Sifse Chachamim</em> to <em>Noach</em> 8:22</a> says that, for the duration of the <em>mabul</em> (deluge), the sun and other orbs stood still, not moving in the sky: they remained, for the whole <em>mabul</em>, wherever they were at the start of the <em>mabul</em>, and there was no sunset. According to the paragraph above, then, the date should not have changed throughout the <em>mabul</em>. Yet the <em>p'sukim</em> (e.g., <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/T0108\">8</a>:4–5) clearly refer to the passage of dates. What's going on?</p>\n\n<p>(This is a question on the <em>Sifse Chachamim</em>. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14004&pgnum=63\">The <em>R'em</em></a>, for example, has a wholly different explanation of what occurred during the <em>mabul</em>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19148&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maskil LeDavid on Bereshit 8:22</a> says that even though the sun did not rise or set Noach had signs to recognize and distinguish between day and night, since he needed to know this for many reasons. Also, not all the animals ate at the same time, and Noach needed to know when to feed the animals.</p>\n\n<p>According to this we can say that the dates were marked by the passage of time (i.e. 24 hours was one day) rather than by the sun's rising and setting.</p>\n\n<p>This is reminiscent of a story that is told about the Ba'al HaTanya when he was <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15696&st=&pgnum=38\" rel=\"nofollow\">imprisoned for the first time</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once, for instance, the Rebbe was put into\n  a room which was as dark during the day as it was at night.\n  A small lamp was the only source of light. One day, about\n  two hours after noon, the Rebbe was told that the time is\n  already past midnight and he should go to sleep.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Right now,\" retorted the Rebbe, \"the time is two\n  hours and five minutes past noon.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>When asked how he could possibly know such a thing,\n  the Rebbe explained.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Every day is illuminated by the twelve forms of the\n  letters of in Ineffable Name (Tetragrammaton), while the\n  night is illuminated by the twelve forms of the Name denoting\n  G-d's Lordship.

Do I have to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>wash both my hands?</li>\n<li>wash my right hand?</li>\n<li>wash my pinky finger?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Let us first address a clearly delineated case:\nThere is a law that when urinating in the middle of a meal and using only one hand to clean oneself, one need only wash that hand - Yoma 30a, Shul'han Arukh Ora'h 'Haim 170:1. No differentiation was made regarding the fingers used, so I would assume that in a meal it would be required to still wash the whole hand. So it is clear that you don't need to wash both hands.</p>\n\n<p>Now regarding prayer:\nNevertheless for praying as opposed to eating, since the requirement to wash one's hands fully besides once in the morning in order to pray (according to the opinion accepted as halacha) is not restrictive, and only their cleanliness is (ibid. 92:6), despite that a-priori halacha requires washing the whole hand (ibid. 92:5), nevertheless once already in the middle of prayer that one can't move in, an act of cleaning alone is enough. Therefore when in the middle of the \"Amidah\" it would seem that it would be enough to clean the finger (since we are only concerned with cleanliness and cleaning a clean part of the hand does nothing, as it is already clean). When in a part of prayer that permits walking around, one would have to wash the whole hand (Mishna Berura 92:27) since a priori, more than just \"cleaning\" is required - \"washing\".\nOf course one should not touch the dirty area of the body when in prayer (ram\"a 92:7).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ben Ish Chai (Rabbi Yosef Chayim of Baghdad, 1833-1909), in his work of responsa \"Torah Lishma,\" (Siman 23) clarifies that if one extends only one hand in the restroom, then he is required to wash only that hand; he does not have to wash both hands, since only one hand was exposed to the impurity of the restroom. Nevertheless, Chacham Bentzion Abba Shaul (Jerusalem, 1924-1998) writes his work \"Or Le'tzion\" (Vol. 2, 1:13) that even in such a case one should preferably wash both hands. He apparently understood that the impurity that descends upon the individual's hand spreads even to the second hand, and therefore one should wash both hands, even if only one hand had been in the restroom. He adds that even if a person placed just one finger in the restroom, he should wash both hands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=1231&txtSearch=one%20finger\" rel=\"nofollow\">For more info</a></p>\n\n\n",

Tov Ayin, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32490&pgnum=149\">suggests</a> that the difference is that Yitzchak was named before his birth, and Yaakov only afterwards.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The sefer גבעת שאול <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49843&st=&pgnum=47&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> explains that there are three types of names that Hashem gives:</p>\n\n<p>The first is a name which Hashem gives something/someone that does not previously have a name, and this is only name that the thing/person has. The second is when Hashem changes a person's name slightly, by adding a letter or by a slight change in the letters, but essentially retaining the original name. The third is when Hashem gives someone an additional name and retains the person's original name as well.</p>\n\n<p>And a perfect example of these three types is the names of the Avos: Yitzchok was of the first type, because this was the name given to him by Hashem before he had any other name, as it says \"but Sarah your wife will give birth to you a son, and you will call him Yitzchok\". And Avraham was of the second type, because his first name was Avram which was given to him by his father, and Hashem changed it by adding the letter 'heh' to make his name Avraham, but his original name essentially remained. Finally, Yaakov was of the third type, because Hashem left his first name in place and gave him a new, additional name.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it is well known that the name of a thing/person describes some quality of that person, and it seems to me the effect of these different types of names that Hashem gives is that the greater the change of the name, the greater the quality described by that name is increased. Therefore, when necessity dictates that a name be given to someone to distinguish him from someone else, he will have the quality described by the name, but in a relatively small amount. Therefore, the name Yitzchok teaches about the miracle that occurred with his birth, that \"everyone who hears will laugh\", and the name Yitzchok gave existence to that miracle. Similarly, Yishmael whose name was mentioned before he was born teaches that Hashem would listen to his voice when he was in trouble, as we see happened. The name Shlomo teaches that there would be peace in his days, and the name Yoshiyohu (יאשיהו) teaches about his zealousness for Hashem that would be in his heart (אש י-ה) to remove all the idolatry from the land.</p>\n\n<p>But those who already had a name and subsequently Hashem changed it slightly, this teaches that the effect which their name signifies is much greater than the first type, and will spread across time and affect other people. For example, the name Avram signified that he was the father only of Aram, but Avraham signifies that \"I will make you the father of a multitude of nations\". Sarai signified that she had kingship over only a few, but the name Sarah signifies that this effect would be over the whole world, that from her would come forth kings. And the name Yehoshua taught about the great salvation that there would be for Yisrael through the conquering of Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>However, the third type where the change was even greater with the addition of a new name, this teaches that the effect of that name is far greater and more complete than all of them, because the new name signifies the eternity of the person who, before the new name was given to him, would have died. Therefore, by changing Yaakov's name to Yisrael He made him eternal, and also gave him the effect that the name Yisrael signifies. [This also gives an understanding of the teaching of Chazal: יעקב אבינו לא מת - my comment]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What else could have come out of Yiftach's house?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0711.htm#30\">Judges chapter 11</a> tells of the vow that Yiftach makes to God -- if he is successful in battle he will offer up to God the first thing that comes out of the door of his house to greet him.  As we know, this ends badly for his family.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that people in Yiftach's time did not keep livestock in their homes but in barns or pens (as alluded to in Bamidbar 32 when two and a half tribes want to stay on the other side of the Yarden).  I've been told, but don't have a source, that until the last century or so Jews didn't tend to have pets.  So what might Yiftach have had in mind when he talked about something coming out of his house?  (It says beiti, not a more general word for property.)  Or is the point that this was not only a dangerous vow but also one that <em>couldn't</em> end well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>Your question is based on an incorrect supposition. Archaeology has shown that the typical Israelite dwellings during the Iron age were two floors with animals living on the bottom floor. </p>\n\n<p>See here:\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_room_house\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_room_house</a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a picture of a model of what they think they looked like:\n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Israelite_pillared_house.jpg\">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Israelite_pillared_house.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>Generally the houses had a fenced off area around them and the animals would be free to run in and out throughout the day. At night all the animals were brought into the house for protection from predators and thieves. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>\"What might Yiftach have had in mind when he talked about something coming out of his house?\"</p>\n\n<p>I believe he had in mind that a male member of his family, i.e. one of his sons, would come to greet him. Notice his wording \"וְהָיָה לַיהוָה וְהַעֲלִיתִיהוּ עֹלָה\", which the commentators translate \"It will be for God <strong><em>or</em></strong> I will bring it as an <em>olah</em> offering (if appropriate)\". Yiftach's initial statement was that the first greeter from his home would be dedicated to God. If it would be one of his sons, then that son would be dedicated to the service of God, similar to what Chana did with her son Shmuel. He would become like a <em>kohen</em> or <em>levi</em>. This is what Ralbag suggests here.</p>\n\n<p>Only in his second part of the \"or statement\" does Yiftach acknowledge that what crosses the threshold of his home first may actually not be human, but of his collection of livestock; perhaps not likely, as you suggested, but possible. In this case, he says, he will bring it as an offering to God. [I cannot be sure what he is referring to with \"אֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא מִדַּלְתֵי בֵיתִי לִקְרָאתִי\", but perhaps he was thinking that he may chance upon one of his animals upon approaching his property (unlikely though it is that it would be \"coming to greet\" him).]</p>\n\n<p>Yiftach's mistake was that it didn't seem to cross his mind that his daughter might come out to greet him first. Perhaps he was thinking it more in the nature of sons to come out and greet their father, while daughters (at least in those times) tend to stay inside and wait for the father to arrive. But alas, his daughter came to greet him first, and therefore had to be \"dedicated to God\", which in a woman's case involves celibacy, as a marriage is seen as being \"in service\" of her husband which would undermine her dedication to the service of God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The implication from the gemarah [Taanit 4a*] and Rashi is that he assumed a kosher animal would come out, and that there was a possibility that a non-kosher animal could have come out as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יפתח הגלעדי דכתיב (שופטים יא, לא) והיה היוצא אשר יצא מדלתי ביתי וגו' יכול אפילו דבר טמא</p>\n<p>By contrast, there is the case of Jephthah the Gileadite. Upon leaving for battle he issued a statement, as it is written: “Then it shall be that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace…it shall be to the Lord and I will bring it up for a burnt-offering” (Judges 11:31). This might even have been an impure, non-kosher animal, which he had committed himself to sacrifice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר טמא - כלב או חזיר</p>\n<p>an impure thing - dog or pig</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*translation from Sefaria includes the commentary of R' Steinsaltz</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Questions about Polygamy in Jewish Law and Culture\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've recently been studying polygamy (having more than 1 wife), and had a few cultural questions.</p>\n\n<p>Was polygamy accepted at the time of David and Solomon? Were there any laws about it?</p>\n\n<p>Was polygamy accepted during the first century CE? How common was it in the first century?</p>\n\n<p>Are there any laws on having more than 1 wife in Judaism today? How common is polygamy in Jewish culture today?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 62)\n\n<p>You've come to the right place.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible explicitly allowed a man to have more than one wife. <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&pentid=P2081#C1382\">Exodus 21:10</a> talks about making sure the first wife still gets the same resources and attention now that she's not the only one.</li>\n<li>So yes, it was accepted in the times of Kings David and Solomon. Those kings are recorded as having quite a few wives (though <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&pentid=P5374#C4108\">Deuteronomy 17:17 warns against having too many</a>, \"lest his heart be swayed.\" (King David is recorded as having six; Solomon married way too many, apparently as a form of diplomacy with surrounding nations, and it appeared not to have gone well for him.) We don't know how prevalent it was for the average commoner in that era. Samuel's father, for instance, had two wives. My sense is the average was probably 1.3 or so.</li>\n<li>The best record we have, from a traditional Jewish perspective, on first-century life would be the Talmud, the first stages of which were published around the year 200. Any legal matter pertaining to marriage very clearly accounted for the possibility of more than one wife -- e.g. the Talmud discusses how to divide an estate between multiple wives, or how <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum\">levirate marriage</a> works if there's more than one wife. There is one mention of a limit of 4, just as a practical matter of how much um, \"physical attention\", a normal guy can be expected to provide to all these women. (A recent TV show addressed this issue with a character rushed to the emergency room due to an overdose of blue pills.) There was similar concern for a fellow who traveled between two far-flung places and had a wife and children in each place, that the half-siblings may one day grow up, meet and marry, not knowing of their relationship. (Today this could be solved by DNA testing).</li>\n<li>However, when describing guidelines for a life of wisdom, the Talmud warns \"the more wives, the more witchcraft\" -- you can read that literally, or simply as describing the difficult machinations that can ensue between co-wives. (Similarly, the book of Ecclesiasticus, written close to the first century, speaks of a father worrying that his grown and married daughter \"may turn to witchcraft\", i.e. her marriage may fall apart.) Note that co-wives are referred to by the Talmud as <em>tzarot</em>, i.e. \"competitors.\" Studying the various stories of interactions between rabbis and their wives in the Talmud (and there are many such stories), virtually none involve more than one wife. So it's hard to tell how often it was done. </li>\n<li>Around the year 1000, the rabbinic leadership of Jewry living in France and Germany (or \"Ashkenazic\" Jews, many of whom would later migrate to Eastern Europe) declared a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_ben_Judah#Synod_and_bans\">ban</a> on polygamy, which still stands today. Hence in the English-speaking world today it's virtually unheard of.</li>\n<li>The ban never extended to the Jews of the Mediterranean or Northern Africa (known as \"Sephardic\" Jews). In some communities some ban caught on at some point, and in others polygamy was still not-unheard-of 100 years ago. Jewish marriage contracts from 200 years ago in the Arabic-speaking world often contained a penalty clause if the husband took an additional wife without the first one's permission.  </li>\n<li>In the twentieth century, nearly all Jews from the Arabic-speaking world immigrated to countries speaking European languages (US, Europe, South America, etc.), or to Israel. In the former, polygamy is banned, both by civil law and by de facto Ashkenazic majority standard. In Israel the situation is a bit more complex; my understanding is that 50 years ago, a new Yemeni immigrant to Israel would have been allowed to keep his two wives; today Israeli law increasingly insists on monogamy.</li>\n<li>So it's virtually unheard of today.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, here's how I view polygamy vis-a-vis Judaism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's a lot like <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/Torahd5.asp?action=displayid&id=3017#C2231\">eating grasshoppers</a>. Yes, the Bible allowed it, though never said it was a good thing. Nobody does it today except for a few Yemenites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lastly, and forgive the legal nitty-gritty, on very rare occasion there can be <em>pro forma</em> polygamy today: if a couple's marriage has fallen apart beyond repair (usually this involves a civil divorce), and the husband has made every reasonable effort to go through a religious divorce ritual with his wife but she refuses to cooperate, then if all other options have been exhausted, a lengthy process involving the signature of 100 rabbis can allow the man to leave the ritual divorce document in escrow for his first wife, and then re-marry. So technically Judaism would regard him as married to two women at the same time, but at no point would he come home to two \"wives.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Up to approximately 1000 years ago when Rabbeinu Gershom banned polygamy, Jews were allowed under Jewish law to have more than one wife. The Ashkenazim accepted this prohibition from Rabbeinu Gershom, however the Sephardim did not. However since most Sephardic Jews today live in locations where it is not legally acceptable, therefore even amongst the Sephardim it is uncommon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Halacha absolutely permits polygamy for sphardim. There are two rabbinic decrees concerning polygamy. The shulchan aruch limits the number of wives to four and for Ashkenazim there is an outright ban imposed by Rabbi Gershon the light of the exile around 1000 years ago. Being that these are rabbinic mitzvot they are nullified with the building of the third Temple then any Jewish man can have as many wives as he can afford </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "When do we read a vav prefix as \"or\" rather than \"and\"?",
    "content": "# When do we read a vav prefix as \"or\" rather than \"and\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11035/what-else-could-have-come-out-of-yiftachs-house/11037#11037\">This answer</a> cites the Ralbag as interpreting a (critical-to-the-question) vav prefix on a verb as \"or\".  I've heard before that a vav prefix is not always \"and\" and can be \"or\" or even \"but\".  Is there any grammatical rule by which we can tell when to read it which way, or do all the non-\"and\" readings always arise from judgments about what would make most sense to the interpreter?  Do Chazal generally agree on how any given vav is translated, making it received tradition and there are no explicit rules?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Vav does not necessarily mean and or or.  It is a conjunction and translated according to context.  I translate most vav's as a \"soft then\"- a subsequent event where formal written English would not put a then, but in a conversation, one might say \"so then I...\"</p>\n\n<p>Other possibilities: but (although, however), while, since, therefore.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I thought to do the following experiment to test <strong>\"and\" vs. \"or\"</strong> in the way <strong>Targum Onkelos</strong> interprets the Chumash by searching for the word <strong>או</strong> on both sides of the equation.\nThere is an extreme amount of <strong>vav-prefixes</strong> but a more limited amount of instances of the word <strong>או</strong> both in the Chumash and in the Targum (<em>a total of more than 250 in each</em>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look for <strong>instances of או in the Targum</strong> and see whether they map back    to <strong>instances in Chumash of vav-prefixes</strong></li>\n<li>Look for <strong>instances of או in the Chumash</strong> and see whether they map back to <strong>instances in Targum of vav-prefixes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>The results are as follows:</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> - In <strong>Targum:או to Chumash:vav</strong>, we have the following <strong>single exception in דברים כט:יז</strong> to the normal או=או match</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פֶּן יֵ֣שׁ בָּ֠כֶ֠ם אִ֣ישׁ אוֹ אִשָּׁ֞ה א֧וֹ מִשְׁפָּחָ֣ה אוֹ שֵׁ֗בֶט\nאֲשֶׁר֩ לְבָב֨וֹ פֹנֶ֤ה הַיּוֹם֙ מֵעִם֙ ה֣' אֱלֹהֵ֔ינוּ לָלֶ֣כֶת\nלַעֲבֹ֔ד אֶת אֱלֹהֵ֖י הַגּוֹיִ֣ם הָהֵ֑ם פֶּן יֵ֣שׁ בָּכֶ֗ם\nשֹׁ֛רֶשׁ פֹּרֶ֥ה רֹ֖אשׁ <strong>וְלַעֲנָֽה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דִּלְמָא אִית בְּכוֹן גְּבַר אוֹ אִתָּא אוֹ זַרְעִי אוֹ שִׁבְטָא\nדְּלִבֵּיהּ פְּנִי יוֹמָא דֵין מִדַּחְלְתָא דַּייָ אֱלָהַנָא לִמְהָךְ\nלְמִפְלַח יָת טָעֲוָת עַמְמַיָּא הָאִנּוּן דִּלְמָא אִית בְּכוֹן\nגְּבַר מְהַרְהֵיר חֲטִין <strong>אוֹ זָדוֹן</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps Onkelos sensed that the very end of the pasuk: <strong>פֶּן יֵ֣שׁ בָּכֶ֗ם</strong> שֹׁ֛רֶשׁ פֹּרֶ֥ה רֹ֖אשׁ <strong>וְ</strong>לַעֲנָֽה is parallel to the very beginning of the pasuk: <strong>פֶּן יֵ֣שׁ בָּ֠כֶ֠ם</strong> אִ֣ישׁ <strong>אוֹ</strong> אִשָּׁ֞ה <strong>א֧וֹ</strong> מִשְׁפָּחָ֣ה <strong>אוֹ</strong> שֵׁ֗בֶט\nwhere the clause at the beginning has a pure sequence of \"or\"s.</p>\n<p><em>The תרגום המיוחס ליונתן there keeps it as a vav and doesn't switch it to an או.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> - In <strong>Chumash:או to Targum:vav</strong>, we have the following <strong>single exception in במדבר יא:ח</strong> to the normal או=או match</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁ֩טוּ֩ הָעָ֨ם וְלָֽקְט֜וּ וְטָחֲנ֣וּ בָרֵחַ֗יִם <strong>א֤וֹ דָכוּ֙\nבַּמְּדֹכָ֔ה</strong> וּבִשְּׁלוּ֙ בַּפָּר֔וּר וְעָשׂ֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ עֻג֑וֹת\nוְהָיָ֣ה טַעְמ֔וֹ כְּטַ֖עַם לְשַׁ֥ד הַשָּֽׁמֶן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁיְטִין עַמָּא וְלָקְטִין דְּצָבֵי טָחֵין בְּרִחְיָא <strong>וּדְצָבֵי\nדָּאֵיךְ בִּמְדוֹכְתָא</strong> וּמְבַשְּׁלִין לֵיהּ בְּקִדְרָא וְעָבְדִין\nיָתֵיהּ גְּרִיצָן וְהָוֵי טַעְמֵיהּ כִּטְעֵים דְּלִישׁ בְּמִשְׁחָא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Onkelos actually interprets או as \"and\" (<em>with the caveat that things might have changed here due to the Targum adding in the word ּ<strong>דצבי</strong> for explanatory purposes</em>).</p>\n<p>So it seems at least according to the פשט as interpreted by Targum Onkelos, while vav-prefix=\"and\" and או=\"or\", there can be rare exceptions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Technically, it both never and always means \"and\".</p>\n<p>In Hebrew, each word derives its meaning from a combination of its letters and vowels, each of which has a single fundamental meaning. The Vav prefix consists of a single vav (shva is not a vowel at all, just a marker for pronunciation reasons). Therefore, it reflects the single fundamental meaning of the letter Vav.</p>\n<p>The word \"vav\" in Hebrew means \"hook\". As with every letter, Vav resembles its meaning, appearing as a rod with a shallow hook at the tip.<br />\nThe function of Vav as a prefix, therefore, is to connect the previous word or phrase to the word to which it is attached. In English, we usually use the word \"and\" for such a connection, but the connection indicated by Hebrew Vav is slightly more encompassing than that.</p>\n<p>For example, in the Passuq \"וּמְקַלֵּ֥ל אָבִ֛יו וְאִמּ֖וֹ מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת\", the verse is most literally translated as follows:<br />\n\"And [whomever] curses his father, AND his mother, shall die death.\"<br />\nIn Hebrew, the Vav prefix connects the word \"Father\" to the word \"Mother\" more strongly than the grammatical break indicated by the cantillation (which I represented using a comma). However, in English, the comma is stronger than the word \"and\", which turns the verse into nonsense. Removing the comma, however, would make the verse seem as if the death sentence applies only if he curses <strong>both</strong> his mother <em>and</em> his father, which is not the case. Therefore, the Vav is commonly translated as \"or\" to entirely avoid this problem:<br />\n\"And [whomever] curses his father OR his mother shall die death.\"</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the Vav prefix retains its usual meaning even in this case, where it's translated as \"or.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What justifications are there for not moving to Eretz Yisrael?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in many places is clear that there is some level of mitzvah to live in Israel. This is also the accepted consensus among the rishonim. In the past, it was very difficult to move to Israel, as the journey alone had many dangers, and no one knew what would await them when they arrived in the desolate land. However, nowadays it is very simple to move to Israel, and one doesn't even need to pay for the 12-hour flight there. It's not even difficult financially as Israel has a growing economy, and parents do not need to pay for their children's tuition. </p>\n\n<p>So what justifications are there for not moving to Eretz Yisrael?</p>\n\n<p>Some say that the Mitzvah to live in Israel is only a Mitzvah Kiyumis, so one is not obligated to fulfill it, but what evidence is there for that position? How do we even know such a concept exists? Every man has to learn torah, daven, wear tefillin, eat in the sukkah, etc. so why should yishuv eretz yisrael be different?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Rambam states explicitly in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e505.htm#7\">Hilchos Melachim 5:7</a> that it is permissible to live in chutz la'aretz.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>One reason taught to me is that there is still work to be done in the Diaspora. You must take into account the contribution you can make and are making to the Jews in your country of origin, and what effect its loss might have on them.</p>\n\n<p>I remember my Rosh Yeshivah pointing out to us that Yeshivah bochurim are special and valuable members of the community. South African Jewry is not about to make aliyah en masse and it needs learned people to teach and guide and be an example. We should add our strength to SA Jewry and not abandon them without considering the effect this would have on the community.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are plenty of Alumni of my Yeshivah who have successfully and happily made aliyah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Mitzvos aseh seem to have different levels of chiyuv and 'exemptions'. In general, mitzvos aseh do not require one to spend an exorbitant amount of money to fulfill. Certain mitzvos have particular parameters for being fulfilled that can exempt a person when they are absent. </p>\n\n<p>For example, there is a mitzvah to eat and sleep in the sukkah on sukkos. Yet if it is too hot or cold or its raining, one is exempt. One is also exempt if he is travelling or caring for the sick. The Gemara says a general principle of \" 'teshvu'-k'ein taderu\" - i.e. one must dwell in the sukkah like one lives in a house. In many cases, one wouldn't live in a house in such a case, so one need not stay in the sukkah either. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Gemara mentions different reasons that permit someone to leave eretz yisrael - to learn torah, for parnassah, or to find a wife. Perhaps one can also say about Yishuv eretz Yisrael \" v'yashavtem -'k'ein yashuvu\" that one does not need to live in Israel if one won't be able to live a normal life there (See R.H.Schachter). This may be even more broad than by Sukkos, since one will be there for more than 7 days, so other factors can come into play. For example, some people may not know anyone there, or feel that they cannot find the right community there. Some may also be worried for security reasons, even if its not actually 'pikuach nefesh' for other cases. Maybe these and other factors can also be exemptions to the mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>However, a small financial difference would not exempt someone. In addition, not finding the right community could maybe help an individual, but what about the whole community? Why don't large numbers of them move to Israel together? Also, it seems in many cases in halacha and practice that matters remain as they are even if the reasons no longer apply. People may have had legitimate reasons in previous centuries for not moving to Israel, so that became the established practice, even if it nowadays conditions are very different. It is also hard to move to a completely new place, so sometimes people fail to do it, such as the Jews in the time of Ezra. So people need to evaluate if their reasons are legitimate, or its just out of lack of initiative. </p>\n\n<p>For further discussion and reasons, see R.H.S Schachter's <a href=\"http://www.doingzionism.org.il/resources/view.asp?id=1442\" rel=\"nofollow\">essay</a> and R.A.Lebowitz's <a href=\"http://www.bknw.org/library/articles/miscellaneous/Yishuv%20Eretz%20Yisrael.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">outline and sources</a>. </p>\n\n\n",

He explains previous commentators as understanding that Avraham's pain in killing his own son, although less than Yitzchak's pain of actually being killed, would last throughout the rest of his life, and thus would have been much worse than Yitzchak's pain. In his words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם כן  יצחק שמסר  עצמו לשחיטה עם היות צער  המות  שלו יותר גדול מצער אביו שישחטהו הנה  צערו לא היה מתמיד כי מיד שישחט לא ירגיש כלום ולא יצטער עוד. אבל הזקן ההורג את בנו יהיה צערו מתמיד ומרת נפשו קודם השחיטה ובעת השחיטה ואחריה כל ימי חייו יום ולילה לא ישבות. ולכן היה ראוי ליחס פלא המעשה הזה לאברחם ולא ליצחק</p>\n<p><em>Yitzchak, who gave himself up for slaughter, even though his pain of death would be greater than that of his father's who would slaughter him, his pain would not be constant and continuing, since after he is killed he will not feel anything; his pain will be over. But the father who kills his son, his pain will continue, and his bitterness before, during, and after the act of slaughter will never rest. Therefore, it is appropriate to attribute the marvel and wonderment of this event to Avraham rather than to Yitzchak.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[I myself, however, disagree with the assumption that Avraham's pain would have been less than Yitzchak's at all. It makes more sense to me, as @zaq wrote in the comments, that it is harder to kill one's \"only\" son than to be killed himself.]</p>\n<p>Abarbanel, however, feels that although the above may be true, Yitzchak should have at least been given <em>some</em> credit while we don't really find that he is given much at all. Therefore, he disagrees with your basic assumption: <code>Yet Yitzchok knew and also agreed to go along with it.</code> He believes, rather, that Yitzchak was unaware that he was going to be offered as a sacrifice until his father actually tied him onto the <em>mizbeach</em>. Thus, he doesn't really deserve as much credit, since he did not actually go through with the plan willingly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Tzemach Tzedek, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=270\" rel=\"nofollow\">Derech Mitzvosecha 186b</a> brings this same question in the name of R' Menachem Mendel of Horodok.\nHe asks it much the same as you did, but he adds that Yitzchak was 37, and if he had wanted to.....:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובזה ית' מה דקשיא טובא מדוע יחס הכתוב נסיון דעקידה לאברהם הלא יותר היה נסיון ליצחק וכדאי' קושיא זו בזהר שהרי יצחק הי' אז בן ל\"ז שנה, ואילו לא רצה כו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Menachem Mendel answers that the main point of this story is not \"mesirus nefesh\" (self-sacrifice) at all. The Patriarchs were all \"chariots\" (completely subservient, as a chariot to the rider) to the Divine Will. Any one of them could, and would (and did), lay down their life for G-d. So the fact that Yitzchak did that is not so amazing. (Plus, as @Menachem says in his answer, Yitzchak may have even asked for this test).</p>\n\n<p>(Jews of all levels have done that throughout our history, including Jews who, up until that moment, hadn't considered themselves Jewish at all. While self-sacrifice is a tremendous thing for us, for a Tzaddik its practically peanuts. Being willing to sacrifice one's son, their only son, whom they love - that's different. Especially for Avraham, who was the embodiment of the attribute of Chesed (kindness), this was in direct conflict with his essence).</p>\n\n<p>R' Menachem Mendel actually adds, that despite that Avraham was willing to sacrifice his son for G-d, the most amazing thing about this story is that Avraham wasn't flustered or confused at all. After all, G-d had previously promised that He would make Yitzchak into a great nation, and now He was asking Avraham to sacrifice him!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וה\"ז יכול לחשוב שזהו שינוי רצון וכתיב לא שניתי כו' ואברהם נתחזק ולא הרהר כלל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avraham might have thought that this was a change in G-d's Will (and G-d has said \"I haven't changed\"), but nevertheless his faith was strong, and he had no doubts in G-d at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In a note to the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21858&pgnum=169\">Rada\"l's commentary on the Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer (Chapter 31)</a>, the Rada\"l addresses this issue.</p>\n\n<p>He points out the Midrash that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8217/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-22.htm#v1\">Rashi (Bereshit 22:1)</a> quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And some say,“ after the words of Ishmael,” who was boasting to Isaac that he was circumcised at the age of thirteen, and he did not protest.

But <em>Bera</em>'s gifts were awarded to him for distasteful acts, so he understood that those could not be the means <em>Hashem</em> intended for him to gain wealth. So he declined them: if those are not the fulfillment of the <em>Hashem</em>'s promise, then he didn't want to take them. (This fits in with <em>Rashi</em> (as one might expect of the <em>Gur Arye</em>): <em>Rashi</em> says he had <em>Hashem</em>'s promise in mind when he refused <em>Bera</em>'s gifts.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My kid answered that <em>Avram</em> didn't want <em>Bera</em> to say he had enriched him, but there was little fear of that from <em>Par'o</em> who, being distant, would not hear if <em>Avram</em> became rich [rather than, perhaps, losing his money to bandits on the way home].</p>\n\n<p>And I heard in the name of an irreligious Jew that <em>Avram</em> was unwilling to accept gifts as recompense for doing kindness so as to increase <em>kidush Hashem</em>, whereas that concern was irrelevant in <em>Mitzrayim</em>. (This does <em>not</em> easily fit in with <em>Rashi</em>, who says he didn't want to accept from <em>Bera</em> because of <em>Hashem</em>'s promise.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The book <em>Hege Yona</em> (Jerusalem 5756), by my grandfather-in-law Rabbi <em>Yona</em> Munk, includes the following (in my own free translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>14:23: \"or if I take anything from you, lest you say 'I enriched <em>Avram</em>'\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The question that arises is why <em>Avraham</em> agreed to take gifts from <em>Par'o</em> and <em>Avimelech</em>, not worrying they'd say they enriched <em>Avram</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>One can simply differentiate: He had no choice but to take from <em>Par'o</em> and <em>Avimelech</em>, as they were rulers over the land he was in, and not accepting their gifts would slight them, which could be dangerous to him. The king of <em>S'dom</em> was different: <em>Avram</em> had just saved his life, and he was completely poor.</p>\n  \n  <p>But truly, he accepted <em>Par'o</em> and <em>Avimelech</em>'s gifts willingly, as he knew this was from <em>Hashem</em>, a fulfillment of \"<em>vaavarech'cha</em>\" (as <em>Rashi</em> explains, with money). But one can infer from the following verse, \"<em>vaavar'cha m'var'checha</em>\", where <em>Hashem</em>'s blessing is written before that of the person who blesses <em>Avraham</em> (as opposed to \"<em>umkalelcha aor</em>\", where <em>Hashem</em>'s curse is written after the people's), that the blessing of <em>Hashem</em> will have already reached those who try to benefit <em>Avram</em>. That is, they will benefit him when already rich. So it didn't make sense that \"<em>vaavar'cha m'var'checha</em>\" would be talking about a gift from someone lowly like the king of <em>S'dom</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>And one can make an additional distinction. <em>Par'o</em> and <em>Avimelech</em>, whose punishment came through a revelation of <em>Hashem</em> to them (<em>Par'o</em> knew the punishment he was getting was for <em>Saray</em>), understood that <em>Hashem</em> wanted to protect <em>Avraham</em> and <em>Sara</em>, so gave them gifts to enrich them, as an appeasement of <em>Hashem</em>. Therefore, <em>Avraham</em> didn't worry they'd say \"I enriched <em>Avraham</em>\". The king of <em>S'dom</em>, on the other hand, had no angel appear to him, and he only made his offer of riches to <em>Avram</em> after he saw that <em>Avram</em> had given <em>maaser</em> to <em>Malki Tzedek</em>. His offer \"<em>v'es har'chush kach lach</em>\" implies that he considered the wealth his own, and that he was giving it to <em>Avram</em> (otherwise, he could just say \"<em>ten li hanefesh</em>\") — but really it was <em>Avram</em>'s and his men's, as spoils of war. This gall of the king of <em>S'dom</em>, especially that he said this after <em>Avram</em> tithed, as if to say \"don't tithe until it's yours\", is what angered <em>Avram</em>. So he answered \"<em>v'im ekach mikol asher <strong>lach</strong> v'al tomar ani heesharti es Avram</em>\". Meaning, \"from someone like you, who maintains that the wealth is his own, as you've just insisted on publicly, I can't accept, as you'll say 'I enriched <em>Avram</em>'. I will be enriched by <em>Hashem</em>, in a way that everyone will know that he did it\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I understand his last explanation correctly, he means to distinguish the <em>S'dom</em> case from the others by saying that <em>Bera</em> would not acknowledge that <em>Avram</em>'s wealth would come from <em>Hashem</em>, so would say \"I enriched <em>Avram</em>\", whereas the other kings would acknowledge <em>Avram</em>'s wealth would come from <em>Hashem</em>. How did <em>Avram</em> know this? By the facts that (1) <em>Bera</em> was so audacious as to incorrectly insist the wealth was his own, and (2) the other kings were appeasing <em>Hashem</em> by offering the gifts.</p>\n\n\n",

(Note that it's right opposite the leftmost letter when the paper is folded in half, as it was.) <em>Yod vav</em> seems plausible, as does, perhaps, just <em>vav</em> (with the apparent <em>yod</em> just an ink transference), or even nothing at all (all an ink transference). Note that if the paper was folded immediately after it as written, the last letter written (presumably the leftmost letter) would have smudged most. If we assume that first thing is a smudge, there may still be a <em>yod</em> or two hidden under it.</li>\n<li>The first apparent double-apostrophe is very high in the line, much higher than the apparently second double-apostrophe.

Perhaps the first one is meant as an end-of-truncation mark (IIRC I've seen people use double-apostrophes for this) whereas the second one is meant as a middle-of-initialism mark. Or maybe the first one is a smudge (but not likely, as there's nothing opposite it across the fold). Or something else.</li>\n<li>The <em>ches</em> has a very nice long <em>tag</em> whereas the <em>bes</em> does not.

Or, realized since asking the question, would his captors have expected not a fight at all, but a ransom negotiation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have not found records of night warfare in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hittite</a> period in question. However, I have found evidence of night warfare from the period of Classical Antiquity, and earlier. For example Yehoshua sends 30000 men to lie in ambush at Ai, as recorded in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.8.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua (8:4)</a>, although that was just troop movement, but not battle. More significantly, in <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/apo/ma1004.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Maccabees (4:1-5)</a> Gorgias attempts to attack Judas Maccabeus at night. Similarly, II Macabees (8:7) states that Judas Maccabeus  preferred surprising enemies at night.  Additionally, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battle of Thermopylae</a> was fought at night as recorded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Diodorus</a>, although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Herodotus</a> doesn't mention this, and many historians are skeptical (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae#Sources\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). </p>\n\n<p>So, it seems that fighting at night was not so unheard of as to be a miracle. Notably, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.14.36?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Samuel (14:36)</a> portrays Shaul planning on attacking the Philistines at night, although he does not go through with this battle. Context (such as the troops willingness) indicates that this was not completely out of the ordinary or miraculous.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Judges (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.7.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:9</a>-22) portrays Gideon conducting a night battle against the Midianites.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_H._Cline\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eric Cline</a> writes <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=DM32ynvakvEC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=earliest%20night%20battle%20in%20history&source=bl&ots=Ypz_kW6pOz&sig=h69vMPP49w_VLzJNOrPq8r2O1a4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1yvTq9qvYAhVsluAKHZezDRkQ6AEITjAG#v=onepage&q=earliest%20night%20battle%20in%20history&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that this is the first night battle in history for which we have a detailed account. I do not see any indication from there whether this was standard. Notably, Gideon is scared and commanded to proceed by God, but I see no indication that this was because it was night. </p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=DuJvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT288&lpg=PT288&dq=history%20of%20night%20warfare&source=bl&ots=HQ4LLogp3o&sig=YmYC0jKtx80paVuQoSa3wPerLvE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim7K-X56vYAhXjSd8KHRTrCdkQ6AEIWzAL#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20night%20warfare&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this book</a>, night warfare had always been practiced, but was considered risky, difficult, and exceptional.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we see Avraham's willingness to risk himself to save Lot. On the other hand, it seems that this was a pursuit that dragged into night (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> to 14:15). It could be argued that Avraham was less exceptional since battles continuing into the night were more common than those starting at night (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_combat#Classical_antiquity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). However, that seems to have been due to the difficulty of coordinating and disengaging armies, while Avraham and his relatively small party (just 318) could have likely disengaged, and called off the pursuit. Thus, it seems likely that this battle was somewhat exceptional, which is likely why the verse mentions the nighttime in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, and this doesn't contradict the suggestion that he bravely risked himself through the night pursuit, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obadiah_ben_Jacob_Sforno\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seforno</a> (ibid) suggests that he used the cover of night to hide the small size of his party.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kara\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Kara</a> (viewable <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/14.15#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) reads the verse differently, understanding that Avraham sped up the chase to avoid it extending into the night given the impracticality of night warfare.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You must remember that this victory was a miracle. Rashi brings an opinion that Avraham and Eliezer alone fought the actual fight. So the question may be when is it more preferable to have a miracle and not what were the tactics at that time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I believe that humanity invented raiding (robbing, stealing, kidnapping) before warfare. warfare demands some kind of society and government.</p>\n\n<p>Bearing in mind that Avram was seriously outnumbered (~300 vs combined army of five major kingdoms) and outclassed (herdsmen vs experienced soldiers), going hand-to-hand in a battlefield would be downright suicide, so the only reasonable (still, very daring!!) strategy is some kind of a raid, not even an attack:<br>\n1) Scout and spot the location of the captives in the camp.<br>\n2) Wait to night time.<br>\n3) Hope that the guard's discipline is lacking, being victorious and on the way home.<br>\n4) Get in fast, get out faster.<br>\nI believe that breaking the rival army was unexpected result, they weren't even trying to get this!</p>\n\n\n",

While R'Yehuda holds \"lulav tzorech egged\" (they need to be tied), and therefore one must use part of the 4 minim to tie it, the halacha is not like R'Yehuda. Thus you can use anything to tie the 4 minim, or nothing at all. In fact, the Gemara says the anshei Yerushalayim would use gold to tie their lulavim. </p>\n\n<p>Even though its not required, we have a minhag anyways to tie it to make it look nicer, and that may be the reason we used dried lulav to do that also.

    "content": "# What's the deal with all the washings?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sometimes we wash with a cup, sometimes not; sometimes we wash twice, sometimes thrice; and not everyone agrees on method or pattern in all cases.  Who says which ways we are supposed to wash, in which situations, and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Sources: Mishnah Yadayim, Chullin 106a, Chagigah 18b, Shabbos 14b</p>\n\n<p>There are, of course, two reasons to wash hands. One is physical cleanliness the other is for Taharah. I think physical cleanliness is understood. Hands need to be completely physically clean <strong>before</strong> washing them for Taharah.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, DeOraisah, there was no specific Tumah of the hands. If something made a person Tamei then their whole body was Tamei. The Sanhedrin decreed that hands could become Tamei derabbanan under certain circumstances. The first such decrees came in the time of King Solomon and were expanded by the Sanhedrin over time. These decrees were made so that people should be careful about touching certain things such as Torah scrolls or other holy writings or Terumah. Later this was expanded even to touching Chullin (as a precaution for Terumah) so that today we need to wash before eating bread. Tumah of the hands also occurs if we touch certain parts of our body that are normally covered. It is possible that while a person sleeps this may happen or if a person is not paying attention this may happen so that we need to wash hands before doing certain things such as saying a berachah or praying or learning Torah. There is also an additional decree that water that touches hands that are Tamei can make other things Tamei. That is Tamei hands are Tamei in the second degree but water that touches them becomes Tamei derabbanan in the first degree. Today we only continue to do this as a takanah since everyone has a status of second degree Tumah out of doubt anyway.</p>\n\n<p>For washing the hands to be effective in terms of Taharah it must be done in one of two ways. One way is to put your (physically clean) hands once into a valid mikvah at least up to the wrists. This can be done with both at once or with either hand first so long as the Tamei hand doesn't touch the Tahor hand in between. For example, if you dipped your right hand into the Mikvah, took it out and then touched it with the still Tamei left hand then the right hand would become Tamei again so it would have to be dipped again.</p>\n\n<p>The other way is to pour water water from a vessel over them. The vessel has to be a complete unbroken vessel of at least a certain size. Each hand needs to be washed at least twice. Once to purify the hand and then a second time to purify the water on the hands (because of the decree that such water becomes Tamei). The first washing must be exactly up to the wrist. If it doesn't go up to the wrist it doesn't purify the hand. If the water from the first washing touches any part of the body above the wrist it makes the body (including the hand) Tamei again. If the Tahor hand is touched by a Tamei hand or by Tamei water then it becomes Tamei again.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent these problems and make sure the hands are properly purified various customs and practices of hand washing were instituted. Some people also have the custom to wash even more than two times.</p>\n\n<p>In practice today we wash before eating bread or upon waking up from a sleep of at least half an hour. One should also wash hands before learning Torah, praying or saying a berachah unless one has had his attention on his hands to make sure they have remained clean.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maran writes (Shulhan Arukh 4:1) that one shall wash his hands in the morning and make the Berakha \"Al Netilat Yadayim.\" The Rama writes (ibid.) that one that did not use the restroom recites the Berakha of \"Asher Yasar\" anyways. However, we do not follow this Pesaq, because Rabenu HaAri writes (Sha'ar HaKawanot pg. 2) that one does not make a Berakha if he did not use the restroom (and the Rashash also writes so). Maran continues (ibid.) that waters that are unusable for washing for a meal are permitted for Netilat Yadayim in the morning, however some one doesn't bless upon them. </p>\n\n<p>The Halakha Berura brings down five opinions as to the reason one washes their hands in the morning (however the answer of the Ari HaQadosh is not written in Halakha Berura): Introduction- The Gemara writes (Berakhot 60b) that one makes the Berakha \"Barukh Ata A-donai E-lohenu Melekh HaOlam Asher Qideshanu Miswotaw WeSiwanu Al Netilat Yadayim.\"</p>\n\n<p>The answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first answer is in the Zohar HaQadosh (Parashat WaYesheb 184b) when one sleeps his pure soul leaves his body and he tastes the taste of death and the evil spirit rests upon his body and even when his soul returns the evil spirit is still present, and in order to remove this one must wash their hands </li>\n<li>The second answer is from the Gemara in Shabbat (108b-109a) the evil spirit rests upon one's hands at night and it doesn't leave until one washes their hands properly. This has nothing to do with the sleeping, it has to do with the night. </li>\n<li>The third is from the Rosh (Berakhot 9:23) one's hands are disgusting because while one sleeps their are bound to touch disgusting places. </li>\n<li>The fourth answer is from HaRashba HaQadosh (Shu\"t 1:191) in the morning a person is as a \"new creation\" as it written (Ekha 3:23) \"New to the morning; Your faithfulness is great.\" For this reason we are required to thank Hashem that He created us for His honor and to respect His name. </li>\n<li>The fifth answer is from Rabbi Dawid Abuderham (Hilkhot Netilat Yadayim Shaharit) just like the Kohanim must wash their hands before the service of the Hashem in the Bet HaMiqadash so too a man must wash his hands prior to serving his Creator, in order to serve Him with clean hands. </li>\n<li>However the sixth answer is brought down in the Sefer of the Ari HaQadosh \"in whose words we live by [a saying by Rabenu Masliah Ma'azuz]\" Sha'ar HaKawanot (pg. 2) one's hands touch disgusting places and therefore one must wash them (so far- same as the Rosh). One must wash their hands in order to remove the Qelipah referred to as \"Shibta\" and that is the reason that we wash our hands in the morning. It is very important to note: it DOES make a practical difference in reason for the washing because according to some one would be unable to bless in some situations (Halakha Berura ibid.).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is an authoritative article at <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/376\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/376</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Washing in the morning.

The attribution of fully developed monotheism to Moses is certainly going beyond the evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this a well accepted theory? If so, when did monotheism take over?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 31)\n\n<p>There is no sufficient evidence to prove this concept in one direction or another, and there never will be.  I will try explain why.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure where to begin, so I will just do an info dump of points which hopefully will be sufficient, because this is a complicated topic.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Monolatrism is a made up word used to try to discredit Judaism and Christianity.  It is not applied to Hindus or the Japanese in which the word might actually make sense. (Everyone has their own ancestors, but I only worship my own)</p></li>\n<li><p>If I talk about the Greek's acceptance of the Greek pantheon, there is no way to know if I also believe in the pantheon, or if I'm only talking about what I assume other people used to believe. This is because you can never know what my true beliefs are.</p></li>\n<li><p>Since Abraham and the Jewish people in general (until the spread of Christianity and Islam) where the only Monotheistic religion in the area, there is no way to know if when speaking about the gods of other cultures if they were accepted as real, or used as general concepts regarding the people who believed in them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Wellhausen and other scholars who demand an evolution of ideas rather than a revelation of ideas can interpret statements to prove their claim, while religious people can also read statements and archaeological evidence to prove their claim.  This is because you are talking about the beliefs of the people rather than their actions, and there is no way to know what they thought inside of their heads.</p></li>\n<li><p>I already said this, but I'll try saying it another way... Let us assume that the Jewish people (since before moses even) thought all other gods were fiction, the same way we believe all TV charachters to be fiction.  If someone writes a book, say <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Pooh\"><em>The Tao of Pooh</em></a>... is that evidence that the author believes Winnie the pooh to be a real person?  The author certainly treats Winnie the Pooh as if he is real, and a super wise monk at that.  How are we to know if when the Jews write about foreign powers or other gods that they believe in their existence rather then just using the ideas behind those fictional characters as a jumping point to explain Jewish concepts?  In the same way Winnie the Pooh, is used and treated as if he is a real person to help explain concepts of Taoism to Americans.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lastly, the modern way in which we describe things as truly existing, or being abosultly true, or being completely false are really modern ideas, and this is hard to wrap one's mind around sometimes.  The concept of Monolatrism is a new idea (relatively) which tries to pigeon hole ancient minds into modern categories.</p></li>\n<li><p>The fact that the bible talks about the Jewish people worshiping other deities proves to us that at least some Jews did believe in the other deities existence and even worshiped them... but that makes them Polytheists not Monolatrists.</p></li>\n<li><p>How does one refute an idea or concept without, at least on the surface, give credence or an appearance of belief about that concept?  This is often a criticism of Atheists and the criticism has been turned into a method of argumentation. What I mean by this is that one will argue that atheists do not get emotional about the existence of leprechauns, but they do about the existence of Gd, proving that they do believe in Gd on some level, but don't believe in leprechauns. This has created the bizarre and intellectually indefensible statement that Gd and Leprechauns are the same thing.  Wellhausen and his creation of the term Mololatrism has forced the same argument onto ancient Jewish thought.</p></li>\n<li><p>In my mind, the entire concept is about as useful as the proposition that we are all living in the Matrix.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Monotheism is argued to have started with Abraham, although we know that there was also an individual named Malchei-Tzedek who believed in and worshiped a single deity as well. Jewish tradition teaches that this was Shem, one of Noah's sons.</p>\n\n<p>For those who argue that Monolatrism is real, they argue that Monotheism did not become popular until sometime after Ezra, or during the time of the Talmud.  This is part of their general argument that Rabbinic Judaism is a completely different religion than the Biblical religion(s).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>From the standpoint of Jewish tradition, which accepts that the Pentateuch was transmitted to Moses in its entirety around 3,300 years ago, it is clear that the Jewish religion was always monotheistic rather than monolatristic. See Deuteronomy (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0504.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">4:35</a>): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD, He is God; there is none else beside Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ibid., 4:39:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Know this day, and lay it to thy heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also note Isaiah (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1044.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">44:6</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am the First and I am the Last, and besides me there are no gods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similar examples include II Samuel (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b07.htm#22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7:22</a>), Isaiah (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1045.htm#5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">45:5</a>, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1045.htm#21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">45:21-22</a>, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1046.htm#9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">46:9</a>), Psalms (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2686.htm#10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">86:10</a>), and I Chronicles (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25a17.htm#20\" rel=\"noreferrer\">17:20</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In the context of the above verses, it is evident that passages referring to other deities do not imply that the Bible recognizes that they exist in the same sense that devotees of those religions believe, but rather that they exist within the beliefs and mythologies of those religions. </p>\n\n<p>There were periods when many Jews abandoned Judaism to worship other deities (sometimes without totally rejecting traditional Jewish worship, see for example <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a18.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kings I, 18:21</a>), and there were probably other individuals who exhibited monolatristic beliefs, but this was a departure from the normative Judaism of the Bible.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are two ways to look at \"powers other than Hashem\" (everything from Idols to Sun and Moon etc.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>They exist - well yes, Baal (as an idol) exists. The golden calf existed. However, they are a bunch of stones/wood/gold that are totally powerless and foolish.</p></li>\n<li><p>They exist, and <em>they actually give</em>, but they do it without free will - The sun gives heat but it has no choice. It to do so like a carriage in the hand of a rider - <em>most</em> people don't thank their car after driving it.</p>\n\n<p>Even in this way, if one were to think that these forces had freedom of choice (and therefore, power), he would be guilty of idol-worship. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

He expressed that connection by the presence of the <em>sh'china</em> and by the miracles that took place; we did by our service there. Once we had sinned sufficiently, that connection became weak enough that it would no longer be honestly expressed by the miracles and <em>sh'china</em>, which left. How destruction is a consequence of that I don't quite know, but it seems tenable.</p>\n\n\n",

The first guy really dose everything he can to honor Shabbos - nice clothing, delicacies, clean house, etc. The second guy dose nothing - he doesn't prepare for Shabbos, his house is a mess, he doesn't cook, he doesn't even change his cloths. All he dose the entire Shabbos is, say, to sleep!</p>\n\n<p>While the second guy didnt <em>desecrate</em> Shabbos per se, his reward is surely much less that the person that treated Shabbos with due respect!

We sing כל מקדש שביעי <strong>כראוי לו</strong> referring to a person observing Shabbos as it <strong>appears to him</strong> to be the seventh day, or כל שומר שבת <strong>כדת</strong> meaning someone that observes the <strong>proper</strong> 7th day. For each of them שכרו הרבה מאד על פי פעלו because we don't judge based on a set standard, rather איש על מחנהו ואיש על דגלו - we judge each person based on their current מצב.</p>\n\n<p>(and while the text there is not indicative of this, it could be that with this explanation איש על מחנהו ואיש על דגלו can be explained literally: we dont judge them both on the same standard because one person is על מחנהו - \"in the camp\" - and knows when Shabbos is, and the other is  על דגלו - \"[resting] on his flag\", i.e. in a temporary place/in the wilderness and does not know when the real 7th day is)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The action has already been specified as proper sanctification and keeping of Shabbat.

Therefore, they abandoned the yes/no and instead said 'Hashem Echad'.</p>\n<p>I was unable to locate (with minimal searching) the Midrash Rabba in question.</p>\n<p>But I see rony's answer, with the detail that the first two were said with a single dibbur, based on a statement in the Zohar Chadash, and put together by the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/rabbigershonsteinberg/home/yitro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Belzer Rebbe</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על כל דיבור ודיבור אמרו ישראל הן הן לאו לאו שנאמר לאמר. \"אנכי ולא יהיה לך בדיבור אחד נאמרו\", (זוהר חדש סוף פ' יתרו), וזהו שנאמר בתהילים אחת דיבר א-להים שתים זו שמעתי, (גימטריאות לר\"י החסיד ואתחנן). והנה בעת ששמעו בני  ישראל את שני הדברות הראשונות בבת אחת נפחדו ונבהלו ולא ידעו מה לענות אם יענו \"הן\" יש לטעות בדבריהם ולהבין ח\"ו שאמרו הן על הלאו ד\"לא יהיה לך\" ואם יענו \"לאו\" יש לטעות בדבריהם ולהבין שאמרו לאו על הדיבור \"אנכי ה' אלקיך\" שאינם רוצים ח\"ו לקבל עול מלכותו ואחדותו ית\"ש לזאת שמו עצה בנפשם וצעקו כולם פה אחד \"ה' אלקינו ה' אחד\" ודיבור זה עלה להם יפה על שני הדברות כפי שידוע שצריך לכוון בעת קריאת שמע ה' אלקינו \"אנכי ה' אלקיך\" ה' אחד \"לא יהיה לך אלוהים אחרים\" וזה מרומז במה שאנו אומרים בזמירות שבת \"ובאו כולם בברית יחד נעשה ונשמע אמרו כאחד ופתחו וענו ה' אחד\"      (מהר\"ש  מבעלזא זי\"ע).‏</p>\n<p>The Jews answered \"Yes, Yes\", \"No, No\" to every one of the 10 Commandments, as it says \"Leimor\" (Shemot 20:1).

When the Jewish People heard the first two commandments simultaneously, they were afraid and confused and did not know how to respond. If they would answer \"No\" it could be mistakenly understood that they were saying \"No\" to the Commandment \"I am the L-rd your G-d\", as if they did not want to accept the yolk of Heaven and G-d's Unity (G-d Forbid). They found a solution to this by calling out as one, \"The L-rd is our G-d, the L-rd is One\".

    "content": "# Why do we use a tight heuristic for fish egg kashrut and not trust supervision?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently listened to <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/article/the_baffling_enigma_of_the_bowfin_egg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this podcast</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.oukosher.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU Kashrut Division</a> on the kashrut of Bowfin eggs in particular and of fish eggs in general, and I learned something interesting about the kashrut of fish eggs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eggs from a kosher fish are not considered kosher if they are black-colored, perhaps even if they are dyed black.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reason for this, if I understand correctly, is that it was determined by Talmudic or post-Talmudic authorities that all red fish eggs come from kosher fish, so if we only allow red fish eggs, we can prevent anyone from eating eggs that they think come from a kosher fish, but don't.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering why we employ such a restrictive heuristic, entirely excluding the eggs of various kosher fish species just because the eggs aren't obviously kosher by visual inspection, instead of allowing some other reliable demonstration (e.g. the testimony of a God-fearing Jew) of their provenance. Why don't we treat fish eggs similarly to how we treat:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Fish fillets, whose fish of origin is difficult to determine once they've been butchered, so we just make sure to buy them from a kosher fish butcher?</p></li>\n<li><p>Kosher beef, which is physically indistinguishable from non-kosher beef (before the former is salted, or if the latter happens to have been salted for some reason), so we require that it came from a reputable slaughterer and that it was guarded along the way?</p></li>\n<li><p>Milk, whose animal of origin can (in theory) be difficult to determine, so we <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholov_Yisroel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">require</a> that its provenance is verified all the way from the source, either by Jewish supervision or, at least according to many, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/2926/in-what-countries-is-chalav-yisrael-not-required-for-milk\">certain</a> governments' supervision?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Who said we don't treat fish eggs the same way?</p>\n\n<p>You can certainly buy OU-certified black caviar (from whitefish, for instance, see: <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000LR0MHI\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Kosher-Black-Whitefish-Caviar-Orthodox/dp/B000LR0MHI</a>) So it follows the same rules as all of the items you mentioned -- as long as it was supervised when it was extracted to make sure it came from a kosher fish.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the rule according to the Beis Yosef is that red eggs are kosher, even without any supervision, and black eggs are not. And you might read the Beis Yosef to imply that even with supervision, black eggs are not. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, see the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14242&st=&pgnum=373\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aruch HaShulchan YD 83:50</a> who says that the Beis Yosef's rule about trusting red eggs without supervision is completely unfounded and that we require supervision for all fish eggs.</p>\n\n<p>The OU follows the lenient view of the Beis Yosef for red eggs (and thus if the caviar are red, no hashgacha is required -- they are ipso facto kosher) but provides supervision for black eggs, thus following the approach of the Aruch HaShulchan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/chulin/insites/ch-dt-064.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This site</a> quotes the following in the name of Beis Yosef: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In order to determine that one did not make a mistake among the variations of black eggs, they prohibited consumption of all black fish eggs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apparently because fish eggs are not a staple like milk or meat, it is easier to impose  safeguards of this kind on them.</p>\n\n\n",

However, judaism in general still prohibits sex outside marriage due to the Rambam.</p>\n\n<p>That seems to because of (correct me if I am wrong) another commandment (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0523.htm#18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 23:18</a>):</p>\n\n<p>There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam equates all sex outside marriage as prostitution. (I'm not sure what sodomite means there).</p>\n\n<p>What is the Rambam's reasoning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rambam himself writes (in his Book of Mitzvos, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/946971/jewish/Negative-Commandment-355.htm\">Negative Commandment 355</a>) his explanation of the relevant verses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>G‑d (exalted be He) has already instructed us in the Torah that a man\n  who has relations with a virgin incurs none of the [capital] punishments,\n  regardless of whether he seduced or raped her. Rather, he must pay a\n  monetary fine and marry the girl that he harmed, as explained in the\n  Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Accordingly, a person might think that since the offender is only\n  required to pay a fine, therefore this is looked upon as a purely\n  financial case. Therefore, just as a person, if he wishes, is allowed\n  to give away his money to another person, or to forgive a debt, so\n  too, [he might think,] he may take his unmarried daughter and give her\n  to a man to have relations with her. This would be like forgiving a\n  debt due to him, since the 50 silver [shekels which the seducer or\n  rapist must pay] go to the father. Alternatively, a person might think\n  that [since this is purely a financial matter,] he may give his\n  daughter on condition that the man pays a certain amount of money.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, the Torah prohibited this and said, \"Do not defile your\n  daughter with premarital relations.\" The monetary fine only refers to\n  a case where the seduction or rape actually occurred. But it is still\n  completely forbidden for them to engage in sexual relations, even when\n  they both agree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes similarly in Mishneh Torah, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960635/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm\">Hil. Naarah Besulah 2:17</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So it's actually not so clear that he holds that <em>all</em> sex outside of marriage is the equivalent of prostitution. It is true that in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952874/jewish/Chapter-One.htm\">Hil. Ishus 1:4</a> he says that \"a person who has relations with a woman for the sake of lust, without <em>kiddushin</em> [the first stage of Jewish marriage], receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because he had relations with a harlot,\" but a number of the commentaries explain, in light of his comments quoted above, that this applies only if she is sexually available to him as well as to others.</p>\n\n<p>According to this approach, an exclusive relationship without marriage may indeed not be included in this prohibition. (It is still unquestionably forbidden, though; in Ishus 1:1 Rambam states that \"once the Torah was given, the Jews were commanded that when a man desires to marry a woman, he must acquire her as a wife in the presence of witnesses.\")</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that Rambam's source (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37625&pgnum=400\">Sifra, Kedoshim 77</a>) doesn't seem to draw such a distinction. It states (my translation): \"'Do not defile your daughter with zenus [sexual immorality]'... this means specifically where the 'defilement' is done for the purpose of 'zenus.' What is such a case? When a man gives to his fellow his unmarried daughter not for the purpose of marriage, and similarly when a woman makes herself [sexually] available not for marriage.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As for the \"sodomite\" thing:</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew phrasing has the same word, in male and female.

The chorus does not contain the name of God, nor is this a <em>davar shbikedusha</em> (a prayer that can only be recited in the presence of a <em>minyan</em> - 10 men). There is no problem with repeating the chorus. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I agree with Yaakov Ellis's answer, and indeed deliberately repeat where the song calls for it.</p>\n\n<p>All of kabbalos Shabbos is a \"recent\" kabbalistic innovation. And there was a great outcry when they instituted it, adding on to the tefillah constructed by Chazal. As a result, to assuage those concerns, there are various kulos associated with it. For instance, that they say it from the middle of the shul, by the bima, rather than at the amud. Or that a katan can lead it.</p>\n\n<p>To then turn around and treat it as davening, such that one goes to great pains to avoid the repetition, seems \"off\".</p>\n\n<p>Also, if one is going to be makpid on this, then one should ideally not have chosen a tune that was built with the assumption of indeed having a repetition.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In terms of the point raised in the comment section, about repeating words rather than a whole passage, I am not aware of any part of Kabbalas Shabbas (or a tune for a part of it) that has one repeating just words, such as <em>Boi v'shalom ateres ba'lah ba'lah\"</em>, which makes for nonsense. The closest I know of is from elsewhere in davening, like <em>Baruch Shenatan Torah, Torah</em>; or <em>uShemo, uShemo, uShemo, echad</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But let us say it did exist. (Update: It does, and Menachem gives examples in the comment section.) There are two points that could <strong>conceivably</strong> be made in favor of such a repetition.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One would repeat it only if there was an existing <em>niggun</em> which prompted this repetition. And as much as <em>kabbalat Shabbat</em> is a recent <em>minhag</em>, so too the <em>tune</em> together with the repetition it assumes is a recent <em>minhag</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Does repetition indeed make for nonsense? Consider the following English lyrics from \"Sesame Street\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can you tell me how to get...How to get to Sesame Street?</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Does the listener really think that there are two questions, one how to get, treating \"get\" as an intransitive verb, and the other as how to get to Sesame Street? Does the listener become confused and think that the song is nonsense? Or does he understand it as part of the structure of the poetry of the song?</p>\n\n<p>Through the ages, Jews have written piyutim conforming to Arabic poetry, or put it to tunes from the general culture. Repetition of words, even where an unthinking person would believe that the result was nonsense, could well be treated as something of this sort. So yes, <strong>\"Boi v'shalom ateres ba'lah ba'lah\"</strong> is saying \"Come in peace, adornment of her husband; her husband.\" But normal people hearing it in the context of a song will understand that the repetition is stylistic, and still make sense of the words. Absent a desire to ritualize it such that each word must be said once, yes, I think it <strong>may</strong> be plausible and acceptable to repeat words.</p>\n\n\n",

Hashem promised the Shabat that Yisrael would be their mate. When standing before Har Sinai Hashem told us: Remember what I promised the Shabat that you are her mate, so remember the Shabat day lekadsho (as a chatan does to the kala). So this may mean that the Schina is telling lecha dodi (we are the dodi) towards the kalah - and the Shabat is the kalah.

However, even if it is considered pareve, one must be aware of potential marit ayin issues, at least until the product becomes widespread.

    "content": "# Why does the Talmud assume a woman cannot get pregnant on the first act of intercourse?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a rule in the Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=34&format=pdf\">Yevamot 34a</a>) that אין אשה מתעברת בביאה ראשונה. The question is why the Talmud assumes that a virgin cannot conceive on her first act of sexual intercourse if the hymen is actually penetrable and modern-day observations have proven that a women can indeed conceive then?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I wonder if it might just be a matter of timing. The egg lives for only a maximum of 24 hours or so after ovulation, and sperm also are fertile for only a couple of days. Now, a woman might get married, and have her first act of intercourse with her husband, anytime during the tahor part of her cycle (and, according to the original Torah law, that would be 3 out of every 4 weeks), so the chance of this occurring close to her ovulation would be relatively low. During the rest of her married life, on the other hand, there's a much higher chance that they'll have relations at (or close to) her fertile time.</p>\n\n<p>So this could indeed be expressed as the statistical fact that conception after first intercourse is much less likely (although, granted, not impossible). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_of_Gerona\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nissim of Gerona</a> actually says that this statement refers to the majority of women, (Alfasi on Yeb. 6a, end of ד\"ה גרסי , beginning on 5b)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.dafdigest.org/Yevamos/Yevamos%20034.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf Yomi Digest</a> writes that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Noda B’Yehudah writes in his responsa נודע יהודה קמא אה\"ע סימן כ\"ב that nowadays it is possible for women to become pregnant the first time they have relations. Furthermore, even in the time of Chazal the principle did not indicate that it was impossible for a woman to become pregnant the first time she had relations, rather the principle was stated with regards to the majority. The majority of women would not become pregnant the first time they had relations, but there was always a minority of women who would become pregnant the first time they had relations. This approach was followed by Rav Moshe Sofer, the Chasam Sofer in his responsa אה\"ע חלק א סימן ו.</p>\n<p>Others - שו\"ת תשורת ש\"י מהדו\"ת סימן ע\"ב, שו\"ת מהרש\"ם חלק ד סימן ע - write that in the time of Chazal the principle was absolute and the nature of people has changed (נשתנו הטבעים), which now allows women to become pregnant the first time they have relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi (Breshit 19:36) points out that Lot's daughters got pregnant on the first act of intercourse  even if it doesn't generally happen.

First of all, he says, if you say the two berachos back-to-back, then then one of those berachos is unnecessary. Second, even if you put the tallis katan and tallis gadol on at different times (and say the two berachos separately), the tallis katan may not be suitable for saying a berachah on anyway: it might be closed too far up the sides, or too small, or you might have slept in it.</p>\n\n<p>See also Dayan Raskin's <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30450&hilite=c1daaf35-f918-4152-b83d-9ccda8bb08de&st=%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%AA&pgnum=89\" rel=\"nofollow\">notes to the Rav's siddur</a>, that another good reason for this practice is because one may put on the tallis katan while his hands are still unclean (before washing negel vasser), or before daybreak.

Chazon Ish responded by claiming that nishtaneh hateva, people have evolved. Rav Moshe Shapiro disputed this and also vehemently objected to the notion that any Torah scholar could ever have been mistaken about the physical reality.

After all, if one refuses to acknowledge that Chazal possessed incomplete knowledge of the natural world, and one refuses to say nishtaneh hateva, then what does one do with, for example, the Gemara which says that one can violate Shabbos to save the life of a fetus born after seven months, but not one born after eight months?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The author quotes sources from the gemara and ge'onim in which they count years this way. However, he concludes that this wasn't the common way to count years at the time. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azariah_dei_Rossi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azaryah Min HaAdumim</a> was the first the cast doubts on the age of this dating system; he writes that it probably originated either sometime after Rabbi Hilel HaNasi (4119/670) or after Rav Sherira Ga'on (~4350/900).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p><strong>The answer: we started counting Hebrew years in תש\"ח - 1948.</strong>\n<em>My answer is completely unsourced, but based on my little research on Masechet Rosh Hashanah.</em></p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that <strong>the State of Israel is the first time in the history of the Jewish people, when the years from Creation are publicly and officially <em>COUNTED</em></strong> (as opposed to CALCULATED).

However, in my humble understanding, <strong>NEVER in the history of Judaism this calendar was publicly and unanimously accepted</strong>. Sages throughout the ages kept different traditions of calculating the timeline, but never really \"COUNTED\". Maybe, because <strong>there's no Mitzvah of announcing the year</strong>, for example, on Rosh Hashana. There's no obligation to use then in contracts between Jews, so those years in dates served only as \"secondary\" to secular counting.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps a bit.</p>\n\n\n",

Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The standard grammatical rule is that a word whose first vowel is a segol gets converted to a komotz when that word ends a sentence (or at an etnachta, which functions like a semicolon). This is a verse that ends with \"lechem\", so it becomes \"lachem.\" </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Vayeitzei begins that Yaakov left from Be'er Shava. (Would have been <em>Sheva</em>, but it's at the end of a clause). \"Ato\" (patach-komotz) for \"you\" becomes \"oto\" (komotz-komotz) throughout the siddur (look especially at shemoneh esrei) where it ends a clause or sentence.</p>\n\n<p>To elaborate on that:</p>\n\n<p>There are, if my computer-script counted properly, 44 “oto”s in Tanach, vs. 560-\nsomething “ato”s (so the komotz accounts for about 7% total, or 1 komotz per 13 patachs).\nNote also that as far as I can tell, if it's “you are adjective”, the stress is on the last syllable. If it's “adjective are you”, it's on the first syllable. All komotz cases (because they end the clause) are mil'el (stress on the first syllable), but the patach form is also occasionally mil'el, e.g. (but not limited to) a zakef katon.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/329Ga.jpg\" alt=\"Verse illustrating\"></p>\n\n<p>First instance of \"you\" with a komotz is Genesis 3:10:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/am2lc.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis 3:10 with vowels\"></p>\n\n<p>Here's Isaiah's prayer, paraphrased in the siddur but maintaining the relevant vowelization:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XXVHu.jpg\" alt=\"Isaiah verse\"></p>\n\n<p>And a verse from the Zachor Haftarah, containing two forms of \"you\" according to the usage described here:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xdWIK.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel verse\"></p>\n\n<p>Of course, Psalms, Proverbs, and Job employ a different cantillation system, so what defines a partial or full stop there is quite different.</p>\n\n\n",

I was also advised (when I asked someone else several months later) that it is not possible to make it up afterwards - in case you were wondering.  I believe the reason for the latter point is that it is a Berachah HaSemuchah LeḤavertah.

It seems it may 'mess up' the number of 7 total brachos they instituted for shema.

This is so even when their recorded prophecies tie in with historical events described in the Book of Kings - indeed, for example, there are a couple of chapters of Isaiah (36-39) that are repeated almost verbatim in II Kings (18-20), and similarly with Jer. 52 as compared with II Kings 25.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the prophets before that - even those about whom we have fairly substantial information, notably Eliyahu and Elisha - have their prophecies and actions simply interspersed with the annals of the contemporary kings of Yehudah and Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14367&st=&pgnum=6\">Abarbanel</a> discusses why all <em>nevuos</em>, including those of Yeshayahu, Yirmiyahu, etc., are not written in their historical context in Melachim or elsewhere. For that matter, why a separate book for Tehillim and Mishlei? Why not just include them with the stories of David and Shlomo?</p>\n\n<p>I will not post his entire discussion here, but the gist of it is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It would make things difficult for readers, having, for example, Megillas Koheles in the middle of stories of Shlomo's life.</li>\n<li>We include in the historical books (Neviim Rishonim) only what is relevant to the life and times of the subject of the book. Whatever <em>nevuos</em> were not relevant to the stories of the kings we are involved with in Melachim were not included within.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, why do Yeshayahu and Yirmiyahu have their own books with collections of their <em>nevuos</em>, but Eliyahu and Elisha do not? Does this mean that Eliyahu and Elisha, and for that matter, Gad HaChozeh, Nassan HaNavi and others, did not prophesy besides what is written in Melachim? Perhaps. But <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14368&st=&pgnum=13\">Abarbanel</a> offers another clue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכלל אחד אתן בידך יהיה לך מפתח גדול בהבנת הנבואות האלה והוא שרוב הנביאים האלה נבאו על הגאולה העתידה לפי שמפני רחוקה וארך הגלות יהיו בני אדם מתיאשים ממנה ולכך הוצרך יתברך להעמיד נביאים רבים מיעדים ומבטיחים עליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, specific <em>neviim</em> were chosen to have their prophesies compiled and included in Tanach because they are relevant to the <em>galus</em> that we are currently enduring. Other <em>neviim</em> may have had scores of prophesies as well, but they were not as important for the survival of the nation.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, why are there narratives included in Yeshayahu and Yirmiyahu that are related almost exactly the same in Melachim? I would say that each <em>sefer</em> was written with a different purpose. Melachim was written to tell of the events relating to the kings of Israel. Yeshayahu was written to deliver the <em>nevuos</em> of Yeshayahu. If a story is told in both, it is relevant both to the stories of the kings and to the life and prophesies of Yeshayahu.</p>\n\n\n",

David, then, was in the latter category during this period.)</p>\n\n<p>After Shaul's death, David was indeed a king, just that at first he ruled only the tribe of Yehudah (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15862#v=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">II Sam. 2:4</a>), with Ish Boshes ruling over the other tribes for part or all of this period (see commentaries ibid. 2:10-11). We find that the later kings of Yisrael vs. Yehudah were considered coequal for halachic purposes (Yerushalmi, Horios 3:2), so presumably the same would have applied to David and Ish Boshes: each was a king within his own sphere of influence (thus not violating the rule about \"one kingship overlapping the other\"). At any rate, the seven and a half years before the rest of the tribes accepted David as king are counted towards the total length of his reign (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15865#v=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">II Sam. 5:5</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15886#v=11\" rel=\"nofollow\">I Kings 2:11</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>What about the fact that it is possible that David was king of ONLY Judah for 2 years and then remained in Hevron but was king over all of Israel for 5.5 more years before moving to Jerusalem? </p>\n\n<p>This seems like a likely idea given that Ish Boshet did not make a very good king and needed Avner to keep his kingship.

I was taught that this was on account of the fact that the talmidei chachamim didn't advocate the return as they sensed that this was not the final geula, as Beis Sheini wasn't built to the specifications of Yechezkel. Is this so, is this what they held? </p>\n\n<p>Wouldn't there be more than enough reason for them to make aliyah? Even if it wasn't the final Beis Hamikdash, it was still <em>the</em> Beis Hamikdash, and the only way to remove tumah was there, not in Bavel.

Of all the places they could have gone to, they were exiled to a place where they spoke the language and were able to communicate with other people already there. That had a big impact on a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to consider is that although the second temple was built, many rabbis knew that this was also temporary. There is an injunction that if you're about to plant a seedling when someone comes to tell you that the Messiah has come, you should plant the seedling first. Jews have been very wary about following one leader en masse (even Moses only managed to convince a small portion of Jews to leave Egypt with him; the rest died during the plague of darkness), and even more so when they knew the final redemption was not yet here. </p>\n\n<p>I think the main criteria for a lot of major Jewish personalities of the time was that they should settle in Bavel, and still give honor to the temple while it stands. The gemara is replete with stories of rabbis who traveled to or from Israel to relate a teaching from one group of rabbis to another. If being around the temple was the ONLY major reason for them to be in Israel, then it could be asked why so many Jews simply didn't go up.</p>\n\n\n",

The Neviim prophesized to their generations based on the needs of the time. When the people sinned, when things needed changing, the Navi was there to rebuke them and direct them. Like Alex quoted from Nedarim, there would be no need for the Neviim had the people not sinned, b/c there wouldn't be what to rebuke. I don't think these are hinted to in the Torah. However, ethical teachings, ways of life, that is hinted to in the Torah or at least the principles can be inferred from the Torah's laws and guidelines.</p>\n\n\n",

The same is true for <em>bone (b'rachamav) Y'rushalayim</em> after a meal and the final <em>b'racha</em> of <em>Halel</em> and <em>p'suke d'zimra</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, <em>SA OC</em> 215:1 has that we say <em>amen</em> to our own <em>b'racha</em> in each of these cases even <em>without</em> hearing someone else simultaneously, and I believe <em>S'faradim</em> follow this rule. <em>Rama</em> there limits that rule to <em>bone Y'rushalayim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <em>Rama</em> there does not discuss the case of finishing the other <em>b'rachos</em> — <em>Hashkivenu</em> et al. — simultaneously with another's <em>b'racha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> :4 notes that the <em>Rama</em>'s limiting to <em>bone Y'rushalayim</em> is because that that's the only <em>b'racha</em> on which one <em>must</em> answer <em>amen</em> to his own (so as to differentiate the <em>d'oraysa</em> three <em>b'rachos</em> from the fourth): we don't answer <em>amen</em> to our own <em>Hashkivenu</em> et al. (where it's permitted but not required to do so) so as to lend more oomph to the differentiation afforded by answering <em>bone</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>AHS</em> supplies us, perhaps, with the reason answering one's own <em>bone Y'rushalayim</em> (and the others) is appropriate when hearing another's <em>b'racha</em> simultaneously. Since there's really nothing wrong with doing so (as there usually is when finishing a <em>b'racha</em> oneself), it's appropriate when one's heard someone else's <em>b'racha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As to why the last blessing in a series has the you-may-answer-your-own rule, I don't know.</p>\n\n\n",

This gives an opportunity for another Mitzvah: Shlom Bait. Generally the husband got the tallit as the first present from his wife (then she was his bride).

(If the אם clause was parenthetical - \"It will be, if you don't like her, that you shall send her away\" - then that's like any other conditional, not a certainty. By contrast, if we translate, \"It will be that if you don't like her, then you shall send her away\" - that brings out more clearly that the \"if you don't like her\" is a guaranteed outcome (\"it will be\").)</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%95_%D7%98%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zech. 6:15</a> the usual order is inverted, with the result (\"People from far away will come and build Hashem's palace...\") preceding the condition (\"והיה אם you listen to the voice of Hashem your G-d\"). The commentaries there say that והיה refers back to the first half of the sentence - i.e., \"People from far away will come..., if you listen...\" Which would make the condition parenthetical, as in the JPS translation of the verses in Shemos. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, though, it probably does make more sense to assume that והיה covers both halves of the sentence. This would contrast with verses in which אם precedes והיה, like <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%91_%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen. 32:9</a> and <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lev. 25:28</a>.

Here, by contrast, the outcome (והאמינו לקל האת האחרון or ולקחת ממימי היאר) is introduced with a ו, as are other places where you have \"והיה X, then Y.\" This seems to me, then, to indicate that in this case the outcome is not a continuation of והיה, but of the condition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><code>והיה</code> is <code>and it was</code> in simple translation.\nBut in the Bible language, (an antique language), it is exactly like - <code>if</code> !!!</p>\n\n<p>I mean:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>והיה אם=IF   /     and it was that if = IF\n</code></pre>\n\n\n",

Assuming that David was the author of at least most of the psalms would imply that he had at least some form of prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, though, we don't ever find that God \"spoke\" to David as he did to other prophets. In fact, when God wanted to give David a direct message, it was sent either by Gad HaChozeh or Nassan HaNavi. This implies that David himself, at least at that time, was not a navi.</p>\n\n<p>As @msh210 pointed out, Chazal count David in their list of Neviim.

It is there in Ibn Ezra's introduction that you will find a list of sources in which the scipture \"suggests\" that David indeed was a navi. (The context there is actually sources that imply David as the author of all of Tehillim.) To give you the first couple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"כִּי כֵן מִצְוַת דָּוִיד אִישׁ הָאֱלֹהִים\" [A description we find only by neviim.] (II Divrei Hayamim 8:14)</li>\n<li>\"רוּחַ יְהוָה דִּבֶּר בִּי וּמִלָּתוֹ עַל לְשׁוֹנִי\" (II Shmuel 23:2)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See Ibn Ezra there; also <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49157&st=&pgnum=14\">Radak</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38172&st=&pgnum=17\">Meiri</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Whether David was a navi seems to be a machloket between the Rambam in his earlier writings and the Rambam in his later writings. In Shmonah Perakim, the Rambam's introduction to Avot, ch. 7, he counts Shlomo and David as Nevi'im. However, in the Moreh Nevuchim, II:45, he says that they were not nevi'im but possessors of ruach ha-kodesh. On the other hand, both Rashi and Rabbenu Chananel in Megillah 14a list David as a navi (even if R. Chananel doesn't count Shlomo).</p>\n<p>The Rambam also adduces various proofs, e.g., in the <a href=\"http://press.tau.ac.il/perplexed/chapters/chap_2_45.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh</a>, he counters an argument from שמואל ב', כ\"ג, ג (which he actually quotes as a proof in his introduction to Avot):\nואילו דברי דוד: אמר אלהי ישֹראל, לי דִבר צור ישֹראל, משמעותם שהוא הבטיח לו על-ידי נביא, או נתן או זולתו, כמו ויאמר ה' לה</p>\n<p>See also the notes in the Machon ha-Maor edition of Perush ha-Mishnah for more sources in the Rambam on both sides.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It wasn't said clearly here but the difference is pretty negligible. We find on 3a in megillah that even Daniel is not called a Navi despite many clear ( and unclear) prophecies. Navi is \"lashon dibbur\" saying it over. Daniel was not commanded to do so. Mathematical formula ;Navi is roughly equal to prophet ( don't have sign on my phone). Similarly , was David only supposed to write his prophecy or also say it over.

    "content": "# Why do divorced or widowed women still need to cover their hair?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was recently reading the <a href=\"http://www.thehalacha.com/attach/Volume7/haircovering.pdf\">latest edition</a> of Halachically Speaking. It says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A woman who is a widow r”l or divorcee still has an obligation to cover her hair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But why is this so? Why should they be any different than unmarried women?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Presumably standard practice is that once a woman begins treating her hair as <em>erva</em>, she should continue doing so. (I believe I've heard this from Rabbis Broyde or Willig.)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein does write that hair-covering while married is <em>dat moshe</em>, but hair-covering afterwards is <em>dat yehudit</em>. There is a great deal of discussion over what those terms mean, but most straightforward is the argument of Rabbi Yehuda Henkin, Rabbi Michael Broyde, and others that the former is completely objective, but the latter may have some cultural dependence.</p>\n<p>(By the way, why do unmarried women not have to cover their hair? It appears their definition of <em>erva</em> is culturally subjective, hence not today.)</p>\n<p>The obligation of hair-covering post-marriage is less than during marriage; thus (as indicated by rony), in one responsum Rabbi Moshe Feinstein allowed a young widow to uncover her hair as that was needed for her employment in an office (which sounds a bit like the <em>Mad Men</em> era, but I digress). In another responsum -- <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=921&pgnum=72\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH4:32.4</a> --, he allows a young divorcee to uncover her hair to increase the likelihood of meeting an eligible fellow. There are actually two reasons why this is helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbi Feinstein is concerned that a man may be so ideologically opposed to marrying a divorcee that he'd never talk with a hair-covered woman to begin with; but if she looked never-married, he'd make conversation with her, and then by the second or third date she'd reveal her background, but by then he'd think of her as a whole person and not a theoretical category.</li>\n<li>More simply, if I'm a single guy at a kiddush, wedding, or other social event, I'm not going to approach random pretty lady wearing a hair-covering -- she's probably married!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a very (extremely?) delicate subject. We must first understand what stands behind it and this forum may not be the best place to discuss it. The idea of \"tzniut\" is very deep and comes to help us build a meaningful and lasting married relationship. The chinuch (training? education?) starts at a very young age much before the boy/girl gets to the age of marrying. There are different customs depending on the congregations. I am happy that I don't have to be a posek in this subject!\nThe source to cover the hair for married window is deHoraitah (Shulchan Haruch Even Haezer 21:2) and according to the commentators it includes even divorced and widows.\nHarav Feinshtein was asked on the subject (Igrot Moshe, Even Haezer 1:57) regarding if the widow or the divorced may loose her place of work if she comes with her hair covered. He said that in the case of need she can go with her hair uncovered. What is \"case of need\"?\nWhat about a situation of a young widow that hopes to re-marry and feels that is she goes with her covered it will decrease her chances? </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While this question already has an accepted answer, I feel there is some information missing from it, hence my post.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the question assumes that hair covering should only apply to a woman who is married. This assumption is warranted, as the gemarra in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=72&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 72a</a> teaches</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ראשה פרוע דאורייתא היא דכתיב (במדבר ה, יח) ופרע את ראש האשה ותנא דבי רבי ישמעאל אזהרה לבנות ישראל שלא יצאו בפרוע ראש</p>\n  \n  <p>A woman with an uncovered head [transgresses] a biblical injunction, as it is written: \"And he shall uncover the head of the woman\", and a Tannah from the Academy of Rabbi Yishmael taught: This is a prohibition to the daughters of Israel that they should not go out with an uncovered head</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The verse used to derive this prohibition is from the Sotah ritual, which involves a suspected adulteress (see the two explanations of Rashi there for how the gemarra derives this). Only a married woman could be a Sotah, therefore it would make sense that only a married woman should have her hair uncovered.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Based on the above, Rav Moshe Feinstein in Igros Moshe, Even HaEzer Volume 1 Simman 57 writes the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שגם אלמנה אסורה ללכת פרועת ראש הוא רק מצד דת יהודית דמדאורייתא הא רק בא\"א נאמר</p>\n  \n  <p>Even [though] a widow is prohibited to have an uncovered head, that is just from the law of Das Yehudis, since from on a Biblical level this injunction was only stated regarding a married woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says it's only Das Yehudis, which is <strong>a prohibition on a Rabbinic level</strong>. He wants to use this, using one of the explanations in Rashi to allow a widow to have an uncovered head if there is a great financial loss involved. He even adds at the end:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש גם לומר שאולי <strong>דת יהודית הוא רק מדיני מנהג</strong> שאין לאסור באופן שלא מצינו שנהגו ובמקום הפסד הא לא מצינו שנהגו </p>\n  \n  <p>You can even say that perhaps this Das Yehudis [prohibition] is <strong>only at the level of a minhag (custom)</strong>, which shouldn't prohibit in a situation where we haven't seen people follow it. [Therefore] in a case of loss, we haven't seen people follow it (to cover their head).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Berkovits\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchok Berkowitz</a> (in a shiur I heard) is astounded at Rav Moshe for failing to mention the opinions of the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7158\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bach</a> (ד\"ה לא ילכו) and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7593\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vilna Gaon</a> (Seif Kattan 11) to Even HaEzer Simman 21 that a widow/divorced woman<sup>1</sup> has to cover her hair at a <strong>biblical level</strong>. They derive it from the gemarra's choice of language אסור לבנות ישראל, the daughters of Israel, instead of saying אסור לאשת איש, a married woman.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Rav Moshe does have a point. Sotah is only talking about a married woman. Therefore Rav Berkowitz suggests that the Bach and Vilna Gaon understand the drash of Chazal to either (a) be a gezeiras hakasuv (decree of the writ), or (b) a <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/gemara/the-13-rules-of-rabbi-yishmael/methodology3/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">binyan av</a>. He feels a gezeiras hakasuv is a bigger chiddush (novelty), so therefore he takes the approach of a binyan av. How can we understand this binyan av? </p>\n\n<p>He says that the Torah obligates a woman who has reached a certain social status to wear something that shows that status, and the Torah objectively chose a head covering. A woman who is married is not the same as a single woman. Once a woman is no longer married, she doesn't revert to being a young single girl again. She's still the wise <em>balabusta</em> everyone seeks advice from. Therefore, even a widow/divorced woman should cover her hair.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. Note the Tur and SA specifically say a <strong>single</strong> or married girl has to cover their hair. While a widow/divorced woman is in fact now single, the term single doesn't exclusively mean someone previously married. The Bach quotes the Mordechai that hair we're used to seeing doesn't need to be covered, and assumes that's talking about a virgin. Therefore it would sound like the Bach is talking about <strong>anyone</strong> who isn't a virgin, whether they were married or not, has to cover their hair based on this drash. However, Rav Berkowitz understands that the Bach and Vilna Gaon are only talking about a woman who was previously married.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# בָּא אֵלַי הַפָּלִיט מִירוּשָׁלַ‍ִם ... How late was he?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Yechezkel 33:21:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִי בִּשְׁתֵּי עֶשְׂרֵה שָׁנָה בָּעֲשִׂרִי בַּחֲמִשָּׁה לַחֹדֶשׁ לְגָלוּתֵנוּ בָּא אֵלַי הַפָּלִיט מִירוּשָׁלַ‍ִם לֵאמֹר הֻכְּתָה הָעִיר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, on the Fifth of Teves of the twelfth year of Yechezkel's (Yehoyachin's) exile, the messenger came to Yechezkel, telling him of the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>Radak is puzzled:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מ\"מ יש לתמוה איך לא הגיע השמועה עד חמשה חדשים מן החורבן </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Abarbanel as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה העיר הוכתה בחדש החמישי שהוא חודש אב בתשיעי ובעשירי בו ואיך יתכן שלא שמעו בבבל ראש מלכות נבוכד נצר הצלחתו ונצחונו עד החדש העשירי מהשנה האחרת שהוא זמן חמשה חדשים בקירוב כי הנה מירושלם עד בבל ילכו צירים רצים בחדש ימים ובפחות מזה להגיד בשורה טובה לכשדיים כזאת ואיך נתעכבה חמשה חדשים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Radak gives an answer that maybe the army with the exiles took a detour through another country to capture it before heading back to Bavel. Abarbanel gives his answer that the months are counted \"לְגָלוּתֵנוּ\", which was in Kislev, so it really was only a month after the <em>churban</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But wait a second...Five months? Nevuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem in the <strong>eleventh</strong> year of Tzidkiyahu's reign, which would be the eleventh year of Yehoyachin's exile. If so, then this episode, which is \"בִּשְׁתֵּי עֶשְׂרֵה שָׁנָה ... לְגָלוּתֵנוּ\" is actually <strong><em>seventeen</em></strong> months after the destruction of Jerusalem, in which case Abarbanel's answer won't work and Radak's is extremely far-fetched.</p>\n\n<p>The question is: How is my timeline off and really the messenger <em>was</em> just five months late, like Radak concludes and like Abarbanel originally assumes. [And according to Abarbanel's conclusion, why was the messenger just one month late and not thirteen?] And if my timeline is not off, how do we answer the question of why the messenger came 17 months later?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On 40:1 (where Yechezkel's prophecy is dated \"the 25th year of our exile, on Rosh Hashanah, the tenth of the month, in the 14th year after the city was destroyed\"), Abarbanel <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14369&pgnum=585\" rel=\"nofollow\">argues</a> that \"Rosh Hashanah\" can mean anniversary of the exile. So according to him, at least, not only the months but also the years לגלותנו may indeed be counted consistently from Kislev. (In fact, if we were to assume that the years of this era are counted from Nissan, we would have a problem: that exile occurred in 3327, and the Beis Hamikdash was destroyed on Tisha B'Av 3338. If Year 1 לגלותנו runs from Nissan 3326-Adar 3327, then the twelfth year of that era would end in Adar 3338 - five months <strong>before</strong> the Destruction. That said, it would work out equally well if this era's years begin with Tishrei.)</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Gemara (Erachin 12a) understands 40:1 to be talking about the 10th of Tishrei, and on this basis identifies it as a Yovel year, whose observances take effect on Yom Kippur. Rambam (Hil. Shemittah VeYovel 10:3), on the basis of the discussion in the Gemara there, places the Destruction in the 36th year of the Yovel period, meaning that the last Yovel before the Destruction was in 3302; since a Yovel occurs (according to the Sages) every 50 years, then Yechezkel received this prophecy on 10 Tishrei 3352. Let's take both possibilities, then:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the years לגלותנו run from Tishrei to Elul, then 3352 = 25, making 3328 the first year of that era. 3338, the year of the Destruction, would be the 11th year; the following 5 Teves would be already in the 12th year. There's your five months. (The problem with this is that Yehoyachin's exile was in 3327, so why isn't that year counted as part of this era?)</p></li>\n<li><p>If they run from Nissan to Adar, then year 25 began on 1 Nissan 3351, so year 1 began on 1 Nissan 3327. (We would have to assume, contrary to Abarbanel, that Yehoyachin's exile was sometime between Nissan and Elul.) Year 12 would run from 1 Nissan 3338 to 29 Adar 3339; again, 5 Teves of the 12th year comes out five months after the Destruction.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Either way, though, that still leaves us with the problem of dating Tzidkiyahu's reign. The Destruction occurred in his 11th year (Jer. 39:2 and 52:5); since this corresponds to 3338, then his first year would have had to begin in Nissan 3328 (or Tishrei of that year, if for some reason his regnal years were counted from Tishrei). If Yehoyachin was exiled sometime in 3327, what happened during the interim?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The year changes on the 1st of Tishrei as that is the new year for counting years. (Mishna, Rosh Hashana 1:1)  It doesn't matter if you start an event on the 30th of Elul, when Tishrei comes around its the next \"year\".  Av was the 11th year, Elul was the 11th year, Tishrei is the 12th year, Cheshvan is the 12th year, Kislev was the 12th year, and then Tevet was the 12th year.</p>\n\n<p>That's 5 months later.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does cheese without a hekhsher tref dishes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard that Rav Soloveitchik ztz\"l used to eat non-hekhshered cheese. Can you explain how the creation of hashgachah agencies has changed whether things need hashgachah, and would it be reasonable to argue that plain, non-hekhshered cheese (without added things in it like peppers) may be asur l'akhilah but doesn't actually tref dishes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is not a question of \"does product X require certification\", it's much more complex than that.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara says that \"cheeses of non-Jews\" are non-kosher. The prevailing opinion is that out of concern for intermarriage, the rabbis absolutely prohibited all cheese if the milk was owned by non-Jews at the time of curdling, or if the rennet was added by non-Jews. Any kosher cheese certified by OU,cRc,Star-K, and the like today was owned and curdled by Jews.</p>\n\n<p>There had been another interpretation of that Gemara that it was a concern regarding the rennet's animal origins. But many mass-produced cheeses today use microbial rennet or the like. Hence, anecdote has it that when kosher cheese was unavailable in his early years in Boston, Rabbi Soloveichik followed this interpretation and ate cheese that definitely did not contain animal rennet.</p>\n\n<p>May I note that Rabbi Soloveichik was a brilliant Talmudic theoretician, whose school of thought was often to follow whichever longstanding interpretation he felt was most correct, even if it was viewed as more of a minority opinion by most. (For instance, the standard of Shulchan Aruch is that the visitor follows the practices of his hometown vis-a-vis second day of yomtov. This is the opinion taken for granted by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein among many others, and if anyone asked me, that's what I'd tell them too. Rabbi Soloveichik felt that R' Yaakov Emden's dramatic reinterpretation (visitor follows current locale) was correct, but also adopted some stringencies of the better-regarded interpretation, out of respect.) </p>\n\n<p>So your question isn't \"if a non-certified product falls into a mixture, how (un)certain am I that it contained non-kosher ingredients.\" It's \"now that we follow the prevailing view of the rabbinic prohibition on non-kosher cheese, is there any room to follow other views in rare occasions ex post facto\"? My sense on that is that once majority opinion codified into halacha that all cheese made by non-Jews is non-kosher, we treat it was any other rabbinically-prohibited foodstuff for all intents and purposes.</p>\n\n\n",

Though it is clearly intended to make Yitzchak think that Yaakov was actually Eisav, it is still unsettling that Yaakov (who is often thought to be the paradigm of truth) could lie like that.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Rashi gives his interpretation of how to read Yaakov's words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנכי המביא לך ועשו הוא בכורך</p>\n<p>I am [the one who is bringing your food and] Eisav [is] your firstborn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This does seem a little stretched, though, and thus I give you the answer of Abarbanel and Alshich who interpret his words: \"I am your firtsborn, Eisav\", that is, I <strong>represent the position of</strong> Eisav, your firstborn, ever since he sold to me the <em>bechora</em>; since then <strong>I am him</strong> regarding all things relating to the <em>bechora</em> (including the <em>b'rachos</em>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have no source, but I have always learned as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, the main issue with lying has less to do with the words you use and more to do with the message you are conveying.

On the other hand, if you have $5 in your pocket and say \"I don't have any money on me\" because you need that $5, you have not conveyed sheker.</p>\n\n<p>However, a higher level of midvar sheker tirchak would oblige you to use words which are true as well, even though you are already conveying emes.

He knew that there was something to be learned from the redundancy, but he wasn't sure what it was. Being that Rashi got much of his material from midrashic sources, chances are he just wasn't able to find a midrash addressing this fact.</p>\n\n<p>As to what the reason is behind the Torah mentioning that Rivka was the mother of Yaakov and Eisav, this is one of those things that you get to see the style of a commentary based on how they address this problem. Personally, I am most fluent in the commentary of Abarbanel, so I will give you his answer. Perhaps others can supplement with other answers.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah here wants to emphasize the fact that Yaakov went to Aram, not because he was fleeing from Eisav's wrath, but rather just to find a wife. Thus, it shows that Yaakov was not travelling to a place where Eisav could not follow. Yaakov's relation to Lavan and family was equal to Eisav's, that is, he was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לָבָן בֶּן בְּתוּאֵל הָאֲרַמִּי אֲחִי רִבְקָה אֵם יַעֲקֹב וְעֵשָׂו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Eisav had just as much opportunity to go visit there as Yaakov did.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19148&st=&pgnum=61\">Maskil LeDavid on the verse</a> brings a fascinating explanation. </p>\n\n<p>He says Rashi is explaining what Yitzchok was telling Yaakov. Yitzchok told Yaakov, I'm sending you to Lavan, but be careful, since I don't know what kind of man he is (i.e. Tzaddik or Rasha). Normally we can tell the nature of an uncle by looking at the majority of his nephews, but I have two sons, one righteous and one wicked, so there is no majority, and therefore it could go either way.</p>\n\n<p>This then, is how to read Rashi: Rivka is the Mother of Yaakov and Eisav, and therefore I don't know what Lavan's nature is. This is what the Passuk is coming to teach us.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14294&st=&pgnum=137\">Siftei Chachamim writes</a> that Rashi was aware of the many interpretations by various commentaries, but he wasn't sure which one was correct according to the simple meaning of the verse.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe, based on his thesis that Rashi is only coming to explain the simple meaning of the verse (and only quotes Midrashim that can be used to explain the simple meaning), says (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14928&st=&pgnum=13\">Likutei Sichot volume 5, pg 1 footnote 2</a>) that when Rashi says, \"I don't know\", it isn't because he is not aware of any of the answers given, but rather is not aware of any answer that explains the simple meaning of the verse.</p>\n\n<p>This also explains why there are some instances where Rashi gives an explanation in his commentary on the Talmud, but says I don't know in his commentary on the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>[See there for a list of locations where Rashi says \"I don't know\" or something similar, including places where Rashi says \"I don't know\" and then proceeds to give a reason.]</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rashi is studied by trying first to understand \"what is bothering Rashi?\". This means that every perush was motivated by a question he had or something that was not completely clear. There are some situations, like this one, in which Rashi felt he couldn't provide the answer. But still there is a question and he wanted to bring it before us. </p>\n\n\n",

From when he goes out of his mother.</p>\n\n<p>If so, why was Eisav struggling to get out to the house of Idol Worship? According to this Gemara he had no Evil Inclination yet?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשהיתה עוברת על פתחי תורה של שם ועבר יעקב רץ ומפרכס לצאת, וכשהיתה עוברת על פתחי עבודה זרה עשיו מפרכס לצאת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What? Fetuses (is it feti?) can think on their own? They can sense what is on the outside? They are attracted by worldly desire? Clearly this <em>midrash</em> is not to be taken literally.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the idea this midrash is trying to convey is that Eisav was \"destined\" to be enticed by the desires this world has to offer, as if he was born to fit the role of the sinner.</p>\n\n<p>The real question here is one that many a great mind have grappled with: How can God limit Eisav's free will? But that is a different question.</p>\n\n<p>As to what the verse \"וַיִּתְרֹצֲצוּ הַבָּנִים בְּקִרְבָּהּ\" actually means on a <em>p'shat</em> level, perhaps it was just a natural \"twins kicking in the womb\" phenomenon, maybe in order to get Rivka to seek the word of a navi, as she did.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Note that the expression in Sanhedrin there is שולט - dominates. Antoninus (and Rebbi) might well agree that the evil inclination exists in utero, just that a person doesn't begin to act on it until birth.</p>\n<p>R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi makes a similar point in Tanya, ch. 13. Having previously explained that a <em>benoni</em> is a person who has two equally active inclinations, to good and to evil, but who always ends up doing the right thing (as contrasted with the <em>tzaddik</em>, who has completely sublimated or even transformed his evil inclination, and the <em>rasha</em>, who to a greater or lesser extent does evil), he writes (translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028917/jewish/Chapter-13.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therewith will be understood the commentary of our Sages that \"'Intermediate' people are judged by both [the good and evil natures], for it is written, 'He stands at the right hand of the poor man, to save him from them that judge his soul.'\" Note that they did not say \"ruled\" by both, G-d forbid, because where the evil nature gains any control and dominion over the \"small city,\" even though but temporarily, one is at such times deemed \"wicked.\"</p>\n<p>The evil nature [in the <em>benoni</em>], however, is no more than, for example, a magistrate or judge who gives his opinion on a point of law, yet it is not necessarily a final decision to be implemented in deed, for there is another magistrate or judge who is contesting this opinion. It is, therefore, necessary to arbitrate between the two, and the final verdict rests with the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the evil nature states its opinion in the left part of the heart, which thence ascends to the brain for contemplation. Immediately it is challenged by the second judge, the divine soul in the brain extending into the right part of the heart, the abode of the good nature. The final verdict comes from the arbitrator—the Holy One, blessed be He, who comes to the aid of the good nature, as our Sages said, \"If the Almighty did not help him, he could not overcome his evil inclination.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Eisav's evil inclination was asserting itself, as was Yaakov's good inclination, but it was no more than that - an assertion. Things could still have gone either way with each of them once they were born. More to the point: granted perhaps that Yaakov was given the power to be a tzaddik and Eisav was not, yet Eisav could have become the ultimate <em>benoni</em> - whose service of Hashem in the teeth of the challenge posed by the evil inclination, as R. Shneur Zalman goes on to explain (in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028984/jewish/Chapter-27.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch. 27</a>), gives Him tremendous pleasure.</p>\n<p>(There is also this to consider: each one's \"running and struggling to get out\" might itself have indicated one of two things. At a shul, for example, it might mean that the baby is naturally drawn towards its holiness, but it equally well might mean the opposite - that he desperately wants to get out and torch the place! Same thing, lehavdil, at an idolatrous temple. So Eisav's eagerness to get out when Rivkah passed the latter kind of place need not have been evidence of wicked tendencies - on the contrary, it could have meant that he has a powerful natural inclination to fight against idolatry, like his grandfather Avraham.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>An answer based on Rabbi Hirsch's approach -- that I heard from Rabbi Francis Nataf -- is that people are born with temperaments, how they're channeled is their decision.</p>\n\n<p>Esav's nature was to be a loose cannon; Yaakov's, to be quiet and studious. It wasn't that prenatal Esav was attracted to idolatry per se, he was attracted to the way it was being performed. A really rocking Purim party would have done it for him just as well. Prenatal Yaakov was attracted to a yeshiva, but he would have been equally attracted to a medieval university.</p>\n\n\n",

That's how there's balance in the world.

Fine. But as we're humans, it doesn't work 100% of the time. It can't. When a brilliant charlatan \"discovered\" some long-lost volumes of the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/rygb/Y-Kodashim.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">pdf</a>), many rabbis were skeptical -- but the Chafetz Chaim was fooled.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in the last chapter of Pesachim talks about certain things the way the world works; despite fancy technology, these are all still fundamentals of human civilization.

However, he figured that this could be accomplished by blessing Eisav, thereby infusing into him a powerful Divine \"light\" that would sweep up all of these \"sparks\" with it. The problem was that Eisav was totally unsuited for this, so if he had tried to carry out this plan, one of two things would happen: either this Divine energy would have been assimilated into Eisav's unholiness and been wasted, or it would have completely overwhelmed him.

    "content": "# Why Bless Eisav and not Yackov\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why was it that Yizhak originally chose to bless Eisav and not Yackov? I would have thought he would bless both of his sons equally. Why did he choose to only give the blessing to one of them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yitzchak <strong>did have equal</strong> blessings for both of his sons.  He intended to bless Eisav with general wealth and prosperity.  As it says in Genesis 27:28-29, \"May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fat places of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine...\"  This is a blessing that Eisav should be well-off and successful in life.  However, there was also a second blessing that was specific to this family - the covenant that God made with Abraham, that his family should inherit that Land of Canaan and that his children will be like the stars in the sky (Genesis 15).  This was the blessing that Yitzchak intended to give to Yaakov - and he does give it to him, in Genesis 28:3-5.  \"And may God bless you and make you a mighty nation, and give you the <em>blessing of Abraham,</em> that you shall inherit the Land that God promised to Abraham.\"  [Translation is mine.]</p>\n\n<p>So you see that there are two blessings.  Eisav was supposed to get a general blessing of wealth and success, and Yaakov was supposed to get the specific Abraham's Family blessing.  However, Yaakov, at Rivka's insistence, jumped the gun, and took both blessings.  Perhaps if he hadn't done so, the verses which tell us that Eisav hated Yaakov would have instead told us that Yitzchak invited Yaakov over so that he could bless him as well.</p>\n\n<p>Don't just take my word for it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbi Menachem Leibtag deals with this issue at length.  You can view his shiur online at <a href=\"http://www.tanach.org/breishit/toldot/toldot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PARSHAT TOLDOT - ' the chosen son'</a></li>\n<li>Rabbi Yaakov Meidan proposes that Yitzchak intended to split the Abrahamic blessing between both his sons.  (He still fully intended to bless both of them.)  You can read his shiur here: <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/esavs-merit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esav's Merit</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Why did Rivka persuasade Yaakov to get both blessings?  One answer is the one quoted by @Rony above.  Or, perhaps Rivka simply misunderstood Yitzchak's intentions, and thought that he intended to give the Abraham-specific blessing to Eisav.  Rabbi Elchanan Samet deals with this question, and you can view his answers here: <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/moral-dimension-story-yitzchaks-blessings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Moral Dimension of the Story of Yitzchak's Blessings (Bereishit 26:34-28:9)</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is an opinion which I heard in a shiur given by Rabbi Baruch Rosenblum, that Yizhak knew that Am Yisrael will be Malechet Cohanim (a nation of Cohanim) totally invloved in Torah and avodat Hashem, but for that you need a Zebulun that will take care after all the material needs of the Cohanim. He thought that Eisav would be this Zebulun and that is why he wanted to give him the blessing that dealt with what is needed to achieve this. Rivka knew that this had no chance and so the story developed the way it did. Yizhak had in mind to bless Ya'akov with the spiritual blessing, which he eventually did.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11755/37\">here</a>, from R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi, also addresses this issue. In brief, Yitzchak planned to bless Eisav because he thought that this would be the right way to redeem the spiritual \"sparks\" that he possessed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can people effectively bless when blessing is God's domain?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How do people have the power to bless?  Yitzchak's blessings for his sons pretty much came true, and similarly later when Yaakov blesses his children and earlier (in the inverse) Noach curses Canaan.  How do mere humans, even if they are the patriarchs, have the ability to make these (correct) pronouncements about the futures of their children?  Only God has the power to determine such things.  Are the blessers acting on their own initiative or is God speaking through them and they're just the vehicle?</p>\n\n<p>One source for blessing being God's domain is in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8230/showrashi/true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Rashi on Gen 35:11</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am the Almighty God: Heb. שַׁדַּי. For I have the power (כְּדַי) to bless, because the blessings are Mine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not talking about blessings that are actually requests of God, like birkat kohanim.  Rather I am talking about the places where a person says \"such-and-such will happen to you\" and it does.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I think what you say is mostly true... until the avos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"וְאֶעֶשְׂךָ, לְגוֹי גָּדוֹל, וַאֲבָרֶכְךָ, וַאֲגַדְּלָה שְׁמֶךָ; וֶהְיֵה, בְּרָכָה.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>והיה ברכה - הברכות נתונות בידך, עד עכשיו היו בידי, ברכתי את אדם ואת נח\n  ואותך, ומעכשיו אתה תברך את אשר תחפוץ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Rashi, beginning of Lech L'cha)</p>\n\n<p>God specifically gives over the power of blessing to the Avos, which is why they and their descendants have that ability. Though it seems it existed in a more limited fashion before also, e.g. Noach did bless and curse his children. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is a difference between a blessing from God and a blessing from another person. Consider the blessing given by the <em>kohanim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֹּה תְבָרֲכוּ אֶת בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אָמוֹר לָהֶם. יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ.  יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וִיחֻנֶּךָּ. יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָׁלוֹם. וְשָׂמוּ אֶת שְׁמִי עַל בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וַאֲנִי אֲבָרֲכֵם</p>\n<p>This is how you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them: \"May the Lord bless you and watch over you. May the Lord cause His countenance to shine to you and favor you. May the Lord raise His countenance toward you and grant you peace.\" They shall bestow My Name upon the children of Israel, so that I will bless them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why are they blessing the people that God <em>should bless them</em>? Why don't the <em>kohanim</em> bless the people themselves?</p>\n<p>The answer is that they are. A blessing from God is His granting you with good things, His \"guarding you and favoring you\". A blessing from a Person A to Person B, on the other hand, is Person A's prayer to God that He should bless Person B. This is the case with the blessing of the <em>kohanim</em>, and it is the case with any human blessing another.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I once heard this as a natural outcome of some of the Midah K'neged Midah (A ways of saying that punishments fit the crime) systems that work in the world.\nWhen you speak Lashon Harah about another person, you bring upon judgement about your self.  When you judge people harshly, you yourself get judged harshly. When you bless people, you yourself get blessed. Part of the blessing you receive is that your words are trusted and become true.  Similarly, but slightly different, is the idea that \"A good name is more precious than jewels.\"  If someone curses you, it is a sign that you have some flaw that needs to be repaired, when someone blesses you, they see you as a person worthy of praise.  Again, this comes as a natural outcome to the concepts of 'having a good name' or the inverse problems with the evil eye.</p>\n\n<p>These systems, along with the ability to do Teshuva at any point in our lives are some of the greatest Gifts that Gd bestows upon people.</p>\n\n\n",

(This is contrary to Rabbanu Tam who says that an outright divorce with a promise to remarry was given).  </p>\n\n<p>Should we all be giving/receiving these retroactive divorces today given the terrorist threat and the unfortunate situation of terror making it possible that our loved one may not return home to us?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2\">Isaac</a>'s nailed it, in a comment on the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The average person's chances of chas veshalom getting killed in a terror attack today are, thank God, nowhere near the same league as those of someone who goes out to war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two more points to consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the decade 2000-2010, there were <em>b\"H</em> fewer than 1000 deaths by terrorism in Israel, a country with some 7 million people during that decade. That's fewer than 14 deaths per million per year. Of the more than 300 million people in the US, some 43000 die annually in traffic accidents. That's more than 140 deaths per million per year, ten times as many as by terror in Israel. By the logic in the question, everyone (except perhaps <em>kohanim</em>) should divorce his wife in the States, too, not just Israel. (That's not really an answer to the question, just a comment. I'm just sticking it in here since I'm answering already.)</li>\n<li>I think the process of writing and giving a divorce — not the simplest of matters — <em>every single day</em> (in case <em>chas v'shalom</em> the person doesn't return that day) is infeasible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The question has been raised in contemporary times vis-a-vis Israeli soldiers. (And if I recall correctly from a lecture by Rabbi J D Bleich, Jewish soldiers in the British Army during WWII as well.) As Rabbi Bleich pointed out, in today's information era there are exceedingly few cases of people who outright disappear at war. (To prove his point, he asked \"how many US Vietnam MIAs are there today?\") An additional wrinkle is that the Get would say \"if I don't return within time X\"; often with today's wars it's not uncommon for soldiers to return home every so often, not quite knowing when they'll be deployed; so a soldier would have to do a new retroactive Get each time he leaves.</p>\n\n<p>The retroactive divorce was also proposed as a solution to the <em>other</em> agunah problem (\"Type II Agunah\", as Rabbi Breitowitz puts it; or as Rabbi Rakeffet says, \"man-made agunah\"), that of the husband who is clearly alive and right here, but refuses to give a Get. Why not, the day after the wedding, have the husband hand his wife a paper that says \"you are hereby divorced from me right now if at any point we spend 2 years not living under the same roof.\"\nThe objection to this came in the early 1900s from (if I recall correctly) Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer, who raised the following possibility of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences\" rel=\"nofollow\">unintended consequence</a>:</p>\n\n<p>In our current system, there are plenty of guys out there who are going through rough times in their marriage, but will stick it out and try to improve things. (Or if G-d forbid things really are serious and irreparable, go through the right process to make clear it's over and how to settle it.) They know that leaving a woman an agunah is utterly reprehensible. \nBut if we have everyone giving their wives this conditional divorce now, \nwhat's to stop a husband from running off to who-knows-where and abandoning his wife? He knows that in 2 years no matter what, she'll be free to remarry!</p>\n\n\n",

If, for instance, a synagogue wanted to add one (or more?) aliyahs, a reasonably-knowledgable Torah-reader would look at the above rules and make an additional division as suits him.</p>\n<p>In some Torah portions the divisions are a bit more conspicuous; for instance, Vayeshev is a rather depressing portion: \"they hated Joseph, they wanted to kill him, they sold him down to Egypt, his father mourned, he got thrown in jail, the baker died, Joseph got left in jail.\" The divisions here try to find any nice-sounding verse, and end on that: \"his brothers hated him, but his father held on to the matter.\" [STOP! SOMETHING NICE-SOUNDING!] \"The other brothers wanted to kill him, but Reuben secretly wanted to rescue him.\" [STOP!] Or in the next portion, this mysterious and sadistic Egyptian viceroy is making the brothers completely miserable, but at one point he offers to make a deal, \"because I fear the Lord.\" [STOP! SOMETHING NICE!]</p>\n<p>The whole sordid affair with the Golden Calf is crammed in to two ginormous aliyot given to the Cohen and Levi; the five non-Levites after that get small slivers of the remaining portion. This is to avoid giving any of that sad issue to a non-Levite (whose ancestors likely participated in it).</p>\n\n\n",

That is why Yaakov needed to spend 14 years there before spending 14 years at the House of lavan.</p>\n\n<p>When Yaakov had his dream, he dreamt of the ladder which as the posuk says was rooted on earth and touched the heavens, i.e. it tied together both schools of thought.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Maharsh'a on megilla 17a says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוה יעקב מוטמן בבית עבר י\"ד שנים - ... דבית עבר נמי בבאר שבע ולא הלך כלל מבאר שבע לבית עבר אלא שהיה מוטמן בבאר שבע בבית עבר... ועוד נראה דאביו יצחק נמי היה לו בית המדרש כדאמרינן ביומא יצחק זקן ויושב בישיבה היה כו' וכל שלשה מדרשות של שם ושל עבר ושל יצחק בבאר שבע היו</p>\n<p>Ya'akov was hidden in Ever's house (Yeshiva) for 14 years... For Ever's house was also in Be'er Sheva (where Yitzchak and family were living at the time), and Ya'akov didn't leave Be'er Sheva for Ever's house, rather he was hiding in Be'er Sheva in Ever's house... And it also seems that his father, Yitzchak, also had a Beis Midrash, as it says in Yoma \"Yitzchak was a Zaken, and sat in Yeshiva\", and all three yeshivos, of Shem, of Ever, and of Yitzchak were in Be'er Sheva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see something very important in this maharash'a: Shem's and Ever's yeshivas were not the same yeshiva. (This is also seen in B'reishis Rabba 63:10). We also see that Yitzchak had his own yeshiva, also in Be'er Sheva.</p>\n<p>In the gemara mentioned by the maharash'a (Yoma 28b), it also mentions that Avraham and Ya'akov both had their own yeshivas. It also says there that while in mitzraim and while in the desert, B'nei Yisrael had yeshivos.</p>\n<p>So it seems likely that what happened to \"Yeshivas Shem V'Ever\" is that it changed Rosh Yeshiva. Although the times overlap, it seems clear that Ever followed in Shem's footsteps and taught Torah, Avraham followed suit, as did Yitzchak and Ya'akov. (Note that Yitzchak was \"only\" 80 by the time Shem, Ever and Avraham had all died, and his was the only Yeshiva still in operation).</p>\n<p>The same gemara in Yoma says that Avraham kept the entire Torah, including Torah sh'Ba'al Peh, so seemingly that's what they learned in Yeshiva. We also see in Avoda Zara (36b) that Shem and his beis din (maybe Ever and Avraham?) Paskened that it's assur for a woman to commit z'nus with a Goy (I'm not sure how exactly they'd define a Goy, seeing as there were no Jews. Maybe any non-Semite?)</p>\n<p>I haven't see any sources for what happened to the students, but possibly the same as what happened to Avraham's Geirim. (which is itself not exactly clear, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11296/what-happened-to-avrahams-students\">What happened to Avraham's students?</a>). It's also possible that there weren't many students, as the midrash states¹ that Avraham was the first person to 'call HaShem's name in the world', implying that others that came before him weren't as successful in their outreach.</p>\n<p>In short, the Yeshiva moved to wherever the current Gadol Dor was, all the way to the Midbar (where Moshe took over). They seemingly learned the entire Torah, including the oral Torah, and the students (besides for B'nei Yisrael) possibly went the same way as Avraham's Geirim.</p>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>Though I couldn't find the source, I'm relatively certain that this is said about Avraham</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Others say it goes from the date of the burial (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47632&st=&pgnum=383\">Pnei Baruch 34:9</a>).  The amount of time a soul should have the kadish is the 12 months of geihinom.  The minhag is to retract this to 11 months so that it doesn't appear as if the son is assuming his parent needed geihinom (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=378\">Rema YD 276:4</a>).  I have heard allowances for non-children to go for 12 months, and even for children to try to daven for the amud (not as a chiyuv), but saying only the kadish delegated to the shatz.</p>\n\n<p>Ihe 12 month time frame is based on the date of death, it would end the date prior to the date of death (the next year), that would be the last day of Adar with kadish ending the last day of Shevat.  A leap year would not change things- it still goes by 11 months.  The last day, the yom hafsaka, allows the avel priority over other 11 month mourners. If you go by the date of burial, it would be one day later.</p>\n\n<p>Actual mourning starts after the burial, so the 12 months of mourning would end the day prior to the kvurah date (the next year), in this case, the first of Nissan.  This also goes by months, so 12 months in a leap year would be the first of adar 2.  It is a custom to mourn on the 1st yahrtzeit as well.</p>\n\n\n",

Since Shem was greater, she went only to him. </p></li>\n<li><p>See the <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=HYLi3l9ylWwC&lpg=PA35&vq=ever&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=true\">Toras Menachem in the Gutnik Chumash</a>, where the Lubavitcher Rebbe points out that Rashi previously wrote that Shem was MalkiTzedek, high priest of G-d (Bereshit 14:18). Where did Rivka go to when \"<em>she went to inquire of the Lord.</em>\"? She went to Shem, not in his capacity as a teacher, but in his capacity as the high priest of G-d. Therefore Ever was excluded.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14385&st=&pgnum=150\">midrash</a> that I assume Rashi is quoting actually does say that she went to \"מדרשו של שם ועבר\". However, lower on that same page, it does identify Shem as the one who is the official navi (though not clear if it's talking about Rivka or Hagar). Interestingly, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=295\">Abarbanel</a> quotes the midrash as saying that she went to the <em>beis midrash</em> of Shem and Eiver, but it was Shem who told her the <em>nevua</em>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34563&st=&pgnum=120\">Radak</a>, however, writes that it could just as easily have been Avraham that Rivka went to. (See also the Abarbanel linked above, who writes that it is \"more correct\" to say that it was Avraham.)</p>\n\n<p>As to why not Yitzchak, I would venture to say that we have no evidence that Yitzchak was capable of <em>nevua</em> at this point in his life (he lived one third of his life by this point). And even if he was, I'm not really surprised that she didn't go to him first. We don't find that Yitzchak and Rivka were the greatest of communicators. It seems evident that Rivka never told Yitchak what the navi told her about Eisav and Yaakov. Yitzchak and Rivka remained, according to the Torah, on completely separate wavelengths when it came to Yaakov and Eisav. But that is another question entirely.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Shapira explained this as part of a broader approach to the difference between the philosophy of Avraham and that of Shem.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, Shem was an ascetic, and believed in spirituality divorced from physicality.  His Torah was the Torah of pure spirituality which does not involve the physicality.  He is, therefore, the authority on the disconnect between spiritual heights and physical depravity. Therefore, Yaakov visited the Yeshiva of Shem and Ever on his way to Lavan (Rashi to Bereishis 28:11) - a Yeshiva in which one does not sleep (neglect of the body)  - in order to understand the Torah of disconnected spirituality, as Lavan had a lofty neshama and was a miserable wretch.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham, on the other hand, believed in spirituality which manifests itself in your every day life.  His name was 248 in gematria corresponding to the 248 limbs which are involved in serving Hashem.  Nimrod had Avraham thrown into a furnace but left Shem alone because Avraham's was a threatening philosophy but Shem's spirituality did not infringe on how they wanted to live their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Rivka had a pregnancy which she believed to be one individual with very polar opposite pulls.  When she walked by a Beis Medrash, Yaakov would start squirming to come out, and when she passed by a house of idolatry, Eisav would squirm to come out (Rashi to Bereishis 25:22).  But she did not know that this was two diametrically opposite babies inside her until after she was given that answer - she thought it was one child with an extreme disconnect between his spirituality and the impact it would have on how he lived his life.  Therefore, Shem was the Navi to consult.</p>\n\n\n",

How is this possible if 'nothing is new'?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The key phrase there in Koheles is \"under the sun.\" The Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=30b&format=pdf\">Shabbos 30b</a>) explains that this means the natural world, as opposed to Torah which was created \"before the sun.\" (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%A7%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%92\">Rashi to Eccles. 1:3</a> explains a little differently: תחת can also mean \"instead,\" and \"sun\" symbolizes the light of Torah, so תחת השמש means \"things done instead of Torah study.\")</p>\n\n<p>The era of Moshiach, then, doesn't have to be subject to the same constraints of \"nothing new.\" If, as the Midrash (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14385&pgnum=418\">Vayikra Rabbah 13:3</a>, paraphrasing <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95_%D7%A0%D7%90_%D7%93\">Is. 51:4</a>) states, at that time there will be \"a new Torah\" (i.e., new dimensions of Torah that were never revealed before), then by the same token there can be novelties in the natural order.

According to most commentators, they are: Babylonia, Persia/Media, Greece (Alexander the Great and his Hellenistic successors), and Rome and her cultural inheritors. Each of these indeed ruled over the majority of the world's Jews in its time. (Note that for nearly half of the Second Temple era - 206 years, according to Avodah Zarah 8b-9a - the Romans exercised greater or lesser direct influence over the Land of Israel, even though for part of that time it had Jewish rulers, first the Hasmoneans and then the Herodians.)</p>\n\n<p>Another view (R.

Yonah concluded that their repentance must be relevant to Israel in some way, particularly to exile them from their land. (Yonah knew that the Jews weren't on the highest spiritual level at that point.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Yonah refused to go, not wanting to play any part in Israel's destruction. He hoped that God would choose another navi in his place, as clearly, if God wanted this done, it must be necessary. But not him. To try and ensure this, Yonah tried to flee to outside of Eretz Yisrael, as he believed that nevua does not exist outside of the land (which is true, with few exceptions).

Yonah doesn't run away to get to a different place; Yonah sets sail in order to be at sea, and there is no prophecy at sea.  </p>\n\n<p>This is related to the idea that the sea is too different from the earth to be involved in earth-based things (e.g. fish are created from the water, but animals from the earth; fish were not punished during the flood; fish are never brought as sacrifices).</p>\n\n<p>Specifically regarding Yonah, this issue is explained by <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90_%D7%92\">the Malbim</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכן עלה אל האניה, שחשב שבעת יהיה באניה לא תחול עליו רוח ה', אם מפני שיורדי הים דעתם בלתי מתישבת מצער הים עד בואם ליבשה כמ\"ש חז\"ל, אם מפני שאז לא יתבודד באשר היו על האניה עובדי אלילים שכ\"ז תעכב בל תשרה השכינה עליו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Therefore he went to the ship, since he thought that when he would be in the ship the Divine Presence would not rest on him, either because those who set sail have unfocused thoughts from the difficulty of the sea until they come to dry land, as our sages have said, or because then he could not be alone, as there were idol worshipers on the ship; that all this would prevent the Divine presence from resting on him.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The answer that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18902/603\">Menachem gave</a> is brought up by Rashi on the pasuk. The question still remains, what did he thought he would achieve by running away? This reminds me of the situation in which Moshe Rabenu told Hashem, Shemot 32:32, that if you don't pardon Am Yisrael \"omit me\" from your book. Out of love to Am Yisrael he didn't want to be part of the punishment. Same here: Yonah, out of love to Am Yisrael, doesn't want to be part of disgracing Am Yisrael, so he uses his Bechira chofshit (free will?) and prefers to die and not be part of the plot. </p>\n\n\n",

For two reasons, however, Esau did not follow Jacob to Padan Aram to marry one of his cousins from the royal line of Shem: (1)(2) Firstly, he understood that Jacob had gone there in order to fulfill Isaac's blessings, and he knew very well that he was no longer party to these blessings. (3) And secondly, he sought to outdo Jacob—who went to marry a girl who was merely a member of Abraham's extended family—by marrying a girl who was Abraham's direct descendant. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So to sum it up, Eisav saw that Yitzchok blessed Yaakov and sent him to Padan Aram to marry and fulfill those blessings, and Yaakov listened right away. He decided to show Yitzchok that he could do better than Yaakov, so, without even being asked, he right away married Machlat, Avraham's granddaughter, as opposed to someone who was only a descendant of Avraham's brother. He didn't leave Canaan to find a wife, since Yaakov went to fulfill the brachot Yitzchok gave him (I believe this refers to the blessing directly connected to going to Padan Aram (Bereshit 23:1-4), not the blessings that Yaakov took from Eisav), which Eisav did not receive.</p>\n\n<p>I think this addresses everything Eisav saw.</p>\n\n\n",

So they instituted to say these pesukim which correspond to the 18 mentions of HaShem’s name in the maariv Amidah  (and they omitted the maariv Amidah) and they finished and left after they had said kaddish. </p>\n\n<p>And now that that we have reinstituted to daven (the Amidah of) maariv in our shuls, we did not remove the original minhag. Nevertheless one must not interrupt with anything else. And there were some Gedolim who had the minhag not to say these pesukim. </p>\n\n<p>IMHO, we see from the MB that the kaddish is part of the original minhag and was said after “Boruch HaShem leolom omain veomain” which was the substitute for the maariv Amidah. There would have been no problem in responding “brich hu” to this kaddish and this is part of the minhag that has not been removed.  I think this is what the MB means by “Nevertheless one must not interrupt with <strong>anything else</strong>.” He implies that this is in a sense an interruption but permitted because of the original minhag. </p>\n\n\n",

The reason for this is that the Midrashim creates many stories with conflicting information as to what we should expect to look for. For example, are we looking for 12 paths, that return back to the same shore, or 1 path that leads to the other side of the yam? Are we looking for evidence of plants and bread being grown into the ocean walls?  Are we looking for Egyptian armor and tools, or did those wash ashore to the Israelites for them to use in the war with Amalek later on?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, there is a person who has created a video which you can find online, which claims to have found wheels and axles of Egyptian chariots in a body of water near egypt and some high cliffs.

Was it immediate, or could there have been some period during which the prophet wasn't yet sure what was happening to him?</p>\n\n<p>(This question arose out of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/11510/472\">why did Yonah run away?</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>In general, it seems the prophet would fall into a prophetic state, so it would be clear that it wasn't just a random voice speaking to him. See, for example, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm\">Berishis 15</a> where God appears to Avraham first in \"a vision\", and then in \"a deep sleep... a dread, a great darkness\". </p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that sometimes Nevuah sounded just like a person's voice, and the prophet could have initially confused it for a person speaking. See <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a03.htm\">Shemuel 3</a> where Shemuel repeatedly mistakes the voice of God for Eli's. The passuk explains why this could happen: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD\n  yet revealed unto him</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems in certain cases there \"could have been some period during which the prophet wasn't yet sure what was happening to him\". </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rambam Hilchos Yesodei Hatorah chapter 7:1, 3 indicates that the person receiving the prophecy is a clear thinker whose mind is connected with God constantly.

This sign could take the form of a pillar of fire or a pillar of cloud or a light that did not emanate from the ordinary luminaries.

How, though, does it work for other types of transactions - whether secured loans such as home mortgages or car loans, or unsecured ones such as credit cards? There too, the lender wants some return on his investment. (Or maybe indeed it can't be made to work in a halachically acceptable manner, and then indeed a Jew would be forbidden to take out one of these kinds of loans from a Jewish-owned bank.)</p>\n\n<p>(The question is really more about how things are done in Israel.

The reason is that the borrower has other assets, which he has decided not to sell off in order to fund whatever he is using this money for.  As such, the retained assets are the investment that is a joint venture, and it can be on that investment that the iska applies.  </p>\n\n<p>I'd point out that in the case of a mortgage, while most don't see it as a business venture, there is a reasonable possibility that the asset will increase in value, and as such it is itself an investment.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In some versions of the heter iska contracts, [specifically in the \"Heter Iska Bris Pinchas\" - see link below]  there is a stipulation which states that if the monies received were not directly invested in potentially profit-making venue, the \"giver\" (the person who gives the money) will receive a share in any potentially profit-making assets which are owned by the receiver of the money.\nThus as long as the party receiving the money owns any type of potentially profit-making assets, the heter iska would still be valid even if the funds were not used for a business investment.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s502/res/a82e6223-40c4-4438-b11b-e15c5a8af9c9/%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%A8%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%A8%20%D7%A2%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%90%20%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA%20%282%29%20%281%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the HETER ISKA BRIS PINCHAS</p>\n\n\n",

They recite <strong>Tikkun Chatzos</strong> and other special prayers, and\n  certain chapters of <strong>Tehillim</strong> each day. They regularly immerse\n  themselves in the <strong>mikveh</strong>, and are careful not to speak of any subject\n  that is not holy, even in Hebrew. After the Maariv prayer at the\n  conclusion of the fortieth day of the fast — while they are still fasting\n  — they spend the whole night <strong>studying Torah</strong>.  </p>\n  \n  <p>While it is still night,\n  about two hours before dawn, the <strong>Holy Ark is opened</strong>, and the chief\n  of the court reads the text of the cheirem three times. They then sound\n  the <strong>shofar</strong>: tekiah shevarim teruah tekiah. They remove their shoes and sit\n  upon the ground like mourners. Afterwards, they immerse\n  themselves and daven with great devotion. They daven Minchah early,\n  and only then do they eat their meal: bread dipped in salt, and water.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When this occurs, the person's soul is, (may G-d preserve us):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>\"cut off from the source of his soul as it once\n  existed on High.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been done apparently only three times in history. To Yeravam ben Nevat, Elisha ben Avuyah (or \"Acher\"), and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/6326/883\">יש\"ו</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The person to whom this is done, now having been cut off from \"on High\", inevitably converts to another religion, (or athiesm, possibly).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What's the source for this?  </li>\n<li>Are there sifrei kabbalah that describe this?  </li>\n<li>What about the three people to whom this was done? Are they mentioned regarding this?  </li>\n<li>Kabbalistically, what does it mean that their soul is \"cut off from the source\"?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The idea of being \"cut off from its source\" I believe is also related in  Mesechet Chagiga (I think around 14a or so). When Rabbi Meir asked Acher to do teshuva, Acher related he was riding on a horse on Yom Kippur past a shul, where a voice emenated \"All you come back to me, all except Acher\", to which he took it to mean that he could never repent. According to commentaries there, the real meaning behind this is that G-d is always available to offer 'help', as it were, to those who want to repent. In Acher's case, no such help was available to him. However, if he himself repented, his repentance would be accepted. This is found in Acher's case in a couple of ways: 1) Acher's daughter came begging for alms once to a Rabbi. The Rabbi was astonished that there should be descendants of Acher, after which a heavenly fire burned him. If Acher truly was unable to repent, he would not have descendants. 2) In the 10th chapter of Sanhedrin, the Mishna relates a series of people who will not be resurrected at the end of days because of their sins. Acher's name is not mentioned in this list. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think you are referring to this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsa_diNura\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pulsa Denurah</a></p>\n\n<p>The source and the sifrei kabbalah that describe it are the Seforim  Sefer ha-Razim and Harba de-Moshe .

Keeping wool and linen separate in garments reminds us of this Biblical episode and its lessons.</p>\n<p>Some see Shaatnez as having its origins in pagan cults of old, thus being one of many mitzvot geared towards keeping us far away from idolatry.</p>\n<p>Others point out that some of the garments of the Kohen Gadol (and possibly the belt of every kohen) were Shaatnez. Perhaps this particular combination of wool and linen is off-limits for us in our everyday lives to highlight a  special place the combination has in the holy service of G-d.</p>\n<p>Others point out that Shaatnez completes the set of forbidden combinations - there are plant-plant prohibitions, animal-animal prohibitions, and Shaatnez represents the forbidden blending of plant and animal. (Important: only the  combinations that G-d forbid us to have are considered sinful. We do not extend this idea to the many permitted mixtures of our experience.)</p>\n<p>And some commentaries include Shaatnez in the group of mitzvot that are meant to sensitize us towards treating the animals kindly. Fiber is fiber, and as humans, we can take fibers for fabric and clothing from any source we so  choose, in any way we want. WRONG. Perhaps the mitzva of Shaatnez is to remind us that the flax plant and the sheep are not the same. When we shear sheep for wool, our main goal should not be economics. How to do it fastest, most cost-efficient. We must take the sheep's well-being into account.</p>\n<p>Shaatnez is A CHOK; we do not really know why the rules are as they are.

In chapter XLIX, he says that \"most of the chukim, the reason of which is unknown to us, serve as a fence against idolatry.\" </p>\n\n<p>He proves this using The Nabatean Agriculture, an ancient book from the idolatrous Sabean civilization that Avraham was raised in. He also differentiates between the general and specifics of commandments and shows that many of the seemingly arbitrary specifics of mitzvas are actually rooted in Nabatean idolatrous practices (which were agriculturally driven). For instance, a general mitzvah is to bring sacrifices, but why specifically oxen, sheep and goats? Because the Nabateans worshiped oxen as gods and goats as daemons, and prohibited slaying them. Likewise, the Egyptians worshiped Aries and prohibited killing sheep.</p>\n\n<p>In chapter XXXV he includes wool and linen in <em>the second class</em>, that \"comprises the precepts which are connected with the prohibition of idolatry\".  The reason he gives for these prohibitions \"is to establish certain true principles\" (that the scripture demands) \"and to perpetuate them among the people\". </p>\n\n<p>To prove this, in chapter XXXVII, he says it's written in their books that the Nabatean priests wore garments made of plant and animal while holding a seal of mineral (some sort of idolatry while wearing wool and linen), and since we reject all idolatrous practices, it's prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I read a very nice answer to this question today in the <a href=\"http://ttidbits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OU Israel Torah Tidbits (1172 p. 9)</a> from Phil Chernofsky</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wool is the chief fiber from the animal kingdom.

We know about the curiously ordered contents of <em>Parashat Nasso</em> (Bamidbar 5 & 6), i.e. <em>Sotah</em>, <em>Nazir</em>, and <em>Birkat Cohanim</em> (the priestly blessing).  Even though Hannah's son, Shmuel, was designated as a <em>Nazir</em>, Rabbi El'azar did not take that into account.

Perhaps Rabbi El'azar learns that a false accusation not only obligates the accused to defend his/herself, but also requires the accuser to release the accused with a blessing ... because Eli <em>Kohen Gadol</em> replays the Torah's original scenario in the same way a <em>Sotah</em> is vindicated and <em>Nazir</em> status is closed with <em>Birkat Cohanim</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

The only reason that those who subscribed earlier are protected from the increase is because they advanced funds at an earlier time. This benefit is prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The practical solution given there is that the publisher should offer the subscriber the option of paying the publisher itself or to place the money in escrow to be withdrawn by the publisher at the appropriate time. This eliminates the possibility that the discount is motivated by the advance payment. [It is also recommended that a <em>heter iska klali</em> be used.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# At what age should we start teaching the distinction between Midrash and Text?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At a very early age children learn the history of the world and the Jews through the enthralling stories found in many varied sources.  </p>\n\n<p>They learn that the world was created in six days; that Avraham knocked down the idols in his father's store; that Hashem told Avraham Lech Lecha and Avraham and Sarah traveled away from their homeland; that Issac married Rivka at the age of three; etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with teaching in this way is, in my view, children don't differentiate text based stories and Midrashim.  This may no seem to be a problem on the surface, however just from the list above we have a two-fold problem.  </p>\n\n<p>First, when the student begins to be able to read the chumash on their own some famed and loved stories do not appear even as the student spends hours searching and becoming discouraged at the text and his/her teachers. I have adult friends who still remember being very confused that Avraham's father's idol shop appears nowhere in the text.</p>\n\n<p>Second, several Midrashim can be found on certain issues, including that of how old Rivka was when she got married, so once the student can reconcile him/herself to the fact that his/her teacher has some how mixed everything up in his/her head (if they can reconcile themselves) the student now has to deal with the fact that he/she was taught only one of many possible stories and therefore needs to explore why the teacher chose that one to teach and how will he/she now be able to reconcile all the differences of the rabbis with the over riding bias that the teacher gave him or her at such an early age.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when should we be teaching the differences between Midrash and Text and what can be found in each? How do we help both students and teachers with how to incorporate both into teaching without causing students undo difficulty while still receiving a complete Jewish education. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Teach the difference from the very beginning. </p>\n\n<p>Even if they don't really understand the difference between saying that a story is written in the Torah, or is from a Midrash/Gemara/Rashi but doesn't appear in the Torah, you wont damage them by inserting a little comment right before/after a story giving its source. Kids are smart - they will hear what you say and store it for later. And when they get older and start to read, then you can show them more about the sources for different stories, explain the difference between the Written Torah and Oral Torah, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>After trying out a few different approaches with my own children (12 of them, boys and girls) it seems pretty clear to me that children should be taught the midrashim right away because they will be picking them up anyways in school and in their own reading and learning. However, they should be taught immediately and repetitively about the concept that these teachings are midrashim that are not always to be understood literally and there many opinions that contradict these teachings. However, one should be very careful to not degrade in the child's eyes the concept of the Torah she'bal peh as that itself can be as dangerous as believing that every Midrash is part of the peshuto shel mikrah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_Schachter\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.

Afterwards they should be taught Midrash. He explained that Midrash is <em>Torah Sheb'al Peh</em>, and distinct from <em>mikra</em> which is supposed to be taught first.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably he had in mind Avot (5:21) which states that five years of age is the time of learning <em>mikra</em>, and ten years of age is the time of learning Mishnah (a term often taken to mean to <em>Torah Sheb'al Peh</em> as a whole, see e.g Hilkhot Talmud Torah 1:12).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the age to first teach Midrash at all, would be ten.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>An interview with R.

You can view it here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_English_Bible_translations\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_English_Bible_translations</a>\nThis website also compares several different translations: <a href=\"http://www.bluethread.com/reviews/chumashim/index.html#Translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bluethread.com/reviews/chumashim/index.html#Translation</a></p>\n\n<p>Here's my personal opinion of the different translations, based on an somewhat-extensive unscientific survey:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Old JPS is based primarily on the KJV, but with major changes. It's\n  pretty literal, accurate, and highly regarded. The main problems are\n  1. It's based on the KJV, and inherits a few of the KJV's problems; 2. Uses outdated English; 3. Doesn't have any translations based on\n  linguistic research done since 1917. New JPS vs Artscroll: Both strike\n  a middle-ground between strict literal and paraphrase, but Artscroll\n  is more literal than JPS, and the JPS takes some (unjustifiable)\n  liberties. For example, JPS will re-order the position of entire\n  phrases (and rarely, verses) to make the English flow better.\n  Artscroll will re-order words, but never whole verses. JPS breaks up\n  the English paragraphs according to what they thought made sense,\n  whereas Artscroll follows the Hebrew paragraph breaks (usually). JPS\n  breaks up poetry into stanzas, which Artscroll does not do. In\n  addition, Artscroll is unabashedly Orthodox, whereas JPS is\n  non-denominational. This has the following implications: 1. The\n  Introductions to the translations could not possible be more\n  different. Artscroll has a ultra-Orthodox, \"the Bible was never\n  changed\" approach (which is blatantly false, and has been acknowledged\n  as such by traditional sources), whereas the JPS has a more academic\n  approach. 2. The JPS has footnotes which frequently acknowledge when\n  they're not sure of the translation of a certain word of phrase.\n  Artscroll, following their ideology, almost never admits they don't\n  know what a word means, and will give the \"traditional\" interpretation\n  of that word without indicating such. They also (rarely) bend the text\n  to match Halakha (Jewish Law) instead of the exact translation.\n  Finally, Artscroll (depending on the version you buy) includes an\n  Orthodox\\Traditional commentary, which provide \"Midrashim\" and the\n  interpretations of Rabbis and the Halakha (Jewish Law) on certain\n  verses. JPS's commentary (again, depending on version) are more\n  concerned with the text itself - for example, it'll say when a similar\n  phrase is found elsewhere.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are other translations, as well. For example, Artscroll provides\n  additional versions that are based on a particular Rabbi's commentary.\n  In addition, Robert Alter has a very good translation of the\n  Pentateuch and Psalms). Everret Fox also produced a very unique\n  translation of the Pentateuch, which attempts to keep the Hebrew\n  syntax. Finally, you should avoid The Living Torah translation, and\n  any translation by Aryeh Kaplan. Great man, but the translation is\n  more commentary than text.</p>\n  \n  <p>A good traditional general-purpose commentary that explains all the\n  verses and provides short summaries and background information, then I\n  highly recommend the Hertz Chumash, written by one of the former Chief\n  Rabbis of England. It's older, and can sound some-what outdated, but\n  it's still the best general-purpose Chumash around. If you're looking\n  for a narrower commentary, keep reading. If you're looking for a\n  strictly traditional (ultraOrthodox) approach, then Artscroll (Stone\n  Chumash) is the way to go. If you're looking for a more academic\n  approach, then Robert Alter's translation and commentary is\n  recommended. If you're looking for a mix of tradition and academic,\n  then I highly recommed the Da'at Mikra series (Hebrew only). If you're\n  looking for a more progressive commentary, that's still somewhat\n  traditional, then I recommend the JPS Study Bible. If you're looking\n  for a traditional commentary that attempts to connect the verses to\n  modern life, then R' Samson Rafael Hirsch's commentary is the one.\n  There are commentaries to fill all niches.</p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, there are also the Traditional commentaries written by the\n  Medieval Rabbis, such as Rashi, Ramban (Nachmanides), Ibn Ezra and\n  Abarbanel, to name a few. Artscroll has published English translations\n  of Rashi and Ramban, and I believe translations exist for other\n  commentators as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah is one of the best translation's of the Torah I've seen. His translation of the written Torah is informed by the Oral Torah - thus making it truly an example of the Jewish Heritage. For example see his discussion in the intro about how he treats idioms in the text. Any translation that does not take the Oral Torah (Talmud & Midrash) into account is no longer worthy to be called a Torah translation - rather an Old Testament translation and estranged from Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Another one to see is the Koren - though I don't know it that well yet to comment</p>\n\n\n",

Since a month has to have an integral number of days, the months (usually) alternate between 30 and 29. The 30th day, then, is always going to have to be Rosh Chodesh:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the month was 29 days, then the 30th day is the first day of the next month, and is Rosh Chodesh by definition.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the month is 30 days, then part of the 30th day really already belongs to the next month (because, as above, the month should really have ended midway through that day), and therefore that day is celebrated as Rosh Chodesh.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the latter case, then, you're going to have two days of Rosh Chodesh, since after all the 30th day belongs to the previous month, and so the first day of the next month is again Rosh Chodesh by definition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I disagree with the answer above.  The month is not decided by the moon cycles, but by Witness testimony, so any astro science becomes somewhat irrelevant. For example if there are witnesses accepted when the moon is not new yet, we go after the Witnesses, not the actual placement of the moon.  So I thinks its wrong to say: then part of the 30th day really already belongs to the next month</p>\n\n<p>2 days comes from the same problem that creates 2 days Rosh HaShanna in Israel (although RH in Israel is fundamentally different as the 2nd day of the month is celebrated as a festival, which could never happen.)  You will see that 2 days Rosh Codesh is only when the previous month is 30 days.  If it is 29 days, the rosh chodesh is only 1 day.</p>\n\n<p>Since a month has to be 29 or 30 - As explained in the previous answer the 30th day is either the 30th day of month A, or day 1 of month B.  Day 30 is the only unknown in all this.  Witnesses will either come on the 30th and turn it into the 1st, or they wont come, and the 31st will have to become 1st of month B.</p>\n\n<p>Witnesses have to come in the daytime, so even if they come at the earliest time possible, the 30th has already had 12 hours before it turns into the 1st.</p>\n\n<p>So we keep every 30th as a Rosh Chodesh in case the Witnesses come.</p>\n\n<p>According to what I am saying, if the Mashicah comes on the 30th of the month, and the court is established in time, and witnesses come, they can technically turn that day into the 1st.  So we have to keep it just in case.</p>\n\n<p>(Similarly by Rosh hashanna - its not a delay in witnesses but a fundamental problem that what day it is today will not be know till some point in the future that creates the 2 days in Israel.  And we now keep the 2nd day on day 2(not 30 & 1) as a remembrance of this)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I wondered about this for many years, until I finally found that the (13th century Italian) Shiboley HaLeket discusses the question explicitly. <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8919&st=&pgnum=177\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See the Shiboley HaLeket in Siman 168</a>, who in turn quotes the (fellow 13th century Italian rabbi) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabeinu Yeshaya</a> which can be found in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21414&st=&pgnum=150\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabeinu Yeshaya's Teshuvos, number 32.</a></p>\n<p>Loosely translated and highly paraphrased, what Rabeinu Yeshaya says is that the reason Rosh Chodesh is two days only in cases of 29 day months is because there are two days that each have aspects of being Rosh Chodesh. Day \"30\" becomes day 1 of the incoming month, and hence is the day of actual kidush hachodesh. Day \"31\" which is now officially day 2 of the incoming month, is considered Day 1 for matters of counting the month and for legal documentation(שטרות). Since both days have aspects of being the first of the month in that situation, we observe two days.</p>\n\n\n",

The opening Mishna in Yevamot construes a case whereby the House of Shammai says this woman is obligated to either marry this man or perform a <em>chalitza</em> ceremony, with marriage being the Biblically-preferred choice.

    "content": "# Rabbinic Responses to Landline Telephones\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently the use of cellphones and smartphones has met with a lot of criticism in some communities. I'd be interested to see if landline telephones encountered any similar opposition when they were first introduced. Can anyone point me to rabbinic responses to landlines?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To my knowledge there was no opposition to utilizing telephones when they were initially introduced, the difficulty is that this in itself does not mean that there was no opposition. Furthermore, if there was no opposition, it could be difficult to demonstrate this fact since it is unlikely anyone would write teshuvos on why they do not object to an item that no one considered objectionable. Nevertheless, it seems that most of the discussion about [land-line] telephones seem to focus on their status on Shabbos/Yom Tov or their the propriety of using them to fulfill halachic obligations regarding hearing or speaking, which may support the notion that <i>their use</i> wasn't considered problematic in itself. This is also further supported by the fact the functions preserved by the \"Kosher\" cell phones you mention are those of the land line. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Israel you can own a <em>kosher</em> cell phone. This means that you have a constant monthly payment with a bank of minutes you can use to call other kosher phones <strong>and</strong> landline phones. Taking pictures, surfing, sending SMSs and so on are disabled on the phone. The calls to non-kosher cellphones are much more costly. Kosher cell phones are backed by Rabinical authorities.</p>\n\n<p>(There are some more details about this (that could be found <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>); I'm just presenting the main idea.)</p>\n\n<p>From the above I conclude that common practice in Israel is that any landline phone is equivalent to a kosher cellular phone. From this I cannot derive what happened when landlines were first introduced, but anyway I suppose they were not criticized.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is this not a valid way of evading the prohibition of ribbis?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 292:7 states the following halachah (from Bava Metzia 43a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If Reuven deposits money with Shimon (a moneychanger or storekeeper) for safekeeping, Shimon is entitled to use the money for his business and replace it with other funds. (This is different than other kinds of deposits, where he is expected to return the same item as was deposited with him.) Once he actually uses the money, he is fully responsible for anything that happens - even if it was lost in an unavoidable accident - and will have to repay Reuven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, presumably, anytime Reuven deposits something with Shimon, he can stipulate that Shimon should rent the thing out and they'll split the profits.</p>\n\n<p>So now, take the case of an <em>iska</em> (a partnership where one person puts up the capital for a business, the other one will manage it, and they'll split the profits). The Gemara (Bava Metzia 104b) characterizes such an arrangement as \"half loan and half deposit,\" and therefore this creates a problem of <em>ribbis</em>, because the managing partner is effectively doing the financier a favor in accepting and managing the deposit in return for having received the loan. In turn, this necessitates a <em>heter iska</em> to make the transaction permissible (by stipulating that the managing partner will receive a wage for his labor, plus other details intended to reduce the financier's exposure to risk as much as possible within the parameters of the laws of ribbis).</p>\n\n<p>Why, though, can't we just do it more simply? Why doesn't halachah just declare all of the capital a deposit rather than a loan, and then there is no problem: the managing partner is fully responsible (or, for that matter, he and the financier can arrange other terms, such as that he's responsible for only half of the money), and they can split the profits freely without any ribbis problems, because there's no loan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Shach there quotes Rif, who says that once the money is spent, the deposit converts to a loan, and that is why \"Shimon\" is responsible for all losses. This is only logical: The difference between a deposit (<em>pikadon</em>) and a loan (<em>halva'ah</em>) is that with the former, one returns the item itself, whereas with the latter, one is responsible to repay the <em>value</em> of the item. So in your case, it doesn't end up being a deposit at all, but rather a loan, so all the usual <em>ribbis</em> restrictions would apply.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>Ribbis</em> involves paying the lender money above and beyond the principal. In the case of a deposit, there would be no circumstance in which the guardian would be obligated to pay back more than the amount of money that was placed in his safekeeping and the issue of <em>ribbis</em> simply would not arise.</p>\n\n<p>The guardian's greater degree of obligation after using the money is because by using the money he changes himself from a <em>shomer</em> (guardian) (where the obligation is to protect the physical <em>pikadon</em>, in this case, cash) into a <em>loveh</em> (not a <em>sho'el</em>), who is obligated to pay back a specific sum of money but has no obligation with regard to the physical object placed under his supervision. As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16202/1216\">Dave</a> pointed out, once he is a <em>loveh</em>, all the conventional rules of <em>ribbis</em> would apply.</p>\n\n\n",

Basically, he says that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Aaron_Wertheimer\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Wertheimer</a>, who documented numerous manuscript specimens in the Cairo geniza and in other genizos in Yerushalayim, found that all old versions of this zemer had only six stanzas -- i.e., the ones spelling יצחק לח. The \"expanded\" version, with the acrostic יצחק לוריא חזק, was seemingly an invention of Shabsai Tzvi adherents. (I'm not sure whether Wertheimer was the one who first brought this version to light.) Reb Uri notes that in the original stanzas, the recurring words שבת מנוחה refer to Shabbos (as they are supposed to), while in the added stanzas, these words refer to Moshiach.

So he did in fact use it for something, even if not the purpose originally intended.</p>\n\n<p>Does this fall in the category of bal tashchis?\nWhat about the other things they do in filmmaking? Blowing things up (which is not always special effects), smashing things, breaking things...  </p>\n\n<p>Is it considered bal tashchis to use things for a purpose other than the one they were made for?<br>\nWhat if that purpose is for entertainment only?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although I am not at all familiar with the video or the controversy,I would suspect that many, or most, people were not upset because it constituted a <i>technical</i> violation of bal tashchis but because they felt it violated the principle of the matter.</p>\n\n<p>According to my understanding pretty much any <i>reason</i> to destroy something will override the prohibition of bal tashchis, only purposeless destruction is forbidden. But while the needs of the video as imagined probably constitute a reason to permit doing so, we must ask whether there was ultimately a need for imagining the video to include such elements. Does the film use this destruction to dramatize a certain unexpected and undesired occurrence...or is it just slapstick humor relying on the fact that people find things getting broke funny?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't seen the video, but I would imagine that people were upset because there wasn't an absolute need to use actual food for the props - they could have had plastic 'eggs' filled with some yellow liquid, and a cup of water darkened to look like coffee (adding mud might be one way to get a good color for a cup of coffee). In this sense, although the eggs and coffee were used because they were cheaper than the alternative (buying eggs vs. making plastic eggs filled with a yellow liquid), it was still bal tashchlis.</p>\n\n<p>As for the other part of your question, I would posit that those who get upset at a box of eggs being used as a prop would probably also get upset over the wastefulness - both of time and energy - of other forms of filmmaking. Having said that, I think the qualifier would be if the object in question was able to be useable after the action done to it. Throwing some eggs on the ground essentially ruins the eggs from ever being used again. Breaking a pane of glass, for example, can still allow you to melt the glass down and reform it again (similar to the idea that a pot can technically be made rutially pure by making it 'unusable' - making a hole in it - and then reforming it [which has been banned anyway, as the Rabbis feared people forgetting to actually make their pots and pans properly unusable in the first place]).</p>\n\n\n",

If so, what?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I want to know what the <a href=\"http://www.oukosher.org\">OU</a>'s or any other Orthodox kashrut agency's problem is with <a href=\"http://www.trianglek.org/\">Triangle K</a>. I have read about the Ralbag family which founded and runs the Triangle K and they are clearly Orthodox. If so, what is the problem with their hashgacha? <br><br> Please provide sources and facts and not mere conjecture or judgment calls.<br><br>\nI don't mean for this question to arouse a political and/or religious debate, I am purely interested in the facts.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>Every Kosher Agency has its own standards that it adheres to. It has its leniencies that it follows, as well as stringencies. If you don't agree with those leniences, then you won't trust that hechsher.</p>\n\n<p>There are many things that must be taken into account. Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the Kashering process between non-kosher and kosher products run on the same line. </li>\n<li>Transportation. </li>\n<li>The ingredients used (e.g. gelatin)</li>\n<li>the frequency of Mashgichim (inspectors') visits</li>\n<li>Transparency. How easy is it to find out what leniencies the Kosher Agency follows.</li>\n<li>does your level of kashrut observance match up with the koshering agency</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I wasn't able to find the Triangle-K's stance on any of these issues, but <a href=\"http://www.canonist.com/?p=322\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here's an interview</a> (<a href=\"http://archive.is/aqF6L\" rel=\"noreferrer\">archived here</a>) allegedly conducted with Rabbi Ralbag. In it, he specifically mentions two leniencies that many others do not accept:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Others don’t want to accept it, so very good…we depend on ABC…On cooking for wine, someone will say 190, someone will say 180…what we do, we’ll say openly what we do…but it’s al pi halacha…Rav Moshe has a tshuva that when you take grape juice and you cook it…175…by the crush you cook the grapes…even if it’s all done by a non-jew, it’s kosher…only considered non-kosher after it’s separated…we set up one of our large grape-juice suppliers in that way…Even if it’s fully in non-jewish hands…it’s kosher…we put a mashgiach there, but even if he wouldn’t be there, it’s kosher.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, he relies on R' Moshe's leniency with regards to grape juice. He considers mevushal what others would consider non-mevushal, and therefore becomes forbidden to drink when touched by a non-Jew, according to people who do not follow that leniency. </p>\n\n<p>He also says that they follow a leniency about when the grapes can start becoming non-kosher if touched be a non-Jew. When I worked at a winery under the OU's supervision, all the touching was done by the Mashgichim from when the grapes were brought into the processing center, before they even enter the crusher.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What about hard liquor? “We permit hard liquor…even though it’s made in caskets…al pi halacha it’s permitted…stam yaynam…They don’t blend, so far as we found out, they don’t blend any wine…we don’t give a hashgocha on whiskey anyway.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it all depends on what leniencies you're willing to accept. </p>\n\n<p>Also, based on the above (assuming you don't accept these leniencies), you might say I'll stay away from Triangle-K products that contain wine/grape juice, but can eat the rest of their products. But there's something to remember, if they consider the grape 100% kosher, that means they aren't careful to kasher the lines in between grape and non-grape products, since there is nothing wrong with the grape products. This could potentially mean that other products on the same line are \"contaminated\" as well. One might argue that it is all nullified, but maybe not, you have no way of knowing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The OU has (at least) two specific problems with Triangle-K:</p>\n\n<p>1- While halakhah has no minimum bound (shiur) for how often an establishment must be spot-checked (yotzei venichnas = someone who goes and comes), Triangle-K does so far less often than does the OU.</p>\n\n<p>The OU had multiple incidents where staff made it clear that until the OU took over inspection, the staff never expected a Triangle-K employee to stop by, and didn't particularly worry about someone coming by just as they were doing something wrong.</p>\n\n<p>2- Rabbi Ralbag holds that factory equipment self-kashers by doing a run. So, he allows doing a run of non-kosher product, and rather than stopping everything for a full cleaning and kashering, he would do a run of kosher product -- to be wasted or more likely sold as non-kosher. Then the second batch onward of kosher product would be sold as kosher.</p>\n\n<p>(I have a feeling this is the bit about non-kosher and kosher animal fats mentioned in Yishai's answer.)</p>\n\n<p>I also heard about his allowing pasteurized grape juice, but only through the rumor mill. The above two are from a rabbinic supervisor within the OU.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In addition to the Menachem's response above, Triangle K does not require meat products to be glatt kosher, which is a stringency that most American Jews hold by. As far as I know, this is the main reason why people don't go by them. Especially for meat products like Hebrew National hot dogs.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that many people have no problem with eating Triangle-K products that are not meat; however, I can imagine that this lower standard of kashrut might cause people think twice before buying any of their products at all.</p>\n\n\n",

It is quite surprising that those following מנהג פולין, do not follow the latter ruling of the מגן אברהם, although they do follow the former. In אשכנז this מגן אברהם wasn't followed (they had a different interpretation of the גמרא), for example in the ישיבת חתם סופר, unmarried young men covered their heads with a טלית. Today, in most synagogues which follow מנהגי אשכנז, unmarried young men wear a hat, as opposed to putting a טלית over their heads. The מנהג of a married adult men wearing a hat rather than wearing a טלית over the head, was not started by רבוני אשכנז, and on the contrary - the רבנים themselves retained the old מנהג.</p>\n\n<p>אָמַר רַב יִצְחָק בַּר יוֹסֵף אָמַר רְֿבִי יוֹחָנָן \n\"הַיוֹצֵא בְּטַלִית מְקוּפֶּֽלֶת מוּנַֽחַת לוֹ עַל כְּתֵיפוֹ בְּשַׁבָּת חַיָּיב חַטָאת׃\"‏</p>\n\n<p>רב יצחק בר יוסף  stated in the name of רבי יוחנן, \none who goes outs into the public domain \nwith a folded cloak resting on his shoulder on שבת, is liable for a חטאת.</p>\n\n<p>Commentary:\nThe גמרא understands טלית to be a large four-cornered garment similar in size and dimension to the טלית used during תפילה today (ערוך השלחן ס׳ ש״א ס״ק פ״א); see also (ערוך השלחן ס׳ ש״א ס״ק ל״א). In Talmudic times, this garment was a normal part of daily attire (ריטב״א). It was generally worn draped over the head and shoulders in such a way that most of one’s body would be covered by it; the sides of the cloak would flow down one’s arms, and the end of the cloak would extend down one’s back towards the floor (see רש״י and ערוך השלחן ad loc.). Here, though, the גמרא discusses a case where the cloak was not worn in this manner. Instead of allowing the cloak to drape behind him, the person lifted the back end of the garment onto his shoulders, in effect folding the cloak in half width-size (רש״י). His purpose in doing so was presumably to guard against the end of the cloak touching the ground and becoming soiled or ripped (see ערוך השלחן ad loc.). Since this is not the normal way the cloak is worn, the person is deemed to be carrying the garment rather than wearing it (see רש״י here and above, דף נ״ה, ד״ה חייב חטאת), and carrying from a private to a public domain is prohibited on שבת. [Since the cloak is not usually worn in this manner, the person cannot be said to be wearing the garment (see אורח חיים ס׳ ש״א ס״ק כ״ט, ל׳).]</p>\n\n<p>בני אשכנז were מקפיד not to fold the טלית over their shoulders, but to wrap their bodies in it, to wear it like a blanket. The טלית is considered clothing, not just something resting on one’s shoulders. The חזן would wear it the same way as חזנים wear it today in קהילות אשכנז. This is discussed at length by רבי אליעזר רוקח. The רוקח’s opinion is as follows, a) one should have two ציציות in the front and two in the back, (Those who wished to follow his opinion, would wrap two ציציות back around their neck!) According to the ancient מנהג this was not done, as most people were not מקפיד. People by not folding the טליתות over their shoulders, might cause their ציציות to drag on the floor, this does not pose a halachic problem. (Those who wish to wear their טלית in a similar way to the ancient מנהג, and don't want to have the ציציות on the floor, should tuck in the bottom ציציות through their belt, in this way they fulfill all מנהגים.) The רוקח’s opinion is quoted by the דרכי חיים ושלום (Munkaczer מנהגים Paragraph 35 of the footnotes). This was also the מנהג of many חסידים in the Ukraine and surrounding regions, including those of Chernobyl, Skver, Karlin-Stolin, and Belz.</p>\n\n\n",

The whole problem with talking in between making the bracha and the concluding act of eating is that you are taking the attention away from the main activity of the moment - waiting for the bracha to be said. Although playing with your fingers is not related to this, as long as it's not disruptive, it should have the same status as adjusting your seat when you sit down at the table.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I did not find any sources which explicitly address this (which is itself somewhat telling), but we could try to construct a picture based on the cases that are discussed.</p>\n<p>There are two parts to the question, as with all discussions of hefsek.  1 - Is this something you are allowed to do? 2 - Is this something that, if I have done it, will cause me to need to make a new blessing?</p>\n<p>I think part 2 is easier to draw support that in your case you would not need to make a new blessing:</p>\n<p>Rashi (Berachos 40a) s.v. טול ברוך, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואף על גב דשיחה הויא הפסקה כדאמרינן במנחות (פרק ג' דף לו.) סח בין תפילין לתפילין צריך לברך</p>\n<p>(Summary) Conversation is a hefsek, as we say regarding Tefillin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi understands that the laws of hefsek from birkas hamitzvah can be extrapolated to Hamotzi (and presumably all birkas hanehenin).</p>\n<p>By Tefillin, the Mishna Berura 25:29 cites the Artzos Hachaim (Malbim) that לכתחילה you should not interrupt by making gestures with your fingers or hinting with your eyes.  But if you did, it would not constitute grounds to need a new blessing.  Tapping your fingers, even very consciously and intently, is no worse than that, and tapping mindlessly is surely much better.  Therefore, I think it is safe to conclude that you would not need to make a new blessing.</p>\n<p>Part 1 is not as easy to support so directly.

These all seem to have the common denominator of being related to communication in some way.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura (Shaar Hatziyun 167:28) extends this issue to walking around.</p>\n<p>No one seems to extend the issue to something done mindlessly, so that would <em>seem</em> to be okay.  If you were doing it with serious intent, it is still not included in the list of things mentioned explicitly.  Perhaps it could be on a level comparable to walking around, but in my mind it is less of a real \"action\" to just play with your fingers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>see משנה ברורה ס'רו ס''ק יב who says clearly so long as one did not talk after the bracha it is only a hefsek if he is מסיח דעת which means so long as he didn't start thinking about something else, and take off his mind what he is waiting for (or talk) it is not a hefsek and he does not (and can not) make another bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore the verse is saying that <strong>the one who is truly blessed is the one who recognizes that everything comes from Hashem</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Yaakov vowed, saying, 'If Hashem will be with me and guard me on the way which I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothes to wear...'\"(Bereshit 28:20) Yaakov was saying, \"I always feel that Hakadosh Baruch Hu, watches over me, and provides me with bread to eat and clothes to wear.\"\n   \"May I return in peace to my father's house\"(Bereshit) Rashi comments \"In peace -- without sin, not learning from the cunning of Lavan, not being led astray by anybody or anything in this world.\n   \"Then Hashem will be my G-d\" (Ibid) Then it will be ingrained in my heart that Hashem is G-d, there is no other than Him, no external power other than His.

I know a family that would not have played it on <em>Shabas</em> because of the restriction on playing games that use writing. To allow themselves to play it on <em>Shabas</em>, they developed an alternate scoring system: instead of writing scores, they kept scores by placing bookmarks in books. (If a player's score was 127, he placed his bookmark between pages 126 and 127, facing page 127.) They used this method during the week also, so that the game became, for them, one in which writing was not utilized, and they could play it on <em>Shabas</em>. Is this valid?</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I'm not asking for an halachic ruling here: everyone should consult his own rabbi. I'm asking, rather, for arguments and sources pro and con.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Maybe the answer to your question would be in the same line as the Issur of buying, selling, and renting on Shabbos which are a Gezaira lest one comes to write -see Shulchan Aruch Horav 306:4. (In other words, what if I never write when I sell anything, am I exempt from this Issur? -I don't think so.)\nThere is also another problem with certain games on Shabbos: Shtorei Hedyotos (see Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim Siman 307) which is a Gzeiro lest one come to erase (see Shulchan Aruch Horav 307:22).\nIn either case they would not include chess, checkers, Chamisha Avonim (jacks), othello...\nYou may want to see Shulchan Aruch Horav 338:6 concerning games.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Scrabble is a bit of a gray area, as if you use loose tiles there are some who don't say putting the tiles together as a word counts as 'writing' (though I'd imagine they are in the minority); still, because you are forming words, even though it's of a temporary nature, it would be rabinically forbidden (in the same way that writing your name on some frost on your window would be rabinically forbidden, even though it's temporary).</p>\n\n<p>Games like Uno, on the other hand, don't involve writing. Keeping score by putting a card in the page of a book is a novel way of keeping score. I don't have any idea if that would be considered a problem. However, I can imagine that some people would still object, as there is the very real possibility of losing the score you had if the card falls out of the book, and you then might either write your score down or make some alteration to the page (giving a little tear on a page, for example) to mark your score.</p>\n\n\n",

It is in the Merkavah literature and the Zohar that the 6 pointed star is given significance.  The Star of David is seen as the star that connects the sephirah of Malchut to the 6 sefirot above it.  Malchut is a sefira that is associated with King David.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting note regarding the Star of David is that in Lurianic Kabbalah the seder plate is placed in such a way as to create two overlapping triangles. <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/18012547/GERSHOM-SCHOLEM-THE-CURIOUS-HISTORY-OF-THE-SIXPOINTED-STAR\" rel=\"nofollow\">As per Gershom article</a> where he tries to claim that it does not say such a thing.

The origin of the star is as a magical symbol, and it can be seen in amulets such as those written by R. Yonatan Eybeschuetz, for example, but long before as well, and not specifically in Jewish sources. According to Scholem, \"The prime motive behind the wide diffusion of the sign in the 19th century was the desire to imitate Christianity. The Jews looked for a striking and simple sign which would 'symbolize' Judaism in the same way as the cross symbolizes Christianity\" (Scholem, Kabbalah, 367-68). </p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein, in a teshuva about a whether there is a problem in having a parochet with a Magen David, says that there is no problem, even though the Magen David has no source, because it has been used by Jews for hundreds of years (before its adoption by the Zionist movement): </p>\n\n<p>שו\"ת אגרות משה אורח חיים חלק ג סימן טו: בדבר הפרוכת שיש עליו צורת מגן דוד אם יש בזה איזה חשש, הנה כפי שידוע זה מאות בשנים שעשו ציור מגן דוד על פרכות ועל מעילים ומטפחות ולא היה מי שיערער על זה, ואף שאין לנו מקור צורת המגן דוד אין בזה שום קפידא, וגם יש בזה ענין להזכיר שהשי\"ת מלך למעלה ולמטה ולכל ד' רוחות השמים, ושייכות שם דוד לא ידוע, ואולי הוא סימן לדוד שבטח במלחמותיו על השי\"ת שהוא מלך למעלה ולמטה ובכל רוחות השמים שלכן לא היה ירא ממלכי בשר ודם ומחיילותיהם כציוי התורה. אבל בכל אופן אף אם הוא בלא טעם איני רואה בדבר שעשו כן זה מאות בשנים קודם שהיו כת הציונים בעולם כלל ולא היו מינים וכופרים בבתי כנסיות כלל שיהיה בזה חשש איסור ואף לא משום מעשה לא טוב. ורשאין להניחן על כלי הקדש ואין צורך לקורען משם. ומה שכתבו גם תיבת ציון לא מתייחד זה להכת ציונים ולא מחלוקת טוב להסיר אותיות אלו כי צורת המגן דוד שעשו מכבר על כלי הקדש היה בלא תיבת ציון, אבל ענין איסור ליכא בזה כלל. ומש\"כ בספר אוצר דינים ומנהגים שאסור לעשות ציור וכל דמות לאות אמונה אין לזה שום מקור ולא שום טעם לחלוק בזה על דורות שלפנינו שהניחו לעשות זה. והנני ידידו מוקירו, משה פיינשטיין.</p>\n\n\n",

I, though, will not eat [cheese] at this meal, but I will do so at the next meal” (Chullin 105a). Mar Ukva’s father was super-stringent and went beyond the requirements, whereas Mar Ukva went according to the letter of the law.</p>\n  \n  <p>Mar Ukva’s practice of “waiting until the next meal” is seen by halachic sources as being the basis for the requirement to wait after eating meat before eating dairy. Posekim, however, do not agree on how long Mar Ukva waited. Some opine that Mar Ukva simply provided us with a general rule: Do not combine dairy and meat at the same meal; and, if you eat a meat meal, you cannot have dairy until the meat meal has been completed. Any further waiting is optional. Others maintain that Mar Ukva advocated waiting a specific duration of time, and that this is what halachah requires.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch presents various approaches. In Yoreh Deah 89:1, Rabbi Yosef Karo—whose authority is binding on most Sephardic Jews—states in no uncertain terms that one must wait six hours after consuming meat before eating dairy. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Rema—whom Ashkenazic Jews follow—who posits that the rule is to not consume meat and dairy in the same meal. While Rema maintains that, according to the letter of the law, one may eat a meat meal, recite Birkat Hamazon and then immediately begin a dairy meal, he asserts that Ashkenazic Jewry has accepted the custom of waiting between meals, and this is a practice that is binding on all Ashkenazim.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rema further explains that though the custom in his community (Krakow) was to wait an hour between meals, one should wait six hours. Nowadays, most Jews wait six hours, though Dutch Jews wait one hour, and German Jews wait three hours.</p>\n  \n  <p>(It should be noted that instead of stating that one must wait six hours between eating meat and dairy, Rambam [Hilchot Ma’achalot Asurot 9:28] states that one must wait “about six hours.” Rambam’s intent is a point of dispute among halachic authorities. Some interpret this to allow for a five-and-a-half-hour waiting period.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Why are there such diverse views on waiting?</p>\n  \n  <p>It all goes back to Mar Ukva’s statement about waiting “until the next meal.” Some interpret the “next meal” to mean six hours, the average amount of time from lunch to dinner or from a late breakfast—“brunch”—to dinner. (In Talmudic days, most people ate only two meals: “brunch” and dinner.) Others believe Mar Ukva meant that one should wait an hour, the amount of time it takes for digestion to begin (Chochmat Adam 40:13). Those who wait three hours may understand Mar Ukva to be referring to the interval between breakfast and lunch, rather than that between lunch and dinner.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sephardic Jews must wait six hours as a matter of halachah; there is no room for divergent customs or leniencies (unless there is a medical need, of course). Ashkenazim, however, wait as a matter of accepted custom, similar to the Ashkenazic custom to refrain from eating kitniyot on Pesach. For Ashkenazim, it is always necessary, however, to recite the required berachot upon completing a meat meal before eating dairy. The berachot serve to separate the meals.</p>\n  \n  <p>If—after waiting the requisite period of time—one finds meat stuck between his teeth, he must cleanse his teeth and rinse his mouth. There is no need to wait any longer. (There is also a machloket regarding the one-hour period. Some posekim rule that a person who always waits one hour needs to clean his mouth before eating dairy, whereas others disagree.)</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My personal understanding/interpretation of the basis of waiting (the story told in the Gemara), is that, basically, Mar 'Ukva is saying a couple of things.<br>\n<strong>1</strong>. His father was very pious, and he himself is not nearly so pious, though he admires his father's piety of waiting 24 hours between meat and cheese.<br>\n<strong>2</strong>. He thinks it is appropriate to wait until the next meal to eat cheese (if this meal is with meat).<br>\n<strong>3</strong>. He thinks it is minimally appropriate (if not required; this is ambiguous) to at least not eat cheese with this (meat) meal.  </p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, I think how we derive minimum lengths of time depends on how we view these statements. We have a couple of options that I can think of:<br>\n<strong>A</strong>. His statements are meant to be precise measures of time - wait the exact amount of time one would normally wait between meals, or<br>\n<strong>B</strong>. His statements are meant to be situationally dependent - don't eat cheese in this (meat) meal, but wait until the next meal, whenever that is; by the way, if you are offered a snack of cheese between the meals, it's better to wait but it's ok if you eat it. or<br>\n<strong>C</strong>. Very similar to B., except delete the part after the semi-colon (no cheesy snacks allowed).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.il/2015/01/three-hours-after-meat.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Doseofhalacha.com</a> address the custom of waiting 3 hours to eat milk after meat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Question</strong>: I’ve always waited three hours after eating meat before eating milky foods though was recently told that this custom has no basis and I must wait 6 hours.

According to many poskim (Chochmas Adam 40:13, Pischei Teshuva 87:4, and Aruch Hashulchan 89:7) this means six complete hours, while others (Ohr Yitzchak YD 4) write that it means over five and a half hours.</p>\n  \n  <p>Dutch Jews follow the Rema (YD 89:1) and wait just one hour or seventy two minutes (Kreisi Upleisi 89:3).\n  Many Jews, especially in the UK, follow the German custom of waiting three hours, though there is a debate as to the origin of this view.\n  Indeed, many of the German poskim themselves write that one should wait six hours (Horeb 453; Kreisi Upleisi 89:3).</p>\n  \n  <p>Many quote Rabbeinu Yerucham (Kitzur Issur Veheter 39) who mentions waiting three hours, though R’ Asher Zvi Lunzer (Madanei Asher 41) claims that this is a misprint as in the unabridged sefer (Sefer Adam 15:28) he writes that one must wait at least six hours.\n  Shorshei Minhag Ashkenaz writes that there is no real source though postulates that the three hours came about by German Jews who originally kept one hour who later wanted to compromise with those waiting six hours.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Darkei Teshuva (89:6) and Mizmor Ledovid (YD 89:6) explain that it is based on the short winter days when people would typically wait three hours between their meals or that it is based on the calculation of shaos zemanios (halachic hours that vary by season).\n  Irrespective of the source, waiting three hours after meat has become a real minhag mentioned among the contemporary poskim (See Yabia Omer YD 1:4:12), and one who already waits three hours does not need to change one’s minhag to wait six hours (Madanei Asher).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As far as I can tell no one has mentioned a very interesting side note that Rambam makes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5209.htm#25\" rel=\"noreferrer\">מאכלות אסורות ט</a></p>\n  \n  <p>כה  [כו] מי שאכל גבינה או חלב תחילה--מותר לאכול אחריו בשר מיד, וצריך\n  שידיח ידיו ויקנח פיו בין הגבינה ובין הבשר.  <strong>ובמה יקנח פיו--בפת או\n  בפירות, שלועסן ובולען או פולטן</strong>; ובכול מקנחין את הפה--חוץ מתמרים או\n  קמח או ירקות, שאין אלו מקנחין יפה.</p>\n  \n  <p>כו  [כז] במה דברים אמורים, בבשר בהמה או חיה; אבל אם אכל בשר עוף אחר\n  שאכל הגבינה או החלב, אינו צריך לא קינוח הפה ולא נטילת ידיים.</p>\n  \n  <p>כז  [כח] מי שאכל בשר בתחילה, בין בשר בהמה בין בשר עוף--לא יאכל אחריו\n  חלב עד שישהה ביניהן כדי שיעור סעודה אחרת, והוא כמו שש שעות:  <strong>מפני\n  הבשר של בין השיניים, שאינו סר בקינוח.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He first talks about meat after milk, saying that it's permissible immediately and you simply wash your hands and clean your mouth by chewing on bread or fruit, which you can either swallow or spit out.</p>\n\n<p>He then discusses milk after meat, saying one should wait the amount of time between two meals, which is <em>about</em> six hours.  The interesting part is at the very end where he gives an explicit reason for waiting so long - because of the meat stuck between your teeth and the fact that the method of cleaning your mouth used after milk doesn't work to remove the meat from between your teeth.  <em>About</em> six hours is how long it takes for all the meat bits to be dislodged from between your teeth.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it would seem to imply that if you had a method to thoroughly remove any meat bits from between your teeth then at least theoretically you could eat milk immediately after meat, at least according to Rambam's understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

But how do they reconcile this with the people (especially people in the Torah) who lived longer? I will quote <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=142\">Abarbanel</a> on the topic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין להקשות על זה מה שהקשה הראב״ע שאחר זה חיו בני אדם נח והאבות יותר מק״כ כי לא היתה הכונה בגזרה הזאת שמיד ולדורות יתחילו האנשים לחיות זה המספר מהשנים כי איך יתכן שיעתקו השנים מן הקצה אל הקצה פתאום אלא שילך חיות בני אדם ומספר ימיהם הולך ומתמעט בחסרון בירידה תמידית עד שיגיע אל הגבול ההוא ושם יעמוד הטבע האנושי ולא יוסיף</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So not that the lifespan would revert immediately from the 800-900 range to 120, but rather that the lifespan would gradually decrease to like 400-500 years in the generations after Noach, to the 150-200 years in the times of the Avos, finally to 120 after the time of Moshe, who actually lived to 120.</p>\n\n<p>Now what about the people after Moshe who lived longer that 120 years? (This means <strong>born</strong> after Moshe, for clearly Pinchas lived a very very long time, and this doesn't bother anyone.) Well, one could answer that Abarbanel and likeminded commentators weren't aware of anyone post-Moshe living past 120, and based their interpretations accordingly. But, I don't think this would even pose much of a problem to their interpretation. Another quote from Abarbanel (linked above):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומשה בן מאה ועשרים שנה במותו לא כהתה עינו ולא נס לחה ועל זה נאמר לו הן קרבו ימיך למות כי היתה הקורבה ההיא הגזרה שנגזרה בכלל על בני אדם. וכן אהרן חי קכ״ג שנים שהם בכלל ק״כ שנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aharon, who lived to 123, lived \"within the bound of 120\". In other words, the limit is not 120 as much as \"120 give or take\", or \"in the 120s\".</p>\n\n<p>The people who we find living past 120 do not live much longer than 120, maybe a few years at best.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra discusses this in Gen 6:3</p>\n\n<p>אבן עזרא בראשית ו:ג </p>\n\n<p>והיו ימיו י\"א שזה קצב כל האדם. ואם מצאנו יותר כן, מצאנו מעט, רק על הרוב ידבר. ואין זה אמת, כי הנה שם חיה שש מאות, וכל הדורות אחריו חיו שנים רבות. ובימי פלג חסרו השנים. ומימות דוד עד היום שבעים או שמונים שנה. והאמת מה שאמר המתרגם ארמית שנתן קץ לאדם, כטעם עוד ארבעים יום (יונה ג, ד). ואם ישובו ימלטו, ואם לא ישובו וימותו. ואל תשים לבך אל מספר ויהי נח בן חמש מאות שנה (ברא' ה, לב) כי אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה. והנה כתוב וימת תרח בחרן (ברא' יא, לב), ואחריו ויאמר ד' אל אברם לך לך מארצך (שם יב, א). ואנחנו נדע, כי לא מת תרח עד שהי' יצחק בן ל\"ה שנה. ורבים כמוהו:</p>\n\n<p>He rejects the reading of this passuk as a maximal lifetime and concurs with Rashi that it means that God warned the people 120 years before the flood.</p>\n\n<p>Hence it seems the general tradition is a misconception.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have since found the following information about people that did live over 120 years in the Bible AFTER Moses.

Can anyone find more details?\nThanks.</p>\n\n<p>Ahijah, the prophet of Shiloh, instigated Jeroboam's secession and predicted the downfall of his kingdom. The Midrash, basing itself on the fact that, according to 2 Chronicles 9:29, Ahijah is described as extremely aged in Jeroboam's time (1 Kings 14:4), and with no pedigree, identified him with Ahiah, son of Ahitub, the oracle-giving priest at Shiloh in King Saul's time (1 Samuel 14:3). He is accordingly singled out by rabbinical tradition as one of the seven long-lived saints whose successive lives extend over the whole history of mankind; each having transmitted the sacred lore from his predecessor to the one succeeding him, while shielding the generations of his time by means of his piety. These saints are: (1) Adam; (2) Methuselah; (3) Shem (Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xxiv.); (4) Jacob (Gen. R. xciv.); (5) Serah, the daughter of Asher, or, as others have it, Amram, the father of Moses; (6) Ahijah of Shiloh; (7) Elijah the prophet, who lives until the coming of the Messiah (Ab. R. N. version B. xxxviii., Seder 'Olam R. i., and B. B. 121b). For the underlying idea, see Ḥag. 12b, and Yoma, 38b, with reference to Proverbs 10:25, Heb., \"The righteous is the foundation of the world,\" and Proverbs 9:1, \"Wisdom hath hewn seven pillars.\" According to this tradition Ahijah lived over six hundred years, having received his \"wisdom\" from either Amram, the father of Moses (see Amram), or from Serah, the daughter of Asher (see Serah).</p>\n\n<p>If from Serah, his age was considerably less, since she was supposed to have lived for more than four hundred years, until the days of David (YalḲ., Sam. § 152). The reason why Ahijah was regarded as having attained so unusual an age seems to be that, according to 2 Chronicles 9:29, the history of Solomon's reign was written by him; and that he was supposed to be identical with Ahijah the Levite, who was placed by King David in charge of the treasures of the house of God and of the treasures of the dedicated things (1 Chronicles 26:20; see B. B. 121b, Rashi).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is a woman's obligation when it comes to prayer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Orthodox practice, it is commonly thought that women are not obligated to say prayers (or some parts of them, anyway) due to its time-bound nature.  In reality, what is a woman's obligation?  Which prayers must she say, and when must she say them?  A list from a reputable source would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Women are exempt from saying the Shema, as it is a positive time bound commandment. However, it is proper for them to read the first verse, in order to accept God's kingship daily. (Shulchan Aruch 70:1.)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=338\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch in OC 106</a> says that women are obligated in prayer - implying Shmone Esrei. The Magen Avraham there adds that he doesn't see many women praying all three tefillot. He attempts to justify the practice by saying that the obligation of the women is to say a short prayer at some point once during the day. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=260\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura</a> there, and many modern decisors (see Piskei Teshuvot there), all agree that the Magen Avraham's reasoning is a limmud zechut, and that women should attempt to daven the full Shemone Esrei. (Rav Chaim Brisk is quoted [<em>Nefesh Harav</em> p. 103] as saying that the words of the Magen Avraham are תמוהים מאד וכשגגה היוצא מפי השליט.)</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura there adds that since maariv is a reshut, just that men have accepted it upon themselves as an obligation, it's possible that women never accepted it upon themselves. As such, women may need to daven maariv only as a reshut. Not all poskim agree with the Mishna Brurah's distinction: e.g. <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch HaShulchan</a> there and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16059/759\">Rav Joseph B. Soloveitchik</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of the blessings before and after Shema, women should be exempt, as they have no need to say Shema. However, since Ashkenazi Jews can say blessings they are exempt from, it might be a good idea to say at least the last blessing. This allows for semichat geulah le'tfillah.</p>\n<p>Pesukei D'zimra seems to be an introduction to Shmoneh Esrei, and it seems women should be equally obligated.

However, they are obligated to perform mitzvot that are not bound by time.

But:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A woman who is engaged in childcare -- though not other forms of business, no matter how worthwhile -- can become exempt from literally all prayer, insofar as the time would otherwise be spent on childcare. (This includes morning blessings. I would imagine it does not include blessings on food, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I was told by a reasonably trustworthy authority that there has never been a community in which women actually prayed twice a day. I don't know if this was based on the fact that women with children are allowed to daven less, or that no community has ever actually followed the rule as written. It sounded like the latter. According to the authority, there is thus in some sense permission for women to pray less than twice a day.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Women who pray shacharis are subject to more lenient restrictions than men re: eating and doing other tasks before prayer. Women are also subject to more leniency with regards to z'manim and (especially) synagogue attendance. This is true for all women, including those without children. As far as I understand, synagogue attendance during prayer is literally never required of women. (That said, she may have to go to synagogue for other reasons, such as to hear the Megillah, which is indeed required.)</p>\n<p>There are very few prayers required of women apart from the Amidah(s). Women are supposed to say \"Shema Yisroel\" once a day in order to accept upon themselves the Yoke of Heaven. Apart from a few prayers -- especially holiday prayers -- in which it is customary for women to participate, that's basically it.</p>\n<p>Less important, but interesting: For some reason, the brachos following the Shema, particularly the first, are considered even more important than the full Shema for women. If praying before halachic midday, she is supposed to say as much of the Shema as she has time for (e.g. one paragraph [!]) and then the first bracha after Shema. (I wonder if this has anything to do with the importance of saying the word \"Emes\" after kriyas Shema; it's just a theory...)</p>\n<p>Yom Kippur Ne'ilah and Vidui, and Mussaf of Yom Tov (especially of Rosh Hashanah) were pointed out as being especially important for women to say. I can't remember if this was given as halacha or just a \"strong\" custom. In any case, even these requirements do not apply to women who are busy with childcare.</p>\n<p>Source: Rigshei Lev, Rabbi Menachem Nissel, 2001</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Original answer</h1>\n<p>I have heard everything from \"women's prayer obligation is fulfilled by saying the morning blessings\" to \"women must say shacharit, minchah, and maariv on schedule every day.\" The most common opinion I have encountered, however, seems to be that women should daven a minimum of once a day in addition to brachos.</p>\n<p>(I hesitate to say this, because I don't remember the source, but <em>it is possible</em> that women don't have to follow the z'manim, but can daven when they please.)</p>\n<p>If following the z'manim, many women prefer to pray shacharis and/or minchah. Minchah supposedly has a special relevance for women. It is common to find women who say minchah only, and/or shacharis and minchah, daily. Maariv is the service least commonly said by women, although there are women who say it every day.</p>\n<p>As for what they should daven, I was taught by Chabad that this is the minimum daily davening for women:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hareini. (The AriZal said everyone should initiate davening by saying this: \"Hareini mekabel alai mitzvas asei shel ve-ahavta le-re’akha kamokha - Behold, I accept upon myself the positive commandment to 'love your fellow Jew as yourself.' \" (Leviticus 19:18). These days, I don't know of anyone who does it other than Chabad, but I am not an expert.)</li>\n<li>Korbanot: Tamid (continual) offering only. (A Chareidi [litvish] dayan I talked to suggested that ketoret be said, too.)</li>\n<li>Shema Yisroel</li>\n<li>Amidah</li>\n<li>Ach Tzadikim</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is recommended to add more parts of the service as time and learning permit.</p>\n<h3>Non-Obligatory Davening</h3>\n<p>Whether or not it is technically required, women generally say the bedtime Shema.</p>\n<p>I learned we are supposed to say \"Shema Yisroel\" at least three times a day: upon waking, at night, and once in between. However, this is not a halachic requirement. (I doubt it's minhag yisroel, either -- minhag beis Yaakov? -- but it might be.)</p>\n<p>Daily Psalms, such as the chapter for your age, are encouraged and said by many women.</p>\n<p>There are some traditional prayers that women say for holidays, Shabbos, erev and motzoei Shabbos/holidays, and Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n<p>There is a custom for women to recite the entire book of Psalms on Shabbos Mvor'chim. Update: Not sure how widespread this is or if it is primarily Chasidic. I know that in Chabad, everyone including the men [tries] to say all of Tehillim on Shabbot M'vor'chim, and that elsewhere it is a custom among women, but I don't know where.</p>\n\n\n",

Since a person in a public domain has an halachic ownership of a surrounding 4 amos, every 4 amos is considered a different domain.  One who carries more than 4 amos accomplishes the same as a \"motzi\".</p>\n\n<p>So walking >4 amos w/o washing may be less of an issue of measurement and more of place:  Don't leave your domain without washing.  >4 cubit inside a house would not be an issue.</p>\n\n\n",

He eloquently argues that seating men and women in the same room, at separate tables, with no <em>mechitza</em> is more than satisfactory; and has mixed feelings about mixed tables. (I recall elsewhere in Bnei Banim he argues for supervised mixed singles events.) He argues that the verse in Zechariah quoted by many naysayers was only intended for prayer services, Torah-study sessions, and the like.</p>\n<p>A few key quotes from the essay:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When <em>sheva brachot</em> were held at my grandfather's apartment [Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, the primary Halachic decisor for America in the 1940s and 1950s], the organizers seated my wife in a corner outside the dining room with a handful of women. I protested ... the feast is called \"the rejoicing of the groom and bride\" ... [w]here is the rejoicing of the bride? My grandfather accepted my words but said that it is difficult to contest an established practice, but I think anyone who is able to should protest. ...</p>\n<p>Still ... mingling of men and women should be forbidden at weddings where there is often <em>kalut rosh</em> [lightheadedness] ... Perhaps the community relies on the fact that drunkenness at weddings today is not common. [My comment: I wish...] ...</p>\n<p>I have thus presented many reasons to exonerate the practice of mixed seating. Nonetheless, when it is not completely necessary one should not purify the impure. <em>Hirhur</em> [sinful thoughts] exists at many weddings today, especially among unmarried youths ... [f]or this reason it would be better to seat male and female teenagers separately, even if couples sit together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He <a href=\"http://www.yasharbooks.com/2004/12/seating-arrangements-at-weddings.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">later added</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I retract what I wrote... that at weddings it is proper to seat single men and single women separately even if the married couples sit together. This is [still] so with young men and women who are not yet ready to get married. However, regarding those who have reached that stage, to the opposite, it is a mitzvah so that they get to know each other in a place where there is no concern for yihud and each couple is not alone on a \"date,\" as is done today...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In 1937 or so, my paternal grandparents went on singles-mixer boat rides, and met one another at a singles-mixer weekend in the Pine View Hotel in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallsburg,_New_York\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fallsburg, New York</a>, which events were hosted by Zeirei Agudath Israel, now (and maybe then?) a division of Agudath Israel of America. (Zeirei's major aim was to keep young American Jews religious, a heavy concern at that time. I doubt AIA would operate such mixers today.) While this is not the rabbinical authority sought in the question, it's an organization that I strongly suspect operated under the guidance of such authority; see also the comments on this answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Two points on mixed seating at weddings:</p>\n\n<p>Shalom has already mentioned the mixed seating situation at the wedding of Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, the senior Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS (Yeshiva University) and son-in-law of HaRav Moshe Feinstein, the posek hadir (that generation's greatest decider of Jewish law) of the 20th century.  But the kicker of that story is Rabbi Tendler's ironic comment that: \"some people would say that this was wrong and that my father-in-law didn't know the halacha . . . .\"  </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Berel Wein, shlita, in what I believe was his recorded lectures on \"The Lost Communities,\" said that before World War II, a great many gedolim outside of Hungary were married at weddings with mixed seating at the dinner.  He said he even had photographs and intended to publish them in his book.  But, he said, the prevailing custom today follows the Hungarian practice of no mixed seating.  He explained that we follow the Hungarian custom because a larger percentage of them survived the war (about 50 percent) than from the rest of Europe.  He added that his publisher refused to publish the photos of the pre-war weddings because of a fear of a backlash from Hungarian-influenced rabbis who would see the photos as an intentional effort to undermine their customs.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, back in the early 1980s, I went to a wedding of the son of a Bobover Hasid who was originally from the city of Auschwitz, Poland.  They had separate seating for the rabbis and their wives -- with a mechitza around them, separate seating for young marrieds, mixed seating for much older couples, and mixed seating for young singles (so they could meet).  We never figured out the logic of this.</p>\n\n\n",

Presumably to imply that there are a series of rungs for the transition up and down -- to prepare Yaakov for his life that's about to shift gears dramatically.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The ladder in the dream is interpreted according to the theme of interpretation one uses for the rest of the dream. The commentators vary drastically with respect to the interpretation and purpose of Yaakov's dream, and thus each to his own regarding what the ladder represents as well. For most, the ladder in the dream is just as symbolic as the angels going up and down on it.</p>\n\n<p>But let us pick out Rashi's (actually Chazal's) interpretation of the dream. It was to show Yaakov the special nature of Eretz Yisrael over that of Chutz La'aretz in that the angels that accompany one in Israel are not those that do so outside of the land. (Presumably those in the land are of a higher level than the others.) In this case, the ladder, as @Shalom mentioned, is just a device of the dream. It was to emphasize the fact that the previous angels were leaving, going back to where they came from (the heavens), and others were taking their place.</p>\n\n<p>According to most, though, angels do not and cannot take on physical bodies. Thus, it would be absurd to suggest that they require a physical ladder to travel back and forth from anywhere, let alone the heavens.

He came to Rabbeinu Hakadosh and said, \"this is certainly not my son, since we're both black where did it come to be born this?\", and he wanted to divorce her (for committing adultery).</p>\n<p>Rebbi asked him: \"Do you have pictures in your house?\". \"Yes\", he replied.<br />\n\"Are they of white or black (people)?\". \"White\", he said.<br />\nSo Rebbi said: \"When your wife looked, during relations, at pictures like this, it caused a child like this\", and its similar to Yaakov's sheep\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would seem to mean that this is in fact a natural thing.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Additionally, as @avi reminded me, there are many references throughout Torah that what the parents have in mind, or look at, or where they are, during relations will strongly impact their child. The effects it can have range from looks (like <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=20&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Yochanan</a>), to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=112b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sicknesses</a>, to the garments of the soul (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tanya, explaining Zohar and Zohar Chadash</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&pentid=P845#C573\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan quotes</a> Kabbalistic sources that he was using meditation \"to direct spiritual energy and actually to change the genetic structure of the sheep ... manipulating some of the highest spiritual forces that exist.\" Okay, as I'm neither a Kabbalist nor a bioengineer, I'll take his word for it ...</p>\n\n<p>The simplest way to read the whole story (as I see it) is that whatever breed of livestock they had back then, two white sheep would occasionally give birth to a brown or spotted one. Let's assume that brown/spotted is the recessive trait, and white is the dominant one. So probability would have if both male and female sheep are carriers of the brown/spotted trait, there's a 25% chance the offspring will be brown/spotted. If so, when Yaakov is given a vision of spotted sheep mating, what he's likely seeing is a representation of the recessive trait (spotted) winning out each time. Effectively, Yaakov was doing a bunch of coin tosses and hoping to get heads every time. </p>\n\n<p>Now it appears that G-d prefers to bend the rules of nature slightly more often than bend them drastically, and he does that more often than break them entirely. So here it's just a matter of tweaking the probabilities. If so, there are several explanations of what Yaakov is doing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It was believed at the time that external influence can bend the probabilities, and thus Yaakov is doing his appropriate <em>hishtadlut</em> (physical effort). It could be that Yaakov himself believed this worked; or that he didn't but he needed a plausible mechanism in the eyes of Lavan and other skeptics before asking for this minor miracle. </li>\n<li>External influence does somehow do something, within the realm of biological possibility. Don't ask me how or when or why.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regardless, the message Lavan is getting is that external influence makes a difference -- which further drives home Yaakov's point that it's best for his family to get out of Mesopotamia and go back their family in Canaan. </p>\n\n\n",

Although the Talmud appears to say that this refers only to a person's second marriage, and this is Rashi's explanation, others explain that it refers to the first marriage as well (see Maharasha, Be'er Sheva, Chatam Sofer 7 34, Yad haMelech Teshuva 5).

    "content": "# What is the basis for eating in someone's house without a kashrut certificate?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>No one asks for a kashrut certificate to eat in someone's house; they just make a rough  judgement based on the host's reputation (the way they dress or behave, the circles they move in, etc.). That level of laxity would not be allowed in any other kashrut-related decision.</p>\n\n<p>I had the funny idea for <a href=\"http://joshuafox.com/hashgocho-pratis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hasgacha Pratit</a>, a kashrut certification organization for  private homes -- Don't even <em>think</em> of taking that seriously! But if you do, cut me in :-) </p>\n\n<p>It is not just a matter of trust. You might ask your host \"Do you keep kosher?\" And the host might honestly say \"Yes.\" Some Jews sincerely think that not having pork and shrimp in the house is enough for one to \"keep kosher\". Some follow ingredient labels and don't require hashgochas. Some Jews rely on hashgochas that other Jews reject.</p>\n\n<p>You might have the chutzpah to pry a little, but lemayseh, few guests quiz their host on the details -- certainly not on the level they would demand for any other source of food. Usually, if the guest \"acts frum\", that's enough.</p>\n\n<p>So: Why do people treat kashrut in other people's homes so leniently?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: \nApparently it is more common than I believed for guests to query their  hosts \"What hashgochas do you accept? You do separate milk and meat dishes,  right?\", \"Do you use meat-based gelatin?\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>I still think that such questions are not as widespread as one might think, and that general guests rely on vague impressions given by the clothing the host wears or the shul  they belong to, but that goes a long way towards an answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 30)\n\n<p>The Gemara in many places (eg <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=10b&format=pdf\">Chullin 10b</a>) says there is a principle of 'eid echad neeman bisurin' (one witness is to be believed regarding forbidden things). This is as opposed to the two witnesses generaly required in court. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\">Ramban</a> is his commentary there says that this reasoning is what allows one to eat food from his wife without a mashgiach because she is a single witness on the food and that is enough to be believed regarding forbidden foods.</p>\n\n<p>If one assumes that the other person is a 'good Jew' then they would thus be kosher as a witness and you can believe them about their food. Generally keeping keeping shabbat and other mitzvot are a good indication of this status.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I found this Rashi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=88&format=pdf\">Yevamot 88a</a>) which says my point very explicitly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר -- והא ודאי פשיטא לן דסמכי' עליה כל זמן שלא נחשד דאי לאו הכי אין לך אדם אוכל משל חברו ואין לך אדם סומך על בני ביתו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>The reason we require mashgiach and hechshers on products that you buy in the store or from a resteraunt, is because the person you are purchasing the food from gains a financial benefit from you purchasing. (obviously)  There is therefore a <a href=\"http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=292\">temptation to lie or to cut corners</a> in order to make a greater profit or to attract more customers.</p>\n\n<p>However, the opposite is true when going over to a person's private home. People do not gain financially when you eat at their homes. In fact, they lose financially.  So we assume there is no reason not to trust them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The question should be: What is the basis for needing a certificate from an organization before patronizing a food establishment?<br> If you think the food is kosher, eat it. If you're not sure, ask for proof. If you think it's not, don't eat there. But as @avi mentioned, there can be a monetary gain for a restaurant to claim it is kosher, so they might have an incentive to lie. Therefore you want proof that it's kosher, so we organized kashrut agencies to do the leg work for us. But to ask for proof from a host?! If you don't trust the guy, don't eat there. If you have a certain chumra you're not willing to break, let your host know and see if he holds the same way. But I definitely wouldn't pose the question as \"What is the basis for eating in someone's house without a kashrut certificate?\"</p>\n\n\n",

Akiba too [we learn that] Israel is free from planetary influence. For R. Akiba had a\n  daughter. Now, astrologers told him, On the day she enters the bridal chamber a snake will bite her\n  and she will die. He was very worried about this. On that day [of her marriage] she took a brooch\n  [and] stuck it into the wall and by chance it penetrated [sank] into the eye of a serpent. The following\n  morning, when she took it out, the snake came trailing after it. ‘What did you do?’ her father asked\n  her. ‘A poor man came to our door in the evening.’ she replied, ‘and everybody was busy at the\n  banquet, and there was none to attend to him. So I took the portion which was given to me and gave\n  it to him. ‘You have done a good deed,’ said he to her. Thereupon R. Akiba went out and lectured:\n  ‘But charity delivereth from death’: and not [merely] from an unnatural death, but from death itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Was Rabbi Akiva obligated to tell his daughter's potential suitor that an astrologer had foretold that she would die on the day of her marriage?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Preface: I don't think my answer actually happened, I just like the way the pieces fit together.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=63&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kesubot (63A)</a>, Ben Azzai was engaged to the daughter of R' Akiva.</p>\n\n<p>So, assuming the opinion in Masechet <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=2361&size=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sotah (4B)</a> that Ben Azzai married and later separated from his wife, since \"What could he do, his soul desired Torah, let the world continue through someone else (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=63b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yevamot 63B</a>), and assuming that the daughter he was engaged to was this same daughter of Rabbi Akiva who was destined to die:</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Ben Azzai didn't really want to get married, since his heart yearned for Torah. However, when R' Akiva told him that his daughter was going to die on her wedding night, Ben Azzai figured that this would be an easy way to do the mitzvah of marriage without having to stop solely devoting his life to Torah. Once Rabbi Akiva's daughter survived, Ben Azzai separated from her, since he didn't really want to be married in the first place, he just wanted to sit and learn Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First, let's establish that Rabbi Akiva's chidush at the end is not that Jews aren't affected by astrology.

The chidush at the end was that tzedaka can also save even from an abnormal death.</p>\n\n<p>So need R' Akiva tell the suitor about a danger that doesn't exist and won't definitely come to fruition?  I would compare this (although you can argue) with a family history of disease.  The person doesn't have it and won't necessarily get it, so it is unnecessary to tell.</p>\n\n\n",

After citing the various details about how much you're supposed to give to a poor person, he says that all of this applies only to those who יושבים בביתם ומסוה הבושה על פניהם - they sit at home with a veil of shame over their face (i.e., they're too embarrassed to go out and ask for tzedakah); by contrast, he says, there are no fixed rules regarding people who go around collecting door-to-door - everyone should just give them a little something (as in Will's answer).</p>\n\n<p>Now, that first category sounds to me like it's describing a person who is not working - and yet there is an obligation to give him tzedakah and to \"fill all of his needs\" (ibid. :1-2). Although I guess that's not really dispositive, because perhaps Aruch Hashulchan simply means that he \"sits at home\" after he's finished his day job (or, perhaps, is unable to find one).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I heard that R.H.S Schachter says there is no mitzvah to give such a person Tzedaka. While this may be obvious, perhaps support for this position can be brought from the case of helping a person with his animal's burden. The halacha is that one only needs to help if the owner also participates, but not if the owner says \"I'll stand aside and let you have the mitzvah\". So too here, you should only need to help him if he is at least trying to help himself. </p>\n\n<p>With regards to tzedakah specifically, it is obviously forbidden for a person to take tzedaka when he doesn't really need it. This applies to when he really has money, but I don't see why it shouldn't also apply to when he has the ability to earn money. \"Mai chazis\" that he's worth more than other people that they should work for him and give him money? </p>\n\n<p>As for  the title of the question, see the end of my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9467/is-the-market-based-distribution-of-income-fair-or-unfair\">\"Is the market-based distribution of income fair or unfair?\"</a> which discusses what is considered poor for different levels of tzedaka.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a whole chapter (251) in <em>Yore Dea</em> devoted to these details.

    "content": "# Praying for rain in the Diaspora\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why on this year (and on other years that precede civil leap years) do we start praying for rain in the Diaspora (by inserting the phrase 'Vetein tal umatar\") at maariv of December 5 and not maariv of December 4 like most years?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 40)\n\n<h2>Obligatory Summary</h2>\n\n<p>The Jewish day starts at night, but V'sein Tal Umatar is based on solar calendar, so it can sometimes be a day later. Plus the date was established in Julian Calendar, so there's also the Julian->Gregorian shift to keep us busy...</p>\n\n<h2>Real Answer</h2>\n\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=10&format=pdf\">Taanis 10a</a>) says that in Bavel we start saying V'sein Tal Umatar on the 60th day after Tekufas Tishrei - the autumnal equinox (<em>why</em> is beyond the scope of this question). This is followed in all of Chutz Laaretz (here too, <em>why</em> is beyond the scope of this question).</p>\n\n<p>[note: for purposes of this calculation we use the astronomically-imprecise Tekufa D'Shmuel to approximate the autumnal equinox]</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, we need to figure out when the \"autumnal equinox\" is, so we can add 60 days.</p>\n\n<p>Because the equinox follows the sun, we will need to look at the solar calendar. As you may know, the modern-day Gregorian Calendar was not always used. At one point in time, the Julian Calendar (with slightly different rules) was the norm. The Halacha to say V'sein Tal Umatar was established when the Julian Calendar was in use, so the date chosen was: <strong>November 21 or 22</strong> in the Julian Calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Why can it possibly fall out on two different days? Let's take a look at a sample 5 years to develop a simple pattern:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In 2008, Tekufas Tishrei is on October 7th at 3:00 am.</li>\n<li>In 2009, Tekufas Tishrei is on October 7th at 9:00 am.</li>\n<li>In 2010, Tekufas Tishrei is on October 7th at 3:00 pm.</li>\n<li>In 2011, Tekufas Tishrei is on October 7th at 9:00 pm.</li>\n<li>In 2012, Tekufas Tishrei is on October 7th at 3:00 am.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See it now? In each year after 2008, the Tekufah has a 6-hour drift. But the drift resets because we know every 4 years has a leap year (or at least that's how it was in the Julian Calendar).</p>\n\n<p>But... one of those years is a \"problem\". We know that the Jewish day starts out at night. So if the Tekufah falls out on October 7th at 9:00 <strong>pm</strong> [as it does in the 4th bullet] we will need to count it for the next day. So, as you can see we emerge with: <strong>in the year before a leap year, we knock the day forward 1</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today's times where we use the Gregorian Calendar. We need to translate that date into the Gregorian Calendar. To do so, we need to keep in mind all the subtleties of differences between the two. As time goes on the two calendars (ever so slightly) drift further and further apart [the first drift occurred immediately, when 10 days were \"erased\" from the calendar].</p>\n\n<h2>Putting it all together</h2>\n\n<p>This year (2011) is the year before a leap year. It also happens to be that we are running a 13 day difference between Julian and Gregorian. So take November 22, <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=November+22%2C+2011+%2B+13+days\">add 13 days</a>, and voila: December 5, 2011 emerges.</p>\n\n<h2>And going forward</h2>\n\n<p>The next time the Julian and Gregorian calendar fall out of step will be in 2100. We'll worry about it then...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"עם לבן גרתי\"? Really? \"עם לבן ברתי\" maybe\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi brings a <em>gematria</em> at the beginning of Parshas Vayishlach:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גרתי בגימטריא תרי\"ג, כלומר, עם לבן הרשע גרתי, ותרי\"ג מצות שמרתי, ולא למדתי ממעשיו הרעים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, if one takes this literally, it is attesting to the fact that Yaakov actually kept all the laws of the Torah. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4078/avot-keeping-mitzvot\">here</a>.) Let us assume this opinion. [According to others, though, I understand that it may be simply an allusion to the fact that Yaakov remained righteous even though he lived in Lavan's estate.]</p>\n\n<p>But, we know that Yaakov in fact did <strong><em>not</em></strong> keep all the <em>mitvos</em> of the Torah. He married two sisters. Now, although clearly <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4088/yaakov-marrying-two-sisters\">many reasons are given</a> to explain his ability to do so, he still cannot say \"תרי\"ג מצות שמרתי\" if one of the 613 was explicitly violated. How can he say that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Among the many explanations of what it means when we say that the Avos kept the Torah (as in the linked question) is that they did so on a spiritual level. R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi thus states in one of his Chassidic discourses (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/maamarei/572/28/index.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Va'eira 5572</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קיים אאע״ה כל התורה כולה עד שלא ניתנה וכן ביעקב עם לבן גרתי ותרי״ג מצות שמרתי והיינו רק ברוחנית שהרי לא יתכן שקימו מצות חליצה ויבום ופרה אדומה כו׳</p>\n<p>\"Our forefather Avraham kept the entire Torah before it was given, and so too with Yaakov, 'I sojourned with Lavan and kept the 613 mitzvos'. This is only on a spiritual level, since it is impossible for them to have carried out the mitzvos of chalitzah, yibbum, parah adumah, etc.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- and he goes on to explain that in this sense they reached only a \"lower\" level of closeness to Hashem, unlike us, their descendants, who are able to perform these mitzvos physically and thereby connect with Hashem's Essence.</p>\n<p>So according to this approach, the fact that Yaakov in fact married two sisters is neither here nor there: he accomplished that mitzvah in a spiritual dimension, just like all of the others.</p>\n<p>How so? The Tzemach Tzedek (in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/zz/dm/1/11/index.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvosecha, Issur Ervas Achos Ishto</a> 30a-b) explains that Yaakov's marriage to Rachel and Leah - and indeed, all of the forbidden relations in the Torah in general - in fact are reflective of the \"unification\" of enormously great Divine energies in the world of Atzilus, energies which are too intense to descend into the lower worlds - including our own - without being perverted into evil. He continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא שיעקב לפי שהי' לפני מ\"ת והי' טהור וקדוש עשה כן דוגמת היחוד באצי' כי לו יאתה לעשות כן להיותו מרכבה למדות דאצי' וגם לאה ורחל הם מרכבה כנ\"ל ועדיין לא ניתנה תורה בבי\"ע לאסור לעשות כן למטה</p>\n<p>\"But Yaakov - living as he did before the Giving of the Torah, and being pure and holy - did this following the model of the unification in Atzilus. It was appropriate for him to do so, since he was a 'chariot' for the attributes of Atzilus, and Leah and Rachel too were a similar 'chariot,' as explained earlier, and the Torah had not yet been given in the [lower worlds of] Beriah-Yetzirah-Asiyah to forbid this to be done below.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, then, that Yaakov lived and observed Torah as it is in Atzilus; what actually happened here on earth could not affect that higher spiritual world. That began only with the Giving of the Torah, when Hashem declared that \"the lower ones can ascend above, and the higher ones can descend below\" (Shemos Rabbah 12:3).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11997/603\">@rony</a> points out, there were many mitzvot that Yaakov had no way of keeping while he was in the house of Laban. Some examples include all the mitzvot that are dependent on the Land (e.g. Trumah) and Mitzvot that are dependent on the congregation (e.g. appointing a king). @Alex brings other examples in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12027/603\">his answer</a>. If so, how could Yaakov say \"עם לבן גרתי ותרי״ג מצות שמרתי\"</p>\n<p>According to the Chumash Shai LaMorah, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43052&pgnum=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darchei David offers</a> the following answer, based on a Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=110&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot (110A)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יצחק מאי דכתיב זאת תורת החטאת וזאת תורת האשם כל העוסק בתורת חטאת כאילו הקריב חטאת וכל העוסק בתורת אשם כאילו הקריב אשם</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchok said: What does it teach us when it says \"This is the Torah of a sin-offering\", \"And this is the Torah of a guilt-offering\"? All who toil in the laws of a sin-offering are considered as if offered a sin-offering, and all who toil in the laws of a guilt-offering are considered as if offered a guilt-offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Darchei David extends this logic and says that Yaakov was telling Eisav that he toiled in the Torah of all 613 Mitzvot, and it was therefore as if he performed all the commandments.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Ya'akov couldn't be \"mekayem\" (to perform?) all the miztvot. For example Kivud av (honoring your parents) and Yishuv Eretz Yisrael (live in Israel). So here \"shamarti\" may mean something different. When Ya'akov heard Yosef's dream (Breshit 37:11) the Torah writes that he \"shamar\" the dream. Rashi writes: שמר את הדבר - היה ממתין ומצפה מתי יבא, he waited anxiously for it to happen. So maybe here too, Ya'akov is telling Esav that not only he kept all what he had to and could do but even waited until he could keep all the rest and didn't give up his hope.</p>\n\n<p>BTW regarding the 2 sisters he married there is a long discussion in Chazal on the matter.</p>\n\n\n",

Jewish mysticism has its origins in Greek mysticism, a system of belief which included reincarnation. Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, some of the hymns found are similar to the  Hekhaloth hymns of the Jewish mystics. One text of hymns gives us clear evidence of Jewish mysticism. The text is called \"Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice.\" Fragments of  1 Enoch, which is considered the oldest text of Jewish mysticism, were also found with the Scrolls. Since evidence shows Jewish mysticism existed in the third century B.C.E., as Enoch indicates, then it would certainly have existed in first-century Israel. </p>\n\n<p>Quote from: <a href=\"http://www.near-death.com/experiences/judaism06.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Afterlife Beliefs</a></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The books you are looking for are called \"Merkavah\" and \"Heichalot\" literature.

What does somebody who can stand but only with the aid of a cane, walker, or crutches do?  I have heard (no source) that somebody who <em>can't</em> stand at all prays while sitting; does the person who can't stand unaided sit, or stand and lean?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The most famous leaning in Judaism that I can think of is during the Passover Seder.  There we lean to show that we are wealthy and like kings.  Wouldn't it be that when Davening shmone Esre we are humbling ourselves before Hashem and therefore don't want to appear as wealthy or like kings?  Following this logic, people who must have something to lean on would not be held to this same standard as they are not appearing as kings and are still humble in the eyes of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If sleeping suffices for \"ad d'lo yada\", why drink?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&pgnum=323\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>OC</em> 695:2)</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One must become drunk on <em>Purim</em> until he doesn't know the difference between \"<em>arur Haman</em>\" and \"<em>baruch Mord'chay</em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>Rama</em> (ad loc.) adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But some say that he need not get so drunk: rather, he should drink more than his custom and sleep; because he's sleeping, he doesn't know the difference between \"<em>arur Haman</em>\" and \"<em>baruch Mord'chay</em>\".</p>\n  \n  <p>One who does much or little — so long as he directs his heart to heaven!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the <em>Rama</em>'s words \"and sleep; because he's sleeping, etc.\", <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&pgnum=323\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em></a> comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That's what's seemly to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(All translations are my own.) If one follows this ruling, that sleep is a way — the appropriate way! — to fulfill the \"not know the difference\" rule, why does one need to drink at all? Is it simply to increase the likelihood he'll fall asleep? If so, can a tired person just lie down without drinking?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to clarify my question, since I am dissatisfied with the answers thus far given:</p>\n\n<p>There is certainly an idea of drinking wine on <em>Purim</em> to commemorate the miracles that took place through the medium of drinking wine. There is, on the other hand, an idea of <em>la yada</em>, of not knowing the difference between \"<em>arur Haman</em>\" and \"<em>baruch Mord'chay</em>\". The <em>Rama</em> explicitly severs the strong connection between these implied by the <em>g'mara</em>'s statement \"must get drunk on <em>Purim</em> until he doesn't know...\": the <em>Rama</em> says that one need not get so drunk as to satisfy \"<em>la yada</em>\"! (This seems to directly contradict the <em>g'mara</em>.) It is sufficient, he writes, to drink a bit and fall asleep and, by sleeping, satisfy \"<em>la yada</em>\". There's thus a domino effect, according to the <em>Rama</em>: one drinks sufficiently to sleep, and sleeps sufficiently to \"<em>la yada</em>\". Yet <em>drunkenness</em> (which is what the <em>g'mara</em> speaks of) needn't lead to \"<em>la yada</em>\": in fact, one needn't get drunk at all! So the <em>g'mara</em>'s requirement \"to get drunk until he doesn't know...\" is <strong>gone</strong>. <em>Rama</em> doesn't hold of it. Why, then, does he require drinking to lead to sleep? If the \"to get drunk until he doesn't know...\" is gone, why isn't it sufficient to simply \"doesn't know\" (e.g., by sleeping without drinking) (and drink as a separate thing, perhaps after sleeping, to commemorate the miracles)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Maybe the reason to fall asleep specifically through the process of drinking wine is to remember the miracle which was done through wine at the different wine parties in the Book of Esther as outlined here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/6393/759\">Can you use Liquor to fulfill Ad Dlo Yoda?</a></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I challenge your assumption that the two rules are separated. The Rambam writes in Megillah 2:15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>`כיצד חובת סעודה זו--שיאכל בשר ויתקן סעודה נאה, כפי אשר תמצא ידו; ושותה יין, עד שישתכר ויירדם בשכרות.<br>\n  What is the nature of the obligation of this meal? One should eat meat and fix up a nice meal, as much as his means allow. And he should drink wine until he gets drunk and falls asleep in his drunkardness. (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam clearly connects the two rules. Note that the Rambam does not mention the classic rule of differentiating between Haman and Mordechai. Likely he holds a similar line of reasoning as the Rama (that the way one is <em>supposed</em> to accomplish Lo Yada is through a drunken sleep) or else he views that rule as aggadic in nature. Either way, we see that the two rules are not split. Why would that be? See my answer above and comments below.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'll go you one better - if the purpose is to not know the difference between <em>\"arur Haman\"</em> and *\"baruch Mordechai\", why bother drinking <em>or</em> sleeping at all?   </p>\n\n<p>Of course, I'm not referring to the highly intelligent community that patronizes this site, but do you really think that most of the rest of us really know the difference while we're sober?  </p>\n\n<p>This is a very subtle difference - it's not about getting confused between \"which is the good guy and which is the bad guy\", it's about realizing that Haman being cursed is not equivalent to Mordechai being blessed, and sometimes it's hard to tell which is which. </p>\n\n<p>Or, in a more general phraseology, the downfall of your enemy is not sufficient for your own success. </p>\n\n<p>I think it really comes back to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Al tismach b'nfol oyvecha</em> (and the continuation...)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does the average Jew really know the difference, and remember this throughout his daily life, even without getting drunk / sleeping? (Or am I just being too cynical again?)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Mitzvah isn't to pass out or even to space out. The Mitzvah is one of Simhah. The Gemara, in my opinion, is simply saying that the revelry ought to be great. Asked to quantify it, it just went for the most extreme. I think it is, essentially, a license to get totally hammered. Not as a Mitzvah in and of itself, but rather as a function, or a measure, of how celebratory one's party atmosphere should be. We get dragged into so much ritual on other holidays, and here, I think, the Gemara is just saying to let it all hang loose. I would equate it to the dancing at a wedding. I always tell people, \"You haven't been to a fun wedding until you've been to an Orthodox Jewish wedding.\" I explain that we are so conservative the rest of the time, that this is our rare opportunity to just let loose, so we go all out. Similarly, I think, the Gemara wants us to go all out and have a good time on Purim. </p>\n\n<p>I do not think, however, that this contradicts the attempts, going back centuries now, to get people to dial it back a little (or even a lot). Some of the same people who might make Frum weddings awesome make Purim an embarrassment. People seem to know how to really rock a wedding hall without puking on the bride (and, yes, they do get drunk at weddings). Yet, for some reason, on Purim, they drink to the point that not only can't they tell between Baruch Mordechai and Arur Haman, but they can't tell between the toilet bowl and the Rebbitzen's lap, and they drink not to the point of confusion, but well beyond that to the point of illness and even alcohol poisoning. That, I think, is where Gedolim throughout the ages have been trying to set limits, and if only people celebrating knew how to properly direct their Simhah, then oddly Halahic-sounding, letter-of-the-law type of solutions, like taking a nap, which are themselves analyzed to a ridiculous degree, would be unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not trying to negate sleeping as a solution, and I have employed it myself on occasion.  But I'm trying to refocus the discussion where I think it needs to be. Forgive me if I sound a bit presumptuous. </p>\n\n\n",

I asked him if he intended to drink Rov Kos (a majority of the cup), a stringent approach in line with the fullness of his cup, and he specifically said he was Meikel on that and specifically only drank Rov Lugmo.

I believe Rav Scheinberg.  Note that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef shlit'a considers some Sephardic opinions (Rashba I think?) that kiddush material must be either alcoholic, or a substance that can be made alcoholic (e.g. grape juice, even if this particular grape juice has been pasturized or contains preservatives).  I would think, according to this reasoning, that apple juice would still be okay, as apple juice can be made into applejack. </li>\n<li>Orange juice, coffee, tea, milk (at least for Ashkenazim).</li>\n<li>Soda is debatable. If I recall someone asked R' Moshe Feinstein, who said no. \"But they serve it at all the fancy weddings!\"  Still no.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hard liquor is certainly respectable enough of a beverage; the question is its quantity. If I recall correctly, the original source on this is a Taz (see msh210's answer) in the laws of Brachos, who says if you drink whatever is considered a significant amount of a special beverage, that can warrant an after-bracha, even if it was less than the standard 3.3 fluid ounces. Later authorities have suggested this could be applied to kiddush as well; if a shot of whiskey is considered  significant, that may count. Again, ask your local rabbi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><em>Note: This answer was penned when the question was only \"What is the minimum Shi'ur (volume) of a cup required for making Kiddush on liquor?

However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40312&pgnum=36\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Eshel Avraham</em> (Buczacz, 272)</a> writes (in my own loose translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One can excuse those who make [daytime] <em>kidush</em> on whiskey in a small cup.... This is because, once the <em>Taz</em> writes that one says a <em>b'racha acharona</em> after even a small amount of whiskey (since it's so strong), perhaps the same applies here regarding <em>kidush</em> by day.... However, it's best to make <em>kidush</em> on a <em>r'viis</em>, as the <em>Tz'lach</em> says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=103\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em> 272:30</a> demands a <em>r'viis</em> and <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> (as far as I see) doesn't discuss the issue, use of a smaller cup is somewhat widespread and supported by rabbis, especially, I think, among <em>chasidim</em>: see, e.g., <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&pgnum=181\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Taame Haminhagim</em>, footnote 75 to paragraph 365</a>.

On Sabbaths, festivals, and Rosh Hodesh, the word magdil is changed to migdol. Various explanations for this have been given (O.H. 189 in M.A. 1). The verse in question comes from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2618.htm#51\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psalm 18:51</a>, where magdil is used. However, in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b22.htm#51\" rel=\"nofollow\">2 Samuel 22:51</a>, where Psalm 18 is repeated, the word migdol is read, It has been suggested that the original text of the Grace had magdil, but that someone added the parenthetical phrase v-b-s-\"b m-g-d-v-l indicating that the reading is migdol in 2 Samuel. This was later misread as an abbreviation for u'vshabat, and it was assumed that we are to say migdol on the Sabbath. Whatever the reason, this has become the established custom, and as usual in such cases, it is easier to reinterpret than to abolish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it okay to enjoy Christmas lights?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My daughter is always talking about how she hates everything Christmas, including the lights on the houses.  I am trying to encourage her that she can like non religious things like the lights, so that she can comfortably live in America.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything wrong with enjoying Christmas lights?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Based on my research (see below), Christmas lights are <strong>entirely secular,</strong> and therefore there is <strong>no</strong> problem whatsoever with looking at or enjoying Christmas lights.</p>\n<p>Even if the lights are not entirely secular, there still wouldn't be a problem.  The <strong>Shach</strong> (Shulchan Aruch 142:15), based on <strong>Tosfos</strong> and the <strong>Rosh</strong>, writes that it is <strong>permitted</strong> to derive benefit from decorations that are not directly used in idolatrous practices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jemsem.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=89&Itemid=54\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rabbi Aharon Tendler</strong></a> directly addresses this issue, and rules that one <strong>may</strong> look at and enjoy Christmas lights, but he doesn't think it's appropriate to do so. His reasoning is as follows (quoted in full; emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only prohibition to look at Christmas lights might be is they are used for Avodah Zara, and that you are actually benefiting from them by looking at them. Even if we assume that Christianity is Avodah Zara, the lights are not part of their worship, to the best of my knowledge. Also, most lights that are in urban areas, such as in malls and department stores are not part of a religious service at all, but rather used as a way to attract buyers to come shop. Additionally, merely looking at them would not be considered a Hana'ah (benefit). Consequently, there is <strong>no Issur to look at Christmas lights</strong> if you happen to be passing by them. I don't think that it would be appropriate to specifically stop for the purpose of admiring them, but I'd be hard pressed to find a basis upon which to rule that even that would be forbidden according to Halacha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Based on my research, the modern practice of decorating the outside of the house with Christmas lights is entirely secular, and in fact can be traced back to a <em>marketing stunt</em> by Thomas Edison's Edison Electric Light Company!  (Sources: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_lights\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/christmaslights.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Library of Congress</a>, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5425395/christmas-lights-the-brief-and-strangely-interesting-history-of\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gizmodo</a>, <a href=\"http://mymerrychristmas.com/2005/lights.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The History of Christmas Lights</a>)</p>\n<p>The secular nature of the lights continues to this day.  As a <a href=\"http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/sites/default/files/christmaslights.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">professor at Yale</a> states,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"One of the key aspects of  the American Christmas light display is its secular\nnature.  Although some people do utilize lighting for religious exaltation — for example\nwith illuminated outdoor nativity scenes[1] — the vast majority do not directly associate light displays with religion.  Christmas lights have maintained many of their original nonreligious meanings...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>([1] Note how he only says that some people use lights to <em>depict</em> religious scenes.  The lights themselves are not religious in nature.)</p>\n<p>The practice of placing lights on the Christmas tree is older, and while the tree has Christian symbolism, the lights themselves do <em>not.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first decorated tree was at Riga in Latvia, in 1510. In the early 16th century, Martin Luther is said to have decorated a small Christmas Tree with candles, to show his children how the stars twinkled through the dark night. (<a href=\"http://www.christmasarchives.com/trees.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n<p>The use of special lights on Christmas originally started with putting small candles on Christmas Trees in the home. Christmas Tree traditions go back to a Germany in the 1500s, and it’s believed the idea to put lights on the trees was started by Martin Luther, a famous priest who was inspired by the prettiness of stars twinkling between evergreens while walking home one night. (<a href=\"http://whyzz.com/why-do-we-put-up-christmas-lights\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the general practice of lighting lights in the dead of winter can be connected to pagan Winter Solstice rituals, by this point in time any such association has been completely overwhelmed by the increasingly secular nature of the holiday.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>However, in my humble opinion, a Jew should <em>not</em> decorate his own house with such lights at Christmas time, due to issues of \"Mar'os Ayin\" and \"Imitating Gentile Customs.\"</p>\n<p>As an interesting sidenote, there is a not-too-uncommon practice in Israel to decorate the Sukkah with strings of lights - identical to the strings Americans would call \"Christmas lights.\"  I don't know what conclusions can or should be gleaned from this observation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It is permissible to enjoy Christmas lights. (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14054&st=&pgnum=430&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ben Ish Hai S\"B Mase 2</a> who says that they don't have the din of idol worship, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9146&st=&pgnum=135&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulhan Aruch Yoreh Deah 142:15 with Shach</a>).

And all their wealth and all of their children and their women, they captured and plundered, and everything that was in the house.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My eight-year-old son, when he learned these pesukim recently, asked me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why are three different verbs used (\"took,\" \"captured,\" \"plundered\")? Granted that \"captured\" is appropriate for the people (\"children and women\"), but then what's the difference between the other two? (I suggested that perhaps \"their wealth\" at the beginning of the verse means inanimate possessions - money, jewelry, etc. - and then \"plundered\" would apply to those, as compared to animals which you'd \"take\" by making them follow you by voice or with a stick, and people whom you'd \"capture\" by shackling them. But I'm not sure of that.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What does \"and everything that was in the house\" add? Whatever was in the house should logically be included in \"whatever was in the city\" of the previous verse.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is that clause added almost as an afterthought? We would expect the verse to be structured something like this: \"And their wealth, their children and their women, and everything that was in the house, they captured and plundered.\"</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your suggestion is correct. \"Took\" refers to the animals, \"captured\" refers to the women and children, and \"plundered\" refers to the wealth and objects from their houses. See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40102&st=&pgnum=324\">Malbim</a>.</li>\n<li>Technically, everything was \"in the city\". I would suggest that the phrase \"וְאֵת אֲשֶׁר בָּעִיר וְאֶת אֲשֶׁר בַּשָּׂדֶה\" refers to the animals mentioned immediately before. That is, they took all the sheep, cattle and donkeys, which were all the animals in the city (probably like the donkeys and other domesticated animals) and the fields (like the grazing sheep and cattle). Or you could read, \"they took all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, <em>as well as</em> the individual animals left in the city and the fields.\" (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14024&st=&pgnum=269\">Netziv</a>.)</li>\n<li>Perhaps the last phrase of the verse, \"וְאֵת כָּל-אֲשֶׁר בַּבָּיִת\", is not meant to be an afterthought, but rather putting a more specific emphasis on that phrase, separating it out from the rest. Notice that \"בַּבָּיִת\" is in the singular, which prompts <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&mefaresh=ezra&perek=34\">Ibn Ezra</a> to comment that this refers specifically to the house of Chamor or Sh'chem. All the rest of these verses are attacks on the city as a whole, but this particular phrase is referring to an attack specifically on the leader. Perhaps for this it is singled out.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

This comes into play when kids learn about God, who figures in all of the Parsha stories, deserves thanks for all of our food, etc., but can't be directly apprehended.</p>\n\n<p>In most other situations, we have words we teach kids to use for entities they hear about in stories that can't be seen or touched, such as \"imaginary\" or \"pretend.\"</p>\n\n<p>As a result, more than once, when God has come up in conversation, my 4-year-old has offhandedly pointed out that \"God's not real,\" or \"not a real person.\"</p>\n\n<p>How does one explain to a small child the distinction between God and (lehavdil) imaginary things in stories?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>\" my 4-year-old has offhandedly pointed out that \"God's not real,\" or \"not a real person.\"\"</p>\n\n<p>In response to this exact line of conversation I would suggest the following.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Admit to the child that based on how they understand \"real\", or how you have taught \"real\" to them in the past, they are correct.  </li>\n<li>Explain to the child that some things are real even if we can't touch them or see them. Like Germs, or the other planets, or feelings.</li>\n<li>Explain that Gd is very complicated, and is not actually a person, but you can have feelings, a relationship, and talk to him just the same.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Fortunately with my oldest child this has not been an issue, she innately believes in Hashem, and I have learned a lot from her! (A day after we learned we were expecting another child she told her teacher \"mommy has a baby in her belly\".  There is no way she could have know this.  The teacher checked it out with me as 3 year olds often tell stories and when we asked her why she thought mommy had a baby in her belly she responded \"Hashem told me\")</p>\n\n<p>I find with my other children, stressing the Hashem is everywhere instead of stressing that you can't see Hashem works well. The song \"Hashem is here, Hashem is there, Hashem is truly everywhere...\" helps a lot with this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Obviously depends on the child, especially their age, but also their personality. One of my daughters used to make similar statements, \"I don't like Hashem\" \"Why?\" \"Cause, where is He?\", when she was about four years old, but her twin sister never did. (I actually praised her for the question, calling her my \"little philosopher.\")</p>\n\n<p>The problem usually is simply that they have difficulty understanding the reality of something that they cannot see or feel. To this I would just point out that there are lots of things that we can't see or feel that are still very real (examples can range from air to radio waves).</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, the best response is usually just to shmooze about it with your kids and to make awareness of God something that is a real part of daily life in the home. Over time, kids will simply pick it up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Yosef tell over the dreams?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In this weeks Parsha (Vayeishev), we learn about how Yosef had his two [prophetic] dreams. We find that in each case, Yosef told his brothers about his dreams:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he said to them, \"Listen now to this dream, which I have dreamed:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading_cdo/aid/15555#v6\">37:6</a>) and again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he again dreamed another dream, and he related it to his brothers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading_cdo/aid/15555#v9\">37:9</a>)</p>\n\n<p>My question is, why did Yosef tell over the dreams to his brothers? What did he foresee it as accomplishing? If anything it only made them even more jealous!</p>\n\n<p>(especially after the first repetition's results - \"And they continued further to hate him on account of his dreams and on account of his words\" - became known)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l has a different take on it. In his talk of Shabbos Parshas Vayeishev 5734 (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4609&pgnum=221\">Sichos Kodesh 5734 1:201</a>-202), he explains that Yosef told over these dreams precisely because he hoped to use them to defuse his brothers' jealousy toward him.</p>\n\n<p>Previous dreams recorded in the Torah were basically meant to be taken at face value. For example, Yaakov's dream of the angels going up and down the ladder (Gen. 28:12) meant (among other things) just that: as Rashi says there, the angels who had accompanied him in Eretz Yisrael were returning Above, and a new cohort of angels was coming down. Later, too, when Yaakov dreamt about the sheep mating (ibid. 31:12), it presaged how he would breed his flocks and get more of the types of animals to which he was entitled based on his deal with Lavan.</p>\n\n<p>So here: Yosef knew full well that his brothers are jealous of the preferential treatment he's getting, and indeed that \"they couldn't speak peaceably to him\" (ibid. 37:4). So when he dreamt about their sheaves bowing to his, he immediately told it to them, hoping that they'd take it in its most literal sense: the next time they'd harvest their crops, his would be of better quality and would fetch a higher price. \"If my advantage over you is nothing more than such a trifle,\" he was implying, \"then you have nothing to be jealous about.\" However, this plan backfired: in their prejudice against him they assumed that there's more here than meets the eye, and that such a dream really means that Yosef thinks he will rule over them.</p>\n\n<p>So he tried again with his next dream. In it the stars bow to him, which might be understood to mean that the celestial bodies associated with their welfare (their mazalos) will be doing so, but not the brothers themselves. It might even be taken to mean that he, Yosef, is the only one without a good mazal of his own, and he needs theirs to assist him (\"bow to him\" in service) - which would mean that, on the contrary, they've got an advantage over him. When this time they ignored him, Yosef repeated the dream to Yaakov, hoping that <strong>he</strong> at least, free of such prejudices, would come up with the above seemingly correct explanation; but Yaakov too understood it in a non-literal sense like the brothers had done with the previous one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Rosh on the Torah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_on_Torah,_Genesis_37.5.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 37:5</a>) says that the dreams were a prophecy. And a prophet is obligated to tell over his prophecy. If not, he is liable to die by the hands of Heaven (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=1&perek=9&halocha=3&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 9:3</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Kluger explains that the gemara in Berachos teaches that the joy which is experienced as a result of having a good dream can suffice to act as its fulfilment, so that it will no longer actually come to pass. This is why Yosef related the dream to his brothers even though he knew that they would hate him for it, because if he did not tell them his joy would cause the dream not to come to pass. But by telling them the dream it would cause him distress, and so it would certainly come true.</p>\n\n<p>The full text can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Kluger-Books/Imrei-Shefer/Vayeishev.html#5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

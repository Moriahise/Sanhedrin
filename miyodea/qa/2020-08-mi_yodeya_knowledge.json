I know the Talmud is full of unlikely scenarios described to illustrate the law. But this one is beyond unlikely.

In one box he placed 13 pieces of paper, each containing one of the Hebrew months of the year (the miracle of Purim took place in a leap year, see Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 1:5, P’nei Moshe). In the other box he put 385 pieces of paper, each containing a number from 1 to 385, for all the days of the year. Haman thought as follows: If, for instance he pulled the month of Sivan (the third month) from the first box and the number 200 from the second box, then something would be wrong, since the 200th day of the year cannot occur in the third month.</p>\n<p>Haman was pleased when he pulled Adar Sheini (the thirteenth month) from the first box, and the number 368 from the second, because this came out to be the 13th day of Adar Sheini, and obviously the two lots supported each other.

Wholly righteous people are immediately written and sealed for life; wholly wicked people are immediately written and sealed for death; and middling people are left with their judgment suspended from Rosh HaShana until Yom Kippur, (their fate remaining undecided).

This is Halachic \"Safek\" (doubt) #2.</p>\n\n<p>Since before opening the box, the cat may be considered possibly dead, and now opening the box merely causes potential taking of life... then the whole act of opening the box is merely a S'fek S'fekah and is permitted on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Is the cat awake or asleep? </p>\n\n<p>If he is awake, the odds are even that he will be alive or dead upon observation and the matter is entirely in the hands of Heaven. </p>\n\n<p>But if he is asleep, we must remember that the Talmud says that sleep is 1/60 of death, so upon observation there is a 31/60 chance he will be dead, and only a 29/60 chance he will be alive.

Thus, Hashem knows what state the cat is in and will have already written it into the correct book.

However, if he does lie, then the growth of his nose may be attributed to the fact that his initial statement (now being a lie) made before Shabbos is what triggered the growth of his nose (and not the lie he actually uttered on Shabbos). So his performance of the melachos of Zoreah and Boneh was done while it was still the weekday, and therefore he is exempt from having desecrated Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>Although, the lie he uttered on Shabbos has the power to cause the growth all by itself, the previous statement made erev Shabbos is certainly a full cause as well, and therefore it becomes the classic case of \"Zeh v' Zeh Gorem\", and Pinocchio cannot be held liable.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>Since Pinocchio is a puppet; then he has the \"Din\" of an \"eved\" (slave) since by definition a puppet (even one with sentience and choice) is still a kind of slave.</p>\n<p>Slaves (according to the Gemara) are compared Halachically to Karka (land). Therefore the severed nose of Pinnochio has the \"Din\" of \"gedulei karka\" and is Kosher for \"schach\" as a Sukkah roof.</p>\n<p>However, if Pinnochio becomes a real boy, then the Sukkah is Pasul (as the nose no longer has the status of \"gedulei karka\" since Pinnochio is now both human and free. This transformation is \"chal Lemafreyah\" retroactively, so the nose was never \"gedulei karka\" in the first place.)</p>\n<h1>3</h1>\n<p>Since Pinnochio has some life even in puppet form, then the attached nose is not a \"kli\", but is \"batel\" to the living body of Pinnochio. Once it is severed, it still has no \"bais kibel\" as Pinnochio has no nostrils. So at worst, his nose falls under \"peshutei kli eytz\" or \"smooth wooden objects\" which are not mekabel tuma'ah.</p>\n<p>Still, some Poskim say that if the lies which fueled this nose were \"simple\" lies, then the nose is called \"pashut kli eytz\". But complicated lies ruin that \"pashut\" status (and then the nose is mekabel tuma'ah.)</p>\n<p>Still other Poskim say that all lies are complicated and therefore the nose is always mekabel tuma'ah anyway and therefore many avoid using a mat of Pinnochio noses as \"schach\".</p>\n<h1>4</h1>\n<p>Pinnochio's growth of nose has the same \"din\" as Tzaraas for Pinnochio and therefore there is an Issur (prohibition) to remove it.</p>\n<p>This is learned out because the Metzorah needs to cover himself up to his lip and call out \"Tamei\" wherever he goes. This covering up to his lip (moustache area) obviously points to the nose.</p>\n<p>Levit. 12:45: \"...he shall cover himself down to his mustache and call out, \"Unclean! Unclean!\"</p>\n<h1>5</h1>\n<p>From Genesis 2:7,  we see that even when a man is created from the inanimate ground, its nose is still imbued with life. Therefore, Pinnochio's nose could never be an Av HaTumah.</p>\n<p>\"And Hashem Elokim formed man of dust from the ground, and He breathed into his nostrils the soul of life, and man became a living soul.\"</p>\n<h1>6</h1>\n<p>Pinochio's nose is in fact suitable for use in the Mishkan. We learn this out because even though lying is a sin, still there is Biblical example where sinful offerings from pretenders must be used in the Mishkan to set a rememberance and example.</p>\n<p>In Bamidbar 17 - 18, … 250 false Kohanim Gedolim (of Korach's rebellion) tried to offer incense and were consumed by fire before Hashem for their falsehood. Yet, their firepans which were made for incense offerings (associated with the NOSE!) were made part of the Mizbeach.</p>\n<h1>7</h1>\n<p>אֱמֶת מֵאֶ֣רֶץ תִּצְמָ֑ח</p>\n<p>Tehillim 85: 12-13: \"<strong>Truth will sprout</strong> from the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven. Hashem too will give good, <strong>and our land will give its produce.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>From here we learn a \"Drasha\", that we are only \"noheg\" the laws of orlah and shmittah regarding truthful growth of produce. This excludes Pinnochio's nose which was sprouted from lies.</p>\n<h1>8</h1>\n<p>By the Flood it says: Gen. 6:11 \"Now the earth was corrupt before Hashem, and the earth became full of robbery.\"</p>\n<p>Corruption and dishonest gain are related to the concept of lies.</p>\n<p>Gen. 7:22 \"Everything that had the breath of the spirit of <strong>life in its nostrils</strong>, of all that were on the dry land, died.\"</p>\n<p>So the flood punished through the taking of life which is in the nose.</p>\n<p>so we see that only dishonesty is punished through the nose. However, other sins like Lashon Hara etc. that the OP listed, would be punished in other ways.</p>\n<p>However,</p>\n<p>Genesis 27:27 \"And he came closer, and he kissed him, and he smelled the fragrance of his garments, and he blessed him, and he said, \"Behold, the fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of a field, which the Lord has blessed!\"</p>\n<p>When Yaakov pretends to be Esav, he is doing so in essence for Shalom Bayis (his mother told him to do so because the Brachos of Klal Yisroel should not be destroyed etc.)</p>\n<p>So we see that pretending for Shalom, is rewarded with the smell of Gan Eden which is associated with the nose.</p>\n<p>So the nose will not grow due to Shalom Bayis!</p>\n<p>And that verse is 27 of 27.</p>\n<p>2+7 = 9 and 2+7 = 9</p>\n<p>Emes (truth) = 441, and 4+4+1 = 9 !</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Crackers - Why wouldn't that require an Hamotzi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As we know there are 3 different guidelines that would make a baked good a 'Pas Habah B'kisnin'. The third guideline is: if the bread is hard and dry, for example, pretzels.</p>\n<p>With this Shit\"a, the companies have produced all sorts of crackers which for decades we make on them a Mezonos, assuming that this falls into the category of hard and dry.</p>\n<p>Now, years ago (not too many), people were not so scared of washing and bentching, and the main form of a meal was to wash for bread. Being so, it made a lot of sense that crackers should be Mezonos since the primary form of eating crackers would be for a snack only. However today things have changes and more people have gotten the Bentchaphobia (a medical term describing fear of bentching...), so crackers has become at least as common of a meal than bread. How many of us actually wash at work for lunch? we rather eat a whole bunch of whole wheat crackers with tuna or cheese.</p>\n<p>I don't think that a <strong>meal</strong> can be considered, only if eating a 5 course meal. Anything that you eat B'kvius, to satisfy yourself, should be considered a meal.</p>\n<p>We see that the Ashkenazim recite Hamotzi on Matzah all year round, and the simple reason is because we eat it in place of bread. Now, if we eat the same Matzah just in bite size portions then the Bracha changes?! And if so, then why if I made bite size bread, no one would even think of making a Mezonos?</p>\n<p>The way I understood this Shit\"a in Shulchan Aruch is, that the fact that it's so hard and crispy makes it inappropriate for a meal, but rather eaten as a snack. this is really the underlying reason for all other Shit\"as for Pas Habah Bkusnin, the fact that no one will smear tuna onto a chocolate danish is a great explanation to the reasoning behind Pas Habah Bkisnin (chocolate danishes are Mezonos due to their sweet ingredients, or the chocolate filling baked together with them), I think this should be the guideline for the other Shit\"as as well.</p>\n<p>When answering this question please have in mind that the question is asked with today's lifestyle specifically in mind.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Pas haba bkisnin becomes hamotzi when you eat 8 k'zeisim of it, and if the crackers are eaten with tuna, the tuna counts toward the shiur (Igros Moshe OC 3:32). But I presume your question is whether crackers today are elevated to the status of bread since most people eat them for a meal (similar to pizza according to many, and \"mezonos bread\" and full-sized matza too), such that even a small amount requires hamotzi. In the case of flavored or spiced crackers like tam-tams I think it's clearly a snack food, but the question is about flour-and-water-only crackers. Even if you will argue that our office meals are not really meals since we don't stop working while eating, still one could argue that these crackers are the same as matza, only smaller.</p>\n<p>In fact, I heard a story about the Debreciner Rav who gave the hashgacha on such a cracker company, and printed ברכתו מזונות on the package. Someone asked him why, and he replied that he personally followed the minhag of the Satmar Rav and the Sefardim to make mezonos on matza all year, so therefore the small crackers are also mezonos. But those who make hamotzi on matza should make hamotzi on the crackers too. I think his point was that size is not a factor in determining whether people usually eat something for a meal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>kvias seuda</em> is not well defined. As you say it does not need to be a 5-course meal, but it also should not include snacking instead of a meal. I understand <em>kvias seuda</em> to generally be sitting together with others for eating, or at least sitting properly for eating in a manner which would be fitting for a group meal. For <em>pas haba bkisnin</em> you would need to be eating an amount that most people would prefer to sit down and eat it as a dedicated activity. If you are having a snack while working in place of a meal, I don't think that can ever qualify as <em>kvias seuda</em>, even if it is quite common.</p>\n\n<p>As Ashkenazim, we generally only eat matza at meals, on Pesach, so if we eat Matza during the year, we consider it a meal-food, and not a snack. Pretzels and crackers are generally eaten as snacks, so that makes them different than Matza in this regard. </p>\n\n\n",

Halacha at its core is a theoretical framework which we apply practically, so we should be fine with purely theoretical discussion, as long as it fits with the natural framework that we live in. We would not accept theoretical questions about Martians for example (can they convert to Judaism?), because that has no meaning in our reality, so it has no place in Halachic discussion.

There are two types of \"foreigners\" mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n<p>One is called a זר, loosely translated as \"stranger\" or outsider. These people are absolutely forbidden to even approach any Israelite as it says in Bemidbar 18:4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְזָ֖ר לֹא־יִקְרַ֥ב אֲלֵיכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>A stranger shall not come near to you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second type of foreigner is called a גר.

Now Nissan would not occur until next month!)</p>\n\n<p>The Sages held that one may not in fact buy a Nissan car during Adar! So Hezekiah would not be allowed to reverse the day to Adar after he purchased the new Nissan!</p>\n\n<p>Hezekiah held on the other hand, that one may in fact buy a new Nissan car during Adar and had no problem reversing the day from a potential Rosh Chodesh Nissan back to Adar!</p>\n\n<p>The Sages held, that since cars were given in this world mainly for the evildoers, (as it is written Numbers 23:4: \"וַיִּקָּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־בִּלְעָ֑ם \"VaYakar Elokim el Billam..\" \"and Hashem gave a car to Billam.\") </p>\n\n<p>therefore, one must only buy a new car during the month of Nissan when it is a time of redemption and rejoicing, and when Moshiach is destined to come etc. </p>\n\n<p>and Hezekiah?

The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.61a.6?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 61a</a>) presents two opinions: one is that Eve was created as a fully-formed human, with she and Adam attached back-to-back, and then G-d separated them; the other is that Adam had a \"zanav\" (lit., \"tail,\" although some of the commentaries explain that this just means any extra body part*). According to either of those, there was flesh involved too.</p>\n\n<p>(The Midrash, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.18.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 18:2</a>, does say that it was a rib, but then that doesn't necessarily have to mean just the bone - it might well have included intercostal muscle too. Come to think of it, the ribs contain marrow, and that has the status of \"flesh\" in halachah as well.)</p>\n\n<p>In a (since deleted) comment, the OP mentioned an idea that the bone in question was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">baculum</a>, and that the Torah is offering an explanation of its absence in human males. That seems unlikely, though, since hooved mammals (both kosher and non-kosher) don't have one either, and those would have been far more frequently encountered than the creatures that do have one. So there would have been little reason for anyone to think it obvious that humans should have had a baculum, and then have to create an explanation for its absence.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>'* I see where Sefaria's English translation equates the \"zanav\" with a rib. Could be, but not necessarily.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Shadal_on_Genesis.2.23&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shadal</a> on the verse reads</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עצם מעצמי ובשר מבשרי: זאת היא דומה לי וצורת עצמותיה כצורת עצמי ומראה בשרה כמראה בשרי, והנה היא עצם ממין עצמי ובשר ממין בשרי (תלמידי יוסף ירא), ואח\"כ שפט כי ממנו לוקחה, ואומר לזאת יקרא אשה כי מאיש לוקחה זאת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That Adam was noticing that her bone and flesh structures and appearances mirrored him -- he was not commenting on how she was made, just what she looked like. Afterwards he realized that she was made by taking some portion of him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I can only offer what I've been told by a christian minister, and as such, it might lack some nuance, but the source below captures the background and expounds upon it, if filtered through the lens of \"G-d created women to serve men\" that conservative christianity often looks at the work with.</p>\n\n<p>I was told that the passage is, of course, not strictly literal, and that the english translation loses some of the intention from the original hebrew. The entire phrase, \"bones of my bones, and flesh of my flesh\" is important because \"bone of my bones\" also represents strength of my strength, and \"flesh of my flesh\" communicates a closer \n more personal kinship. Earlier in the passage Adam is seeking a helper, but was unable to find one in the animals so G-d created woman from man.</p>\n\n<p>I did not explain that as eloquently as it was explained to me, but this blog post <a href=\"https://theexplanation.com/bone-of-my-bone-flesh-of-my-flesh-whats-the-relation-to-womanhood/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> goes into the hebrew and primitive hebrew roots of the words in question.</p>\n\n\n",

Maybe it really is God calling on the phone answering one's prayers? Is one allowed to answer the call in the middle of the <em>amidah</em>? Wouldn't a direct phone conversation with God have higher priority over the Amidah where you can't hear God's voice? I would also think that speaking to God over the phone, would be more intimate, and you can get a better sense that God is listening to you knowing he's on the phone.</p>\n<p>Or, do we say that since we are already \"talking\" to God in the Amidah, talking to him on the phone is like \"stereo\" and is confusing? What if God has something important to tell the person? Is it fair to have God leave you a voice message (assuming that he will)?</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Shulchan Aruch O.C. 104:1 says that one may not interrupt the <em>amidah</em> to address a Jewish King. Well, God is a king. However,since God is the king of all humanity, it may beg the question if we could specifically consider God, himself, \"Jewish\" vs. \"multi-religional\".</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

Ber. 30b says that one may not interrupt his Amidah even to respond to a king; 32b elaborates that this applies only with respect to a Jewish monarch, who should recognize that the delay is due to prayer.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly the Supreme Sovereign, B\"H, will know that He has called you while you were davening, and He will leave a callback number.  You should conclude your Amidah swiftly, without any personal petitions during <em>Shema Koleinu</em>.  After you complete your Amidah (and if appropriate the <em>Shaliach Tzibbur</em> has completed the Kedusha) immediately and quietly step out of the room and return the call.

In this case, after completing the call, one's <em>kavanah</em> would be thoroughly all over the place, so it is necessary to restart the Amidah if possible.  (Divine manifestations are known to scramble the senses.

The walls having ears is a different matter entirely that has nothing to do with where you give advice. How does Rashi know this? Simple – it's an explicit verse (Psalms 135):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מעשה ידי אדם פה להם ולא ידברו עינים להם ולא יראו אזנים להם ולא יאזינו</p>\n<p>The creations of man – they have mouths but cannot talk, they have eyes but cannot see, they have ears but cannot hear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is thus clear that walls (which are creations of man) have ears but they cannot hear. So obviously the concern is not that the walls will hear the secrets. The concern is something else entirely.</p>\n<p>The reason why advice should be confined to the field is that, as mentioned a few pages earlier (Berachot 3b), women are not in the fields:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דהא אשה בדברא לא שכיחא</p>\n<p>For a woman in the field is uncommon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it is good to confine advice to the fields because there will be no women there to overhear it.</p>\n<p>But do we find that there is normally a concern of women revealing secrets? Indeed we do! The Talmud (Shabbat 33b) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי תקיף גזירתא א\"ל לבריה נשים דעתן קלה עליהן דילמא מצערי לה ומגליא לן</p>\n<p>When the decree became stronger he said to his son \"women, their minds are flighty on them; perhaps they will torture her and she will reveal us\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Talmud back in Berachot is saying to confine advice to the fields because then no women will overhear it so you won't have to worry that the women will reveal any secrets. Rashi only mentions the fact that walls have ears to tell us that that is <em>not</em> the reason for the Talmud's directive.</p>\n\n\n",

Ben Azzai, a student of Rabbi Akiva, said to him: You were impertinent to your teacher to that extent that you observed that much? He replied: It is Torah, and I must learn.\n  Similarly, we learned in a baraita: Ben Azzai said: I once entered a bathroom after Rabbi Akiva, and I learned three things from observing his behavior: I learned that one should not defecate while facing east and west, but rather while facing north and south; I learned that one should not uncover himself while standing, but while sitting; and I learned that one should not wipe with his right hand, but with his left. Rabbi Yehuda said to him: You were impertinent to your teacher to that extent? He replied: It is Torah, and I must learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly, both Rabbi Akiva and Ben Azzai knew that following one's rabbi into the bathroom was improper in general (with possibly a certain leniency to do it for learning Torah). After having already heard what Rabbi Akiva learned from following Rabbi Yehoshua, why did Ben Azzai feel the need to do exactly what his rabbi, Rabbi Akiva did, by following him - and in fact, ended up learning the exact same things?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If the second event is recorded in the Talmud, there must be a reason.  One possibility is to teach us that we must check things out for ourselves whenever possible, and not take anybody's word for it, however high and mighty he might be.  This can only reinforce our convictions, and must not be used as evidence of lack of trust in our sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is addressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# The expression \"תדע\" in the Gemara\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The expression Teda, תדע, is often found in Gemara, we can translate it as \"<strong>you have to know</strong>\". It is a weak argument, not as a proof from a Mishna or a proof ab absurdo or a logical argument. But it is a kind of argument. I don't understand the utility of the word in its second occurrence of the following Gemara, the Amora can say what he thinks simply without the word Teda:</p>\n<p>Yevamot 92.1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורב נחמן אמר הוראה היא א\"ר נחמן <strong>תדע</strong> דהוראה היא דבכל התורה כולה עד אחד לא מהימן והכא מהימן מ\"ט לאו משום דהוראה היא אמר רבא <strong>תדע</strong> דטעות הוא דאילו הורו ב'ד בחלב ובדם להיתירא והדר חזו טעמא לאיסורא כי הדרי ואמרי להיתירא לא משגחינן להו ואילו היכא דאתא עד אחד שרינא אתו תרי אסרנא כי הדר אתא עד אחרינא שרינן לה מ\"ט לאו משום דטעות הוא</p>\n<p>Rav Nahman, however, stated: [Such an authorization] is [to be regarded as] a ruling. Said Rav Nahman: <strong>You can have proof</strong> that it [is to be regarded as] a ruling. For throughout the Torah a single witness is never believed while in this case he is believed. But why? Obviously because [such an authorization is regarded as] a ruling. Rava said: <strong>You can have proof</strong> that it is [to be regarded as a mere] error. For were Beth din to issue a ruling in a case of some forbidden fat or blood that it is permitted, and then find a [strong] reason for forbidding it, [their subsequent ruling], should they retract and rule again that it is permitted, would be completely disregarded; <em>whereas here, it should one witness present himself, the woman would be permitted to marry again, and should two witnesses [afterwards] appear the woman would be forbidden to marry again, but should another witness subsequently appear the woman would again be permitted to marry. But why? Obviously because it [is regarded as a mere] error</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The translation above is from Soncino. He translates תדע by \"you can have a proof\". But apparently this is not an accurate translation, because Rav Nachman and Rava both don't give a proof from a Berayita or a Mishna. They disagree and say if we have a case A, the behavior of the Bet din will be X. I understand that there is a disagreement between Rav Nachman and Rava in the case described here. An Aguna was permitted by one witness. Further two witnesses contradict the words of the first witness. In a third step, a second single witness came and says that the husband died, but later, his testimony is not identical to the testimony of the first witness. According to Rav Nachman, I assume that this woman loosed this Chazaka Isha Dayika Uminseba, but according to Rava, she didn't lose it, and she can marry, thanks to the second single witness. For Rava there is an error of testimony, for Rav Nachman an error of ruling. I understand the Pshat from Rashi</p>\n<p>Can someone explain the meaning of Teda of Rava when this statement is itself the topic of the discussion?</p>\n<p>Below i give some examples of Teda I understand:</p>\n<p>Berachot 53.2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל ר' נהוראי השמים כן הוא תדע שהרי גוליירין יורדין ומתגרין [במלחמה] וגבורים יורדין ומנצחין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pesachim 16.1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וסבר רבי אלעזר משקין אית להו טומאה בעולם והתניא רבי אלעזר אומר אין טומאה למשקין כל עיקר תדע שהרי העיד (יוסף) בן יועזר איש צרידה על איל קמצא דכן ועל משקין בית מטבחיא דכן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand that \"Teda\" needs to be a weak proof based in a probably but not necessarily link to an admitted truth, not as Ta Shma or Shma Mina, or Matnitin Hee, that are direct proofs.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Both R. Nachman and Rava introduce their statements with the word \"teda\" because both of them are attempting to provide evidence for their immediately preceding statements.</p>\n\n<p>R. Nachman had alleged that in the case in the Mishnah where a woman remarried based on the court's permission (based on the testimony of a single witness that her husband was dead) the woman can be said to have followed a court ruling, and thus be exempt from an offering.</p>\n\n<p>Rava had argued that in this case the woman <strong>cannot</strong> be said to have followed a court ruling, because the court's permission for her to remarry did not constitute a ruling at all; it was merely a factual error akin to the case in the Beraita cited by Zeiri where the court permitted Shabbat desecration on the assumption that the sun had already set, which turned out to be a factual error.</p>\n\n<p>Each <em>amora</em> has to provide evidence to their respective positions. It's very nice to assert that the court's permission was or wasn't a \"ruling\", but how do we know that. Each <em>amora</em> therefore marshals evidence to support his position. R. Nachman points out that in general we do not accept testimony of a lone witness. Thus, here where we do accept the testimony of a lone witness it is perforce a court ruling that we can accept a lone witness's testimony (due to the presumption that a woman will investigate before remarrying). If the woman ended up remarrying without investigating and then it turned out that her husband was actually still alive, the court did not make a factual error (i.e. assuming that the husband was alive when he was in fact dead); rather the court had made an erroneous ruling that the testimony of a lone witness can be relied upon in this situation. This argument is prefaced with the word \"teda\" because \"teda\" introduces the evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Rava constructs a different argument. He notes that in a standard case where a court retracts an erroneous ruling and then tries to reinstate it, they can't reinstate it (at least without new evidence to support the original ruling). Yet in the case of the woman who remarried, if two witnesses later testify that her husband is alive we forbid her (to both men), but if then a new lone witness testifies that her husband has now died, we permit her. If the permission for her to remarry is a court ruling that a lone witness can be relied upon then how could they allow her to remarry again? The fact that two witnesses testified that the husband was still alive after the first witness's testimony demonstrates that the first ruling was erroneous. If so, the court would merely be returning to an erroneous ruling with no new evidence, which we do not allow them to do. Perforce, then, the original permission was not a court ruling; it was merely a factual error promulgated by the lone witness (that the husband was dead when in reality he was alive). Rava's argument is prefaced with the word \"teda\" because he too is citing evidence for his position.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Rava's argument and R. Nachman's argument do not have to be read as responding to each other. Each one can stand on it's own in explicating whether the Mishnah is indeed contradicted by Zeiri's Beraita. They would still each say \"teda\" to introduce their arguments because they are declaring evidence.</p>\n\n<p>(The above is all according to Rashi's understanding of the passage.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that the answer is what I hear from a friend. Since the Mishna doesn't give any restriction to the din permitting a wife by one witness, so this is true even when occurring repetitively. So, the case of Rava is obvious and Rav Nachman can argue against it that this is not a strong proof, and the logical argument is stronger. </p>\n\n<p>And the Teda of Rava is understood easier following the Pshat or the Rav Moshe reported in Ramban, that the second single witness comes to be added to the first to make his testimony a two witnesses testimony and this is universally accredited. But the question was about the Pshat of Rashi.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Praying based on national merit - Early examples\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems to be a common theme in the prayer service that we ask for our needs basing our requests on the mercy of G-d, and, occasionally, on the merit of our forefathers.  Nonetheless, we find some examples where we seem to base our requests on the merit of our actions.  For example, in the Ashkenazi Shacharith Tachanun service of the second and fifth days of the week, we have the supplications:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְחון אם הַמְיַחֲדִים שִׁמְךָ פַּעֲמַיִם בְּכָל יום תָּמִיד בְּאַהֲבָה וְאומְרִים שְׁמַע יִשרָאֵל. ה' אֱלהֵינוּ. ה' אֶחָד:</p>\n<p>...and show favor on the nation that unifies Your name twice daily continuously with love saying: \"Hear Israel, the L-rd our G-d, the L-rd is one.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>as well as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבְכָל זאת שִׁמְךָ לא שָׁכָחְנוּ. נָא אַל תִּשְׁכָּחֵנוּ:</p>\n<p>...and with all this we [still] have not forgotten Your name, please don't forget us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other than the seemingly personal request of David in Psalms 86:2, do we have other, preferably earlier examples of models of prayer seemingly formulated as dependent on the merit of our actions?</p>\n<p>(Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/109523/should-i-pray-to-god-based-on-my-own-merit\">Should I pray to God based on my own merit?</a> )</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the prayer Avinu Malkeinu, when we mention many requests, we also phrase a number of them as being in the merits of members of Klal Yisrael.\nA few of the lines reference the merit of Jews killed for G-d's sake (avoiding discussing what this means, different topic). Some mention children etc. who have never sinned.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, we are not supposed to pray in our own merits. The gemara (brochos) list \"iyun tefillah\" as something which causes the midas hadin. as explained by rashi and other rishonim, when we feel like G-d should answer our prayers because we had so much kavana/focus and prayed so well, it arouses a charge against us in the Heavenly tribunal. The prosecuting angels decide to investigate our prayers and apply strict judgment to evaluate our prayers. </p>\n\n<p>(Rabeinu Bechaye, in Kad Hakemach (I forget where) says this applies to our mitzvos. If we think that G-d should help us because we did a particular good deed, G-d will judge that act strictly to see if we really did it well.)</p>\n\n<p>We are always supposed to approach prayer as asking for undeserved gifts (\"matnas chinam\") as the commentators explain on the verse \"vaeschanan el hashem…\". (Moshe Rabbeinu, at the end of his life, says that he is asking for chinina, an undeserved gift, from hashem.)</p>\n\n\n",

If someone knew about an abundance of mold in the shul, wouldn't you want to know about it, or, maybe close the shul until it's disinfected?</p>\n<p>Why wait until the Shabbat before Rosh Hodesh to inform people about the shul mold? What's special about that time?</p>\n<p>And, why is this common in Ashkenazi shuls? Don't Sefardi shuls announce about mold, or maybe they don't wait until just before Rosh Hodesh to do so?</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

Cohenim are responsible for removing shul tzarrat, but are only permitted to do so after giving Am Yisrael their blessing. Since many Sephardic communities in chutz l'aaretz perform the Birkhat Cohenim at least twice a week, shul tzarrat doesn't get a chance to build up.</p>\n\n\n",

So screws are simply a better and even safer way to assure the mezuza doesn't get knocked (or ripped) off.</p>\n\n<p>The question would be about glue, double-sided tape and other methods that would depend on various factors (like exposure to direct sunshine) if they have the same strength as nails to ensure the Mezuza can never fall or be knocked off the doorpost.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>ב\"ח יורה דעה, רפ״ט:ח׳</strong><br/></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א. וכיצד קובעה <strong>יסמר אותה במסמרים</strong> במזוזות הפתח וכו' כן כתב גם <strong>הרמב\"ם ספ\"ה</strong> ונראה שלמדו להורות כך מהך דבס\"פ השואל דקאמר תלמודא גבי שוכר בית מחבירו דמקום <strong>מזוזה כיון שאין בו מעשה אומן</strong> השוכר עושהו שהרי אפשר הוא בגובתא דקניא ופירש\"י שאפי' מקום מזוזה הוא אבן אין צריך מעשה אומן לנקוב בו סדק להניתה בתוכה דאפשר הוא בגובתא דקניא ותולה אותה עכ\"ל ועל פירוש זה הקשו התוס' בפרק הקומץ (סוף מנחות דף ל\"ב) מדאמר שמואל <strong>תלאה במקל</strong> פסולה ותירצו לא תלי ממש קאמר עכ\"ל <strong>ובמרדכי</strong> <strong>ה' קטנות</strong> ע\"ש רבינו שמשון מבואר התירוץ וז\"ל י\"ל יכניסנו בחלל הקנה ויקבענה בכותל וא\"צ אומן עכ\"ל נראה דר\"ל דיכניסנו בחלל הקנה אורך הקנה כאורך מזוזה שבכתב כמנהג כל ישראל ואחר כן יקבענה בעץ או באבן שהדלת שוקף עליו דאף הוא קרוי מזוזה דהיינו <strong>יסמר אותה בעץ או באבן במסמרים</strong> וזהו שאמר ויקבענה בכותל כלומר במזוזת העץ או האבן שהיא בכותל אבל התוס' בפרק השואל כתבו וז\"ל בגובתא דקניא מכאן נראה כמו שפירש\"י במנחות שמניחין המזוזה מעומד לכן צריך גובתא דקניא <strong>שלא תפול</strong> אבל לפי' ר\"ת שמניחין אותה מיושב כמו ס\"ת מונח בארון ולא מעימד ובמנחות נמי עשאה כמין נגר פסולה היינו מעומד וכו' ואם כן גובתא דקניא למה לי וי\"ל שלא תבלה מלחלוחית הכותל עכ\"ל וצריך לבאר דהתוספות היו תופסים בפשיטית דלא תלי ממש קאמר מדקאמר שמואל בפ' הקומץ תלאה במקל פסולה אלא הכי קאמר דמעמיד גובתא דקניא ארוכה כגובה הפתח בתוך הפתח מן הקורה עד הקרקע ונותן המזוזה שבכתב בתוך אותו הקנה א\"כ מכאן נראה שמניחין המזוזה מעומד לכך צריך גובתא דקניא <strong>שלא תפול</strong> כלומר אבל אם היה קובע דף קטן אורכו לרוחב מזוזת הפתח והיה מעמיד המזוזה שבכתב על הדף בלא גובתא דקניא <strong>היה אפשר שתפול</strong> אבל בגובתא דקניא כדפרישית הרי הוא קבועה בקניא מעומד ו<strong>ליכא למיחש לנפילה</strong> אבל לפר\"ת שמניח אותה מיושב כו' קשה אם כן גובתא דקניא למה לי יניח המזוזה שבכתב כמו שהיא בלא גובתא דקניא על הדף הקטן כדאמרן ויניחנה מיושב כמו ס\"ת מונח בארון ושוב ודאי לא יפול ותירצו שלא תבלה מלחלוחית הכותל כנ\"ל לפרש דבור זה הסתום בעיני הלומדים והשתא לפ\"ז מבואר <strong>דאין צריך לקובעו במסמרים</strong> בין לפירש\"י בין לפר\"ת אלא צריך לומר <strong>דלמצוה מן המובחר כי היכי דלא ליתי לידי זלזול ע\"י נפילה בחשש רחוק יסמר במסמרים</strong> דהשתא ליכא חששא דנפילה כל עיקר אפי' בחשש רחוק ודו\"ק. שוב מצאתי בירושלמי פ' בתרא דמגילה רבי בא בשם ר' יהודה ואפי' לא סמרו והא תני והוא שסמרו א\"ר יוסי והוא שייחדו לכן עכ\"ל נראה דכך פירושו דוקא כשהוא מייחד מזוזה זו לפתח זה צריך שיסמרו אבל אם אינה מייחדה אלא לפי שעה א\"צ שיסמרו וז\"ל לשם של בית מליון היו עושין כן בפולמסיות פי' כשהיו הולכין עם החיילות היו קובעין מזוזה לפי שעה ולא סמרו:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Assume the painting will take 2 weeks, to paint all the rooms.  Assume that painting any one room (and doorway) will take 2 days (for prep and priming and then paining two coats), so any one room/doorway will have no mezuza for at least one overnight and perhaps as much as 2-3 days.  How long may a house or room be without a mezuza and you still be allowed to live in it?  It is necessary to put up a mezuzza as soon as each coat of plaster or paint is dry, or can replacing the mezuzot be done when all the painting is completed?<br><br> Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/96185/source-that-every-room-in-the-house-needs-a-mezuza\">Source that every room in the house needs a mezuza</a></p>\n\n\n",

When he gets there, there's a huge feast being served. There are delicacies galore. Anything you could ever want is being served, and the host of the feast is none other than the Creator of Heaven and Earth, HaKadosh Baruch Hu himself. The tzadik is beside himself with excitement. He takes a seat at the table and peruses a menu with excitement while he waits for a waiter to come to take his order. When the waiter comes, the man says, \"This feast looks fantastic! Could you please tell me, under whose hashgacha is this amazing spread?\" The waiter replies, \"Sir, this is Olam HaBa. We are in the presence of HaShem and he himself ensures that everything is up to the kosher standards he has given us in the Torah.\" The tzadik nervously replies, \"Thank you for that information. I will have the fruit plate, please.\"</p>\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is that the standards of HaShem's hashgacha, as published in the Torah, are not up to the stringent halakhic standards the sophisticated kosher consumer demands. Glatt Kosher? He never said anything about that. Not to mention the chicken and cheese combinations. If we want to ensure that we're only eating foods that meet the highest levels of kashrus, we must rely on human mashgichim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is one specific areas of kashrut that requires human intervention.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>batul beshishim</em> principle was based on taste. Does the milk impart a milky taste to the meat or does the meat impart a meaty taste to the dairy dish? God has no taste. Well, actually, He has extremely <strong>good</strong> taste in choosing the Jewish people, but, in terms of tasting dairy and meaty food, these concepts don't apply to him. Thus, you would need human involvement. </p>\n\n<p>But of greater concern is that there are thousands of mashgichim throughout the world whose employment and sole source of income depends on hashgacha. You would be eliminating all these jobs and create tremendous poverty. It's not good for the economy.</p>\n\n<p>Another angle to consider. If you left all of the supervision to God, this would be what is called <em>hashgacha pratit</em> - private hashgacha. That's good in situations where an individual needs specific help out of a tough situation, or Hashem wants to be benevolent and protect someone. But, the point is, that such hashgacha is private and geared for the individual.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of <em>hashgacha pratit</em> couldn't apply to food products available for public use. It wouldn't be <em>pratit</em> - private- would it?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "If a Gett is given on condition the husband does not return what is considered \"returning\"?",
    "content": "# If a Gett is given on condition the husband does not return what is considered \"returning\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apologies if this is answered simply elsewhere -- I haven't studied the laws of <em>Gittin</em>, but this question doesn't seem to be addressed in the connected <em>mishna</em> in Gittin 76a.</p>\n\n<p>In Ketuvot, 2b, the text establishes a case -- If a man gives his wife a Gett (divorce) which only becomes valid if he does not \"return\" within 30 days and then, on day 30, he is stuck on the other side of a river from where they live, the <em>Gett</em> becomes valid. People clearly can see him and hear him from across the river  (the text indicates that he, from his side \"said to them Look, I have come!\" and there is no response that \"they can't hear him.\")</p>\n\n<p>So what constitutes fully returning? If he crossed the river but stayed on the river bank? Does he have to reach a specific location, or just the city limits? (the earlier formulation was \"i have come\" which is not the same as \"returned\" but this distinction isn't explored here as location isn't spoken of)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemora 76b asks regarding the case of  \"it should be a Get now if i don't come back here in 12 months time (same would apply with returning to where she lives in 30 days)\". How can we even know that he really came back to where his wife lives if the stipulation is between the husband and wife (i.e he could just say he came back and she'll never be divorced (<em>megureshes misafeik</em>)as we don't believe her denial)?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מעכשיו אם לא באתי מכאן ועד י\"ב חדש ומת בתוך י\"ב חדש ה\"ז גט וליחוש שמא פייס אמר רבה בר רב הונא הכי אמר אבא מרי משמיה דרב באומר נאמנת עלי לומר שלא באתי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbah bar Huna answers that he has to make a stipulation that his wife is believed to say that he did not come. i.e when he personally comes back to where she lives and sees her personally  he is divorced. Even if he comes to the house and she doesn't see him it is not considered coming back. </p>\n\n<p>So too in the questioners case the husband completely trusts his wife, so when the husband is waiving on the other side of the river at his wife but has not physically returned to city where he lives, seeing her has no relevance until he returns into his town because thats what she wants and its dependant on her (it seems under normal circumstances returning to their town is good enough to fulfil the stipulation for her if she sees him their). However if she considers only going to her house returning she is also believed as its dependant on her word. </p>\n\n\n",

So, although the later usage was closer to that of a moron, the original idea it represented was in fact a rather exalted one. Thus, the statement that one has reached the position of Moron D’asra really conveys a deeply rooted historical definition as to why a moron is indeed not a moron, rather a saint.

This minhag is mentioned in r'mo and he adds one must not be mevatel it or laugh at it. According to my reasonlng it is quite simple because if they did, it would stop people becoming shikkur being ashamed afterwards when they 'klop' by mistake, and being shikkur is a great mitsva. One could add even that is why everyone should 'klop' not to shame those who are not shikkur, like we find many things, and there is nothing worse than not being shikkur on purim. And it being such a big mistake it deserves a lot of 'klopping'. Therefore it is wrong what some readers repeating 'haman' again after the 'klopping' ,making the mistake once is bad enough. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As a <em>ba'al Kri'ah</em>, I think I need to correct you regarding protocol.</p>\n\n<p>During the Shabbat Torah reading, nobody clops (what are you?

It is also עבודה מיראה, and through his suffering Iyov transitions to עבודה מאהבה with a complete change in how he relates to God.</p>\n<p>The turning point in Iyov's attitude is in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Job.13.15?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 13:15</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֵ֣ן יִ֭קְטְלֵנִי לא [ל֣וֹ] אֲיַחֵ֑ל אַךְ־דְּ֝רָכַ֗י אֶל־פָּנָ֥יו אוֹכִֽיחַ׃</p>\n<p>He may well slay me; I may have no hope; Yet I will argue my case before Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As written, it means that if God were to slay him he would no longer hope, but as read it means that even were God to slay him he would continue to trust in God. Someone who serves out of fear cannot continue serving if all hope is lost, because their motivation in serving God is for protection for evil. When he serves from love, from an understanding of God's purpose in the world, he will maintain his dedication to God even in the face of death, because he would understand that his death is part of God's design. Here Iyov transitions from saying 'at the point of death I abandon God' to saying 'in the face of death I hold by my faith in God'. (There is also a קרי/כתיב <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/snoegel/PDFs/articles/Noegel%2014%20-%20JBL%201996.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Janus parallelism</a> here, with the כתיב fitting with the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Job.13.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">preceding passuk</a>, and the קרי goes with the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Job.13.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following passuk</a>.)</p>\n<p>At the begining of the sefer Iyov is <em>acting</em> as a tzaddik, but he has not developed the personality, outlook, and attitudes of being a tzaddik, so it makes sense that his \"name\" is still what it was as a child, so the passuk uses the form of איוב שמו.</p>\n\n\n",

Good effective masks are unavailable.)</p>\n\n<p>In every shul I have ever been to, noisemakers  are provided or brought to drown out the name of Haman as it is read. I've been taught that was part of the punishment for his evildoing, that his name be erased. </p>\n\n<p>In the online reading I attended, the baal koreh muted all attendees, as otherwise the background noise would have made the session unpleasant. However, that left me with few options to avoid hearing <em>that name</em>.  I drummed my fingers on the keyboard but that wasn't very loud, and the name came through quite intelligibly. </p>\n\n<p>I thought about muting the reading for each occurrence, but that would have been tough to do and would have likely lost me some other words.</p>\n\n<p>So, a few questions:</p>\n\n<p>(1) Is there anything Halachically objectionable about a megilla reading where you can hear the name?</p>\n\n<p>(2) Is there any minhag for online Megilla reading that would cover this?</p>\n\n<p>(And please note that while I'd certainly enjoy reading some Purim Torah on the subject, this is a real question and I'm looking for a real answer.) </p>\n\n<p>And note:  the comments from before I edited the question seem to imply that the minhag I've been taught all my life, which has been followed in every shul I've ever been to in a dozen cities, is not only wrong, but so completely wrong that people didn't even understand the point of my question.  I'm not sure how to rectify this. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The requirement of the megillah reading is to hear every word (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.690.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch O\"C 690:3</a>), including Haman's name.</p>\n\n<p>There is a minhag to make noise \"as if\" you're drowning out Haman's name (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.690.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ram\"a O\"C 690:17</a>), but this is always done <em>after</em> saying Haman (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.690.60\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 690:60</a>).  Sometimes, when people get too into it and start making noise early, the person reading the megillah will say Haman again after they finish in order to make sure everyone heard it.</p>\n\n<p>This minhag is not practiced by everyone, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/36428/11532\">some poskim disapprove</a>.  When I read the megillah, it's a little stressful sometimes to pinpoint the moment people started making noise and figure out if I have to repeat Haman.</p>\n\n<p>Even in places that have the minhag, it's definitely not a requirement.  The earliest readings, which cater to people who go to work, typically will do it just for the first and last times Haman's name appears, if they do it at all.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've never seen a shul that actually drowns out Haman's name.  If there's a place that does, you should really talk to the rabbi about it and/or go somewhere else.  If you're stuck, note that while you have to hear the whole megillah, you only have to hear 50.001% of it <em>from a kosher scroll</em>.  So you can just say \"Haman\" yourself (together with any prefixes להמן or words connected to it את-המן).  Same goes for any other words you miss, like if you sneeze or something.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the Parsha listed on the Torah Portion schedule each Shabbat begin or end on the date it is listed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(How to determine what parshat is current when looking at a parshat calendar?)</p>\n\n<p>Each Torah Portion is listed on Shabbath in the parshat calendars.  In the Western world, when an event that lasts an entire week(such as the torah parsha), it will begin on the day it is listed and continues on for another 6 days on the calendar.</p>\n\n<p>But apparently in the parsha calendar, the parsha listed on Saturday is the one that should have been being read the entire week preceding it.</p>\n\n<p>So is it correct to say that when we see a Torah portion listed on Saturday, this means we should be finishing that parsha on that date not beginning it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not sure what you see on a calendar and what dates are listed. Most Hebrew calendar or Hebrew / English calendars that I see just put the name of the parsha on a Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>But, essentially, the first reading of the week's parsha begins on the Shabbat afternoon of the week before the week listed. (Unless there is an intervening Yom Tov which would defer that parsha to the following week or maybe even 2 weeks later.)</p>\n\n<p>As an example:</p>\n\n<p>If you see pasrhat Va'era listed on the calendar on Shabbat 26 Tevet, it means that the first reading of the first aliyah of Va'era will begin Shabbat mincha of 19 Tevet, and again on Monday 21 Tevet and again on Thursday 24 Tevet. The full parsha Va'era of 7 aliyot is read on Shabbat 26 Tevet.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat mincha of 26 Tevet will start the following week's parsha, Bo.</p>\n\n<p>FYI - Some wedding invitations will include the parsha name as well. E.g. it may say - יום שני בשבת פרשת בא - The 2nd day of the week (Monday) for parshat Bo, which would be read on the upcoming Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>In situations when a weekly parsha is not read, it would probably state the Yom Tov that is occurring, instead. I'm not completely certain about that.</p>\n\n\n",

Everyone was nervous and they realized the wine was there, they were scared of the wine and what it would unveil. This idea my rebbe said can be proved from the Midrashim, the Midrashim talk about how each participant was very nervous.

    "content": "# Contradiction in Rashi regarding why the Jews did not take the spoils at Purim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16481/showrashi/true#v11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 8:11</a>, Rashi explains that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהֵם בַּבִּזָּה לֹא שָׁלְחוּ אֶת יָדָם, שֶׁהֶרְאוּ לַכֹּל שֶׁלֹּא נַעֲשָׂה לְשֵׁם מָמוֹן</p>\n  \n  <p>They \"did not send forth their hand in the spoils,\" to show everyone that they did not do it for the sake of money.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16482/jewish/Chapter-9.htm/showrashi/true#v10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 9:10</a>, Rashi gives a different reasoning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שֶׁלֹּא יִתֵּן הַמֶּלֶךְ עַיִן צָרָה בַּמָּמוֹן</p>\n  \n  <p>So that the king not put a stingy eye against their money.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first reasoning seems to be to make a Kiddush Hashem, that they're fighting solely for the sake of self-defense and would not take the spoils which were rightfully theirs. Yet the second reasoning seems to be much more materialistic: had they taken the money, the king probably would have seized it anyway.</p>\n\n<p>How does one reconcile these two statements of Rashi? Further, why does Rashi give each explanation where he does, rather than mentioning both in the same place?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>When one looks at the order of Megilat Ester one would realize that the war does not happen yet. Rashi writes that the reason the Jews did not take the money was to show everyone that this was not for the sake of money. </p>\n\n<p>The question is Why is this Rashi here? It's in the wrong place, we did not go to war yet. Thus how could the Jews even take money? By the next Rashi in perek 9  we went to war and we could have taken the money but we did not. the question is why is Rashi in a strange place.</p>\n\n<p>עמנואל הרומי על אסתר on peruk 8 pasuk 11 writes that Mordechai was involved in the writing of the bill which appears in perek 8 pasuk 11. I shall prove it- why do we care that Mordechai became a high ranking official in the government that the text itself tells us just a few pesukim before our first Rashi? The reason is that Mordechai was directly involved in the writing of the bill. How could Mordechai be involved in the writing? only if he was a high ranking official of the king.</p>\n\n<p>The thing that is bothering Rashi is that why did Mordechai include the Money aspect of the bill? Mordechai included it to make a kiddush-Hashem and show the people of Persia that even though the Jews could take the money they will not. The next Rashi that you mentioned gives us a glimpse inside the mind of the people. Their reason was not as noble as Mordechai's reason, they just did not want to deal with Achashverosh. </p>\n\n<p>With my answer, there is one problem. How can I say Rashi says that the other jews did not have the purest of intentions? To answer that I must turn to Rav Chaim Shmuelevits.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Shmuelevits in his Sichot Mussar on Parshat Ki Tisa asks how could the jews who just experienced so many great miracles could have gone so low and did such a great sin such as the SIn of the Golden calf, Gilui-arayot and killing Chur? Rav Chaim mentions the famous statement from Chazal that ראתה שׁפחה על הים מה שלא ראה יחזקאל בן בּוזי  [Even a maidservant was able, at the spitting of the red sea to perceive the divine what Yechezkel ben Buzi could not grasp.]  Rav Chaim asks why are they called maidservants, they should be called a prophetess? </p>\n\n<p>\"The answer is that revelations and unique events on their own do not create prophets. A person may experience a lofty awareness, a lucid perception of the divine, yet remain the same person. His/her knowledge and awareness will not necessarily affect any change in personality whatsoever. The maidservant, after her experience at the sea, retailed the same humble stature that she possessed before the event.\"</p>\n\n<p>This principle of an incredible divine revelation happens but it affects no change in the beholder because he/she did nothing for it, thus it won't last. The average jew did nothing to save them. It was all Mordechai and Ester. It is true they fasted and prayed, but they did not really do much thus they had different attitudes. when did the Jews take an active role and make this amazing divine revelation last? when they built the second Beis Hamikdash. They retained this great miracle and made it part of them, but till then they did nothing and it would not change who they were inside.</p>\n\n\n",

And the people will go out and gather a day’s portion every day, in order to test them, [to see] whether they observe the precepts of my Law or not.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The footnote for this verse in the English translation provides the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>The manna was among the ten things which, according to rabbinic tradition, were \ncreated on the eve of the first sabbath.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus the manna from heaven was stored (<em>“reserved”</em>) in heaven since the first Sabbath (“<em>from the beginning</em>”), and only given to the Israelites when they were traveling in the desert with Moses. The exact same verb form occurs again several verses later, and the translation is the same with the translated verb noted in bold italics:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup>15</sup> When the children of Israel saw [it], they were amazed, and they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread <strong><em>that was reserved</em></strong> for you from the beginning in the heavens on high; and now the Lord is giving it to you to eat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>English translations taken from:</p>\n\n<p>Cathcart, K., Maher, M., & McNamara, M.

The gemara <em>brachos 60a</em> (ArtScroll 60a3) explains that once something has been determined, even if the person does not know it, one cannot daven for the change. Note also the example of the house on fire. In the example in Bava Metzia, the amount of grain is not necessarily fixed as Hashem can cause it to increase without an obvious miracle as one can assume that that was the amount of grain present from the first. That is why the gemara gives a different bracha before he begins to count it and in the middle of counting it. In the case of a infant, since the normal determination is even in the first 40 days, one cannot <strong>normally</strong> pray. Art Scroll on that daf note 24 points to <em>Avudraham</em> in his explanation of the weekday morning service. If a person is aware of the sign that specifies the future sex, then it is improper to pray for a neis.</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll Brachos 60a3 note 25:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Since one cannot be certain who emitted seed first,] one can always\n  pray for a particular gender within 40 days (<em>Tur, Orach Chaim 230</em>)\n  for perhaps they emitted their seed at the same time (<em>Pri Megadim</em> to\n  <em>Magen Avraham 230:1</em>; see also <em>Sifsei Chachamim</em> in explanation of <em>Rashi</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thus and more may the LORD do to me if anything but death parts me from you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi to verse 16 explains both verses in one shot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי אֶל אֲשֶׁר תֵּלְכִי אֵלֵךְ. מִכַּאן אָמְרוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ זִכְרוֹנָם לִבְרָכָה, גֵּר שֶׁבָּא לְהִתְגַּיֵּר מוֹדִיעִין לוֹ מִקְצַת עֳנָשִׁים, שֶׁאִם בָּא לַחֲזֹר בּוֹ יַחֲזֹר, שֶׁמִּתּוֹךְ דְּבָרֶיהָ שֶׁל רוּת אַתָּה לָמֵד מַה שֶּׁאָמְרָה לָהּ נָעֳמִי. \"אָסוּר לָנוּ לָצֵאת חוּץ לַתְּחוּם בַּשַּׁבָּת\". אָמְרָה לָהּ, \"בַּאֲשֶׁר תֵּלְכִי אֵלֵךְ\". \"אָסוּר לָנוּ לְהִתְיַחֵד נְקֵבָה עִם זָכָר שֶׁאֵינוֹ אִישָׁהּ\". אָמְרָה לָהּ, \"בַּאֲשֶׁר תָּלִינִי אָלִין\". \"עַמֵּנוּ מֻבְדָּלִים מִשְּׁאָר עַמִּים בְּתַרְיַ\"ג מִצְוֹת\", \"עַמֵּךְ עַמִּי\". \"אָסוּר לָנוּ עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים, \"אֱלֹהַיִךְ אֱלֹהָי\". \"אַרְבַּע מִיתוֹת נִמְסְרוּ לְבֵית דִּין, \"בַּאֲשֶׁר תָּמוּתִי אָמוּת\". \"שְׁנֵי קְבָרִים נִמְסְרוּ לְבֵית דִּין, אֶחָד לְנִסְקָלִין וְנִשְׂרָפִין וְאֶחָד לְנֶהֱרָגִין וְנֶחְנָקִין\". אָמְרָה לָהּ, \"וְשָׁם אֶקָּבֵר\":</p>\n<p><strong>For wherever you go, I shall go.</strong> From here our Rabbis of blessed memory derived that if a [prospective] proselyte comes to convert, we inform him of some of the punishments [for violating the commandments] so that is he decides to renege [from his intention to convert], he can renege; for out of the words of Rus, you can learn what Naomi said to her. [Naomi said.] “We may not venture outside the boundary [of 2000 cubits beyond city limits] on Shabbos.” She [Rus] replied to her, “For wherever you go I shall go.” [Naomi then said,] “We are prohibited to allow a woman to be secluded with a man who is not her husband.” She [Rus] replied, “Where you lodge, I will lodge.” [Naomi said,] “Our nation is separated from other nations by 613 commandments,” [and Rus replied,] “Your people are my people.” [Naomi said,] “Idolatry is forbidden to us,” [to which Rus replied,] “Your God is my God.” [Naomi then said,] “Four [types of] death penalties were delegated to Beis Din [to punish transgressors],” [and Rus replied,] “Where you die, I will die.” [Naomi continued,] “Two burial plots were delegated to Beis Din [to bury those executed], one for those stoned and those burned, and one for those decapitated and those strangled.” She [Rus] replied, “And there I shall be buried.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is very common. In fact, I found all three examples by flipping randomly through my mikraos gedolos to the chamesh megillos. As you learn more, you will find more too. Happy hunting!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If you look at an Artscroll/chumash in the pasuk itself there are 3 קול ענות. </p>\n\n<p>Quoting the arsctoll rashi page 454 point one \"the spelling ענות appears three times in our verse, but the vowelization changes. The first two times the word ענות is spelled with a chataf patach under the ע and without a dagesh in the נ.

There really should be no problem with the plural anyways since the Hebrew Elokim is plural and can have verbs and modifying words in the plural as well.  To prove this, in Bereishit 20:13 ד״ה כאשר התעו Rashi gives a thorough explanation of how Elokim can take verbs in the plural.  This wouldn’t require Rashi to find a solution as it is grammatically correct on a pshat level. </p>\n\n<p>How then can Rashi prove that they wanted many gods if he himself in Bereishit stated that it is normal and grammatically acceptable to have plural verbs for Elokim?  Why doesn’t Rashi accept that maybe it was only one G-d they wanted?</p>\n\n\n",

In Bereshit Rabbah 28,9, Rabbi Acha son of Kahana expresses surprise at the words ונח מצא חן בעיני ה', saying that the wording implies that Noach, in his own right, could not have claimed the right of survival, except for the circumstance that he “found favour in the eyes of the Lord, i.e. G’d had to search for a reason to let him survive.

Below is a quote from\n Minchas Yitzchok.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תלוי ב<strong>שמיעת הש\"ץ</strong> המבואר (באו\"ח סי' קכד), ו<strong>ברואים זה את זה</strong>, והיינו\n  אפילו אם המה בשני חדרים לגמרי, ומקורו מדברי הרשב\"א (בתשובה סי' צו).\n  ואף דלהלכה יש חולקים ומחמירים וכמבואר שם בשערי תשובה (אות מז), מכל\n  מקום באין מחיצה מפסיק ביניהם, אף שאינם בבית אחד אלא בשדה שפיר יש לומר\n  דמהני רואים זה את זה לכו\"ע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n\n<p>Regarding indoor Minyanim, there is another possible requirement, subject to debate between the Poskim. Some require all members of the minyan to be in the same room (without a halachic mechitza); others require at least ten to be in the same room - after which others can be <em>mitztaref</em> from another room; some permit even if the minyan is split between two rooms (as long as there is no public domain in between them).</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (55:13) requires all participants of the minyan to be in one place. [See further, how this limitation can be circumvented.]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צריך שיהיו כל העשרה במקום אחד ושליח צבור עמהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the laws of <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Zimmun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zimun</a> (where a minyan is required to add the Divine Name אלקינו), ten people are considered a minyan even if they are split between two rooms, provided that they can see each other (see Shulchan Aruch 195). The Rashba (Responsa 91) says it's possible this law extends to Tefilla as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוד אני אומר שאפשר לומר שכל שרואים אלו את אלו כאילו הן בבית אחד דמי\n  ומצטרפים. ודומיא דזימון של ברכת המזון דתנן (ברכות פ\"ז מ\"ה) שתי חבורות\n  שהיו אוכלות בבית אחד בזמן שמקצתם רואים אלו את אלו, הרי אלו מצטרפים\n  לזימון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This suggestion of the Rashba is codified by the <em>Mishneh Berurah</em> (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%94#%D7%A0%D7%91_%D7%9E%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 55, Note 52</a>) and <em>Biur Halachah</em> (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad loc</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Other authorities disagree - see, for example, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1095&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishkenos Yackov (#75)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Reshus Harabim</em> splitting a minyan</strong></p>\n\n<p>The source to permit minyanim in two different places is based on the Rashba, who equates the rules of <em>tefilla</em> to that of <em>zimmun</em>. Accordingly, one of the caveats that applies by <em>zimmun</em> will also be relevant here.</p>\n\n<p>In the laws of Zimmun, the Shulchan Aruch (195) writes that when two groups are joining together to form a minyan, a <em>reshus harabim</em> passing in between is <em>mafsik</em> (breaks the connection):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שתי חבורות שאוכלות בבית אחד או בשני בתים, אם מקצתן רואים אלו את אלו\n  מצטרפות לזימון, ואם לאו אינם מצטרפות... <strong>ויש מי שאומר שאם רשות הרבים\n  מפסקת בין שני הבתים, אינם מצטרפין בשום ענין</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Although the Shulchan Aruch quotes 'יש אומרים', which leads some to suggest that in a time of pressing need this opinion can be disregarded, the Kaf HaChaim writes that there is no opinion who disagrees.]</p>\n\n<p>The Pri Megadim (Ashel Avraham, OC 55) rules that this limitation applies to <em>tefilla</em> too:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן מה שכתוב שם  רשות הרבים מפסקת אין מצטרף, הוא הדין כאן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Taz (195:2, quoted in Mishneh Berurah) explains that the definition of <em>reshus harabim</em> in this context is different to the regular definition in regards to Shabbos, and here it includes even a private pathway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה דלאו דוקא רהות הרבים ממש שהוא רחב י״ו אמות אלא אפי׳ שביל היחיד מפסיק\n  ביניהם כדתנן ריש פאה ומייתי לה בחזקת הבתים דף נ״ה דזה מפסיק בין\n  הרשויות לפאה ולשבת וא״כ ה״ה נמי כאן דחד טעמא הוא עם רה״ר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some contemporary poskim (see <a href=\"http://beinenu.com/sites/default/files/alonim/412_69_80.2_0.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Moshe Shternbuch</a>) ruled that this problem applies only to those standing on ground floor; those in upper level floors standing on balconies would not suffer from this problem.

Modern Rulings</p>\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Yosef David Azulai (Chida, 18th cen., Israel; Machazik Berakhah 55:11) discusses a case of quarantine in Italy, in which guards would not allow people in two adjacent houses to mix. Chida felt that if the four men of one family could stand outside the open door of the second house which had six men so that they can all see each other, even though the four are forbidden to enter the house, they could join as a minyan based on Rashba’s condition of being able to see each other. However, his colleague Rav Yosef Chazan (18-19th cen., Turkey; Chikrei Lev, Orach Chaim 1:28) argues at length against following this difficult minority opinion, even in a case of quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>Citing this Chikrei Lev and many other similar strict rulings, Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel, Rav Yosef Yitzchak, in a recent responsum forbids participation in a porch minyan (but allows answering amen if such a minyan is taking place). Similarly, Rav Hershel Schachter in a recent responsum distinguishes between prayer (which is a davar she-bi-kdushah) to a zimun (which is not), and therefore forbids porch minyanim. Rav Schachter points to a contradiction within Bi’ur Halakhah whether to follow Rashba or Rashbash and concludes that we cannot rely on Rashba even in a time of great need.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Weiss, in a recent responsum, allows relying on Rashba’s leniency in this time of great need and permits porch minyanim if people can see each other (setting aside the issues mentioned at the beginning of this essay). However, he points out that even regarding zimun, you cannot join together with someone across a street. Therefore, all the porches must be on the same side of the street. Rav Moshe Sternbuch, in a recent responsum, rules leniently also but adds another leniency — if the people are standing on porches 10 tefachim above street level, then they can join even across the street. In a responsum unrelated to Coronavirus, Rav Yitzchak Zilberstein was asked whether Jewish guards and prisoners, who are forbidden to mix, can join for a minyan through prison bars (Chashukei Chemed, Pesachim 85b). Rav Zilberstein says that you can rely on the Chida but is not entirely comfortable relying on it for people in a holding cell, who will only be there for a short time. It seems that he would rule leniently for those in long-term quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>Because this is so current a question, I urge everyone to ask their rabbi before putting anything into practice, especially considering the other very important considerations mentioned above.\"</p>\n\n<p>Part one of the posting is titled \"I.

    "content": "# Rabbis giving advice which contradicts expert medical opinion\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have read many stories of great Rabbis, historically and in today's times, who have given people medical advice which was in direct contradiction to the advice given by expert medical professionals. Often times these stories are situations of life or death decisions where the doctor is saying that if the advice of the Rabbi is followed the patient will likely die. The stories all turn out with the patient listening to the Rabbi over the doctor and everything turns out well for the patient. It is my understanding that in regards to a medical question the halacha is that a person should (must?) follow the advice of medical experts and not rely on a miracle. I would like to understand what basis, if any are Rabbis allowed to give such advice and if the patient is allowed to follow the advice, why? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> I am <strong>not</strong> asking about a situation where a Rabbi has as much medical knowledge (or more) than the experts and is therefore giving his advice in the capacity as a medical expert</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When the great rabbis had ruach hakodesh, they were better trusted, even over the words of a doctor. In today's generation we don't know who has ruach hakodesh. There may not even be ruach hakodesh in today's generation. I heard people say that Rav Chaim Kaniefsky has Ruach hakodesh, but we don't know if he does.

Kyrios simply means ‘master, owner, lord’.</p>\n<p>What was the reason why the Jews specifically used the substitute Adonay/Kyrios for the Tetragrammaton?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The English word “God” (“got” in German and “Godh” in Iceland) is derived from a root to call, meaning to call upon. It does not denote an anthropomorphic and anthropopathic being. For G-d has no human form and emotion. The Torah describes G-d as a “he” because, as Rabbi Ishmael said, “The Torah speaks in human language,” so that humans can understand. For example, the Torah may say G-d becomes angry if people sin. This is untrue. But it helps prevent people from acting wrongly. The Jewish sage Maimonides partly failed in his mission to remove anthropomorphisms and anthropopathic characteristics of G-d. For example, Ravad criticized him when he said that far smarter men felt that G-d was anthropomorphic (meaning that G-d has a body,) and today, many Jews still think that G-d has emotions.</p>\n\n<p>The name El, which means “powerful”; denotes that G-d is more powerful than anything else. For example, “Elohim,” (Elokim) a plural form of “El” (keil) represents “the most powerful.” This explains why some ancient idolatrous cultures used the term el for their idols because they wrongly believed these statues were powerful. Similarly, it is a misconception that the biblical y-h-v-h is G-d’s name because Y-h-v-h describes G-d’s essence. \"Names\" in the Torah often indicate “essence” or “power.” They are expressions for a powerful force. For example, when Moses asks G-d's name in 13-15, G-d replies e’ye asher e’ye. E’ye and y-h-v-h share a root which means “being,” G-d is what was and what will be.</p>\n\n<p>When the Jews translated the Bible into Greek called the Septuagint in Egypt around 250 BCE, the 72 scribes substituted y-h-v-h for the Greek curios, meaning Lord. They later substituted it for Adonai, which also means Lord in Hebrew. Some even substitute Adonai for Hashem, meaning the Name. The Babylonian Talmud, Pesachim 50a, mandates to read y-h-v-h as Adonai. As time progressed, Jews felt the need to substitute God for G-d in writing (out of respect). When the Masorites added vowels Jews retained the consonants without pronunciation of y-h-v-h, but it is not Jehovah. Thus, the \"names\" of G-d in the Hebrew Bible are the essences of G-d, not names.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Bible calls G-d Y-h-v-h, which is called “the Tetragrammaton,” which means a four-letter word. While the Tetragrammaton appears on Torah scrolls, even today, Jews say it as Adonai whenever they read the Torah (more on that later).</p>\n<p>Many think that this is the name of G-d in the Hebrew Bible, but this is not true. It is a description of how G-d functions in the universe. Thus, when Moses asks G-d in 3:13, the people “will say to me, ‘What is His name?’ what should I say to them?” G-d replies, “‘I am that I am’.\" Virtually all Jewish commentators and rabbis understand verse 14 to be saying that this is describing how G-d functions or acts. It is not a name.</p>\n<p>Since ancient times, Jews have avoided using the Tetragrammaton out of respect around 250 BCE. When they translated the Bible into Greek in Egypt, they substituted the Tetragrammaton for the Greek word Kurios, which means “Lord.” Around 250 the Jews began to substitute Kurios for the Hebrew version of Kurios, Adonai, which also means “Lord.” Eventually, Jews began to treat Adonai as the Tetragrammaton and reverted to the new circumlocution Hashem, meaning The Name. Out of respect, Jews no longer use Adonai, substituting Hashem in its place. Yet others went as far as to write the word \"God\" as G-d.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the word “Elohim” is not a name for G-d but a function. In English it is G-d. The word \"el\" is the singular of Elohim, which means “powerful.” Idols, too, are called \"el\", because the ancients felt that these idols were also powerful.

Now that so many of us are davening without a minyan, I thought it would be beneficial to list all of the omissions and modifications that apply in this circumstance.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these are fairly easy:  we omit <em>barchu</em>, all <em>kaddishes</em>, and the repetition of the Amidah. Before reciting <em>shema</em> we add the phrase <em>el melech ne'eman</em>.  But some are less obvious: for example, when the Torah is not read (because there is no minyan) but one still reads the parsha from a chumash, do we recite <em>Ein Kamocha</em> and the other prayers that precede and conclude the Torah reading?  Or do you just go from the end of the Shacharit amidah directly on to musaf?  (Actually, I'm pretty sure that's wrong; my siddur says that one omits the second <em>yekum purkan</em> when davening without a minyan, so presumably the first one is read.  But what about <em>ashrei</em>, <em>av harachamim</em>, etc.?)</p>\n\n<p>The question, then, is: What is the complete list of omissions and modifications made when davening Shabbat morning without a minyan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> the following is composed for those who use Nusach Ashkenaz and is not complete.</p>\n\n<p>Shacharit</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>חצי קדיש</li>\n<li>ברכו</li>\n<li>חזרת הש\"ץ</li>\n<li>קדיש שלם</li>\n<li>הוצאת ספר תורה (I would infer that since we omit ﭏ ארך אפים on weekdays without a minyan, that those whose nusach includes אין כמוך באלהים should omit it, although CYLOR)</li>\n<li>My rav has indicated that we should review the פרשת השבוע at this point, although CYLOR</li>\n<li>the second יקום פרקן and the מי־שברך for the קהל\n– הכנסת ספר תורה</li>\n<li>שיר היחוד </li>\n<li>שיר הכבוד</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

While the first passuk establishes the base case, the second passuk establishes that this applies to even a daytime plague. What's puzzling to me is the rationale behind the necessity for the third passuk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכי תימא ה\"מ [היכא] דליכא אימה מגואי אבל היכא דאיכא אימה מגואי כי נפיק יתיב ביני אינשי בצוותא בעלמא טפי מעלי ת\"ש מחוץ תשכל חרב ומחדרים אימה אע\"ג דמחדרים אימה מחוץ תשכל חרב</p>\n  \n  <p>And if you would say that this matter applies only where there is no fear inside, but where there is fear inside, [one might think that] when he goes out and sits among people in general company it is better, come and hear: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror.” Although there is terror in the chambers, outside the sword will bereave, [so it is safer to remain indoors].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I find this hard to understand. The Gemara seems to be entertaining the possibility that it's preferable to go outside, where there is a risk to one's life, because of his mental health?

(...) וּמֵאֵימָתַי הִתְחִילוּ כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל לְחַשֵּׁב בְּחֶשְׁבּוֹן זֶה. מִסּוֹף חַכְמֵי הַגְּמָרָא בְּעֵת שֶׁחָרְבָה אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל וְלֹא נִשְׁאַר שָׁם בֵּית דִּין קָבוּעַ.‏</p>\n<p>When there is no Sanhedrin, the monthly calendar is established according to the fixed calendar that we follow now, and the sighting of the moon is of no consequence. (...) When did the entire Jewish people begin using this calendar? At the conclusion of the Talmudic period, when Eretz Yisrael was in ruin, and an established court no longer remained there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So current rabbis would only have authority to intercalate a year if they formed a new Sanhedrin and the aforementioned criteria from the Talmud would hold.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The rabbis currently do not have the authority to declare a leap year because there is no Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>The current calendar was set up by Hillel II and is completely fixed by calculation. Indeed, even though the current calendar does have an error of one day in 216 years, we cannot fix that until the Mashiach comes and a new Sanhedrin appointed.</p>\n\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://netivyah.org/the-hillel-ii-calendar-and-double-torah-portions/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">can see</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a remedy, the Sanhedrin instituted the Hillel II calendar in 4119 AM -359 CE.\n  In one sense it preserved uniformity among Jewish people\n  abroad, but in another way it severed ties between Israel and the\n  Diaspora.</p>\n  \n  <p>The calendar itself, in general, is quite accurate, averaging 29.5\n  days per month and 365.2468 days per year (compared to the average\n  solar year length of 365.2422). It allows for adding and subtracting a\n  day in consecutive years as needed, so as to avoid waving the lulav on\n  Shabbat, or landing Yom Kippur adjacent to a Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>Implementing the Hillel II calendar was the Sanhedrin’s last big\n  decision before disbanding. Whenever the Hillel II calendar will be\n  decommissioned in the future to return to sighting and declaring the\n  New Moon days, it would have to be at the authority of a reconvened\n  Sanhedrin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does God owe us anything?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a question I've been wondering about for a few years. I've not been having an easy time in life, and that's why I have started asking this question. I'm sort of waiting for a \"salvation\", but according to the normal course of events and the current trajectory I'm on, things won't change unless there is some salvation. </p>\n\n<p>Now although the question is comes from an emotional place, the question itself is very logical. If God were to 'owe' us a base level of things which would make a normal person happy, it would follow that I can expect that from him. If not, I'd assume I'd need to adjust my expectations accordingly so I don't keep getting let down when things don't go the way I want, and I'd also adjust my lifestyle accordingly to adapt for this.</p>\n\n<p>Would love sources for this if possible as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Reward and punishment is a basic belief of Judaism. If someone does the right things, he is owed their reward.</p>\n<p>The question is if the reward will be given, or if there can be any expectation of receiving it, in this world. The answer for the most part seems to be no; it depends on pre-determined mazal and other factors.</p>\n<p>The Gemara Moed Katan 28A says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבא חיי בני ומזוני לא בזכותא תליא מילתא אלא במזלא תליא מילתא דהא רבה ורב חסדא תרוייהו רבנן צדיקי הוו מר מצלי ואתי מיטרא ומר מצלי ואתי\nמיטרא</p>\n<p>Rava said: Length of life, children, and sustenance do not\ndepend on one’s merit, but rather they depend upon fate. As, Rabba and\nRav Ḥisda were both pious Sages; one Sage would pray during a drought\nand rain would fall, and the other Sage would pray and rain would\nfall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even so the Gemara continues</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רב חסדא חיה תשעין ותרתין שנין רבה חיה ארבעין בי רב חסדא שיתין הלולי בי\nרבה שיתין תיכלי בי רב חסדא סמידא לכלבי ולא מתבעי בי רבה נהמא דשערי\nלאינשי ולא משתכח</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, their lives were very different. Rav Ḥisda lived for\nninety-two years, whereas Rabba lived for only forty years. The house\nof Rav Ḥisda celebrated sixty wedding feasts, whereas the house of\nRabba experienced sixty calamities.  In the house of Rav Ḥisda there\nwas bread from the finest flour [semida] even for the dogs, and it was\nnot asked after, as there was so much food. In the house of Rabba, on\nthe other hand, there was coarse barley bread even for people, and it\nwas not found in sufficient quantities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This shows that the length of life, children, and sustenance all depend not upon one’s merit, but upon fate.</p>\n<p>Tosfos says that with great merit one can change his mazal/fate but apparently there can be no <em>expectation</em> of doing so because Rabba was certainly a person of great merit</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Torah says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you follow My statutes and observe My commandments and perform them, I will give your rains in their time, the land will yield its produce, and the tree of the field will give forth its fruit… \n  You will eat your food to satiety, and you will live in security in your land. \n  And I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down with no one to frighten [you]. \n  I will remove wild beasts from the land, and no army will pass through your land…\n  I will make you fruitful and increase you…\n  And I will place My dwelling in your midst… I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people. \n  I am the Lord, your God, Who took you out of the land of Egypt, from being slaves to them, and I broke the pegs of your yoke and led you upright. [Lev 26:3-13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the path is clear.  A promise by God is something God owes us, <em>if</em> we do our part.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question is a bit confusing. What does it mean for G-d to \"owe\" us something?\nThis can be addressed in a few different ways:</p>\n\n<p>1) There's a medrash Rabbah (in Vayikra, I don't remember exactly where) which discusses how any mitzvah we do is only after we received from G-d.\ni.e.- you can only put a mezuzah on a house after G-d gave you the house.\nYou can make a bracha on food only after G-d gave you the food to eat. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, G-d can't owe us anything. All that we do is try to use those things which G-d has already given us and show that we're using it the best that we can.</p>\n\n<p>It's comparable to a worker who has a credit card, paid for by his company, for business expenses. \nIf one day they decide to stop paying for the card, he can't claim \"You owe me to continue paying for the card. See, each month I've fully detailed expenses and everything has been for the sake of the company!\"\nThat claim is irrelevant. The fact that he has faithfully used the card in the past only justifies why they have paid in the past. But that in no way creates an obligation regarding the future.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, no matter how righteous we have been and how well we have used the resources granted to us, that only justifies G-d's giving to us in the past.\nWe can't claim \"you owe us for the future\" as well. Why should G-d owe us?</p>\n\n<p>2) There's a famous question asked, whose answer is relevant to you.\nIn the desert, the Jewish people received 3 special gifts- the \"mann\" (heavenly sustanence), the well which supplied water, and the clouds of glory.\nOf all three, we only commemorate the clouds of glory with a holiday- sukkos.\nWhy don't we commemorate the mann and the well?</p>\n\n<p>Some commentators explain (I believe I saw this in the bnei yissachar, and I saw it quoted in the name of the Chida and Ohr HaChayim though I don't know where) Hashem \"owed\" the Jewish people mann and the well.\nAfter all, he took us out to the desert. Since he took us from mitzraim (Egypt) and brought us to a place without food, he was obligated to sustain us. It's simple justice- you need to sustain those who are dependent on you.\nBut the clouds of glory- that was a special miracle which didn't have to occur. We could have survived without it. Since it wasn't necessary, and G-d gave it to us anyway, it deserves special recognition.</p>\n\n<p>According to this, there is room to say that G-d \"owes\" us the minimum we need to survive. Of course, this doesn't help us much practically.\nFirst, we don't know what is the minimum- maybe we've already received it,\nSecond, perhaps we've done sins which have made us unworthy.</p>\n\n<p>3) As the Ramchal explains (beginning of mesilas yesharim, also in daas tevunos and other places) Hashem created us in order to do good and benificant. That's our purpose- we're in this world to perfect ourselves and come closer to G-d (both in this world and the next.) Such closeness is the ultimate good G-d could give. But like any relationship, we develop our side of the connection through fulfilling the mitzvos, working on self-development and making ourselves worthy of being so connected.</p>\n\n<p>According to this perspective, your 2 initial points are both true.\nG-d does provide what we need. He does take care of us. \nBut, what we need (to work on self perfection and to fulfill our purpose in this world and obtain the ultimate good) is not the same as what we want.</p>\n\n<p>We all know of plenty of people who suffered tremendous accidents, and as a result ending up accomplishing much more after they became handicapped than they ever would have had they stayed healthy.\nIf you'd ask them initially, they would have said that potential growth isn't worth the suffering.\nBut after they grew from the challenge, they almost always acknowledge that without the accident and the disability they never would have accomplished as much as they did.</p>\n\n<p>According to this point, the question of G-d owing is irrelevant. Even if He does owe us, since he created us (as per #2 above) he would only owe use what would bring us to the ultimate good- which might be very different than what we think He owes us.</p>\n\n<p>in short- no matter which perspective you choose, G-d doesn't owe us anything specific that I could demand, or get upset if I didn't receive it.</p>\n\n\n",

Combined with other opinions I will record the conclusions of my father the Rosh of blessed memory. According to the rabbi’s order, I have order my present writings here, save for several items.</p>\n\n<p>א\"ר יצחק בריה דרב יהודה לעולם יבקש אדם שלא יחלה שאם חלה אומרים לו הבא זכות ותפטר וכיון שחלה האדם מצוה על כל אדם לבקרו שכן מצינו בהקב\"ה שמבקר חולים</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yitzchak son of Rav Yehuda says: One should request of God that his friend shall not fall ill, for if he does fall ill, his merits will become used up in order to remove the illness. Once a person becomes sick it is a mitzvah on every individual to go and visit the sick. This is what is found by God Himself. </p>\n\n<p>כמו שדרשו בפסוק וירא אליו ה' באלוני ממרא מלמד שבא אליו לבקר החולה וסמכוה אקרא והודעת להם את הדרך ילכו בה ומצוה גדולה היא לבקר שמתוך כך יבקש עליו רחמים ונמצא כאילו מחיה אותו וגם מתוך שרואהו מעיין בענינו אם יצטרך לשום דבר משתדל בו \nלהמציאו לו ועושה שיכבדו וירבצו לפניו</p>\n\n<p>In the verse “And God appeared to him in the plains of Mamre” the rabbis taught that this means that God came to visit the sick [Abraham], and the rabbis based this on the verse “And you shall inform them of the path which they shall go on”. Furthermore, it is indeed a great mitzvah to visit the sick, since through the process he will beseech God for mercy on the ill, and it is as if he resurrected him into life. By seeing the patient alone he will be able to see if he needs anything to be taken care of, including cleaning and washing.</p>\n\n<p>והקרובים נכנסין מיד לבקרו והרחוקים אחר ג' ימים והחברים כקרובים ואם קפץ עליו החולי אלו ואלו נכנסין מיד ואפי' הגדול ילך לבקר הקטן ואפילו כמה פעמים ביום ואפי' בן גילו שנוטל א' מס' בחליו וכל המוסיף הרי זה משובח ובלבד שלא יטריח לו ולא ישב ע\"ג מטה ולא ע\"ג כסא ולא על ספסל אלא מתעטף ויושב לפניו שהשכינה למעלה מראשותיו של חולה שנאמר ה' יסעדנו על ערש דוי </p>\n\n<p>Close relatives visit right away, other acquaintances may visit after three days have passed. Friends have the same status as close relatives. However, if one gets sick very suddenly everyone may visit right away. A great person visits even the most insignificant of individuals, even several times per day. Even one who has certain similarities  to the patient, so much that he removes one sixtieth of the patients illness in a visit. It is indeed a praiseworthy endeavor for anyone who increases in visiting; the more the merrier! As long as one does not cause strain on the patient; likewise one should not sit on the patients bed, chair or couch. Rather one should sit at an appropriate distant, since there is a divine presence above the patients head, as the verse says “God assists him when sick in bed”.</p>\n\n<p>ואין מבקרין אותו בג' שעות ראשונות של יום מפני שכל חולה מיקל עליו חוליו בבקר ולא יחוש לבקש עליו רחמים וכן לא בג' שעות אחרונות של יום שאז מכביד עליו חוליו ויתיאש מלבקש עליו רחמים</p>\n\n<p>One may not visit the patient in the first three hours of the day, since every patient’s illness is lightened during that period of the day, the visitor will not think to pray for the patient while there. Similarly, one should not visit during the last three hours of the day, since during that period his illness increases in strength, and the visitor will give up hope and not pray for him. </p>\n\n<p>וכשמבקש עליו רחמים אם מבקש לפניו יכול לבקש בין בכל לשון בין בלשון הקדש ושלא בפניו לא יבקש אלא בלשון הקודש כשאר תפלות יחיד</p>\n\n<p>When praying for the sick, one may pray in any language, provided that he is in front of the patient. However, one not in front of the patient, one may only pray in Hebrew, like other private prayers.</p>\n\n<p>ויכלול אותו עם חולי ישראל שיאמר המקום ירחם עליך בתוך חולי ישראל ובשבת יאמר שבת היא מלזעוק ורפואה קרובה לבא ורחמיו מרובין ושבתו בשלום </p>\n\n<p>One should include this patients with the rest of those in the nation of Yisroel. One should say “May God have mercy on you, among those sick in Yisroel”. On Sabbath one says “It is Sabbath, don’t cry! Healing is coming soon, God’s mercy is abundant and His Sabbath is with peace”. </p>\n\n<p>ומזכירין אותו שיתן דעתו על עניניו דתניא משעלה אדם למטה נכנסין אצלו ואומרים לו לא דברים מחיים ולא דברים ממיתים שמא הלוית או שמא הלוך אדם או שמא הפקדת אצל בני אדם או הפקידו אצלך פי' אומרים לו שיתן דעתו על עניניו ואל יפחד מפני זה יותר מן המות. \n[...]</p>\n\n<p>אין מבקרים לא לחולי מעיים ולא לחולי העין ולא לחולי הראש חולי המעיים משום כיסופא חולי העין והראש מפני שהדבור קשה ליה הלכך כל חולי דתקיף ליה עלמא וקשה ליה דבורא אין מבקרין אותו בפניו אלא נכנסין בבית החיצון ושואלין ודורשים בו אם צריכים לכבד ולרבץ לפניו וכיוצא בו ושומעין צערו ומבקשין עליו רחמים.</p>\n\n<p>One does not visit someone with a stomach illness, eye illness or head illness. The stomach illness is on account of the am embarrassment associated with it. The eye and head illnesses are because it is difficult during that time is especially painful to hear speech. Thus, any patient who finds speech difficult may not be visited directly. Rather, one must enter the outer area and inquire of the patient’s needs, may they be washing or cleaning, and one asks about the illness and prays for him. </p>\n\n<p>מבקרין חולי נכרים מפני דרכי שלום תניא האיש משמש האיש בחולי המעיים אבל לא את האשה והאשה משמשת האשה והאיש בחולי המעיים ראובן שאסר הנאתו על שמעון וחלה שמעון יכול ליכנס לו ולבקרו </p>\n\n<p>Non-Jewish patients are visited in order to keep the peace and not differentiate. It is taught: The man tends to a man with stomach illness but not a woman. Likewise, a woman tends to a woman or a man with stomach illness. \nReuven who prohibited Shimon to benefit from him, and then Shimon falls ill, Reuven may visit him.</p>\n\n<p>ובמקום שנותנין שכר למי שישב אצל החולה לצוות לו לא ישב אצלו אלא מבקרו מעומד ואם חלה בנו של שמעון יכול ראובן ליכנס לו ולישב עמו ולבקרו אם נכסי שמעון אסורין על ראובן וחלה שמעון נכנס ראובן לבקרו מעומד אבל לא ישב חלה בנו אינו נכנס כלל אלא שואל עליו בשוק:</p>\n\n<p>A location in which those who sick by the sick or compensated, one should not sit by the patient, rather one should stay standing and visit in that way. If the son of Shimon falls ill, Rueven can sit with him to visit. If the property of Shimon are forbidden to Reuven, and Shimon falls ill, Reuven may visit him standing, but may not sit. If his son falls sick, he may not enter at all, rather he inquires of him in the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one sell chametz during a pandemic\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The halachic transfer of property between parties (<em>chaloth kinyan</em>) conventionally involves a physical exchange of a tangible object (<em>maaseh kinyan</em>).  For example, the rabbi of the synagogue I used to attend prior to the apocalypse, when acting as an agent for selling chametz, used to always have the seller sign a tangible contract authorizing his agency. In addition, the agency itself was apparently effected by a <em>kinyan chalipin</em> involving the seller acquiring the pen from the rabbi.  Considering the current crisis, is there a  universally accepted way for all parties involved to effect a halachic sale remotely, avoiding any need for direct physical contact between the parties?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As Epicentre says, there are multiple opportunities to sell Chometz online without the kinyan chalipin. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.federation.org.uk/mechiras-chometz-2020/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> from the Federation of Synagogues in the UK. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dinonline.org/selling-chametz-online/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> you have the version from din-on-line. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/sell_chometz_cdo/jewish/Sell-Your-Chametz-Online.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad</a> have a form too and say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Leading halachic authorities have ruled that online\n  authorizations are acceptable for the purpose of selling chametz.

The articles that I have seen on this do not seem to emphasize this adequately. The quote from the rabbis does not seem to adequately explain that it is only in a situation where they are indeed in <em>despair of their lives</em> and not <em>could lead them to despair of life</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the government or a physician has decided that an individual must\n  remain in isolation over the course of Yom Tov and this individual has\n  a psychological condition where physicians who know this patient have\n  determined that there is a possibility that this person being alone\n  over the course of Yom Tov would be in a situation of pikuach nefesh\n  (possible suicide) if the individual was not able to communicate or\n  speak with family members, then the family members must reach out to\n  this person over Yom Tov to speak on the phone or use the internet by\n  leaving a connection open from before Yom Tov. Rav Moshe Feinstein has\n  decided that, in certain circumstances, psychological danger is\n  considered life threatening. Rabbi Soloveitchik went further and\n  noted, in the name of his grandfather Rav Chaim Soloveitchik, that\n  even if there is a concern that someone will lose his or her mind even\n  if their life is not in danger, that too is considered a case of\n  Pikuach Nefashos.</p>\n  \n  <p>If a person is physically ill and alone and the\n  physicians have determined that there is a possibility of the\n  condition deteriorating further to a point of being life threatening,\n  then the family must remain in contact using electronic devices with\n  that person over the course of Yom Tov in order to check on the\n  person's well being.</p>\n  \n  <p>If a parent who is ill lives outside of Israel\n  and the parent has a non-Jewish aide then the children who live in\n  Israel are allowed to call the non-Jew and speak with the non-Jew when\n  it is Yom Tov outside of Israel and not Yom Tov in Israel in order to\n  check in on the parent. Those family members in Israel can also ask\n  the non-Jew to show the parent a live screen of the family so that the\n  patient can see that his family members are safe and healthy. It is\n  also proper to tell the non-Jewish aide in America that if the patient\n  is upset or concerned over Yom Tov and the patient would like to speak\n  to family members, then the non-Jew should remind the patient that it\n  is Passover or the Sabbath and that after the Sabbath and holiday is\n  over they will certainly be able to speak on the phone.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if\n  someone is not as ill as described above, however they must be\n  confined and alone because of the circumstances related to the\n  Coronavirus then they may not use any electronic devices in order to\n  connect to family members on Shabbos and Yom Tov. Although it is\n  painful and sad to be alone and people want to be with family and\n  friends, this is not a sakanas nefashos, a life threatening situation,\n  and there is no place at all to allow the violation of Shabbos and Yom\n  Tov.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Schachter explains that showing a <em>virtual</em> seder during Yom Tov is improper.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, to leave a computer screen on and to have people watch and\n  connect over the internet is a greater concern of violating Shabbos\n  and Yom Tov since it creates images and pictures when the people move.</p>\n  \n  <p>If the government and medical professionals have said that it is not\n  safe for parents and children to be together then children may not\n  visit for Pesach, even at the insistence of the parents. Not listening\n  to the parents in this situation is not a violation of Kibbud Av V’Em.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, there are other reasons to do so as well. For one, the Rambam felt that the observance of the Torah is human-oriented, not G-d-oriented since God is all-powerful and does not need to see people doing mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to Perek Chelek Maimonides writes that people only achieve immortality when they develop their minds. Thus, Maimonides stated that the purpose of the Torah is three-fold: to teach true ideas and helps improve individuals and society. People fulfill the Bible’s mandate, he stressed, when and only when they study and understand about science and the laws of nature and use their knowledge of the world to improve themselves and society. Thus, Maimonides considered it a mitzvah to study science.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides discusses many ways that a person can develop their intellect, either by studying religious books or studying science. In his Guide of the Perplexed, chapters 25 through 54, for example, he explains that the Sabbath laws help promote rest for the body and mind, contributing to good health. However, few people realize the good flowing from good human activity (as a result of observing the rabbinical enactments as the rabbis explained them). People need wise leaders to guide them. The Torah does this. </p>\n\n\n",

The term minim refers to Jewish idolaters or those who perform transgressions for the sake of angering God, even if one eats non-kosher meat for the sake of angering God or wears sha'atnez for the sake of angering God. The term apikorsim refers to Jews who deny the Torah and the concept of prophecy. If there is the possibility, one should kill them with a sword in public view. If that is not possible, one should develop a plan so that one can cause their deaths. What is implied? If one sees such a person descend to a cistern, and there is a ladder in the cistern, one should take the ladder, and excuse oneself, saying: \"I must hurry to take my son down from the roof. I shall return the ladder to you soon.\" Similarly, one should devise other analogous plans to cause the death of such people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In plain terms, it would seem that the Rambam is saying that it is a commandment, if a person is able, to kill a person with a sword, or if not to at least try to devise a plan to cause them to die, on the basis of whether they deny the divinity of the Torah and prophecy.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, there are many Jews who do not believe in this. And not just the <em>tinok shenishba</em> but there are many who were raised with these beliefs and for intellectual reasons concluded that they disbelieve in the divinity of the Torah and prophecy, sometimes even outspoken about this.</p>\n<p>The same halacha is brought down in other places, for example in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.158?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De’ah 158</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַמִּינִים, וְהֵם שֶׁעוֹבְדִים לַעֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים, אוֹ הָעוֹשֶׂה עֲבֵרוֹת לְהַכְעִיס, אֲפִלּוּ אָכַל נְבֵלוֹת אוֹ לָבַשׁ שַׁעַטְנֵז לְהַכְעִיס הֲרֵי זֶה מִין; וְהָאֶפִּיקוֹרְסִים, וְהֵם שֶׁכּוֹפְרִים בַּתּוֹרָה וּבִנְבוּאָה מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל, מִצְוָה לְהָרְגָם. אִם יֵשׁ בְּיָדוֹ כֹּחַ לְהָרְגָם בְּסַיִף, בְּפַרְהֶסְיָא, הוֹרְגוֹ. וְאִם לָאו, יָבֹא בַּעֲלִילוֹת עַד שֶׁיְּסַבֵּב הֲרִיגָתוֹ. כֵּיצַד, רָאָה אֶחָד מֵהֶם שֶׁנָּפַל לִבְאֵר וְהַסֻלָּם בַּבְּאֵר, קוֹדֵם וּמְסַלְּקוֹ וְאוֹמֵר: הֲרֵינִי טָרוּד לְהוֹרִיד בְּנִי מִן הַגַּג וְאַחְזִירֶנּוּ לְךָ, וְכַיּוֹצֵא בִּדְבָרִים אֵלּוּ. הַגָּה: וְעַיֵּן בְּחוֹשֶׁן הַמִּשְׁפָּט סִימָן תכ''ה. מְשֻׁמָּדִים שֶׁמְּשַׁמְּדִים עַצְמָם וּמְטַמְּעִים עַצְמָם בֵּין הַגּוֹיִים לַעֲבֹד עֲבוֹדָה זָרָה כְּמוֹתָם, הֲרֵי הֵם כְּמוֹ מוּמָרִים לְהַכְעִיס וּמוֹרִידִין וְלֹא מַעֲלִין.

If one has strength in his hand to kill them with a sword, in public, he should kill him. <em>Etc.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I could not find where the commentaries on those disagree either.</p>\n<p>The law would appear clear on who it's referring to, and it also appears clear to be referring to individual action and not an act of a court.</p>\n<p>And yet, I have never heard a rabbi practically advise a person to kill a heritic.

The possibilities I can conceive of are:</p>\n<p><strong>a)</strong> Rambam's (et al) opinion is indeed that we should kill such heretics, but not in our day (such as because a court is involved in some regard; alternatively, because there is no country in which this halacha could be legally followed). (If this is the case, where is this brought down, and when/under what circumstances would it be applicable?)</p>\n<p><strong>b)</strong> Rambam's (et al) opinion is indeed that we should kill such heretics, but we do not follow his opinion. (If this is the case, where is it discussed why we do not follow his opinion?)</p>\n<p><strong>c)</strong> Rambam's  (et al) opinion is that we should not kill such heretics, but rather there are other criterion (like where they actually pose a risk to life, though that would seem to be redundant as that's already covered by other laws). (If this is the case, where is it explained what he means and why he writes this halacha to appear as if he says this?)</p>\n<p>What is the explanation for such a radical-sounding law, and if it is not a practical halacha, where is it explained for the proper understanding of how it's viewed?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*As an elaboration on who qualifies as an apikores, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuva 3:7-8</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חֲמִשָּׁה הֵן הַנִּקְרָאִים מִינִים. הָאוֹמֵר שֶׁאֵין שָׁם אֱלוֹהַּ וְאֵין לָעוֹלָם מַנְהִיג. וְהָאוֹמֵר שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם מַנְהִיג אֲבָל הֵן שְׁנַיִם אוֹ יוֹתֵר. וְהָאוֹמֵר שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם רִבּוֹן אֶחָד אֲבָל שֶׁהוּא גּוּף וּבַעַל תְּמוּנָה. וְכֵן הָאוֹמֵר שֶׁאֵינוֹ לְבַדּוֹ הָרִאשׁוֹן וְצוּר לַכּל. וְכֵן הָעוֹבֵד כּוֹכָב אוֹ מַזָּל וְזוּלָתוֹ כְּדֵי לִהְיוֹת מֵלִיץ בֵּינוֹ וּבֵין רִבּוֹן הָעוֹלָמִים. כָּל אֶחָד מֵחֲמִשָּׁה אֵלּוּ הוּא מִין:</p>\n<p>שְׁלֹשָׁה הֵן הַנִּקְרָאִים אֶפִּיקוֹרְסִין. הָאוֹמֵר שֶׁאֵין שָׁם נְבוּאָה כְּלָל וְאֵין שָׁם מַדָּע שֶׁמַּגִּיעַ מֵהַבּוֹרֵא לְלֵב בְּנֵי הָאָדָם. וְהַמַּכְחִישׁ נְבוּאָתוֹ שֶׁל משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ. וְהָאוֹמֵר שֶׁאֵין הַבּוֹרֵא יוֹדֵעַ מַעֲשֵׂה בְּנֵי הָאָדָם. כָּל אֶחָד מִשְּׁלֹשָׁה אֵלּוּ הֵן אֶפִּיקוֹרוֹסִים. שְׁלֹשָׁה הֵן הַכּוֹפְרִים בַּתּוֹרָה. הָאוֹמֵר שֶׁאֵין הַתּוֹרָה מֵעִם ה' אֲפִלּוּ פָּסוּק אֶחָד אֲפִלּוּ תֵּבָה אַחַת אִם אָמַר משֶׁה אֲמָרוֹ מִפִּי עַצְמוֹ הֲרֵי זֶה כּוֹפֵר בַּתּוֹרָה. וְכֵן הַכּוֹפֵר בְּפֵרוּשָׁהּ וְהוּא תּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה וְהַמַּכְחִישׁ מַגִּידֶיהָ כְּגוֹן צָדוֹק וּבַיְתּוֹס. וְהָאוֹמֵר שֶׁהַבּוֹרֵא הֶחֱלִיף מִצְוָה זוֹ בְּמִצְוָה אַחֶרֶת וּכְבָר בָּטְלָה תּוֹרָה זוֹ אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהִיא הָיְתָה מֵעִם ה' כְּגוֹן הָהַגְרִים. כָּל אֶחָד מִשְּׁלֹשָׁה אֵלּוּ כּוֹפֵר בַּתּוֹרָה:</p>\n<p>Five individuals are described as Minim: a) one who says there is no God nor ruler of the world; b) one who accepts the concept of a ruler, but maintains that there are two or more; c) one who accepts that there is one Master [of the world], but maintains that He has a body or form; d) one who maintains that He was not the sole First Being and Creator of all existence; e) one who serves a star, constellation, or other entity so that it will serve as an intermediary between him and the eternal Lord. Each of these five individuals is a Min.</p>\n<p>Three individuals are described as Epicursim: a) one who denies the existence of prophecy and maintains that there is no knowledge communicated from God to the hearts of men; b) one who disputes the prophecy of Moses, our teacher; c) one who maintains that the Creator is not aware of the deeds of men.

Each of these three individuals is considered as one who denies the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The law would appear clear on who it's referring to, at least regarding apikorsim. Regarding minim, Rambam does speak about them sinning <em>l'hachis</em> in the halacha but not in the definition here. I've seen <em>mumar l'hachis</em> described as one who sins to anger God (as per this translation), one who sins out of spite, an intellectual (as opposed to emotional) sinner, and one who sins out of lack of faith or apathy. In any event, it is generally the alternative to one who sins out of a craving. Due to the potential confusion of who that refers to, the question in my mind can just as well be focused on apikorsim.</p>\n<p>As another footnote, it also appears clear to be referring to individual action and not an act of a court, hence me seeking insight on what else this should be understood to mean.</p>\n<p>Edit: I have been asked to clarify how this question is different from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4077/history-of-capital-punishment\">\"History of Capital Punishment\"</a> on actions of a Beis Din. The difference is that this is a particular halacha which, at least on the surface, is not about actions of a Beis Din, but rather is written in a way that appears to describe actions of an individual.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is not that a court is required; that is not the situation described here. Rather, based on Mamrim 3:2, it would appear that this is referring to a case where it became publicly known that an individual was a heretic, causing them to lose their status and, consequently, any need for a warning or judges.*</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Chazon Ish on Yoreh Deah 2:16 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gray_Matter_I%2C_Non_Orthodox_Marriages%2C_The_Halachic_Status_of_Reform_Marriages.3.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gives an explanation</a> why this law is not operative today, namely he says that it applies in a time when divine providence is evident and heretics would know that their actions lead to catastrophes. But in our day, this is not the case, and people would see the killing of heretics as destructive and not constructive, so it should not be practiced. Instead, nowadays he advises that people \"attract the masses to Torah through love\".</p>\n\n<p>He also adds that there is a proper way to rebuke them which we don't know how to do and thus \"one must treat them as transgressors under duress\" and that heretics are victims of the \"spirit of the times\" and likewise they are not necessarily regarded as heretics and sinners.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, the explanation provided for not implementing the above law is that <strong>who is regarded as a heretic requires important additional qualifiers beyond Rambam's (et al) presented definitions which would mean that there <em>are</em> no heretics and wanton sinners anymore</strong>, and additionally that the practical consequences of the law need to be taken into account.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Rambam describes that aspect in a related <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1181854/jewish/Mamrim-Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halacha in Mamrim 3</a>, where if a person denies the validity of the Oral Law consciously, according to his perception of things and after his frivolous thoughts, for example the followers of Zadok and Boethus (but not their children, who were simply raised to have the incorrect beliefs):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since it has become known that such a person denies the Oral Law, he may be pushed into a pit and may not be helped out. He is like all the rest of the heretics who say that the Torah is not Divine in origin, those who inform on their fellow Jews, and the apostates. All of these are not considered as members of the Jewish people. There is no need for witnesses, a warning, or judges for them to be executed. Instead, whoever kills them performs a great mitzvah and removes an obstacle from people at large.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>It is possible that the command to kill innocent people were not really Maimonides intentions. As you know, Maimonides was a rationalist and accepted much of the philosophy of the Greek pagan Aristotle. He accepted Greek thought, so much so, that some scholars question whether Maimonides felt, as Ralbag and Ibn Ezra did, that G-d does not know humans as individuals, thus violating his own laws.</p>\n\n<p>As you know, since Maimonides felt the need to help people (the general population) who wanted to know what Judaism required of them, he felt obligated to write the Mishneh Torah (the second Torah); to explain what was permitted and what was not (prohibited). Thus, he included, or listed and explained commands that the rabbi felt were explicit or implicit in the Torah. For example, in his code of Jewish laws, Mishneh Torah, he included the laws of sacrifices even though they were no longer applicable at his time and ours, for Maimonides felt that G-d did not need nor want sacrifices but only “allowed” them as a concession for the needs of the early times (ancient Israelites).</p>\n\n<p>For support of this view we shall refer to the Talmud and one of the first law codes ever composed.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Talmud  only sanctioned one Targum (translation of the Bible) for Jews along with the Hebrew Bible on a weekly basis. This was the famed Aramaic Bible translation called Targum Onkelos, which the Talmud called Targum didan, “our translation,” or “the authorized Targum,” which was the only targum that was ever authorized by the rabbis (See Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 3a,) and yet despite thousands of volumes of composed Midrashim, the rabbis never required Jews to read Midrashim as they did Onkelos. It seems clear that the rabbis did not take Midrashim literally but as parables designed to teach proper behavior. Maimonides agreed with this.[1]</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, Professor Lawrence H. Schiffman compared the Code of Hammurabi, one of the oldest law code ever recorded, to the Bible and made an interesting assessment. Schiffman posits that the laws of ancient people were not seen as the old expression goes ‘set in stone,’ rather they acted more like guidelines, they were never practiced on a superficial level. So, rather than practicing these seemingly harsh laws, the rabbis tell us that these laws were actually meant to wean people away from harsh cruel judgments. Historians know this process as “synchronization.” For example, the law for “an eye for an eye” was never carried out in biblical times (the Talmud, or Oral Torah, explains it to mean that people pay money in monetary compensation). The same applied to the laws of slavery, polygamy, the laws of the captive woman, and destroying cities. </p>\n\n<p>Understanding the ancient worldview of laws and the rabbis endorsement on the more rational Bible translation over imaginative Midrashim, and Rambam’s emphasis on codifying Jewish laws, helps us better understand Maimonides.</p>\n\n<p>[1] Might we say Rambam viewed some laws as he did Midrash</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Contradiction in Maimonides?",
    "content": "# Contradiction in Maimonides?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Maimonides felt that G-d is transcendent, that G-d has no body and is one, though we cannot attribute any description to G-d. At best, we can say what G-d is not. Thus it is impossible to describe G-d with language. Thus, Maimonides was clear that we can only refer to G-d with silence.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The most apt phrase concerning this subject is the dictum occurring\n  in the Psalms, Silence is praise to Thee (Ps. 65:2), which interpreted\n  signifies: silence with regard to You is praise.\" (Guide, 1:59)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to praising G-d with silence, Maimonides writes that all we can say is what G-d is not: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Know that description of G-d, may He be cherished and exalted, by\n  means of negation is the correct description—a description that is not\n  affected by an indulgence in facile language and does not imply any\n  deficiency with respect to G-d in general or in any particular mode.\n  On the other hand, if one describes him by means of affirmations, one\n  implies, as we have made clear, that he is associated with that which\n  is not He and implies a deficiency in Him.\" (Guide, 1:58)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, to describe G-d diminishes His stature, if not insulting. For describing G-puts G-d into a category. If we say, for example, that G-d is good, then we are placing G-d in a category of good people. This seems to contradict what the Bible teaches, that G-d is merciful, gracious, good, etc. But the Bible focused on the uniqueness of G-d, not necessarily on His oneness. For example, some scholars feel that the words in the Shema \"G-d is “one,\" may refer to the unique characteristics of G-d, a G-d separated (holy) from nature. For many ancient cultures held the belief that there was one creator, even the ancient Egyptians believed at one point in a monotheistic religion, for example, the Sun-disc god called Aton (represented by the sun because the Egyptians felt that there was one sun). However, the Egyptians were still an idolatrous culture and their god (or, gods) were still subject to nature. In any event, the Bible's revolution did not focus on monotheism per se but that G-d’s “oneness” is unique.</p>\n\n<p>In the Guide, Maimonised used metaphysical proofs in what he called the doctrine of negative attributes (beginning of part 2 of the Guide) to prove G-d's oneness. G-d is not an impossible existence nor possible, G-d is a necessity. An ultimate source that prompts, for example, the motions of the spheres. G-d is an absolute unity and from this, we can infer His existence. G-d is not “a kind that encompasses many other single particulars,” nor “a body that is divided into many parts and extremities.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This G-d is one; He is neither two nor more than two; He is simply\n  one.\" (MT, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah, 1:7)[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The term “one” here denotes nothing in this world that we can refer. Which is to say, anything we can call or attribute to \"oneness\" in the material world is only a designation of a singularity. Any physical object can ultimately be divided into elements that make up a single object in question and can be divided further into chance motion atoms bouncing around which makes the illusion of \"oneness.\" It is merely a linguistic device. Maimonides explains,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If the Creator had a body, He would have a defined form for it is\n  impossible that there should be a body that is not defined. And\n  anything that is defined is limited in its power.\" (MT, Hilkhot Yesodei\n  HaTorah, 1:7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since G-d is not made up of atoms, it follows that only G-d can be described as \"one.\" A unitary. Because G-d’s unity is not dependent on material things, G-d is infinite and immaterial, incorporeal. For if G-d were many (multiplicity) it would require form which can be distinguished (though physical characteristics).</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides writes,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If G-d were many, He would have a body and physicality, because items\n  that are co-extensive with each other cannot be counted as distinct\n  from one another except through occurrences that happen to their\n  bodies.\" (MT, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah, 1:7)[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, it is impossible to apply the term “one” to anything else other than G-d. For only G-d is truly “one.” This is explicit in the opening chapter of Mishneh Torah. However, in the Guide Maimonides explicitly explains the “Doctrine of Negative Attributes” which effectively prohibits any kind of verbal description to G-d, making it is impossible to characterize G-d. </p>\n\n<p>So, which one is it? Can we describe G-d as \"one\" and yet say it is impossible to describe G-d with any kind of language?</p>\n\n<p>[1] For example, Maimonides criticized Christianity because what bothered him the most was the notion that there are three gods. He felt strongly that this is philosophically impossible.</p>\n\n<p>[2] See also Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah, 3; see also Guide, 2:1: “it is impossible that He should be two or more, because of the impossibility of a multitude of separate things that have no physical form.”</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rambam explicitly states in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 1:65 that God's oneness is <em>not</em> an attribute:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AFTER YOU have advanced thus far, and truly comprehended that God exists without having the attribute of existence, and that He is One, without having the attribute of unity,</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp075.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 1:58 he explains that things which seem to be be positive attributes of God are in fact not:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It has thus been shown that every attribute predicated of God either denotes the quality of an action, or - when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself, and not of His actions – the negation of the opposite.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp068.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, he explains how this applies specifically to oneness in the immediately preceding sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We thus learn that there is no other being like unto God, and we say that He is One, i.e., there are not more Gods than one.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp068.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, when we say that God is one, we do not mean that God has a positive attribute of oneness; we mean that God is not not-one.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/maimonides-conception-of-god/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides’ Conception of God</a> attempts to go into some detail about this. The point is that there is no way that a human being can conceive of <em>something</em> that is outside the bounds of the physical universe in which we exist. Anything that we can think of must be within the limits of what our minds can conceive of. An abstract analogy would be similar to attempting to visualize a tesseract (an expansion of a cube into four dimensions). Because we are unable to perceive more than three physical dimensions, we are therefore unable to describe (other than with theoretical mathematics) anything that extends into other dimensions. This shows that we cannot describe in terms that our finite minds can comprehend something that is outside of what our minds can deal with.</p>\n\n<p>Thus when we say that Hashem is <em>one</em> we are attempting to put into a term that we can use something that is basically unknowable. Rambam uses that term to point to the unknowable because he has to do something. This term is the closest he can get within human statements. Everything else that he says is <em>not</em> is to point out that even the term <em>one</em> is an approximation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That also means that, in Aristotelian terms, one cannot actually say\n  “God is . . .” and proceed to enumerate God’s attributes. To describe\n  the Eternal One in such a sentence is to admit of a division between\n  subject and predicate, in other words, a plurality. (Maimonides writes\n  in Chapter 50 of the Guide, “Those who believe that God is One and\n  that He has many attributes declare the Unity with their lips and\n  assume the plurality in their thoughts.”) Therefore, he concludes, one\n  cannot discuss God in terms of positive attributes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Any basis in Jewish tradition of crossing oneself as in the Christian 'sign of the cross' hand gesture?",
    "content": "# Any basis in Jewish tradition of crossing oneself as in the Christian 'sign of the cross' hand gesture?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there any Jewish tradition of crossing oneself as in the Christian 'sign of the cross' hand gesture? </p>\n\n<p>I'm aware of a crossover between Jewish tradition and other mystical traditions which involves this, called the \"Kabbalistic Cross\". That seems to be of medieval Hermetic origin, and in my reading of history it seems like sometimes wires get crossed in mysticism between Jewish, Greco-Egyptian/Hermetic, and other syncretic ideas. I wonder if there is some Jewish basis for this though as I recall seeing a Jewish mystic in Israel performing that sign and was surprised, but I did not confirm or pursue it further at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I could see some basis for this in Kabbalah as that purely Jewish tradition has historically recognized the 4 elements. Related, the \"Kabbalistic Cross\" (whether a mystical Jewish or Hermetic practice) can be understood as corresponding with 4 important points of the Hebrew Tree of Life. It includes the prayer \"Atah, Malkuth, Ve Geburah, Ve Gedulah, Le Olam Amen\" while performing hand gestures similar to the sign of the cross. The words and hand gestures pointing to different parts of the body correspond with different parts of the Hebrew Tree of Life (Atah = Keter; Malkuth = Malkuth; ve Geburah = Geburah; ve Gedulah = Chesed; Le Olam Amen) and the related 4/5 classical elements that are expressed in the Tree of Life. I bring that up to note some Hebrew connection to a 'sign of the cross'-like exercise, but on the other hand, the words in that particular prayer are the last lines of The Lord's Prayer which is of Christian origin. Again this may just be an example of \"wires get crossed in mysticism between Jewish, Greco-Egyptian/Hermetic, and other syncretic ideas\", though if that particular prayer (the Lord's Prayer) was taught by Jesus, a Jew, to his disciples, maybe to Jesus this was considered a prayer for Jewish context.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any basis for hand gesturing in a cross (raising a hand over head then touching one's forehead, chest, one shoulder then the other) in Jewish mystical tradition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The LBRP has Hebrew words and Jewish inspired divine names, even those parts recited in English at the end. That being said- none of it, including the “kabbalistic cross”, the words, gestures, any act of crossing, are Jewish and never have been. I’m assuming the act of crossing during the LBRP is a mesh of faux Jewish theology with Catholicism, or the invention of medieval Christian kabbalists- not Jewish kabbalists. “Attah malkuth vegeburah vgedulah leolam amen” isn’t a Jewish sourced combination of Hebrew words. </p>\n\n<p>The gestures used to reflect the Kabbalistic Tree of Life are inconsistent with Jewish Kabbalah. For example in Jewish Kabbalah, gevurah is associated with the left, not right, and chessed is never called gedulah nor is chessed associated with the left. The groin area where malchut is vibrated is not associated with malchut, the groin represents yesod (foundation). </p>\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, the invocation of the archangels at the end of the LBRP is a Jewish sourced prayer, said nightly before going to sleep with the bedtime Shema in some prayer books. It’s never said with arms out, as the LBRP would suggest. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּשֵׁם הַשֵּׁם אֱלֹקי יִשְׂרָאֵל, מִימִינִי מִיכָאֵל, וּמִשְּׂמֹאלִי גַּבְרִיאֵל, וּמִלְּפָנַי אוּרִיאֵל, וּמֵאֲחוֹרַי רְפָאֵל, וְעַל רֹאשִׁי שְׁכִינַת קאֵ-ל In the name of the L-rd, the G-d of Israel, may Michael be at my right hand; Gabriel at my left; before me, Uriel; behind me, Raphael; and above my head the divine presence of G-d. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jews in general are forbidden to pray or act in ways that reflect the non-Jewish world.  Among other places, this is taken from parshas Vayikra 18:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כְּמַעֲשֵׂ֧ה אֶֽרֶץ־מִצְרַ֛יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְשַׁבְתֶּם־בָּ֖הּ לֹ֣א תַעֲשׂ֑וּ וּכְמַעֲשֵׂ֣ה אֶֽרֶץ־כְּנַ֡עַן אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲנִי֩ מֵבִ֨יא אֶתְכֶ֥ם שָׁ֙מָּה֙ לֹ֣א תַעֲשׂ֔וּ וּבְחֻקֹּתֵיהֶ֖ם לֹ֥א תֵלֵֽכוּ׃\n  You shall not copy the practices of the land of Egypt where you dwelt, or of the land of Canaan to which I am taking you; nor shall you follow their laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Initially to steer Jews away from the paganism that was popular in those times, it’s been grafted to mean the non-Jewish world including Christians and Muslims, new age, or any non-Jewish religious practice (monotheistic or not). Crossing is not a Jewish concept, and appears nowhere in the written or oral Torah. Devout Jews are also careful not to even read religious material from non-Jewish sources, since this is included in “their ways”.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, it would also be forbidden for a Jew to do the LBRP. Although it uses Hebrew and divine names, it’s incorporated into hermectic and Golden Dawn beliefs, which is 100%, undoubtedly pagan. Also, for a Jew to do this, especially publicly, it appears as a sin (mar’it ayin) to the onlooker (you), and is thus treated as one. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, using the divine names in the LBRP is taking Hashems name in vein, since those names are being said outside the context of traditional Jewish prayer and learning Torah. To a Jew, using G-d and divine names to justify paganism/hermetic agendas is a gravely disrespectful and abominable practice in the eyes of G-d, for Jews and non-Jews, as is all magic. </p>\n\n\n",

So you could kasher the whole pot with hagalah, and then (after emptying the water) doing libun kal on the lip of the pot.\nHold the pot upside down over a burner. Slowly rotate the pot back and forth. You don't want to have one section for too long over the fire, because it can ruin the pot. But you want the pot lip to slowly get heated up. (I've found that doing a third of the pot lip at a time is practical. You can rotate enough so it's not too much in the fire, yet it's a small enough area that it doesn't cool down too much.)</p>\n\n<p>While you have the pot over the fire, put a piece of tissue on the inside of the pot opposite the fire. When the tissue starts to catch on fire (turning brown is good enough- it doesn't need to burst into flames) then you know that section is done.</p>\n\n<p>3) I found this works very well: take a short section of thick metal pipe (not thin aluminum). Stick a metal hanger through it, then bend the hanger back and attach the ends together. You'll end up with a handle to hold the hanger, and the piece of metal rolling freely around the middle of the hanger.</p>\n\n<p>Then you take the piece of metal, hold it over a fire until it's super hot, and you can use it as a hot stone. You can roll it over the edges of the pot while pouring boiling water over it. This also works well for counters etc. Every 15-30 seconds you stick it back over the fire to get hot again. It's very easy and pretty safe.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>After looking into the question more, it seems the poskim at <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2013/02/25/kashering-for-pesach/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dinonline</a> allows this alternative to hot bricks/stones:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can also pour boiling water (from a kettle or hot water heater)\n  into the center of the pot and have the water spill over the edges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though I don't know if other kashrus agencies disagree since the major agencies I've read thus far don't mention this alternative.

(He may mean that the transitions from the Tannaim to the Amoraim, and from the Rishonim to the Acharonim, are similarly associated with codifications of the basics of Torah Shebaal Peh, such that less effort was needed to memorize the basics. He might also be alluding to the invention of printing at the close of the era of the Rishonim, which put many more sefarim within reach of Torah scholars and sages, but at the same time reduced the amount of effort needed to learn those sefarim. One wonders, in that case, what he'd make of the explosion of Torah knowledge available on the Internet!)</p>\n\n\n",

All other breaking points are entirely customary.</p>\n<p>Historically some communities read sequentially to finish the Torah every 3 or so years, and others read to finish every year. The latter one is the widespread custom nowadays.</p>\n<p>Most people don't realize this, but there were dozens of different customs medieval  communities had for how to split the Torah up to finish it each year (this isn't the place to list them all, but <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/112106/759\">here's but one relatively famous one</a>). We have records of some communities switching to different practices for various reasons. Most of these are no longer practiced, but there are still a few different customs out there nowadays. None is halakhically fundamentally better than any other; they are just different customs. There is no, as you say, \"universal cycle\". This is surprising to many, but is explicit in Rishonim. The Rosh famously said (Chazeh HaTenufah 54):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חילוק הסדרים וחיבוריהם הוא כדי שתעלה קריאת כל התורה בשנה אחת ולכן כל חכם בעירו או בארצו חיבר והפריד הסדרים כפי הסדר שראה שהוא הנאות ואין הסדור ההוא הלכה קבועה רק מנהג ואינו חובה  </p>\n<p>The division of the sections and their combinations are in order that the whole Torah will be read in one year, therefore every wise man in his city or his country joined and divided the sections according to the order he saw fit, and this order is not a fixed law but a custom and is not obligatory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this perspective, which was probably well understood by anyone who lived among such varied practices, Or Zarua (2:45) records that when someone in his synagogue prevented the community from praying together one Shabbat and reading Emor, they should read Emor with Behar the next week because the goal is to read the whole Torah each year and it doesn't really matter how you split and double things up. It's no different from some other town's custom or from when a regular Shabbat reading is superseded by a holiday. This was followed as well by Mahari Weill to read Naso with Beha'alotkha after the community was shut down temporarily by the local Christians. This ruling was summarized in a much more popular halakhic work at the time, the Aguda, briefly as follows: if on Shabbat they were unable to [perform the] regular service and they didn't read the section, they should read the section the next week [making] two sections.</p>\n<p>Maharam Mintz (85) was later asked about a somewhat similar case where two members of the community fought for hours about which deserved the final Aliya of Vayakhel-Pekudei. They fought for so long that most everyone else left and finished the reading in a different building. The question was the next week if the main synagogue needs to reread Vayakhel and Pekudei along with Vayikra in accordance with the ruling of the Or Zarua because there was an interruption before the members finished up elsewhere. He rules that there is no issue of interruption and that moreover the Aguda explicitly said \"two sections\", which [apparently] implies not three sections, so reading Vayakhel-Pekudei-Vayikra would be too much. Additionally he suggests that it would be impossible here because these sections are in different books and the custom is to say \"Chazak\" after a book and to join the multiple sections in one overlap Aliyah.</p>\n<p>These arguments are unprecedented and are being used to buttress an essentially obvious conclusion that the whole synagogue doesn't need to read two whole sections again for two rich guys who caused a fuss. It's also readily apparent from his wording that Maharam Mintz was only working with the summary in the Aguda because the Or Zarua himself says nothing about reading only two sections (this is noted already by Zikhron Yehonatan OC 2). It's true that ordinarily there's no need to triple up on sections to make the calendar work, but the whole argument of the Or Zarua is that any breaks are fine as long as you finish on time, while Maharam appears to think there are specific sections assigned (by whom?) to each week. Additionally, we know the Kohein Gadol could read from two books at once (Yoma 70) and the Tosefta (Megilla 3) says that one can read from the end of one book to the beginning of the next as long as you have 7 readers in at least one book. Finally it's hard to believe Maharam really intended his argument to stand on its own since the practice of saying \"Chazak\" and having an overlap Aliya are clearly just customs whose absence wouldn't invalidate the reading.</p>\n<p>While Maharil ruled against reading missed sections lest someone get confused about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/112106/759\">when the next Yom Tov is</a>, and we can imagine other Rishonim who didn't comment may have felt messing with your regularly scheduled breaks isn't worth it, Rama (OC 135:2) rules like Or Zarua that it is worth messing with your regularly scheduled breaks to still manage to read it all annually.</p>\n<p>Some Acharonim quote Maharam Mintz's restrictions approvingly (Magen Avraham, Keneset Hagedolah, Olat Tamid, Noda Bihuda, Ateret Zekeinim, Shulchan Atzei Shittim, Maseit Moshe, Chokhmat Shelomo, Solet Belula, Shaarei Ephraim) but most rejected his novel position (Haghot Minhagim, Eliya Rabba, Bigdei Yesha, Beit David, Shathilei Zeithim, Maharam Shik, Chida, Matteh Yehuda, R' Nathan Adler, Peri Chadash, Devar Moshe, Ikkarei Hadat, Shulchan Hatahor, Noheig Katzon Yosef, Emet Leyaakov, R' Yehuda Miller, Birkhot Mayim, Zikhron Yehonatan, Yerekh Yaakov, Zekhor Leavraham, Hillel Omer, Betzel Hachokhma, Arukh Hashulchan). Notably, nearly all the authorities here who wrote about actual cases where Maharam's opinion would matter are in the latter group.</p>\n<p>For our case, it's important to note the opinion of the Sha'arei Ephraim (who himself accepted Maharam Mintz's position) that Rama's ruling only applies when the community prayed together and became obligated to read Torah but had to disband before reading it; only then is there a latent obligation to deal with the next week. This is a novel theoretical position perhaps based along with Maharam in a notion that each week has an assigned (by whom?) section to be read, but historically it doesn't seem to have been followed as most cases in the literature of this law being invoked are clearly where the synagogue was closed entirely that week, generally because of persecution or extreme weather (Mahari Weill, Noda Bihuda, R' Yehuda Miller, Zekhor Leavraham, Breikhot Mayim, Hillel Omer, Yerekh Yaakov above, as well as Leket Yosher, R' Chaim Palagi, Chida, Shevut Yaakov, Mekor Yisrael, Mattat Yad and Teshurat Shai; even in the Or Zarua's original case they didn't pray together). I don't know of a single actual case historically where a rabbi ruled for an actual community like the Sha'arei Ephraim; maybe someone here does and can comment, but it is certainly a minority if not solitary opinion that wasn't quoted by any later major codifiers (not even treatises, like Mishna Berura, that regularly quote the Sha'arei Ephraim). Notably, the Sha'arei Ephraim and many others admit that even if not obligated to, one could choose to read all the missed weeks' sections since we can add Aliyot on Shabbat. Thus even if you view this dispute as a full blown doubt, there is probably a way out.</p>\n<p>(A few small notes. 1) All this discussion surrounds communities. Individuals who miss Torah reading are generally assumed to not be obligated to find a way to hear it. Whether one synagogue being open in the country somewhere counts to make everyone else in the category of exempt individuals seems highly unlikely, though it's hard to prove it. How to account for every different minyan in a city is difficult. 2) The Vilna Gaon alludes to the laws of Tashlumin for prayer in regards this rule leading some later authorities to posit a third position here that one can only make up the most recent weeks' worth of sections and only if they were missed by accident and by reading the newer section first, all like Tashlumin for prayer. This would be a brand new position with no source and is contradicted by his own practice reading sections from four weeks to catch up after being released from prison. Interesting conceptually and food for an entire Shiur, but difficult to do anything with practically. 3) The special readings of the \"Four Parshiyot\" do not follow these rules since they don't fit the Or Zarua's logic. Some believe they can be made up when still thematically appropriate to the calendar.)</p>\n<p>Clearly the main position here (by any standard: historically speaking, simplest logic, majority of early opinions, majority of later opinions, majority of implemented cases) is like the Or Zarua said that this is all a custom so you can read as much as you want. And having every community finish the Torah every year is obviously a positive value. But by the same token since it's just a custom, when extremely burdensome to a community one could imagine (as did Zera Emet 3:14 regarding a town that lacked a qualified Torah reader for months) skipping out on the custom to finish the Torah one year, whether because of Kavod Haberiyot or because בזה לא נהגו the custom was never meant to include such extreme situations (the minority opinions of Maharam and Shaarei Ephraim could be offered as snifim lehakel in such circumstances). Every community needs to figure out what is feasible for them while keeping everyone safe, whether that'll be reading everything, reading just what's in the current book, reading just the last two, reading them all just at one early minyan for a small representative sub-tzibbur (since this is a communal obligation, not an individual one), or perhaps reading the missed sections outside the regular service over a few weeks as a token symbolic gesture towards how much we missed our Torah scrolls. (Remember too that an extra few hours once in the next month is still significantly less than the amount of time you would have spent in shul the last few months.)</p>\n<p>What is abundantly clear if you read all the above sources inside is the love and desire these sages and communities felt about hearing all the Torah readings, the lengths they went to try to accomplish that and the dismay they felt when unable to. Any ruling on this question must be rooted in that perspective and then work to deal with the challenges in any given community. To just say \"there are some doubts here since this is a rare question so better to just do nothing\" is not the way any of the above sages approached this question, with each lengthy responsum after the next showing how much its author cared about figuring out what to do for his community in his case. It's possible many Jews this year will be forced to not take part in this time-honored and beloved practice of reading the whole Torah each year, like many other beautiful Jewish practices which have been skipped or minimized this year, not because the imperative never existed but because in Judaism saving lives is obviously more important.</p>\n\n\n",

This is a matter of ruchnius rather than explicit physical protection. This ליל שימורים prevents the mazikim (spiritual enemies) from causing harm. One example is the four cups as normally an even number of cups allows the <em>mazikim</em> to cause harm. One of the answers is that this night we do not have to worry about this.

    "content": "# Selling chametz before burning it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During a <em>shiur</em>, I heard the Dayan of the Chasam Sofer first sold his chametz, and then bought chametz to burn. Why would someone specifically sell their chametz before biur chametz?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The whole point of selling the chametz began when the Jews moved to Poland and started having a lot of whiskey in their barrels because they were running the inns. Up until that time, people would be able to go to the local market and sell the small amount that was left. Once the large amounts of whiskey started to accumulate, and the local nobleman and the local peasnatry who might have bought it could not be trusted to not drink it all up and never pay what they owed, people would sell it, keep it sealed in the basement and then buy it back after Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>However, selling the chametz and then buying it back shows that the chametz has value. The mitzvah of <em>tashbisu</em> on the other hand requires showing that the chametz is valueless as expressed in the <em>bitul</em> of the chametz. The statement of the Chasam Sofer below explains this concept. Thus selling the chametz (as done by the Dayan of the Chasam Sofer) will allow a person to avoid the <em>isur</em> of owning chametz. However, it would not fulfill the positive mitzvah of destruction and showing that it is vvalueless. The Dayan of the Chasam Sofer was ensuring that both aspects of this were demonstrated explicitly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.baishavaad.org/bake-sale-can-a-transfer-of-ownership-effect-biur-chametz/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bake Sale: Can a Transfer of Ownership Effect Biur Chametz?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Chachamim in the\n  Mishna (Pesachim 21a) whether the mitzva of tashbisu s’or mibataichem\n  requires burning, or if crumbling chametz and dispersing it in the\n  wind or tossing it into the sea suffices. The basic Halacha follows\n  the view of the Chachamim that any means of destruction is valid,\n  although the minhag is that fire is preferred. (For this reason, when\n  Erev Pesach falls on Shabbos, we flush chametz down the toilet.)\n  Wouldn’t a sale to a gentile also fulfill the mitzva?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Minchas Chinuch (9) famously ponders whether one who owns no\n  chametz must acquire some in order to destroy it on Erev Pesach. Does\n  tashbisu require an act of elimination, or simply that one not possess\n  chametz? He concludes that the Torah mandates an act of hashbasa.</p>\n  \n  <p>But does hashbasa require physical elimination, or would a legal act\n  that removes the chametz from its owner’s possession be effective?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rishonim say that one could fulfill the mitzva of tashbisu with\n  bitul. And they say—with the notable exception of the Ran—that bitul\n  means making one’s chametz ownerless.</p>\n  \n  <p>So if bitul, wherein the chametz is untouched but its ownership is\n  changed, constitutes tashbisu, why wouldn’t selling it to a gentile\n  qualify as well?</p>\n  \n  <p>It would appear that the answer is this: Tashbisu requires that one\n  treat his chametz as worthless, something he no longer values. (See,\n  for example, the bitul formula, in which we declare that our chametz\n  “should be batel and be ownerless like the dust of the earth.”) Both\n  physically destroying chametz and relinquishing ownership of it via\n  pronouncement demonstrate that the chametz no longer holds value for\n  its owner. But selling would indicate the opposite. Offering an item\n  for sale shows that the seller values it and expects that others will\n  do so as well. He sells his chametz to exchange it for another\n  valuable commodity, money. One who sells his chametz certainly won’t\n  violate bal yeira’eh uval yimatzai, because he no longer owns it. But\n  neither will he fulfill tashbisu if it requires an eliminative act.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rashash (Pesachim 21b) suggests that one could fulfill tashbisu on\n  Erev Pesach by eating chametz and letting his gastric juices consume\n  it. But we don’t find that option mentioned by the Rishonim and\n  Acharonim, and this could be the reason: Eating something does not\n  demonstrate that one doesn’t value it, it does the inverse.</p>\n  \n  <p>A similar argument is made by the Chasam Sofer. The Tosefta (Pesachim\n  2:12) discusses the case of a man who finds himself on a ship before\n  Pesach in possession of chametz. Were he to destroy his chametz\n  provisions, he would starve before reaching land. The Tosefta says he\n  should sell or gift it to a gentile passenger, but it adds the caveat\n  (per the text of the Geonim) that one must not engage in pretense; the\n  sale must be real. The Tevu’os Shor (Bechor Shor, Pesachim 21a) offers\n  a novel understanding of contemporary mechiras chametz: It is indeed\n  ha’arama, a pretense, but because bitul eliminates the possibility of\n  Biblical violation (Pesachim 4b, 10a), the prohibition of chametz is\n  only mideRabbanan, and a ha’arama-based sale is sufficient on the\n  deRabbanan level as a reinforcement of one’s bitul. The Chasam Sofer\n  rejects this understanding, arguing, as above, that the sentiment that\n  underlies sale is the opposite of that behind bitul: Bitul means I\n  don’t value the chametz, selling means I do. The sale of one’s\n  chametz, far from  fortifying his bitul, would undermine it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The primary reason is to inherit the World to Come, as explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Messilat_Yesharim.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesilas Yesharim chapter 1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה מה שהורונו חכמינו זכרונם לברכה הוא, שהאדם לא נברא אלא להתענג על ה' ולהנות מזיו שכינתו שזהו התענוג האמיתי והעידון הגדול מכל העידונים שיכולים להמצא. ומקום העידון הזה באמת הוא העולם הבא, כי הוא הנברא בהכנה המצטרכת לדבר הזה. אך הדרך כדי להגיע אל מחוז חפצנו זה, הוא זה העולם. והוא מה שאמרו זכרונם לברכה (אבות ד): העולם הזה דומה לפרוזדור בפני העולם הבא. והאמצעים המגיעים את האדם לתכלית הזה, הם המצוות אשר צונו עליהן האל יתברך שמו.</p>\n<p>Behold, what our sages, of blessed memory, have taught us is that man was created solely to delight in G-d and to derive pleasure in the radiance of the Shechina (divine presence). For this is the true delight and the greatest pleasure that can possibly exist. The place of this pleasure is, in truth, in Olam Haba (the World to Come). For it was created expressly for this purpose. But the path to arrive at the \"desired haven\" (Ps. 107:30) of ours is this world. This is what our sages of blessed memory said: \"this world is like a corridor before the World to Come\" (Avot 4:16). The means that lead a person to this goal are the commandments which the blessed G-d commanded to us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A secondary purpose of fulfilling the commandments is that the world as a whole is perfected by this. (Not necessarily in a physical sense, but by being used to fulfill God's will, He sees to it that the whole world is brought directly to its perfection.) As explained later in that chapter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם הוא שולט בעצמו ונדבק בבוראו ומשתמש מן העולם רק להיות לו לסיוע לעבודת בוראו, הוא מתעלה והעולם עצמו מתעלה עמו. כי הנה עילוי גדול הוא לבריות כולם בהיותם משמשי האדם השלם המקודש בקדושתו יתברך</p>\n<p>But if he rules over himself and clings to his Creator, and uses the world only as an aid to serve his Creator - then he elevates himself and elevates the world with him. For all creations are greatly elevated when they serve the \"Adam HaShalem\" (whole/perfect man) who is sanctified with the holiness of the blessed G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These ideas are expanded upon throughout the first chapter of Mesilas Yesharim. I recommend studying it well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are numerous answers, and I cannot pretend to do a survey of all of them. I will just stay focused on the opinions that emerged in Eastern Europe since the Enlightenment turned \"Why be Jewish?\" into a question worth asking.</p>\n<p>The Chassidic movement emphasizes G-d's Immanence. G-d's absence from the world is just an illusion. And correspondingly, a person's job in this world is to achieve <em>deveiqus</em>, an attachment to the Almighty. And then various schools of Chassidic thought emerged with differences of opinion not only in the details, but the relative importance of intellect, emotion and the experiential in how to achieve <em>deveiqus</em> with the Divine.\nAnd so you find that the Tanya, the book that gave articulatin to Chabad thought (primarily found in Lubavitcher chassidus) placed more emphasis on thought. As another example, Ruzhin emphasized the experiential, and thus the Chassidic court, the venue where the chassid has his most intense experiences. The descendent movements of Ruzhin still today treat their rebbe like royalty, investing in his clothing, home, nowadays his limo -- everything to create a feeling of grandeur which colors the encounters with G-d one has when visiting the rebbe.</p>\n<p>When <em>Chassidus</em> started there was consequent pushback, and the Misnagdim (literally: Opponents) and other Jews primarily in Lithuania, articulated a worldview that was more directly a continuation of what had preexisted the new movement. The means to get \"close\" to G-d, who is not only Immanent but also Transcendent, is to emulate Him. Thus the goal of <em>mitzvos</em> is to achieve <em>sheleimus</em> (completeness) or temimus (wholeness with connotations of perfection).</p>\n<p>So the two streams of answers to your question in that environment was that we do mitzvos to connect to the Almighty or to perfect our \"tzelem E-lokim -- 'image' of G-d\" by emulating Him.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim Volozhiner (early 19th cent Lithuania) instituted the modern yeshiva movement. (Although arguably today's yeshivos lack full continuity with the pre-WWII Lithuanian original.) He was a student of one of the central pillars among the Misnagdim, the Vlina Gaon. Rav Chaim wrote the notebooks that his son collected into Nefesh haChaim. Three of the four sections of Nefesh haChaim deal with mitzvot -- section 1 is about those of action, section 2 about prayer and blessings, and section 4 is about Torah study. (Section 3 is about how G-d created, and lays groundwork for section 4.)</p>\n<p>According to Nefesh haChaim, through speech we repair the break between this universe and loftier existences. Qabbalah views this \"break\" as a necessary step in creating the universe; without some distance from the spiritual, the physical could not exist. But it is our job to unify all of creation.</p>\n<p>In fact, being in the image of E-lohim, which means \"Master of all Forces\" means that humans alone are comprised of all the forces in existence. Animals work in the more physical realms, angels only in the more spiritual. Only human beings span these realms. And thus only humans can connect them.</p>\n<p>For that matter, it is only the \"lever\" of the human soul by which actions in this universe can impact higher forces, because we are the only point of contact. And so, by doing mitzvot and refining one's soul one connects this world to the others, and thus perform \"tiqun olam\" as Qabbalah uses the term.</p>\n<p>Similarly, section 2 discusses how speech brings the spirituality of the higher worlds into this one. By making a berakhah before eating an apple, one makes all the metaphysics that went into making that apple manifest. To eat without a blessing is robbery. Not, as you might assume, robbing the apple from G-d. Rather, robbing the world of the spirituality inherent in that apple.</p>\n<p>And section 4 says that Torah study gives this world the \"power\" to continue existing. Because it is the inernalization of Divine Thought into the human mind, it brings G-dliness into the universe.</p>\n<p>So in all three ways -- action, speech, and thought -- mitzvot act to metaphysically fix the world, but in the only way we can, by metaphysically fixing ourselves.</p>\n<p>And much rests on the early chapters of section 4, and Rav Chaim Volozhiner's description of what it means to internalize the mind of G-d. Something that led to another ideological split, this one within Lithuania.</p>\n<p>Rav Yitzchaq Volozhiner, the son who wove his father's works, added his own notes and introduction to produce Nefesh haChaim, wrote this memory of Rav Chaim in the introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה רגיל להוכיח אותי על שראה שאינני משתתף בצערא דאחרינא. וכה היה דברו אלי תמיד שזה כל האדם. לא לעצמו נברא רק להועיל לאחריני ככל אשר ימצא בכחו לעשות.</p>\n<p>He regularly rebuked me, because he saw that I did not participate in the pain of others. And these were his constant words to me: This is the entire person. One is not created for himself, but to benefit others to the full extent of his abilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So all that fixing the world framework has to accomodate the fact that its author felt the whole purpose of a person is to \"benefit others to the full extent of his abilities.\"</p>\n<p>Within Lithuanian though there was another split. Less ideological than tactical. Both can be said to come from understandings of the early chapters of section 4 of Nefesh haChaim. He compares Torah study to immersion in the <em>miqvah</em>, it purifies the soul. And just as a person stays <em>tahor</em> after dry, a person's soul is shaped by the act of studying, even if the content is forgotten.</p>\n<p>In what became the Yeshiva Movement, the belief was that one studies Torah and performs mitzvos, and the self-refinement happens in-and-of itself.</p>\n<p>The Mussar Movement was founded by Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, who observed that this doesn't actually happen. Rather, Torah study of the sort the mitzvah calls for is the kind of study that is internalized and refines the soul. One has to consciously work at improving one's middos (character traits) to better imitate G-d and benefit others, and Torah and mitzvos are exercises Hashem gave us toward those ends.</p>\n<p>My own philosophy is founded on Rabbi Shimon Shkops, a Lithuanian Rosh Yeshiva (in the city of Grodno) in the early 20th century who often spoke of his aspirations to emulate Rabbi Yisrael. Rabbi Shkop opens <a href=\"https://www.aishdas.org/asp/ShaareiYosher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the introduction to his magnum opus</a>, Shaarei Yosher, with the words (translation mine, taken from page 45 of my book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TwheFU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Widen Your Tent</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יתברך הבורא ויתעלה היוצר שבראנו בצלמו ובדמות תבניתו, וחיי עולם נטע בתוכנו, שיהיה אדיר חפצנו, להיטיב עם זולתנו, ליחיד ולרבים בהוה ובעתיד בדמות הבורא כביכול</p>\n<p>Blessed shall be the Creator, and exalted shall be the Maker, Who created us in His “Image” and in the likeness of His “Structure”, and planted eternal life within us, so that our greatest desire should be to do good to others, to individuals and to the masses, now and in the future, in imitation of the Creator (as it were).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That phrase \"planted eternal life within us\" is taken from the berakhah before Torah study or the public reading. It refers to the Torah.</p>\n<p>According to Rav Shimon, and of all the approaches the one I personally lean toward, the answer to your question is that we were given mitzvot so that we could (1) better connect to G-d so that we can share His Good with others, (2) develop the kind of character so that it is \"our greatest desire\", so that we are motivated to benefit others in the future.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The purpose of the Torah is human-oriented, not G-d-oriented since God is all-powerful and does not need to see people doing mitzvot, as if G-d needs people to observe the commands for some undisclosed reason.</p>\n\n<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to Perek Chelek Maimonides writes that people only achieve immortality when they develop their minds, not based on the care that they take in observing Torah commands. Thus, Maimonides stated that the purpose of the Torah is three-fold: to teach true ideas and helps improve individuals and society. People fulfill the Bible’s mandate, he stressed, when and only when they study and understand about science and the laws of nature and use their knowledge of the world to improve themselves and society. Thus, Maimonides considered it a mitzvah to study science.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides explains,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If G-d revealed the reasons for all the commandments, they would find\n  ways to disobey them... In such a way, the entire Torah could be\n  nullified... [However] there is not a single commandment that does not\n  have a reason or a purpose. The majority of these causes and reasons,\n  though, cannot be grasped or understood by the masses\" (emphasis\n  added).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And any [woman] who secludes herself in her home is fitting to marry the High Priest, as it is stated (Psalms 45:14), \"All the honor of the king's daughter indoors, [is more than gold checkered clothing] etc,\" which means to say, that she will marry someone, about whom it is written (Exodus 28:39), \"and you shall make checkered [...].\" And she is fitting to have High Priests come from her, as it is stated (Psalms 128:3), \"your sons will be like olive plantings;\" meaning that they will be anointed with olive oil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(all translations copied directly from sefaria)</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps there is an explanation -- and if not, how can I directly ask my father if he is planning to sacrifice me.</p>\n\n<p>So too, Avraham's answer -- is both open-ended and indirect.  G-d will chose for himself the sacrifice (the word יראה is sometimes used in the Chumash in the sense of to choose).  That sacrifice may be you, may not.  And just like Yitzhok did not directly ask his father whether he planned to sacrifice him, Avaraham also did not directly tell Yitzhok that he may be commanded to sacrifice him.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Avraham's answer was a) relating to the substance and style of Yitzhok's question as well as b) relating to the fact that he did not know what was the Divine plan.</p>\n\n\n",

Enkidu of Akkadian mythology in the Epic of Gilgamesh; (according to some scholars) is depicted as a Bull-Man who is fighting with a lion. </p>\n\n<p>The Tanach even tells us that King David killed a lion as a young shepherd (and a bear). However, no one claims that the King David story \"copied\" the Samson story.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, many world cultures realized that lions are powerful creatures and if any culture would spin a yarn about a hero, it is in all likelihood common, to see a chapter in the hero's story, depict the hero as slaying a strong and dangerous beast like a lion.</p>\n\n<p>So if two stories have scenes where the hero slays a lion, it would force absolutely nothing as far as suggesting a common origin or \"borrowing\" from one culture to the next. Why would a culture borrow such a story when they can easily make it up themselves!?</p>\n\n<p>Other than that though, the two stories of Samson and Heracles have no substantial similarities.</p>\n\n<p>The Tanach has been passed down to us in word for word format from our nation as a whole by the Prophets and spiritual leaders and common masses of Israel. The words have not been changed.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the story mentions Samson's real life father by name and his mother, as well as their residence and tribe, in a specific timeframe of history. Many historical details also appear in the story.</p>\n\n<p>There is really no reason to believe that the historical account presented and preserved, by a nation to its children for thousands of years, should be some fake myth.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, just suggesting so doesn't make it so. The burden of proof to say that the story is myth or borrowed, rests upon the one asserting that it is a myth.</p>\n\n<p>So no, the Tanach does not contain myth or falsehood. The Jewish people safely relies on their solid Masorah (tradition).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If our leadership do not take disease outbreaks seriously, are they considered responsible for deaths that follow?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As of late, there has been a controversy in various Jewish communities around the world. Certain Rabbis and certain individuals have actively circumvented the preventative measures to help stop the Coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/police-bid-to-convince-rabbi-to-close-yeshivas-as-his-sect-defies-virus-rules/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In specific instances there have been leaders outright arguing Coronavirus is less dangerous than closing Yeshivas to prevent Coronavirus.</a> </p>\n\n<p>My question relates to the nature of murder in Jewish law. I understand that disease may have not been fully fleshed out <strong><em>(in terms of scientific understanding of diease at the time)</em></strong> when our murder laws were first codified and established. That being said, does Halacha exist which is specific to the spread of disease <strong><em>(the reckless spread of disease through a lack of care and the resulting deaths that may follow)</em></strong> and how a Jew may be held liable for disease death in the same way they would other forms of reckless death.</p>\n\n<p>If a Rabbi didn't take the issue seriously enough and their community suffered deaths as a result of not following through on the virus prevention techniques, are they not considered responsible for not decreeing changes to practice for safety?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weddings were held regardless of the gathering ban.</li>\n<li>Minyans were held regardless of the gathering ban.</li>\n<li>Yeshivas aren't closed even when local secular officials have declared a state of emergency and require closures.</li>\n<li>Mikvahs were kept open regardless of the disease risk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We now know how this is spreading and we know for a fact that certain types of behavior are causing this to spread faster. The Jewish community as a whole has suffered dearly from inflated infection rates and deaths have followed. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a responsibility on the leadership (whether spiritually or otherwise) which actively ignored preventative measures? What does Halacha have to day about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>When gedalai was told that someone was planing o killing him, Gedalia ignored it.

That is why the passuk says these men who gedalia killed.{rashi, Mtzudat david}</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>We should be cautious not to put the blame on any specific rabbi since coronavirus was a natural event. However, the Talmud (I forget the source but the point is definitely there) states that one who is killed due to irresponsibility loses share in the world to come.[1] As I have written previously <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/111468/19691\">here</a>, the world works according to the laws of nature. One of these laws is that every act has consequences. Whether or not G-d forgives, the consequences do not go away. For example, David issued a census, announced it publicly, resulting in the murder of tens of thousands of Israelites following David ordering a census. </p>\n\n<p>So in light of David's acts (David also repented), what do we make of the rabbis who refused to close yeshivahs because the \"<a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2020/03/who-really-believes-that-torah-protects.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah protects</a>\"?[2] It is true that Rav Chaim Kanievksy and Rav Gershon Edelstein said that \"cancelling yeshivah studies [is] more dangerous than being exposed to coronavirus,\" but the charedim do not have the internet or FaceBook to learn information about the virus.[3] Although charedim only make up about 10% of the Jewish population in Israel, they encompass 50% of cases. Partly because, despite government demands and Bibi's restrictions, they continued to attend yeshivahs, shuls, mikvahs, and street minyan. In short, Chareidi communities are devastated. This prompted Rav Chaim Kanievsky and Rav Gershon Edelstein to rule that it is forbidden to davven, attend a street minyan, yeshivahs, and shul, and anyone who says otherwise is a rodef must be escorted to the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that Chareidi Jews are finally taking the coronavirus crisis seriously. However, it is partly not their fault since Chareidi communities are mostly made up of crowded communities. Yet the rabbinic leadership failed to recognize the danger when everyone else was shouting for social distancing.[4] For example, prior to the Holocaust, many Charedi Jews said to stay in Europe because they possessed \"Daas Torah.\" We all know the sad result of that. Now some are saying again that there is no real danger with the coronavirus. </p>\n\n<p>In short, Rabbi Slifkin put it best when he wrote,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"What is \"Daas Torah\" worth, when the average non-charedi, non\n  ben-Torah, was correct, and Daas Torah was wrong, in a life-and-death\n  matter?!\"[5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[1] For example, reckless driving.</p>\n\n<p>[2] See essay another <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2015/11/practically-speaking-torah-does-not.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (All essays were written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin)</p>\n\n<p>[3] For example, \"kosher\" phones do not have internet.</p>\n\n<p>[4] See essay <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2020/03/understanding-charedi-response-to.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>[5] To see full essay, see <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2020/03/the-death-of-daas-torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

These groups also rotated being on-duty through the year, but instead of serving in the Temple, members of the week's <em>ma'amad</em> would assume \"ownership\" responsibility on behalf of all of Israel for the public offerings brought in the Temple that week, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/korban-tamid-continuous-beginning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Korban Tamid</em></a>. The mishnayot and the Gemara on them (<a href=\"https://sefaria.org/taanit.27a-28a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta'anit 27a-28a</a>) describe practices the members of the week's <em>ma'amad</em> would undertake, including special prayers and Torah readings and fasting.</p>\n<p>We are not bringing offerings in the Temple now, but we do still take responsibility for the daily <em>Tamid</em> by reading the Torah's instructions for it before prayers. The Talmud <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.27b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> explicitly calls out this substitution. In a Midrashic passage, God tells Abraham about the Korban Tamid, and then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לפניו רבש\"ע תינח בזמן שבית המקדש קיים בזמן שאין בית המקדש קיים מה תהא עליהם אמר לו כבר תקנתי להם סדר קרבנות בזמן שקוראין בהן לפני מעלה אני עליהם כאילו הקריבום לפני ואני מוחל להם על כל עונותיהם</p>\n<p>Abraham said before God: Master of the Universe, this works out well when the Temple is standing, but when the Temple is not standing, what will become of them? God said to him: I have already enacted for them the order of offerings. When they read them before Me, I will ascribe them credit as though they had sacrificed them before Me and I will pardon them for all their transgressions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it seems to me that it could be valid and valuable to organize modern-day \"<em>ma'amadot</em>,\" focused around the recitation of Temple service passages instead of the Temple service itself, and presumably omitting drastic changes in the established standard liturgy. I don't expect that I'm the first person in the last 2000 years to consider this. Has there ever been a prominent proposal or movement to recreate such an organization?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is an extensive collection of readings toward this sort of purpose  printed in some siddurim called <em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Ma%27amadot?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Ma'amadot</a></em>. I'm asking about whether anyone has proposed a system of rotating focused responsibility.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Translating וידבר using BDB Lexicon and Gesenius' Grammar\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Context</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am practicing my biblical Hebrew by translating the weekly Parshah. As resources, I have the Brown-Driver-Briggs (BDB) Lexicon (coded with Strong's concordance numbers) and Gesenius' Grammar - specifically the edition expanded and edited by Kautzsch. I am using the Stone edition Chumash, which includes both vowelized Hebrew and English translation. After translating a sentence myself, I then cross-check to see the differences between my translation and the Stone translation, note which ones are obvious mistakes on my part and then make notes on the more ambiguous differences to ask my Rabbi (or here) later. This question pertains to Lev 6:1, and specifically the opening word of the Hebrew: וַיְדַבֵר (translated by Stone as \"spoke\" in the clause: :וַיְדַבֵר יהוה אל–משה לֵאמְֹר - \"Hashem spoke to Moses, saying:\").</p>\n\n<p><strong>Actual Question(s)</strong></p>\n\n<p>What does the vav-consecutive in וַיְדַבֵר tell us about the tense of the word? Am I misreading the prefix here as the vav-consecutive?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What My Sources Say</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to better understand the vav-consecutive as a grammatical tool. In Gesenius, §49 (a), the vav-consecutive is described as setting up a series of sequential events. In this same section, Gesenius notes that if the first verb of the sequence -- I assume this means the verb attached to the pregnant vav -- is in the perfect tense, the rest are in the imperfect and the entire sequence represents a series of past events. For a chain of future events, the converse is true: the first verb is imperfect and the rest of the verbs are perfect. </p>\n\n<p>There is only one other verb in this clause, לֵאמְֹר, and BDB states that it is \"especially infinite, after וַיְדַבֵר (p. 55-56, entry 559.1), which is helpful for translating this sentence, but not super helpful for understanding the underlying grammatical structure in question. However, יְדַבֵר is stated as being in the <em>imperfect</em> by BDB (p. 180, sec 1696). This would initially make me think to translate this sentence in the future tense: </p>\n\n<p><em>\"Hashem will speak to Moses, to say:\"</em></p>\n\n<p>However, this seems intuitively not correct. What am I missing here? There is another entry for דַבֵר in the same section cited above that states it takes the imperative. But this also seems like a weird translation to me. </p>\n\n<p>Any help or guidance to sources that will explain this to me (even citations within Gesenius I may be missing) would be helpful. Thank you!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Biblical Hebrew uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vav-consecutive\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vav ha-hipuch</a> – it converts future tense to past. \"Yedaber\" – He will speak. \"Vaydaber\" – He spoke.</p>\n\n<p>It's debated whether such a vav <em>also</em> indicates connection – is it \"and he spoke\" or just \"he spoke.\" But that's the basic function.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Non-religious to religious help!",
    "content": "# Non-religious to religious help!\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a personal question and I am seeking some guidance. Here is a little bit of background information so that you understand a little of what the situation is.</p>\n\n<p>So both of my parents are Jewish and both have grown up non-observant and their house was also not strict on being observant or not. They moved to the U.S and have lost connection with almost all their Jewishness. My mother was convinced to go to this church and she decided to go and she said she liked it and then my father also started going. Then we all went together because it was the \"normal\" thing to do, however my mother never really studied it, but my father did and for some reason he studied the Torah more (which is good of course). This continued and when I was 13 or 14 my father started to tell me about his parents and his grandparents on how they were Jewish but never were observant. He studied even more Torah along with the new testament and came to the conclusion that church wasn't for him and that he wanted to be more observant in Torah because it feels right and it feels better. I was just introduced to the idea that I am Jewish and I personally grew up all my life inside a church, but I always had doubts on many things. I started to look into it and once my mother noticed I was getting more interested about Judaism and that I started observing very slow with the \"easy\" stuff like keeping Kosher and the Shema, she became very angry. And I still do not understand why, but whenever my father and I would have a conversation about Torah, she would intervene and start talking about church (even though she doesn't study, not even the new testament, she just goes to church). But this has been going on for the past 5 years and the more my father and I learn and start to become little more observant, the more she denies her Jewishness. She even recently said that she doesn't believe in any of this (the Torah) and this made me really really upset.\nI think it is good to mention that my parents weren't married the Jewish way, and that my father and I are scared to contact local Rabbis because we don't really have solid proof of our Jewishness and that we strayed from Judaism by going to church. Oh and I have two younger siblings and sometimes we try to teach them Torah as well by my mom intervenes by telling them that it doesn't matter and that they can do whatever because its an \"old book\" and things of these sorts.</p>\n\n<p>So now there is some context, my question is how can I be more observant in an essentially non-religious household. My mother hates it whenever my father and I bring up anything from the Torah. We don't even light Shabbat candles and Pesach is next week and she refuses to throw anything away. It makes me cry and I am very saddened because I truly want to observe all of these things, but is there a point in trying if I can't even fulfill the entire mitzva? What should I do? My father and I have completely left the church and have done Teshuva for this sin, but my mother goes at least once a month now because she doesn't like going by herself, and my father has been trying to show my mother a little more and more of the Torah and remind her of her Jewishness but she doesn't listen to a single word. Is there anything I can do, should I even try to show her Torah or try to get her to do what is right? At least even allow us to fulfill these mitzvot?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long story and questions, but there is just so much going on and it breaks my heart that this is the case. \nThank you very much and may H'Shem bless you!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can the Rambam say anointing a King requires a Sanhedrin, when Shmuel anointed King David alone?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam says a King must be anointed by a Sanhedrin, why did Shmuel seemingly go alone in secret?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rambam never says he has to be <em>anointed</em> in the presence of a Sanhedrin. I assume you refer to Melachim 1:3, where he writes – and uses Shaul as a proof! –</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵין מַעֲמִידִין מֶלֶךְ בַּתְּחִלָּה אֶלָּא עַל פִּי בֵּית דִּין שֶׁל שִׁבְעִים זְקֵנִים וְעַל פִּי נָבִיא. כִּיהוֹשֻׁעַ שֶׁמִּנָּהוּ משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ וּבֵית דִּינוֹ. וּכְשָׁאוּל וְדָוִד שֶׁמִּנָּם שְׁמוּאֵל הָרָמָתִי וּבֵית דִּינוֹ:</p>\n<p>We only initially appoint a king on the word of a court of 70 elders and a prophet, like Yehoshua, appointed by Moshe and his court, and like Shaul and David, appointed by Shmuel and his court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently we have a tradition that he got it confirmed by his court before going to meet Shaul. While I’m unclear on where in the story this occurred, perhaps the Rambam is basing himself on Shmuel I:9:22:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקַּ֤ח שְׁמוּאֵל֙ אֶת־שָׁא֣וּל וְאֶֽת־נַעֲר֔וֹ וַיְבִיאֵ֖ם לִשְׁכָּ֑תָה</p>\n<p>And Shmuel took Shaul and his youth and brought them to his chamber</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>interpreting “his chamber” as a reference to his court. I have not seen anyone who says this, however.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188345/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Melachim uMilchamot - Chapter 1</a> halacha 3 is talking about the normal situation in which a king must be appointed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3 As an initial and preferred option, a king may be appointed only by\n  a court of 70 elders, together with a prophet, as Joshua was appointed\n  by Moses and his court, and as Saul and David, were appointed by\n  Samuel of Ramah and his court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that this implies that Shmuel actually convened his Sanhedrin as the Shofeit in charge of Bnai Yisrael to anoint Shmuel as king in front of the people that he had called together.</p>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15838/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-9.htm#v15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel I 9:15</a> Shmuel is acting on the direct command of Hashem. As a result, when Shaul comes, Shmuel fulfills the prophecy and anoints Shaul as king. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>15 Now, the Lord had revealed to Samuel one day before Saul's coming,\n  saying,</p>\n  \n  <p>16 \"At this time tomorrow, I shall send to you a man from the land of\n  Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be a ruler of my people Israel,\n  and he will save My people from the hand of the Philistines, for I\n  have looked upon My people, for their cry has come to Me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam implies that when <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15839/jewish/Chapter-10.htm/showrashi/true#v17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel I 10:17</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Samuel called the people together unto God to Mizpah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that the Sanhedrin was there with Shmuel. However, all of this was done at the specific command of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Again with respect to David Hamelech, Shmuel acted on the express command of Hashem as we see in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15845/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel I 16:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1 And the Lord said to Samuel, \"Until when are you mourning for Saul,\n  when I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn\n  with oil, and come, I shall send you to Jesse, the Bethlehemite, for I\n  have seen for Myself a king among his sons.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15845/showrashi/true#v13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 13</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>13 And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of\n  his brothers. And a spirit of the Lord passed over David from that day\n  forth, and Samuel arose and went to Ramah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication was that this was the initial annointing at the command of Hashem and Shmuel was acting as the navi and head of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin of Yehudah accepted him initially after Shaul died and the rest of the tribes accepted him later.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11338/when-did-david-hamelech-become-king?rq=1\">When did David Hamelech become king?</a></p>\n\n\n",

Minyans have been included in such restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Though this is the case, certain groups have been shown praying together while respecting the recommended safe social distance between one another. <em>It is basically a regular minyan but everyone is six feet apart to lower disease risk.</em></p>\n\n<p>This compromise raised a question in me. <strong>Is there a Halachally defined minimum distance for a minyan to count?</strong> What I mean is, at a certain point (logically) there needs to be a line which defines when a group are still considered a group vs individuals all spread apart. Six feet apart and you are still in a minyan. What about 7 though? Or 8 or 9 or so on? </p>\n\n<p><strong>At a certain point, there would need to be a line where the minyan no longer counts.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>It couldn't be intention alone or a minyan over live stream would count.

However, the Minchas Yitzchok adds two conditions which must be met:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תלוי ב<strong>שמיעת הש\"ץ</strong> המבואר (באו\"ח סי' קכד), ו<strong>ברואים זה את זה</strong>, והיינו\n  אפילו אם המה בשני חדרים לגמרי, ומקורו מדברי הרשב\"א (בתשובה סי' צו).\n  ואף דלהלכה יש חולקים ומחמירים וכמבואר שם בשערי תשובה (אות מז), מכל\n  מקום באין מחיצה מפסיק ביניהם, אף שאינם בבית אחד אלא בשדה שפיר יש לומר\n  דמהני רואים זה את זה לכו\"ע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A <em>minyan</em> taking place [outdoors] needs to meet two conditions: They must be able to hear the Shliach Tzibbur, and must be able to see each other.</p>\n\n<p>If they are indoors, there is another possible condition [subject to debate between the Poskim] - some require all members of the minyan to be in the same room (without a halachic mechitza); others require at least ten to be in the same room - after which others can be <em>mitztaref</em> from another room; some permit even if the minyan is split between two rooms (as long as there is no public domain in between them).</p>\n\n<p>In the laws of <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Zimmun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zimun</a> (where a minyan is required to add the Divine Name אלקינו), ten people are considered a minyan even if they are split between two rooms, provided that they can see each other. The Rashba (Responsa 91) says it's possible this law extends to Tefilla as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוד אני אומר שאפשר לומר שכל שרואים אלו את אלו כאילו הן בבית אחד דמי\n  ומצטרפים. ודומיא דזימון של ברכת המזון דתנן (ברכות פ\"ז מ\"ה) שתי חבורות\n  שהיו אוכלות בבית אחד בזמן שמקצתם רואים אלו את אלו, הרי אלו מצטרפים\n  לזימון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 55</a>), with Mishne Beruro (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%94#%D7%A0%D7%91_%D7%9E%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.52</a>) and Biur Halocho (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad loc</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Other authorities disagree - see, for example, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1095&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishkenos Yackov (#75)</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara later (<a href=\"https://Sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.59b.25-60a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">60a</a>) discusses R’ Shimon’s source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"ש אומר אף על הכישוף: מ\"ט דר\"ש דכתיב (שמות כב, יז) מכשפה לא תחיה וכתיב (שמות כב, יח) כל שוכב עם בהמה מות יומת כל שישנו בכלל כל שוכב עם בהמה ישנו בכלל מכשפה לא תחיה:</p>\n<p>R’ Shimon says: also on witchcraft. What’s the reason for R’ Shimon? As it is written, “A witch shall not live,” and it is written [in the immediately following verse], “Whoever lies with an animal will be killed.” Whoever is obligated in bestiality is also obligated in witchcraft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara does not explain why the other opinions reject this source.</p>\n<p>When the Rambam discusses the halachos of non-Jews in Melachim ch. 9-10, he only discusses the laws of the basic seven, plus a few others which the Gemara says are subsets of them. This implies that in practice we do not hold that witchcraft is prohibited for non-Jews, and they are allowed to practice witchcraft as they wish.</p>\n\n\n",

His death is then retained in his blindness.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, some aspects of Rabbinic tradition maintain that Isaac was not only slaughtered, but complete burt and his ashes scattered before being resurrected. Here's an blog post <a href=\"http://curiousjew.blogspot.com/2007/01/isaac-died-alternative-version-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://curiousjew.blogspot.com/2007/01/isaac-died-alternative-version-of.html</a> that goes into this, mostly following ideas in The Last Trial: On the Legends and Lore of the Command to Abraham to Offer Isaac as a Sacrifice.

Perhaps either R. Zedekiah bar Abraham delli Mansi or some pious soul of an earlier generation was exercising restraint- for reasons similar to those which prompted R. Isaac Aboab to omit that haggadah entirely from beginning to end. For this MS reads: \"When Abraham bound his son Isaac on the altar, and slew him and burned him, (the lad) was reduced to ashes, and his ashes were scattered on Mount Moriah; then the Holy One, blessed be He, brought down life-giving dew and revived him [...] See S. Spiegel in the Abraham Weiss Jubilee Volume (New York, 1964), pp. 553-566.]</p>\n\n<p>In this case, Isaac was slaughtered, and Avraham slew him.\"</p>\n\n<p>also</p>\n\n<p>\" in Abraham ibn Ezra's language, in his commentary (Gen 22:19) : The father acted \"contrary to Scripture,\" \"for he slaughtered and abandoned\" Isaac on the altar.

In such a case He's accepting the outcry and reacts to it; i.e. in such a case He knows what to do to set things straight. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 18:21</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I will descend now and see, whether according to her cry, which has\n  come to Me, they have done; [I will wreak] destruction [upon them];\n  and if not, I will know.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates this as being connected to verse 20.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>20 And Hashem said (to Avraham): Even if the outcry over Sodom and\n  Gemorrah is great, and their sin weighs exceedingly heavy,</p>\n  \n  <p>21 I will still go down and see whether, in accordance with the cry\n  which hath come to Me, they have achieved complete destruction, and if\n  not I will discriminate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that this means that Hashem is telling Avraham that any punishment (even though He knows what is going on) requires a specific ירידה, an exact investigation, before declaring what the proper punishment will be. In his commentary on verses 23 - 26 Rav Hirsch explains what the two possible punishments could be and what Avraham thinks about them. In this case the term אֵדָעָה does not mean that Hashem does not know, but that He will demonstrate the knowledge by punishing only the wicked. This is similar to the difference between the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Tower of Bavel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two alternatives were announced to Abraham for the threatened fate of\n  Sodom, כלה: complete destruction, or ידיעה: punishment of the guilty\n  but allowing the whole to continue. As Hashem had found him worthy of\n  being given insight into His verdict, he feels and thinks deeply of\n  the execution of the verdict, and tries to get clear concerning a\n  thought which worries him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Did G-d have to descend to investigate a matter in Genesis 18:20 and 21?</p>\n\n<p>A literal reading of the Bible thinks so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“G-d said, ‘the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their misdeeds\n  are very grievous. I will go down now and see whether they acted as\n  [indicated in] the cry that has come up to me, then I will destroy\n  them, if not I will know.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The phrase, \"if not I will know\" is obscure. The simple reading has G-d wondering if He heard correctly, to clarify this, G-d will descend and investigate what is really happening. The prior phrase states that if He discovers that the people did not act properly, he will “destroy them.” G-d concludes “if not,” meaning that they were righteous, then “I will know” this and not harm them.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi supports the notion of a <a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/Vol7Slifkinwithletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">corporeal</a> deity descending when he portrays G-d anthropomorphically. Scripture states: “G-d came down to see the city and the tower that the people built [the Tower of Babel].”</p>\n\n<p>Regarding both stories, the Midrash Tanchuma asks “Does G-d need to descend and see?” it asks. “Isn’t everything known before Him?”</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash explains these stories to be a figure of speech. It informs judges not to make a decision only after a brief insufficient investigation. G-d is all-knowing and all-powerful and does not need to descend to hear or prove anything. Additionally, Onkelos substitutes the anthropomorphic “I will go down” to “I will reveal Myself.” There is nothing that G-d does not already know, He is certainly not taking a trip to learn about circumstances in which He has no prior knowledge. Rather, He is “revealing,” informing them that He is reacting to the evil done. In his commentary to Exodus 19:20, 33:21 and 34:5, Abraham ibn Ezra paraphrases Onkelos and Midrash. In his Guide of the Perplexed 1:10, Maimonides explains the terms “go down” and “go up” is metaphorical, meaning that \"going up\" indicates that divine revelation is taking place and \"go down\" means the communication has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides adds in Guide of the Perplexed 2:45 that all biblical prophecies, with the exception of Moses, were dreams. He writes on 1:10 that G-d's descent is a figure of speech, indicating that the divine decree to render punishment has been acted. Thus, Maimonides says that chapter 18, like the Akedah story, never took place. It was a dream. Abraham dreamed about a conversation with G-d, who descended in anthropomorphic terms. Maimonides will generally rehash a biblical story as a prophecy. This greatly angered Nachmanides, who insisted that the stories in the Bible were true events. It could be argued that the Rambam's interpretations greatly diminished the historical significance of the Bible.</p>\n\n\n",

As of now it seems the company is refusing  to abide.\nThis is not a question about American or international law. This is a question what would halacha dictate in this type of situation?</p>\n<p>Part of the company's reason to refuse is international backlash, including loss of imports of other life saving devices.

Ben Petora taught: It is preferable that both of them drink and die, and let neither one of them see the death of the other.

But I will post here one \nthat is very close -- so close that I conjecture that it is the one that Grunfeld had in mind, and that he was quoting from memory.</p>\n\n<p>The original was published in 1860 in Jeshurun, entitled “Aw: das Zion der Zukunft und die heutige Reform”, accessible via Digitale Judaica-Sammlungen der Universitätsbibliothek Frankfurt <a href=\"http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/2945015\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/2945015</a>, and it was reprinted in Hirsch's Gesammelte Schriften VI.  In the English translation in Hirsch's Collected Writings, vol. 1, 390=391, it reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p>“Perhaps the most radical cure in a time of confusion and the loss of all values would be the – provisional – closing of all Synagogues!  Let such an idea not frighten the reader.  The closing of all Synagogues would not affect or alter the precepts of the Divine Law one iota.   But even a hypothetical announcement of the removal of the prohibition against eating the gid ha-nasheh, the sinew of weakness, for example, would shatter the very foundation of God’s Law!  The closing of all Synagogues through Jewish hands would constitute the loudest protest against the denial of the Divine Law in life and home; it would give the most drastic emphasis to the truth that Divine Judaism embraces and dominates the totality of Jewish life and does not find its fulfilment in the halls of prayer and worship.  God’s Temple and His Law must rule and shape our daily lives – this would effect the lasting cure for all our ailments.  Then perhaps, we would again be worthy to regain our Synagogues and ultimately even the ‘bloody’ rite of sacrifices at Zion.”</p>\n\n<p>This is from one of Hirsch's essays on the month of Av, when the fast on the 9th commemorates the destruction of the Temple.  His point is that the Temple was destroyed because Jews lost sight of its higher purpose -- the localization of Jewish aspirations to serve God through the observance and study of the Torah, which was at the same time the localization of all people's aspirations to serve God through the full actualization of human powers -- and only in the absence of the Temple could the necessary reboot be undertaken.</p>\n\n\n",

However, many who follow the mimetic\ntradition eat the Charoset along with the Matzah and Maror.  We can\ndefend the mimetic tradition by noting that the Shulchan Aruch does\nnot explicitly state that one should remove the Charoset from the\nMaror used for the Korech sandwich.  Thus, the mimetic tradition seems\nto be in harmony with the straightforward reading of the Shulchan\nAruch.  Moreover, a TABC student suggested that perhaps the mimetic\ntradition seeks to accommodate the approach that the Rambam\narticulates in his Peirush HaMishnayot, that it is a Mitzvah to eat\nCharoset just as it is a Mitzvah to eat Maror and Matzah at the Seder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps this is where those who eat charoses with maror extend their tradition from eating charoses with the korech sandwich.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In order to answer such a question, we first must clarify the reason and source for shaking it off.</p>\n<p>In theory, there could be two bases for not having the charoset as part of what one eats.</p>\n<p>One is the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.115a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 115a</a> about having first matza, then maror, then korech, because otherwise the rabbinic maror would nullify the Biblical matzah. By implication in Tosafot's discussion there, there is a third level of reshut, which could nullify either of the other two levels. Perhaps the charoset, if reshut, would nullify the maror, which is Rabbinic. If this is the concern, see Shlomy's answer where the Ran dismisses the concern.</p>\n<p>However, to understand Rav Yosef Karo in Shulchan Aruch, you need to read the Tur and then Rav Yosef Karo's Bet Yosef commentary on the Tur. This forms the background from which he extracts the simple statements in Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>If we examine <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.475.1?lang=bi&with=Beit%20Yosef&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Orach Chaim 475</a> (with Bet Yosef on the side), we see the Tur writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אח\"כ יקח כזית מרור וישקענו כולו בחרוסת ולא ישהנו בתוכו שלא יתבטל טעם מרירתו ומטעם זה כתב ה\"ר יונה שצריך לנער החרוסת מעליו שלא יתבטל טעמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That the concern is about steeping maror in charoset for a long while, such that the taste would dissipate. And the Rabbenu Yona writes, <strong>for the same reason</strong> that therefore one needs to shake the charoset from upon it so that the taste should not be nullified. Nullified in this case is not the halachic nullification of earlier, of reshut nullifying derabbanan or derabbanan nullifying deorayta, but of the dissipation of the bitterness in the sweet charoset.</p>\n<p>Bet Yosef points us to the source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומ\"ש וישקענו כולו בחרוסת בפרק ע\"פ (קטו.) אמר רב פפא ש\"מ האי חסא צריך לשקועי דאי ס\"ד לא צריך לשקועי נטילת ידים למה ומיהו התם בגמרא דחינן ליה דדלמא לעולם אימא לך לא צריך לשקועי וקפא מריחא מיית אלא למה לי נטילת ידים דלמא משקעו ליה וא\"כ לא קי\"ל כרב פפא ולכן הרי\"ף והרמב\"ם והרא\"ש השמיטוהו אבל הרוקח הביאו ולכן כתבו רבינו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That gemara, despite the single dot in the quote, is actually a bit later, on Pesachim 115b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַב פָּפָּא: לָא נִישַׁהֵי אִינִישׁ מָרוֹר בַּחֲרוֹסֶת, דִּילְמָא אַגַּב חַלְיֵיהּ דְּתַבְלִין מְבַטֵּיל לֵיהּ לִמְרוֹרֵיהּ, וּבָעֵינַן טַעַם מָרוֹר, וְלֵיכָּא. אַדְבְּרֵיהּ רַב חִסְדָּא לְרַבָּנָא עוּקְבָא, וּדְרַשׁ: נָטַל יָדָיו בְּטִיבּוּל רִאשׁוֹן — נוֹטֵל יָדָיו בְּטִיבּוּל שְׁנֵי.\nAnd Rav Pappa said: A person should not leave bitter herbs in the ḥaroset for a lengthy period of time, lest the sweetness of the spices in the ḥaroset nullify its bitterness. And the bitter herbs require a bitter taste, and they are not bitter when marinated in ḥaroset. The Gemara reports: Rav Ḥisda authorized Rabbana Ukva to deliver a lecture, and he taught: If one washed his hands for the first dipping, he should wash his hands again for the second dipping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So when Rav Yosef Karo writes what he writes in Shulchan Aruch, he is echoing the specific chumra expressed by Rabbenu Yona.</p>\n<p>Now, let us turn to mimetic traditions, as referenced in NJM's answer. Basically, this is a minhag. There is a trend nowadays to look in Shulchan Aruch and explicit texts, and reason out what should be done. But at the time Shulchan Aruch was introduced (and at the time Mishneh Torah was introduced), it was controversial, because it seems to centralize ruling of halacha and delegitimizing the practice of learned rabbis in each community going through the sources and seeing what appears most correct, and ruling in such way.</p>\n<p>While Shulchan Aruch said this, endorsing the position of Rabbenu Yona that leaving the charoset on during eating would nullify the bitterness, it is quite possible that other Rishonim, or even other Acharonim, would not find this stringency persuasive or in line with Rav Pappa's idea. Just as cooking, or steeping in water (kavush kemevushal) transforms an inherent taste, so could steeping the maror in charoset for a long period. However, simply leaving the charoset on top of the maror would not cause the intrinsic bitterness to leave. You would taste the bitterness of the maror, and you would taste the sweetness of the charoset.</p>\n<p>It could be that in certain communities, following an understanding of halacha that was not in the particular text we are examining, they held otherwise. (And, for the reason described above.) And, despite the arising of the Shulchan Aruch to prominence, they kept their halachic practices as a mimetic tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

One may not visit the sick on the Sabbath.[2] These are the words\nof Beis Shammal — But Beis Hillel permits these activities on the\nShabbath.[3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hillel says we should visit the sick because these are acts of kindness (Aruch HaShulchan, Orach Chaim 287:1). Jews are even encouraged to visit and pray for the recovery of non-Jews (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 151:12). Just as G-d, The Holy One, visited Abraham when the patriarch was sick (Chapter 18 Genesis), so, too, we should visit the sick. This is called called “imitatio deo.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, visited the sick ... so should you visit\nthe sick (Midrash Sifrei; Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 14a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara cites a Baraisa about visiting the sick on the Shabbath:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages taught in a Baraisa: One who enters to visit a sick person\non the Shabbath SHOULD say: \"It is the Shabbath now, therefore we are\nprevented from crying out for your recovery, but recovery will come\nsoon.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that we should not pray to G-d on his behalf since this prayer will arouse weeping and sorrow. Rather, we are to offer him hope to lift his spirits (Ran).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And R' Meir says: One should say \"[The Sabbath] itself can have mercy\nand bring your recovery.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that if the sick person honors the Shabbat, perhaps he will merit a fast recovery. Thus, the Shabbat does not delay recovery but hastens it unaided by prayer (Maharsha)[4].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R' Yehudah says: One should say: \"May the Omnipresent have mercy on\nyou and on the sick of Israel.\" R' Yose says: \"May the Omnipresent\nhave mercy on you among the sick of Israel.\"[5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By using Rabbi Yose's formula which groups the sick person together with the sick of Israel, the prayer, offered on the behalf of many, becomes a dual prayer (Rashi). Although R' Yehudah and Yose agree with the Tannaim that this prayer should not be directed to G-d on the Shabbat (Maharsha).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Shevna, a prominent person in Jerusalem, would enter to visit a\nsick person on the Shabbat, he would say: \"Peace.\" And when leaving, he\nwould say: \"The Shababth prevents us from crying out for your\nrecovery, but recovery will come soon. [G-d's] mercies are many, and\nrest on the Sabbath in peace.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that G-d's mercies are so great that He will heal the sick on the Shabbat even without prayer. The person must observe Shabbat in peace. Shevna suggests one begins and ends their visit with the word shalom (peace), which is a Name of G-d.[6]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara specifies which of these Tannaic opinions is the source for\nthe following Amoraic statement:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With whom does this teaching states by R' Chanina accord?

Only “then will our mouths fill with laughter and our lips with song” (Psalms 126:2). When will that joyous era arrive? When “they will say among nations, the Lord has done great things with these” (Psalms 126:2). They said about Reish Lakish that throughout his life he did not fill his mouth with laughter in this world once he heard this statement from his teacher, Rabbi Yoḥanan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.31a.4?lang=bi&with=Ben%20Yehoyada&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada there points out</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אָמְרוּ עָלָיו עַל רֵישׁ לָקִישׁ, שֶׁמִּיָּמָיו לֹא מִלֵּא שְׂחוֹק פִּיו בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, מְכִי שַׁמְעָהּ מֵרַבִּי יוֹחָנָן רַבֵּיהּ. קשא ודאי כל מילי דחסידותא דשמע ריש לקיש מן ר' יוחנן הוה מקיים, ומאי שנא האי דקא משמע לן עלה, ונראה לי בס\"ד כי ריש לקיש היה טבעו בדחן, כמו בר קפרא, וכפי טבעו ומנהגו היה קשא עליו חסידות זו, ועם כל זה היה נזהר בה.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: They said about Reish Lakish...And this is strange, for surely all of the sayings of piety that Reish Lakish heard from Rabbi Yochanan he would keep, and what difference is what he heard here and what he heard elsewhere?

This obviously includes rooting out all traces of idols. If so, what is the meaning when the verse states: “And you shall destroy their name out of that place”? This means that it is a mitzva to give it a nickname...Therefore, the verse states: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; you shall detest it, and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item” (Deuteronomy 7:26).

The quality - meaning the reasoning of the humor - should be for a good cause, such as helping students learn Torah, pulling people out of depression or helping people fulfill a mitzvah.

It gets very confusing.)</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this criticism numerous times over the years and have heard people reference it. But I haven't been able to find it.</p>\n\n<p>Even while checking through the volume of Collected Writings dealing with education (I think vol. 5?) I didn't find anything about this topic (I checked most of the work.) \nI even found him making reference to a \"Cinderella\" situation, such that he clearly was familiar with them.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone shed light on this topic?\nThanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>You may want to check this reference to vol 3, p.263 on regard chanuka:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Teach the jewish chanuka, don't feed the child with fairy tales.

Perhaps I can come back to fill in some direct quotes, but Rabbi Hirsch's wordy style makes that quite the challenge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I found a quote from Yesodot Hachinuch pt. 2 (I don't know how that translates into the English version of the collected writings):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"על האם להיות 'חוה' לילדה, דהיינו לדובב אליו ולשוחח עמו, שכן הילדים מטבעם אוהבים\n  לשמוע ולהקשיב, והם שותים בצמא כל מילה של סיפור ושל לימוד. את הצמא הזה חבל לרוות\n  באגדות תפלות חסרות כל ערך חינוכי. לפי דעתנו אין מזון רוחני תפל יותר לרוחו ולדמיונו של\n  הילד מאשר האגדות האלה. אין אנו מבינים מה תועלת תצמח לילד מזה שמתארים לפניו עולם\n  ומלואו, והתיאור הוא מנוגד כולו למציאות. מה יועיל לילד סיפור על זאב הבולע סבתא, חובש\n  את מצנפת הלילה שלה וממתין לנכדה. מוטב לספר לו דברים מן המציאות, בעלי תוכן מוסרי\n  וחינוכי. חומר כזה לא יחסר לה לאם. היא אינה זקוקה לתיאורים מלאכותיים מאיזה עולם רחוק\n  בלתי מציאותי, שכן עולמו האמיתי של הילד - חדר הילדים, הבית, הגינה, העיר וכל סביבתו של\n  הילד, על מאורעותיה הקטנים והגדולים, כל אלה מהווים חומר עשיר ומגוון, אותו תוכל האֵם\n  לנצל כדי לאמן ולתרגל את תכונותיו של הילד ולהדריכו בדרך הטוב\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[My] translation:\nIt is for the mother to be 'Chava' to her child, meaning to speak to him and discuss things with him, as it is children's nature to listen, and they drink in thirst every word of story and study. It is a waste to Use up this thirst on fairy tales lacking any educational value. We do not understand what use will come of describing an entire world to a child, and that this description stands in complete contrast to reality. What use will a child find in a story about a wolf that swallows a grandmother, puts on its nightcap and awaits her granddaughter. It would be better to tell him things from reality, things of true ethical and educational value. Stuff will be abundant to the mother. She is not needing of artificial descriptions of a world far from reality, for the child's true world - the children's room, the house, the garden, the city and the entire surrounding area of the child, for all its great and small events, all of these take part in being a rich material, that the mother can use to train the child's character and condition him in the way of good.</p>\n\n\n",

At the time when he wrote this teshuvah, the epidemic had affected only non-Jews, so the question was whether it was likely to spread to Jews as well (which would then warrant declaring days of fasting and prayer). In this connection he quotes a passage from tomorrow's Daf Yomi (Shabbos 32a), שטנא בתרי אומי לא שליט (the Satan has no power over two nations at the same time), which would suggest that it might remain limited to the non-Jewish population. (Although he then cites other statements of Chazal that imply the contrary, and concludes that indeed a fast should be declared because of the likelihood of it spreading to the Jews too.)</p>\n<p>He then writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...מ\"מ הרמב\"ם ובעל הטורים ז\"ל ובעל השלחן ערוך לא חלקו בין גוים לישראל</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Rambam, the author of the Turim, and the author of Shulchan Aruch made no distinction between [an epidemic affecting] non-Jews or Jews...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question, then: who is this \"author of Shulchan Aruch\" that he's quoting? The standard Shulchan Aruch was written by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Yosef Caro</a>, who was born in 1488, some 20 years after the Rashbash passed away.

Even though [the latter] is not specifically at the same time, the Torah fixed this holiday for the memory of that matter, as it is stated (Leviticus 23:43), \"that I placed them in huts, etc.\" And likewise Chanukah, and likewise Purim [have observances tied to the events they commemorate). And in this same manner were all the days [listed] in the Scroll of Fasting, but they were annulled since Israel was not able to keep them.

Out of these three gezeiros, they were only strangers, the other two were not relevant to them.

Only the fact that they were strangers remains and that's what we keep at the seder.</p>\n<p>However, as stated above, we are still left with the question why the Cohen matzah stays intact.</p>\n\n\n",

Hashem will so-to-speak approach our forefather Avraham, and tell him: “Your children have sinned.” Avraham, uncharacteristically, will say: “Destroy them!” Hashem will say to Himself: “Avraham never really had a hard time raising kids. Let’s ask Yaakov, who struggled with childrearing. Maybe he’ll have mercy and pray for his descendants.” Hashem will tell Yaakov: “Your children have sinned.” Yaakov as well will respond: “Destroy them! They are sinners!” Hashem, will so-to-speak feel frustrated. He’ll say: “The old man Avraham doesn’t have reasoning, and the young Yaakov doesn’t have concern. Let’s see what Yitzchak has to say”.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem will tell Yitzchak: “Your children have sinned.” Yitzchak will respond: “Master of the World, they’re my children? Are they not Your children? From the moment they said, ‘We will do’ before they said, ‘We will listen’ <sup>3</sup> You called them ‘My firstborn son’ <sup>4</sup> And now, they’re considered my children and not Yours? Further, how much could they really have sinned? How many years does the average person live? Seventy years <sup>5</sup>? Take away the first twenty of those years, as a person is not held accountable in Heaven until they’re twenty. Of the remaining fifty, half of that is at night, when it’s not practical to sin. Of the remaining twenty-five, half of that is spent praying, eating, and relieving oneself.” Yitzchak concluded: “All that remains is twelve and a half years to sin. Hashem, if You can bear all of that, then great. If not, I’ll bear half myself, so long as You bear the other half. Even if You say that I have to bear all of it, behold, I offered myself to You on an altar.</p>\n\n<p>We see from here that it will only be Yitzchak who will try to defend us in the end of days <sup>6</sup>. In his merit, and due to his intervention, the Jews in the future will see Divine mercy and eternal redemption. Yitzchak’s winning argument will be that he bear half the Jews’ sins, and Hashem bear the other half. Perhaps, to hint to this future dialogue, we specifically break the middle matzah. This middle one is the one that represents Yitzchak. Half of it we keep for the Afikoman. In fact, we take the larger<sup>7</sup> half for the Afikoman. Maybe when Hashem and Yitzchak divide up the sins of the Jews, it won’t be evenly split. If there were to be one half that is larger than the other, presumably Hashem would take the larger half upon Himself. This is symbolized by the larger half being reserved for the Afikoman, eaten at the end of the seder, which represents the ultimate redemption <sup>8</sup>. That is to say, in the merit of our forefather Yitzchak, we will merit the ultimate redemption. May it come speedily in our days.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Based on <strong>Minchas Asher</strong> <em>Sichos Al HaMoadim Pesach s.v.</em> פלגא עלי ופלגא עלך, said over in a shiur on the Arbah Kosos given in 5773 (found in <a href=\"https://www.torahbase.org/four-kosos-5773/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.torahbase.org/four-kosos-5773/</a> at the end)</p>\n\n<p>[2] <strong>Shabbos</strong> 89b</p>\n\n<p>[3] <strong>Exodus</strong> 24:7</p>\n\n<p>[4] <strong><em>Ibid</em></strong> 4:22. This can’t be understood literally, as Hashem called them this while they were still in Egypt, and they said נעשה ונשמע after the Exodus. Perhaps since Hashem knew they would say this, they got this title even then</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> Based on <strong>Psalms</strong> 90:10</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> See <strong>Sanhedrin</strong> 107a which says all of the forefathers underwent tests, and <strong>Emes L’Yaakov</strong> to <strong>Genesis</strong> 27:12 understands that this dialogue will be Yitzchak’s test, as it goes against his inherent nature</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <strong>Magen Avraham</strong> 473:6 § 21, citing <strong>Sefer Maharil</strong> <em>Seder HaHaggadah</em> § 21 and <strong>Bach</strong> <em>ad. loc. s.v.</em> ומ\"ש חציה</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <strong>Rav Asher Weiss</strong> said this like it was a known idea. I only found it in <strong>Derashos Chasam Sofer</strong> II p. 306 <em>col.</em> 4 <em>s.v.</em> כתיב, although it probably appears elsewhere</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Like you say, the middle matzah is associated with Yitzchok Avinu.</p>\n\n<p>Kabbalisticly, Yitzchok is associated with the <em>Kav of Gevurah and Judgement</em>. This follows the idea that each of the three Avot correspond to one of the three Kavim. (Avraham to Chesed, Yitzchok to Gevurah and Yaacov to Tiferet)</p>\n\n<p>Part of the Passover seder is related to the idea of <em>Sweetening the Gevurot</em> which is connected with the idea of redemption.</p>\n\n<p>The breaking of the matzah associated with Yitzchok is part of that sweetening process.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to the idea of how Sarah Imanu's name was Sarai, spelled שרי originally. The letter Yud of her name was split in half into two Heh's. One she kept in her name and the other was added to Avram's name making him Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>This change was done at the <em>Covenant between the halves</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.10-14?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 15:10-14</a>) which is also the time when G-d told Avraham about the Egyptian exile and the redemption from it.</p>\n\n<p>It was this change that altered their destiny and made possible the conception and birth of Yitzchok Avinu. Redemption is also associated with the process of birth, like when the Jewish people passed through the Red Sea after departing Mitzrayim, similar to passing through the birth canal.</p>\n\n<p>Each of those two halves of the split matzah correspond to our hands and feet which have five digits. The right hand is associated with kindness, which is why general Jewish practice is to begin all actions with our right. The left with Gevurah.</p>\n\n<p>Gevurah is also the idea of division, like the five parts of the mouth which are the source for the pronunciation of the twenty-two different letters of the Aleph-Bet.</p>\n\n<p>Some, including Chabad, also have the additional practice of breaking the larger of those two halves into five pieces which will ultimately serve as the Afikomen.</p>\n\n\n",

(non-sefard)  I have heard the Rema requires it, are any mattir?</li>\n<li>Can the leader of the seder paraphrase items in maggid - or does each word have to be recited verbatim?  Specifically the many derashos are difficult for most to follow while said inside (w/o zoning out).<br>\n(The Shulchan Aruch OC 473:7 says that after Avadim Hayinu is said then \"וקורא כל ההגדה\" which would make it seem that it's a din in קריאה (reciting).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong>\nMy seder experience (40+ years) has been that when someone goes into \"recital\" mode, all in attendance tune out (true outside of the seder - e.g. does anyone listen to each word of the Shabbos kiddush being \"recited\", it all becomes \"yada, yada, yada, \"Hagefen\" \"Amen - let's drink then eat\"\nGiven the above \"reciting\" does not promote questions/conversation at the seder.  Quite the opposite is squelches it.  Couple that with the requirement to recite it on your own, thus less time to focus on \"hey why Do we do ... tonight?\" and just go into \"read this to discharge my obligation then eat\".\nTo combat this I have tried to have a flowing discussion, where based on the level of those at the seder the ideas in the hagaddah are woven into discussion instead of reciting verbatim.  (I never knew if that's halachically acceptable, so I'm asking now.)\nIn addition, this year we have spouses of my children, who for sure will not agree to such an approach if I don't have a legitimate source to back it up (and even then who knows).\nThe problem with that is that Questions and discussion arise when people see others interested, it some at the seder see others in \"recite then eat\" mode, they will want to follow (a seder seems to follow the Least Common Denominator - i.e. who ever is going to eat first, the rest follow.)  Not to mention, the implied \"you're not actually getting the mitzvah unless you also recite the hagaddah word for word\"\nHence, I'm NOT asking for ideas to spice up the seder, but purely from a halachah point of view, how much leeway is given to gear the seder to those in attendance.

He does <em>lechatchila</em> require the maid to come in for the whole hagada, but the strict halacha would seem to only need the bit about which we say \"לא יָצָא יְדֵי חוֹבָתוֹ\".</p>\n\n<p><em>Note that the CA is talking about Maggid. Kiddush is explicitly required, and he's unclear whether she would have to pick up from the Hallel component of Magid</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Whether your situation would justify adopting such a leniency is doubtful, but there is a clear technical basis for leaving things out.

Unfortunately, the part I wrote about Barak got erased at the time. I have a note I left saying that somehow I'd gotten into my head that Barak may have been from the Tribe of Levi. Yes, I know the most common interpretation of the verse \" וַתִּשְׁלַח, וַתִּקְרָא לְבָרָק בֶּן-אֲבִינֹעַם, מִקֶּדֶשׁ, נַפְתָּלִי\" - \"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali\" (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0704.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 4:6</a>) is that the Tanach makes him out to be of the Tribe of Naftali, but there's also a midrashic text that makes this a bit ambiguous:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.42.5?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach, 42:5</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\"מכל השבטים יצאו שופטים ומלכים ומשבט שמעון לא קם לא שופט ולא מלך בשביל החטא שעשה זמרי בשבטים, ללמדך כמה חמורה הזנות. עתניאל בן קנז משבט יהודה. אהוד משבט בנימין. דבורה וברק מהר אפרים ומקדש נפתלי. גדעון משבט מנשה ואבימלך בנו אחריו, תולע בן פואה משבט יששכר. יאיר הגלעדי מחוות יאיר משבט מנשה. וכן יפתח מיושבי גלעד. אבצן מבית לחם יהודה. אלון משבט זבולון. עבדון בן הלל משבט אפרים. שמשון משבט דן. עלי ושמואל משבט לוי, ומבנימן יצאו מלכים. ומיהודה מלכים. ומאפרים ירבעם. וממנשה יהוא בן נמשי. אבל שמעון לא העמיד לא שופט ולא מלך בשביל עון הזנות, לפיכך נתנה תורה ברית מילה בערוה שיהא יראת המקום מונעת מלעשות החטא.\"</p>\n\n<p>Translation:</p>\n\n<p>\"From all the Tribes there rose judges and kings and from the Tribe of Shimon there didn't rise not a judge nor a king...\" - </p>\n\n<p>Then the midrash proceeds to list off seemingly judges and kings from all the tribes, except not really. The midrash does not cite rulers from the following tribes (besides Shimon): Reuven, Gad, Asher.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the language the midrash uses is strange: For most of the leaders, it outright says so and so was from such and such a tribe. But in the case Dvorah and Barak, it merely states they were from places in the territories of those tribes and doesn't explicitly state they were of those tribes.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I was wondering if anyone knows of any source that states something along this line of thought I had? Not specifically that Barak was from Levi, but that he may not have been from Naftali?</p>\n\n\n",

Also, it is not just a matter of carrying with no eruv.this is discussed in <a href=\"https://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2009/10/not-shaking-lulav-on-shabbat.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Not Shaking the Lulav on Shabbat</a>. As Rashi explains, if communities with an eruv start bringing the lulav to shul, they would be violating the takanah of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai and would actually be destroying the unity of klal Yisrael. We do not have a Sanhedrin that can rule to overturn this takkanah. Hopefully, bimheirah beyameinu, the mashiach will come, we will have a rebuilt Bais Hamikdash and we can then follow the rules specified in the talmud for bringing the lulav to the Bais Hamikdash.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai (a resident of the land of Israel)\n  instituted, following the destruction of the Second Temple, that\n  certain mitzvot, lulav among them, not be observed on the Shabbat. His\n  concern was that one who is not knowledgeable in the required practice\n  may carry a ritual object (in this case a lulav, but similar\n  enactments were made for a shofar and a megillat Esther) in the public\n  domain, which would be a torah-level desecration of the Shabbat. While\n  a lulav is “muktzeh” nowadays on Shabbat, this is due to Rabbi Yohanan\n  ben Zakkai’s decree (which rendered a lulav useless on Shabbat), and\n  is not, as Louis mistakenly understands, the reason for the decree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the decree was made to apply even if there was an eruv, the lulav is muktzah on Shabbos just like a shofar.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After the Talmud describes the different practices of Diaspora Jewry\n  and those in Israel in regard to lulav, it continues with a separate,\n  but related, topic, and then discusses the custom of waving a willow\n  branch, which was instituted as a commemoration of a similar practice\n  performed in the Temple during the Sukkot holiday. The discussion\n  concludes that just as a willow was not waved in the Diaspora, the\n  communities in Israel refrained from doing so as well. This seems to\n  be in direct contrast to the practice of taking the lulav, where the\n  communities in the Diaspora and the land of Israel had different\n  practices. The Talmud admits that a mistake had been made with regard\n  to lulav, and concludes that the communities of the land of Israel did\n  indeed refrain from taking a lulav, even on the first day of the\n  holiday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>continuing</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Second, once the mistake has been corrected, it is clear that the Jews\n  of Israel did not take the lulav on Shabbat. Rather, as noted above,\n  they ceased this practice following the destruction of the Second\n  Temple, at the behest of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, who lived in\n  Israel. Thus, the practice in the land of Israel since the time of the\n  destruction of the Second Temple seems to have been to refrain from\n  taking the lulav on the first day of Sukkot if it coincides with\n  Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>Finally, there is no imposition of any worldviews. The Jews of Babylon\n  did not dictate that Jews in Israel should not take their lulavim on\n  the first day of the holiday if it falls on Shabbat. Rather, it is\n  clear from the language of the Talmud they merely described the\n  existing reality.</p>\n  \n  <p>Significantly, on this last point, Rashi (who is recognized as the\n  premier contributor to Biblical and Talmudic exegesis, and whose\n  comments are generally assumed to reflect the most straightforward\n  understanding of a text) explains that the reason that the Jews of the\n  land of Israel changed their practice was to prevent the breakdown of\n  the Jewish people into separate groups – indeed to promote Jewish\n  unity. This is consistent with the tone throughout the entire corpus\n  of the Talmud, which describes the open lines of communication between\n  the Jews of Babylonia and those living in the land of Israel, and in\n  fact the respect and reverence shown by the former toward the latter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>An eruv is no better than one's own house.\nWhen Rav Yochanan ben Zakkai made the takana, he could have made it that everyone should take the lulav in their house before coming to shul.</p>\n\n<p>But we see that he was concerned that there might be one person who needed help, and would thus leave his house to ask for help in a forbidden way. It's a far-fetched concern, but clearly Rav YbZ was extremely cautious about potential chillul Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Thus even when most people live with an eruv, we are still concerned about that individual who would carry without one.</p>\n\n<p>(Many of the people who lack a strong Jewish background, and thus would be likely to need to ask for help and be at risk for carrying, also live in small Jewish communities without eruvim.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I remember seeing another answer- it was a long time ago and I don't remember the source or how reputable it is.</p>\n\n<p>The suggestion is that Rav YbZ was extremely concerned that people should remember the beis hamikdosh.\nTherefore, he made \"extreme\" takonos which would reinforce this, and make sure we keep it in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it's not just a question of \"for the far-fetched chance that someone will break Shabbos to carry the lulav to ask how to take it, it's worth millions of Jews throughout the generations not fulfilling their mitzvah?\"</p>\n\n<p>It's also making sure that millions of Jews will remember the beis hamikdash and daven for Hashem to make us worthy of it.</p>\n\n<p>That's actually the context of the gemara in Sukkah (and rosh hashana-same exact gemara.) The gemara say that the obligation to make \"Zecher lamikdash\" is from a verse \"ein doresh lah\"- the Jews are criticized since they are not \"doresh\" Zion, they don't seek it out. The gemara concludes that we see an obligation to \"seek out\" Zion, to make remembrances.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, <strong>זרוע</strong> is an <strong>outstretched arm</strong> while <strong>צרוע</strong> is the <strong>inner rot blossoming externally</strong> on one's skin in the form of tzara'as. (That is the connection between זרוע and צרוע. is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&sxsrf=ALeKk02xpWQuSZof43NGGiTqfifsDTD7XA%3A1586658252329&source=hp&ei=zHuSXu7REJOxytMPldCH0AI&q=%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A2%20translate&oq=%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A2%20translate&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQoAE6BggAEAoQEzoECAAQEzoICAAQChAeEBM6CggAEAUQChAeEBM6BAgAEAE6BggAEAoQAToICAAQChABECpKIQgXEh00LTE2MGcyMjlnMTIzZzExMmcxNTFnMTQ2ZzEyNEoTCBgSDzQtMWcxZzFnMWcxZzFnNFCaAljcE2DCFGgAcAB4AIABywGIAa4KkgEFMC45LjGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwju54bM6uHoAhWTmHIEHRXoASoQ4dUDCAg&uact=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not</a> translated as an outstretched arm.</p>\n\n<p>If you are asking what the connection is between the shankbone of the Pesach seder plate and the outstretched arm, they are both called זרוע, and you are correct in noting their connection as the shankbone symbolizes Hashem taking us out of Egypt with an outstretched hand. Hence, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.136.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim (136:12</a>) says בְּיָ֣ד חֲ֭זָקָה <strong>וּבִזְר֣וֹע</strong>ַ נְטוּיָ֑ה - with an <strong>outstretched hand</strong> (or zeroa/shankbone) He took us out.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Matityahu Clark, in expanding on the Hirschian system of phonemic cognates, discusses (see Appendix B) phonemic class E30, which I would summarize as a collection of triliteral roots where the first letter is a sibilant, the second letter is <em>resh</em>, and the third letter is a guttural. This is what NJM referred to in his/her answer. Here is a picture of this phonemic class, from my <a href=\"http://www.mivami.org/dictionary/clark/%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%A2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblical Thesaurus website</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h7ZcH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/h7ZcH.png\" alt=\"Clark phonemic class E30\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this picture, both צרע (erupt) and זרע (cast out) appear. Clark (following Hirsch) discusses a \"cognate meaning\", that is, the meaning associated with the entire class. The cognate meaning he gives (in the entry for צרע on page 222) is \"project outward\".</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, as mentioned in the comments on your question, the word \"outstretched arm\" is actually זרוע with a zayin, just like the זרוע which is the bone on the seder plate. The צ does not appear in either word. Yes, these are etymologically related. The part of the animal, the shank (and thus shankbone), is parallel to the arm of a person. See this image of a beef shank:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tsBeR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tsBeR.png\" alt=\"shank cut of meat\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Metaphorically, God showed might with an \"outstretched zeroah / arm\".</p>\n\n\n",

For example:\n(Shemos 7:14) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונתתי את ידי במצרים\n  I put my hand in Egypt\n  (Shemos 13:9) \n  ביד חזקה הוציאך \n  He took you out with a strong hand\n  And even by the plague of pestilence itself it says (Shemos 9:3)\n  הנה יד יי הויה במקנך...\n  Behold God's hand is against your cattle...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So how can Rabbi Yosi HaGlili say that the plagues in Egypt were only a \"finger\" if the above three Pesukim say they were a \"hand\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Haflaa (Rabbi Pinchas HaLevi Horowitz, av\"d Frankfurt) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Ten_Plagues?lang=bi&p2=Peirush_Hafla%27ah_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Ten_Plagues.18.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">asks your question</a>. In summary he explains that really all <strong>five fingers were used for the ten plagues, but only one \"etzba\" at a time</strong>. So since for Kinim the 3rd plague the 2nd finger (etzba) was used, the thumb must have already been used for the first 2 plagues, 2nd finger 3rd and 4th plague 3rd finger 5th and 6th plague etc. until the every finger was used for the 10 plagues.</p>\n\n<p>So really the hand that was used at the sea was the same hand used for the 10 Makkos.\nBut the hand <strong>at the sea the \"Yad Hagedola\" all 5 fingers were used at the same time</strong>. This can be explained:</p>\n\n<p>\"Five of you shall give chase to a hundred and a hundred shall give chase to ten thousands.”Leviticus 26:8 Commenting on this Rashi writes: “Is this then the correct proportions? Should it not have said and a hundred shall give chase to two thousand? However one cannot compare the few who keep the Torah to the many who keep the Torah.” This is so because the ones who keep the Torah help one another. 100:10,000 which is <strong>when the many help each other they are 5 times stronger than the few</strong> 5:100 (which is the same as 100:2,000).             </p>\n\n<p>So too Rabbi Yossi Hagellili learnt from the Blessings in Bechukosai that \"Yad hachazaka\" the strong hand at the sea where all the fingers were together helping each other, was 5 times stronger than the individual fingers on their own. <strong>So the individual fingers made 10 plagues where as the collective hand made 50 plagues</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For those that  want to see the whole excerpt:<br>\n אך קשה הא כתיב ונתתי את ידי במצרים וכתיב ביד חזקה הוציאך הרי דגם במצרים לקו ביד ועוד נראה דהא אצבע אלהים היא הוא מכת כנים ועיין פירש״י שם נמצא שאין הכתובים סותרים זא״ז די״ל שלקו בכל אצבע שתי מכות נמצא בגודל לקו שתי מכות דם צפרדע ובכנים לקו באצבע הסמוך לגודל ובו לקו ג״כ מכת ערוב וכך בכל אצבע שני מכות והיינו דכתיב ונתתי את ידי במצרים נמצא קשה על ריה״ג מנ״ל דעל הים לקו חמשה פעמים כמו במצרים ונראה לפרש ע״פ מה שאמרו חז״ל והביאו רש״י ז״ל בפסוק ורדפו מכם חמשה מאה כו׳ וכי כן הוא החשבון והנה לא היה צריך לומר אלא מאה שני אלפים ירדופו אלא אינו דומה חמשה שרודפים למאה רודפים דהיינו משום שהם מסייען זא״ז וכמ״ש בחידושי כתובות דף ה׳ אהא דקאמר שם גדול עשה לצדיקים יותר ממעשה שמים וארץ דאלו בשמים וארץ כתיב ידי יסדה ארץ וימני טפחה שמים ואלו במעשה צדיקים כתיב מקדש ה׳ כוננו ידיך והיינו שני ידים שמסייעין זא״ז וא״כ ה״נ דאף בידו יסדה ארץ היינו יד שמאל הרי דגם מעשה שמים וארץ היה בשתי ידים אלא אינו דומה שהיה כל אחת ביד אחת ולא הי׳ מסייעין זא״ז משא״כ במעשה צדיקים כוננו ידיך והיינו שתי ידים שמסייעין זא״ז וא״כ ה״נ כיון דביד לקו בכל היד יחד אינו דומה למכת מצרים שהיה בכל אצבע בפני עצמה ולא היה מסייעין אצבעות זה לזה וכיון דמצינו גבי ורדפו מכם חמשה מאה במרובין המסייעין זא״ז הוא כפול חמשה פעמים שהרי לא היה צריך לומר אלא שני אלפים וכתיב רבבה דהוא עשרת אלפים למד ריה״ג מזה דעל הים לקו חמשה פעמים כמו במצרים</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Bamidbar 35:33 contradict the Torah concerning man-slayers?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I don’t speak Hebrew and have only read Bamidbar 35 in English translations. The JPS Tanakh renders verse 33 as ‘You shall not pollute the land in which you live; for blood pollutes the land, and the land can have no expiation for blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it.’ To my English ears this sounds as if Hashem is contradicting His own law concerning accidental killers. The English phrase ‘blood that is shed’ implies nothing about the motives of the blood-shedder. The translation as a whole implies, in English, that a man-slayer ought to be killed. Is this a case of misleading translation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You should note that the previous verses give the halacha of both the intentional murderer and the accidental murderer. The <em>pesukim</em> also give the halacha that one cannot attempt to pardon a murderer (intentional or accidental) from the appropriate punishment. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9963/showrashi/true#v31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ms'ei 35:31-32</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>31 You shall not accept ransom for the life of a murderer, who is\n  guilty of death, for he shall be put to death.</p>\n  \n  <p>32 You shall not accept ransom for one who has fled to his city of\n  refuge, to allow him to return to live in the Land, before the kohen\n  has died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates <em>pasuk</em> 33 as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And ye shall not make the land in which ye are into a hypocrite, for\n  blood, it maketh the land into a hypocrite, and for the land there is\n  no atonement for the blood that is shed in it except by the blood of\n  him that shed it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus not punishing either type of killing appropriately will <em>pollute</em> or <em>corrupt</em> the land. Such an action in either case causes the land to require the redemption of the blood that was spilled.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חנף, as is definitely clear in its use in Job and Proverbs means: to\n  play the hypocrite, to put on an air of piety; to present an\n  appearance externally which by no means corresponds to the inner\n  reality. So that he who makes a man into a hypocrite takes away the\n  inner kernel leaving the outer appearance unchanged. </p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p>Now it says: ולא תחניפו את הארץ, if you tolerate intentional murder\n  and careless manslaughter, then you make the land אשר אתם בו in which\n  you <em>are</em> (not merely אשר אתם יושבים בה as in V34), in which your\n  earthly existence has its roots, which is to see it noblest product in\n  you, you make the land into a \"hypocrite\". It deceives the expectation\n  which otherwise you are justified in entertaining from it, it keeps\n  back the blessing that should flow out from it, \"כִּ֣י הַדָּ֔ם ה֥וּא\n  יַֽחֲנִ֖יף אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ\", for blood, human blood is the noblest fruit\n  that the land matures, and innocent blood spilt makes the land into a\n  \"hypocrite\".</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p>this חנופה of the land is only purged when the innocent blood which\n  has been spilt, and the human being whose existence down here has been\n  brought to an end thereby, finds a champion, amongst the human society\n  which goes on living after it, to take up its cause, and the murderer\n  atones for his existence down here which was forfeited by the murderer\n  by being killed by that champion of the murder. For by shedding the\n  blood of his brother-man, his own blood has lost its justification, he\n  himself had forfeited the right to go on living; and tolerating the\n  further continuing living on of one who has deliberately and with\n  foresight murdered a fellow-man, is an insult to and derision of  the\n  higher dignity of the conception of Man being near God, is a breach of\n  the contract under which God gave the earth to Man, under which God\n  had given the land to Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The case of <em>accidental</em> death has to be explained specifically because the person who negligently causes someone else's death cannot be allowed to go completely free. His actions did cause someone else's death but while it was without intent, he should have taken care to ensure that the circumstance did not take place. Thus the blood of the dead person must be atoned for and he must show that there is an element of guilt. That is why both verses 31 and 32 are written.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>What you're saying is theoretically true, but there's no contradiction. It's not so much a mistranslation as an incomplete one.\nDirect translation minus the explanation can be misleading.</p>\n<p>First off, remember that even a negligent murderer can be killed, by the \"blood redeemers\" i.e. members of the victims family, as a result of his crime. He is given the ability/obligation to flee to a city of refuge to save his life; but if he leaves there, he is a dead man!</p>\n<p>Now here's the explanation of the Chizkuni, one of the earlier commentators, explaining the verse (translation is from Sefaria, link's here <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.35.33?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Numbers.35.33.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא תחניפו את הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>, “this verse is to be understood at face value, i.e. “you shall not flatter the land;” this is a warning for wealthy people who had become guilty of the death penalty not to be allowed to plead to a lesser charge, and to make generous financial restitution to the party whom they had harmed or to the family of that person.\n'כי הדם הוא הוא יחניף וגו, “for the blood spilled <strong>(and not atoned for)</strong> would contaminate” the soil of the Holy Land. This is why G-d warns us not to contaminate the land he has given us by allowing bloodshed to go unpunished according to the principle of נפש תחת נפש, “a life for a life,” a principle spelled out already in Genesis 9,6, a principle applicable to all of mankind.</p>\n<p>(I bolded the extra words of explanation which he adds, which clarifies it a bit.)</p>\n<p>Put this in context with the previous verse which allow for no monetary restitution to take the place of execution (for an intentional murderer) or exile (for a negligent one.)</p>\n<p>Allowing a murderer to walk around free, while his victim's blood is in the ground, would contaminate it.\nThus we must keep murderers off the land- either by killing them or locking them in cities of refuge, depending on the crime.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't mean that we are supposed to kill negligent murderers. Thus there's no contradiction.</p>\n\n\n",

'And the measure of my days, what it is'-'it is a decree before Me that a person's span [of life] is not made known.' 'Let me know how frail [hadel] I am.'  Said He to him. 'Thou wilt die on the Sabbath.' 'Let me die on the first day of the week!' 'The reign of thy son Solomon shall already have become due, and one reign may not overlap another even by a hairbreadth.' 'Then let me die on the eve of the Sabbath!' Said He, 'For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand': better is to Me the one day that thou sittest and engagest in learning than the thousand burnt-offerings which thy son Solomon is destined to sacrifice before Me on the altar.' Now, every Sabbath day he would sit and study all day.  On the day that his soul was to be at rest,  the Angel of death stood before him but could not prevail against him, because learning did not cease from his mouth. 'What shall I do to him?' said he. Now, there was a garden before his house; so the Angel of death went, ascended and soughed in the trees. He [David] went out to see: as he was ascending the ladder, it broke under him. Thereupon he became silent [from his studies] and his soul had repose.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_30.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God clearly told David that he would die on Shabbat. Yet David attempted to save himself by always studying Torah all Shabbat. How could he have thought that he could outsmart God and keep himself alive?</p>\n<p>This is all the more astounding because it's not just that God told him that he would die on Shabbat (in which case you might think that it was not set in stone and could perhaps be changed). David specifically asked God to alter the plan and God explicitly told David that He would under no circumstances alter the plan, as King Solomon's reign could not be pushed off even for a moment. And in fact, as the story shows, David's plan did not succeed.</p>\n<p>Knowing all this, what did King David think he could actually accomplish by studying Torah all Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>We can learn from Brachot 10a:</p>\n\n<p>“Son of Amotz, stop your prophesying and leave! I have a tradition from my grandfather’s house [i.e., from King David]: Even if a sharp sword is placed over one’s neck, one should not refrain from praying for mercy.”</p>\n\n<p>So it is not surprising that David prayed for more life even when the decree was passed against him.</p>\n\n<p>For God might have given him more years of life just as he did to Hezekiah.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Moses did the same thing, pleading with God to let him enter Eretz Yisrael even though he had already been told he would not enter. Moses only stopped when God forbade him from praying any longer.</p>\n\n\n",

There’s just a perfect correlation between fins/scales and being kosher.</p>\n<h2>Guide for the Perplexed 3:48</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The characteristics given in the Law (Lev. xi., and Deut. xiv.) of the permitted animals, viz., chewing the cud and divided hoofs for cattle, and fins and scales for fish, are in themselves neither the cause of the permission when they are present, nor of the prohibition when they are absent; but merely signs by which the recommended species of animals can be discerned from those that are forbidden.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maybe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/137607/jewish/Fins-and-Scales.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this idea</a> about the symbolism of fins and scales from the Lubavitcher Rebbe can help:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the armor that protects the body of the fish, scales represent the quality of integrity, which protects us from the many pitfalls that life presents. A man of integrity will not deceive his customers, in spite of the financial profits involved. He will not lie to a friend, despite the short-term gain from doing so. He will not cheat on his wife, in the face of tremendous temptation. Integrity means that one has absolute standards of right and wrong and is committed to a morality that transcends one’s moods and desires. Integrity preserves our souls from temptation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Fins, the wing-like organs that propel fish forward, represent ambition. A healthy sense of ambition, knowing one’s strengths and wanting to utilize them in full, gives a person the impetus to traverse the turbulent sea of life and to maximize his or her G‑d-given potential. It propels us to fulfill our dreams and leave our unique imprint on the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I understood that the reason is because the original owner had ye'ush (gave up hope). Seemingly that makes the item hefker (ownerless). So a new person can own this item.\nBut we know that a minor can't Halachically transfer ownership of an item he owns. Like we see by the Lulav and Esrog, that if you give them to a minor, then the minor aquires it but can't give it back to you. You're stuck with him owning it.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: What happens if a minor owns an object and loses it, and this is an object that's allowed to be kept because the owner gives up hope. (and let's say you can tell that this object belonged to a minor. e.g. it's a kid-sized object.) So if a minor doesn't have the da'as or ability to make Halachic actions, then it would seem that his ye'ush (giving up hope) doesn't work on the object. So if a child's object never had Halachic ye'ush, is this object not allowed to be kept?</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: If a Katan can't be mafkir or meya'esh (like we see by Dalet Minim), then it seems his aveidah should be chayiv lehachriz.

    "content": "# Rav Kook's interpretation of the \"wise Gentiles\" in Mishneh Torah-Hilchot Melachim 8:11\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian  Noahide </p>\n\n<p>As it is known, in Hilchot Melachim 8:11  Rambam states:</p>\n\n<p><em>“Anyone (Gentile) who accepts upon himself the fulfillment of these seven mitzvot and is precise in their observance is considered one of “the Righteous among the Gentiles”, and he will merit a share in the World To Come.\nThis applies when he accepts them and fulfills them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and informed us through Moses, our Teacher, that Noah's descendants had been commanded to fulfill them previously.\nHowever, if he fulfills them out of intellectual conviction, he is not a “gher toshav”, nor one of “the Righteous among the Gentiles”, nor/but one of their wise men”.</em></p>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, the orientation prevalent today among Jewish and non-Jewish scholars is to read \"but one the their wise man\", in accordance with the lectio present in the Yemeni manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah, and not \"nor one of their wise men \". Except for my mistake, the rabbis and the scholars maintain however that,according to Rambam, these \"wise Gentiles\"will be rewarded by HaShem during their lifetime,  but they will have no part in the World to Come, in line with what appears to be the source used by Maimonides in this passage, namely\" Pirkei de Rabbi Eliezer \".</p>\n\n<p>However, I have found this fascinating comment written on this passage by the authoritative Rav Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook,according to whom Rambam believes that the \"wise Gentiles\" even have a higher status than the \"Righteous among the Nations\":</p>\n\n<p><em>“Behold the correct version is \"but (ela) one of their wise men.My opinion is that the intent of Maimonides is that the status \"meriting a share in the World to Come\" is a very low level, even though it is also a great good. Since, however, even Jewish sinners and ignoramuses merit this status, it is a low status amongst spiritual values. Maimonides reasons that ideas improve man much more than does righteous behavior. Therefore he reasons that the level of \"meriting a share in the World to Come,\" is a status specifically for Righteous Gentiles, who were not superior in their ideas but accepted faith in whole- hearted purity and acted in an honest way because they accepted that their commandments were so given by God. However, he who through his rational conclusion merited acquiring the seven Noahide commandments, he is truly wise of heart and full of understanding. He is considered \"of their wise men,\" for the status of wisdom is very great, and there is no need to state that they \"will merit a share in the World to Come.\" Rather he stands on a level of holiness (kedusha) that requires interpretation in an expression greater than the language of \"meriting  a share in the World to Come.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Is this peculiar exegesis of Rav Kook regarding Rambam's position a subject of a specific study in the Jewish world?</p>\n\n\n",

We should always make our prayers more sincere and heartfelt.</p>\n\n<p>Should all Jews be making special programs and events (for example, like in MetLife Stadium) for bringing Moshiach? The answer is that if we knew that this is what’s holding up the coming of the Messiah, we would surely do so. However the notion that the making of Moshiach rallies will hasten his coming; is debatable.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of hastening the Messiah’s revelation, is dealt with here\n<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40607/do-we-have-to-bring-mashiach/\">Do we have to bring Mashiach?</a></p>\n\n<p>I note <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40607/do-we-have-to-bring-mashiach/112095#112095\">there, that</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We see that there has been a long standing debate regarding the\n  question of, is action required on our part to help bring the future\n  redemption.

Contrast this with the current Lubavitcher approach, which\n  is to attempt to hasten the final redemption, and their mission is\n  centered on this goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Rabbi M.M. Schneerson was alive, there was a strong movement in Lubavitch to recognize him as the Jewish Messiah. The debate whether or not Rabbi Schneerson himself hinted to his alleged status, or if it was merely his followers who proclaimed so, is moot. The point is, that the lives of Lubavitchers revolved around a Messianic culture, and they believed that the Rebbe’s “coming” was imminent, and all they needed to do was help hasten his revelation. Which is why at the time, Lubavitch was “very into Moshiach”, since they felt that the Rebbe was counting on them to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>After Rabbi M.M. Schneerson’s passing, most Torah Jews recognized that he isn’t the Jewish Messiah, since the potential Messiah is a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/112093/does-mashiach-know-who-he-is/112094#112094\">live human, living among us today</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the Hebrew Bible makes NO mention about the Messiah failing to fulfill ALL the essential Messianic passages, and will have to return in the future to do so. If an individual fails to fulfill even one of these conditions, then he cannot have been the Messiah, which is why Torah Jews can never accept the Messiahship of any personality, however noble or well-intended, who died without ushering in the age of physical redemption. </p>\n\n<p>Those who continue to insist that Rabbi M.M. Schneerson is the Messiah, are regarded as a breakaway Messianic sect, and are therefore shunned by mainstream Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Because their Rebbe told them to focus on it.</p>\n\n<p>However the Rambam discourages people from focusing on the details of what will happen and when.</p>\n\n<p>see\nHilchos melachim 12:2\n the principle is simple \"אֶלָּא יְחַכֶּה ויַאֲמִין בִּכְלַל הַדָּבָר\". </p>\n\n<p>there isnt much to talk about at an event without getting into details</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All Orthodox  Jews daven for and eagerly await   Mashiach but there are limits in how great of a focus and innovative methods we can make to bring it.</p>\n<p>After the Gemora Kesubos 111A talks about the \"three oaths\" it then mentions the \"six oaths\" that Klal Yisroel swore.

However, at least some of those sources seem to understand that there is no <em>mitzvah</em> to eat <em>matzah</em> on the other days (see <strong>Birkei Yosef</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> 475:6 who discusses if the <strong>Ba'al HaMeor</strong> holds that you fulfill a <em>mitzvah</em> on the other days or not). If so, why is that according to the <strong>Vilna Gaon</strong> there isn't a blessing, since there is in fact a <em>mitzvah</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, they bring from the <strong>Sedei Chemed</strong> (Ma'aracha Choshen Mishpat 14:10) that there are those who are accustomed <strong>to in fact</strong> make a blessing all seven days. Also, <strong>Rav Shlomo HaKohen</strong> from Vilna wrote a letter to the <strong>Sedei Chemed</strong> saying that according to the <strong>Vilna Gaon</strong>, there should be a blessing (but writes צ\"ע). They also bring that there's a letter from the <strong>Netziv</strong> that discusses similarly.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, they bring from <strong>Teshuvos Maharsham</strong> 1:209 that even according to the <strong>Vilna Gaon</strong> there's only a blessing the first night.</p>\n\n<p>I looked up the <strong>Maharsham</strong>, and he brings that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Responsa_Chatam_Sofer%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.191.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Teshuvos Chasam Sofer</strong></a> (Yoreh Deah 191) brings from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni,_Exodus.12.18.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Chizkuni</strong></a> like the <strong>Vilna Gaon</strong>, that there's a <em>mitzvah</em> all seven days, just not an obligation.

To briefly summarize, he explains that the commandment on the first night is to eat <em>matzah</em> for the inherentness of <em>matzah</em>, whereas the commandment for the rest of the holiday is to eat <em>matzah</em> to show that you are not eating <em>chametz</em>. Based on this distinction he lists various situations where one would be obligated in the first-night <em>matzah</em> but could exempt himself from the rest-of-the-holiday <em>matzah</em>.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

If <em>timtum halev</em> is simply a reality independent from <em>issur</em> status then nothing should have changed once the Rabbis forbade something. There doesn’t seem to be a reason why they would inject new <em>timtum halev</em> into something (assuming they could), which leaves us with the possibility that things caused <em>timtum halev</em> even when they were entirely permissible. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rashba in Yevamos 114 notes that there is an idea of timtum even by something technically permissible. Tosfos in Avoda Zara 10b also brings the idea of timtum by the story of Rebbi and Antinonos that Rebbis mother nursed Antinos and that inspired him to learn Torah later on.

    "content": "# I will descend to Sodom and Amorah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 18:21</a> G-d seems to say something like: I will descend now and see, whether according to her cry, which has come to Me, they have done.</p>\n<p>Did He really descend right at that moment in time or somewhere before or after He talked to Avraham about His plans?</p>\n<p>And where did He went to after He departed from Avraham in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.33?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 18:33</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The approach of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.1?lang=bi&with=Rashbam&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> to the whole chapter is that (almost) every reference to Hashem is a reference to the angel who He sent \"in his name\" to visit Avraham:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וירא אליו ה' - האיך? שבאו אליו שלשה אנשים שהיו מלאכים, שבהרבה מקומות כשנראה המלאך קוראו בלשון שכינה, כדכתיב: כי שמי בקרבו שלוחו כמותו. וכן: וירא מלאך ה' אליו בלבת אש מתוך הסנה. וכתוב שם: וירא ה' כי סר לראות.</p>\n<p>(1) ADONAI APPEARED TO HIM. How? In that three men came to him who were angels. For in many places where an angel appears, it refers to him in language of Sh'china [divinity], as it is written (Ex. 23:20-21) \"[I am sending an angel] ... since My Name is in him\" -- His messenger is like Him. Similarly (Ex. 3:2)), \"An angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush\" and it is written there (v.4), \"When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to look ....\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, after the angel finished speaking with Avraham, he went down to Sedom like he said he would, and like it says in the next verse that the angles arrived.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question \"can G-d descend?\" is a little like the question \"is G-d anthropomorphic?\" since the former implies that G-d is a body. For clarity, I will address the question of whether G-d descends, but it will also encompasses some of the latter.</p>\n\n<p>Did G-d have to descend to investigate a matter in Genesis 18:20 and 21? </p>\n\n<p>A literal reading of the Bible thinks so:</p>\n\n<p>“G-d said, ‘the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their misdeeds are very grievous. I will go down now and see whether they acted as [indicated in] the cry that has come up to me, then I will destroy them, if not I will know.’”[1]</p>\n\n<p>The phrase, \"if not I will know\" is obscure. The simple reading has G-d wondering if He heard correctly, to clarify this, G-d will descend and investigate what is really happening. The prior phrase states that if He discovers that the people did not act properly, he will “destroy them.” G-d concludes “if not,” meaning that they were righteous, then “I will know” this and not harm them. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/Vol7Slifkinwithletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> supports the notion of a corporeal deity descending when he portrays G-d anthropomorphically. Scripture states: “G-d came down to see the city\nand the tower that the people built [the Tower of Babel].”</p>\n\n<p>Regarding both stories, the Midrash Tanchuma asks “Does G-d need to descend and see?” it asks. “Isn’t everything known before Him?”</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash explains these stories to be a figure of speech. It informs judges not to make a decision only after a brief insufficient investigation. G-d is all-knowing and all-powerful and does not need to descend to hear or prove anything. Additionally, Onkelos substitutes the anthropomorphic “I will go down” to “I will reveal Myself.” There is nothing that G-d does not already know, He is certainly not taking a trip to learn about circumstances in which He has no prior knowledge. Rather, He is  “revealing,” informing them that He is reacting to the evil done. In his commentary to Exodus 19:20, 33:21 and 34:5, Abraham ibn Ezra paraphrases Onkelos and Midrash. In his Guide of the Perplexed 1:10, Maimonides explains the terms “go down” and “go up” is metaphorical, meaning that \"going up\" indicates that divine revelation is taking place and \"go down\" means the communication has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides adds in Guide of the Perplexed 2:45 that all biblical prophecies, with the exception of Moses, were dreams. He writes on 1:10 that G-d's descent is a figure of speech, indicating that the divine decree to render punishment has been acted. Thus, Maimonides says that chapter 18, like the Akedah story, never took place. It was a dream. Abraham dreamed about a conversation with G-d, who descended in anthropomorphic terms. Maimonides will generally recast a biblical story as a prophecy. This greatly angered Nachmanides, who insisted that the stories in the Bible were true events. It could be argued that the Rambam's interpretations greatly diminished the historical significance of the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>[1] We will not address the part of the story where Abraham attempts to argue with G-d over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. But we will add that the notion that humans can influence G-d to change His mind seems problematic, as it suggests that an all-knowing G-d is not altogether wise and that humans can sometimes have a better understanding of the situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Of course, Hashem is omniscient and omnipresent but the torah speaks in the language of mankind so that it speaks in the way that Avraham perceived matters. When he no longers perceives the <em>presence</em> of Hashem in as immediate and direct a fashion, it is as if Hashem had left to go and judge Sodom. Thus, since Avraham was <em>still standing</em> before Hashem it is as if Hashem delayed <em>descending</em> to judge Sodom until after Avraham had finished speaking to Him. That is at <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/jewish/Chapter-18.htm/showrashi/true#v33\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 18:33</a></p>\n\n<p>As Rashi says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>And the Lord departed, etc.</strong>: Since the defender was silent, the Judge left.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>and Abraham returned to his place:</strong> The Judge left, the defender left, and the prosecutor is accusing. Therefore: “And the two angels\n  came to Sodom,” to destroy (Gen. Rabbah 49:14). One to destroy Sodom\n  and one to save Lot, and he [the latter] is the same one who came to\n  heal Abraham, but the third one, who came to announce [Isaac’s birth]\n  to Sarah, since he had performed his mission, he departed (Tan. Vayera\n  8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 18:22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the men turned from there and went to Sodom, and Abraham was still\n  standing before the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>for with all his activity in exercising hospitality Abraham had not\n  gone away from the עמידה לפני ה to which he had been called by the\n  \"appearance\" of God recorded in the first verse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 18:20-21</a> as one compound sentence</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>20: And God said: Even if the outcry over Sodom and Gemorah is greast,\n  and their sin weighs exceedingly heavy,</p>\n  \n  <p>21: I will still go down and see whether, in accordance with the cry\n  which hath come to Me, they have achived complete destruction; and if\n  not I will discriminate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the time of Migdal Bavel, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noah 11:5</a> Rav Hirsch explains the purpose of using the term ירד in te relation of Man and Hashem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>5: And God came down to see the city and the tower which the Sons of Man built.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וירד occurs here for the first time. When we consider that עיקר שכינה\n  בתחתונים, then וירד always designates such a crisis in the development\n  of world affairs that God intervenes to prevent the gap between heaven\n  and earth becoming larger. It brings the world a step nearer to the\n  goal where the שכינה can again stay בתחתונים. But here וירד stands out\n  in bold relief much more pointedly. The state, the community will not\n  allow the individual any other supreme lord than itself. But just as\n  this is an attack on the priceless worth of every individual, which is\n  not just transferred to him through the total worth of the community,\n  and whose value can never be reckoned in a brick, even if that brick\n  is part of the building of the national glory; so is it an attack on\n  God, Who calls every man directly to His service, and thereby makes every man,\n  prince or slave, equal and free. The Name Hashem tolerates no slave!\n  Now in the moment where the community of mankind instead of summoning\n  every individual <em>Beshem Hashem</em> places its own name in the place of\n  God's then וירד ה, God interfers, does not let the world go on, comes\n  down to \"see\" the communal building of mankind, i.e. with the\n  intention on testing the purpose of it. (About anthropomorphism see 0n\n  CH. VI,6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, towns Sodom and Gomorrah placed themselves as the supreme ruler of the thoughts of Man and his <em>moral</em> determination. So too Hashem had to <em>go down</em> in order to determine if they had placed themselves in such a destructive position that even more than the Tower of Bavel, they had totally caused themselves to be removed from the world in order to allow the rest of the world to continue to grow. Alternatively, if there were people who had maintained the strength to resist the evil influences around them (which was not the case), then Hashem would discriminate the differences in the morality of the inhabitants of Sodom and mitigate the punishment of those that deserved a lesser sentence. As Rav Hirsch explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two alternatives were announced to Abraham for the threatened fate of\n  Sodom, כלה: complete destruction, or ידיעה: punishment of the guilty\n  but allowing the whole to continue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This major judgement required Hashem's direct intervention to prevent the total destruction of the world which could have been the final result. Indeed as Rashi points out that this type of judgement requires an immediate and <em>personal</em> judging of the circumstances. We use this language so that when we <em>judge</em> we must take a lesson from the wording in the torah and the anthopomorphic statement of Hashem's <em>actions</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Aruch is <strong>not</strong> saying that standing would have been an expression of freedom, but we don't want to impose, so we don't require that expression of freedom, which is what the English I cited is saying. Rather, the accurate translation is:</p>\n<p>\"<strong>Since</strong> all the acts of the night are a way of expressing freedom, <strong>therefore</strong> we don't require him to stand.\"</p>\n<p>Standing would generally be a requirement for Hallel, not a requirement for freedom.</p>\n<p>In terms of leaning being a tircha, that is a separate question. We don't really \"lean\" like Chazal did. They reclined on pillows on the floor or on couches, and this was an expression of freedom. The fact that we consider it a tircha is more an issue of our awkwardly perching at an angle on chairs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I’m not sure that there is all that much of a contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>As part of expressing our freedom on Seder night, we are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Required to lean (as was the way of free people);</p></li>\n<li><p>Not required to stand for Hallel, because requiring one to stand in the middle of his meal would not look like  the way free people behave.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does one calculate from pesach to the keriat yam suf?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/holidays/passover/shvii-shel-pesach/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Quote</a>“We are all familiar with the historical reason for celebrating the ‘seventh day of Passover’ – for (according to the Midrash) the miracle of the splitting of the Red Sea took place seven days after Bnei Yisrael left Egypt... Yet, to our surprise, that reason never appears in the Chumash.”</p>\n\n<p>What I would like to know is how one calculates from the erev Pesach till the keriat of Yam Suf, based upon storytelling or based upon the verses which we find in the Chumash.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I understood it like this: (Dates are listed night before day, so the night of Sunday would be The night before Sunday)\nThe Jews left Egypt the night of the fifteenth of Nissan. (Day one of Pesach): (Shemos 12:6,12) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָיָ֤ה לָכֶם֙ לְמִשְׁמֶ֔רֶת עַ֣ד אַרְבָּעָ֥ה עָשָׂ֛ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֣דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֑ה וְשָׁחֲט֣וּ אֹת֗וֹ כֹּ֛ל קְהַ֥ל עֲדַֽת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בֵּ֥ין הָעַרְבָּֽיִם...׃\n  וְעָבַרְתִּ֣י בְאֶֽרֶץ־מִצְרַיִם֮ בַּלַּ֣יְלָה הַזֶּה֒ וְהִכֵּיתִ֤י כָל־בְּכוֹר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם מֵאָדָ֖ם וְעַד־בְּהֵמָ֑ה וּבְכָל־אֱלֹהֵ֥י מִצְרַ֛יִם אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה שְׁפָטִ֖ים אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֽה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>You shall keep watch over it until the fourteenth day of this month; and all the assembled congregation of the Israelites shall slaughter it at twilight...\n  For that night I will go through the land of Egypt and strike down every first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and I will mete out punishments to all the gods of Egypt, I the LORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They slaughtered the Pesach on the fourteenth at twilight, and left that night.</p>\n\n<p>From then, we can assume the Jews were in the desert for three days before Pharaoh decided to chase them, since the original deal was that the Jews would leave for three days before returning, as we see (Shemos 10:23):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דֶּ֚רֶךְ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֔ים נֵלֵ֖ךְ בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר וְזָבַ֙חְנוּ֙ לַֽיהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֔ינוּ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר יֹאמַ֥ר אֵלֵֽינוּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>So we must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He may command us.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moshe never asks to leave for good, only to serve HaShem in the desert for three days. Likewise, Pharaoh never offered to let the Jews go for good (Shemos 12:31):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּקְרָא֩ לְמֹשֶׁ֨ה וּֽלְאַהֲרֹ֜ן לַ֗יְלָה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ ק֤וּמוּ צְּאוּ֙ מִתּ֣וֹךְ עַמִּ֔י גַּם־אַתֶּ֖ם גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וּלְכ֛וּ עִבְד֥וּ אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה כְּדַבֶּרְכֶֽם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>He summoned Moses and Aaron in the night and said, “Up, depart from among my people, you and the Israelites with you! Go, worship the LORD <strong>as you said!</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meaning that Pharaoh only let them go for three days, and after three days he would expect them back!</p>\n\n<p>Assuming the Jews, on foot, with kids and animals, were walking  half as fast the Egyptians, who started chasing them the night of the fourth day since they left (the eighteenth of nissan, and the night of the fourth day of pesach), the Egyptians would catch up to them by the night of the seventh day since they left Egypt (the night of the 21, the seventh night of pesach). </p>\n\n<p>The Egyptians then camped near the Jews for the night (shemos 14:20): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּבֹ֞א בֵּ֣ין ׀ מַחֲנֵ֣ה מִצְרַ֗יִם וּבֵין֙ מַחֲנֵ֣ה יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַיְהִ֤י הֶֽעָנָן֙ וְהַחֹ֔שֶׁךְ וַיָּ֖אֶר אֶת־הַלָּ֑יְלָה וְלֹא־קָרַ֥ב זֶ֛ה אֶל־זֶ֖ה כָּל־הַלָּֽיְלָה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>and it came between the army of the Egyptians and the army of Israel. Thus there was the cloud with the darkness, and it cast a spell upon the night, so that the one could not come near the other all through the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seemingly the next day, which was <em>The seventh day of pesach</em> The Jews crossed Yam Suf (Shemos 14:21):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּ֨ט מֹשֶׁ֣ה אֶת־יָדוֹ֮ עַל־הַיָּם֒ וַיּ֣וֹלֶךְ יְהוָ֣ה ׀ אֶת־הַ֠יָּם בְּר֨וּחַ קָדִ֤ים עַזָּה֙ כָּל־הַלַּ֔יְלָה וַיָּ֥שֶׂם אֶת־הַיָּ֖ם לֶחָרָבָ֑ה וַיִּבָּקְע֖וּ הַמָּֽיִם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Then Moses held out his arm over the sea and the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and turned the sea into dry ground. The waters were split,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Jews crossed the Yam Suf on the seventh day of Pesach</p>\n\n\n",

Is there a nuance in the Hebrew words for Life and Death in <a href=\"//sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.30.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 30:19</a> where we're told to choose life, or in the language used to describe the death of the righteous ones in Tanakh, that I am not getting?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Welcome to the site Tom, thank you for sharing your insightful question! </p>\n\n<p>\"Life\" and \"Death\" are more than just physical terms - they are spiritual realities. Essentially, the Almighty urges us to \"choose life\" which the commentators explain refers to following His Torah and mitzvos to attain eternal life.

So I am going to summarise the shiur and hopefully it is understandable.\nHe says that these 5 people all have in common a turning point in Klal, that excludes the spies and the egel since there is not one person who can represent them. Also Moshe is not given a parasha because Moshe symbolises so much and you can't isolate Moshe to one thing since he corresponds to so many millstones. Also Vayikra there is no name since the Rambam its a continuation of the Matan Torah experience so no major transition take place.\nSo we start with Noach there is a world before the mabul and a world after the mabul and the person who changes the course of time is Noach with the 7 Noachite Laws.\nNext is Yisro where we go from just keeping the 7 Noachite Laws into the 613 Mitzvos. He represents that transition from Exodus to Matan Torah.\nThe next is Korach where he represents a new transition in Judaism Machlokes, but not just any Machlokes rather the first Machlokes where the Jews actively and loudly challenge the authority and leadership of Moshe.\nNext is Balak where he got us right at the end of parashas Balak by getting away from our fabric of מה טובו being modest and destroys our fabric.\nFinally is Pinchas where he destroyed and restore the destruction caused by Balak, and being the real leader.\nAll of these 5 represent a transition in Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

But the best thing is to keep it minimal. In my humble opinion, and how i learned from my rabbis as i am also in the process, breaking very small rabbinic melacha would suffice. When a person keeps on doing something he gets used to it. If you keep on breaking big melachot, youll get use to it and have it difficult to stop doing it when you are fully obligated to guard the shabbat. But if its a small thing that you're breaking, you will be able to leave it easily. Mobile phones are very addictive stuffs, and youll have a really hard time getting over it once you fully convert.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm an agnostic non-Jew who will be visiting the Kotel. I want to use a kippah there if it is only to show respect for people.

I know that non-Jews have used kippot at the Kotel (for example, American presidents). But most of them (at least) were theists.

So it seems that there's not exactly guidance on the question, <em>\"How many should come true?\"</em> But rather the question ought to be, <strong>\"Did any fail?\"</strong></p>\n<p>It would seem, then, that a prophet's testing is technically continually on-going, as anything the prophet prophesies must be both loyal to HaShem and fit within the parameters of the rest of established Scripture and verified prophecies, and itself not fail to occur.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# On the halachic level, what are the requirements for a Gentiles couple to be considered married?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question may seem bizarre, since in our age marriage is a juridical institution widely regulated in every nation, with the presence of witnesses and a precise registration in public registers; however I am interested in the exquisitely halachic aspect.</p>\n\n<p>My doubts arise from the following passages of  Rambam’s Mishneh Torah:</p>\n\n<p>Hilchot Ishut 1:1 </p>\n\n<p><em>Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace and he and she decided to marry, he would bring her home, conduct relations in private and thus make her his wife. Once the Torah was given, the Jews were commanded that when a man desires to marry a woman, he must acquire her as a wife in the presence of witnesses. [Only] after this, does she become his wife. This is [alluded to in Deuteronomy 22:13]: \"When a man takes a wife and has relations with her....\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Hilchot Melachim 9:8</p>\n\n<p><em>When is a Gentile woman considered divorced? When her husband removes her from his home and sends her on her own or when she leaves his domain and goes her own way. They have no written divorce proceedings.</em></p>\n\n<p>From what Rambam says it would seem that, from a halachic point of view, the requirement for marriage between Gentiles is simple cohabitation, and that Halakhah considers the presence of a written legal act irrelevant to the Gentiles to ascertain the constitution and / or the dissolution of the marriage bond (I do not understand however, at this point, how were legally distinguished the wives and the pilagshim mentioned in the Pentateuch before  Matan Torah: perhaps the pilagshim were all slaves, as about some pilagshim it is explicitly said in the book of Genesis?)</p>\n\n<p>The issue has considerable relevance, as among the Noahide Laws there is a ban on sexual intercourse with a married woman (adultery), and therefore it is essential to know when a Gentile woman is to be considered married or not on the halachic level. According to what Rambam says, even the cohabitation between Gentiles so-called \"more uxorio\", that is, without the celebration of a marriage according to the state's binding laws, would still qualify as a marriage for the Halakhah, but perhaps I misunderstood.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For the purpose of Jewish Laws affecting the Noahide, Halacha is indifferent as to the ritual or ceremony by which non-Jews traditionally effect a marriage bond. </p>\n\n<p>[Nevertheless, practicing Noahides should definitely abide by the laws of the land that they live in, and follow any legal procedures that are required, in order to ALSO be considered married according to the laws of the land.]</p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of Jewish Law, crucial to the Noahide status of husband and wife, is the component of INTENT of marriage, which is initiated by the couple’s decision to live together as husband and wife, and followed by their sexual union. </p>\n\n<p>Maimonides describes three events that occur in a Noahide marriage. A. He and she decided to marry. B. He would bring her home. C. They would conduct relations in private. If these three conditions are met, then she is considered his wife, with all its ramifications.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides does not make any mention, in the context of Noahide marriage, of the need for a formal contract, or any witnesses, or a ceremony of any form, in order for the marriage to take effect.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't remember if a source for this was brought. Does anyone know any source on the matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Well, as it turns out, the person who gave over the dvar Torah wrote down all of it <a href=\"https://www.biu.ac.il/sites/default/files/inline-files/dvarim_givon.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. It seems that it should be inferred that Gilad was a place of slave-trafficking because the Yishmaelim <em>came from there</em> and they were obviously slavers, because both the brothers thought to sell Yosef to them upon seeing them and the Yishmaelim themselves immediately agreed to the sale when it was offered to them.</p>\n\n\n",

It is as if he disgraced,\n  blasphemed, and lifted up his hand against the Torah of Moses our\n  teacher. This applies even if their laws are the same as the laws of\n  the Jewish people. This is indicated by Exodus 21:1: \"These are the\n  judgments that you shall place before them.\" \"Before them\" and not\n  before gentiles; \"before them\" and not before ordinary people.</p>\n  \n  <p>The following procedure should be carried out if the gentiles have a\n  powerful law enforcement system and the opposing litigant is a\n  stubborn and powerful person from whom one cannot expropriate property\n  through the judicial system of the Jewish people. One should summon\n  him before the Jewish judges first. If he did not desire to come, one\n  may receive license from the court and salvage one's property from the\n  litigant by having the case tried in a gentile court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>it seems pretty clear that if even bringing a case to non-jewish court is problematic, for sure defending someone in it without legitimate cause. However, in the second paragraph of the above-quoted Rambam, as well as in the Shulchan Aruch Chosen Mishpat chapter 26 it says that there is at least one case where it's permitted to go to secular court:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היתה יד עכו\"ם תקיפה ובעל דינו אלם ואינו יכול להציל ממנו בדייני ישראל\n  יתבענו לדייני ישראל תחלה אם לא רצה לבא נוטל רשות מב\"ד ומציל בדיני\n  עכו\"ם מיד בעל דינו: הגה ויש רשות לב\"ד לילך לפני עכו\"ם ולהעיד שזה חייב\n  לזה (בה\"ת בשם ר' שרירא) וכל זה דוקא כשאינו רוצה להיות ציית דין אבל\n  בלא\"ה אסור לב\"ד להרשות לדון לפני עכו\"ם (מהרי\"ק שורש א'):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so perhaps in that one case alone it would be ok</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishneh Berurah (260:7) cites a custom that this applies even on Friday, notwithstanding the consideration of Kavod Shabbos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש מקומות שאין מגלחין ואין נוטלין צפורנים בר\"ח אפילו חל ביום עש\"ק כי\nכן צוה ר\"י חסיד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of the above, would the leniency of the MB to shave when Friday coincides with Rosh Chodesh Iyar apply even when Friday is also Rosh Chodesh?</p>\n<p>[Obviously, this question is only relevant for those who generally follow R' Yehuda HaChassid. For those who have the custom to disregard his rulings, the leniency obviously applies.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 6, §36) is lenient in the above case. He posits that the prohibition of R' Yehuda HaChassid to shave on a Friday Rosh Chodesh applies only when it was possible to shave for Shabbos on Thursday. However, in a situation where it was forbidden to shave up until Rosh Chodesh (like Sefiras Haomer), it would be permitted to shave on Rosh Chodesh too.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yaacov Kaminetzky (Emes L'yaakov, OC 260) agrees, and rules leniently.</p>\n\n<p>Other grounds to be lenient include the ruling of the Darkei Teshuvah (quoted in Shemiras Haguf veHanefesh, 68:9) that when there are two days of Rosh Chodesh, R' Yehuda HaChassid's prohibition to shave applies only on the second day. Accordingly, when Rosh Chodesh is on Friday and Shabbos, it would be permitted to shave on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>However, R' Eliyashiv and the Steipler (quoted <a href=\"http://beinenu.com/sites/default/files/alonim/197_26_80.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) ruled otherwise, forbidding shaving on Friday Rosh Chodesh Iyar. They understood that the MB was talking only to those who do not follow R' Yehuda HaChassid.</p>\n\n<p>Some poskim do not allow shaving on Friday Rosh Chodesh, but do permit shaving on Thursday after Chatzos, which is still Kavod Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh, but does not require transgressing R' Yehuda HaChassid's ruling. R Eliyashiv disagreed with this ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Sources: R' Yom Tov Zanger, <a href=\"http://beinenu.com/sites/default/files/alonim/197_26_80.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://beinenu.com/sites/default/files/alonim/197_26_80.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the \"Even Yisrael\" edition of Mishna berurah, I remember that they had a note from Dayan Fisher that the minhag (in Jerusalem at least) is not to be lenient like the Mishna berurah. I believe there is also discussion regarding R' Yehuda HaCHassid's concern as well.) If I can track down the sefer I'll try to copy the note here for you.</p>\n\n\n",

If these ethics exist unsourced or rationalized through Halacha, would it not be acceptable to say that Pirkei Avot establishes that morality can exist independently from Halacha? </p>\n\n<p>If this book is by definition a book of morality and ethical philosophy, isn't this saying those ideas can be independent from the law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Who says Pirkei Avos isn\"t halacha?</p>\n\n<p>1) Major parts are codified by the rambam, tur and Shulchan aruch (see rambam hilchos Talmud torah which quote numerous mishnayos from P.A. dealing with Talmud torah; and hilchos deos, especially perek 5 which quote many more sayings.\nTur starts off Orach Chaim by quoting the Mishna of \"R' Yehduda ben Teima omer havei ratz k'tzvi etc.\" </p>\n\n<p>2) lots of halacha isn't codified in Shulchan Aruch.

They are still halacha. The meforshim mention many of these ideas- magen Avraham and Mishna berurah on Shulchan Aruch O.C. 155 (I think- laws of going to work after learning in the morning)  and kitzur Shulchan aruch among others- and it's clear that these are halachic concepts. </p>\n\n<p>Most of Pirkei avos falls into these two categories- avodas halev (\"chovos halevovos\") and bein adam lachavero.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Talmud in Rosh Hashanah (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=4&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4a</a>) cites the following <em>beraita</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האומר סלע זו לצדקה בשביל שיחיו בני ובשביל שאזכה בה לחיי העולם הבא הרי זה צדיק גמור</p>\n  \n  <p>‘If a man says, I offer this sela’ for charity in order\n  that my children may live and in order that through it I may merit the future world, he may still be a wholly righteous man?’ </p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Rosh_HaShanah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosafot there raises a contradiction – in Avot 1:3 we are told not to worship for the sake of receiving reward:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והא דתנן פרק קמא דמסכת אבות אל תהיו כעבדים המשמשין את הרב על מנת לקבל פרס</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Penei Yehoshua</a> there notes that this is not necessarily a contradiction at all.

Thus, while one may be wholly righteous if he offers charity in order to receive reward, he has still failed to be pious:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נמצא דלפ\"ז לא קשיא דהכא בישראל נמי לא קאמר אלא דהוי צדיק גמור כשאומר בשביל שיחי' בני אבל חסיד לא הוי משא\"כ ההיא דאבות משנת חסידים היא כדאמרי' בעלמא מאן דבעי למיהוי חסידא לקיים מילי דאבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to assume that not only is the subject matter of Avot not \"strict law\", it is not even \"wholly righteous\"; it is yet further removed – a guide for the especially pious.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See the first words of the Bartenura on masechet Avot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אומר אני, לפי שמסכת זו אינה מיוסדת על פירוש מצוה ממצות התורה כשאר מסכתות שבמשנה, אלא כולה מוסרים ומדות, וחכמי אומות העולם ג\"כ חברו ספרים כמו שבדו מלבם בדרכי המוסר כיצד יתנהג האדם עם חבירו, לפיכך התחיל התנא במסכת זו משה קבל תורה מסיני, לומר לך שהמדות והמוסרים שבזו המסכתא לא בדו אותם חכמי המשנה מלבם \n   אלא אף אלו נאמרו בסיני</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since this tractate doesn't treat hallachic issues, but morality is the topic treated here, and sages of other people published many tractates about morality, based on their creativity, the author of the Mishna makes a point to say that the moralistic thinking he reports here aren't invented by the sages of the Mishna but are transmitted from Sinai. So, we understand that there is a need to transmit the right morality, and a man cannot reach it alone.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemara in Eruvin 100b says that we can learn righteousness from Animal Kingdom.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R`Johanan observed: If the Torah had not been given we could have learnt modesty from the cat, honesty from the ant, chastity from the dove, and good manners from the cock who first coaxes and then mates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, some basic rules are understandable by modeling, but a deep understanding needs learning from Tora, and the application of the rules needs a conjunction of this understanding with the halachot of the Torah, as the Rambam explains in Shmone Perakim, e.g. regarding the balance between two opposite principles, as to be good for someone else and to be good for oneself for example.</p>\n\n\n",

Because Avraham Avinu talked over with three people if he should publicize the Brit Milah? Why was Avraham Avinu worried? </p>\n\n<p>Avraham Avinu was אב המון גוים[shabbat 105a] and according to the seforno and the rav{from YU}, he felt his job was to show G-d to the world, and if he publicized it then people would think him as different and won't follow him, thus causing his mission to fail.

A 99-year-old man who just got something very painful done to him, thus he had to have been healed. Every angel can only do one task at a time [not going into the reason because that is deep kabala which I don't understand]. there were three angles and that explains why we were only told about the job of 2 of the angels. Thus we understand why 3 angels. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What rationale do the Rabbis use when differentiating amulets from recognized forms of idolatry?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The use of amulets for healing and protection has a long history in Judaism. I know that we are warned against idolatry when it comes to foreign worship practices around objects. (Prayer beads, Pagan stone practices, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>My question is what is the rationale used by the Rabbis in determining that amulets and other forms of Jewish practice <em>(Say the red string in Kabbalah practices)</em> are acceptable and different?</p>\n\n<p>Is it purely the intention being rooted in Hashem and Torah or is it something else entirely?</p>\n\n<p>What is the line that separates a common Jewish practice from something the Rabbis consider more dangerous?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A source to start with is <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=67&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 67a</a>-b, where R. Meir allows certain practices that have no natural basis, while the Chachamim forbid them as <em>darkei ha-Emori</em>, the ways of the pagan Amorites. The Gemara there lays down a basic rule, which is accepted as halachah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.301.27?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 301:27</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל דבר שהוא משום רפואה אין בו משום דרכי האמורי</p>\n<p>Any practice which is done for healing purposes is not prohibited on the grounds of <em>darkei ha-Emori</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Shulchan Aruch there adds that any kind of spell (לחש) is also permissible, whether for healing purposes or not, unless it's been tested and found not to work.)</p>\n<p>I haven't found any of the commentaries offering a rationale why all healing practices should be permissible. But it may be simply that, after all, the mechanism of action of \"naturalistic\" cures isn't always known either (more so back then, but there are still some cures today of which this is true), so that there's not such a sharp distinction between \"naturalistic\" and \"non-naturalistic\" ones.</p>\n<p>(Another angle on that last point, actually: even when the mechanism of action of a given cure is known, we still know that it is Hashem Who makes it effective. To just trust in the doctor and his medicine would in fact be a form of idolatry. The same, then, must be the case when using an amulet or whatnot - it's not the amulet itself that heals, it's that the user trusts that Hashem will make it do so.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am quoting an excerpt of \"Jewish Magic and Superstition\" by Joshua Trachtenberg (1939) found on pages 143-144 (titled \"Preparation of Amulets\"):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The popular addiction to this form of magic was so strong that it was futile to prohibit altogether the use of amulets on the Sabbath, and instead a set of rules was created which distinguished between effective and \"approved\" (literally, \"expert, experienced\") amulets, which might be worn on that day, and those technically classed as unapproved. According to these rules, an amulet prepared for a specific function, which had been successfully employed by three different persons, was \"approved\" as equally effective for all, and an expert who had written three different amulets which had been tested by three individuals was himself \"approved,\" and the products of his skill were permitted to all. Such amulets might be worn on the Sabbath, others not. These principles were established in the Talmud, and were frequently reiterated in the medieval literature. Medieval authorities were willing to forego a test in the case of recognized physicians: amulets written by a \"rechter doktor, der gewiss is’, un’ gedoktrirt is’\" were automatically \"approved\" as coming within these provisions. Their necessity was explained in this wise: were the effectiveness of the amulet, or the writer, to rest solely upon a test made in a single case, the cure might be attributable to the \"star\" of the patient or physician, rather than to the amulet itself. None the less, however insistently these rules were repeated by the rabbis, popular observance was lax. Even the authorities did not forbid the wearing of \"unapproved\" amulets on weekdays, though this was the subtle purpose of the legislation, and the rabbinic responsa indicate that they were freely worn on the Sabbath as well. The lust for miracles was more compelling than religious scruple, and rabbinic regulation of the amulet industry was as often honored in the breach as in the observance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As sources he lists Toss. Shab. V, 9, 10; Shab. 61a-b, 115b, and Rashi, 61a; J.

It appears that only an individual can say 'Aneinu' since he can anyway add additional supplications in <em>Shema Koleinu</em> as explained earlier in Siman 119, but the Prayer Leader (Shliach Tzibur) on behalf of a congregation of fasters does not say the Bracha 'Aneinu' unless we complete (the fast) and so is our custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Minimum <em>Shiur</em> (length) of a fast is from dawn till <em>Mincha Gedola</em> as the Mishna Brura 562,1 6 explains the Rema:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ו) אף על פי שאין משלימין - היינו אם פירש בשעת קבלה שלא להשלים אפילו התענה רק עד מנחה גדולה מתפלל עננו<br />\nhe needs to have accepted the mincha on the day before to fast till <em>Mincha Gedola</em> (30 minutes after Halachic midday) and then he can say \"Aneinu\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though if one says Aneinu in Shacharis he should avoid say <em>Tzom Taaniseinu</em> Mishna Brura 565,3 8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועיין בט\"ז שכתב דאם רוצה להתפלל בשחרית ענינו ולדלג תיבות ביום צום תעניתנו הרשות בידו דאז אין חשש שמא ימצא שקרן<br />\nThe taz says that one who says Aneinu in Shacharis should not say the words \"our fast day\" so that if he becomes unwell and eats he is not false stating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is clear from what the Torah writes: Moses took the staff that had been in the presence of the Lord, i.e. in the Tabernacle, the staff that had produced almonds in Numbers 17,23. Compare also Numbers 17,25, where Moses had been told to return his staff to the Tabernacle as an ongoing reminder to the obstinate community of Israel that a member of his family had been chosen to be High Priest. It was appropriate for this staff to be used again when dealing with a people that were in a rebellious mood. In this episode Moses committed his first error when he took the wrong staff, seeing that he thought he was supposed to strike the rock. The only reason that G-d had told Moses to take this staff, was that it had been used in conjunction with the rebelliousness of the Jewish people, as opposed to the obstinacy of Pharaoh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whereas the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.20.8?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Sforno_on_Numbers.20.8.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>G’d commanded that as soon as the rock would yield up its water, Moses was to use his staff in order to guide separate streams of that water to the various areas in which each tribe had its tents, so that they would not have to leave their homes, as they did to collect the manna, in order to benefit from this vital resource.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Targum \"Yonasan\"</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Numbers.20.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that Hashem told Moshe to take the staff as a backup option.

But it is to tell you, whenever Israel would look on high, and subjugate their hearts to their father in heaven, they would win...\" I might have thought that the hands of Moshe - holding <em>that</em> staff - could indeed help to win a battle!</p>\n\n<p>I haven't seen a description of what Moshe did with the staff [pictures of the battle never seem to show it, and indeed people never remember it, being mentioned a couple of verses too early]. But I didn't see either that he did anything with the staff at Makas Bechoros, slaying of the first-born ('לא ע\"י מלאך כו) - and yet our sages say that all ten plagues were inscribed in the staff: דצ\"ך עד\"ש באח\"ב. \nIt was created Erev Shabbos along with all the miraculous objects (Pirkei Avos 5(6)), and I guess the staff represents all the occasions where Hashem overruled the laws of nature to help his people.</p>\n\n\n",

Certainly any Beit Din lacking the power of prophecy would agree with Joseph that 10 sons of a foreign prince like Jacob, coming in by separate entrances (according to Breshit Rabbah) are suspicious enough to justify detention. Shimon and Levi were known to have destroyed Shechem by themselves, which would be ample reason to separate them (as Tanchuma says).</p>\n\n<p>If we assume the Beit Din knew that they were Joseph's brothers, it still makes no difference. According to all evidence known at the time, Joseph's brothers hated him and wanted to kill him. Joseph was the Prime Minister who saved Egypt and the whole world from famine, and any threat to him was a matter of national security for Egypt. Joseph could not expel them (it might lead to Jacob's death) and could not detain them (they were a threat). So he detained the most dangerous one and sent the rest home with food.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Turn the question around: Why were the brothers allowed to steal Yosef, and even sell him as a slave? That's a full-fledged violation of the prohibition לא תגנוב in the Ten Commandments - which carries a death penalty. It is described exactly that way in the piyut we say about the Asarah Harugei Malchus, in the argument presented by the evil ruler.<br>\nThe answer (of course) is that they were not allowed to do it. The entire rest of the story is how that gets fixed. Yosef was the victim, he was completely allowed to punish them, measure for measure. As his brother says to him, G-d has found out the sin of your servants - we will all be slaves to [you] our master.<br>\nYosef is not doing more to them than they deserve, he is doing less. The brothers know that and acknowledge it as part of G-d's judgment, even if they don't (yet) understand why (\"They trembled, one to another, saying, 'What is G-d doing with us?!'\"). During the story, Yosef's love for them overcomes his strict judgment (\"Yosef could not longer hold himself back\"), and so does G-d's. His love for them overcomes his pain at what they did to him, bit by bit as the story progresses, and as he sees them growing in regret for what they had done (\"they did not know that he could understand them... he turned away from them and cried...\") Yosef arranges the story so that they rerun the same events and the same tests with Binyamin, this time successfully, and helps them to rebuild their relationship with him.<br>\nMaybe the best story in Tanach.</p>\n\n\n",

It's a lot shorter to say \"tamei\" than \"may not enter the Beis Hamikdash or eat kodshim,\" and the same for \"tahor.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>At least when it comes to taharah, saying \"he may enter the BHMK or eat kodshim\" could be highly misleading, because it would imply that there are no other factors to consider.

(Even worse if the first food was chullin: you are in fact allowed to eat it, but it can still contaminate food of terumah or kodshim that it touches, and then they have to be burned.) Whereas now that it says יטמא, the Gemara expounds this to mean not only יִטְמָא (intransitive, it becomes tamei), but יְטַמֵּא (transitive, causes others to become tamei).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The first thing to realize is that tumah and tahara are spiritual realities. Tuma'ah is related to the word for \"blocked.\" </p>\n\n<p>We just read in parshas shmini (Vayikra 11:33) ולא תטמאו בהם ונטמתם בם \"don't defile yourself with them (shekatzim, non-kosher insects and bugs) and become defiled with them\". </p>\n\n<p>Chazal explains that in the last phrase 'and become defiled with them' the word is spelled missing the letter א to imply that eating these bugs results in טימטום הלב a spiritual \"blockage\" of the heart.\nThis is the gemar<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.39a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a Yuma 39a:\nתנא</a> דבי רבי ישמעאל עבירה מטמטמת לבו של אדם שנאמר (ויקרא יא, מג) ולא תטמאו \nבהם ונטמתם בם אל תקרי ונטמאתם אלא ונטמטם </p>\n\n<p>In the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught: Sin stupefies the heart of a person who commits it, as it is stated: “And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified” (Leviticus 11:43) Do not read that term as: “And be impurified [venitmetem]”; rather, read it as: And your hearts will be stupefied [venitamtem]</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains:\nמטמטמת\nאוטמת וסותמת מכל חכמה:\nThe word metamtemet means \"blocked up from all wisdom.\"\nIt makes a person less receptive to spirituality (ruchniyos) and less in tune with spiritual needs.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, Tahara is associated with both purity and clarity (see gemara brachos 2b where a clear sky or completely dark skies are referred to as טוהר.)</p>\n\n<p>It results in the ability to tune into spirituality.</p>\n\n<p>You're right, there is no objective problem with being tameh in general. But, even though it's permissible, there's an advantage to being tahor when possible as it makes a person more receptive to spirituality.\nThis is part of the idea behind Takanas Ezra, Ezra HaSofer's enactment that a person who has had a seminal emission may not learn torah or daven/pray. \n(See the third perek of Brachos for more details; it's a larger topic for a separate post.)</p>\n\n<p>Besides the reality of the tuma'ah, the torah then told us that certain types of tuma'ah have certain consequences. People who have certain levels can't touch different levels of kadosh things (terumah, maser, korbonos, the beis hamikdosh, etc.) \nThe Tuma'ah which results from menstruation creates a prohibition on marital relations (I'm avoiding the famous chakira about thia).</p>\n\n<p>But all of those consequence follow as a result of there being a spiritual reality first.</p>\n\n<p>The tiferes Yisrael, in the beginning to his commentary on mishnayos taharos, has a decently sized kuntrus (I think called Yevakesh Daas?) which explains all the categories of tumah, including the various halachos each one has (how it's transmitted, how is it removed, as well as the consequences of having such states of tumah).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's a great question. Tumah (\"blocked\") by <em>definition</em> means inability to become kadosh, holy. Tahor is the opposite, able to become kadosh. Something that is tahor may not be kadosh, but it needs to be <em>potentially</em> kadosh. Thus, whenever you call something tamei, you need to be ready to describe which kedushah it blocks.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different types of tumah in the Torah, mostly starting from Parshas Shemini and running well into Parshas Emor; tumah is the major topic of this section of Vayikra. The first mentioned there is not usually thought of as \"tamei\" at all: which animals are we allowed to eat (\"temei hu lachem\") . The end of that parsha says, because you my nation are kadosh, and these types of food interfere with that kedushah (\"metamtem es haleiv\"). Shemini veers into what we usually call tum'as maga - from touching - and that continues for Tazria and Metzora. Even within that, though, there are various levels: metzora is forbidden in the whole camp/city. Zav from the machaneh levi. Most tum'as maga, just from the Mishkan and eating kodoshim. Each of those represents a type of kedushah that is being blocked.</p>\n\n<p>A man and his wife have <em>kiddushin</em>, she is \"set aside\" to him, so there is a type of tumah of a man to his wife - nidah, znus, sotah, machazir gerushaso. That yields a very interesting phrase in Tazria: d'mei taharah (\"blood of purity\"). The woman after childbirth is 100% <em>tamei</em> for going into the Mikdash, but she is tehorah to her husband.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, to actually address your question: in Vayikra, Toras Cohanim, there is a large section talking about how to be <em>ready</em> to receive kedushah. After that section there is a lot more further on, on what constitutes kedushah and how to actually receive it (Parshas Kedoshim tih'yu...)\nShameless plug, but there is a chapter on this in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1utktKmLJyz3PizHYllmzraCrZ3SmBE4J\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1utktKmLJyz3PizHYllmzraCrZ3SmBE4J</a> [sorry! but there really is a chapter on it on this week's parsha (Tazria-Metzora).:)]</p>\n\n\n",

After going through the wash system three samples are checked. If the samples are found to be free of infestation, a chazakah on the system has been achieved. It can now be assumed that the system can effectively clean the vegetables and no more checking is required!</p>\n\n<p>Of course, periodic inspections have to be done to be sure that the system is still cleaning properly so that the chazakah can be maintained. Different conditions, seasons, or different sources of supply can affect the status quo as well, so, again, the system must be monitored constantly. At times, due to atmospheric conditions, high humidity, heavy rain, or seasonal change, there is an increase of insect presence in the fields. Of course this means that there will be more toloyim in the leafy vegetables. This manifests itself with a higher insect presence in the vegetables when the company tests the quality of the unprocessed lettuce before it is brought into the facility for further washing and processing. During these times, the wash system may not effectively clean for toloyim, and the certification is removed until the field conditions normalize so that the wash system will do an effective job. Often this occurs around Pesach when the consumer will not see the Star-K symbol on the date code for a prolonged period until conditions normalize.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally a consumer will call the Star-K and report that an insect was found in their vegetable salad. Not pleasant. However, this would not break the chazaka, nor should the bag of salad be discarded. If this happens, a good insurance practice would be to check the remaining salad. The next bag does not require additional checking.</p>\n\n<p>I would only suggest to CYLOR! </p>\n\n\n",

Since the Manna began to fall during this month (on the 15th day of Iyar 2448) - and it was a perfect food from which resulted no sickness, pain or even waste matter and even cured those who were ill - Hashem left the curative nature of the month in effect even through today. Accordingly, Iyar is a time of healing.</p>\n\n<p>Reb Pinchas of Koritz says that the rain that falls between Pesach and Shavuot is a refuah for diseases that have no cure.

I was told about this great Sefer called <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B000GPA8BU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kerem Yehoshua</a> and I'd like to get my hands on it. However, due to the current world pandemic it's pretty hard for me to purchase it.</p>\n<p>So, can someone please give me a synopsis of what he says one should do in order to retain his learning (chazaring shas)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I found this book yesterday in my yeshiva's library. It seems like an interesting book. In any case, the book describes his technique at length, but there's one specific chapter called \"סדר הלימוד בקיצור\" - \"The progression of study in short\". I'll bring what he says there in my own words:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Learn a quarter or a third of the page (from the beginning to the end of one issue), or when studying mishna, learn the entire mishna (or part of it, if it's long) and try to understand the reasons of the rulings and the disagreements, and in each disagreement, try to understand if the disagreement is about the logic (סברא) or just out of understanding the wording of the mishna, or if it isn't a disagreement but מר אמר חדא ומר אמר חדא ולא פליגי (one said such and such and the other said something else and they don't disagree), and <strong>do not look into Rishonim and Achronim during the first three times of studying</strong>, because this confuses the learner and occupies the mind. You may only look if you really don't understand anything, but then only in Rishonim (and preferable to stick only to Rashi).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After learning the prescribed length of gemara or mishna, once having understood more or less the gemara, recite everything by heart <strong>in your own words</strong>, to make sure you properly understood the issue, and haven't simply memorized something you don't understand. Make sure you are able to properly explain the entire length of the discussion/debate and what dinim are to be learned from this section. If you're unsure whether you can already recite by heart, look again to see that nothing has been missed and recite again. After knowing that section properly, continue to the next section.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And so, finish the sugiya or daf. And then re-learn once the entire sugiya. Re-learning=doing exactly as you did when you first learned it, no skipping or fast-forwarding. Pace yourself, make sure you've properly gone over everything that was said and that you've understood everything once again.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now feeling comfortable with what you've learned, learn the sugiya over again. And once again, break down the sugiya to sections and learn each section is described above.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And once you feel that you understand and remember the sugiya, learn it all over again a third time, exactly like the previous two times.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At the end of the sugiya, learn Rashi slowly, making sure Rashi is properly understood. learn the entire sugiya with Rashi.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Having learned all of Rashi on the sugiya, learn Tosfot, and with the Tosfot re-learn the sugiya. This can be done in one of two ways: Either learn Tosfot by itself, or learn the sugiya and stop whenever arriving at a Tosfot to learn the Tosfot. And with Tosfot, you should learn it as done with the gemara and Rashi, slowly and maing sure you've understood everything.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Having finished Tosfot, learn it once more, and do so exactly the same way as the first time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you can, make up a time every night to go over everything you've learned during the day. On Friday and Shabbat, go over everything learned during the week at least once (twice is preferable). During these study periods, try learning the gemara based on understanding the final dinim, not specifically the back and forth of the debates. For example, for every section of a mishna, attempt to organize all of the views on a certain halacha - the gemara, Rashi, the Tosfot. Then on to the next halacha. And if you can, learn Rosh, Rif, Ran or Nimukei Yosef on what you've studied.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>All of this of course takes time, until you've gotten used to this way of study.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After a month or six weeks, you should take a break from learning new gemaras by re-learning in a few days everything learned over the previous weeks. During vacations (bein hazmanim), re-learn everything studied during the previous z'man.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>During the next z'man, dedicate an hour a day to re-learn everything from the previous z'man.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If one doesn't have time to learn Tosfot, or if it's hard for him, then learn only gemara and Rashi in the prescribed manner, which has tremendous value in itself.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's worth finding a copy to read the more in-depth explanations. He also gives pointers for use during the actual study, and such.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there a story, similar to the story of matzah?</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: This is not a duplicate. This question is asking about passover specifically.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I've been around practicing Jews, including gefilte fish eaters, all my life, and have never heard of such a tradition. Many Jews eat gefilte fish weekly or even more often; many never eat it at all. I've never heard of a practice of eating it specifically on Passover. Indeed, many Jews won't eat any fish — gefilte or other — on Passover.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of three possible answers to your question, then.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You're wrong. There's no such tradition. You may have been influenced in your thinking by the fact the supermarkets carry a greater variety and quantity of Jewish-style foods on and before Passover, including gefilte fish, and therefore you're associating it with Passover.</li>\n<li>The tradition is a new one, caused by the supply-side consideration in the previous bullet point and/or by people's generally feeling more traditional (wanting to return to their gustatory roots) at Passover.</li>\n<li>The reason people don't eat fish on Passover is that, in Europe, fish were kept alive by putting whiskey-soaked bread in their mouths (see e.g. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/14556\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Taame Haminhagim</em></a>, footnote 7 to paragraph 478, who discusses this issue though he doesn't mention not eating fish at all). This can sometimes render the fish non-kosher for Passover (as bread and whiskey are). There is more room for leniency under some circumstances (as also described there) if the fish was bought before Passover began. If you're right that there's a tradition of eating gefilte fish on Passover, then I conjecture that it may stem from having older fish on Passover, bought before the week-long holiday began, which would last longer fresh if turned into gefilte fish than if eaten whole (or people may have thought so, or at least the added ingredients would mask the bad flavor of fish that's going bad). Just a conjecture.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This answer adds more to msh210♦ third answer</p>\n\n<p>The real answer is In Europe The ashkanazim did not live off the coast like the Sephardim. Fish was lechoved Shabbat and Yom tif. They did not have refrigerators back then so how did they store their fish? They made it into gefilte fish. If you look at Sephardim they don't really eat gefilte fish, really only Ashkenazim do and for this purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "North and South - which is it?",
    "content": "# North and South - which is it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>1) The Torah says that North, צפון, is the place for bringing kodshei kodoshim, especially-holy korbonos - like olos. For a list, see perek Eizehu Mekoman in Zevachim.<br>\n2) Chazal also say (Bava Basra 25b), הרוצה להחכים ידרים, הרוצה להעשיר יצפין - One who wishes to become wise, let him turn slightly to the south when he prays [the Menorah in the Mishkan was in the south]. One who wishes to become wealthy should turn slightly to the north [the Shulchan in the Mishkan was in the north.] So here south represents the spiritual, north the physical.<br>\n3) Zevachim 116a, it brings the verse (Shir Hashirim 4:16) עורי צפון ובואי תימן (Maharsha - awake, North; arrive, South). The gemara learns from there that Bnei Noach are not allowed to bring shelamim, and therefore Israel was only allowed to do so after the Torah was given. (Maharsha - awaken, old olos that people could bring before. Come anew, shelamim, that can be brought now. Or see Rashi.) Israel's greatness meant being allowed \"in the south\", and being allowed to actually eat korbonos. [Note that some korbonos that are eaten (chatas, asham) are still kodesh kodoshim and brought in the north as well.]  </p>\n\n<p>And now I'm confused. Which represents the spiritual, the north or the south?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Suggestion (Some of the comments leaned in this direction as well):\nRav Hirsch at the beginning of Vayikra talks about צפון, the north. If I understand him correctly, he says that it does represent the physical - and therefore some korbonos represent the person <em>sacrificing</em>, subjugating, his physical side.<br>\nBut there is a higher level. The Ramchal in Mesilas Yesharim explains the idea of Kedushah  (holiness) at the end of his sefer. Prishus (separating from the physical) is an earlier stage. Once a person has achieved prishus and grown in his control over his physical desires, <em>then</em> he can be ready to reach kedushah. Instead of just suppression and control, the person can reach the stage of <em>using</em> the physical in service to the spiritual. Instead of the two being in conflict, they become two parts of a whole, and the person's use of the physical becomes part of his overall avodah. - according to the Ramchal.<br>\nIt could be that the \"North\" is the only kind of korbon appropriate to a Ben Noach: controlling the physical. But the gemara in Zevachim doesn't say that Bnei Noach are North and Yisrael is the South instead. It says that Yisrael is on the South <em>in addition</em> (Rashi). The new level is to be able to handle both. Chazal say that this explains the name \"shlamim\": a korbon that makes \"shalom\", represents completeness: Hashem, cohen, yisroel.<br>\n[Advertisement] In my sefer, in Parshas Terumah, I list a number of parallels between the Aron Hakodesh and the Shulchan - and a different set of parallels between the Keruvim and the Menorah. These are different levels. In the outer Heichal, the Menorah and the Shulchan represent two independent forces. You can't turn both ways!<br>\nBut in the Holy of Holies, the two vessels are combined into a single vessel where both forces are one, as their source is One.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can I convert a pool into a kosher mikvah (for wife)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>With Covid and the health concerns about going to a mikvah.  I was wondering if it's feasible to convert our pool into a fully kosher mikvah (for the wife to use).  Given that tzniyus concerns are taken care of the Q is purely in regards to the mikvah.\nThe pool is an inground pool with a side hot tub which is connected by a wall and hole between it and the main pool.<br>\nIf that hole were adequately plugged, and the hot tub filled with only rain water, and disconnected from the filtered water flow.<br>\nWhat would be needed?<br>\nOf course I'm going to ask my LOR, but I wanted to find out the feasilbility beforehand, and find out the Q's so that I can have all my facts/measurements on hand.</p>\n\n<p>thanks</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Obviously, as you mentioned, you'll ask a specific shaila.\nHere's a couple of issues for you to check out and ask:</p>\n\n<p>1) how was your pool made? If it was a preformed concrete block which is placed in the ground, it might have \"toras kli\" on it (halachically called a vessel) which would make it pasul. You might need to undo the status of a kli by detaching it from the ground, puncturing a hole in the bottom so it wouldn't be able to hold water, and then reattach it. This would be a real pain to do with a hot tub!</p>\n\n<p>However, most (though not all) in-ground pools and tubs are made from just pouring cement into the hole and attaching tiles. In this case, it's unlikely that anything had \"toras kli\" before attaching it to the ground. \n(Shut Shevet Halevi and Minchas Yitzchak are both lenient regarding tiles, even if they have an indentation in the back to receive the cement, since they are meant to be attached to the ground.)</p>\n\n<p>2) Is there a drain of any sort? You only mentioned a hole between the tub and the pool. Is there a drain in the tub itself? depending on how it is constructed and where it's located, that could also be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>3) How would you plug up the hole? You don't want a plug which can be mekabel tum'ah. Plastic or rubber is usually ok, metal ones aren't. Some plugs also have indentations which could be problematic (a 'beis kibul' or a receptacle is called a kli) so you would need to check out how the hole is being plugged up. </p>\n\n<p>4) How much water does the tub hold? The minhag is to have 1000liters (shu't cheshev HaEfod and many sefarim quoting him) though the actual shiur is between 750-850 liters. You need to check with your rav about it. \nThere needs to be enough space above this level of water that even when a person goes in, and the water rises, it won't spill out of the mikva.</p>\n\n<p>(There's a preference that there should be a shiur of water below the hole connecting the pool and tub, such that even if the hole gets left open accidentally, there's more room to rely on the shiur beneath the whole see siman 201 sif 40-41.)</p>\n\n<p>5) How is the water entering the tub? we generally want the water to enter after running on the ground at least 3 tefachim to accomplish \"hamshacha\" which removes lots of issues with the water. You want to make sure the area surrounding the tub is free of anything which could make the water pasul (i.e. it shouldn't hit any tools, or anything which has toras kli on it.)</p>\n\n<p>6) You need to make sure the pool is entirely dry before any rain water goes in. That means after draining the water, you would go over it with towels and maybe putting heaters there to ensure it's dry. There's often a problem when concrete gets dried, but then afterwards \"sweats\" the water from inside it. So you need to check with your LOR how dry you have to make it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I spoke with my LOR who was nice enough to entertain the idea.  His response was:</p>\n\n<p><strong>In theory</strong> </p>\n\n<p>it's possible using the inground neighboring hot tub as the בור (pit) to store the 40 seah of good water, and allow השקה (through the hold of adequate size) for the waters to touch.  There would be work involved to insure the details.  For example:  that things were totally dry to start and no leaks and that it's close enough to the roof of the house to get enough quantity of runoff rainwater and that as the rain waters are diverted into the בור that they don't get disqualified along the way.  i.e. doable, but not simple.</p>\n\n<p>He also pointed out that a while back - when Jews came to America and the idea of mikvah was frowned upon (dirty) and many people stopped going - that someone published a book detailing how people can make their own mikvah (to their own standards of cleanliness).</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Given that all of the requirements were met, and with his backing, he would be able to find someone qualified to inspect and give the initial OK that it's kosher to use for a niddah.\n<em>However</em>, in order to maintain the \"hechsher\" the Rav hamakshir would have to keep on top of it so that he's satisfied to maintain the hechser for subsequent tevilahs.

[Bava Metzia 58b] [See also Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 228:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But commentators are telling us that all the time.  Some even tell us that the ONLY reason bad things happen to us is because we sinned.  The destruction of the first Temple?  Because of idolatry, sexual immorality and murder.  The destruction of the second Temple?  Because of senseless hatred.  [Yoma 9b]  Maalot, Israel, 1974, when Palestinian terrorists machine-gunned 25 children to death?  Because 25 mezuzot on the school doors did not have kosher scrolls in them.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we reconcile the two teachings?  Perhaps the first refers to the victims <em>while</em> they are suffering, and the second refers to long after the events.  But still, why should there be a difference?  If the purpose of telling a victim it's his fault is to get him to look to the future and improve his behavior, when <em>is</em> the best time to do that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As with so many words of Chazal, a judgment call is involved here. First (as you mentioned) there is the issue of timing. When the person is in mourning, that is a time for nechama, comfort. Mussar is for a different time.<br>\nSecond is the issue of knowledge. Our sages may be able to pin down with certainty the root cause of a disaster, the \"ג' חמורות\" or שנאת חנם. The rest of us are not generally so gifted. You see with Job's friends, who were so terribly wrong in their understanding of what was happening to him; in the end Hashem had to set them straight, and criticize them for presuming to judge him. The other example you gave is just as bad: We all have so many issues, so many things that we need to improve; how can anyone in our days dare to suggest that mezuzos are the cause of someone's suffering?<br>\nEven when not accusing of sins: I have personally been to shivos where one of the \"comforters\" began to quote sayings of Chazal - comforting sayings! - as if they were able to understand what was happening in heaven, and it actually upset the mourners more. We are not gifted with that level of understanding and it isn't helpful to the mourners to pretend that we are.<br>\nThat being said, I heard a tape by Rav Avigdor Miller z\"l where he did just the opposite. He was speaking, as he often did, of ונשמרתם מאד בנפשותיכם, being very careful with safety. He told of a man who left a large pot of hot water at the edge of a table, when children were around. Then he said, When I visited the man at his little boy's shiva... You could hear the moan from the audience on the tape. Oy. He said, the man asked me, What sin could I have done to deserve this? Rav Miller told him, Your sin was leaving a pot of hot water where children could reach it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question did not establish any contradiction, if you look carefully at your examples of commenters telling us things.</p>\n<p>The brayta on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.58b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 58b</a> discusses causing pain to people with your words, by reminding a descendant of converts of his ancestry, a convert of his previously eating non-kosher food, of someone currently undergoing suffering that it is all his fault, or making a prank by directing donkey drivers (pizza delivery folk) to someone who doesn't sell grain.</p>\n<p>It is <strong>possible</strong> that the author of the brayta maintains that afflictions of love (yesurin shel ahava) are possible, such that (as we see in Berachot 5a) after searching one's own actions and finding no fault, he might conclude that these are afflictions of love. It is <strong>possible</strong> that the author of the brayta possesses <em>seichel</em> that others don't, and know that there is a time and place for telling someone this. As we see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot, 4:18</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן אֶלְעָזָר אוֹמֵר, אַל תְּרַצֶּה אֶת חֲבֵרְךָ בִשְׁעַת כַּעֲסוֹ, וְאַל תְּנַחֲמֶנּוּ בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁמֵּתוֹ מֻטָּל לְפָנָיו, וְאַל תִּשְׁאַל לוֹ בִשְׁעַת נִדְרוֹ, וְאַל תִּשְׁתַּדֵּל לִרְאוֹתוֹ בִשְׁעַת קַלְקָלָתוֹ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Do not try to appease your friend during his hour of anger; Nor comfort him at the hour while his dead still lies before him; Nor question him at the hour of his vow; Nor strive to see him in the hour of his disgrace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is <strong>possible</strong> that the author of the brayta distinguishes between people considering their own deeds (as Berachot 5a states, <em>yesfashfesh bemaasav</em>) and people considering the deeds of others, judging them and blaming them (which would be <em>yefashfesh bemaaseihem</em>).</p>\n<p>Now, let us consider your three examples and see if any of involved going up to the people actually suffering and telling them that it was their fault.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The destruction of the first Temple? Because of idolatry, sexual immorality and murder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How many years after the destruction of the First Temple was this explanation offered? Rabbi Yochanan ben Torta, the author of this statement, was a contemporary of Rabbi Akiva, lived in the time of Bar Kochba and was one of his opponents. So much after the destruction of Shiloh and the destruction of the First Temple.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The destruction of the second Temple? Because of senseless hatred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about in terms of the destruction of the second temple, which Rabbi Yochanan ben Torta also mentioned? In terms of generations of Tannaim, the first generation was Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai et al., the second generation which was between the destruction and the revolt was Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer, who were teachers of Rabbi Akiva, and the third generation, around the time of the revolt, were Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Tarfon, and so on. So Rabbi Yochanan ben Torta was not speaking to people who were in the process of being destroyed, telling them that it was all their fault. The prooftexts in the gemara are from Neviim such as Yeshaya, warning people well before the destruction of what would ensue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maalot, Israel, 1974, when Palestinian terrorists machine-gunned 25 children to death? Because 25 mezuzot on the school doors did not have kosher scrolls in them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please give an exact citation of this \"comment\", which shows a non-idiot commenting that this was <strong>punishment</strong> for this sin. It is indeed a matter of halachic debate whether a school, which is not a residence, even requires a mezuza. So they put some up, didn't realize that some were pasul, and the penalty was death? The school administrators sinned and the children were punished?</p>\n<p>From what I was able to find from some Internet searches, it was 22 or 21 children, corresponding to what someone claimed (without publishing pictures to prove it) were 21 invalid mezuzot of all the mezuzot in the school. And the student branch of the Lubavitch movement issued a flyer which said that the homes (rather than the school) of most of the hostages had invalid mezuzot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A kosher mezuzah on your door posts not only makes your house an abode for G-dliness, but is also your security measure even after you have left home for the day. And since all Jews are one large body, it increases the security of the entire Jewish nation. Due to the fact that most of the mezuzot in the homes of hostages, upon examination, were found to be defective, improperly placed or not on every door post, all Jews should check their mezuzot immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That wasn't directed towards the administration of the school. It wasn't directed at the parents of the murdered children. It was directed at klal Yisrael, to learn from the incident.</p>\n<p>It also didn't say that it was punishment for the sin of having improper mezuzot.

    "content": "# Animal Suffering and The Cruelty of Nature\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Whilst the world's ecosystem and natural phenomena are magnificently complex and awe-inspiring, it is undoubtedly a system that is brutal - 'red in tooth and claw'. The laws of nature we can observe involve spectacular intricacies but also immense animal suffering. Why would an omnipotent God create a vicious foodchain and unforgiving evolutionary process when a \"kinder\" perfectly-functioning model could have been implemented?  </p>\n\n<p>Based on Isaiah 11:6; \"[In the Messianic age] The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together\", implies that the current ecosystem of our planet is not ideal or utopian. The prophet therefore seems to acknowledge there is an evil in nature.  </p>\n\n<p>The classical theodicies attempting to explain human suffering, and many answers suggested as a solution to the problem of evil do not seem to apply to the suffering endured by animals who have no free will. Are there any sources that address natural evil that is not caused by man, and to a very large degree do no directly impact mankind? What approaches can be taken to this question?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R. Natan Slifkin wrote a whole chapter on this topic in his work \"Man and Beast.\" (This was published in 2006, after the controversy over his other works; it has the haskama of Rav Berel Wein. It addressed the relationship between animals and people in Judaism, not touching on the controversial topics of his other works.) </p>\n\n<p>In \"When bad things happen to good animals\" (chapter 5) he considers various possibilities discussed in Jewish sources, none of them really satisfying. \nThese include: Hashem compensating the in Olam Haba, the animals are gilgulim, or the current \"laws of nature\" (including the imperfect animal suffering) are a result of the sin of Adam Harishon, which made the entire world imperfect, and thus will remain this way until Moshiach comes (as the OP mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>Each of these reasons have problems, as he enumerates in the chapter.</p>\n\n<p>His basic conclusion is that of the Kuzari- When we see that Hashem clearly set up the world in this way, then we put this in the category of things Hashem does that we don't understand. \nIt's not an accident, but we don't have the necessary wisdom to comprehend the need for it.</p>\n\n<p>It's a fascinating read, though obviously in any work like this there is room to disagree. But it's a thought-provoking discussion. He provides a couple of practical lessons we can learn out from animal suffering as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I ask whether animals are proper subjects for this kind of moral question. Human beings know what we're thinking or feeling. Neurologically, it's done in an area in the prefrontal cortex other animals don't have. So, we have no scientific reason to believe animals know what they are thinking or feeling.</p>\n\n<p>The Behaviorists tried saying that mental states were entirely defined as a set of predispositions about how we respond to upcoming stimuli. No first person account. No \"qualia\", what it's like to experience something. The school of psychology died because of that last one. It is hard to convince people they don't have first-hand experiences when everyone has them all the time.</p>\n\n<p>You may have been up late one night in the dorm wondering whether the mental experience you have when seeing red is the same as my red. Maybe your experience of red is mine for blue, and my blue -- your red. We'd both use the words \"red\" and \"blue\" for the same stimuli, so there is no way either of us could know.</p>\n\n<p>The behaviorists would have considered the question unscientific at best because it's first person, not objective, provable to others and reproducible in experiments. And the purists would even say the question is entirely meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>But what if it's true for animals? What if they have no \"I\" inside to experience suffering? That \"pain\" is just a stimulus that causes avoidance responses, and there is no one there to watch the state of the internal variables to actually suffer?</p>\n\n<p>The lack of having the parts of the brain we use to do that implies we have little reason to assume otherwise. Yes, animal behavior seems complex, and we end up speaking of our pets the way we speak of people. But the truth is, we speak of the behavior of complicated programs in the same terms too. \"The Roomba wants to clean the corner.\" \"The chess program wants me to move my queen.\" Triggering our instinct to anthropomorphize isn't proof that they actually are thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Now, since this is Mi Yodeya, let me make a religious argument for that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>A fundamental element of free will is being able to think about our thoughts and feelings. You can't willingly choose unless you can watch the process of choice and make decisions about decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Animals don't have free will. They're automata. Adam is given free will in Bereishis 2:7, \"and He breathed into him a nishmas chayah -- a living soul.\" (See Meshekh Chokhmah ad loc.) Having the ability to decide what you become is the \"image of the Divine\" that Hashem gave Adam. Which means that other living beings can't make decisions about their decisions. There is no thought about thought, experience of emotions.</p>\n\n<p>And with this, we can understand the halakhah of tza'ar ba'alei chaim -- [unnecessary] cruelty to animals. It is a Torah (as opposed to rabbinic) prohibition to cause needless pain to animals. But with the slightest justification -- other than a cruel person's enjoyment of the pain itself -- causing the pain is permitted. We don't require some threashold of utility to outweigh the price on the animal.</p>\n\n<p>I am arguing that's because the animal's pain is not similar in kind to human suffering.</p>\n\n<p>There is a comparatively famous ruling by the Noda biYhudah on the subject of hunting. He opens by finding hunting technically permitted by halakhah. But the majority and theme of the responsum is that it's morally wrong, associated in Jewish tradition with villains like Nimrod and Eisav.</p>\n\n<p>We are more concerned with the mental state of the person inflicting the pain than the animal. The stereotype story of a psychopath often has him pulling the wings off flies or throwing rocks at birds as steps along the downward spiral. After all, they have to fight the firsthand experience which sure seems like they're causing suffering, and so callousness develops.</p>\n\n<p>This would explain why the threshold for tza'ar ba'alei chaim is so low, and why Rabbi Yechezqeil Landau frames going beyond that threshold in terms of duties of personal character development.</p>\n\n<p>But it only goes half-way to explaining why G-d would set up a natural order that is so competitive and brutal. If animals can't suffer in this sense of the word, it explains why He was unconcerned with animal suffering. But it doesn't explain why Hashem was unconcerned with leaving that around as as something humans may take a lesson from. Social Darwinism, or Nietzche, or Objectivism are all based on the fallacy that looking out for myself and my power is more important than caring for the weak. As Nietzche put it, the weak take up resources, the strong and bright contribute to the community more than they take up.</p>\n\n<p>But that's as far as I know how to take your question. I would be dissatisfied with the answer \"as a challenge to overcome\". As though Hashem makes being good harder for us for the fun of it. Meanwhile, evolution works at getting many things done -- we have complex life. We have to learn how to balance today's disease with creating the threat of tomorrow's superbugs. I just don't know out of the infinite possibilities open to the Creator Who even got to choose the laws of nature to work with, why one that sets so many examples we shouldn't follow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Why would an omnipotent God create a vicious food chain and unforgiving evolutionary process when a \"kinder\" perfectly-functioning model could have been implemented?</em></p>\n\n<p>What kinder and perfectly-functioning model are  you suggesting?

Why doesn't your personal justification answer why Hashem   allows it?</p>\n\n<p>While one can ask  so why doesn't meat and leather grow on trees and why isn't the ecological balance kept without predatory animals etc. such questions really boil down to why didn't Hashem make a world simple enough for everyone to understand the hows and the whys of everything he does.</p>\n\n<p>One would expect a  more complex world than that from G-d</p>\n\n\n",

But I think the Midrash is highlighting one part.</p>\n<p>Also note about blessing the animals:\nThe Gur Aryeh mentions that after the flood another blessing is given to the animals, this will cover the land animals; however, since the snake is now cursed it will remain cursed.</p>\n<p>Bereishis 8:17</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כׇּל־הַחַיָּ֨ה אֲשֶֽׁר־אִתְּךָ֜ מִכׇּל־בָּשָׂ֗ר בָּע֧וֹף וּבַבְּהֵמָ֛ה וּבְכׇל־הָרֶ֛מֶשׂ הָרֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל־הָאָ֖רֶץ (הוצא) [הַיְצֵ֣א] אִתָּ֑ךְ וְשָֽׁרְצ֣וּ בָאָ֔רֶץ וּפָר֥וּ וְרָב֖וּ עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃ Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: birds, animals, and everything that creeps on earth; and let them swarm on the earth and be fertile and increase on earth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can see that all animals are included.</p>\n\n\n",

To me this looks completely contrary to the custom of praying in the direction of the Sanctuary. Even more so, because the square before the Kotel has the halachic status of a Synagogue. Why then do they turn their back towards the Kotel? The reason can hardly be to face the public, for today there is no public because of the Corona lockdown. But even if this would be the reason it seems wrong. For in the Synagogue they don't face the public but the Aron HaKodesh. It seems therefore that they should face the Kotel.</p>\n\n\n",

What pleasure is this?)\" [Yose] said to him: \"And if so receive those who followed His will, then even more so to those who angered Him!\" And these words entered him like the venom of a snake, and so he went and fulfilled upon himself the four deaths of the court: stoning, burning, slaughter and hanging, what did he do? He brought a stake, stabbed it in the ground, tied to it a rope, prepared the sticks and surrounded them with a fence of stones, and he made a pyre before that fence and stuck the sword in the center and he lighted the fire beneath the sticks beneath the stones, and he hung himself from the stake and was choked, and the fire came upon him, and the rope was cut, and he fell to the fire, and the sword welcomed him, and the fence fell upon him and he was burned.

Something of a drashic basis he finds in the teachings of Yose ben Yochanan and Yose ben Yoezer, because both spoke about the importance of the house:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yose ben Yoezer used to say: let thy house be a house of meeting for the Sages and sit in the very dust of their feet, and drink in their words with thirst. Yose ben Yochanan (a man) of Jerusalem used to say: Let thy house be wide open, and let the poor be members of thy household.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.4-5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 1:4-5</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Chanukah has a certain focus on the \"house\": \"נר איש וביתו\", the Temple - the \"house of Hashem\", etc.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Elisha Aviner also <a href=\"https://www.tzohar.org.il/?p=2724\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes similarly</a> that their focus on the house shows that they viewed the house as a spiritual center and base. Yose ben Yoezer thought that the way to fix the house would be to fill it with Torah, while Yose ben Yochanan thought the solution was to fill it with good middot.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we may view their teachings as an attempt to rally the Jews to fight off the Greeks and the Hellenistic Jews, especially in order to save the Mikdash, but also in general, to save Am Yisrael from the negative spiritual influence of the Greeks. It's possible that their attempts to empower the Jews did have some influence in getting Jews to join the Chashmonaim.</p>\n<p>Ben Tzion Luria, on the other hand, thought that the teachings of Yose ben Yoezer and Yose ben Yochanan were not merely reflections of their hashkafot of the era, but reflected real ordinances passed by them, due to situations that arose during the time. In his book on Megillat Taanit, he wrote (pg. 41-42, my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"He [Yose ben Yoezer] taught: \"Let thy house be a house of meeting for the Sages\", and wished to say: Since during the time of the destruction (שמד) the official house of meeting could not operate continuously due to the persecution from the Hellenist Jews, every person must gather sages in his own home, so that the Torah will not be lost from Yisrael.</p>\n<p>From him we've received a fascinating <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Eduyot.8.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishna</a>, preserved in Aramaic as it was spoken by him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabbi Yose ben Yoezer, a man of Zereda, testified concerning the ayal-locust, that it is pure...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ayal-kamtza is a type of locust. It appears that this ruling was a temporary one (הוראת שעה), to ease the livelihood of the congregation of pietists and their families<sup>1</sup>, who would escape from the city to the Judean Desert and didn't have what to eat. Because this was an emergency, and due to the war there were many dead bodies strewn in the land and it was difficult to maintain the purity laws correctly, Yose was lenient and taught that he who touches a dead body is impure only until the evening and not for seven days. In later generations, he was called \"Yose Sharia\", meaning, Yose the permitter...</p>\n<p>And similarly, it seems, that also from the teachings of his friend Yose ben Yochanan, man of Yerushalayim we hear the echoes of the tribulations. He used to say: \"Let thy house be wide open, and let the poor be members of thy household\", and he was referring to the pietists who had become poor, having escaped from their homes due to the Syrian and Hellenist Jewish persecutors. There were so many during the time of Yose ben Yochanan, that he taught that one should bring these people into one's home and assist them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> According to Maccabees, the first people to join Matityahu and his sons were of a group called \"chassidim\", pietists. They're mentioned, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_I.7.12?vhe=%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D_-_%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%96%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9C_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9C&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_II.14.8?vhe=%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D_-_%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%96%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9C_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9C&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Chanukah story in general spanned enough time to have taken place during the leadership of more than one pair of zugos.</p>\n<p>It started during the time of Yose ben Yoezer (who was murdered by the Greeks for teaching Torah publicly Breishis Rabba 65:22) and Yose Ben Yochnon</p>\n<p>The (righteous part of the) Chasmonaim dynasty ended during the time of Yeshoua Ben Parachia and Nitia Harbeli.</p>\n<p>Why the zugos themselves didn't lead the revolt could be for any number of reasons but for one thing they probably were under  a lot more Greek surveillance than Matisyahu and his five sons who lived  in a small city and were less well known to the Greeks</p>\n\n\n",

A  בּוֹר סוּד is one who regurgitates without adding new material. A מַעְיָן הַמִּתְגַּבֵּר does not just regurgitate, but is innovative. It may be true that Rabbi Elazar ben Arach was able to incorporate all the other teachings, however, he did so by creating his own, original formulation. He was able to take teachings, and on is own, distill them into something new that incorporated all of them.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, a בּוֹר סוּד might have just repeated all the other opinions. Only a מַעְיָן הַמִּתְגַּבֵּר could find a new way of expressing the essence of what everyone else was saying.</p>\n\n\n",

Just not the same level as murdering orphan children. </p>\n\n<p>2) Alternatively, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.94.6?lang=bi&p2=Romemot_El_on_Psalms.94.6.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Romemus E-l on Tehillim (94:6)</a> writes </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובראותם שעל אלה לא תפקוד יגעו גם במי שנתייחדת לדיין היא אלמנה כי אתה\n  ה' דיין אלמנות ובראותם שלא תחוש יגעו במי שתאהב הוא הגר כמד\"א ואוהב גר\n  כו' ובראותם שלא תפקוד עליהם יגעו גם במי שאתה מיוחד לו לאב הוא היתום\n  וזהו ויתומים ירצחו אשר אתה ה' אבי יתומים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The word used for widows and converts is referring to Hashem stepping in as the Judge meting out הרג as a death penalty. On the other hand, the word used for orphans is calling on Hashem to avenge their death in the role as Father of the orphans.   </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we have an explicit rule of Safek Brachos Lehakel if we already have a greater encompassing rule of Safek D'Rabanan L'kulah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that Safek brachos lehakel might simply be a corollary of Safek D'rabana L'kulah, however I assume there is some nafka minah between the two. The only reason we would have safek brachos lehakel is to teach us something that we may otherwise not have known had we only had the rule of Safek D'rabanan L'kulah. My question is: what hava amina might we have had if we only knew Safek D'rabanan L'kulah, that we needed Safek Brachos Lehakel to teach us otherwise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>By brachos we have a couple different issues which need to be balanced. There's the obligation of making the right bracha before eating, the prohibition of eating without a bracha, and the prohibition of making a wrong bracha (using Hashem's name in vain.)</p>\n\n<p>The gemara Brachos daf 12a discusses the case of a person who takes a cup of beer and mistakenly thinks that it's wine. He starts to make the bracha \"baruch ata…\" planning on concluding the bracha \"borei pri hagefen\", but after saying \"haolam\" realizes that it's beer and concludes \"shehakol.\" (I'm avoiding the machlokes in the pshat gemara since it's not relevant for this question.)</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos d.h. \"lo\" points out that the gemara doesn't clearly render a ruling in this case. He quotes the Rif ruling \"leniently\" that even in this case you fulfill your obligation. Then he quotes the Ri who rules \"stringently\" that you need to make the blessing again (i.e the stringency is that you did not fulfill your obligation.)</p>\n\n<p>In the gilyon Hashas there R' Akiva Eiger brings the question of the Magen Avraham- how can you rule \"lechumra\" the general rule is \"Safek Brachos Lekulah?</p>\n\n<p>He answers the question by using the concept of the Maharsha in pesachim: we only say safek brachos lekulah regarding a safek birchas hamitzvah. Since we poskim that birkas hamitzvah is not meakev (meaning that even if you don't make the bracha before doing the mitzvah, you still fulfill your obligation of the mitzvah) therefore when in doubt don't make the bracha.</p>\n\n<p>However, regarding birchos hanehenin (brachos before enjoying something like food) we have another rule: you're not allowed to eat without making a bracha (asur lehanos ba'olam hazeh bli bracha.) Therefore the Ri holds that you need to be machmir on that prohibition (of not eating without a bracha) and therefore make a new bracha. \n(Rak\"a says it's not a chashash bracha levatala since you can't eat without making the bracha.)</p>\n\n<p>Rak\"a on that spot refers to what he wrote on Tosfos daf 49b. There, the Ri says to be \"machmir\" and make a borei nefashos on a drink which is less than a kezayis.\nRak\"a there asks- how can you be machmir, the rule is safek brachos lehakel?\nSince on the bracha achrona there's no problem of eating without a prior bracha, we revert back to the general rule of safek brachos lekula.</p>\n\n<p>From the machlokes between the rif and the ri (As explained by Rak\"a) we see the rule of safek brachos lehakel isn't a simple ruling based on safek derabanan lehakel.</p>\n\n<p>There's an additional aspect of safek brachos lehakel- when you don't know what the bracha is, you need to make the more general bracha.\ni.e. if you're not sure if it's a fruit or a vegetable, make a ha'adama. \nSee <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/34814/21984\">here</a> for a discussion of the sources.</p>\n\n<p>When I make the ha'adama instead of the ha'etz, out of doubt, what is the leniency? \nHere, the leniency is on making the proper bracha.\nIf the bracha should have been haetz, and I made ha'adama, I have been lenient regarding my chiyuv to make the better (more specific) bracha.</p>\n\n<p>But I have to be lenient about that, since if I err the other way- I make haetz when it should have been ha'adama- I'm saying sheker and the bracha doesn't count. Thus it ends up that I'm not making any bracha, and I'm eating without a bracha!</p>\n\n<p>Here, we see again that this discussion of safek brachos lehakel is not necessarily related to the question of safek derabanan lehakel.</p>\n\n<p>When the gemara states (35a) that it's forbidden to eat without making a bracha first, it's not clear that it has the status of a torah prohibition.\nBut yet we see that we use the principle of safek brachos lehakel even when we're considering various rabbinic obligations and prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>[worthy of mentioning- Some poskim, including Rav Shternbuch in Shu\"t teshuvos v'hanhagos (I think chelek beis) explain that the issur of benefiting without making a bracha doesn't require an actual halachic bracha. Thus, he rules that if a person isn't sure if he needs to make a bracha (maybe he already made a bracha, maybe he didn't) that he should think the bracha in his mind. While it doesn't fulfill the chiyuv of making a bracha, it does remove the issur of eating without one. Thus on the bracha itself we can revert to the regular rule of safek brachos lehakel.</p>\n\n<p>This is again an example of how various aspects of hilchos brachos come together, and it's not enough to simply say safek derabanan lekulah.] </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Penei_Yehoshua_on_Berakhot.12a.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Penei Yehoshua to Berachot 12a</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הא דקיי\"ל בעלמא ספיקא דרבנן לקולא לאו כלל גמור הוא דהא בכמה דוכתי פוסק הש\"ס לחומרא אף בדרבנן היכי דאיכא טעמא</p>\n<p>That which we rule in general that <em>sefeika derabbanan lekula</em> is not an absolute principle, as there are many places where the Talmud rules stringently even in a <em>derabbanan</em>, where there is reason to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to note that there may be specific reasons why one would think to rule stringently in certain cases of doubtful <em>berachot</em> (and, in fact, Ri does rule that way).</p>\n<p>Thus the principle of <em>safek berachot lehakel</em> could be telling us that we do indeed apply <em>sefeika derabbanan lekula</em> in cases of <em>berachot</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simple answer is because Safek drabanan likula means you could be lenient and can make a bracha if you wants to.\nSafek brachos lihakel is saying it's forbidden to make a blessing in doubt.</p>\n\n\n",

It mentions a fact that I found astonishing (I suppose many others knew it already!): during that entire period, the Aron Hakodesh was not in the Mishkan at all.

[See update below.] It's really like: Some more amazing things I found out about bamos, that help me to feel that my question maybe isn't so bad.<br>\n1) Though the gemara in Megillah 9b talks about R' Shimon, actually four of five tanaim (according to Rashi and Tos.) on Zevachim 117a hold that you can't bring <em>any</em> korbon yachid even on the bamah gedolah (i.e., Gilgal, Nov, or Giv'on), except olos and shlamim. R' Yehudah is the daas yachid who says that you can bring all korbonos on the main bamah. All other tanaim hold that you can't bring a chatas or asham <i>at all</i>. No bechoros, no maaser beheimah...<br>\n2) According to Tosefos there (117b, td\"h v'rabanon), you couldn't bring a mincha or birds either (for most tanaim) or a korbon for nazirus. Not anywhere. No one could finish their nazirus - see Tosefos about Avshalom.<br>\n3) The main bamah was not called \"לפני ה'\" according to one opinion in the gemara (119a).<br>\n4) The gemara on 119b, one meaning of \"המנוחה\" is \"where the Aron Hakodesh finally came to rest\" (if מנוחה means Yerushalayim, see there).<br>\nMy conclusion from all this: The time of heter bamos was a little bit (forgive my exaggerated language) <i>pathetic</i>. Pardon me, but they couldn't bring a chatas for 57 years?  Brings new meaning to the phrase in the haggadah, Beis Habechirah l'chaper al kol avonoseinu. During the previous time, no one could get kapparah through a korbon.<br>\nWe are used to looking at that time from a world where we can't bring anything, and they had so much more. But in their world, it was kind of like not having a Beis Hamikdash at all. They had not reached the place \"where the Aron would rest\"; there just wasn't any point to moving it to bring it to a temporary location.  </p>\n\n<p>Update: Now I see that the Radak asks my question, and answers it too, Shmuel II 6:17,<br>\nולמה לא הביא דוד את הארון לגבעון שהיה שם אהל מועד לפי שידע כי אהל מועד היה עתיד לבא לירושלים...<br>\nThis should go at the top, but I'm leaving the discussion above it since I ב\"ה was מכוון a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, I'm still somewhat bothered: David says to the navi (ibid, 7:2)\nאָנֹכִי יוֹשֵׁב בְּבֵית אֲרָזִים וַאֲרוֹן הָאֱלֹהִים ישֵׁב בְּתוֹךְ הַיְרִיעָה\n\"I sit in a house of cedar, and the Aron of G-d sits within curtains.\" (See the Radak there for why he's mentioning the Aron, instead of the Mishkan.) As you can see from the navi's answer, this is a question on the entire history, including Shiloh, not just Nov and Giv'on: even Shiloh had curtains above. David doesn't seem concerned with the temporary problem of Nov and Giv'on, just with the ultimate fix.<br>\nAnd indeed, when the navi tells him to wait and his son will build the Bayis, David doesn't rethink it and isn't bothered; everything is left where it is until the Beis Hamikdash is built. Shiloh is gone, Yerushalayim is not yet; I guess there is no way to improve matters until Hashem gives the okay.</p>\n\n\n",

[When] a quaestor saw him, he fled before him, whereupon he gave pursuit. As he overtook him he [Elisha] removed them from his head and held them in his hand. 'What is that in your hand?' he demanded. 'The wings of a dove,' was his reply. He stretched out his hand and lo! they were the wings of a dove. Therefore he is called 'Elisha the man of the wings'. And why the wings of a dove rather than that of other birds? Because the Congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is said, as the wings of a dove covered with silver: just as a dove is protected by its wings, so is Israel protected by the precepts.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_49.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=53b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 53b</a> records a different story with the same punchline about a dove's wings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבה בב\"ח הוה קאזל בשיירתא אכל ואשתלי ולא בריך אמר היכי אעביד אי אמינא להו אנשאי לברך אמרי לי בריך כל היכא דמברכת לרחמנא מברכת מוטב דאמינא להו אנשאי יונה דדהבא אמר להו אנטרו לי דאנשאי יונה דדהבא אזיל ובריך ואשכח יונה דדהבא ומאי שנא יונה דמתילי כנסת ישראל ליונה דכתיב כנפי יונה נחפה בכסף ואברותיה בירקרק חרוץ מה יונה אינה ניצולת אלא בכנפיה אף ישראל אינן ניצולין אלא במצות</p>\n<p>Rabbah b. Bar Hanah was once travelling with a caravan, and he took a meal and forgot to say grace. He said to himself: What shall I do? If I say to the others, I have forgotten to say grace, they will say to me, Say it [here]: wherever you say the benediction you are saying it to the All-Merciful. I had better tell them that I have forgotten a golden dove. So he said to them: Wait for me, because I have forgotten a golden dove. He went back and said grace and found a golden dove. Why should it have been just a dove? — Because the community of Israel are compared to a dove, as it is written, The wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold. Just as the dove is saved only by her wings, so Israel are saved only by the precepts.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_53.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there appears to be an interesting difference in how the verse about doves is expounded in these two incidents. In the version in Shabbat the wings of a dove, and by exposition the <em>mitzvot</em>, are said to \"protect\" (מגינות) while in Berachot they are said to \"save\" (ניצול).</p>\n<p>Now one might wish to simply suggest that there is no real difference between these passages, and the terms are in fact synonymous. However, the Talmud in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=21&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 21a</a> explicitly distinguishes between \"protecting\" and \"saving\" in the context of <em>mitzvot</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יוסף מצוה בעידנא דעסיק בה מגנא ומצלא בעידנא דלא עסיק בה אגוני מגנא אצולי לא מצלא תורה בין בעידנא דעסיק בה ובין בעידנא דלא עסיק בה מגנא ומצלא מתקיף לה רבה אלא מעתה דואג ואחיתופל מי לא עסקי בתורה אמאי לא הגינה עלייהו אלא אמר רבא תורה בעידנא דעסיק בה מגנא ומצלא בעידנא דלא עסיק בה אגוני מגנא אצולי לא מצלא מצוה בין בעידנא דעסיק בה בין בעידנא דלא עסיק בה אגוני מגנא אצולי לא מצלא</p>\n<p>Said R. Joseph: A commandment protects and rescues  while one is engaged upon it; but when one is no longer engaged upon it, it protects but does not rescue. As for [study of] Torah, whether while one is engaged upon it or not, it protects and rescues. Raba demurred to this: According to this reasoning, did not Doeg and Ahitophel engage upon [study of] Torah; so Why did it not protect them?  — But, said Raba, while one is engaged upon [study of] Torah, it protects and rescues, and while one is not engaged upon it, it protects but does not rescue. As for a commandment whether while one is engaged upon it or not, it protects but does not rescue.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/sotah/sotah_21.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given the passage in Sotah, are we forced to say that the passages in Shabbat and Berachot are actually disagreeing about what <em>mitzvot</em> (and a dove's wings) can accomplish? Or do both passages reject the distinction made in Sotah? Or is there some way to reconcile all three passages? Have any commentators discussed this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi on Sotah 21 explains that מגנא ('protect') means protection from misfortune, and מצלא ('rescue') means moral protection from further challenges.</p>\n\n<p>In the story from Shabbat 49 Elisha was in immediate danger, so it makes sense to use the term מגנא. In the second story about Rabbah b. Bar Hanah he was not in any immediate danger, and the doves symbolized the moral value of being exceptionally particularly about the mitzvos, so מצלא is more fitting.</p>\n\n\n",

From their perspective, even if they agree that the interpretations of their church are wrong, they are still obligated to follow because their church officials are <strong><em>their</em></strong> equivalent to Rabbinical authority. Thus, they follow because the authority is what is being respected and not necessarily the idea being presented.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi makes a claim that establishes the authority of the Rabbis:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ימין ושמאל. אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל יָמִין שֶׁהוּא שְׂמֹאל וְעַל\n  שְׂמֹאל שֶׁהוּא יָמִין, וְכָל שֶׁכֵּן שֶׁאוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל יָמִין יָמִין\n  וְעַל שְׂמֹאל שְׂמֹאל (ספרי):</p>\n  \n  <p>even if he (the judge) tells you about what appears to you to be right\n  that it is left, or about what appears to you to be left that it is\n  right, you have to obey him; how much the more is this so if actually\n  he tells you about what is evidently right that it is right and about\n  what is left that it is left</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>This establishes the idea that a Jew is obligated to follow the authority of the Rabbis even if it is crystal clear that the Rabbi got it wrong.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>As Jews, We are taught the importance of Rabbinical authority. We are taught that our Rabbinical authority is derived from the same court system established by Moshe Rebbeinu as directed by Hashem. This makes it divinely established and thus we must follow that authority. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is simple.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using this same logic from their perspective. Can it be argued that a person born into a Catholic situation and having this same yearning to submit to authority <strong><em>(which they believe to be divinely established)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Can it be argued that they are pious and G-d-fearing even if they have been misled? Can it be argued that because they aren't knowingly turning against G-d but genuinely believe in full rationality that this way is the best way to honor G-d that they aren't necessarily treated the same as other idol worshippers?</p>\n\n<p>What I mean is when someone knows Hashem is G-d and they choose other faiths and traditions over Hashem, that is a separate thing from a Catholic born into a situation to believe that their Church authority is <strong><em>their</em></strong> equivalent to Rabbinical authority.

We should not seek converts nor try to put Christians in a situation where they become alienated from their family and community. Unless they choose to seek the G-d of Israel independently, they should remain with their church and heed its authority as necessary. They are innocent dupes who have been misled, and G-d will judge them by their deeds, not creed. However, once a Christian is told the truth, they become responsible for their behavior. The authority \"thing\" only works so long as they are ignorant.</p>\n\n\n",

The basic rule of blessings is that wine/grape juice, fruits from the seven species, and the five grain products get a special after blessing known as \"<em>Me'ein Shalosh</em>\". If one had a combination of these three categories, they wouldn't make three separate blessings, rather they would combine them all into one.</p>\n\n<p>A common scenario is at a <em>Kiddush</em>, someone will have a sip of wine/grape juice. They will then have the requisite amount of grain (<em>mezonos</em>), so that they'll fulfill the requirement to eat where they heard <em>Kiddush</em>. They will then have to make a <em>Me'ein Shalosh</em>, saying <em>Al HaMichya</em> for grain. However, they didn't have the requisite amount of wine/grape juice to make <em>Me'ein Shalosh</em> for wine/grape juice. Could they, or should they, still include the phrase <em>Al HaGefen</em> for having drunk wine/grape juice? Or would they include that only if they had the requisite amount.</p>\n\n<p>I seem to recall this is a dispute among the <em>Poskim</em>, but I don't remember where I read this. I'm curious for the relevant sources, and what the common practice is. My imagination is most people include it anyways.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If the 'sip' you drank at the kiddush was a shot glass (as I've often seen done in such a setting) where the contents of the cup may be a kezayis at least according to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37650/13811\">some</a> authorities, in which case the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.210.1?lang=bi&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch (210:1)</a> says there is a doubt if one is obligated in an after blessing, then the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Adam.50.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Adam (50:21)</a> mentions this case: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שתה יין בכזית ואם כן הוא ספק אם יברך ב\"א כיון שהוא פחות מרביעית. וכן\n  שתה יין ונסתפק אם בירך ב\"א ואין לו יין מותר לו לאכול כזית מדברים\n  שמברכין עליו על המחיה ויכלול בתוכה ג\"כ על הגפן אע\"ג דלכתחילה היה אסור\n  לשתות דבר שהוא מסופק אם הוא יין וכיוצא בו כדי לכלול בעל המחיה וכיוצא\n  בו מ\"מ כיון שכבר אכל או שתה והוא מסופק ואין לו מאותו המין לתקן יכול\n  לכלול מספק - One who drink a kezayis of wine and is thereby uncertain if he can make a bracha achrona since he drank less than a reviis, also one who drinks wine and isn't sure if he made a bracha achrona and has no more wine to drink, then it is permitted to eat a kezayis of other foods requiring an al hamichya to include the wine drunk into the bracha achrona with al hamichya v'al pri hagafen.

There is no bracha achrona for wine/grape juice when less than a kezayis is drunk, and we cannot add additional insertions to the obligatory al hamichya without a halachically legitimate reason - like to potentially remove ourselves from a questionable bracha achrona.

Cain told him about the power of teshuva, how a person can come back to G-d even after sinning. That causes Adam to do teshuva as well.</p>\n\n<p>So we don't view Cain as this evil, irredeemable figure. Rather he messed up and did teshuva. This actually fits well with R' Akiva, who teaches us that even a person who starts growing and learning late in life can become great. It's never to late to start again. (R' Akiva was 40 years old when he started learning Torah.)</p>\n\n<p>I acknowledge I didn't answer your question specifically, but I think in general terms I addressed your underlying question. Without addressing how they are connected, you can know at least appreciate and understand how they could be connected at all.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Leaning (heseiba) on Pesach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>related to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/6812/a-leaning-dilemma\">this</a> question</p>\n\n<p>The halacha requires that on Pesach, when drinking at least the first 2 cups of wine or eating the matzah for the mitzvah, a person leans. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.472.7?lang=bi&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S\"A</a> (O\"C 472:7) codifies it as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל מי שצריך הסיבה אם אכל או שתה בלא הסיבה לא יצא וצריך לחזור לאכול ולשתות בהסיבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But when sitting with certain people, including one's Rav Muvhak, there seems to be the possibility that, if told NOT to lean (or not given explicit permission TO lean -- אא\"כ יתן לו רבו רשות), one does not lean.</p>\n\n<p>My Daf Hayomi B'Halacha email wrote these two statements -- the first about leaning in the presence of one's father and the second, in the presence of a Rebbe</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>The Poskim disagree whether a son is permitted to lean in front of his father if the father insists that the son not do so. Some rule that the son may not lean in opposition to his father’s wishes, while others say that the father’s opinion is negated due to the fact that the average parent has no issue with his child leaning in front of him.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>If the teacher permits the student to lean, the student must do so. The permission must be explicit and cannot be assumed. </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But if the obligation to lean is on the level of halacha -- so much so that not leaning means one has not discharged his obligation, then being bound by the dictate of the father or the Rebbe would stop someone from being yotzei an obligation. The <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2041\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halacha yomit</a> site writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah further states (Vayikra 19), “Each man shall revere his mother and father and you shall keep My Shabbat,” to teach us that if one’s father commands him to desecrate the Shabbat, the child may not obey his father, for the father is likewise obligated to honor Hashem who has commanded to observe the holy Shabbat. The same applies to any other Mitzvot in that if one’s parents command him to transgress any of the Torah’s commandments or that of the Sages, one may not obey them, for they are also obligated to keep these commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Among other reasons, I can imagine that the dictate of divrei harav, divrei hatalmid, divrei mi shom'im might also apply.</p>\n\n<p>How can there be any opinion that says that in the face of a particular element which is a sine qua non of proper fulfillment of a mitzvah, one can be forbidden to perform it by someone? Is it because of some difference between an aseh and a lo ta'aseh (or a shev v'al ta'aseh)? The answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67544/1362\">here</a> uses the language of ANY commandment.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question is assuming that I have a mitzvah to fulfill (leaning) and my rebbe muvhak (or father) is commanding me not to fulfill it. Framed in this way, the question is very strong- we don't listen to our teachers or parents to negate halacha.</p>\n\n<p>But really the assumption isn't correct.\nThis really is a case of two halachos which clash with each other, and the question is which one overrides the other one.</p>\n\n<p>There is a mitzvah to have reverence for one's rebbe which prevents one from leaning in his presence.\nThere's another halacha which requires me to lean in order to fulfill my mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>We now have a question- which mitzvah takes precedence?\nThis is where the halacha that you quoted from is coming from- the commandment of reverence for one's rebbe takes precedence over the leaning.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the rebbe can permit the talmid to lean is a separate point. As brought down in Y.D. 240 (for a parent) and Y.D. 242 (for a rebbe) a parent or rebbe can be \"mochel\" their honor, they are allowed to permit the child/student to not honor them. This is referring to not fulfilling actions to honor them, not actively disgracing them. (that's a separate discussion.)</p>\n\n<p>As the poskim say based on the yerushalmi (quoted by Tosfos in kidushin daf 31b) רצונו זהו כבודו fulfilling a person's desires is honoring them.\nThus is a parent can tell a child that they forgo the honor due to them, and the child is allowed not to honor them.\n(I'm summarizing a big discussion about how mechilas kavod works; Rav Scheinberg zatza\"l has a couple of points in Mishmeres Chaim, and there's a lot of points ואכמ\"ל)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when a parent or rebbe allows a child to lean, they are in effect removing the mitzvah of reverence. Thus, the student/child is left only with the mitzvah of leaning which they fulfill.</p>\n\n<p>This is the way to understand the halacha which you quoted. \nIt's not that the rebbe tells the student to violate halacha, but rather that the normative halacha places reverence for one's teacher above the mitzvah of leaning, absence permission and \"mechila\" from the rebbe.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nI want to add a detail to further clarify this point. \nIn the famous story brought in sefer Shmuel I chapt. 18, it describes Yonason sitting at a seudah with his father Shaul Hamelech but with Dovid missing. (This is the haftarah of \"machar chodesh.\")</p>\n\n<p>In verse 25 it says that Yonason sat Avner in place of Dovid, in between himself and his father.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi and the Metzudos bring there that it's not the derech for children to lean next to their father; thus Yonason wanted to have someone in between.</p>\n\n<p>From here the poskim discuss having a child sit next to one's parent. (The Mishna berurah siman 90 brings the chayei adam that child should not sit next to one's parent, the same way a talmid should not sit next to a rebbe muvhak. The minhag is not like this, but rather like the Aruch Hashulchan that I'll bring in a moment.)</p>\n\n<p>The ben ish chai (in his hilchos kivud av v'em, I believe parshas mishpatim shana shniya) discusses this issue. He concludes that it's only a problem of leaning, which is more relaxed. But just sitting next to one's parents is not a problem. (He himself points out that for Pesach when we do lean, it would be a problem to do so next to one's parents.)</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan, in Y.D 240, says that it's only a problem for bnei melachim to be next to their parents. for non-royalty it's not a problem. I saw discussion years back that this could still be a problem for leil Haseder, since on Pesach night we do act as royalty in certain ways.</p>\n\n<p>based on this idea, we can explain why we wouldn't recline next to our rebbeim or our parents at the seder.\nWe recline to show our freedom and cherus. But it's not derech cherus to recline when it would be disrespectful.</p>\n\n<p>Thus when we have a mitzvah to recline leil haseder, but we also have a mitzvah of reverence for our parents and rebbeim, the reverence will win out.\nIt wins out since as long as there is a mitzvah of reverence, there is no custom of leaning and thus no mitzvah to do so. </p>\n\n<p>And of course, once the parents and rebbeim give permission, it goes back to being derech cherus and one must now lean.\n(Melachim cannot be mochel on their kavod, but parents and rebbeim can as is clear from Y.D. 240, 242, 244 based on the gemara kidushin 32b).</p>\n\n\n",

That “name” is Dikarnosa (דיקרנוסא), which apparently comes from Malachi 3:10, though it is difficult to see how other than the appearance of the word די in the verse.

As far as I am aware, it is not incumbent upon a Noachide Gentile to pursue conversion. Thus I can only conclude that one cannot define 'right-doing' as the degree to which a person adheres to the highest known standard of behaviour. How, therefore, ought one to define Right and Wrong? If a Gentile can be righteous outside of full Torah observance, does that mean that 'right-doing' is a matter of a person's good-will or good-intention rather than a matter of observable behaviour?</p>\n\n<p>(I know there were quite heated debates about this matter in the Church in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Peter Abelard was one who declared that a person's righteousness was a matter of the purity and goodness of their intentions rather than anything they may actually do. Have similar debates taken place within Israel, and if so, can someone point me to them?)</p>\n\n<p>Just for context: I am a goy seeking to convert, and find myself - probably on account of my sins - in a kind of 'double-bind' scenario: I cannot reconcile these axioms: (1) A Man ought to do what is right; (2) The Torah tells me what is right; (3) I am not obligated to do all the Torah.

That's a lot more intense, requiring tremendous sensitivity and significant attention to detail. it's very hard to live up to the standards of that relationship.</p>\n\n<p>So when you ask yourself what is \"right\" regarding converting or not, the question can be rephrased: Do I think I can handle the intense obligations which come from such a close relationship?</p>\n\n<p>Am I ready to get \"married\" or is it better for me to remain a faithful friend?</p>\n\n<p>No one will force you into \"marriage\" and for many non-jews it makes sense to stay friends. \nSo in this regard there is no \"objective right or wrong answer.\"</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, this is really a life principle.\nFrom a Jewish perspective, is it \"right\" to become an accountant?\nThere is no answer \"yes\" or \"no\" which is true for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>It will depend on each person's aptitude, skill set, environment, alternative professional options, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Yet Judaism will definitely say that for some people it is the \"right thing to do\" i.e. those people who will benefit from the steady job and will be able to contribute their skills to helping others.</p>\n\n<p>And it will be \"wrong\" for other people- like a person who would be better off teaching a classroom and instead is stuck working as a CPA behind a desk, with their pedagogy skills languishing.</p>\n\n<p>Right and wrong are not fixed, yet there is still a right or wrong answer to every question and every possible action.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true over here- you are not obligated by the Torah, yet the Torah principles will still dictate what is right or wrong to do, and you are supposed to do what's right.)</p>\n\n<p>One other perspective (another aspect of the above):</p>\n\n<p>The question is asked how could Sodom have received such tremendous punishment for their wickedness if the Torah had not been given? How could they have known that they were so bad and immoral if the Torah defines morality and it wasn't given yet?</p>\n\n<p>I saw an answer years ago in the name of the Ramban (Nachmanides- but I don't know where he writes it) that people have an intellect which is capable of deciding the proper course of action.</p>\n\n<p>You don't need prophecy to know that stealing and sexual immorality is wrong. people are held accountable for not using proper common sense and for not arriving at correct intellectual conclusions even though they are not obligated in the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>The basic principles of \"right and wrong\" can be derived from clear thinking, and this the intellectual basis for the Noahide laws. This is why they are binding upon all people, even those who have no access to the written Torah.</p>\n\n<p>It's the basic code of morality, which means being the kind of person who has some connection with G-d (in a \"friend\" way, as mentioned above. There's a minimal level of connection.)</p>\n\n<p>Via the Revelation at Mount Sinai and through learning and fulfilling the Torah, a person can become not just \"moral\" but \"Holy\"- there's the concept of kedusha. \nThis is what the commandments are for, and this creates that intense \"marriage\" relationship with G-d which is possible only through becoming Jewish.\n(In fact, the term for marriage in Judaism is \"kidushin\"- a wife becomes \"sanctified\" to her husband.)</p>\n\n<p>So the basic level of \"moral right and wrong\" can be obtained even without the Torah. But the \"holiness right and wrong\" requires the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The seven Noahide laws are applicable to all mankind:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: Seven precepts were the sons of Noah commanded: To establish courts of justice; and refrain from blasphemy, idolatry, adultery, murder, stealing, and eating the flesh of live animals.. [Sanhedrin 56a-b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jews must observe the 613 commandments in the Torah.  Gentiles must observe the seven Noahide laws.  Gentiles may study Torah or observe Shabbat only partially. [Sanhedrin 58b-59a]  For all other commandments (kashrut, mikvah, honoring parents, offering sacrifices, refraining from certain mixtures, etc.), it is up to them whether to observe them or not.</p>\n<p>Note that Jews do not feel the need to proselytize.  Judaism is not an “upgrade”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The righteous of all nations have a share in the World to Come. [Tosefta Sanhedrin 13, based on Sanhedrin 105a]</p>\n<p>I call heaven and earth as witnesses: Any individual, whether Gentile or Jew, man or woman, servant or maid, can bring the Divine Presence upon himself in accordance with his deeds.

The Talmud [Sanhedrin 75a] recounts this story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was an incident involving a certain man who set his eyes upon a certain woman and passion rose in his heart [and he became deathly ill]. And they came and asked doctors [what to do]. And the doctors said: He will be cured only if she has sex with him.</p>\n<p>-The Sages said: Let him die.  She may not have sex with him.</p>\n<p>-The doctors said: She should at least stand naked before him.</p>\n<p>-The Sages said: Let him die.  She may not stand naked before him.</p>\n<p>-The doctors suggested: The woman should at least talk with him behind a fence in a secluded area.</p>\n<p>-The Sages insisted: Let him die.  She may not converse with him behind a fence.</p>\n<p>[An objection: If the woman is married, the matter is understood.  But if she is single] let the man marry her [if she agrees]. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: His mind will not be eased by marriage, as it is stated:\nStolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. [Prov. 9:17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Rabbi Yitzhak decided that only <strong>illicit</strong> sex could have cured the man.  On what basis did he make that assertion?  In most cases, a man in that situation would be happy if the woman agreed to marry him.  The problem arises only if she does not want to marry him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>This question is based on a misquote of the Talmud. Here is the actual text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולינסבה מינסב לא מייתבה דעתיה כדר' יצחק דא\"ר יצחק מיום שחרב בית המקדש ניטלה טעם ביאה וניתנה לעוברי עבירה שנאמר (משלי ט, יז) מים גנובים ימתקו ולחם סתרים ינע</p>\n  \n  <p>If the woman was unmarried, let the man marry\n  her? His mind would not have been eased by\n  marriage. <strong>As Rabbi\n  Yitzchak says:</strong> Since the day the Temple was destroyed, sexual pleasure\n  was taken away from those who engage in permitted intercourse and\n  given to transgressors, as it is stated: “Stolen waters are sweet, and\n  bread eaten in secret is pleasant” (Proverbs 9:17). Therefore, the man\n  could have been cured only by engaging in illicit sexual interaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbi Yitzchak is not even commenting on the incident</strong> under discussion. He is not talking about a case of illness. The Talmud is just using a statement he once made about human nature to partially support the diagnosis made at the time of this incident. The identity of the person who made this diagnosis is not revealed; it may have been the doctor. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Yitzchak was not part of the decision there. Obviously the Rabbis involved in the decision would have had to consider the possibility of marriage if it was relevant, and assuming it was relevant they decided it would not have helped.</p>\n\n<p>The gemera reports the story, and asks why marriage would not have been a solution. Rav Yitzchak explains that the need for specifically illicit relations could have created this situation where marriage would not have helped him. </p>\n\n\n",

This was touched upon in another post but I still do not understand.</p>\n\n<p>How can G-D not know that you're going to make a certain act? Maybe He didn't \"predict\" you to do such a thing but He still knew you were going to do said thing. <strong>So:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> How can G-D'S Knowledge be limited by our free will and</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> How can G-D not \"predict\" what you're going to do if the future is standing before G-D then He must surely know what you did and this means He would have predicted this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In philosophy, there are two classes of models about time. In A-Theory, time is primarily about tenses and the flow of time. Past-Present-Future are definitional. This certainly corresponds to how we experience time.</p>\n\n<p>However, in Relativity, Spacetime is one thing. Time is just one out of four dimensions. For that matter, people moving relative to each other don't have exactly the same time axis. (This is why events get further apart, but spatially closer together in the direction of travel.) The equations of physics, even before Einstein, work equally well in either direction. This is a b-theory of time, where the flow of time is an experience we impose on something that is fundamentally one solid thing. (Perhaps related to how the accumulation of experience involves the growth of entropy.) B-theory is often referred to as \"block time\". The universe as a 4D sculpture.</p>\n\n<p>Now what does this have to do about the Ralbag and Omniscience?</p>\n\n<p>In b-theory, there is a truth value to \"John will buy a car tomorrow\". What we don't have today is knowledge -- we don't know whether he will or he won't. But one of those two is true right now, already.</p>\n\n<p>In a-theory, there isn't. It's simply not a fact yet. We don't just not know, it isn't part of reality.</p>\n\n<p>The Ralbag's theory of time is an a-theory.</p>\n\n<p>There are less discussed, theories c-theories of time (sometimes labeled \"c-theories\") that would fit the Ralbag's words. Such as if he believed in a growing block time -- the past and present are real and true, but not the future. But in any case, the Ralbag does not have a b-theory, his is not a block time in which all points on the timeline are equally real.</p>\n\n<p>The Ralbag believes that Hashem knows everything. But claims about the future don't exist -- they aren't part of \"everything\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(That said, I have my own problems with the Ralbag's definition of Omniscience.  It places Hashem within time by assuming He Knows something after my decision that He didn't know before. But G-d is למעלה מן הזמן - \"above\" time; the Creator of time rather than one of us who live within it. Which in itself answers the paradox of Omniscience and free will. G-d doesn't Know now what I will decide tomorrow. But not because He doesn't Know, but because He doesn't do it now, or at any other point <strong>in</strong> time.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Many people like to accept the belief that G-d knows everything, but there are Jews, wise Jews, who disagree. For example, ibn Ezra felt that G-d knows the generalities – the laws of nature – but not the details (people as individuals). Ralbag, as you wrote, also held this view. In fact, Gersonides held many unconventional opinions, such as Divine knowledge. For example, Gersonides was convinced that G-d doesn’t know people as individuals, meaning that He does not know how people will act but only the general rules of the laws of nature, how people could act, or what might possibly occur, since people can become subvert to the laws of nature. Thus, according to Ralbag, the idea that G-d is all-knowing may not be true. He seems to say that G-d does not know humans.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was the blasphemer not allowed to dwell among Dan?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.24.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 24:10</a> it says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"There came out among the Israelites one whose mother was Israelite and whose father was Egyptian. And a fight broke out in the camp between that half-Israelite and a certain Israelite.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And on this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.24.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Leviticus.24.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"A Baraitha states that ויצא means, he came out of the judicial court of Moses where he had been pronounced to be in the wrong in the following matter: although his father was an Egyptian he had gone to pitch his tent in the camp of the tribe of Dan to whom his mother belonged (cf. v. 11). They (the men of Dan) said to him, “What have you to do here\" (lit., what is your character that gives you the right to come here?). He replied. “I am one of the children of the tribe of Dan”. Thereupon they said to him, “Scripture states: (Numbers 2:2) “Every man [of the children of Israel shall encamp] by his own standard, that bears the signs of their father’s house”! He thereupon went in to the judicial court of Moses to have the matter decided and came forth (יצא) declared to be in the wrong. He then stood up and blasphemed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.24.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Mizrachi%2C_Leviticus.24.10.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Mizrachi explains</a> that each tribe decided to dwell separately so it would be possible to tell who was of which tribe and who wasn't of any tribe.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly, the reason the blasphemer was not allowed to dwell with Dan, the tribe of his mother, was because tribal heritage goes according to the father and his father was an Egyptian man. However, in Divrei Hayamim 1 2:22-23 it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Afterward Hezron had relations with the daughter of Machir father of Gilead—he had married her when he was sixty years old—and she bore him Segub; and Segub begot Jair; he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Yair is the one known as \"Yair ben Menashe\" who captured the cities known as \"Chavot Yair\", according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.22?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_I_Chronicles.2.22.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.22?lang=bi&p2=Tur_HaAroch%2C_Numbers.32.41.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Ha'aroch</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why was Yair, whose father was from the Tribe of Yehudah and grandmother from Menashe allowed to lived among the Tribe of Menashe, but the blasphemer wasn't allowed to live among the Tribe of Dan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The blasphemer was no a member of <strong>any</strong> tribe and the tribes were required to camp in their tribal areas in the desert. The situation in the land was different. Had his father been an Israelite, he would have been required to camp with his father's tribe. Since he was not a member of any tribe, he would have been required to camp with the erev rav.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that the halacha in the midbar and the first generation in the in the land was that a woman who inherited land from her father was not allowed to marry a man from a different tribe. Consider the halacha after the Bnos Tzelaphchad when the elders of Menashe asked for a ruling after they were allowed to inherit their father's property. The pasuk from Divrei Hayamim occurred after the ruling had expired. As Radak explains the wife of Yair inherited these 23 cities from her father and he inherited them from her.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.2.22?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_I_Chronicles.2.22.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak on I Divrei Hayamim 2:22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורבותינו ז\"ל אמרו כי אין זה יאיר הכתוב בתורה אלא זה יאיר בן שגוב לקח\n  אשה בארץ הגלעד ומתה וירשה ומירושת אשתו היו לו אלו עשרים ושלשה ערים: </p>\n  \n  <p>Our rabbis OB'M explained that this is not the Yair written in the\n  torah but Yair ben Shaguv who married a woman from the land of Gilead\n  and she died and she had inherited and from the inheritance of his\n  wife were these twenty three cities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.2.22?lang=bi&p2=Tur_HaAroch%2C_Numbers.32.41.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Ha'aroch</a> explains that he took on the name of the most prestigious ancestor who was the daughter of Menashe. It was not that he was a member of the tribe but that it was a way of showing a noble ancestry.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאיר בן מנשה. כתב הרמב\"ן האיש הזה מתייחס אל משפחת אמו בעבור שלקח\n  אחוזתו עמהם כי בדברי הימים מפורש שהוא בן חצרון בן קרח ואמו בת מכיר בן\n  מנשה דכתיב ואחר בא חצרון אל בת מכיר אבי גלעד ותלד לו את שגוב ושגוב\n  הוליד את יאיר ויהי לו עשרים ושלש ערים בארץ הגלעד:</p>\n  \n  <p>ויאיר בן מנשה, “and Yair, son of Menashe, etc.” Nachmanides writes\n  that this man traced himself to the family tree of his mother, seeing\n  that he had taken possession of his ancestral land with that family.\n  In Chronicles I 2,21 it is stated specifically that paternally he was\n  the son of Chetzron, who in turn was a son of Peretz, son of Yehudah.\n  [My version of the Tur, has this as Chetzron, son of Korach, clearly\n  an error. Ed.] His mother was a daughter of Machir son of Menashe, as\n  we have a verse stating: ואחר בא חצרון אל בת מכיר אבי גלעד ותלד לו את\n  שגוב, ושגוב הוליד את יאיר ויהי לו עשרים ושלוש ערים בארץ גלעד, “after\n  that Chetzron slept with (or married) a daughter of Machir, the father\n  of Gilead. She bore for him Seguv, and Seguv fathered Yair, who had\n  twenty three cities in the land of Gilead.” (Chronicles I 2,22)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16522/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains that after the ruling expired and Yair was such an important person, the the sons of Machir gave the cities as a dowry to Yair.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>And afterwards Hezron came to the daughter of Machir:</strong> This was because of David’s honor, because Hezron came to the daughter of\n  Machir, taking her as a concubine, not for matrimony, similar to (Ps.\n  51: 2): “… when he came to Bathsheba,” and he was sixty years old,\n  thus making two uncomplimentary qualities for Machir’s daughter: one,\n  that he did not take her for the purpose of matrimony, and one, that\n  he was old, but because of the esteem of the families of Judah, they\n  gave her to him, and when Jair begot [children], Machir’s sons gave\n  him twenty-three cities to take one of his daughters as a wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication is that the sons of Machir knew that they would not be able to adequately defend the cities as we see in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16522/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 23</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כג וַיִּקַּ֣ח גְּשֽׁוּר־וַֽ֠אֲרָם אֶת־חַוֹּ֨ת יָאִ֧יר מֵֽאִתָּ֛ם\n  אֶת־קְנָ֥ת וְאֶת־בְּנוֹתֶ֖יהָ שִׁשִּׁ֣ים עִ֑יר כָּל־אֵ֕לֶּה בְּנֵ֖י\n  מָכִ֥יר אֲבִֽי־גִלְעָֽד:</p>\n  \n  <p>23 And Geshur and Aram took the villages of Jair from them; with\n  Kenath and its villages, sixty cities; all these [belonged to] the\n  sons of Machir, the father of Gilead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The blasphemer was part Egyptian but his parentage seems not to be the issue. The Bible says that this man, the blasphemer “went out,” left his dwelling (Rabbi S.R. Hirsch) and fought with an Israelites, who could have been Zelophehad (Tosafot, Bava Batra 119). During or after this fight was when the man committed blasphemy.</p>\n\n<p>The midrashic Aramaic translation Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, identifies that the transgressor was “a sinful man, a rebel against the G-d of heaven, who came out of Egypt.” He was “the son of the Egyptian who killed an Israelite in Egypt and had relations with this man’s wife, who conceived and bore a son.” This son wished to pitch his tent with the tribe of Dan, but the tribe of Dan refused him. He then took representatives from Dan to the Israelite court. When the court denied him, he “blasphemed the great and glorious name, and pronounced explicitly (the one) he had heard on Sinai, and deliberately provoked G-d.” It is possible that he [the blasphemer] uttered the Tetragrammaton (Pseudo-Jonathan Sifra, Rashi, and Maimonides). </p>\n\n<p>There is the possibility that he changed or bored off the point in daled in the word echad the Shema's dalet to a reish, from “the L-rd our G-d is One,” to “the L-rd our G-d is other,” thus he changed the shema yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai echad, \"Hear, O Israel, the L-rd our G-d, the L-rd is one,\" echad to acher, \"other,\" thus denying the oneness and uniqueness of G-d. This is in violation of G-d's unity. Some rabbi attributes this view to the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 56a, and the Zohar but it is more likely, as pointed out in one of the comments, that this source came from Tzror Hamor, which you can read <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=30801#p=223&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But there are other possibilities for why the blasphemer was denied to reside within the tribe of Dan. Since the days of Jacob, it was customary for the first-born to inherit the tribe of their fathers. Thus the blasphemer parentage seems to be an issue. However, after the golden calf incident, the Levites took the priestly duties away from Aaron's sons. Thus the Torah does away with the first-born privilege. But at the end of the day, anything we might think or say is speculation. We simply do not know and may never know. We can only speculate. True, like this story there are many terms, words, or phrases found in the Torah that are obscure. But this makes the Bible more interactive and helps encourage interpretation.</p>\n\n\n",

Thank you for sharing your insightful question - The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.2.3?vhe=Sefer_Yetzirah,_Warsaw_1884&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yetzira (2:3)</a> is one of the earliest sources which discusses the connection between each group of letters which are interchangeable and explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עשרים ושתים אותיות יסוד חקוקות בקול חצובות ברוח קבועות בפה בחמשה\nמקומות אחה\"ע בומ\"ף גיכ\"ק דטלנ\"ת זסשר\"ץ [קשורות בלשון כשהלבת בגחלת\nאחה\"ע משמשת בסוף הלשון ובבית הבליעה בומ\"ף בין השפתים ובראש הלשון גיכ\"ק\nעל שלישיתה של לשון נכרתת דטלנ\"ת בראש הלשון משמשת עם הקול וסצר\"ש בין\nהשינים ולשון שכובה ושטותה] - Twenty-two letters are formed by the\nvoice, impressed on the air, and audibly uttered in five situations:\nin the throat as guttural sounds; in the palate as palatals; by the\ntongue as linguals; through the teeth as dentals; and by the lips as\nlabial sounds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the letters in תְּכֵלֶת and שחֵלֶת certainly sound similar, when connecting words it's important to note which letters are interchangeable. In this case, although ת and ש are not technically interchangeable in Hebrew, Rav Hirsch would occasionally use those two letters interchangeably when connecting them to Aramaic terms in the Gemara where ת and ש are interrelated. Perhaps the more significant reason why it may be difficult to connect these two words is the difference between כ and ח. Though they do sound somewhat similar, the Sefer Yetzira groups them differently. Consequently, I don't recall Rav Hirsch connecting those two letters too much (if at all).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why do we seem to force different shittos into a single approach",
    "content": "# Why do we seem to force different shittos into a single approach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This seems to take different forms:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reconciling</strong> - One of the beauties (in terms of enjoyment) of learning is trying to reconcile sugyas or shittos that appear to be contradictory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Patch work</strong> - Likewise, we create a patch work of different works/seforim taking ideas from each and combine together, and the resultant composite , mixed or blended shittah that emerges essentially is a new shittah, with little resemblance to the individual components (just not contradicting anything that was stated explicitly)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compiling</strong> - similarly (very common in halachah) if one sefer mentions a particular practice, and another sefer mentions a different way - a current sefer will list both as requirements, essentially compiling together anything found.  It's not viewed as Rabbi \"A\" did \"a\" but intentionally not \"b\", and Rabbi \"B\" the opposite - i.e. they disagreed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cover all bases</strong> - if it was merely that we said - hey I'm not sure, so let's \"compile\" all of the different practices that we've seen/read into our daily practice - just to be safe.  i.e. allow that they  are not all needed (in regards to halachah) and may even disagree with each other (and are not all needed) - but we're not sure - so we play it safe.  Or likewise go l'chumra and take the largest/smallest to be safe.  Like so many things we do in situations of doubt. \n This would be intuitive, without the need for the \"unless <strong>explicitly</strong> stated otherwise - assume and maintain a single opinion\"</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What would be wrong this is the case?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>too much evidence to the contrary -</em> This would seem to be in opposition to the Mishnayos, where (it seems that )virtually every Mishnah has a machlokes - where Rav A views the matter one way and Rav B a different way.\nThe \"2 Jews - 3 Shuls\" joke\nIf someone asks you a question on any matter, you can answer \"It's a מחלוקת\" without knowing anything about the topic, and probably be correct.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Can stray from the truth</em> - If this assumption (all agree) is incorrect - creating blended or compiled shittos - is taking us away from the truth, more so coming up with במה דברים אמורים scenarios, to limit one or more of the shittos to only specific situations could again be changing their original intention - i.e. going further from the truth.  Away from listening to what the author is actually saying and what their words seem to imply (without any preconceived notions) and see where those words bring you too (and only then compare to others to determine if different, and then revisit - how מוכרח strongly implied is this משמעות) </p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did I get this impression from?</strong>\nIt's especially frustrating, when learning a hashkafa sefer with someone, and as you're learning Rav A's opinion, the chevrusa is inserting into Rav A's words what he (the chevrusa) learned from reading Rav B, C & D (and even if where the משמעות is to the contrary - it'll be forced in).  So in the end, you never (or rarely) learn everything new as it's a rehash of what you already know (from Rav B, C & D) because they're not \"listening\" to what Rav A has to say.</p>\n\n<p>I would attribute this to a flaw in the chevrusa, but I've had too MANY like this to be just a bad apple.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it's a flaw in the current chinuch?  However, you find this in the Gemara itself - where it may resolve an apparent contradiction by saying במה דברים אמורים - and limit the opinion of one to be speaking of only in an obscure scenario and very rare case  - DESPITE not saying a word that seems to hint to that specific case, not to mention that it would seem to be a VERY important detail to leave out.<br>\nSimilarly, you find the common approach to reconcile different (seemingly contradictory) opinions is to embrace one (which becomes the ikkur) and relegate the other to a specific situation (unlikely to occur) or of little importance.  In essence selecting one over the other, without having to acknowledge that there was even a debate and in turn no \"selecting\" done by us.  (I'm not knowledgeable to know whether this approach itself is only limited to certain types of situations (it would be great if it were limited to only different statements from the same source, but I am not knowledgeable enough to know if that is true, or something similar.  Also we do find in other cases the Gemara state various opinions and leave it at that without reconciling.\nLikewise, Tos will bring different sugyas together - which again makes it VERY enjoyable as it opens up the sugya - think how dull it would be if the answer would also be \"they argue\" - this would greatly simplify the complexity that emerges from Tos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why not embrace it?</strong> - To be clear, I'm not asking regarding \"normative\" halachah - as I know there is a process in order to determine what is the way to practice.<br>\nאדרבה, What I'm asking is that the system allows for different opinions, and has a process to decide למעשה how to act.  If it (having different opinions) is allowed.  And we see - VERY prevalent, then why the desire to force seemingly disparate opinions into one homogeneous opinion.\nPeople ask - why is the Jewish view on ...?  What's wrong with \"there's different opinions on the matter\"?  Again, outside of halachah, where the different opinions, must \"collapse\" into a single psak (from the בית דין הגדול בלשכת הגזית).\nWhy not embrace the world of possibility, and that they Torah includes in it the possibility for all of these opinions (and was even intentionally worded as such to allow for all of the various views) אלו ואלו דברי אלוקים חיים - \nI recall even hearing of a Zohar that even at har Sinai - each person had a different understanding of what was revealed.  (I think I also saw this in Rav Dessler,מכתב מאליהו  - if anyone knows the place - please let me know)</p>\n\n<p>Thus when asked what is the Jewish view on it - why can't the response be - \"actually, why don't you tell me what it is.  Go and connect to the source, and tell me what you see.  All that I can do is tell you what I see, and what others have seen (which at best will give you a consensus (but again not asking for normative halachah)))\"\nSo we'll have what (acc to that Zohar) we had at ha Sinai - each of us has different revelation from the Torah, and we converge in practice with a single halachah as decided by the Beis Din haGadol\nIs this crazy?  Am I way off?  It seems so intuitive to me, and self evident.  However, as I pointed out contradicted by the crazy (reconciling) limiting cases of the Gemara</p>\n\n\n",

Is \"Israel\" also a name of Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The English translation of your quotation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיִכָּֽנְע֨וּ עַמִּ֜י אֲשֶׁ֧ר נִֽקְרָא־שְׁמִ֣י עֲלֵיהֶ֗ם וְיִֽתְפַּֽלְלוּ֙ וִֽיבַקְשׁ֣וּ פָנַ֔י</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>would be better understood as, <em>I will humble My people who (have the teaching of) calling My name by them. And they will pray and they will seek My face...etc.</em></p>\n\n<p>This means that for prayers to be efficacious and answered quickly and in the best possible way, proper form and intention matters. This idea is expressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Abraham_Gikatilla\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla</a> in his introduction to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Orah%2C_Introduction?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Shaarei Orah</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>You asked me</strong>, brother, dear friend, <strong>to clarify in front of you a path about the names of the Holy One, Blessed be He, the Exalted and Almighty</strong>, to produce with them according your will and to reach through them the object of your desire. And by seeing that your intention is honest, and better than (simply fulfilling) your request, I must let you know which way will spread light (be spiritually profitable); <strong>namely, what is the way that HaShem Almighty desires or does not desire.</strong> And when you get to know this, <strong>then call HaShem and He will respond.</strong> And you will be closest to him. And love Him with all your soul, and rejoice on HaShem. <strong>And He will grant you the requests of your heart.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, the Hebrew word 'שמי' used in the expression from your quotation is understood as a Roshei Teivot for the names which form part of the inner intention (kavannah). It stands for the names of the 3 angels which are to be intended during traditional Jewish prayer.</p>\n\n<p>The names of these three angels are Shmu-i-el (שמועיאל), Metatron (מטטרון) and Yehav-i-el (יהואל). These angels also correspond with the actual chain of prophetic transmission to the Jewish people, namely Shmuel HaNavi, Moshe Rabbeinu and Eliyahu HaNavi.</p>\n\n<p>This is a tradition which has been passed down through the Prophets to the present day and which has its origins all the way back to Adam HaRishon.</p>\n\n<p>For a detailed record of the chain of transmission and the mention of these three angelic names specifically, see this link to the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44425&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to Sefer Brit Menucha</a> which is one of the authoritative sources discussing this subject.<em>(see also additional details on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berit_Menuchah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Brit Menucha</a> and its author <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/abraham-ben-isaac-granada\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Avraham ben Yitzchok of Granada/Rimon</a>)</em></p>\n\n<p>This same teaching is echoed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.41.25?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah the Prophet in 41:25</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have roused him from the north, and he has come, From the sunrise, one who invokes <strong>My name</strong>; And he has trampled rulers like mud, Like a potter treading clay.</p>\n  \n  <p>הַעִיר֤וֹתִי מִצָּפוֹן֙ וַיַּ֔את מִמִּזְרַח־שֶׁ֖מֶשׁ <strong>יִקְרָ֣א בִשְׁמִ֑י</strong> וְיָבֹ֤א סְגָנִים֙ כְּמוֹ־חֹ֔מֶר וּכְמ֥וֹ יוֹצֵ֖ר יִרְמָס־טִֽיט׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And again in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.43.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 43:7</a> which repeats the concept:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כֹּ֚ל הַנִּקְרָ֣א בִשְׁמִ֔י</strong> וְלִכְבוֹדִ֖י בְּרָאתִ֑יו יְצַרְתִּ֖יו אַף־עֲשִׂיתִֽיו׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.13.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariah the Prophet 13:9</a> who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That third I will put into the fire, And I will smelt them as one smelts silver And test them as one tests gold. <strong>He will call in My name</strong>, And I will respond to him. I will declare, “You are My people,” And he will declare, “The L-RD is my G-d!”</p>\n  \n  <p>וְהֵבֵאתִ֤י אֶת־הַשְּׁלִשִׁית֙ בָּאֵ֔שׁ וּצְרַפְתִּים֙ כִּצְרֹ֣ף אֶת־הַכֶּ֔סֶף וּבְחַנְתִּ֖ים כִּבְחֹ֣ן אֶת־הַזָּהָ֑ב <strong>ה֣וּא ׀</strong> <strong>יִקְרָ֣א בִשְׁמִ֗י וַֽאֲנִי֙ אֶעֱנֶ֣ה אֹת֔וֹ</strong> אָמַ֙רְתִּי֙ עַמִּ֣י ה֔וּא וְה֥וּא יֹאמַ֖ר יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהָֽי׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This third example from Zechariah is the most clear reference to the concept that it applies to prayer.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is also expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.49.1?vhe=Sifrei_Devarim,_Hebrew&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei to Devarim 49:1</a>. G-d wants us to pray with proper intention which includes intending the system by which He has created the entire universe <em>(meaning also intending the appropriate angelic names)</em>. But at the same time, it must be constantly remembered what is also expressed in the Sifrei just preceding this, namely <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.48.12?vhe=Sifrei_Devarim,_Hebrew&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">by Hillel at the end of 48:12</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And thus does Hillel say: \"One who makes use of the 'Crown' (for his own purposes) passes away\" (from the world.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is referring to someone who tries to appeal exclusively to the angelic influences, something called <em>binding names.</em> Even though we are taught to have these intentions, we know we only pray to G-d. These intentions are simply proper form and etiquette.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your last question, the name, Israel, has an element that alludes to a similar structure to that of angels. But like is taught in the Zohar, Israel transcends the concept of angels. This is expressed through the statement that Israel, the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He are all one.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<h2>Yehuda/יהודה</h2>\n<p>We are called \"Yehuda/Yehudim\" as our eternal name and it contains the [4 letters of the] sheim Hashem in it.</p>\n<p>The Sfas Emes explains that it's G-d's name with an added letter Daled (ד) that represents our poor state in exile.

So he advises that you first start by leaving one forkful of food from your plate at the end of every meal. Upon mastering this you move on to another forkful from another one of the elements on the plate e.g. you leave a forkful of meat and potato etc. once being able to do this you then move on to refraining from the 'best bit' of the food e.g. your most favourite part like the gooey cheese on a pizza. </p>\n\n\n",

In a footnote he remarks that this should apply to onion powder and garlic powder as well.</p>\n\n<p>(By cooking it's even worse, since even dry spices which don't taste so sharp gain their sharpness when they are soaked in a dish. So it could be that even the mekilim would be stringent in a case of cooking if the flavor is very strong. Admittedly by cooking it's rare to use so much that the food is extremely spicy.) </p>\n\n<p>See also the following <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-96/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Q&A</a>, which also explicitly posits like Ohel Yaakov:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Q] What is the law of onion powder and garlic powder?</p>\n  \n  <p>[A]Onion and garlic powder fall under the dispute of dry Charif foods\n  regarding whether they are considered sharp. Practically, the final\n  ruling follows that they are considered sharp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Afterwards I located a sefer called \"Davar Charif\" which is devoted entirely to the topic of these halachos. <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/pages/?&restore=1&t=1589137579581&pagenum=87&book=600104\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter three halacha 1 with footnote 17</a> discusses the halachos of cooked dishes. While he doesn't mention onion powder or garlic powder explicitly, he does assume that if the entire food tastes extremely spicy (because of added spices, like seasoning to chili) then we give the food the status of being called \"davar charif.\" As far as I can tell, he does not distinguish anywhere between different types of seasonings which cause the spiciness; it's only a question of how spicy (extremely spicy versus mild etc.) </p>\n\n<p>This would seem to differ with the above sources, whereby it's not about if specific ingredients have a status of spicy or not. If you would add so much garlic and onion powder or any spice such that the food became extremely spicy then the food would be a davar charif. It all depends on the level of spiciness.</p>\n\n\n",

Midrash Shmuel writes in the name of Rashbatz that the mishna should read “do not comfort him while he is in mourning,” and that the versions that read “while the body lies before him” are the result of a deliberate alteration of the text to account for fact that after burial, people would make rows and comfort the mourner, as is mentioned in Avel Rabbasi and in the Talmud in Berachos 16b. He says that there is no reason to change the text, however, because it doesn’t say “during his days of mourning” or “during his mourning process.” The text says “while he is mourning,” i.e. while he is in mournful grief. [<strong>I still feel that this is difficult to reconcile with the practice of making rows. According to this, if the bereaved is indeed in a state of mournful grief they shouldn’t comfort him, and we do not find the Sages making this distinction.</strong>]</em>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed if one looks at the <strong>Lechem Shamayim</strong>'s commentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.18?lang=bi&with=Lechem%20Shamayim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> it implies that sometimes it is better not console them until after the shiva or shloshim.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, we generally make a point of doing the Levayo at the earliest opportunity at which point the shiva begins soon after. At almost the first opportunity the ovel is confronted by a constant stream of consolation and people seeking to comfort them.</p>\n\n<p>Every mourner is in a state of intense grief, and yet in my experience we give constant consolation shiva and shloshim? How can we ever know if someone is more in pain than any other mourner and resultantly shouldn't hear consolation?</p>\n\n<p>Sources for answers are preferred please.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Lechem shamayim that you quote seemingly answers your question.\nHis discussion is about who should initiate the nechama during the shiva.\ni.e. when a person goes to be Menachem avel, should he start speaking or should he wait for the avel to start?</p>\n\n<p>He says that during the shiva we should wait for the avel to indicate that he wants to start talking. Sometimes it could even be only after the shiva that a visitor should initiate divrei nichumim.</p>\n\n<p>In this sense this fits with the general custom of waiting for the avel to start talking before we make comments (unless it's clear from the circumstance that the avel wants us to start talking to him.) </p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are people who don't know better and start talking before the avel; there are even some people who think it's beneficial to distract the avel and talk about other things.

    "content": "# Menachot 65/66 why did the counting of the omer needed to start with a fixed time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was looking at all the arguments made (against the Boethians) in favor of counting the omer from 16th Nisan until Shavuot - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Menachot.65b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 65/66</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then I went looking at Leviticus 23 and Deuteronomy 16.</p>\n\n<p>In Deuteronomium 16:9 it says to begin to number from the time the sickle is first put to the standing crop. But no day, time or date is given.</p>\n\n<p>So Leviticus 23 needs to help to determine when we need to start to count. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It says we need to bring the omer of the first fruits of the harvest and wave it: \n  ממחרת השבת\n  And ביום we wave it we need to offer... and we shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until היום הזה.\n  And we shall count unto us from: ממחרת השבת. That is: מיום that we brought the sheaf of the waving; its duration: שבע שבתות תמימת תהיינה.</p>\n  \n  <p>עד ממחרת השבת השביעת we count חמשים יום.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The start and duration are clear, but how was it determined that the words ממחרת השבת had to be referring to the Pesach week?\nWhy did ‘the time the sickle was first put to the standing crop’ needed to be a fixed time? As a farmer, we normally look at our harvest to see when the time is right to put a sickle to it.\nSo why (please forgive me for my horrible Hebrew grammar) couldn’t it refer to the ממחרת השבת של הניף את העמר? - the morrow after the שבת, which is היום, one waves the omer. I.e. at the moment these actions take place you need to start to count. In such a case the court could determine each year when one had to harvest and when one needed to wave and start the count. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The rabbis held that the words ממחרת השבת (\"the day after the Shabbat\") referred to the day after the holiday, not the day after Saturday. The proof for this is (as given by Rabbi Yosi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Menachot.66a.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 66a</a>) is that if Shabbat refers to Saturday, you don't know which Saturday in the year it is. As I understand it, the question on this is essentially: why do we care if we don't know which Saturday in the year it is, if every individual can bring it on the day after Saturday on which he harvests?</p>\n\n<p>Here are two possible ways to derive from the Torah that the count must be the same for everyone, and not different for each farmer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We learn from תספר לך (singular) in Deuteronomy that the counting is done by a court, and from וספרתם לכם (plural) in Leviticus that the counting is done by every individual (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Menachot.65b.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 65b-66a</a>). Presumably, the individual count and the communal count should coincide.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the count were individual, then every individual would have to give the same sacrifice at the beginning and end of the count. It seems that the rabbis took it as obvious that this was not the case, because they used this fact to derive that Leviticus 2:14, which also speaks of this offering, is communal and not individual (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifra%2C_Emor%2C_Chapter_13.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Kohanim</a> on this verse). Maybe this is a דבר הלמד מעניינו (something learned from context), since the many animal sacrifices that accompany the bread offered at the end of the count (Leviticus 23:18-19) are far beyond any obligatory individual sacrifice, but in line with the holiday communal sacrifices.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Also, it's worth nothing that the Boethusians apparently also agreed that Shavu'ot had to be on the same date for everyone, since they once tried to fool the sages into making Shavu'ot fall on a Sunday, in accordance with their method (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Rosh_HaShanah.1.14?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Rosh Hashana 1:14</a>, Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.22b.7?lang=he&with=Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 22b</a>). If the day were determined by the individual who was counting, there would be no need to force the sages to celebrate on the same day. So it seems that it was agreed unanimously that the counting had to be the same for everyone, but the question was only which day to start.</p>\n\n\n",

(While the book aims for an ecumenical pastoral voice, the footnotes always mention Orthodox halacha.) The halachos of shiva still apply, but it doesn't need to be observed the common way. They suggest that the mourner mentally frame it as \"grieving for the relationship they wish they could have had\", and note that there's absolutely no need for open hours for visitors to come talk about what a wonderful person the departed was (or for the clueless to ask painful questions). The mourner could do the whole thing privately -- but the fact that the relationship was strained doesn't allow them to do things that are normally prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>This is consistent with what I saw when a friend of mine lost a parent with whom the relationship wasn't close.

    "content": "# Why do we try to reconcile machlokes\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There seems to be an implied \"rule\" (or at least strong desire) in Torah (derech halimud) to limit machklokes wherever possible and moreso what seems \"at all costs\"</p>\n\n<p>My question is simply - Why?</p>\n\n<p>Here's more detail/background on the question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can understand in cases where there are 2 seemingly contradictory statements from one author (for example 2 Rambam's Mishneh Torah vs. Moreh Nevuchim) - that although it's possible that he changed his mind over time (and thus the latter reflects his true opinion) - this would not be very common, thus fair to assume that there in fact is no contradiction.  </li>\n<li>Or likewise 2 separate (seemingly) contradictory statements from the same author in the same sefer - which would have all the more reason to assume that they in fact do reconcile./don't contradict</li>\n<li>Likewise, I'm not referring to the mesorah that we received at Sinai, as then it would be understood as unlikely to have 2 contradictory statements from one author (Hashem)</li>\n<li>Regarding the Written Torah itself (i.e. single sefer (Torah) from single author (Hashem)) - you get involved in the idea of אלו ואלו דברי אלוקים חיים - that allows for contradictory statements from Him (i.e. single author) - so I'm not referring to that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So basically, since it seems to be self evident that 2 people (especially Jews) can have 2 different opinions on the same matter - why try to reconcile (even to the extent of what seems as very forced answers).  Why not \"embrace\" the different opinions (again where it doesn't imply a break in the chain of mesorah) and especially after than chain was broken (Beis Shammai - Beis Hillel).</p>\n\n<p>On a personal basis, it frustrates me learning with people, who when faced with different seforim (Rishonim, Acharonim) that seem to be saying different opinions, will try to force them into one (so long as it's not explicitely stated otherwise)</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious to know where the source of this \"bias\"/assumption is ?  </p>\n\n<p>I looked in the sefer Halichos Olam, and in Shaar Sheini - 50 he gives an example from Bava Metzia  (10b) \nואמר ריש לקיש משום אבא כהן ברדלא: קטנה אין לה חצר, ואין לה ארבע אמות. ורבי יוחנן משום רבי ינאי אמר: יש לה חצר ויש לה ארבע אמות \nThis would seem to be a pretty obvious and explicit case where these Amoraim argue.  The Halichos Olam says \n\"אע\"ג דמשמע דפליגי קאמר התם דחד מיירי בגיטין וחד מיירי במציאה ולא פליגי כלומר מר מודה ליה בגיטין ומה (מר?) מודה ליה במציאה, וכי האי גוונא איכא טובא \"\nAlthough the Gemara, presents versions that they do in fact argue (albeit agreeing in one case).  Nevertheless, this seems to be the final אי בעית אימא conclusion of the Gemara that there is no argument at all, and each statement was not said סתם but rather in a specific context.</p>\n\n<p>This \"reconciliation\" is made even though </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>both halachos are quoted in absolute terms (without any reference or hint to being limited specifically to cases of acquiring a get or lost object) - thus it would seem that these statements/rulings were taken (and passed on) out of context.</li>\n<li>making this reconciliation is not a stringency to cover all basis, as by stating that Reish Lakish (who said that אין לה חצר) is referring specifically to a lost object (see Rashi) but in regards to get would agree to Rebbi Yochanan that יש לה חצר - we're considering her divorced and permitted to other men.  Whereas the simple understanding of Reish Lakish, is that in all cases חצר does not acquire for her, and as such the get was never given to her, and she is not permitted to other men.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Halichos Olam, concludes, that not only is this a common occurrence (as quoted above) but moreso this is the <strong><em>preferred</em></strong> approach</p>\n\n<p>וכל היכא דאשפר לומר כן ושלא לעשות פלוגתא בין החכמים שפיר דמי</p>\n\n<p>So at least as far back as 1490 (date of publication of the sefer) this is the preferred approach.  And of course much further back, as he brought only one example from the Gemara, as he says there is many more.  Anyone who learns Gemara, has even come across the lengths that the Gemara will go to try to find some reconciliation, even if it essentially relegates one of the opinions to referring specifically to a very far fetched/ i.e. limited case which rarely ever occurs.</p>\n\n<p>So back to the question, WHY?  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if it seems abundantly clear that different people have different ways of looking that things</li>\n<li>and we see tons of cases where (there is no choice but to accept) that there is debate.  </li>\n<li>And we (the Gemara) even received the mesorah from the Tannaim (via the Mishnayos) that continually states machlokes.  </li>\n<li>And we (the Gemara) has admitted that now we live in a time of ריבוי מחלוקת (Sanhedrin 88b, Sotah 47b)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If so, when we encounter a case which is CLEARLY stated as 2 separate opinions - Why try to \"force\" the issue and create cases that aren't stated and qualify statements which were given (over) in absolute terms?  </p>\n\n<p>It's not like doing so will restore a situation of a single homogeneous state where there is a single view/shittah on everything.  </p>\n\n<p>More so, doing so could have a steep cost - as wouldn't these qualifications that are introduced be distorting the true intention, literally inserting something that the author never said?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are two parts to this answer, one historical and one in \"what's more likely?\"</p>\n<p>The historical aspect is that our tradition is that Moshe Rabbeinu received the complete Torah from Hashem. So the question that needs to be asked is, \"How do machloksim start in the first place, if Moshe received everything directly?\" Now this is a topic that can take an entire book to resolve (See the Dynamics of Dispute by Zvi Lampel), but basically it means the tradition had a breakdown somewhere. But it makes sense to assume that the breakdown was smaller rather than larger.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is the general rule, תפסת מיעוט תפסת תפסת מרובה לא תפסת. In other words, always start with the smallest assumption possible that covers the facts. Sort of like Occam's razor. So why assume a large breakdown in the tradition if a small one can explain the different views?</p>\n<p>In regards to the example you brought from Halichos Olam:</p>\n<p>Imagine an alien who never visited Earth has two statements in front of him:\nTom says the sky is light blue. Harry says the sky is dark, almost black, with little points of light scattered across it. To the alien, these statements might seem contradictory. But to us these statements are obviously not contradictory: Tom is describing the sky during the day, and Harry is describing it at night. \"But nobody said anything about day or night!\" the alien might protest. \"Because it was obvious,\" we would answer.</p>\n<p>Similarly, to us the statements of Reish Lakish and R' Yochanan seem contradictory, but to the writers of the Gemara, they were clearly different cases.</p>\n<p>Now let's say the two statements are not obviously referring to different cases, and the Gemara doesn't address the apparent contradiction. Should we assume that 1) there is an argument unaddressed in the Gemara (even though the Gemara usually explains when a statement is disputed) or 2) that there is a way to reconcile the two statements as being about different cases, and perhaps the resolution was obvious enough to the Gemara that it did not need to say it explicitly. When you factor in that the entire Torah was given to Moshe Rabbeinu and everyone starts from the same place, it is very reasonable to look for some factor that can explain the two statements without them contradicting. If you find one, great. If not, maybe you do have an argument on your hands. A lot of the discussion of the commentaries from Tosafos and on is addressing these types of questions. One Rishon might feel their distinction is good enough, and another might differ.</p>\n<p>Now you could ask, why wasn't the Gemara or the speaker more clear? This answer has a few points to it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The language of the Tannaim and Amoraim in the Gemara is not what that specific Rabbi literally said. Instead, it is the Gemara's (very succinct) distillation of their opinion. There was a lot more information about what the specific rabbi may have said available to the Gemara than to us. [E.g. see Rashba and Ritva to Yevamos 9a]</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Every work is written for the people of that generation. The Rambam [Intoduction to Mishna] says this is why the generations following R' Yehuda Hanasi had to write <em>braisos</em> and <em>Toseftos</em> to explain the meaning of the Mishnah for the following generation. Eventually, a Gemara needed to be written. And eventually, commentaries on the Gemara needed to be written. But to every generation, some things that were obvious to them were omitted, confusing the next generation. [See also Ramchal, Maamar al Hahagados]</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So maybe there is a contradiction, or maybe we are missing a point. To say definitely there is a contradiction would be hasty.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>There is a tradition passed down of how specific a generation of rabbis was expected to be. So Tannaim can be more cryptic than Amoraim. It is a judgement call from experience to know when someone should have said something or not. These points are also often discussed in Rishonim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See also Kovetz Hearos [siman 38; 6-7] who asks why sometimes the Gemara assumes a statement to be all-inclusive, and sometimes the Gemara says a certain statement is only in a very specific case. His resolution is that in regards to the specific halachah being taught, a statement is all-inclusive unless stated otherwise. In regards to a technical, side detail regarding how this halacha could be relevant, it might only be in uncommon situations that the Tanna did not specify. See there for examples.</p>\n<p>To give examples: Let's say you have a hypothetical scenario. The only authority you find to discuss the scenario rules <em>x</em>, and as far as you can tell nobody argues. In that case, it is reasonable to assume that the halacha is <em>x</em>, since as far as you know the halacha is unanimous.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a case where two authorities argue [e.g. Rashba and Rosh]. If the Rashba clearly makes two assumptions, and the Rosh clearly argues on one of them, is there any reason to assume he disagrees with the other? Not really, only one assumption is disputed, and the other remains unanimous, as in the first case.</p>\n<p>But let's say the Rosh did not explain his reasoning, he just states that the halacha is different than the Rashba. He must disagree somewhere, but on both assumptions or just one? Here again the rule of תפסת מיעוט תפסת תפסת מרובה לא תפסת comes into effect. If you can justify the Rosh's opinion without saying he argues on both assumptions, that is the Occam's razor approach. If you can explain the Rosh by saying he argues on either assumption, then you have a <em>safek</em> as to the Rosh's actual opinion.</p>\n<p>Let's say you do further research and discover that the Ritva argues on both the Rashba's assumptions. Now it is reasonable to assume the Rosh might also disagree with both the Rashba's assumptions, since you know the Ritva does. But you can't be sure.</p>\n<p>Now, perhaps both assumptions are connected, and there is a reason why assumption A leads to Assumption B. In that case, if the Rosh argues on A, he must also argue on B. But are the assumptions really connected? This is the sort of question that Acharonim deal with constantly. (Of especial note is the Mishna Lamelech, who laid out many such situations, and the Ketzos Hachoshen, who demonstrated these connections many times on the conceptual level, and resolved many problems this way.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based off of Chagigah 3b it appears that although there are two divergent arguments they are both correct. They are both given by Hashem or at the very least sourced in his Torah. The Ran in drashos haRan says that all arguments by the sages were told to Moshe Rabbeinu and this is a Gemara in Megilla if I recall correctly.</p>\n<p>Therefore, one approach would be to understand that they are not truly arguing, rather there is some subtle difference in the case or context that causes the argument. We often find the Gemara itself and Tosfot do this to resolve an argument, to make a change in the case. Though you are right that this is more common when it is the same author.</p>\n<p>I suppose you could learn the Gemara Chagigah 3b differently though, that is that the sages are making rulings opposite each other but at the root they are using principles that everyone agrees to. How to apply them there might be some disagreement, like how a doubt deals with a chazaka etc...</p>\n<p>At any rate there is truth in both conflicting opinions and we try to see how. And decide what are they really arguing over.</p>\n<p>Chagiga 3b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״בַּעֲלֵי אֲסֻפּוֹת״ — אֵלּוּ תַּלְמִידֵי חֲכָמִים, שֶׁיּוֹשְׁבִין\nאֲסוּפּוֹת אֲסוּפּוֹת וְעוֹסְקִין בַּתּוֹרָה. הַלָּלוּ מְטַמְּאִין\nוְהַלָּלוּ מְטַהֲרִין, הַלָּלוּ אוֹסְרִין וְהַלָּלוּ מַתִּירִין,\nהַלָּלוּ פּוֹסְלִין וְהַלָּלוּ מַכְשִׁירִין, שֶׁמָּא יֹאמַר אָדָם:\nהֵיאַךְ אֲנִי לָמֵד תּוֹרָה מֵעַתָּה — תַּלְמוּד לוֹמַר: ״כּוּלָּם\nנִתְּנוּ מֵרוֹעֶה אֶחָד״. אֵל אֶחָד נְתָנָן, פַּרְנָס אֶחָד אֲמָרָן,\nמִפִּי אֲדוֹן כׇּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים בָּרוּךְ הוּא, דִּכְתִיב: ״וַיְדַבֵּר\nאֱלֹהִים אֶת כׇּל הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה״.\nאַף אַתָּה, עֲשֵׂה אׇזְנֶיךָ כַּאֲפַרְכֶּסֶת, וּקְנֵה לְךָ לֵב מֵבִין לִשְׁמוֹעַ אֶת דִּבְרֵי מְטַמְּאִים וְאֶת דִּבְרֵי מְטַהֲרִים, אֶת דִּבְרֵי אוֹסְרִין וְאֶת דִּבְרֵי מַתִּירִין, אֶת דִּבְרֵי פוֹסְלִין וְאֶת דִּבְרֵי מַכְשִׁירִין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Those that are composed in collections [ba’alei asufot]”: These are\nthe sages who sit groups in groups learning Torah.

Rav says: If the Messiah is among the living in this generation, he is a person such as our saintly Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who was renowned for his sanctity, piety, and Torah knowledge. If the Messiah is among the dead he is a person such as Daniel, the beloved man.\"\n(Sanhedrin 98b)\nFrom hereit comes out (at least according to Rav Nachman and Rav) that Moshiach can rise from the dead and the redeem the jews.\nThe misconception that Moshiach cannot be from the dead is from the ramba\"m who says, \"נֶהֱרָג, בְּיָדוּעַ שֶׁאֵינוֹ זֶה שֶׁהִבְטִיחָה עָלָיו תּוֹרָה . if he is killed, we will know that he was not the one Torah has promised.\" however this is only if he is killed and not if he died, because if so why would the Ramba\"m who is very precise on words say killed?</p>\n\n\n",

A person should not be cruel\n  when forgiving [as implied by Genesis 20:17]: \"And Abraham prayed to\n  God...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>7 It is a mitzvah for a person who sees that his fellow Jew has sinned\n  or is following an improper path [to attempt] to correct his behavior\n  and to inform him that he is causing himself a loss by his evil deeds\n  as [Leviticus 19:17] states: \"You shall surely admonish your\n  colleague.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>A person who rebukes a colleague - whether because of a [wrong\n  committed] against him or because of a matter between his colleague\n  and God - should rebuke him privately.

Assuming the Sefardim kept their minhag the same, and the Ashkenazim changed the minhag, on exactly what day (and why?) did some Ashkenazi posek (who?) get up and announce that as of now, we're all going to put on our tefillin differently than we did yesterday? </p>\n\n\n",

This point was used to justify not saying the Shir twice in a day (morning and afternoon) but only in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/106435/what-time-of-day-was-the-world-first-created\">other</a> question asked about the timing of creation and includes the idea that according to some, the world was created (at least in thought) or was declared in the evening*. </p>\n\n<p>Are there any opinions that combine these and opine that the Shir Shel Yom should commemorate the creation by being said in the late afternoon/evening and NOT in the morning?</p>\n\n<p>*The Rashbam does almost seem to say that the morning's coming was the completion/declaration of the day, not the beginning, but that would put the Shir at the close, not the beginning of the day. \"שהעריב יום ראשון ושיקע האור, ויהי בוקר, בוקרו של לילה, שעלה עמוד השחר, הרי הושלם יום א' \" so the Shir should be said in the morning, but pointing to the day that has just passed?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is self-sacrifice acceptable to save one's child?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Generally speaking, Judaism doesn't take the same mindset for self-sacrifice as modern society. While we can have great respect for individuals who have given up their lives to save others, Jewish practice teaches that we aren't supposed to do such things and that sacrificing any life, including your own, isn't acceptable practice. It isn't your life to give.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is a simple one.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Much of Judaism has a huge emphasis on children and raising children. This makes sense considering how much of Judaism is centered around community and family life. Children are essential to this. </p>\n\n<p>My question, <strong>does Jewish law differentiate self-sacrifice for a stranger or other adult individual vs a parent self-sacrificing for their own children?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>While I suspect the same rule of <strong><em>\"it's not your life to give\"</em></strong> applies, I have to wonder if the Rabbis differentiate slightly because of the primal and deep connection one has to their children. </p>\n\n<p>Your children are as much your future as they are their own. An aspect of yourself lives on through your children on a certain level. So is there not an act of self-preservation occurring in the sense that a parent is sacrificing themselves to keep their children alive?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the classic works discussing this topic I do not remember anyone making a distinction between one's children versus other people.\n(See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/114019/21984\">here</a> including the answer there for a nice survey of the sources.)</p>\n\n<p>If anything the opposite would be true.\nIn his work <a href=\"https://www.diggingdeeperjewish.org/kishinievbookdetail/penguins.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Of Parents and Penguins\"</a> Rav Moshe Eisemann cogently presents the opposite argument. We in general do not subscribe to the idea that parents should sacrifice their lives for their children. Parents have an equally important life to be lived as their children. In fact we find the opposite- if a parent and child both need to study and the father's resources only permit one, with all else equal the father takes precedence. (Maseches Kiddushin Daf 30).</p>\n\n<p>This is in stark contrast with much of the animal kingdom which views continuation of the species as the highest need, often resulting in animals literally sacrificing their lives to help their children.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"https://torahmedia.com/fetch.php?fid=15186&bw=low&lnk=s&source=streamlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> to a short introduction Rav Eisemann gave to this book explaining this concept.</p>\n\n\n",

Given that an oven could only be used if the coals were raked out or covered with ash and that only materials which conserved heat and not add to it were allowed, was there ever warm food available on Shabbat day over 12 hours after Shabbat started? I read on Wikipedia (admittedly not always the most reliable source) that chulent only started in the middle ages when baker's ovens were available and people could leave food in it over an extended period of time since the ovens' fires were much more intense and ongoing. Any earlier references would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There were several different methods of leaving food on special stoves and insulating food employed in Talmudic times. One such method was leaving a pot over a special oven-like stove, another involved insulating pots with dry straw or fleece or sesame pulp, as well as wrapping pots in blankets. These methods were largely effective- so effective, in fact, that similar methods were banned as constituting cooking rather than warming or insulating.

A cheese that is kosher for Passover will have Kosher supervision during the process to ensure that all ingredients and equipment is Passover certified.</p>\n\n<p>In order for milk to be Cholov Yisroel, a Jew must be present and supervising during the milking process. However, if one relies on Rav Moshe Feinstein that government regulation is sufficient to ensure the Kosher status of milk, then it is considered kosher, but not Cholov Yisroel, even with nobody watching the milking process. </p>\n\n<p>Plain milk without vitamins or additives is Kosher for Passover, even without special Passover certification, so if a cheese is made from the milk, it can be Kosher for Passover even if it was only certified during cheese production and not during the milking process. In that case, the cheese would be Kosher for Passover, but not Cholov Yisroel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Certain industries have a strong chazakah that they only would put in certain ingredients. It would be harmful to their products tastes to use other ingredients or alternatively they have an industry tradition that limits potential ingredients that is well respected. </p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is why traditional domestic (USA) unflavored beer was considered to not need a hechsher - there is a purity standard that limits the options of what they could put in (this likely changed with the creative trend with beers in the last decade or so).</li>\n<li>Salt and sugar don't need a hechsher bc the factories are known to be pure.</li>\n<li>Bakers who are strongly traditional are considered to be muchzak that their plain bread doesn't contain non-kosher ingredients (you would have to know that they don't also bake creative breads in their ovens).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I suppose the cheese maker is ensured to have a sterile facility and grains would never be allowed in the factory but they are unable to fully ensure that an alternate dairy source would never be introduced.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think it's worth clarifying a misconception behind this question, which in turn will answer the question.</p>\n\n<p>Kashrus of milk can be divided into 3 categories: </p>\n\n<p>1) Chalav Akum- milk which has no supervision upon it. As expressed in Y.D. 115 Chazal forbade this milk due to concerns that non-kosher milk may be mixed in. No one permits this today.</p>\n\n<p>2) Chalav Yisroel- milk which was supervised by Jews. This is what is Chazal required in order for milk to be kosher. See Y.D. 115 and the commentaries for details- does a Jew have to watch the whole thing, or only the beginning, or just be present (even if he can't actually watch the milk go into the containers etc.) While there are these different standards discussed by the poskim, everyone agrees that you need Jews to be involved. (there are certain lenient opinions which are discussed in the context, but the accepted halacha is as mentioned above.)</p>\n\n<p>3) Chalav \"Stam\"- this is what is very common today. There's a major shailah whether we could rely on government supervision of milk to ensure that nothing was added.\nThis is a middle ground case. On the one hand, Jews aren't supervising the milking so it's not exactly what Chazal required.\nOn the other hand, by a government body taking responsibility for ensuring the purity of the milk, we can be sure that nothing was added. There's a halachic precedent that אנן סהדי, a widely know fact, can sometimes be the equivalent of actual testimony. Can we apply this to today's milk?</p>\n\n<p>This is a controversial question with many authorities taking both sides. Most famous among the lenient poskim is Rav Moshe Feinstein who wrote numerous teshuvos defending the lenient approach. See Igros Moshe Y.D. 1:47-49 (see Y.D. 2:35 that \"baalei nefesh\" should be stringent) and Chazon Ish Y.D.41:4 who leans towards the lenient opinion. (I have heard from talmidim of both Rav Yisroel Gustman and Rav Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg zatza\"l that both rabbonim also agreed that in principle the strict halacha is to be lenient.)</p>\n\n<p>According to these lenient opinions the milk is the equivalent of being cholov Yisroel; since otherwise it would be forbidden to be drunk.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are many rabbonim who ruled that government supervision is not good enough to be considered cholov Yisroel; see Chelkas Yaakov Y.D. 34, Minchas Yitzchak 1:138, 2:21, 10:31:16 and Teshuvos v'Hanhagos 1:441.</p>\n\n<p>So your question really boils down to the above dispute.</p>\n\n<p>In order to be kosher for Passover, it is only necessary to be certain that there is nothing problematic about the food. Actual supervision is not required if it's possible to ascertain that fact through other proofs (checking out ingredients, government regulations etc.)</p>\n\n<p>For milk this is the matter of dispute as mentioned above- is it enough to know that the milk has nothing non-kosher, or is there an actual requirement to supervise the milk?</p>\n\n<p>Therefore even the lenient opinions (which have been widely adopted) only use the term \"Chalav Yisroel\" to refer to milk which has been actually supervised. Otherwise they would refer to it as \"chalav stam\"- not chalav akum which is prohibited, but not chalav Yisroel which has been supervised.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/68737/21984\">here</a> for more on this topic including additional sources.</p>\n\n\n",

This question has already been dealt with on this site. However, the second part of your question, namely how to incorporate the verses in Daniel, has not as of yet been addressed, which is why I am writing this answer.</p>\n\n<p>Since the issue of Seder Olam has been addressed, I will only discuss the second issue, and refer you to here for the first:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92617/what-is-the-explanation-for-the-discrepancy-between-seder-olams-chronology-and?rq=1\">What is the explanation for the discrepancy between Seder Olam's chronology and that of historical scholarship?</a></p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say, every approach either accepts Seder Olam's chronology and reconciles it with modern scholarship, or vice-versa. Obviously, if one chooses to accept Seder Olam, the Pasuk in Daniel is self explanatory, as the Rashi you quoted indicates.</p>\n\n<p>However, if one accepts the chronology of modern scholarship (as I am inclined to do), the Pasuk in Daniel requires explanation. Ostensibly, Daniel is a contemporary to the Persian period, and it is far less feasible for him to be in error than it is for Seder Olam to be in error, written hundreds of years after the Persian Period.

So the reference to the Steipler Gaon should be excluded even from your own considerations.</p>\n<p>You don't limit sources to Jewish sources necessarily. So it seems to allow for archeological evidence.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that the story as recounted in the Torah of Moshe emphasizes that this judgment related to the 10 plagues was on both the Egyptians and their gods.</p>\n<p>And it is in that context that the discussion you cite from Sanhedrin 67b between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya must be understood.</p>\n<p>Hebrew words, generally have 3 letter roots. When you see a word that possesses more than that number of letters and certainly like צפרדע which has 5 letters, it suggests a compound word or something (a word or idea) from foreign origin.</p>\n<p>This type of word requires linguistic analysis to understand what it means and what is implied.</p>\n<p>This is what Rabbi Akiva attempted to do by saying from this single <em>Tzefarde'ah</em> it swarmed and divided into many and covered the entire land of Egypt. He is looking at the beginning letters of the compound word צפרדע and saying the root צפ״ר means <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A6%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%A3.1?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to bring to the surface, to overflow and flood</a> (הציף).</p>\n<p><strong>From Rabbi Akiva's opinion,</strong> it seems that the plague started from the source, the Nile River and somehow overwhelmed the canal system. So in his view, the flooding of the river was larger than anticipated and overwhelmed the smaller capacity of the irrigation system. <strong>The source <em>Tzefarde'ah</em> was bigger than the smaller <em>Tzefarde'im</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>So it appears that the idea that the <em><strong>first frog</strong></em> was larger follows the view and teaching of Rabbi Akiva.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a modern day example to understand the potential devastation, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/hurricane-katrina-levee-failures\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">consider the overwhelming of the levee/canal system in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina</a>. The waters from the ocean surge simply overwhelmed the flood canal drainage system and destroyed the entire city (See section: <a href=\"https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Damage in New Orleans</a>).</p>\n<p>This linguistic analysis was also what Rabbi Elazar was referring to in connection with Akiva's  <em>Aggadic interpretation system</em> when he questioned Akiva's interpretation and said that the word somehow meant something about <em>calling to others</em>.</p>\n<p>The second of the plagues was that of <em><strong>the frog</strong></em>. From archeological evidence it is understood that this is a reference to one of the gods of Egyptian worship related to the rising of the waters of the Nile at the time of flooding. This is referring to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heqet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Egyptian god Heqet</a>, who was depicted with the head or complete form of a frog. The function of this female god is described in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westcar_Papyrus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Westcar papyrus</a> as being connected with the final flooding stage, the process of birth and fertility.</p>\n<p>Much of the Egyptian worship was based upon the flow of water in the Nile and the idea that Pharaoh, as a god, controlled and altered that flow of water <em>(It rose and fell at his command.)</em> . If you investigate the commentaries of the Rishonim, you will discover that this was accomplished through an elaborate system of irrigation using canals and water screws to manage water. It meant that human beings were no longer at the mercy of, nor under the control of the Creator of the universe. So the word in the Torah, <strong>Tzefarde'ah</strong>, which is referring to the Egyptian god, <strong>Heqet</strong>, who is appointed over the floodwaters from the Nile and is depicted as a frog, appears to relate to that flow of water wherever it is in the system, river or canals.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the Egyptian name for their god itself, <em>Heqet</em>, has a linguistic similarity to the Hebrew word meaning <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%99.1?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>to hit</em> or <em>to strike</em> <strong>hakah</strong></a> (, היכה הכאה) which is also associated to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A0%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%A7%D6%B4%D7%99_I.1?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the root of <em>naka</em> or <em>naki</em> (נקא, נקי)</a> which is also associated with Tumah and Taharah the subject of ritual fitness. And that connection is mentioned in Rabbi Elazar's critique and question to Rabbi Akiva.</p>\n<p>And this leads to understanding the different meaning as presented by Rabbi Elazar, who suggests it means whistling or calling to others. This is from the initial letters of צפ״ר <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A6%D6%B0%D7%A4%D6%B7%D7%A8_I.1?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">which has a meaning of whistling or calling to the others to assemble.</a>, like the words צפיר or צפור. In that view, it suggests that the origin of the plague was somehow associated with the canals and irrigation (their being called to the river) and not from the river itself. Rabbi Elazar seems to be saying the fault was in the design of the systems capacity. The initial frog was not exceptionally large.</p>\n\n\n",

So if Shela/Yehuda would have done <em>chalitza</em>, Tamar would no longer have been able to marry into Yehuda's family anymore as Yevamos 10b says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר קרא (דברים כה, ט) אשר לא יבנה כיון שלא בנה שוב לא יבנה<br>\n  The passuk says regarding <em>Chalitza</em>:\"he did not build the house of his brother\" once he has not built 9i.e done chalitza) he may never build again (i.e do Yibbum).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tamar misunderstood Yehuda's intentions so tried to marry herself into the family much earlier.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*והנכון בעיני שהיה שלה ראוי ליבם אבל לא רצה אביו שייבם אותה ועודנו נער פן יחטא בה כאחיו אשר מתו בנעוריהם כי נערים היו אין לאחד מהם שתים עשרה שנה וכאשר יגדל וישמע למוסר אביו אז יתננה לו לאשה וכאשר המתינה ימים רבים וראתה כי גדל שלה בעיניה והוא עודנו נער לאביו כי אין לו עשר שנים והיה ממתין לו עוד אז מהרה תמר ברוב תאותה להוליד מזרע הקדש ועשתה המעשה הזה</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Before matan Torah there was no such thing as chalitza. The before matan Torah Yibbum isn't the same as after. After Maran Torah Yibbum is only performed by the brother of the deceased. The gemara Yevamos 5b implies there was no mitzva of Yibbum before Matan Torah. The Cli Chemda (Vayeshev 3) understands that yibbum before matan Torah was different because there was no option of Chalitza.</p>\n\n\n",

He only found one early source that explains why it should be על מצות (but not <em>against</em> במצות תפילין), which is <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=23994&st=&pgnum=21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orḥot Ḥayyim</a> (#16): ויש אומרים שמברכין עליהן על מצות תפילין, וסימן: ושמן על ראשך אל יחסר, שדרשו ז״ל אלו תפילין של ראש היא ב„על“, ואית דאמרי במצות תפילין. He suggests two reasons why על מצות won out: (1) the usual form of brachot is with ל or על, and not with ב, and (2) the phrase צוה ב isn't in Tanakh or the Mishna.</p>\n<p>In his second article, he quotes R.

In brief, R. Asher writes that all the Catalonian gemarot have במצות, and all his colleagues agree with him that it should be במצות. He writes that על מצות is a mistake, and that the fact that Rambam has על מצות in his Mishneh Torah is a copyist's faulty \"correction\" (although none of the Frankel, Qafiḥ, or Rabinowitz editions mention anything except על מצות), although he admits that he can't defend Rabbeinu Tam (who <a href=\"https://beta.otzar.org/#/book/627685/p/247/t/0884377711234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> explicitly that it should be על מצות) using that explanation. He also disagrees with על מצות on the basis of the rules for choosing between על and ל (where it seems that ב comes down on the side of ל, perhaps with the implied לקדשנו במצות תפילין, as suggested by <a href=\"https://beta.otzar.org/#/book/601353/p/85/t/0.268807443114302161234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Wieder brings the Ḥida (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7626&st=&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shiyurei Bracha on OḤ 25</a>) who quotes R. Asher ben Hayyim and answers R. Asher's objection to Rabbeinu Tam, and adds that every rule has its exceptions, and we shouldn't nitpick and change a bracha because of a rule. He says that since the Rambam, who was very picky about his nusaḥ, chose על מצות, we should keep it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why have Psalm 135 instead of 146 and omit Psalm 147 in Pesukei D'Zimra?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In all <em>siddurim</em> I know of—and <em>halachic</em> compendia that I've seen—<em>pesukei d'zimra</em> contains, among other things, psalms 145–150. However, in the <em>siddur</em> of Rav Sa'adia Gaon, he replaces Psalm 146 by 135 and omits Psalm 147. This can be seen <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (lines 16ff); although there is one manuscript that includes Psalm 146 and 147, the rest don't.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anywhere else that this is discussed? I'd be interested in (a) other omissions of Psalm 147 in this context, whether or not they mention Rav Sa'adia Gaon, and (b) discussions of Rav Sa'adia Gaon's divergence, whether from traditional or academic sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There's only one near-complete manuscript of this siddur, which the main text in the link you give comes from, but there are other fragments of manuscripts of this siddur, and as noted at the bottom right of the page you linked, there is a fragment that includes this same page and it instead indicates psalms 145-150 (as you would expect). You can see the actual page of that manuscript fragment on the Friedberg Genizah Project site <a href=\"https://fgp.genizah.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://fgp.genizah.org</a> - look up FGP No.: C241866</p>\n<p>Seems to me that what you are seeing is very likely a scribal error in the one primary manuscript in your link. As you say, 146 is skipped over, and 135:3 is cited instead of 147:1 (that you would expect). But if you look at the language of those two verses, they start out nearly the same, so it's likely the scribe conflated the two and wrote 135:3, intending to write 147:1. You wouldn't indicate the recitation of a whole psalm by referencing its 3rd verse. Scribal errors are unfortunately pretty common.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the fact that every other reference before and after Rav Sa'adia has Psalms 145-150, this seems like the logical conclusion.</p>\n\n\n",

They bribed ministers in order to thwart their plans all the years of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.\" and he continues (\" \" 6): \"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the start of his reign, they drew up an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.\" Ezra summarizes in short all those plots that weren't particularly successful, and describes in detail the happenings at the time of Artaxerxes (\" \" 7) who is most assuredly Cambyses the king. Artaxerxes is nothing but a title, and its meaning is \"the mighty ruler\". This was the title of most of the Achaemenids...in contrast to his father, Cambyses was the cruel enemy of all of the non-Persian religions. Because of this, the enemies of the Jews, who wanted to disturb the building of the Temple, likely found an attentive ear...\"</p>\n<p>In short, Rabbi Marcus explained Ezra 4 as follows: Verses 4-5 summarize the entire period of attempting to build the Temple from the time of Cyrus (Koresh) to the time of Darius I. In-between there was one other king: Cambyses (Kanbuzi), aka \"Artaxerxes\".\nNext, verse 6 skips forward and describes a post-Temple attempt to cause trouble for the Jews during the time of Achashverosh (Xerxes I) (and, as he writes in a footnote, prior to the Greco-Persian War and the story of Ester and subsequent rise of Mordechai) but is only mentioned shortly for not being too successful. Then verse 7 goes way back to Cambyses/\"Artaxerxes\" to describe the big disturbance in his time. Then verse 24 summarizes the remainder of Cambyses' reign until the fourth year of Darius I.</p>\n<p>Per this understanding, the Artaxerxes in these verses isn't Artaxerxes I <sup>1</sup>, who still lived after Achashverosh/Xerxes I, but Kanbuzi/Cambyses, son of Koresh/Cyrus. So the Artaxerxes of this chapter isn't any of the other kings previously mentioned, but there's still some time-jumping going about.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Zerachiah Halevi similarly wrote (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40787&st=&pgnum=58&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hamaor Hakatan, Rosh Hashanah 3b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אבל הפירוש הנכון לפי הפשט זה שכתוב \"ומטעם כורש ודריוש וארתחששתא מלך פרס\" (עזרא ו', י\"ד) שלושה מלכים היו, והרי הוא כמו שאמר מלכי פרס. והשנים הראשונים הוזכרו לעניין בניין הבית, שכורש היה המתחיל, ודריוש היה המשלים, וסמוך להם ארתחשסתא, הלך האחרון, שאף הוא בנה חומות ירושלים, כמו שמפורש בדברי נחמיה. ובכולן נתקיימה נבואת ישעיה, שכתוב: \"ובנו בני נכר חמתיך ומלכיהם ישרתונך\" (ישעיהו ס', י'). ואין זה ארתחשסתא הראשון, שציווה לבטל מלאכת בית המקדש. לפיכך סמכן הכתוב לשלושה מלכים הללו, ומזכירן בזה אחר זה, להכזיר שבחן וזכותן.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"But the correct explanation according to the simple understanding is what is written \"and by the order of Cyrus and Darius and King Artaxerxes of Persia.\" (Ezra 6:14), three kings there were, and so it is as is said kings of Persia. And the first two were mentioned in relation to the building of the Temple, for Cyrus was the one who started, and Darius was the one who finished, and adjacent to them was Artaxerxes, the last king, who too built the walls of Jerusalem, as stated explicitly in the words of Nechemiah, and in all of these came true the prophecy of Yeshayah. as it is said: \"Aliens shall rebuild your walls, Their kings shall wait upon you\". And this wasn't Artaxerxes the First, who commanded to stop the building of the Temple, so for this the text placed them close to one another these three kings, and mentioned them one after the next, to proclaim their greatness and merit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> According to Prof. Yaakov Liwer and Prof. Yehoshua Meir Grintz, it was during his reign that Ezra and Nechemiah came to Judea. According to Rabbi Marcus, it was during the reign of Artaxerxes II \"Mnemon\". Either way, it was many decades after the completion of the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the places where some add <em>amen</em> is at the end of the <em>brachot</em> after <em>shema</em>. In the evening, the series of <em>brachot</em> after <em>shema</em> consist of <em>emet v'emuna</em> אמת ואמונה (ending in <em>ga'al yisrael</em> גאל ישראל), <em>hashkiveinu</em> השכיבנו, and <em>yir'u eineinu</em> יראו עיננו (although some omit the latter, and some combine the last two into one <em>bracha</em>).</p>\n\n<p>From what I understand, the <em>amen</em> must come at the end of the series of <em>brachot</em> (see Mishneh Torah Tefillah 1:16–18, Rashi, Rosh, Rabbeinu Yonah, etc on the gemara). Thus, one would expect this <em>amen</em> to come at the end of <em>yir'u eineinu</em>. However, in Minhag Roma as practiced now in Israel (see <a href=\"https://524f1f52-e6e8-4762-a04d-3474189e42c4.filesusr.com/ugd/8cabfe_c6f24da374d445379b9cf2aeb4cd9327.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p 110 of the PDF, p 96 on the page), the <em>amen</em> comes at the end of <em>hashkiveinu</em>! Perhaps the intention is to separate between the Talmudic <em>brachot</em> (<em>ga'al yisrael</em> and <em>hashkiveinu</em>) and the Geonic <em>bracha</em> of <em>yir'u eineinu</em>, just like <em>amen</em> after <em>boneh yerushalayim</em> separates the Biblical <em>brachot</em> from the Rabbinic <em>bracha</em> in <em>birkat hamazon</em>?</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in literature on this point, and whether my guess is correct. In particular, I'm interested in discussions of whether to place <em>amen</em> after <em>hashkiveinu</em> or after <em>yir'u eineinu</em>, in contexts where both <em>brachot</em> are said independently (so, not where the latter is omitted or where it's combined with <em>hashkiveinu</em>, and not where <em>amen</em> is omitted entirely).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is the position of R' Yosef Karo (OC 236:4).

And furthermore the same person can at one time be a full prophet and at other times not be a full prophet. It is thus possible that Rambam means that Baruch was not a full prophet, but he was enough for the Talmud to call him a prophet, or that at a particular time Baruch did not qualify as a prophet but the Talmud refers to a different point in time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AFTER having explained prophecy in accordance with reason and Scripture, I must now describe the different degrees of prophecy from these two points of view. Not all the degrees of prophecy which I will enumerate qualify a person for the office of a prophet. The first and the second degrees are only steps leading to prophecy, and a person possessing either of these two degrees does not belong to the class of prophets whose merits we have been discussing. When such a person is occasionally called prophet, the term is used in a wider sense, and is applied to him because he is almost a prophet. You must not be misled by the fact that according to the books of the Prophets, a certain prophet, after having been inspired with one kind of prophecy, is reported to have received prophecy in another form. For it is possible for a prophet to prophesy at one time in the form of one of the degrees which I am about to enumerate, and at another time in another form. In the same manner, as the prophet does not prophesy continuously, but is inspired at one time and not at another, so he may at one time prophesy in the form of a higher degree, and at another time in that of a lower degree; it may happen that the highest degree is reached by a prophet only once in his lifetime, and afterwards remains inaccessible to him, or that a prophet remains below the highest degree until he entirely loses the faculty: for ordinary prophets must cease to prophesy a shorter or longer period before their death. Comp. \"And the word of the Lord ceased from Jeremiah\" (Ezra i. 1); \"And these are the last words of David\" (2 Sam. xxiii. 1). From these instances it can be inferred that the same is the case with all prophets. After this introduction and explanation, I will begin to enumerate the degrees of prophecy to which I have referred above.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp132.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Indeed, in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Tomer_Devorah.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tomer Devorah</a> the RaMaK refers to each of the Sefiros as \"Midah.\" Based on this we can essentially equate the two terms, at least in the context of R' Menachem Mendel MiVetebsk.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, the the 13 Midos of Rachamim in particular is referred to by the RaMaK in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Tomer_Devorah.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tomer Devorah</a> as \"the actions of the Crown (<em>Kesser</em>), which are the thirteen highest traits of mercy.\" So with regard to the 13 Attributes of Mercy in particular, there seems to be a connection between them and Kesser specifically.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the context, and following the general sense of the text, I understand that the Midot are some degree of perception of the intervention of G-d in the world. They describe the behavior of G-d from the bottom up point of view. When the text talk about sefirot, it describes the top down process leading to the materiality of the creation. And may be that we pray to reach this perception in several prayers, like Shmone Esre.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Pharaoh let the Jews out if he thought they were leaving for 3 days in order to serve hashem when they were alreadys serving hashem there?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is my understanding that Pharaoh truly believed that he was allowing the Jews out (even towards the very end) for a 3 day journey and the reason behind this journey was to go to Sinai in order that the Jews could perform sacrifices to their God. In addition, Pharaoh's understanding was that these sacrifices couldn't be performed in Egypt because the animals being sacrificed (Lamb) were a \"God\" of the Egyptians and it was too dangerous for the Jews to sacrifice in Egypt. Given all this, we know, from midrashim that Pharaoh was informed of the events of Shabbos Hagadol where the Jews were tying lamb to their bedposts in preparation for a sacrifice, which should have raised some red flags to him since he hadn't given a go-ahead to the Jews to leave. What is even more concerning to me though is why did Pharaoh allow the Jews to leave at all given that on the night of maakot bechorot when Pharaoh approached Moshe's residence, presumably, he saw ample evidence of a sacrifice being performed right there in Egypt! The easy answer is that he just let them out and sent soldiers with the Jews, because he just wanted the plagues to end and he would worry about it later, but this seems a little simplistic and I wanted to see if the MY crowd would be able to add some insight.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Par'o already suggested that they stay and bring karbanos in Egypt and Moshe answered him that they could not worship Hashem in a country full of idols. Indeed, when Par'o begged for the plague to end, Moshe answered that he had to go outside the city to ask for the plague to end.\nBy the end of the ten plagues Par'o had panicked to such an extent that he was no longer thinking of excuses, he just wanted to get rid of them.  That is why after he had a chance to work on himself he tried to go after the Bnai Yisrael and force them back.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The question is really, why didn't Pharaoh let the Jews out earlier? Any semi-rational person would have realized that, for whatever reason, the Jews' God wants them to leave the country for a while and is willing to turn over Egypt to get this done. It doesn't really matter if one understands <em>why</em> he wants them to leave, but clearly he does and Egypt is going to suffer if they can't leave. After only a few plagues, one should realize that conditions in his country aren't going to get any better, so he had better let the Jews do whatever they wanted if he wants his country to survive. And Pharaoh did admit that he was wrong in keeping them, and that Hashem was bringing these plagues upon him, but he didn't let them leave because Hashem \"hardened the heart\" of pharaoh so that he wouldn't let the Jews leave, and Hashem would be able to finish all of the plagues and show both the Egyptians and the Jews that he is in control of heaven and earth. After the Jews left Egypt, when Pharaoh again chased them into the sea, it was again because Hashem \"hardened his heart\" and compelled him to chase after the Jews even though it made no sense to do so. </p>\n\n<p>So the final answer: Past a certain point, Hashem was controlling every action of Pharaoh so that His miracles would be apparent.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why no Oral Law in Rambam's 13 principles of faith?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam laid down 13 principles of faith (ikkarim) in his commentary on Sanhedrin 10:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>God exists and created everything,</li>\n<li>God is One,</li>\n<li>God has no body,</li>\n<li>God is eternal,</li>\n<li>God alone should be worshiped,</li>\n<li>God revealed Himself through the prophets,</li>\n<li>Moses was the greatest of prophets,</li>\n<li>The Torah we have today is the very same one God gave us on Mount Sinai,</li>\n<li>The Torah will never change,</li>\n<li>God knows all our actions,</li>\n<li>God rewards good and punishes evil,</li>\n<li>The Messiah will come; and</li>\n<li>The dead will be resurrected.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What surprises me is that there is no mention of the Oral Law.  Sure, it is implied in the 13th, but the Rambam could have made it crystal-clear, considering how important that point is, say by changing the 8th to:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>The Torah we have today, both Written and Oral, is the very same one God gave us on Mount Sinai.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why didn't he do it?  Was he deliberately ambiguous?  Back in my native Egypt he was surrounded by Karaites who denied the Oral Law, but he fought them tooth and nail, so I doubt he was being ambiguous to win them over.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the answer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The premise of your question is incorrect. In the 8th principle the Rambam explicitly mentions the oral law.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you were referring to the Ani Maamin formulation found in the siddur. That was not written by the Rambam and generally is not a great summary of what he actually writes. You are correct that the 8th Ani Maamin does not mention the oral law. It also misses several other key aspects that the Rambam mentions and adds ideas that he does not say. In other words, the 8th Ani Maamin is probably the least accurate of all of them when compared with what the Rambam actually says. </p>\n\n<p>An interesting side note: the 6th Ani Maamin is also widely divergent from what the Rambam says. Rambam merely requires belief in prophecy. The ani maamin adds that prophets are infallible and always speak the truth. In fact, according to how the Abarbanel understood the third chelek of Moreh Nevuchim that prophets sometimes make mistakes, the Rambam would not even accept this as true, let alone think it is an Ikkar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See principle number 8.

    "content": "# Redeeming s'dei achuzah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This has bothered me for many years - but I am not even sure of the right question to ask!<br>\nThe Torah at the end of Parshas Bechukosai (Vayikra 27:16-22) describes the law of makdish s'dei achuzah (consecrating one's ancestral field) and how to redeem it. It is clear from verse 18  וחישב לו... עד שנת היובל ונגרע מערכך that we are picturing the object being redeemed as the field <em>until</em> yoveil. That is what is worth 50 shekel, that \"rental\" [this is an averaged value, like many things in that section]. He could redeem it shortly before yoveil, and it might cost only one shekel, depending.<br>\nNow that he has redeemed it, he keeps the field <em>forever</em> after yoveil, something that is clearly worth a lot more than 50 shekel.<br>\nHowever, if he doesn't redeem it at all, or if the gizbar sells it to anyone else at any point before (verses 20-21), then he will never get it back, and it goes to the cohanim after that yoveil.<br>\nIt comes out in a way that seems very \"uneven\" to me: by redeeming the value of the field till yoveil (<= 50 shekel, plus a chomesh), he is actually buying back the use of the field <em>forever</em> (much more than 50 shekel). It is as if he is redeeming a s'dei mikneh, but receiving a s'dei achuzah!<br>\nAs I said, I'm not sure of the right question, but how do others understand this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Erkekha</em> on <em>Sede-achuza</em> is not an action that has something to do with real-estate business. <em>Sede-achuza</em> gets a fixed value, that has nothing to do with it's market value:</p>\n\n<p>ואם משדה אחזתו יקדיש איש ליהוה והיה ערכך לפי זרעו זרע חמר שערים בחמשים שקל כסף</p>\n\n<p>If anyone consecrates to the LORD any land that he holds, its assessment shall be in accordance with its seed requirement: fifty shekels of silver to a ḥomer of barley seed.</p>\n\n<p>Also, look at the previous verses on the same <em>Parash</em> that use the exact same term:</p>\n\n<p>...איש כי יפלא נדר ב<strong>ערכך</strong> נפשת ליהוה\nוהיה ערכך הזכר מבן עשרים שנה ועד בן־ששים שנה והיה ערכך חמשים שקל כסף בשקל הקדש\nואם־נקבה הוא והיה ערכך שלשים שקל\n...\nואם־מך הוא מערכך והעמידו לפני הכהן והעריך אתו הכהן על־פי אשר תשיג יד הנדר יעריכנו הכהן</p>\n\n<p>... When anyone explicitly vows to the LORD the equivalent for a human being,\nthe following scale shall apply: If it is a male from twenty to sixty years of age, the equivalent is fifty shekels of silver by the sanctuary weight;\nif it is a female, the equivalent is thirty shekels.\n...\nBut if one cannot afford the equivalent, he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall assess him; the priest shall assess him according to what the vower can afford.</p>\n\n<p>Well, these values do not reflect the actual condition of the person, other then he's\\her's age and gender, right? Also, you get consideration if you are poor?! That's not how you do business! So <em>Erkekha</em> is just a way to make a donation to <em>beis Hamikdash</em>, and not about getting good deal for the gizbar or the vower . </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Just a <em>suggestion</em> toward an answer, but one that helps me at least not be as bothered.<br>\nAs some of the answers and comments pointed out, the Torah has a number of responses when something is made hekdesh. Maybe I'll divide them into two main classes:<br>\n1) Things like cherem - the object becomes hekdesh and never goes back to the owner at all. A korbon is mostly similar, unless it gets a mum.<br>\n2) Things like arachim, where the object isn't meant to be hekdesh; the hekdesh is just a way to make a monetary contribution.<br>\nThe point of the first is to give away the object. By cherem the Torah emphasizes that it never comes back (לא יגאל).<br>\nThe point of the second is to make a donation. Perhaps doing it in this way shows one's love or appreciation to Hashem for the object. The gemara in Arachim has more examples, \"nidri alay\", \"mishkli alay\" (giving his value, giving his weight) along with the Torah's \"erki alay\": various implementations of the same idea.<br>\nMost cases of hekdesh could be either. When a person is makdish his donkey, or his field, he might be doing one of two things: really giving away the donkey or field, or using it to make a monetary contribution. If the latter, he would redeem it right away. That's different from anyone <em>else</em> buying it from hekdesh; only he is the \"owner\", only he pays a chomesh along with the value. (There's a well-known Shiltei Giborim somewhere who says that even arachim itself is a momentary hekdesh on the person, immediately removed and replaced by a debt...)<br>\n[There is a third possibility: he planned to give it away forever, and then <em>changed his mind</em>. In that case he would be using pidyon as a way to undo his mistake.]<br>\nIn the case of s'dei achuzah, probably the gizbar is going to try and sell the field right away. If so, this man needed to plan this from the first, have the money for redemption on hand and ready. He is makdish and redeems, back to back. If so, he would be implementing the second possibility, using this as a way to make a donation focused around this field.<br>\n[See the discussion Arachim 30b if he is even <em>allowed</em> to borrow money to redeem it.]<br>\nThis way of picturing things helps me feel better about the \"unevenness\" issue. When he redeems, he is not \"saving himself a lot of money\", as my question suggested. The Torah is talking about two different people, one giving away his field forever [where the money is beside the point, and indeed it might be impossible to place a true value], another who isn't doing that at all.<br>\n[Of course, plans can change, and the person can belatedly try to switch paths in the middle, if the gizbar is slow enough. I don't know if that affects what I'm saying.]</p>\n\n\n",

The ashes of the Para Adumah are required to purify anyone who is Tumei Meit. While it is true that this cannot be done today, anyone who has never come into contact with a dead body is simply not Tumei Meit.</p>\n\n<p>However there is another issue here. Rambam writes in Hilchot Tumat Met 11:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טֻמְאַת אֲוִיר אֶרֶץ הָעַכּוּ''ם לֹא עָשׂוּ אוֹתָהּ כְּטֻמְאַת\n  עֲפָרָהּ אֶלָּא קַלָּה הִיא מִמֶּנָּה. שֶׁעַל טֻמְאַת עֲפָרָהּ\n  שׂוֹרְפִין תְּרוּמוֹת וְקָדָשִׁים. וְהַמִּתְטַמֵּא בְּגוּשָׁהּ טָמֵא\n  טֻמְאַת שִׁבְעָה וְצָרִיךְ הַזָּיָה שְׁלִישִׁי וּשְׁבִיעִי. אֲבָל\n  הַנִּטְמָא בַּאֲוִירָהּ אֵין צָרִיךְ הַזָּיָה שְׁלִישִׁי וּשְׁבִיעִי\n  אֶלָּא טְבִילָה וְהַעֲרֵב שֶׁמֶשׁ. וְכֵן תְּרוּמָה וְקָדָשִׁים\n  שֶׁנִּטְמְאוּ מֵחֲמַת אֲוִירָהּ תּוֹלִין לֹא אוֹכְלִין וְלֹא\n  שׂוֹרְפִין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially, this means Rabbinically, everyone outside of Israel is Tumei Met.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while this will not be true for the majority, there are very likely some minority of people who have never left Israel or come into contact with a Met (most likely these would be young children). Thus, it is correct that almost everyone is Tamei Met, but this is not a categorical rule as much as a rule of thumb which likely has exceptions.</p>\n\n\n",

I wonder, however, if this sovereignty of God over every reality can be considered compatible with some limits regarding His omnipotence. I have seen for example that according to Ralbag it is absurd to think that HaShem could have created the universe ex nihilo, because this would be materially impossible even for the Creator: this master therefore does not seem to believe in an absolute omnipotence of HaShem. I am not referring here to the concept of divine self-limitation, which is the result of a precise will of the Great King, but precisely to the case of activities that God would not be able to carry out. It is a compatible concept with the Torah? I personally doubt that HaShem has the power to perform an act against Himself, such as creating a more powerful being than Him, or even deciding to end His existence (I speak by paradox obviously).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How difficult would it be to make a simple Hebrew/Jewish Calendar covering the last 25 years with no access to the Internet?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>How difficult would it be to make a simple Hebrew/Jewish Calendar covering the last 25 years using paper and pencils (including days of the week and corresponding Gregorian dates), with no access to the Internet, but knowing the current Hebrew and Gregorian date the day you began?</strong></p>\n\n<p>To make a simple, purely Gregorian calendar covering the last 25 years this way is a labourious task and takes about two or three evenings, but would be possible for any average person, provided they remembered when the last leap year was.</p>\n\n<p>However, I came accross an article about Dr. Alan Rosen's <em>The Holocaust's Jewish Calendars: Keeping Time Sacred, Making Time Holy</em>, which discussed the illicit calendars made in Auschwitz. Obviously, these were made under unimagiably difficult conditions (AND they included the weekly Torah portions and holidays), but I was struck by the fact that the article mentioned one of the makers had studied under a teacher who \"rigorously taught his young charges the rules for composing Jewish calendars\". Furthermore, according to timeanddate.com, the Hebrew/Jewish Calendar features \"a body of complex regulations, exceptions, and mathematical rules\".</p>\n\n<p>If you didn't include the holidays and Torah portions, how easy would it be for the average person to make such a calendar, and how long would it take?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If you have access to the internet for a <em>little</em> while, you can download my video where I go through the entire calculation. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/113711/video-course-on-jewish-calendar\">Video course on Jewish Calendar</a>. There are software tools available there (calculator, web page for the Tur's keviyuyos) that are helpful as well.<br>\nYou could do it with pencil and paper after watching that - I admit that I didn't! I'm guessing that it would take me a couple of hours to get the molad(s), because I'm not such a fast or accurate calculator, and then a few more to work out the Yomim Tovim, and [if I didn't have the Tur's chart] to figure out the parshiyos.<br>\nNow repeat 24 more times.<br>\nUpdate: I should add that if you <em>do</em> have the Tur's chart (OH 428) and the Arba'ah Sha'arim chart available on Wikipedia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Four_gates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Four_gates</a>) or elsewhere, you could do this a <em>lot</em> faster. You basically just add a standard amount to the molad of the previous year, look it up in the Arba'ah Sha'arim chart to get the year type, then look in the Tur's chart for the whole calendar. Then repeat 24 times. Maybe an hour total once you'd get the hang of it?</p>\n\n\n",

Yet, G-d is very near, in a sense, for G-d is everywhere.

Thus, it is unrealistic to say that G-d's presence is only felt in churches or Shul.

All we understand is the fact that He exists, that He is a Being to whom none of His creatures is similar, who has nothing in common with them, who does not include plurality, who is never too feeble to produce other beings, and whose relation to the universe is that of a steersman to a boat; and even this is not a real relation, a real simile, but serves only to convey to us the idea that God rules the universe; that is, that He gives it duration, and preserves its necessary arrangement.

    "content": "# Were the Essenes considered Apikorisim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The ancient Essenes are known as being an highly ascetic sect, with many mystical and monastical practices.</p>\n<p>In fact, Rav Aryeh Kaplan seems to imply that some of our Kabbalah actually originated from the Essenes, who supposedly inherited them from the Nevi'im, and from Pythagorean teachings (which the Greeks themselves admit they got from the Ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Phoenicians). In his introduction to his translation of the Sefer Yetzirah (pp. xvi-xvii) he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From the Sefer HaTagin we learn that Rabbi Nehunia learned at least\nsome of the mysteries from Menachem, who served as vice president of\nthe Sanhedrin (Supreme Court) under Hillel. It was when Menachem\nresigned his post that Shammai was appointed in his stead.54 Most\nauthorities identify this individual with Menachem the Essene,\ndiscussed by Josephus.55 Menachem had once seen Herod as a child, and\nhad prophesied that he would be king. Because of this, when Herod\nlater ascended the throne, he honored Menachem as well as the other\nEssenes. Due to his relationship with Herod, Menachem could no longer\nmaintain his position in the Sanhedrin. If we accept the above\ntradition, Nehunia ben HaKanah might have received at least some of\nhis mystic knowledge from Menachem the Essene. This would indicate\nthat the Essenes were conversant in the mystical arts, and that they\ntaught them to at least some of the Talmudic masters. Josephus states\nthat the Essense made use of the names of angels, and were able to\nforetell the future, using various purifications and methods of the\nprophets. Even more significant, Josephus also likens the Essenes to\nthe Pythagoreans. Since the the Sefer Yetzirah apparently contains\nsome elements that resemble the teachings of the Pythagoreans, it may\nbe that the text was preserved by the Essenes during the period that\npreceded the Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But in the Artscroll commentary on the Amidah, they are labeled by Artscroll as <em>heretics</em>, with minimal explanation. In explanation of the origins of the blessing of Velamalshinim (The Complete Arstcroll Siddur, Tenth Impression, p. 107) it states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The blessing was composed in response to the threats of such heretical\nJewish sects as the Sadducees, Boethusians, Essenes, and the early\nChristians. They tried to lead Jews astray through example and\npersuasion, and they used their political power to oppress observant\nJews and to slander them to the anti-Semitic Roman government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So were the Essenes heretics, or just some highly ascetic groups of people?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While it is possible that there <em>may</em> be allusions to the sect, traditional rabbinic sources do not explicitly discuss the Essenes. Accordingly this is a case of contemporaneously interpreting data from non-canonical sources (Josephus, Philo, Dead Sea Scrolls, etc.).</p>\n<p>Clearly R. Kaplan understood the Essenes to likely be, or at least have been at some point, a conduit of kosher Torah ideas. He tentatively makes the case for the identification of one particular Essene and then goes on to note that his (and the Essene) affiliation with the Sanhedrin ceased due to their fealty to Herod. R. Kaplan did not make the case that the Essenes beyond that departure point continued to be a source for legitimate traditional content.</p>\n<p>The Artscroll/Mesorah editors, in their assessment, were content to lump the Essenes together with anti/non-rabbinic sectarians. Without being privy to the behind the scenes dialogue we cannot know with certainty why the Artscroll editors felt the way they did. We also do not know whether R. Kaplan would have agreed with this assessment of post-Herodian Essenes (and unfortunately, as he is deceased, we cannot ask him).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, IMHO, anything beyond simply noting their positions as stated would enter into the territory of speculation and opinion-based territory (which is off-topic here).</p>\n\n\n",

This means that anyone who was aged 20 at the time of the Golden Calf (over a year prior) would eventually die in the desert, but not anyone who was not then 20, <strong>even though they had turned 20 by the time of the Spies</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I think there are a couple of ways we could understand this Rashi. It could be saying that anyone aged at least twenty at the time of the Golden Calf would die in the desert as soon as they hit 59. This would mean that anyone born on or after 17th Tammuz 2428 would survive to enter the land in Nissan 2488 aged approximately 59.5.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we can couple this Rashi with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.30b.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta'anit 30b</a> (as explained by Rashi there) which records that those slated to die did so every year on 9 Av, until the final year in the desert. This means that the last ones to die were those who were in their 60th year on 9 Av 2486. Therefore anyone born on or after 10 Av 2427 would be able to enter the land in Nissan 2488 at the age of approximately 60.5.</p>\n\n<p>2. As you mentioned, Chazal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.121b.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 121b</a> note that the decree also did not apply to the entire tribe of Levi, nor to anyone aged over 60 at the time of the decree. The <em>gemara</em> there records traditions that Achiyah HaShiloni, Machir ben Menashe and Yair ben Menashe were extremely old (Achiyah had known Amram, and Machir and Yair were born while Yaakov was still alive) and were still able to enter the land (without giving precise ages for any of them).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Note that the decree was that those that were between 20 and 60 who were eligible to be in the army  were condemned to die in the desert. At each tisha b'av, those that reached 60 during the previous year died. On the year of entering the land, no-one died on tisha b'av. However, theoretically those who had been above 60 (and were now above 100), could have lived to enter the land. This means that those who were eligible to enter the army at the time of the decree all died. You should also note that since Shevet Levi were not eligible to be counted from 20 to 60, they were not included in the decree of death.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.121b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baba Basra 121b</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב המנונא לא נגזרה גזרה על שבטו של לוי דכתיב (במדבר יד, כט) במדבר\n  הזה יפלו פגריכם וכל פקודיכם לכל מספרכם מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה מי שפקודיו\n  מבן עשרים יצא שבטו של לוי שפקודיו מבן שלשים</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Hamnuna says: The decree of death pronounced for the generation of\n  the spies was not decreed upon the tribe of Levi, as it is written:\n  “Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all those who were\n  counted among you, according to your whole number, from twenty years\n  old and upward” (Numbers 14:29). The verse is interpreted: The decree\n  applies to one whose count in the census is from the age of twenty and\n  up, excluding the tribe of Levi, whose count is from the age of thirty\n  and up. Ahijah was a Levite, and he was not subject to the decree.</p>\n  \n  <p>אלא אמר רב אחא בר יעקב לא נגזרה גזירה לא על פחות מבן עשרים ולא על יתר\n  מבן ששים לא על פחות מבן עשרים דכתיב מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה ולא על יתר מבן\n  ששים גמר ומעלה (ויקרא כז, ז) ומעלה מערכין מה להלן יתר מבן ששים כפחות\n  מבן כ' אף כאן יתר מבן ששים כפחות מבן עשרים</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: The decree of death was not decreed\n  either upon those less than twenty years old or upon those more than\n  sixty years old at the time of the sin of the spies. The Gemara\n  explains: Not upon those less than twenty years old, as it is written:\n  “From twenty years old and upward” (Numbers 14:29). And not upon those\n  more than sixty years old, because he learns that there is a verbal\n  analogy between “and upward” in the verse cited, and “and upward” from\n  the halakhot of valuations, in the phrase: “From sixty years old and\n  upward” (Leviticus 27:7). Just as there, concerning valuations, more\n  than sixty years old is comparable to less than twenty years old, as\n  there is a distinct category of those between the ages of twenty and\n  sixty, so too here, more than sixty years old is comparable to less\n  than twenty years old insofar as those older were not subject to the\n  sentence. Yair, son of Manasseh, who was already older, did not die in\n  the wilderness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The main thrust was something like \n'How could you justify making a kollel so tens of students can advance in their scholarship, when that same money could be used to bring back thousands of Jews who have become irreligious? Who could justify spending money on such a luxury?'</p>\n\n<p>The book was quoting this as a criticism of the Rebbe, since after the Holocaust almost all branches of religious Judaism set up kollelim to facilitate Torah study, to create new scholars who would replace those killed during the Holocaust hy\"d. These kollelim were founded with the encouragement and support of almost all gedolei yisrael from all circles- litvish, chasidish, national-religious, chareidi, sefardi etc.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know where the Rebbe's letter is? Are there explicit writings from other gedolei yisrael arguing against him on this specific point?</p>\n\n<p>This is an example of the kind of sources that I'm looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1422617114\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This book</a> about the founder of Arachim says that he presented the question to Rav Shach for his organization: Should he focus on making contact with more people or follow-up with fewer people?

    "content": "# By what authority, and roughly when, did Judaism concede that adoption of Noachide laws was an acceptable alternative to conversion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I.  Introduction.  </p>\n\n<p>According to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>B. Shabbat 145b-146a.  \"Rabbi Yoḥanan then explained to them: Why are gentiles ethically contaminated? It is because they did not stand on Mount Sinai. As when the snake came upon Eve, i.e., when it seduced her to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, it infected her with moral contamination, and this contamination remained in all human beings. When the Jewish people stood at Mount Sinai, their contamination ceased, whereas gentiles did not stand at Mount Sinai, and their contamination never ceased. Rav Aḥa, the son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What about converts? How do you explain the cessation of their moral contamination? Rav Ashi said to him: Even though they themselves were not at Mount Sinai, their guardian angels were present, as it is written: “It is not with you alone that I make this covenant and this oath, but with he that stands here with us today before the Lord our God, and with he that is not here with us today” (Deuteronomy 29:13–14), and this includes converts.\"</li>\n<li>B. Yevamot 103b.  \"The Gemara answers: He implants filth in her and contaminates her, as her body accepts his semen. As Rabbi Yoḥanan also said, based on his understanding that the serpent seduced Eve into having sexual relations with him: When the serpent came upon Eve, he infected her with moral contamination, and this contamination remained in all human beings. When the Jewish people stood at Mount Sinai their contamination ceased, whereas with regard to gentiles, who did not stand at Mount Sinai, their contamination never ceased.\"</li>\n<li>B. Avodah Zarah 22b.  \"...as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: At the time when the snake came upon Eve, at the time of the sin of her eating from the Tree of Knowledge, it infected her with moral contamination, and this contamination lingers in all human beings. The Gemara asks: If that is so, a Jew should also be suspected of engaging in bestiality. The Gemara answers: With regard to the Jewish people, who stood at Mount Sinai and received the Torah, their contamination ended, whereas in the case of gentiles, who did not stand at Mount Sinai and receive the Torah, their contamination has not ended.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>II.  Questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>By what authority, and roughly when, did Judaism concede that a non-Jew's adoption of Noachide laws was an acceptable alternative to full conversion to Judaism?</li>\n<li>By what authority, and roughly when, did Judaism decide that the moral contamination inherited by non-Jews was abated by their acceptance of the Noachide laws?</li>\n<li>By what authority, and roughly when, was it decided that the moral contamination inherited by non-Jews no longer exists at all?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>There seem to be a few underlying assumptions which need to be clarified.</p>\n\n<p>All of mankind is obligated in the 7 Noahide laws, as the gemara teaches (Sanhedrin 56a-b.)</p>\n\n<p>At Har Sinai, the Jews accepted a covenant with G-d, whereby Jews committed to keeping G-d's commandments and will, and G-d committed to making the Jews a \"priestly \"kingdom\" and a \"sanctified\" nation. (Exodus 19:3-8)</p>\n\n<p>We don't find any obligation for the Non-Jews to similarly accept this covenant. (There are sources which indicate that G-d perhaps offered other nations the chance to receive the Torah, but I'm not aware of any source which indicated any sort of obligation for them.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus the first question is slightly misconstrued- there was never a \"concession\" that accepting the Noahide Laws is acceptable instead of converting; when the Jews underwent the national conversion which was at Har Sinai, there never was an expectation for the other nations to follow suit. </p>\n\n<p>(I'm avoiding the point about pre-judaic religion. There is discussion of how all the nations of the world could have had the same relationship with G-d as the Jews, but they lost their stature through various sins until the family of Avraham Avinu came and regained the stature. This is discussed in classic works like Derech Hashem. I'm not going into this since the OP asked about Noahide vs. conversion to Judaism, which only is relevant from Har Sinai onwards.)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding 2) and 3) I think the initial assumption is incorrect. The OP implies that the \"moral contamination\" was abated by accepting the Noahide laws, and that it no longer exists. I don't think this assumption is correct.</p>\n\n<p>The Noahide laws address themselves to the basic moral code. The Torah relates to being \"holy\". The \"moral contamination\" is related to the concept of holiness i.e. spiritual sensitivity to sanctity (kedusha). This level of sensitivity only exists in the full sense by Jews.\nEx: if a non-Jew eats a cheeseburger nothing negative happens. If a Jew eats a cheeseburger he has done a terrible sin and has done spiritual damage. Eating a cheeseburger isn't a \"moral\" crime, it's a violation of the laws of sanctity.  </p>\n\n<p>In this sense there is still the \"moral contamination\" i.e. the lack of spiritual sensitivity to the sanctity of the commandments. \nAs mentioned in the answer to 1) part of the covenant between the Jews and G-d is that the Jews will be a \"sanctified nation.\" It's this sanctity which is being referenced.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam writes in the laws of kings, that at Mount Sinai Moshe Rabeinu recieved the direct commands from G-d, the Creator of the universe, at mount sinai, to encourage all nations (descendents of Noach) to accept upon themselves the 7 mitzvos that Noach was earlier commanded</p>\n<p>Conversation, on the other hand, has always been optional and not necessarily encouraged, as the talmud says (don't remember exact source) \"converts are difficult for the people of Yisroel\"</p>\n<p>So to answer the question:</p>\n<p>\"By what authority, and roughly when, did Judaism concede that adoption of Noachide laws was an acceptable alternative to conversion?\"</p>\n<p>By what authority? By the authority of the Creator of the universe</p>\n<p>Roughly when? As of now, 5781 from the creation of the universe, roughly 3333 years ago, did Judaism concede that adoption of Noachide laws are an acceptable alternative to conversion</p>\n<p>Ah, but why haven't the earlier generations been encouraging them onto the masses in the same way as now?</p>\n<p>Because it was dangerous at the time, the earlier nations used to be a lot more hostile and dangerous towards the Jews, especially if they were being convinced to change their lifestyles etc</p>\n<p>This is the only time pretty much that the people of Yisroel can safely interact with non jews and explain to them what they must do etc. without being in the same kind of hostile environment</p>\n\n\n",

Like  the Midrash states, that the stone could be rolled up and the script on the tablets could be read from both sides and that the letters 'mem' and the 'samech' that were on the luchos both miraculously existed.</em> (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think what he is implying that this sapphire material that the Luchos were made out of was of an essentially G-dly state. It was this Divine-infused material that allowed them to be miraculous in many ways namely, that it could be rolled up, read from both sides etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the mitzvos that are not forever?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This Shabbos, someone noted that the Sefer Hachinuch says that there are no mitzvos at all in this parsha (Bamidbar). I responded at once, That's absurd. It seems like it contains dozens of mitzvos!<br>\nOf course, what they meant is that there are no mitzvos <em>l'doros</em>, for all generations - one of the requirements that the Rambam lists in his Sefer Hamitzvos (Shoresh 3). So all the commandments to count the nation, to set up degalim, to redeem the Levi'im, how to cover all the vessels when they move... None of those are part of the תרי\"ג mitzvos.<br>\nSo I am wondering:<br>\na) Has anyone ever worked out a list of all these \"temporary\" mitzvos in the Torah? Don't eat the fruit of that tree; Avraham, lech lecha; Yitzchak, don't leave Eretz Yisroel; Yaakov, take your family and flocks and return; Moshe, don't go too close to the bush...; Eat the Korbon Pesach with your loins girded, staff in your hand... How many are there?<br>\nb) If no one has bothered, why not? Are they less important than the 613 mitzvos? - I spent a couple of years studying Zevachim, even though we can't do it (yet), and even though many great people who studied it died without ever seeing the Beis Hamikdash. Maybe I should also study how to stay away from Har Sinai, because we did it once? Is it so clear that there is a difference between our past and our future?<br>\nc) Nothing can be part of the Torah except what Moshe Rabbeinu taught us; afterwards, לא בשמים היא. What about one-time mitzvos? Is Hashem's commandment thru a navi (Go, speak to Achav. Your child will be a nazir from the womb.) any less a mitzvah than Hashem's one-time commands to Moshe, just because it cannot become part of the Chumash? Should those be counted too, if someone counts them?<br>\nUpdate: judging by some comments, I should explain (c): For sure any command by a navi is completely obligatory. I meant a different question: Is there a special category of temporary commands by a navi that are fundamentally different because they were actually given as mitzvos of the Torah. For instance, the laws of degalim were followed for forty years; the laws of wrapping the keilim when the mishkan moved were presumably followed for hundreds of years, up until the final move into the Beis Hamikdash. Same with all the laws of how to deal with heter bamos - all skipped by the Rambam. But when they learned Shulchan Aruch, that was part of what they learned, all that time. These <em>seem</em> to be part of Toras Moshe. That seems different to me from the one-time commands to Eliyahu - or for that matter even the one-time commands to Avraham Avinu which are <em>quoted</em> in the Torah but don't translate into a command to Israel. Or not.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I asked R' Tzvi Berkowitz shlit\"a for his take. Here was his response [email]: \"We study the mitzvos that we have even if we can't do them right now. The mitzva that Moshe Rabeinu was given to not come close to the bush was never given to us.

    "content": "# Magnetic Word Games On Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is a magnetic version of scrabble permitted to be played on shabbos? Generally, Scrabble is not considered writing (although there may be other problems if you usually write while playing) but <em>Shemiras Shabbas Kehilchasa</em> (beginning of perek 15 as well as other modern day sefarim) mentions that the deluxe versions that are framed are a problem of <em>Koseiv</em>, so I'm wondering if the magnetic version is a problem? The comparison would be that both of these editions makes it morre permanent. If so, please specify if <em>mi'dioraysa, mi'drabanan</em>, or just as a <em>chumra</em>. \nAlso if there is a problem of <em>tofeir</em> please adress that as well, although generally these type of games aren't permanent at all.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Playing scrabble on Shabbos is a point of contention, and when magnetic, it makes it additionally troublesome. The full breakdown is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting, building on your point mentioned in parentheses, based off the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Adam%2C_Shabbat_and_Festivals.38.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Odom klal 38, se'if 11</a>) that it would be forbidden to play Scrabble as it normally entails writing down the score, even if one is definitive that they won't do any writing. The <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=617721&width=-17&scroll=0&pagenum=38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Tiltulei Shabbos p.24</a> adds for this reason it is a Kli Shemelachto l'issur - something whose primary use (in this case writing) is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we ignore this first point, we still need to know whether or not putting tiles of letters to form words is deemed a derivative of writing? The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14585&st=&pgnum=70&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush 340:4</a> speaks about a book that has writing along the pages so that when one opens and closes the book he both erases and reconstitutes the letters (i.e. the melachos of mechika and koseiv). This is transferable to Scrabble in that one is both bringing letters together and disassembling to create words. </p>\n\n<p>However, according to the Taz this can be disregarded as the whole purpose of a book is to be opened and closed much like a door - (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.340.3?lang=bi&p2=Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.340.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz</a>). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzvi_Pesach_Frank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank</a> in his responsa <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20947&st=&pgnum=297&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Har Tzvi</a> notes that even the Levush would agree that bringing together two complete letters is not a case of Koseiv, as his whole argument is predicated on joining and separating letter fragments. The letters on the side of a book are destroyed when opened each time and then reformed when closed. As such, separating two letters is not considered erasing, nor is returning letters adjacent to each other viewed as writing. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is why the <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/6543/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU writes</a> - \"<strong><em>Accordingly, those who play such games as Scrabble on Shabbos should be careful to maintain a small space between the letters....\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>However, it then adds...</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Games that hold the letters locked in place (such as Deluxe Scrabble and Boggle) are not permitted because of koseiv</em></strong>.\" - (This is also highlighted in Sefer Tiltulei Shabbos p.24)</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that the regular flat boards of Scrabble are okay as the tiles are largely disparate and aren't fixed in place. Indeed, Rav Moshe (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&st=&pgnum=227&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe OC 135</a>) writes \"אבל הכא שלא מחובר כלל אינו ענין כתיבה כלל\" - \"<em>But here where there's no connection/attachment at all it is not considered writing at all.</em>\" The Deluxe version has grooves which keeps the tiles fixed in place much like the magnetic version. As such, the magnetic version ensures that the tiles adhere to the board much more strongly and there is a sense of 'chibur' - connection which is thus regarded as a stronger form of Koseiv and not allowed on Shabbos. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>“Shulchan Shlomo” (Shabbos, Vol. III, Siman 340, note 35) records an oral ruling by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, that one may take plain letters and put them together to form words. This is not considered “writing”, as they have no “basis”, and they maintain their status of “individual” letters. However, taking plain letters and putting them in a “basis” would be prohibited, as this would be the equivalent of attaching letters to a sheet of parchment, which is the melacha of “writing”. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman added; that for this reason, it is prohibited to attach magnetic letters to a metallic tray on Shabbos. While intrinsically magnets may be used on Shabbos (for example, a magnetic chess game, see ibid. 314:1), and the temporary connection “chibur arai” need not concern us vis a vis the prohibitions of ”boneh” and “soser”, nevertheless, affixing magnetic letters is prohibited as a form of “writing”. </p>\n\n<p>He rules there, that this applies to “chelkei tzurah” (magnetic puzzles of pictures), and “kal vachomer” (all the more so) in the case of “osiyos” (letters) “chelkei osiyos” (partial letters). </p>\n\n<p>[”Shulchan Shlomo” does not elaborate if this action would be included in the “di’oraysa” Torah based prohibition, or prohibited by rabbinical ordinance, “mi’derabbanan”. However, see the extensive discussion in Shu”t Maaseh Choshev (vol. 2:11) by Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Halpern regarding the issue of combining letters into words].</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pitchu-shearim.org/?p=1605\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> by Rabbi Yoav Sternberg concludes it's allowed.</p>\n\n<p>The main part of the article says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשלוקחים אותיות בעלמא וקובעים אותן בבסיס, הרי זה כמחבר אותיות לקלף…\n  ...ומהאי טעמא הוסיף מרן זללה\"ה, דאסור לקבוע אותיות מגנטיות במגש מגנטי\n  בשבת…</p>\n  \n  <p>אלא שיש לומר, שכל האמור בדברי הגרש\"ז הוא רק כאשר לוקח אות שאין לה רקע,\n  ומחבר אותה לרקע. במקרה כזה יש לומר...[שאסור] אבל כשיש אות שלמה, שאינה\n  יכולה להתקלקל, כגון שהיא כבר כתובה על גבי רקע....\n  [נראה שמותר]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you take letters by themselves and set them in a frame, it's like attaching letters to a parchment... and that is why our Rabbi ZT\"L [Hagrasha\"Z] you can't set magnetic letters on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>But we should say that the Hagrasha\"Z said when the letter has no background and the latter is attached to a background, that is when we say [it's forbidden].... but when the letter is whole, so the letter cannot be broken, like when there is background [it's allowed].</p>\n\n\n",

I'd highly recommend it to answer these types of questions.</p>\n<p>In the back of the book, they have beautifully translated the Iggeres of Rav Shreira Gaon (one of the prominent Gaonim ~900CE), where he answers in great detail many questions posed from Karaites about the veracity of the Oral Torah and its origins.\nThere is a section where he discuss \"The Mishnah Over the Tosefta\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Now, it should be pointed out] that] if R' Chiya disagreed in a Beraisa with Rebbe, we do not listen to him. For example, Rebbi decided a law and registered it in a Mishnah without attributing it to any Tanna, although it had been a subject of dispute between Tannaim. If R' Chiya subsequently shows [in the <em>Tosefta</em>] that a disagreement had indeed taken place, even though the Mishnah does not show the entire picture, the final halachah is nevertheless decided in accordance with the Mishnah. We will not follow [in this case] the usual rules of deciding between different Tannaim, such as: In a dispute between R' Meir and R' Yose the halacha follows R' Yose (<em>Eruvin 46b</em>). Rather, the halachah is decided according to R' Meir, if his is the sole opinion mentioned by Rebbi in the Mishnah. However, we do follow the aforementioned rules when the Mishnah itself mentions the different opinions. Thus, where there is a dispute between R' Meir and R' Yose [explicitly mentioned in the Mishnah], the halachah would be decided according to R' Yose.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if R' Chiya held that the opinion of R' Meir, which is recorded in the Mishnah as having been opposed to that of R' Yose [and therefore not accepted as the final halachah], was the correct one, and he thereby presented it in the <em>Tosefta</em> as the sole opinion, we do not accept R' Chiya's position.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Since R' Chiya was the disciple of Rebbi, whatever Rebbi taught him is what [R' Chiya] would say, and R' Chiya had only that which Rebbi had.</p>\n<p>In fact, strictly, more weight is given to an <em>inference</em> from a Mishnah than to another <em>opinion</em> explicitly presented in a Baraisa [i.e. <em>Tosefta</em>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then points out that there is a preference given to R' Chiya and R' Oshaya's Beraisos over other collections of Baraisos, since there were errors and inaccuracies in the others.</p>\n<p>Just some background info from some other sources:</p>\n<p>Note that there are known to be two Tosefta's: One from the Tanna R' Nechemyah (learned straight from R' Akiva), which is not the same as the Tosefta we have in the back of our Gemara. The one in the back of our Gemara is the Tosefta of R' Chiya (the first of a number of R' Chiya's).</p>\n<p>Regarding R' Nechamya's Tosefta, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.86a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 86a</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סתם תוספתא ר' נחמיה</p>\n<p>An unattributed baraita in the Tosefta [is in accordance with the opinion of] Rabbi Neḥemya</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding R' Chiya, the composer of the Tosefta in the back of our Gemaras, was a living contemporary of Rebbi and one of Rebbi's students (Rebbi being regarded as a Tanna, but at the beginning of the Amoraim). Tosfos sheds a little light on where the Mishnah and this Tosefta come from in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.94b.6?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 94b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכך לא פריך לקמן אלא מברייתות דהוה שונה ר' חייא שהיה תלמידו של רבי...לפי שהמשניות היו קודם רבי אלא שרבי סדרם, אבל ברייתות היה שונה ר' חייא מה שהיה מוסיף רבי על המשניות</p>\n<p>And that explains why the Gemara only asks later from the Beraisos that R' Chiya taught, who was a Talmid of Rebbi... <strong>since the Mishnayos preceded Rebbi, and Rebbi merely arranged them, whereas the Beraisos that R' Chiya learned were what Rebbi added on to the Mishnayos.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Mishnayos, per Tosfos, were merely arranged by Rebbi but hold the strength of an earlier generation. R' Chiya recorded Rebbi's teachings on the Mishnayos and arranged them into the Tosefta (with his student R' Oshaya), as mentioned in Chullin 141.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone know according to Ramban  what is the miracle involved in the birth of Dovid Hamelech/his ancestry? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה אתן לך עד נאמן על מה שאמרתי ידענו כי מעת בוא ישראל לארץ עד לדת אדונינו דוד היה כשלש מאות ושבעים שנה והימים יתחלקו לארבעה דורות שלמון ובועז ועובד וישי ויגיע לכל אחד מהם צ\"ג שנה והנה כלם זקנים קרוב לאברהם והיו מולידים כל אחד בשנת מותו שלא כדרך כל הארץ כי אין החיים בזמנם מאה שנה ואם הוליד אחד מהם בבחרותו כמנהג יהיו האחרים זקנים מאד יותר מאברהם ויהי בהם הפלא גדול יותר מאד כי ימי האדם בדור אברהם ארוכים ובשנות דוד חזרו למחציתם ואולי חיו יותר כי אפשר שהיו לשלמון ימים רבים בבואם לארץ ולכן נתנו אנשי הקבלה והם חכמי אמת לעובד ימים רבים והוא נס נסתר נעשה לאבי המלוכה בן הצדקת הבאה לחסות תחת כנפי השכינה וכן יזכירו באמו ארך ימים רבים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It's a question of arithmetic.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban assumes that David was born approximately 370 years after Bnei Yisrael entered the Land. But only four generations spanned that time: Salmon (who was the son of Nachshon ben Aminadav and was one of those who entered the land), Boaz, Oved and Yishai. (See Rut 4:18-22.)</p>\n\n<p>This means that each generation spanned an average of 370/4 = 93 years i.e. each of them fathered a child at 93 (assuming Salmon entered the land as an infant; otherwise this number only increases). You could argue, says Ramban, that some of them may have fathered their child at a younger age, but then that just means that the others would have had to father children at an even older age.</p>\n\n<p>This is an even greater miracle than in the days of Avraham, because at this time people were not living extended lifetimes (unlike Avraham who, although he fathered a child at 100, lived until 180).</p>\n\n<p>Because of these calculations, Ramban says, Chazal believed that Oved (son of Rut and David's grandfather) had an unusually long lifetime, fathering Yishai towards the end of his very long life.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud discusses the beracha, or lack thereof, on Demai in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=23&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat 23a</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתיב רב עמרם הדמאי מערבין בו ומשתתפין בו ומברכין עליו ומזמנין עליו ומפרישין אותו ערום ובין השמשות ואי אמרת כל מדרבנן בעי ברכה הכא כי קאי ערום היכי מברך והא בעינן והיה מחניך קדוש וליכא אמר אביי ודאי דדבריהם בעי ברכה ספק דדבריהם לא בעי ברכה והא יו\"ט שני דספק דבריהם הוא ובעי ברכה התם כי היכי דלא לזילזולי בה רבא אמר רוב עמי הארץ מעשרין הן</p>\n<p>R. Amram objected: Dem'ai can be employed for an 'erub and for a joint ownership;  a benediction is pronounced over it, and grace in common is recited after it, and it may be separated by a naked person, and at twilight. But if you say that every Rabbinical [precept] requires a benediction, here, when one stands naked, how can he pronounce a benediction: lo! we require, therefore shall thy camp be holy [that he see no unclean thing in thee], which is absent? — Said Abaye, A certain Rabbinical law requires a benediction, whereas a doubtful Rabbinical law does not. But what of the second day of Festivals, which is a Rabbinical [institution] based on doubt, and yet it requires a benediction? — There it [was instituted] in order that it should not be treated slightingly. Raba said: The majority of the 'amme ha-arez tithe  [their produce].</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_23.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Rava and Abbaye debate <em>why</em> there is no beracha on Demai, but everyone apparently agrees that there is no beracha. However, the implication of the reasons given is that these are specific factors by Demai which make it not require a beracha, but if not for these specific factors then it <em>would</em> require a beracha. Perforce, then, the general rule must be that a Biblical doubt requires a beracha.</p>\n<p>Indeed, R.

Akiva Eiger's famous list apparent deviations? But if this isn't a long established alternate reading, why isn't anyone else bothered by the slip, when the whole gemara here is based on the fact that 1 Chronicles 17:9 and II Samuel 7:10 are supposed to have contrasting meanings when actually in the Tanakh text as we know it those two pasukim just use two synonyms (לבלות and לענות)? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Shai_on_I_Chronicles.17.9.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Shai on that verse</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא יוסיפו בני עולה לבלתו. פרק קמא דברכות רב הונא רמי כתיב לענותו וכתיב לכלותו. בתחלה לענותו ולבסוף לכלותו. ובפירש\"י כתבי לענותו בספר (שמואל ב' ז') וכתיב לכלותו בד\"ה. בתחלה כשנבנה הבית נבנה ע\"מ שלא לענות עוד אויבים לישראל ולבסוף כשחטאו נגזר עליהם עינוי ותפלתם מגינה עליהם מן הכליון ע\"כ. נראה שבספרו הי' כתוב לכלותו בכ\"ף וכן פירש בעל מכלל יופי ענין כליה ואף רד\"ק הביא בספר שמואל מדרש הנזכר ופירש כפירש\"י. אמנם בספר השרשים הביאו בשרש בלה בבית וכן בכל הספרים (זולתי מעט מזעיר) כתוב לבלתו בבי\"ת:</p>\n<p>[After citing the relevant passage in Berachos and Rashi ad loc:] It seems that Rashi's text of the verse had לכלותו, with a chaf.

(as expressed eloquently <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/judaism/rabbi-i-have-a-problem/what-can-i-do-if-i-am-haunted-by-a-dybbuk-1.49397\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>Indeed, this concept of possession is brought down in Nach.

Many scholars such as the Rabbi Yitzchak Luria (the Arizal), his student Rav Chaim Vital and Rav Moshe Cordovero all explored this notion of evil possession.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most famous of studies is the Shaar HaGilgulim (lit. the Gate of Reincarnation) which is based primarily on the Zohar in Parshas Mishpotim where gilgulim are discussed, it is from the writings of the Arizal and the book was recorded by his foremost disciple, Rabbi Chaim Vital. It is here that the concept of possession is discussed as a 'Ruach haRa'ah' an evil spirit.</p>\n<p>The end of Shaar HaGilgulim relates a happening with Rav Chaim Vital who was called to oversee an exorcism of an evil possession that had taken hold in a girl called Esther. With the help of 10 gifted talmidei chachomim (Jewish sages) he commanded the spirt to depart. This caused Esther’s left foot to bounce upward which was interpreted as the spirit leaving her small toe.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, Rav Moshe Cordovero employed the term 'Ibbur Ra'ah' - An Evil Impregnation drawing on the fact that this possession attaches itself to soul.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Chaim Sofer (1870-1939, Baghdad and Israel), building on this explains in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kaf_HaChayim_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.46.32.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaf HaChaim, Orach Chaim 46:32</a> that is possible during one's lifetime, one might become 'pregnant' with one of these… Each night, one's soul gives an accounting before its Creator, and is judged for its deeds.

What is it based on?  The quotes the Rambam adds don't seem compelling to me.  Perhaps he indirectly wants to encourage us to earn a living (something he <strong>very</strong> strongly stresses elsewhere), which is usually done during the day, so the night is all that's left for study, and he wants to make it appealing?  Does his last line have to be so chilling?</p>\n\n<p>But isn't it also a function of the individual?  Personally, I am a night owl and always do my best work at night when all is quiet and there are no distractions.  But my wife is the exact opposite.</p>\n\n<p>Is this teaching commonly applied?

Here, on the second halachah in the SA, he answers your second question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עונשו מרובה - ... ועיין במ\"א דלשינת האדם בלילה אין לזה שיעור קבוע אלא תלוי בכל אדם לפי כח בריאותו ועכ\"פ לא ישתקע בשינה יותר מדאי וכדאיתא במשנה [סנהדרין פ\"ח] שינה לצדיקים רע להן ורע לעולם ופירש\"י מפני שאינם עוסקין בתורה</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>His punishment is great</strong>: ... The Magen Avraham states that there is no set amount for sleeping, rather, it depends on the person according to his strength. In any case, he should not indulge himself in sleep more than is necessary, as it says in Sanhedrin that sleeping is not good for Tzaddikim. Rashi explains because they are not involved in Torah [while asleep].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mainly wanted to translate the main sources here for you so you could see them and investigate more per your liking. Note that there is more spoken of this in the Shulchan Aruch haRav (there is an <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/importance-of-learning-torah-at-night/#_ftnref10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English source  for that here</a>) and more in the Zohar. In the SA, many of the other nosei keilim (besides the Shach) speak on it. On the pesukim, the Shlah, Torah Temimah, and many others talk to this idea. </p>\n\n<p>At the face of the matter, it appears the main idea is that one should yearn and strive to maximize his learning to the fullest during the gift we have of the 24 period of day and night (as we definitely have a chiyuv for the entire day \"לֹֽא־יָמ֡וּשׁ סֵ֩פֶר֩ הַתּוֹרָ֨ה הַזֶּ֜ה מִפִּ֗יךָ וְהָגִ֚יתָ בּוֹ֙ יוֹמָ֣ם וָלַ֔יְלָה\"). Instead of listening to his Yetzer Hara saying \"night is dark and only for sleeping\" (or nowadays where there are so many distractions that can take us away from learning), rather he should strive to maximize the time spent learning according to his strength (per the MB and the Shach). This is beside the other ideas that one's learning is stronger in the evening, and the Schechinah dwells with him, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I heard a beautiful idea (from the Mussar sefarim) that, at night, the sky \"opens up\" and one can see the now uncovered sky that is not anymore masked by the sun's light. This openness is representative of the fact that night is best for learning and doing cheshbon hanefesh when the world is \"opened up\" to him and the world is quiet.</p>\n\n\n",

For the special case of the deceased's brother, the Torah allowed what would otherwise be prohibited, and actively obligated it. </p>\n\n<p>So what's going on in Ruth, as happened with Judah and Tamar, is pseudo-Yibbum. (Backing up -- when Naomi says \"even if I gave birth to more sons now\" ... a brother not yet born is not subject to actual yibbum.) If I get the family tree correct, the first right went to Ploni Almoni, who was Machlon's uncle; once he refused, it went to Boaz, who was a cousin. </p>\n\n<p>Malbim actually points out that Ruth 4:13 reads: <em>Boaz took Ruth, she became his wife, and they had relations.</em> This means that a full marriage ceremony was needed before relations -- something that wouldn't (at the Biblical level) be required in a true-Yibbum situation either.</p>\n\n\n",

It's not that they're grouped together to show that they were originally said that way, it's that they are grouped together because that is how they were discussed in the <em>beis midrash</em>.

He says that according to the <strong>Mabit</strong>, the Jews weren't in <em>sukkos</em> in the wilderness, as they had the Clouds of Glory. If so, the concept of דופן עקומה, which is a <em>Halacha LeMoshe MiSinai</em> which only applies to a <em>sukkah</em>, didn't apply. As such, he wants to say that the <em>Halacha LeMoshe MiSinai</em>s of גוד and לבוד also didn't apply in the wilderness, <strong>since they were taught together</strong>. Since this was before the <em>beis midrash</em> of <em>Chazal</em>, presumably he means taught together <strong>at Sinai</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

Egyptians tried to drown the Jewish newborns they got drowned in the red sea, or the generation of Noach sinned with the heat of forbidden relations and they were burned with scalding waters. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.12a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[Rosh Hashanah 12a]</a> I don't see any difference between מדה כנגד מדה of an individual as opposed to a community; מכ\"מ is the way Hashem runs the world and it doesn't seem like there are any exceptions.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As others have states the incidence with the <em>Mitzriyim</em> drowning in the sea for throwing Jewish babies into the water and the incidence of the <em>Meraglim</em> complaining about <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>  and not being allowed to enter E.Y come to mind. In both cases, an entire generation was punished <em>Midah K'neged Midah</em>. It is also brought down that the Ten Makkos were <em>middah keneged middah</em> for the pain and suffering the *Mitzrim * caused <em>Bnei Yisroel</em>.</p>\n<p>However, I believe it is important to distinguish between the punishment of the <em>meraglim</em> and the punishment of <em>Mitzrayim</em>.</p>\n<p>Why does G-d punish <em>Midah KeNeged Midah</em>? There are two reasons. One is due to the חֶסֶד (kindness) of Hashem - so that the individual (or <em>tzibur</em>) is aware of his misconduct and knows there is what to rectify. Another reason is that the very act of sinning creates a <em>Malach</em> (angel) that punishes the person. Just as in the laws of nature, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In the spiritual world, a bad deed creates a 'force' that is equal (i.e, similar to) the bad deed committed.</p>\n<p>Why two types of punishments? Because after all, there are two types of sinners. One type of sinner knows he is doing the wrong thing and does it anyway (<em>l'hachis</em>). The other type of sinner believes he is doing the right thing (he sins <em>L'shem Shamayim</em>). For the first type of sinner, G-d does not need to punish <em>Midah K’neged Midah</em> in order to awaken him to the fact that his actions are unjust. He knows that better than anyone. In this case, <em>Midah K’neged Midah</em> is simply the natural result of  transgressing the word of G-d. Just as in the natural world, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Every bad action creates a force in nature - which punishes the person. Naturally, the force created takes upon itself a similar צורה (<em>Tzurah</em>) to the sin that was committed. For the second type of sinner, G-d punishes <em>Midah K’neged Midah</em> so that he knows he transgressed G-ds will. Once he is made aware of this fact, he is likely to do תשובה‎ (repent) without further intervention.</p>\n<p>In the case of the <em>Mitzriyim</em>, the purpose of the punishment was not to get them to do תשובה‎. The punishment itself was the goal and the purpose. However, as it relates to <em>Klal Yisroel</em> the punishment is actually an act of kindness as it awakens them to became aware of their misdeeds and become better people.</p>\n<p>Regarding the parallel between our treatment of anti-vaxxers and covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.thelakewoodscoop.com/news/2020/06/kamtza-bar-kamtza-101-a-thought-provoking-response.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Lakewood Scoop</a> is not the first (or last) one to draw this conclusion.</p>\n<p>R’ Chaim Kanievsky Shlit'a has famously stated that covid-19 is a punishment for excessive <em>Lashon Harah</em>. Just as one who speaks <em>Lashon Harah</em> must be isolated (Badad Yaishaiv) from his friends so too we were isolated from our social circle during covid-19. I believe the <em>Chofetz Chaim</em> says the reason a <em>metzora</em> must sit in isolation is because he caused others to avoid the person he spoke negatively about.</p>\n<p>In a lecture to the Orthodox community in Cincinnati, Ohio, Rabbi Brog discussed the subject of Midah K'neged Midah in depth and how each and every facet of covid-19 was a direct punishment for the harsh and cruel way we treated anti-vaxxers.</p>\n<p>He quoted the great Mashgiach of our time Rabbi Dan Segal Shlit'a as saying that covid-19 was a punishment for the way we treated anti-vaxxers.</p>\n<p>He also quoted the grand Rosh Yeshiva of the preeminent and largest Yeshiva in the world (Bais Medrash Govoha) who echoed this sentiment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The User @The GRAPKE incorrectly stated that \"Bar Kamtza \"felt better\" after his humiliation had been redressed by the destruction of the beis ha'mikdash\" and therefore Hashem allowed him to revenge his shame.</p>\n<p>Nowhere in the <em>Gemara</em> or חז״ל is this \"feeling better\" mentioned as a prerequisite to receive punishment for shaming or humiliating someone else. This idea was taken out of @The GRAPKE back pocket. All the <em>Gemara</em> says is that בושה (humiliating someone) is so destructively powerful that it can even cause the destruction of the <em>Beis Hamikdash</em>.</p>\n<p>In accordance with what has been postulated above it would make sense that Hashem punishes Midah K’neged Midah precisely when the individual or public is unaware that they committed a sin. For if the individual is aware that his actions were wrong, why would he need special divine intervention to inform him of such? Divine intervention is required only when the sinner (or sinners) believe they haven’t sinned or even worse, that they are doing the ‘right’ thing.</p>\n<p>@The GRAPKE makes an erroneous assumption:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the case of Coronavirus, since the reason for any action against\nthe anti-vaxxers was in order to protect the community from disease,\nit is not possible to say that a punishment should occur middah\nke'neged middah for these actions (with regards to the second notion\nof middah ke'neged middah), because this treatment was one born of\nconcern and not of selfish harshness. Simply put, it is not possible\nthat we should say that Hashem should punish someone or a tzibbur for\ndoing a mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thelakewoodscoop.com/news/2020/06/kamtza-bar-kamtza-101-a-thought-provoking-response.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writer of the letter</a> actually addresses this issue:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Netziv observes that we find a great deal of shefichas damim at\nthe time of the second Beis HaMikdash. Why then does the Gemara say\nthat there was no shefichas damim? The Netziv provides a frightening\nanswer. During בית שני, people didn’t kill because they were evil.\nThey killed only in the name of good and with holy intentions. They\nbelieved (just like we do) that those who they killed deserved it\nbecause they were not performing the Mitzvos properly. The Netziv\nexplains that the people themselves were unaware that they committed a\ncrime as it was righteous and justified in their minds.</p>\n<p>What is the barometer for unjustified hatred? Examining our own\nbehavior is the only way to know whether we are guilty of double\nstandards. We say that we are unwilling to expose ourselves to a\ncertain level of risk but do we take similar risks in our everyday\nlives? Do we take risks that are far, far greater than the risk we’re\nbeing exposed to? Do we take those risks even when not absolutely\nnecessary? If the risk of a vaccinated child being exposed to an\nunvaccinated child was even close to the risk of driving or many of\nthe other risks we take in our lives, I wouldn’t voice my\ndissatisfaction with the current matzav. In reality, we are talking\nabout a risk that is AT MOST 1/450th of the risks we take every day.</p>\n<p>Where does this discrimination come from if not hate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imagine the government imposing strict sanctions against any Jewish religious gathering (i.e, maximum 2 people could join a indoor minyan) while allowing churches and mosques to gather freely without any restriction? Of course, this would be the epitome of hypocrisy. It's the same thing in this case. We either expose our self to a certain level of risk or we don't. We can't expose ourselves to a level of risk that is 450 times greater than the risk of being around an unvaccinated child and then claim we are embarrassing them \"L'shem Shamayim\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A lot of good examples have been brought already but I am reminded of something in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.9a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 9a</a> where it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר להו רבא לבני מחוזא במטותא מנייכו עושו בהדי הדדי כי היכי דליהוי לכו שלמא במלכותא וא\"ר אלעזר בזמן שבהמ\"ק קיים אדם שוקל שקלו ומתכפר לו עכשיו שאין בהמ\"ק קיים אם עושין צדקה מוטב ואם לאו באין עובדי כוכבים ונוטלין בזרוע ואעפ\"כ נחשב להן לצדקה שנאמר (ישעיהו ס, יז) ונוגשיך צדקה</p>\n<p><em>Rava said to the people of Meḥoza: I beg of you, <strong>strive with each other to perform acts of charity and righteousness, so that you will live in peace with the government, since if you do not act charitably toward each other, you will end up paying fines to the government</strong>. And Rabbi Elazar says: When the Temple is standing, a person contributes his shekel for the Temple service and achieves atonement for his sins. <strong>Now that the Temple no longer stands, if people act charitably, it will be well for them; but if not, the nations of the world will come and take their money by force.</strong> The Gemara comments: And even so, the money taken from them by force is credited to them as if they had freely given charity, as it is stated: “And I will make your oppressors charity” (Isaiah 60:17).</em>(Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see here also that the people of Mechoza were told to act on an individual level in a charitable way and failure to do so would effect them collectively by the government imposing fines. Similarly, failure to give tzedaka in an age devoid of the Beis Hamikdash can result in the nations of the world coming and taking our money from us as a collective.</p>\n\n\n",

I would have said instead that immersing something in a vessel filled with water <strong>doesn't work</strong>, not that <strong>it is forbidden</strong>. Why does <strong>Tosafos</strong> say it is forbidden? Is this just an interesting way of saying it doesn't work? Or it's referring to the fact that it will lead to forbidden things, such as someone spiritually impure eating <em>kodshim</em> or entering the Temple? Or is there a bona fide prohibition. If so, what is it?</p>\n\n<p>I did a search on Otzar HaChochmah using the wording of <strong>Tosafos</strong> and found many <em>Rishonim</em> use this expression.

As it is written: “And when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking with her” (Ruth 1:18)</em>.\n(Sefaria Translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara understands this to mean that when Naomi set out to return to Eretz Yisrael and Ruth insisted on joining her, this was when Ruth wished to convert. Naomi attempted to dissuade her, but Ruth persisted. The verse states that once Naomi saw Ruth’s resolve to convert, she desisted from her attempts to dissuade her.</p>\n<p>This is reinforced in the Midrash - Rus Rabbah (2:22):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֹּאמֶר רוּת אַל תִּפְגְּעִי בִי לְעָזְבֵךְ לָשׁוּב מֵאַחֲרָיִךְ (רות א, טז), מַהוּ אַל תִּפְגְּעִי בִי, אָמְרָה לָהּ לֹא תֶחֱטָא עָלַי, לָא תִסְּבִין פְּגָעַיִךְ מִנִּי, לְעָזְבֵךְ לָשׁוּב מֵאַחֲרָיִךְ, מִכָּל מָקוֹם דַּעְתִּי לְהִתְגַּיֵּר, אֶלָּא מוּטָב עַל יָדֵךְ וְלֹא עַל יְדֵי אַחֶרֶת. כֵּיוָן שֶׁשָּׁמְעָה נָעֳמִי כָּךְ הִתְחִילָה סוֹדֶרֶת לָהּ הִלְכוֹת גֵּרִים, אָמְרָה לָהּ בִּתִּי אֵין דַּרְכָּן שֶׁל בְּנוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל לֵילֵךְ לְבָתֵּי תֵּיאַטְרָאוֹת וּלְבָתֵּי קִרְקָסִיאוֹת שֶׁל גּוֹיִם. אָמְרָה לָהּ, אֶל אֲשֶׁר תֵּלְכִי אֵלֵךְ. אָמְרָה לָהּ בִּתִּי אֵין דַּרְכָּן שֶׁל יִשְׂרָאֵל לָדוּר בְּבַיִת שֶׁאֵין שָׁם מְזוּזָה. אָמְרָה לָהּ, בַּאֲשֶׁר תָּלִינִי אָלִין עַמֵּךְ עַמִּי, אֵלּוּ עֳנָשִׁין וְאַזְהָרוֹת. וֵאלֹהַיִךְ אֱלֹהָי, שְׁאָר מִצְווֹת.</p>\n<p><em>\"And Ruth said: entreat me not to leave you and to return from following you (Ruth 1:16)\"-- what does \"entreat\" [lit. \"hurt\"] mean? <strong>Ruth said to Naomi, \"Do not sin against me by telling me to leave and return from following you. I intend to convert anyway, and it is better that I do it with you than with someone else.\"</strong> When Naomi heard this, she immediately began to lay out before her the laws of conversion. Naomi said, \"My daughter, Jewish women do not go to the non-Jews' theaters and circuses.\" Ruth said, \"Where you go, I will go.\" Naomi said, \"My daughter, Jewish women do not live in a house where there is no mezuzah.\" Ruth said, \"Where you lodge, I will lodge.\" \"Your people shall be my people,\" refers to warning and punishment, and \"Your God shall be my God\" refers to the rest of the commandments.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to answer your question, it would seem that arguably Ruth had gained a great sense of closeness to her mother-in-law which must have in some way conceivably made her committed to not only following her, but also converting. As a princess growing up in the courts of Moav, she knew that she would be entering Eretz Yisroel as an not only an outsider, but a member of a nation that was a proven enemy of the Jewish people! Yet we see, that despite Naomi's exhortations to leave, Ruth had resolved to live in this new reality. To the point where the Malbim, Alshich and Chesed LeMishicho on Rus 1:15-16 all point to the fact the Ruth felt that separating from Naomi and by extension the Torah, was like separating from life itself!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Tradition says she converted for love of Hashem.  But one is allowed to ask: Why didn't she do it before, when she was married to a Jew for 20 years?  Also, let us look at her actual words: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Ruth said [to Naomi], Do not entreat me to leave you, or to keep from following you; for wherever you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; Where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if even death parts me from you. (Ruth 1:16-17)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She does not speak of her love of God, of Israel, of Judaism, or of monotheism. She speaks only of her love of Naomi.  (This point is attributed to Rabbi Samuel ben Isaac de Uçeda of 16th-century Tzfat, Israel, in his commentary on the Book of Ruth, <em>Iggeret Shmuel</em>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While many believe Ruth converted when she said in 1:16, that “your G-d is my G-d,” Gersonides, also known as Ralbag interpreted chapter 1 to be saying that Orpah and Ruth converted to Judaism prior to marrying Mahlon and Chilion, and the proof is that her conversion is not mentioned for Boaz. Naomi even later tested them to see if they have converted. Thus, it seems that Ruth converted out of love of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Ruth said “Your G-d is my G-d” because Naomi said: “Look, your sister-in-law returned to her people and her god; you should return after your sister-in-law.” Ruth answered: “No, I will go where you go and your G-d will be my G-d.” This is another way of saying, “Your land will be my land.” This seems to say that she did it for her love for Naomi.</p>\n\n\n",

Clearly, this is the literal definition of idolatry and thus it is assur to have a statue of the \"Buddha.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is a clear idol, and even if the statue might not have been worshipped, it contains strong Touma (as it was created for the purpose of meditational-worship) and should not be kept at any house and rather destroyed.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are a few different possible problems which much be addressed.\nThe verse (Shemos 20:20) states \"You shall not make [images of what is] with me; gods of silver and gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves\". Based on this verse the Gemara (Rosh Hashana 24b) says that it is prohibited to make any image of man or celestial bodies (sun, moon,or stars). This is a Torah prohibition. The Shulchan Aruch (YD 141:4) rules like this Gemara, that is prohibited to create these images.</p>\n\n<p>The next question is when someone else made these images, and now you own it. May you keep such an image or must you get rid of it? The Gemara(ibid) says that even if someone else made these images you may not keep it as it will lead to \"chashada\" a suspicion. The concern is that others will think you are serving these images. This halacha is a Rabbinic prohibition and is brought as practical halacha in Shulchan Aruch (ibid). </p>\n\n<p>This seems to be precisely our case and as such it would seem be prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>The Chochmas Adam (86:6) says that since this halacha is based on the suspicion that a person is serving these images and since today that is very uncommon, there is no problem to keep an image of a man. (This Chochmas Adam, is one of the reasons that many observant homes have dolls for children to play with). \nHowever the Chochmas Adam says that an image which people do serve even today, there of course would be a prohibition to own. That would certainly be true in this case.\nIt is very important to note that the Chochmas Adam did not permit something the Torah prohibits. The prohibition to create an image of a man is true even today, even if no one serves such images.The Chochmas Adam only permitted the Rabbinic prohibition of keeping such an image, on the basis that the concern that it will appear that you serve the idol is no longer true. \nMany authorities do argue on the Chochmas Adam.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue over is if this statue was used for idol worship, it would be prohibited to benefit from, unless there was nullification by the one who served it.It is possible, but one would have to know the details of how you got it to comment on that.  </p>\n\n\n",

It can’t mean ‘face’ as flesh and blood, and it’s clearly not the same as in those occasions one is speaking face-to-face as it is clear that people like Ya’akov and Moshe for example didn’t die in those occasions. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question can be understood by looking at what the Holy One, blessed be He answers to Moshe in Shemot 33:17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה גַּ֣ם אֶת־הַדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּ֛ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְתָּ אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֑ה כִּֽי־מָצָ֤אתָ חֵן֙ בְּעֵינַ֔י <strong>וָאֵדָעֲךָ֖ בְּשֵֽׁם׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That G-d said He would connect (<em>that the root of וָאֵדָעֲךָ֖ is ידע, like in Adam knew Chava)</em> with Moshe Rabbeinu <em>by way of (His) name</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And this introduces a very important concept from Jewish teaching that we know and connect with G-d by way of His name. This is emphasized by the communal response by many to blessings pronounced aloud by the <em>Shaliach Tzibbur</em>, the communal prayer leader, namely <em>Baruch Hu u'baruch Sh'mo</em> (Blessed is He and His name).</p>\n\n<p>G-d, at His essence and being, transcends the ability of all created and/or emanated things to truly connect in any way. This relates to all creation being to some degree finite, while G-d is infinite.</p>\n\n<p>But G-d makes it possible for His creation to  connect by way of His name, that He and His name are one. This idea is often described in kabbalistic and chassidic teaching with the allegory of a garment which covers its wearer. The garment is compared to His name.</p>\n\n<p>In this particular quotation you reference, it is emphasizing the idea that in Hebrew language, there are many ways to understand and comprehend words and names. One commonly used way is to view words and names in terms of <em>beginning, end</em> and <em>middle</em> (ראש, סוף ותוך).</p>\n\n<p>But in this case, the emphasis is on the <em>internal aspect</em> (called פנימיות or פני) and the <em>external aspect</em> (called חיצוניות or אחור). Discussion of this concept can be found in Sefer Adir B'Marom by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, page 92 and also in the HaGa'ot of Rabbi Moshe Zacuto to Sefer Mevo Sha'arim, note 5.</p>\n\n<p>In Shemot 33:19, G-d explained to Moshe that He would grant Moshe's request and cause all of His <em>good</em> (טוב) to pass before Moshe. And this refers to the <em>external aspect</em> of the name which G-d used to bring about the creation. That name is אהוה, which has a gematria of 17 (טוב) and is hidden within the first sentence of the written Torah (Bereshit 1:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים <strong>אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That the first letters of the words, **אֵ֥\"ת הַ\"שָּׁמַ֖יִם וְ\"אֵ֥ת הָ\"אָֽרֶץ, are the first two and last two letters of that name and are the <em>external aspect</em> or אחור of that complete name. And so G-d was telling Moshe that He would reveal this to Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n<p>But the inner aspect of that name could not be revealed to Moshe because of the decree of death made against Adam and Chava who together as one flesh are known as HaAdam (האדם).</p>\n\n<p>That these inner letters of G-d's name reveal G-d's oneness in His creation. And only when the blemish made by Adam and Chava has been corrected will G-d's oneness truly be revealed within His creation and death  be removed from the world. Until that circumstance, the inner letters of G-d's name, the Yud and Heh, remain apart like is indicated in the words for husband (אי\"ש) and wife (אש\"ה).</p>\n\n<p>But when husband and wife are one flesh, then G-d's oneness, His <em>Shechinah</em>, is revealed like is stated by Rabbi Akiva in Sotah 17a.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that this means that Moshe Rabbeinu is able to perceive (<em>see</em>)in the maximum way that a human being can understand the ways of Hashem. However, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>V.20 gives the reason for not granting the request, because its nature\n  lies beyond the border-line which is drawn as the highest possible\n  attainment of the human mind here on earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The the term <em>panim el panim</em> is the idiom for the highest level a human mind can achieve, while <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9894/showrashi/true#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Sisa 33:20</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(And He said, \"You will not be able to see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Means that it is impossible for the human mind to perceive and understand the essence and meaning of Hashem. An attempt to reach beyond the human limits would destroy a person's mind.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Each occurence of these words ('see', 'panav' and 'achorai') must been understood individually and in context because they have multiple levels of meaning. The Rambam <a href=\"https://www.mosadharavkook.com/shop/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">comments both passages and its wording</a>: according to him, neither the notion of seeing, the notion of face and the back of Hashem are supposed to be understood literally, but metaphorically. </p>\n\n<p>While the verse \"no one can see His panav and live\" the word \"see\" means <strong>\"to comprehend\"</strong> (like one who says \"I see the truth\") and \"panav\" means <strong>His reality as it truly is</strong> (something not subject of intelectual apprehension). The expression \"panim al panim\", in the other hand, means <strong>without intermediators</strong> (whether forms or someone in between) to transmit His communication, such as dreams, visions or angels, etc. </p>\n\n<p>To \"see\" the \"achorai\" of Hashem is meant <strong>comprehend his ways, wills and virtues (from a reflection on His deeds)</strong>, as opposed to his trully being. </p>\n\n<p>In order to understand the meaning of each words, one should check the meaning of each word and its proper contextual meanings. These are the words of Rambam based on his Moreh Nevuchim.</p>\n\n\n",

To me, most of the beginning of Sefer Bamidbar is not intertwined: it is a detailed discussion of how Israel was arranged around the Mishkan. The numbers of each tribe and how they were arranged in degalim, then the same for Levi along with the jobs of each of the parts of Levi (into P' Naso), then the rules of who is not allowed to be in each machaneh, then the presents of the Nesiim to consecrate the Mishkan, then (P' B'haalosecha) the consecration of the Leviim, Korban Pesach and Pesach Sheini before they left, statements that they moved according to the direction of G-d, the trumpets for moving the nation - and then they began to move.<br>\nThat all seems very sensibly arranged to me.<br>\nThe question is, what are those three mitzvos you mentioned doing there? Why are the laws of gezel hager, sotah, and nazir way over here in the middle of this presentation, instead of where I would have thought they would go - say in Parshas Kedoshim?<br>\nRav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch has one interesting attempt at an answer, see there.</p>\n\n<p>Update: There is a very brief comment from the Seforno, Bamidbar 9:1: \"בחדש הראשון אחר שפקד אנשי הצכא וסידר הדגלים ונושאי המשכן להכניסם לארץ וטהר מחניהם מן הטמאים כאמרו והיה מחניך קדוש (דברים כג, טו) ומן הממזרים בענין הסוטה למען תהיה השכינה ביניהם במחנה צבאותם\" - \"after they had purified their camp from tumah, 'Your camp shall be holy', and from mamzerim in the matter of the sotah, that the shechinah could be among them in the camp with their hosts...\"<br>\nNot quite clear why those are the particular mitzvos that are needed for the shechinah, as opposed to the whole rest of Toras Cohanim, but the Seforno seems to be addressing your question directly.</p>\n\n\n",

So I immediately wondered why does it even say \"against thee\"?  ‎‏‏‎Every sin is a sin against God (directly or indirectly), right?  </p>\n\n<p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎We know Chazal extrapolate incredible truths from Tanach once they find a verse that says something seeming to be superfluous. Thinking about them and writing this verse makes me wonder...  ‎‏‏‎Is it necessary to end psalm 119:11 with the words \"against thee\" when it could have just simply said: \"Thy word I have hid in my heart that I might not sin\"‎‏‏‎...</p>\n\n<p>...what is the (extra) meaning of the words \"against thee\"?\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z8nyD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z8nyD.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Many quotations in the book of Psalms use characteristic poetic styles to convey its messages. The psalm you mention uses the <em>Synthetic Parallelism</em> in which the psalmist parallels words/themes/ideas in the first clause with other words/themes/ideas in the second clause, also completing and adding an intended effect of an existed cause in the previous clause.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) \"<strong><em>Your word</em></strong> I have hidden in my heart,\" (cause)</p>\n  \n  <p>b) \"That I might not sin <strong><em>against Thee</em></strong>.\" (effect)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that, in this sense, the expression \"Thy word\" (God's word= His Torah) parallels with \"against Thee\" (God, the One who gave the Torah). It appears that whitout  \"against Thee\" the psalmist wouldn't be able to convey two major things:</p>\n\n<p>1) to be coherent with the poetic style (Synthetic Parallelism) in which he design this and others of his psalms and </p>\n\n<p>2) to express the idea that the his sins which he is talking about is notedly against God (of Whom he mentions on both clauses). Otherwise, withouth these last words would give the impression of talking about the sins in general, as the ones bein adam lechavero.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not being a learned man, I cannot refer to any sources, but I will speculate that these words are polemical and stem from the psalmist’s desire to differentiate himself from surrounding peoples and persons who would affirm - and presumably serve - ‘other gods’. I don’t know much about paganism, but I imagine all the false deities of the world were believed to have placed some demands on their devotees, making possible the idea of sinning against ‘another’ god. I think, in other words, that the psalmist is simply saying that it is Hashem’s Torah, and that alone, that he heeds, rather than any instruction that was said, by those around him, to have come from ‘another’ god. As I say, I am not especially learned, so welcome correction if anyone has better ideas.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Besides the poetic aspect mentioned above, there's an additional implication of the words \"against thee.\"</p>\n\n<p>The basic concept of sin is \"distancing oneself from G-d.\"\nThis is expressed clearly in how do teshuva/repent for sins.</p>\n\n<p>It's not enough to stop doing the act, regret it and resolve not to repeat the bad act.\nWe must verbally confess our sins.\nWhat's the text for the confession?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[How does one confess?] He states: ‘I implore You, G‑d, I sinned, I\n  transgressed, I committed iniquity <strong>before You</strong> by doing the\n  following. Behold, I regret and am embarrassed by my deeds. I promise\n  never to repeat this act again.’”<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4134855/jewish/You-Will-Return-to-the-Lord-Your-G-d-The-Commandment-of-Teshuvah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> (laws of teshuva 1:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, on Yom Kippur, we repeatedly confess our sins and ask for forgiveness.\nOne of the central confessions consists of a list of 42 sins. Each line starts off by saying \nעל חטא שחטאנו <strong>לפניך</strong>...\n\"For the sin that we have sinned <strong>before You</strong>…\nSome of the commentators explain (see the artscroll Yom Kippur machzor, in the back in their interlineated explanation, among other sources) that we don't just confess our sins. We emphasize that it was \"before You.\"\nThat recognition is very important.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because Judaism doesn't just view people by their actions; their intention counts as well.</p>\n\n<p>A person who doesn't believe in G-d, but lights candles every Friday night because it's romantic, doesn't fulfill the mitzvah of lighting Shabbos candles!</p>\n\n<p>The same is true for negative commandments. A person who doesn't steal only because he's afraid of being caught is not fulfilling the mitzvah of not stealing.\nIt's still good not to steal; the person is not doing a negative action of stealing, with all the ramifications involved. But it's not the same as fulfilling the mitzvah of not stealing.</p>\n\n<p>(This is related to the concept of \"mitzvos tzrichos kavana\" a person needs to intend to fulfill a mitzvah while performing it. See <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more) details.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Dovid HaMelech was not just being poetic in the verse.\nHe wants to keep- not a torah, but Your Torah- in his heart. This will prevent him from sinning- not just doing a bad deed, but doing it so \"in front of Hashem.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is really the essence of all the Torah- to build a connection with Hashem through doing the mitzvos. See the first chapter of Mesilas Yesharim for more about this. </p>\n\n\n",

That's a Dochek and certainly doesn't fit with all of the Poskim who actually treat it as more Machmir than Issur.)</p>\n<p>Another side question that bothers me is being that Tzara'as is a spiritual malady that comes from behaving inappropriately (such as by speaking Lashon Harah or being miserly), not a physical one, how can eating fish and meat together cause it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>B”H.  I don’t know if you’ve gotten your answer to this question yet, but I’d like to provide my standpoint on it, and we could discuss it.  From what I can gather, you’re wondering why there is a greater stringency placed upon washing one’s hands between eating fish and meat due to the inherent danger of Tza’aras, and more specifically, why this particular type of Tzaaras is life threatening.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I’d like to direct your focus to a particular point, just because there aren’t any sources that say it was dangerous, doesn’t make it inherently safe.  Far from it.  Just because a malady is spiritual doesn’t mean that it cannot be deadly, and threaten the body as well.  Secondly, the particular Tza’aras you’re referencing is the one mentioned by Rashi.  Given that the illness and particular malady hadn’t been present for thousands of years meant that it must have been extremely rare, for whatever reason; possibly because it was well-understood that this malady was particularly lethal, enough to be mentioned explicitly, as a footnote to the otherwise broad assortment of Tza’aras.  If not lethal, it was definitely rare, given the extremely low frequency of cases of it as mentioned by Rashi.  Thirdly, you mentioned that we have no sources saying it’s dangerous, even though poskim and the Shulchan Aruch themselves label it as such.  We know it was life-threatening, because it was treated as such.  Obviously, the specifics cannot be completely discerned, as this disease has not been identified in anyone today as far as I am aware, and what exactly it was is anyone’s guess at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Given what we are aware of, we can deduce that this skin condition had to have some degree of lethality or danger, coupled with its low frequency.  That’s my explanation for why it was listed as such, so we should both agree that despite a lack of additional sources, it was generally understood to be life-threateningly dangerous for one reason or another.</p>\n\n<p>I’d also like to point out that type of Tza’aras is regarded equally as dangerous for the spirit, as it is for the body.  If anything, this only serves to reinforce my point.  It would definitely have an impact on someone’s Tahara to be afflicted with this condition.</p>\n\n<p>I am deeply sorry that I couldn’t produce any sources for my argument, but I decided to apply some logic to it, in order to try and establish a general understanding of the Tza’aras before either of us can elaborate further.</p>\n\n<p>To give an answer to your other question, though, I think that the general understanding of Tza’aras can be any skin malady, though most often leprosy.  And given that it has both a spiritual aspect to it, and a physical one inherent in the fact that it presents itself on the skin in one form or another, we can infer that it had some physical aspect to it.  I’m certain that other Tza’aras (such as leprosy) could come about naturally within someone.  But in the exact same way, HaShem could afflict someone with it as punishment for Lashon Hara or miserliness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>When asked about the danger of eating fish and meat together, I heard in the name of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzvi_Berkowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Tzvi Berkowitz</a> that it may be similar to a smoking one cigarette where each one is technically dangerous in the sense that it damages one's health. Is one going to be deadly? For the vast majority of people - no. As you increase the number of cigarettes smokes, each one builds onto the next and causes further danger to that individual's life. Similarly, eating fish and meat together may not be an <em>immediate danger</em> for the vast majority of people. </p>\n\n<p>As for the second question, perhaps transgressing the words of the Rabanan in Pesachim (76b) warrant tzara'as. Similar to Rav Dovid Zvi Hoffman's <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/reasons-behind-tzaraat-and-other-forms-tuma\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">words</a> in Vayikra (p. 220)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Tzara'at does not generate tum'a because it results from the sin [for\n  this is not always the case; other illnesses also result from various\n  sins but do not generate tum'a]. Rather, tzara'at generates tum'a\n  because the outward appearance of the disease is the symbolic image of\n  the sinner.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Someone who doesn't care about a concern the Rabanan decreed on the nation would seem to be lacking something from within which warrants the projected image of tzara'as. (Not getting into whether nature has changed nowadays since you are only asking the questions according to the opinions who say this danger is still going strong.)  Alternatively, if we understand the issue is one of danger, then perhaps the tzara'as would also be warranted for those who transgress the command to protect their life - וְנִשְׁמַרְתֶּם מְאֹד לְנַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶם (Devarim 4:15). Along the lines of, 'If you don't care about your health with meat/fish, then I'll give you dangerous tzara'as to see if you wake up to protect your health or continue not caring. </p>\n\n<p>An additional point to consider is the scientific findings <a href=\"https://library.yctorah.org/files/2016/09/Mixing-Fish-and-Meat-Fish-and-Dairy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>stearic acid found in beef and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and\n  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) found in fish have been found to \n  exacerbate  psoriasis. We  also  see  that  omega-3  fatty  acids \n  from  fish enhance  TNFalpha  which  is  also  implicated  in \n  psoriasis. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some point to parallels between tzara'as and psoriasis, a skin disorder which <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/qa/can-severe-psoriasis-be-dangerous\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">can be</a> dangerous in rare circumstances. (I don't know how those opinions explain that it spreads to clothing and the house...)</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Metzora.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma (Metzora 4)</a> brings a list of aveiros which can bring about tzara'as, including chillul Hashem, stealing, instigating arguments between brothers, etc. Since causing harm to our body is 'stealing' in a sense from the One Who lent us our body, it may warrant tzara'as as well.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should we prevent a chumra in the laws of Shabbos that exceeds the normal understanding?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>halacha</em> is that generally a <em>keli shelishi</em> does not cause <em>bishul</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish says that a  <em>keli shelishi</em> (or revii) above <em>yad soledes bo</em> does cook those things that are <em>kalei habishul</em>. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/cookshabbat/06cookshabbat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shiur by Rav Yosef Zvi Rimon</a> explains the lenient view </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rashi (Shabbos 39a, s.v. De-sharei) explains that since we are not\n  accustomed to cook in the sun there is no prohibition of <em>bishul</em> in\n  the sun.</p>\n  \n  <p>For our issue, it may be that the focus of the distinction between\n  <em>keli [sheini]</em> and <em>keli shelishi</em> is the common custom.  Most foods we cook in a <em>keli rishon</em>; some foods, such as tea, coffee, baby\n  formula, etc., are commonly cooked in a <em>keli [sheini]</em>; while in a\n  <em>keli shelishi</em>, one is not accustomed to cook at all.  Naturally, we may say that even if on a practical level the foods that would cook in\n  a <em>keli [sheini]</em> would also cook in a <em>keli shelishi</em>, there is no\n  prohibition to cook them in a <em>keli shelishi</em>, because this is not\n  <em>derekh bishul</em>, and it does not fall within the boundaries of the melakha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So here we see that to transgress the issur of <em>bishul</em> on Shabbos, it is critical that the process is <em>derekh bishul</em> even though the food may be cooked in the <em>keli shelishi</em>. (I mean that the constitution of the food may be changed by being immersed in a  <em>keli shelishi</em> which can easily be well over <em>yad soledes bo</em>.) Or to put it in other words, <em>bishul</em> is not cooking. </p>\n\n<p>Someone observed cooking going on in a <em>keli shelishi</em> and wants to be extra strict and will not add anything to a <em>keli shelishi</em> which is above <em>yad soledes bo</em>. </p>\n\n<p>How should we view such conduct?

After the woman is beyond child-bearing age, she converts at that point.\nThe whole thing is kept a secret; no one realizes that the \"convert\" was actually a non-Jewish shifcha the whole time!</p>\n<p>The dayan mentioned that there's a machlokes between gedolim (he mentioned Rav Aharon Kotler, Rav Moshe Feinstein, the Satmar Rav and \"others\") about how to create the \"shifcha\" status.\nThe issue is- since nowadays in Western society slavery is outlawed, there is no way to actually \"buy\" a slave since the sale would be void.</p>\n<p>According to some poskim the couple would need to travel to a country which actually allows slavery (like many African or S.E. Asian countries) and live there.\nOthers held it was enough for the marriage to take place in that foreign country, and then afterwards return to the US (or other western country without slavery). (Even though the sale becomes void when they return to the US, once the sale was valid the woman became a \"slave.\" Even though the US will negate his ownership of her, she still remains halachically a slave.)</p>\n<p>Apparently today, it's done by entering the Embassy of such a country.

The verse on the basis of which the eighth foundation is attested is his [i.e. Moses'] saying, \"By this shall you know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things.\"  (Bamidbar 16:28)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Translation from Kellner, Menachem (1986), Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought, pp. 14-1 5)</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering what the bolded phrase mean. Does this mean that if we consider the 13 principles of faith halachically binding someone who disagrees with the Rambam regarding the form of these mitzvot such as Rashi who says you only should have one techelet string on each corner of a four cornered garment while the Rambam says two, is considered a heretic or are we to believe that statement to mean that the final halachic decision perforce is the one that was told by God to Moses? This question is further complicated by the fact that there are many customs regarding how the tzitzit are made.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>דברי תורה עניים במקום אחד ועשירים במקום אחר. The Rambam himself, elsewhere in his writings (specifically in his Introduction to the Mishnah), carefully distinguishes between the details given to Moshe at Sinai, which are universally accepted, and the details that were derived using human analysis, some of which are subject to debate. He thus <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hakdama/3-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המשנה, שהיא כוללת פירוש כל המצות הכתובות בתורה. מהם קבלות מקובלות מפי משה ע\"ה. ומהם דעות הוציאום בדרך הסברה ואין עליהם מחלוקת. ומהם דעות שנפלה בהם מחלוקת בין שתי הסברות...</p>\n<p>וזה עיקר יש לך לעמוד על סודו. והוא, שהפירושים המקובלים מפי משה, אין מחלוקת בהם בשום פנים, שהרי מאז ועד עתה לא מצאנו מחלוקת נפלה בזמן מן הזמנים, מימות משה ועד רב אשי בין החכמים, כדי שיאמר אחד, המוציא עין חברו יוציאו את עינו, שנאמר עין בעין, ויאמר השני, אינו אלא כופר בלבד שחייב לתת...</p>\n<p>אבל מי שיחשוב שהדינים שנחלקים בהם כמו כן מקובלים מפי משה, וחושבים שנפלה המחלוקת כדרך טעות ההלכות, או השכחה, או מפני שאחד מהם קיבל קבלת אמת והשני טעה בקבלתו... זה הדבר מגונה מאוד, והוא דברי מי שאין לו שכל ואין בידו עיקרים, ופוגם באנשים אשר נתקבלו מהם המצות, וכל זה שווא ובטל.</p>\n<p>...the Mishnah, which contains the explanations of all of the mitzvos written in the Torah. Some of these are explanations received from Moshe o.b.m., some were derived by logical analysis and are not debated, and still others are subject to debate...</p>\n<p>You must be aware of the following subtle point: the explanations received from Moshe are not subject to debate. Never, from his time until now, was there ever any debate among the sages - from Moshe through Rav Ashi - where one claims that if A puts out B's eye, then they should put out A's eye (since it says \"an eye for an eye\") while another says it means just a monetary payment... (and continues with several other such examples).</p>\n<p>Now, anyone who thinks that the debated laws were also received from Moshe, and believe that they became debatable because of mistakes in deciding the halachah, or forgetfulness, or because one learned the correct version and the other learned a mistaken one... - this is an abhorrent view, and would be held only by someone who has no intelligence and no basic principles. Such a person insults the people from whom we received the [explanations of] the mitzvos. The entire idea is baseless and worthless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, earlier in the same introduction the Rambam speaks of sukkah (the first example in the Eighth Principle), noting how its various details were given to Moshe and then transmitted throughout the generations to us.</p>\n<p>Applying this to your question, then, \"the form of Sukka, the Lulav, the Shofar, the Tzitzit, the Tefillin... are the actual forms which G-d told to Moses\" - i.e., the basic parameters of each of these mitzvos that were never subject to dispute among the sages. They all universally agree, for example, that there is a mitzvah to take the lulav with the other species (not as the Karaites, for example, claimed, that the relevant verse is simply telling us to use these species to build the sukkah), and what the identities of those species are, and so forth. Likewise, they all agree that a shofar is a horn of an animal, and that it has to be blown in a certain series of sounds on Rosh Hashanah. That there are disputes about the finer details - what's the minimum size of an esrog? What exact sounds constitute a teruah? - doesn't contradict that principle, because the very fact that those details are debated shows that they were originally arrived at by human analysis rather than by transmission from Hashem to Moshe to us.</p>\n\n\n",

The categories don't even match.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud uses a prayer during pregnancy for a child to be male as an example of an inappropriate prayer because the gender is already determined. It also uses the birth of a son as an example of how you could hear good news in parallel to hearing that rain fell on your field. If you don't know if something is going to turn out the way you want it or the other way, then when you hear the good news you thank God. The Talmud takes for granted that having the fetus come out having always been unfortunately female was not the news you wanted. This example was not brought by the Rif or Rambam, and multiple Rishonim note that it was not generally put into practice. It is mentioned in the Tur and Shulchan Aruch, though on the spot the Rama notes that we're not talking about a formal obligation and most aren't careful about this, so the rule is definitely not anything like \"when a halakhically male child moves X tefachim down from a uterus the biological parent must recite these 8 words within Y minutes and Z chalakim\".</p>\n\n<p>The other half of your question is the blessing celebrating seeing a friend you haven't seen in 30 days. The Shulchan Aruch rules that this is only where you have seen them before and now see them again. Some recent authorities though have argued that seeing a close family member for the first time is no less exciting than that and also warrants a blessing. If you accept that position, which is hotly debated, you can say a blessing on seeing the child for the first time if it's indeed super exciting. If you said a different blessing on hearing the child's gender, as above, then maybe you wouldn't feel inspired to bless God again on seeing the child, or maybe you wouldn't feel as emotionally pressured to rely on the opinions that a first time sighting counts in order to vent your inner joy. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=722&pgnum=80\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Some</a> hold not like you cited that you would still say a blessing on seeing the child. (There is a large amount of discussion among modern rabbis how to handle various permutations with twins on this point.) This entire obligation is as noted somewhat novel so this could also just be one reason to reject it.</p>\n\n<p>But neither of these has anything to do with birth <em>per se</em>, since the child isn't more valuable to your estate <em>ex utero</em> than <em>in utero</em> (and for a few years at least probably the opposite is true) and you can see the child for the first time at any age.</p>\n\n<p>You're comparing a gender-news blessing with a seeing-a-friendly-face blessing and wondering why they aren't the same birth blessing. The categories don't even match.</p>\n\n\n",

That seems reasonable enough.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the Torah verses for the three sections: Exo 15:18, Num 23:21, Deu 33:5; Gen 8:1, Exo 2:24, [Exo 6:5 / Lev 26:42]; Exo 19:16, Exo 19:19, Exo 20:15.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the verses from the Prophets: Isa 44:6, Ova 1:21, Zek 14:9; Jer 2:2, Eze 16:60, Jer 31:19; Isa 18:3, Isa 27:13, Zek 9:14-15</p>\n\n<p>Everything there is in order (except the one exception for which we already got a reason).</p>\n\n<p>But here are the verses from Psalms: 22:29, 93:1, [146:10,] 24:7-10; 111:4-5, [105:8,] 106:45; 47:6, 98:6, 81:4[-5], 150:1-6</p>\n\n<p>Those aren't at all in order. Why don't we prefer to put the verses from Psalms in order in each section?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why recite the Psalms verses <strong>out of order</strong> ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, write them <strong>in order</strong> first, and then notice that, in <strong>each</strong> case, a <strong>small</strong> modification helps make <strong>more</strong> sense of the text; thus,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>22:29</strong> For the kingdom is the LORD'S; and He is the ruler over the nations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>24:7-10</strong> Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. 'Who is the King of glory?' 'The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.' Lift up your heads, O ye gates, yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. 'Who then is the King of glory?' 'The LORD of hosts; He is the King of glory.' Selah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>93:1</strong> The LORD reigneth; He is clothed in majesty; the LORD is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength; yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice how the beginning of 93:1 <em>(“The LORD reigneth”)</em> echoes the same ideas as those reflected in 22:29 <em>(“the kingdom is the LORD'S”</em> and <em>“He is the ruler over the nations”)</em>, while, at the same time, the ones immediately following <em>(“He is clothed in majesty”</em> and <em>“He hath girded Himself with strength”)</em> mirror those mentioned in 24:7-10 <em>(“King of glory”</em> and <em>“the LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle”)</em>. As such, it would make more sense to have 93:1 placed between the other two passages, rather than after them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Similarly for</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>106:45</strong> <strong>And</strong> He remembered for them His covenant, <strong>and</strong> repented according to the multitude of His mercies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>111:4</strong> He hath made a memorial for His wonderful works; the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It makes more sense to have conjunctions, such as <em>and</em>, which help string up consecutive sentences into a single phrase, placed towards the end of the enumeration, rather than at the beginning; i.e., <em>“X, Y, and Z”</em> instead of <em>“and A, B, C”</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Lastly,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>47:6</strong> God is gone up amidst shouting, <strong>the LORD</strong> amidst the sound of the horn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>81:4</strong> Blow the horn at the new moon, at the full moon for our feast-day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>98:6</strong> With trumpets and sound of the horn shout ye before <strong>the King, the LORD</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>150:1-6</strong> Hallelujah. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the firmament of His power. Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His abundant greatness. Praise Him with the blast of the horn; praise Him with the psaltery and harp. Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and the pipe. Praise Him with the loud-sounding cymbals; praise Him with the clanging cymbals. Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Hallelujah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though not present in the selection itself, the verses immediately succeeding 47:6 make explicit mention of God's kingship, and of His royal throne, whereas both themes are completely absent from Psalm 81 in its entirety; as such, it would make more sense to move 98:6 closer to 47:6, since both passages exhibit similar patterns of thought and expression.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do we utilize the Rambam as a halachic authority while simultaneously shun some of his beliefs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the outset of this question I would like to make it clear that I'm not taking sides on whether we should or should not believe the Rambam's (or others) statements. I am talking about contemporary Orthodox Judaism as whole. It seems to me that there are a number fairly extreme \"issues\" that general contemporary Orthodoxy has with the Rambam, which include but are not limited to his seeming disdain for all things metaphysical(i.e. segulot, amulets, magic etc.), but at the end of day a large portion of our current halachic reality is based on the Rambam's opinions. My question is how do we deal with this dissonance\n? It gives the appearance of \"picking and choosing\" which is not the Jewish way as far as I know. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <em>In those days, the attitude of philosophers was not to intertwine philosophy with obedience to the law. Therefore, there was never a need to disavow the non-philosophical works.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, when someone makes a philosophical statement that doesn't fit with the common narrative, he is labeled a heretic and his teachings  are banned. In the old days, given the same situation, the works in question were labeled heretical and banned if deemed necessary, while the other works were addressed for what they were.</p>\n\n<p>Why? There was an assumption of decency of character where philosophical ideas did not permeate the writer to the extent that every idea he had was influenced by his philosophy. So his understanding of the laws of Shabbos from the Talmud per say, were not influenced by his understanding of the nature of witchcraft, for example. </p>\n\n<p>What changed? Well, the Rambam while opining the ridiculousness of brief in witchcraft, still never said and therefore the laws concerning witchcraft are null and void. An attitude such as this shows his respect for the Torah and its laws.</p>\n\n<p>In the pre-modern era, it became commonplace for many thinkers to point to things they believed were proven wrong or obviously incorrect, and used that to obviate mitzvos. In many situations that attitude spread even to mitzvos that had nothing to do with the subject at hand.\nThat is why bans on people, rather than particular works, became popular. </p>\n\n<p>We cannot use the standards of the modern era, to ban people, and wonder why those standards weren't used in previous times when attitudes from all camps were different.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that the article linked to is rather exaggerated - not so much in its portrayal of the Rambam but more in its description of today's consensus.</p>\n\n<p>While it is undeniable that commonly accepted mystical cliches may have made the Rambam turn green, the extent to which people take these (essentially empty) statements is severely exaggerated. Most of us are rationalists even if we may deny it - when we are ill we go to the doctor (rather than just davening or getting a brocho), we don't pay any attention to astrology and we don't just rely on Hashem to feed us. Most of those who go in pilgrimages to Meron and such like do it for the experience and not because they genuinely think that this is an expression of Avodas Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>If anything, it is in halacha that we follow the Rambam least.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does Reform Judaism regard converts who leave Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've come to understand over time that if an Orthodox convert leaves Judaism/stops practicing all or some of Judaism, the status of their Jewish identity is decided on a case-by-case basis by the rabbinate. In some cases, it may be decided that the person is still Jewish while in others the person's conversion is revoked altogether.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, according to Reform Judaism, what is the status of such an individual (one who has completed a Reform conversion)? Is it also case-by-case or is there a sweeping consensus?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I've found an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.jta.org/2014/10/06/united-states/10-questions-about-jewish-conversion-you-want-to-know-but-are-afraid-to-ask-1/amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> that refers to the matter. However, I found the Reform rabbi's answer to be ambiguous and open to interpretation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If a Jew leaves Judaism by adopting another religion, that individual is regarded as outside the boundaries of the Jewish community,\" says Rabbi Stephen Einstein, co-chair of the Commission on Outreach, Membership, and Sacred Community of the Union for Reform Judaism and Central Conference of American Rabbis. \"Of course, s/he could choose at a later time to return.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>a. Does being outside the boundaries of the Jewish community mean being not Jewish or merely being a heretical Jew? b. Choosing to return - does that mean through doing teshuvah or by converting once more? And if the latter, can this be done an endless number of times or is there a limit?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps someone could clarify?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Finally, I decided to send in the question on the Q&A section in ReformJudaism.org.

It’s not unusual for one’s religious observances to change over time – for a person to stop practicing certain elements of the tradition.   However, if one converts to another religion, then they are no longer Jewish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I followed with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would an ex-convert (that is, someone who converted to Judaism and then converted to a different religion, who is then no longer considered Jewish) be allowed to convert once more if they so wish (and are deemed honest in their wishes)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which she answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think so, yes.

Until the sun sets. Rabbi Ya’akov says: Until traffic in the marketplace ceases. And the Rabbis say: Until the time of sleep. And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Ya’akov that if one removed them to go out to the bathroom or to enter the bathhouse and the sun set, one does not don them again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tefillin%2C_Mezuzah_and_the_Torah_Scroll.4.25\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Stam 4:25</a>) brings down this idea and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמְרוּ עָלָיו עַל רַב תַּלְמִידוֹ שֶׁל רַבֵּנוּ הַקָּדוֹשׁ שֶׁכָּל יָמָיו לֹא רָאוּהוּ שֶׁהָלַךְ אַרְבַּע אַמּוֹת בְּלֹא תּוֹרָה אוֹ בְּלֹא צִיצִית אוֹ בְּלֹא תְּפִלִּין:</p>\n<p>It is said of Rav, the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sources for not wearing Tefillin all day</strong></p>\n<p>However, wearing Tefillin all day appears that this was not necessarily the case even for some of Chazal (let alone the majority of the population). In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.14a.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Berachos 14a</a> we see:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' ינאי היה לובשן אחר חולייו ג' ימים לומר שהחולי ממרק מה טעם (תהילים ק״ג:ג׳) הסולח לכל עוניכי הרופא לכל תחלואיכי רבן יוחנן בן זכאי לא הוון תפילוי זעין מיניה לא בקייטא ולא בסיתוא וכך נהג ר' אליעזר תלמידו אחריו ר' יוחנן בסיתוא דהוה חזיק רישיה הוה לביש תרויהון ברם בקייטא דלא הוה חזיק רישיה לא הוה לביש אלא דאדרעיה.</p>\n<p>R' Yannai would wear tefillin three days after recovering from an illness, because an illness purges [one of sin]. Why? \"He forgives all your sins, heals all your diseases.\" (Tehillim 103:3). Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai wouldn't remove his arm tefillin in the summer or the winter. In the winter, when R' Yochanan would [wrap his turban], he would wear both Tefillin. However, in the summer, when R' Yochanan was not [wrap his turban, because of the heat (Pnei Moshe on Yerushalmi)], he would only wear the arm Tefillin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see that R' Yannai seems to only have worn Tefillin after a recovery, and R' Yochanan and R' Yochanan ben Zakkai would at least sometimes only wear the shel yad. The above only applied to Chazal themselves, what about the rest of the population?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.49a.6?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos on Shabbos 49a</a> brings in (via the story of Elisha Ba'al Knafayim) two big reasons why Tefillin was treatly lightly during Chazal and even now. (1) Because they couldn't maintain a clean guf enough to constantly wear them and (2) There were deceivers that would wear tefillin all day only because they wanted to be considered upright so that they could then deceive people.</p>\n<p>Tosfos brings a Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.130a.14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 130a</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא רבי שמעון בן אלעזר אומר כל מצוה שמסרו ישראל עצמן עליהם למיתה בשעת גזרת המלכות כגון עבודה זרה ומילה עדיין היא מוחזקת בידם וכל מצוה שלא מסרו ישראל עצמן עליה למיתה בשעת גזרת המלכות כגון תפילין עדיין היא מרופה בידם</p>\n<p><strong>It was taught in</strong> a <em>baraita</em> that <strong>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</strong> says in praise of the observance of the mitzva of circumcision: <strong>Any mitzva for which the Jews sacrificed their lives at the time of the decrees of the</strong> wicked <strong>empire, such as</strong> the prohibition of <strong>idolatry and</strong> the mitzva of <strong>circumcision, is still steadfastly observed. And any mitzva for which the Jews did not sacrifice their lives at the time of the decrees of the</strong> wicked <strong>empire, such as phylacteries, is still casually observed</strong>, meaning that they are not as careful in its fulfillment as they should be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where he mentions that the mitzvah was \"רפויה בידם\" as we see from that source, in addition to that which was on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.17a\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 17a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פושעי ישראל בגופן מאי ניהו אמר רב קרקפתא דלא מנח תפלין פושעי אומות העולם בגופן אמר רב בעבירה</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: <strong>The rebellious Jews</strong> who have sinned <strong>with their bodies, who are they? Rav said:</strong> This is referring to <strong>the skull that did not</strong> ever <strong>don phylacteries.</strong> The Gemara asks further: <strong>The rebellious</strong> ones <strong>of the nations of the world</strong> who sin <strong>with their bodies</strong>, who are they? <strong>Rav said</strong>: They are those who engage <strong>in the sin</strong>, i.e., forbidden sexual relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(And he brings in a Midrash Shocher Tov to show the deceivers that would abuse their superficiality)</p>\n<p>Based on all of the above, it would seem to be that it was possible there was likely many Chachomim wearing Tefillin (but not all), and much less of the general population because of Tosfos' two reasons.</p>\n<p>L'halachah, the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.37.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 37:2</a>) discusses the mitzvah during the day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצותן להיותם עליו כל היום אבל מפני שצריכי' גוף נקי שלא יפיח בהם ושלא יסיח דעתו מהם ואין כל אדם יכול ליזהר בהם נהגו שלא להניחם כל היום ומ\"מ צריך כל אדם ליזהר בהם להיותם עליו בשעת ק\"ש ותפלה:</p>\n<p>It is a Mitzvah to have them [tefillin] on all day, but because they [tefillin] need a clean body [meaning that] he does not pass gas, and [further require] that one not distract his mind from them, and not every person is able to be careful with them, the practice is not to wear them all day. Nevertheless everyone needs to be careful with them when they are on during the reciting of Shema and Tefilah [aka Shemoneh Esreh] [because we concentrate on holy things at those times anyway].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.37.2?lang=bi&with=Biur%20Halacha&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Biur Halachah brings the Pri Megadim</a> about whether the Torah itself requires is to be wearing Tefillin all day or not, and even talks about the idea of even wearing just the Shel Yad (like we said by R' Yochanan), that I think says some nice things regarding what we said above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עיין בפמ\"ג שמסתפק אם מן התורה חייב כל היום או מן התורה די ברגע אחד שמניח ומדרבנן כל היום ובטלוה עכשיו שאין לנו גוף נקי ומסיק דעיקרן של דברים דאם לא הניח יום א' כלל לתפילין ביטל מ\"ע ובהניח רגע עליו קיים המצוה אבל מצוה מן המובחר מן התורה להיותן עליו כל היום וכו' עיין שם. ובספר ישועות יעקב פסק דמן התורה מצותן כל היום עיין שם.</p>\n<p>See in the Pri Megadim, where he is uncertain about whether wearing Tefillin all day is an obligation from the Torah, or if it's just enough for just a moment, and that it's d'rabbanan during the whole day since now we don't have a guf naki. He concludes that one can fulfill the mitzvah by just wearing them for a moment. The sefer Yeshuas Yaakov says that it's an actual mitzvah from the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Whether Tefillin are noticeable</strong></p>\n<p>While I don't know what was worn pre-Talmudic times, it is commonly understood that in Talmudic times (as in Bavel) and for many centuries later, the common practice was to wear robes and a turban (for example, I've seen Egyptian pictures from pre-Talmudic times, that show people wearing things like sock hats). It would seem that according to the clothing of the time, the Tefillin may commonly have been covered, both on the head and the arm (that is, as we saw in the case of R' Yochanan, above, who would only wear the shel yad in the summer. Presumably, he would not have worn his Tefillin over his turban because of chatzitzah).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>It appears to me that it's possible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Jewish people were not always wearing Tefillin (or even just the shel yad Tefillin) necessarily all of the time</li>\n<li>The clothing and way the Tefillin were worn could very easily have covered them up if they were in fact being worn all of the time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>P.S. This is what I found. I'm hoping that if I made any mistakes, I can be corrected, and that this can be a catalyst for some more discussion and bringing down of some more sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm going to answer your question using the archeological record.

I'm just pointing out that the absence of tefillin in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible#Nach\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nakh</a> may be related to their absence in the archaeological record.</p>\n<p>There are several conclusions that could be drawn from this. Perhaps tefillin could only be afforded by the elite of Israel/Judah and therefore there were very few around during the time of Nakh. Perhaps they are less likely to survive in archaeology when compared to things like stone idols or potsherds since they are made of leather. Or perhaps tefillin was a custom the Rabbinic Jews took upon themselves in Babylon and brought back with them to Israel. As of right now neither Nakh nor the archaeological record can give us a concrete answer for their absence, but their absence in Nakh <em><strong>and</strong></em> archaeology definitely says something.</p>\n\n\n",

If we are to say that the reason for us following Beis Hillel is by dint of the fact that they were the majority, then this shift doesn't make sense, I can't imagine that when Moshiach comes, Beis Shammai will suddenly outnumber Beis Hillel.

Hood also mentions the failure to prove Andersen's assertion, noting that his translation violates some known grammatical and syntactical rules, as the word “LO” lacks the usual Hebrew interrogative particle, and more patently the construction makes the meaning of the verses even more difficult to determine.</p>\n<p>He quotes <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1579107311\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

It can be translated as \"and so,\" \"therefore,\" or \"then.\" In this case, \"v'shmi\" might be interpreted as \"and as a result, my name\" or \"and so, my name.\" It suggests a causal relationship between the previous statement and the mention of the name.</p>\n<p>While the Masoretic Text consistently includes the shva where \"ושמי\" was found in this verse, we cannot definitively say whether it was meant to be u'shemi. The absence of a vowel point marking system in the original written Hebrew language indicates a high probability that v'shmi (וְשְׁמִ֣י) could have and should have been the more accurate option when converting from the non-vowel point writing style.</p>\n<p>The phrase \"ושמי\" (v'shmi), appears numerous times throughout the Hebrew Bible. This word has traditionally been translated to mean “and my name”. However, Its meaning can vary depending on the specific context, encompassing ideas such as invoking God's name, His presence, authority, holiness, and His reputation such as His reputation toward keeping the promises of His word.</p>\n<p>Here are a few notable examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 12:8</strong>  \"From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.

Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.\"\nמזבח אדמה תעשה לי וזבחת עליו עולותיך ושלמיך צאנך ובקרך בכל המקום אשר אזכיר את שמי אבוא אליך וברכתיך\nHere, \"שמי\" (shmi) - “My name”; signifies the presence and honor of God associated with a specific location, often a sanctuary or altar.</p>\n<p><strong>Exodus 23:21</strong> \"Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him.\"\nהשמר מפניו ושמע בקלו אל תמר בו כי לא ישא לפשעכם כי שמי בקרבו\nIn this verse, \"שמי\" (shmi) - “my name”; represents God's authority and presence within His appointed representative, in this case, an angel.</p>\n<p><strong>Leviticus 22:32</strong> \"Do not profane my holy name.

I am the LORD, who makes you holy.\"\nולא תחללו את־שם קדשי ונקדשתי בתוך בני ישראל אני יהוה מקדשכם\nHere, \"שם\" (shem) - “the name”; emphasizes the sanctity and holiness of God's name, which must be respected and upheld by His people.</p>\n<p><strong>Ezekiel 36:23</strong> \"I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them.

The Israelites finally saw the results of YHWH's Almighty hand in use against the false gods of Egypt.</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFOMATION:</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few examples of consecutive shvas in Hebrew, although they are indeed less common. Here are some instances where this occurs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shva Nach (Silent Shva) Followed by Shva Na (Mobile Shva):</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In certain grammatical constructions, a silent shva (shva nach) can be followed by a mobile shva (shva na), which is then pronounced. This happens when the first shva is under a guttural letter (א, ה, ח, ע) and the second is under a non-guttural letter.</p>\n<p>Example: יִשְׁמָ֑עוּ (yishma'u) - \"they will hear\" (Genesis 3:8) - The shva under the shin (ש) is silent, while the one under the mem (מ) is pronounced.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Two Shvas at the End of a Word:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When two shvas occur at the end of a word, both are typically silent. This is common in certain verb forms and feminine nouns.</p>\n<p>Example: אִ֑שְׁתְּ (ishte) - \"woman\" (Genesis 2:23) - Both shvas are silent.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Two Shvas within a Word (Rare):</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In rare cases, two consecutive shvas can appear within a word, usually due to specific grammatical rules or for emphasis. These instances are often found in poetic or archaic texts.</p>\n<p>Example: רַעְמְסֵס (Ra'amses) - a place name (Exodus 1:11) - The shva under the mem (מ) is silent, while the one under the sin (ס) is pronounced.\nApplying to Exodus 6:3:</p>\n<p>While these examples demonstrate the existence of consecutive shvas in Hebrew, their relevance to Exodus 6:3 depends on how we interpret the vav (ו) in \"ושמי.\"</p>\n<p>If we assume the Masoretic vocalization of \"u'shemi\" (with the shva), then the presence of two shvas is not an issue, as the first shva is silent.\nHowever, if we opt for the alternative \"v'shmi\" (without the shva), the presence of two consecutive mobile shvas becomes relevant. While uncommon, it's not impossible, and could be argued as a unique case for emphasis or stylistic reasons.\nUltimately, the decision to accept the \"v'shmi\" reading and its resulting consecutive shvas depends on weighing various factors, including grammatical conventions, textual evidence, and the overall interpretation of the verse. The examples provided here demonstrate that such a sequence is not unprecedented in Hebrew, even if it is less frequent.</p>\n\n\n",

The place of <em>dagesh</em> doesn't determine the accented syllable. If you check the famous verse from Chana's story (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a02.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samuel I 2:1</a>), it contains a similar verb from the <em>hitpael</em> group:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וַתִּתְפַּלֵּ֤ל</strong> חַנָּה֙ וַתֹּאמַ֔ר עָלַ֤ץ לִבִּי֙ בַּֽיהוָ֔ה רָ֥מָה קַרְנִ֖י בַּֽיהוָ֑ה רָ֤חַב פִּי֙ עַל־א֣וֹיְבַ֔י כִּ֥י שָׂמַ֖חְתִּי בִּישֽׁוּעָתֶֽךָ׃</p>\n<p><strong>And</strong> Hannah <strong>prayed</strong>, and said: my heart exulteth in <em>Hashem,</em> my horn is exalted in <em>Hashem;</em> my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in Thy salvation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The cantillation sign (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahpach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mahpach</a>) indicates the accented syllable, which is in this case the last syllable (so it's <em>milra</em>). The same is true for the mentioned words in the <em>kaddish.</em></p>\n<p>(See also the particular word in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c3411.htm#37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 11:37</a>)</p>\n<p>Regarding why certain people put the stress on the (grammatically) wrong syllable, I assume that this is the effect of the local languages that non-Jews spoke. In contrast with Hebrew, having mostly ultimate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)#Non-phonemic_stress\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">stress</a>, German and Hungarian typically have the stress on the first syllable, while in Romance languages and Polish usually the penultimate syllable has the stress. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/14850/joel-k\">JoelK</a> kindly linked <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/18529/15256\">other suggested reasons</a>, but personally I don't find them convincing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's worth noting that Kaddish is Aramaic and not Hebrew. So while there will be some very obvious parallels one shouldn't go overboard applying Hebrew grammatical rules to it.</p>\n<p>If someone wants to know the correct emphasis when saying Kaddish it would make sense to follow the communities who kept Aramaic alive as either a living oral language, or a living religious textual language.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Kurdistan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kurdish Jews</a> continued to speak Aramaic to this day (often called Kurdish, or Neo Assyrian aramaic). You can find some recordings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Yemenite Jews continue to use Aramaic as a religious textual language. They maintain a living tradition of reciting Aramaic targum for their Torah and Haftarah readings. You can find some recordings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%97%20%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>For what it's worth I took an aramaic class at UCLA and was taught that Aramaic like Hebrew usually has a emphasis on the end of the word, but that there were generally more exceptions to this rule than Hebrew has. Also Sepharadim (such as Kurds) and Yemenites are usually a lot more precise on \"secondary emphasis.\" Which is where you stress another syllable almost as much as the actual stressed syllable.So if you hear a recording where it sounds like 2 syllables are being emphasized, this is usually why.</p>\n\n\n",

Included in this instruction is also the command to slay infants and sucklings.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15844/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samuel 15:3</a>\n\"Now, go, and you shall smite Amalek, and you shall utterly destroy all that is his, and you shall not have pity on him: and you shall slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.' \"</p>\n\n<p>We are dealing with two moral issues regarding this instruction:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Accountability of babies over the sins of their parents/nation</li>\n<li>Accountability of babies despite their lack of intellectual capacity to understand sin</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Not only are we speaking of sins these children are not to blame for, EVEN if they had sinned we would surely look at it differently than if a grown adult had sinned and therefore hold them to different standards.\nIn <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16116/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezekiel 18:20</a> God even seems to disavow the idea of inheritance of sin and the liability of a son over his father's wrongdoings. </p>\n\n<p>How does Judaism resolve this moral dilemma? This surely does not sink well with 21st century ethical standards, nor is it very fitting with the aforementioned verse in Ezekiel.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think your question is based on an inaccurate assumption.\nYou are assuming that these Amalekite children are being killed-punished- for the sins of their ancestors.\nThat's not 100% correct.</p>\n<p>In Judaism, suffering can come for multiple reasons. These reasons can be categorized loosely into two categories: Past and Future.</p>\n<p>For a great introduction and explanation of this topic, see \"The Informed Soul\" by Rabbi Dr. Dovid Gottlieb, pg. 128-156, where he brings 12 different explanations for suffering which are offered in classical Jewish sources and explains them in relation to the past or future.</p>\n<p>One practical upshot is that it's possible for someone to suffer even if his past doesn't justify it. There can be other factors which do justify it. And these future factors can even outweigh and override what was earned in the past.</p>\n<p>One example he gives, just to explain this concept:\nImagine hiring Bob to work for you. When payday comes, you need to pay him based on the work he did.</p>\n<p>Imagine that as you are getting ready to give him his check, you get a call from his social worker telling you that they have 100% confirmed that Bob is planning on using the money to buy a gun and shoot his wife, and that if you pay Bob his money you are actively complicit in the murder. (And for whatever reason if he gets the money the police won't be able to stop the murder- it's a hypothetical situation!)</p>\n<p>You now have a conflict- base on past considerations (the work done), you have an obligation to pay him.\nBased on future considerations (the planned murder) you have an obligation not to pay him. What do you do?</p>\n<p>In this case, the general rule should be not to pay him the money. In other words, the future consideration would win out.\nIt doesn't remove the past consideration- you still owe him the money- but you will need to pay him in a different way.</p>\n<p>This is a general concept of how G-d runs things. He doesn't just take into account what a person is owed based on the past, He also considers future ramifications.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>What could be the future justification of killing out Amalekites?\nIt's really a variation of the old \"Baby Hitler\" question.\nIf you had the chance to kill adolf hitler while he was still an infant, thus preventing the Holocaust, would you?</p>\n<p>Now generally, this can't be taken too far in a practical sense. We as humans have no way of knowing what a baby would be like when it grows up, and we cannot make such calculations. Who could have predicted what Hitler would become? But if we had a way of knowing the future, so we could know 100% what Hitler would become, then there's a strong argument to kill him as a baby. It's just we are limited.</p>\n<p>But G-d's not.\nG-d can say that Amalekites (or members of the 7 Caananite nations) are a danger to society and must be eliminated.\nIn classic Jewish thought Amalek is considered the archrival of Klal Yisrael (the Jewish people).\nKlal Yisrael's purpose is to bring the world to a recognition of G-d, and thus elevate the world to the Messianic era of unity and perfection.\nAmalek is the enemy, the one trying to prevent the Jewish people from leading the world to this state of perfection. They are the epitome of evil.\n(See the Wikipedia site on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalek\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amalek</a>, the section on Jewish Traditions, which brings some accurate traditional sources on this issue.)</p>\n<p>This being the case, we can reframe the issue. The commandment to wipe out the memory of Amalek- even the children and animals- is because as long as there's a remnant of Amalek around, the world can't reach it perfection. All war, suffering and pain today is because Amalek was never fully wiped out.</p>\n<p>Thus the commandment to kill them is the same as a commandment given to kill baby hitler- if it was given from an omnipotent, omniscient being who was reliable.</p>\n\n\n",

Whilst on face value nowadays walking along the road doesn't seem so bad, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.7?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Pirkei_Avot.3.7.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos Yom Tov</a> points to the fact that (at least at those times),the roads were places where danger lurked. So to be learning Torah in such a scenario is highlighted as a particular error. The idea being that one who forfeits the protective power of Torah, one leaves oneself vulnerable to potential danger. He additionally adds that while there are those who would say it is not dangerous, the fact that he is out and about in nature means he is a lot more likely to be distracted by the scenery.</p>\n<p>So with that as a starting point - why then is such a person called out for 'mortal guilt'?</p>\n<p>Rashi concurs with Tosafos Yom Tov that being out on the road is a dangerous exercise and as such, having relinquished the protection afforded to one who is engaged in Torah study he bears responsibility for whatever adversity he suffers on this danger-laden road. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.7?lang=bi&p2=Rabbeinu_Yonah_on_Pirkei_Avot.3.7.4&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Yonah</a> similarly adds that by interrupting his learning by \"שיחת חולין\" - \"mundane talk\" he is thereby indicting himself.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind this strong condemnation of כְּאִלּוּ מִתְחַיֵּב בְּנַפְשׁוֹ is underlined by the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2835&st=&pgnum=127&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a> who writes that since man by his nature is drawn to the mundane and meaningless, one seemingly minor interruption can lead to a series of distractions ultimately leading to the complete rejection of the yoke of Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והטעם שטבעו של אדם נמשך אחר ההבלים והשיחות בטילות, וימשך ממנו בזה עד שיפרוק עול תורה לגמרי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, it is written in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=149381&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=15912940338848832&pagenum=103\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avos</a> how the Gemorah likens men to fish (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Habakkuk.1.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chavakuk 1:14</a>), and just as fish die when they come on to dry land, so too men die in a spiritual sense when they withdraw from Torah (he draws this from the gemorah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.3b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 3b</a>).

And, <strong>we find no instance when He repented from a good thing</strong> save only at the destruction of the First Temple, when he assured the righteous that they would not die together with the wicked and retracted it, as it appears in Tractat Shabbat. Herefrom we learn that a prophet is tested solely by his prophecy concerning good tidings, which is in harmony with what Jeremiah said in his reply to Hananiah son of Azzur, when Jeremiah was prophesying evil tidings and Hananiah good, saying unto him: \"If my words will not be established, it would yet not be evidence that I am a false prophet; but if thy words be not established it will be proclaimed that thou art a false prophet\". For it is said: \"Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against many kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence; the prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him\" (Jer. 28.7–9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Returning found item to house of idolatry\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one finds an item which belongs to a house of idolatry, should or could they return it to the institution?</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.266?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 266</a> and commentaries discuss the idolators and returning the list item to them. But I didn't see anyone discussing this case.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of somewhat relevant questions on this site seen <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22033/does-the-mitzvah-to-return-a-lost-object-apply-to-aveirah-items\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77505/returning-lost-property-to-a-gentile\">here</a> for instance, but none seem to address this specific case.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Let's pick one particular case: suppose I find keys with a tag that says <strong>FIRST AVE PAGAN TEMPLE -- VAN #2</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Practically today, Jews are obligated to return lost property to anyone, including pagans; if nothing else, think of the reputation of God's name, and what goes around comes around, help-wise. So if the tag said <strong>Property of Bob the Plumber</strong> (who I know happens to be pagan), I'd return those keys.</p>\n\n<p>The question then left is whether the temple's van is any different. We will assume the van is not used purely in-and-of itself as the tool of pagan worship. (Okay maybe the van takes some people to get there, but there's another way they could have gotten there, maybe it's going to the picnic ...) We then point to the Gemara in Nedarim 62b, that a rabbi <em>actively sold</em> firewood to a pagan temple. His colleagues asked \"aren't they going to use that to burn their pagan sacrifices?\" And he replied that it's much more likely it would simply be used to keep the building warm in the winter. In short, you could actively sell a \"dual-use\" item to a pagan temple.</p>\n\n<p>If you can sell them firewood, you can sell them a van; and if you can sell them a van, you can return their lost van keys, knowing that whatever favor goes around, comes around.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Well if it itself has anything to do with idolatry, there is in fact an obligation to destroy not only it, but even the place it was taken from,as mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912365/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-Seven.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Avodas Kochavim chapter 6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1</p>\n  \n  <p>It is a positive commandment to destroy false deities, all their\n  accessories, and everything that is made for their purposes, as\n  [Deuteronomy 12:2] states: \"You shall surely destroy all the places\n  [where the gentiles... served their gods]\" and, as [implied by\n  Deuteronomy 7:5]: \"Rather, what you should do to them is tear down\n  their altars.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>In Eretz Yisrael, the mitzvah requires us to hunt after idol worship\n  until it is eradicated from our entire land. In the diaspora, however,\n  we are not required to hunt after it. Rather, whenever we conquer a\n  place, we must destroy all the false deities contained within.</p>\n  \n  <p>[The source for this distinction is Deuteronomy 12:3, which] states:\n  \"And you shall destroy their name from this place,\" [implying that]\n  you are obligated to hunt false deities in Eretz Yisrael, but you are\n  not obligated to do so in the diaspora.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Besides for that, there is a prohibition of benefiting from them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden to benefit from false deities, their accessories,\n  offerings for them, and anything made for them, as [implied by\n  Deuteronomy 7:26]: \"Do not bring an abomination to your home.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Anyone who derives benefit from any of the above receives two measures\n  of lashes: one because of the prohibition, \"Do not bring an\n  abomination...,\" and one because of the prohibition, \"Let nothing\n  which is condemned cling to your hand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so even if it can be argued for some reason that returning it to someone is not benefit, and if (for some reason) the obligation to destroy it is disregarded, but you are at least causing the other person to benefit from it, and there is a prohibition to not put a stumbling block in front of the blind. There are many examples of this law, one that comes to mind is\n<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?rambamChapters=3&tdate=01%2F21%2F1841\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Kilayim chapter 10 halacha 31</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>31</p>\n  \n  <p>[The following laws apply when] a person dresses a colleague in\n  kilayim. If the wearer acted consciously, he is liable for lashes73\n  and the person who dressed him is liable for \"plac[ing] a stumbling\n  block before the blind.\"74</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and this prohibition (of not worshipping idols) also applies to non-jews, as mentioned in hilchos melachim umilchamoseihem chapter 9 halacha 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2</p>\n  \n  <p>A gentile who worships false gods is liable provided he worships them\n  in an accepted manner.</p>\n  \n  <p>A gentile is executed for every type of foreign worship which a Jewish\n  court would consider worthy of capital punishment. However, a gentile\n  is not executed for a type of foreign worship which a Jewish court\n  would not deem worthy of capital punishment. Nevertheless, even though\n  a gentile will not be executed for these forms of worship, he is\n  forbidden to engage in all of them.</p>\n  \n  <p>We should not allow them to erect a monument, or to plant an Asherah,\n  or to make images and the like even though they are only for the sake\n  of beauty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>as well as the prohibition of a jew to cause a non-jew to sin, following under the category of not placing a stumbling block in front of the blind, applies as well, as demonstrated from this other example case from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?rambamChapters=3&tdate=11%2F06%2F1830#v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hilchos kilayim halacha #2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Jew is forbidden to give his animal to a gentile to have him mate it\n  with a forbidden species.8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and it's explained the rational in the note there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8.</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on Bava Metzia 90a, the Radbaz and the Kessef Mishneh state that\n  the difficulty is that it is forbidden to give a gentile instructions\n  to perform a prohibited activity. According to the Rambam (Hilchot\n  Melachim 10:6), it is forbidden for a gentile to crossbreed species.\n  The Rama (loc. cit.:4), however, states that if the act is performed\n  for the benefit of the gentile, there is no prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He begins by mentioning the idea that dark skin was a result of Noah's curse to Canaan. In that case, he says, we would have to assume that all the physiological differences between people of different skin colors occurred at the time of Noah's curse, and not due to the heat of the lands they lived in. He supports this by noting that when northern people with light skin move to the southern locations where it is hot and the people have dark skin, their skin does not turn dark – nor does the skin of their descendants change even after several hundred years.</p>\n\n<p>However, he then argues the reverse that it is indeed because of the heat that their skin became dark. In response to the aforementioned objection, he explains that skin color is not a binary choice; rather there is a continuum ranging from very light to very dark. Skin color proceeds along the continuum from one country to the next, and changes very slowly over hundreds of years as the heat enters their bodies. If we accept this approach then Adam and Eve would have had light skin and dark skin evolved over a very long period of time. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>We don't know.

Are we led to believe that there were Jews that were not enslaved? Or perhaps they developed these positions over the period of the 10 plagues?

Specifically, Reuven, Shimon, and Levi who did not receive an inheritance in Eretz Yisroel proper had more independence in Egypt to have Jewish slaves (perhaps not having the land to hope for would have made being a slave too emotionally crushing). Although the Meshech Chochma does not suggest the Egyptians desired their position of power, it does note the higher positions these tribes had.   </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The actual expression in the Midrash there is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁהָיוּ פּוֹשְׁעִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁהָיָה לָהֶן פַּטְרוֹנִין מִן הַמִּצְרִיִּים וְהָיָה לָהֶן שָׁם עשֶׁר וְכָבוֹד</p>\n<p>there were wicked Jews <em>who had Egyptian patrons</em> and who had wealth\nand honor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, these Jews were indeed slaves or dependents of these Egyptian masters/patrons, but through their association with said masters, they could amass fortunes of their own. Compare <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Dependents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Dependents</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Slavery\" has also been used to refer to a legal state of dependency to somebody else. For example, in Persia, the situations and lives of such slaves could be better than those of common citizens.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it may well have been the same in Egypt.</p>\n\n\n",

These were Meïr, Judah ben Ilai, José ben Chalafta, Jochanan of Alexandria, Simon ben Jochai, Eleazar ben Jacob (or ben Shamua) and Nehemiah. They repaired directly to the plain of Rimmon, made notable during the Revolution, to consider <strong>the introduction of a leap year, the calendar probably having become incorrect</strong>. At the first meeting a fierce contest ensued, probably with reference to one of the Halachas of Akiba, but the dispute terminated in a friendly settlement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Page 443:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The wisdom of the Patriarch Simon II. deftly avoided this breach. Chananya established a sort of Synhedrion in Nahar-Pakod, probably in the neighborhood of Nahardea, of which he was the president, whilst a certain Nechunyan, perhaps the Prince of the Captivity, appears to have supported him. The Babylonian community, until then under the control of Judæa, and now left uncared for through the destruction of all religious institutions in the fatherland, welcomed a Synhedrion in their midst as of joyful import, and gratefully accepted its ordinances and decisions. Chananya immediately <strong>introduced a leap year</strong>, and the celebration of the festivals as had been customary in Judæa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Page 572:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The custom had prevailed up till now of <strong>keeping secret the computation of the new moon and the leap year</strong>, and of making known the times of the festivals to the communities in the neighboring lands by announcing them by messengers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The mathematical part of the Rabbinic calendar was developed in the period C.E. 700-950.

In this manner, they would calculate and establish one full month and one lacking month - establishing these months, but not sanctifying them.7 For the sanctification of the months is dependent solely on the sighting [of the moon]. At times they would have a full month follow another full month, or a lacking month follow another lacking month, depending on the results of their calculations.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore the sages would have to know the calculations to catch false-witnesses claiming to have seen the new moon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Many years ago, I read (non-Jewish source, without explicit external references) that the calendar calculations have actually been in effect since Moses, but were kept in secret for many centuries.

There were other factors involved as well. The Gemara goes on at length to discuss how it was determined. Being that  some of what the Gemara mentions had been written in   the Tosefta the manner of determining leap years does not seem to have ever been a secret.</p>\n\n\n",

Yaakov Kaminetsky, I think) inquired whether they ever held a kiddush in her honor and they said no, so he told them to do one then. </p>\n\n<p>Long story short -- these are nice customs if you feel like it, but there's a tremendous amount of leeway.</p>\n\n\n",

When the gemara in megillah is talking about why certain brachos are connected in Shemenoh Asrei, Rashi, comments that's what is bracha all about, since it right at the start of the Amidah and we speak about redemption later on. So Rashi explains that this bracha is a request to take us out of our own distresses, which when Leah is distress she retorts and says Hashem has seen my affliction. (Which fits very nicely to what happened to Revuen that he was the firstborn, but that transferred over to Yosef but instead of being distress he instead didn't want to kill him rather protect from that danger- Food for Thought).   </p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.907.11?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצבה שאהובה לאבות שנואה לבנים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, in a sense, Hashem was courting the alters upon which we could have a relationship with him. Ultimately the Mizbeach was singled out. The Mizbeach therefore, more so than any other vessel from the Mikdosh, understands the feelings a person has when they choose to marry, having been chosen from amongst all other perspective suitors. And therefore the mizbeach is the one that cries when that bond is dissolved. \nThere was never an alternate ark to the Aron, candelabra to the Menora, or table to the Shulchan from which the ones for the Mikdash were chosen. So they can't commiserate with this emotion. The Mizbeach, as noted, can.</p>\n\n\n",

Some examples of note, based on a brief perusal:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Page 2: The brachah on tzitzis. (The questions there being 1. what is their (non-rabbinic) source for a brachah, and 2. why is the text of a brachah --שם ומלכות, אקב\"ו--virtually the same as Rabbinic brachos?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Page 6: Text at the beginning of and in between every line of the Kedusha that does not quote directly from the text of the praises of the Malachim in the Navi. (The question there being that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.91b.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">purpose of kedushah</a> is specifically with regard to the verses that the Malachim say--the question can, in fact, extend to the source of the Kedusha, which seems to be Rabbinic based on that Gemara.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Page 7: A verse in between the verse of Shema and the following paragraph of Ve'ahavta. (If the section is quoted straight from the Torah, there should be no verse in between Shema and Ve'ahavta--it seems to be rooted in the Rabbinic liturgical structure of including Baruch Shem Kevod).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there a documented Rabbinic influence on Karaite liturgy, and if so, how does the Karaite community reconcile this influence in their prayer when (as I understand it) they largely reject Rabbinic influence?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I am a Karaite jew (from a Karaite family, raised in a Karaite community). I just posted a video introducing the Karaite liturgy and how it is composed. You can watch it here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrR6THBLhSA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrR6THBLhSA</a></p>\n<p>To answer your specific questions - yes, the modern siddur does have certain rabbinic influences. The reason for that is that the compiler of this siddur was a Karaite Sage named Aaron ben Joseph. He was steeped in the rabbinic tradition, and you can see that he even wrote a poem for parashat Lech Lecha in which he incorporated the midrash of Abraham smashing the idols: <a href=\"http://abluethread.com/2015/09/08/a-place-for-rabbinic-thought-in-karaite-literature/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://abluethread.com/2015/09/08/a-place-for-rabbinic-thought-in-karaite-literature/</a></p>\n<p>The Karaite community since the time of Aaron ben Joseph has accepted rabbinic influence when it is not contradicted by the Torah. (This, in my opinion, led to the weakening of the movement, not because there is anything bad about the rabbinic tradition, but because no minority movement can survive if it is just a lighter version of the majority.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think you may have a mistaken assumption. It seems like you are assuming that Karaites have an entirely different tradition than we do. But the reality is that Karaites broke off from Rabbinic Judaism. Karaites are not the direct descendants of the Sadduccees (anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong), but are a group of Rabbinic-ish Jews who felt \"Rabbinic Judaism\" had \"gone too far off the path\" and broke off to \"do Judaism better\" in the 9th century.</p>\n<p>An example of doing \"Judaism better\" would be: The Calendar.</p>\n<p>Rabbinic Judaism in the 9th century used a mathematical formula to predict months, days, holydays, years, etc and is still using this method today. But Rabbinic Judaism attests to what \"the\" prior method was: Eye-Witness testimony of the new moon to the Sanhedrin, and then the Sanhedrin declares the new moon. But after the Romans exiled us from Israel it was too difficult to use this Rabincally attested eye-witness method testimony and so understandably the calculation method became the method for Rabbinic Jews to use. I say that the eye-witness method was \"Rabbinically attested\" because the Bible doesn't mention how to calculate the new moon, and concepts like the sanhedrin are nowhere to be found. Even the word Sanhedrin is a Greek word, and we don't see any mention of a Sanhedrin type of institution until some of the Apocryphal books (which we have rejected), and even then the Sanhedrin was called a senate. So why is all this important?</p>\n<p>It's important because in the 9th and 10th centuries it becomes possible to easily have eye witness testimony about when the new moons are, and it turns out the eye-witness testimony and the mathematical calculations don't match. So now you have a situation where you <strong>know</strong> you are celebrating holidays <em><strong>on the wrong days</strong></em>. So what do you do? Karaites decided to take Rabbinic Judaism's word on the eye-witness method and adopted it for their use. They use this method to this day, and there are still calendar conflicts between these calendar systems to this day.</p>\n<p>Karaite Judaism admits a shared inheritance with Rabbinic Judaism, but the Karaites decided Rabbinates kept deviating from the truth unnecessarily. So don't be surprised to see not only Rabbinic influences in prayer, but in customs, ideas, translations, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, there was no one that was on Moshe's caliber to pray for them and save them from G-ds anger as Moshe did so many times; Moshe couldn't because אין קטיגור נעשה סניגור.

Ideally, only if one is certain he won't miss the time for Davening Mincha, he should Daven just before <em>shekia</em> (sunset) making sure to complete it just before sunset:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכתחלה מנחה קטנה עדיף שזו זמנה כנגד התדיר וזו כנגד ערבי פסחים שאינו תדיר וכן כתב הרב פ\"ג מה' תפלה ואמ\"ר חייא בר אבא א\"ר יוחנן מצוה להתפלל עם דמדומי חמה שנאמר ייראוך עם שמש ואע\"ג דלייטי עלה במערבא הנ\"מ מאן דמאחר טפי אבל קודם ביאת השמש כמעט שפיר דמי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed the Arizal also did like his Rebbe the Radvaz and Davened Mincha just before Shekia which is the most auspicious time, as quote in Ben Yehoyada Brachos 29b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פתח עינים ז\"ל בשם תוספות ישנים כתב יד, בשעה שיצא ונכנס הוא אדום כדם, וזהו דמדומי חמה...רבינו האר\"י ז\"ל היה מתפלל מנחה עם דמדומי חמה, כסברת ר' יוחנן דסבירא ליה במערבא לא פליגי על ר' יוחנן, אלא הם דברו בהמון העם בעל עסקים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When davening with a minian one has to convene at a set time and therefore will not let the time pass, so it is even more ideal to daven with a Minian just before Shekia. But if one is on his own with jobs to do without anyone to remind him then he should daven at Mincha ketana rather than risk missing Mincha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>FYI,  mincha ketana begins from 9.5 hours into the day (where an hour is a \"shaa zemaniyos\" hour which is based on the length of time between netz and skiyah or alos and tzies hakochvaim) so \"just before shekiya\" falls within the range of mincha ketana. They're not two different times unless you meant to say at the beginning of mincha ketana.</p>\n<p>Based on what you wrote in your question, I am interpreting that you are asking is it better to daven earlier without a minyan but within the proper time for mincha or is it better to daven with a minyan at the \"buzzer\" (the last possible moment risking going past shkiyah.) If I do not have the question correct, I apologize and please reword it so we can understand it better.</p>\n<p>If I have it correct, as long as you get your shemoneh esrey in before shkiya, you are good and that would be preferable than davening without a minyan earlier. (I am not including a source as it is well known that one should not be quick to daven without a minyan even if they have better kavanah see Igrot Moshe (O.C. 3:7). If you will end up saying shemonah esrei after shkiyah then you run into halachik issues unless you hold like rabbeinu taam skiyah (like chasidim) who have a bit more leeway davening after what many consider shkiyah.</p>\n\n\n",

The more one spends on Shabbat expenses, and the more one prepares tasty foods for this day the more praiseworthy it is”</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The concept of Oneg Shabbat is learnt from a verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.58.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ספר ישעיה נח:יג-יד</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִם־תָּשִׁ֤יב מִשַּׁבָּת֙ רַגְלֶ֔ךָ עֲשׂ֥וֹת חֲפָצֶ֖יךָ בְּי֣וֹם קָדְשִׁ֑י <strong>וְקָרָ֨אתָ לַשַּׁבָּ֜ת עֹ֗נֶג</strong> לִקְד֤וֹשׁ ה' מְכֻבָּ֔ד וְכִבַּדְתּוֹ֙ מֵעֲשׂ֣וֹת דְּרָכֶ֔יךָ מִמְּצ֥וֹא חֶפְצְךָ֖ וְדַבֵּ֥ר דָּבָֽר׃</p>\n<p><em>If you refrain from trampling the sabbath, From pursuing your affairs on My holy day; <strong>If you call the sabbath “delight,”</strong> The LORD’s holy day “honored”; And if you honor it and go not your ways Nor look to your affairs, nor strike bargains—</em></p>\n<p>אָ֗ז תִּתְעַנַּג֙ עַל־ה' וְהִרְכַּבְתִּ֖יךָ עַל־בָּ֣מֳותֵי אָ֑רֶץ וְהַאֲכַלְתִּ֗יךָ נַחֲלַת֙ יַעֲקֹ֣ב אָבִ֔יךָ כִּ֛י פִּ֥י ה' דִּבֵּֽר׃</p>\n<p>Then you can seek the favor of the LORD. I will set you astride the heights of the earth, And let you enjoy the heritage of your father Jacob— For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.\n(Translation - Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Parenthetically, it is important to note that although physicality is promoted, this should not be to the detriment of the spiritual side. HaRav Eliyahu Dessler זצ\"ל observes that the עונג שבת serves to enhance the spiritual enjoyment we have. This means to say, whilst we delight in various delicacies and get dressed in smart clothes, these physical elements are ultimately the conduit for greater spiritual performance. מכתה מאליהו, חלק ב', עמוד 14. He writes, \"אך הלא נצטווינו לענג את השבת במאכלים ערבים בבגדים נעים במטה מוצעת ובנרות דולקים וכן כתוב \"וקראת לשבת עונג ולקדוש ה' מכובד\" (ישעיה נח). ועי' בזהר (אמור צד) \"מאי עונג?...דהאי עונג על ה' הוא\" פי' אודות ה', שהעונג יבוא מן הרוחניות לבד ולא מן התענוגים הגשמיים. כה גדולה היא קדושת השבת עד שגם אלה מוכנסים על ידה לתחום הרוחניות.\" – <em>“We are commanded to take pleasure in Shabbat with tasty foods, nice clothes, a bed that is made and lit candles, as it is written, “And you shall call Shabbat ‘a delight’, and the holy (day) ‘honored’” (Yeshaya 58). And in the Zohar (Emor 94) it says: “What is this “delight”? ...It is delighting in Hashem. That means in regards to Hashem. The delight should come from spirituality alone and not from physical pleasures. This is the greatness of the holiness of Shabbos. Through it, even physical pleasure is elevated to the realm of spirituality”</em>.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How these malachim became involved with the origins of idolatry?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Parsha <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0413.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelach 13:33</a> says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And there we saw the <strong>Nephilim</strong>, the <strong>sons of Anak</strong>, who come of the\n<strong>Nephilim</strong>; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were\nin their sight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe elaborated on this (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14951&st=&pgnum=101\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Sichos vol. 28, p. 89</a>) and says that these <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12223/what-were-the-nephilim\">Nephilim</a> were the fallen ones, i.e. malachim that fell in the days of Enosh and they were also involved with the origins of idolatry.</p>\n<p>My question is: How did this happen? Did they originate the idea of idolatry and give it to the people, or, being only malachim, were they only affected by the evil of that generation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From a couple of sources it seems that they didn't originate the idea of Avodah Zara but assisted in developing it further.</p>\n<p>First, on the development of idolatry, Rambam states that idolatry came from man in a gradual process (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Avodah Zara 1:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"During the times of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one of those who erred.\nTheir mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.<br />\nAfter conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.<br />\nThis was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there is no other god except for this star.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here we see that mankind was responsible for the creation of idolatry.</p>\n<p><strong>Midrash of Shemchazzai and Azael:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"R. Joseph was once asked what was the story of Shemḥazai and Azael, and he replied, 'When the generation of Enosh arose and worshipped idols, and when the generation of the flood arose and went astray, God was grieved that He had created man, as it is said, \"And the Lord repented that He had made man, and He was grieved at heart.\" Then two angels, whose names were Shemḥazai and ‘Azael, appeared before God, and said, \"O Lord of the universe, did we not say unto Thee when Thou didst create Thy world, 'Do not create man'?\" as it is said, \"What is man, that Thou shouldst remember him?\" \"Then what shall become of the world?\" said God. They replied, \"We will occupy ourselves with it.\" God said, \"It is revealed and well known to Me that if peradventure you had lived in that earthly world, the evil inclination would have swayed you just as much as it rules over the sons of man, but you would be more stubborn than they.\" \"Give us Thy sanction, then, and let us descend among the creatures, and then Thou shalt see how we shall sanctify Thy name.\" \"Descend,\" spake the Lord, \"and dwell ye among them.\"</p>\n<p>Forthwith He allowed the evil inclination to sway them. As soon as they descended and beheld the daughters of man that they were beautiful, they began to disport themselves with them, as it is said, \"When the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of man,\" they could not restrain their inclination...When Shemḥazai and ‘Azael saw this they took to them wives, and begat children. The former begat two children, whose names were Heyya, and Aheyya. And ‘Azael was appointed chief over all the dyes, and over all kinds of ornaments by which women entice men to thoughts of sin...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Me'am Lo'ez Bamidbar, pp. 271-272 (my translation):</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And why was that place called '<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.24.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">eyes unveiled</a>'? For there were two angels who spoke negatively about the creation of man and their names were Azah and Azael. And when the generation of the flood came along, which was a generation that rebelled and worshipped idolatry and did many sins...and when they [the angels] descended, they saw beautiful women and their evil inclination overpowered them and they could not control their inclination and sinned with them. And then the Holy One Blessed is He saw that these angels were sinning and using the names of impurity that they knew and were causing mankind to sin even more...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From these two sources we see that the angels didn't teach idolatry, they just taught things that made it even worse - dyes and ornaments to entice women and names of impurity. Idolatry had already begun to be developed during the time of Enosh (and see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Noach.18.3?vhe=Tsel_Midrash_Tanchuma&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Noach 18:3</a>).</p>\n<p>It should be noted that there are traditions about the Nefilim in apocryphal literature and in the Dead Sea Scrolls (together called 'Enochic literature') and there are several parallels between these sources and traditional Jewish sources. For example, also according to 1 Enoch ch. <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe010.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7</a><a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe011.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">-8</a>, the angels didn't teach idolatry. They taught witchcraft, how to make weapons from metal, and usage of dyes, ornaments and gemstones.</p>\n\n\n",

We can quibble over whether it actually is the simplest and most straight-forward explanation of the Zohar, but it does appear to be his understanding of the text. This assumption, that the Zohar is to be so read is shared by others. For example, <a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F_(%D7%A8%D7%91)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yaakov Edelstein</a>, a contemporary of the Be'er Yosef (although younger), similarly attributed the view, that the spies had ruah haqodesh, directly to the Zohar in his Haye Yaaqov <em>Beikvei HaTzon parshas Shelach</em> (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=628592&pagenum=326\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> for those with Otzar HaChochmah):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nl9FG.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nl9FG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I believe the underlying assumption of such a reading of the Zohar, is that without such an assumption how could the spies have positively affirmed that בארעא לא נזכי - that in the land they would not merit such a position? How could they have known that? Underlying assumption: they had ruah haqodesh. Yes, you can read this section of the Zohar otherwise, but I believe that this is in fact the simple reading of the Zohar <em>according to</em> the Be'er Yosef, Haye Yaaqov, et al.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>So I looked through a number of mefarshim (commentaries) and there doesn't appear to be any reference to any prophecy. As you say, many mention this Zohar, but I think it would be fair to say that the Be'er Yosef's words are more his own personal presentation of the facts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Yitzchok_Ruderman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman zt\"l</a> questions in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Yitzchok_Ruderman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sichos Avodas Levi 59</a> how the Meraglim could have come to give such a false report about the land. He brings the Zohar that notes how they did not want to lose their positions of leadership and thus provided the false report. Importantly, he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה בהשקפה ראשונה נראה כאילו המרגלים הם רשעים גמורים שרוצים להזיק לכל האומה באופן נורא מאד רק כדי שלא יפסידו מעמדם. אולם, נ<strong>ראה שכוונת הזוה\"ק היא שהמרגלים היו נוגעים בדבר, והנגיעות עיוורה את עיניהם, ולכן חשבו שאינם יכולים לכבוש את ארץ ישראל מחמת המדות טובות של הכנענים. ולפ\"ז נראה לבאר שעיקר חטא המרגלים היה במה שלא התבוננו במחשבותם, שאילו היו מתבוננים בעצמם היו מכירים מיד שכל מה שאומרים הוא מחמת הנגיעות</strong>. והנה מזה יש ללמוד שאנו צריכים להתבונן היטב להבין מה הוא המקור של מחשבתינו, שלפעמים אנו מחזיקים בשיטות שאינן נכונות מחמת איזו נגיעה שנמצאת בלבנו.</p>\n<p>And here at first glance it appears as if the spies are completely wicked who wanted to harm the whole nation in a very terrible way just so that they would not lose their status/position. <strong>However it appears that the holy Zohar's intention is that the spies were tied up in the matter, and this involvement skewed their eyes and therefore they weren't able to think about conquering the land of Israel as a result of the good attribute of the Canaanites. Accordingly, we can explain that the main sin of the spies was that they were not able to (truly) understand their thoughts; that if they looked at themselves they would immediately recognize that everything that they said was because of their own negios (i.e. they were caught up in their own personal motives).</strong> And from this we must learn that we need to look closely and understand what is the source of our thoughts since sometimes we possess approaches that are incorrect because of some 'negiah' that is in our heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Rav Ruderman clearly points to the fact that their motives were driven not by any sort of prophecy but rather due to an acknowledgement that the end result would prove unfavourable to them.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Bornsztain_(second_Sochatchover_rebbe)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sokatchover Rebbe</a> in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shem_MiShmuel%2C_Sh%27lach.6.7?vhe=Sefer_Shem_Mishmuel,_Piotrkow,_1927-1934&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shem MiShmuel</a> on the parsha likewise brings this Zohar and makes a similar assumption, again that with the understanding that it was deep-rooted in more personal motives and not that of a Divinely-inspired prophecy.</p>\n<p>He notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש לתמוה מאחר דכלהו זכאין הוו ורישי דישראל הוו, היתכן שבשביל נגיעת עצמם ובקשת השררה ישחיתו את כל הענין, שדבר כזה לא יתכן אפי' לפשוט שבפשוטים להשחית את כל תקות ישראל ורצון הש\"י והמתנה שאבות העולם חמדו לה ובנין בהמ\"ק וקישור שמים וארץ וכל הטובות שבעולם הכל בשביל נגיעת עצמם</p>\n<p>And we have to ask (what it means) that \"all of them were meritorious and heads of Israel\" - it is possible that it was due to their personal bias (negios) and the desire for power that corrupted the whole matter. Otherwise it would not have been possible even to explain how they came to destroy all the hopes of Israel and the will of G-d and the gift that the fathers of the world (i.e. Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov) coveted. And the construction of the Temple, and linking heaven and earth and all the good things in the world all due to their personal bias...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, when looking for a simple reading of the Zohar, I looked at the Baal HaSulam by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Ashlag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yehuda Leib Ashlag</a> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14246&st=&pgnum=320&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (refer to the letter lamed at the bottom of the page) and he explains it no differently, that their worry was losing their position of leadership, again with no mention of prophecy or the like.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.48.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Orach Chaim 48</a> writes that it was instituted that the passage of the <em>tamid</em> be recited daily, because of this <em>gemara</em>.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Orach Chaim 1</a> also writes that it is good to recite many of the other passages of <em>korbanot</em> (<em>olah</em>, <em>minchah</em>, <em>shelamim</em>, <em>chatat</em>, <em>asham</em>). <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.1.15.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit Yosef ad loc.</a> explains that this is also because of this <em>gemara</em>. (It's worth noting that very few <em>siddurim</em> published today contain these passages.)</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_on_Megillah.4.9.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Megillah 4:9</a> connects the practice of reading a <em>maftir</em> on festivals that deals with the <em>korbanot</em> of the day to this <em>gemara</em>.</p>\n<p>Presumably, any of the passages that appear in the <em>siddur</em> which describe the temple service (so in a \"standard\" <em>ashkenazi siddur</em> most of the passages from that of the <em>kiyyor</em> until <em>rabi yishma'el</em>) would constitute a way of fulfilling this <em>gemara</em>. (I would note that the <em>gemara</em> talks about <strong>reading</strong> the <em>seder korbanot</em>, so it is possible that learning <em>torah shebe'al peh</em> (<em>pitum haketoret</em>, <em>eizehu mekoman</em>) would not strictly count, although it is certainly a fulfillment of the idea behind it.)</p>\n\n\n",

In his commentary to the Mishnah Rambam doesn’t describe the plant; he merely mentions it as one of the ingredients in the anointing oil. (Presumably <em>because</em> there is no explanation given) R. Kapach has a footnote where he cites Rambam from Mishneh Torah in explanation of what this plant is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב רבנו בחבורו הם הקנים הדקים כתבן האדומים הבאים מאיי הודו וריחן טוב והם ממיני הבשמים שנותנים אותם הרופאים בצרי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that this still doesn’t give us a modern name of a plant that we can relate to, R. Kapach concludes the note by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והוא Acorus Calamus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. the plant that Rambam mentions here and which he describes in Mishneh Torah is the plant called Acorus Calamus. In fact, the Wikipedia page for this plant which you linked in the question indeed mentions that this plant grows in India:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sweet flag grows in India, central Asia, southern Russia and Siberia, and Europe. Habitats include edges of small lakes, ponds and rivers, marshes, swamps, and wetlands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thousands of examples could likely be given if one were to compile such a list, but one that I remember clearly having caused me to ask this question was hearing in the name of Rabbi Meir of Rottenberg that one who dies to sanctify Hashem's Name doesn't feel pain. Who told him so, and why he, not anyone else? We don't have prophets, and when looking at some of these statements, they are far more than inspired guidance or the like - they are concise detailed knowledge about things that humans generally have no knowledge aside from through direct prophecy.

Is Otniel the younger brother of Kalev, or is it Kenaz who is Kalev’s brother (which would mean that Otniel was Kalev's nephew)?</p>\n<p>One would be tempted to understand that Kenaz is the brother of Kalev, because otherwise we are left with a question: If Kalev and Otniel are brothers, then what was their father's name, Yephuneh or Kenaz?</p>\n<p>However, the classical Jewish commentators (unanimously as far as I can tell) do understand that Kalev and Otniel were brothers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Joshua.15.17.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rashi</strong> to Yehoshua 15:17</a> (following <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.11b.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chazal</a>) solves the question of Yephuneh vs Kenaz by suggesting that Kalev and Otniel were half-brothers, sharing a mother.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Joshua.15.17.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Radak</strong> there</a> writes that Kalev and Otniel were full brothers. He suggests that Yephuneh and Kenaz were the same man, with two names. Alternatively, he offers the interpretation (which he prefers) that Kalev and Otniel's father was named Yephuneh, and that Kenaz was a distant ancestor whose name was adopted by his descendants.</p>\n<p>Why don't any commentators offer the seemingly more simple solution that Kenaz was Kalev's brother, rather than Otniel?</p>\n<p>I believe that this is because Kalev himself is referred to as a Kenizzite (הקנזי) (e.g. in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.32.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 32:12</a>).</p>\n<p>If Kenaz was Kalev's younger brother, this would be a strange way to refer to him.

It is about accepting responsibility rather than taking what you please; in other words, it is, indeed, speaking about conversion.</p>\n<p>Or is it?</p>\n<p>In fact, one could take your question to an extreme. Perhaps the midrash means that I, as a Yisroel, can perform the mitzvos of a kohen? Perhaps I can serve in the temple etc? Well, of course we know this isnt true. The Torah isn't a one size fits all proposition. The Torah teaches that kohanim have certain mitzvos, yisraels have less, and the gentiles have seven mitzvos. \"Accepting the Torah\" for a gentile, means accepting the 7 mitzvos which the Torah teaches for him.

    "content": "# How should I understand gemaras where people quote verses that were not yet written at the time the story takes place?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In various places in Talmud Bavli, there are stories told that take place during the times of Torah or Neviim where people in the story quote verses from prophetic books that did not yet exist at the time the story took place. How am I to understand these stories? Are they not literal? Are the quoted pesukim something that was originally Torah sh'bal peh?</p>\n<p>For example: The Gemara in Bava Basra 22a-b says over a story wherein Yoav only kills male Edomites in a war based on a misreading of the verse תמחה את זכר עמלק to mean to kill only the males (\"zachor\" instead of \"zecher\"). Yoav confronts his childhood teacher and the following exchange occurs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שקל ספסירא למיקטליה אמר ליה אמאי א\"ל דכתיב (ירמיהו מח, י) ארור עושה מלאכת ה' רמיה א\"ל שבקיה לההוא גברא דליקום בארור א\"ל כתיב (ירמיהו מח, י) וארור מונע חרבו מדם איכא דאמרי קטליה ואיכא דאמרי לא קטליה</p>\n<p>Joab took a sword to kill him. The teacher said to him: Why do you\nwant to kill me? Joab said to him: As it is written: “Cursed is he who\ndoes the work of the Lord with a slack hand” (Jeremiah 48:10), and you\ntaught me incorrectly. The teacher said to him: Leave that man to\nremain as cursed. This is a sufficient punishment; there is no need to\nkill me. Joab said to him: It is also written: “And cursed is he who\nkeeps back his sword from blood” (Jeremiah 48:10). There are those who\nsay that Joab killed him, and there are those who say that he did not\nkill him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yoav lived hundreds of years before Yirmiyahu (Jeremiah) HaNavi. How are Yoav and his teacher bringing proofs from a text that would not be written for hundreds of years? How are we to understand this type of aggadata gemara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Tosafos (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=68&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gittin 68a, ד\"ה וכתיב</a>) addresses this very point, and refers to that episode in Bava Basra:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שזה הפסוק לא נכתב עדיין היו יודעין כמו ארור עושה מלאכת ה' רמיה בפ' לא יחפור (ב\"ב דף כא:) גבי יואב</p>\n<p>Even though the posuk hadn't yet been written, they knew [the concept] already, as with [the verse in Yirmiyah in the episode with] Yoav.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Binyomin pointed out in a comment, the Neviim didn't come to teach new ideas, but to reinforce existing ones. The idea expressed in this posuk, and similar ones quoted in such contexts, is therefore already inherent in the Torah we received from Moshe. The Gemara itself expresses this with the phrase (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=9&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taanis 9a</a>) מי איכא מידי דכתיבי בכתובי דלא רמיזי באורייתא, \"Could there be anything written in Scripture which is not hinted at in the Torah?\" (on which Rashi comments (ד\"ה ולא רמזה) that \"Chumash is the foundation of Neviim and Kesuvim, and everything in them must find its basis somewhere in the Torah\").</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Book (or section of one) about the years of the Jewish kings and their variations depending on their actions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As anyone who's learned Sefer Melachim knows, there are a lot of places where the years of the kings of Yehuda and Yisrael don't quite seem to match up. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/33272/18471\">this question</a>.) As an example, Rechavam and Yeravam began their reigns at pretty much the same time, and Rechavam ruled for 17 years, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.15.1?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Melachim 15:1</a> says that his son and successor Aviya(m) began to rule in Yeravam's 18th year (and in fact Radak there wonders why this should be so). There are still greater discrepancies elsewhere, for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.13.10?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Melachim 13:10</a>, which says that Yehoash succeeded his father Yehoachaz as king of Yisrael in the 37th year of Yehoash of Yehuda, and many of the mefarshim point out that the figures given earlier (that Yehoachaz ascended the throne in Yehoash's 23rd year, and reigned for 17 years) seemingly should yield the 39th year instead.</p>\n<p>Many years ago, as a youngster, I saw an interesting book (I vaguely remember it being connected with the Mishnah about Rosh Chodesh Nissan being \"the Rosh Hashanah for kings,\" so it might have been an appendix to a commentary on Maseches Rosh Hashanah) that goes systematically through these, and tries to explain them based on the following principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The reigns of the righteous kings were counted (as those of a Jewish king should be) from Nissan, while those of the wicked kings were counted like those of non-Jewish kings, from Tishrei.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sometimes the Sanhedrin could decide to change this in the middle of the reign, if the king did teshuvah or, conversely, became wicked.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of Yehoachaz, I recall it explaining (at least part of) the discrepancy as being due to the fact that he did some degree of teshuvah and \"beseeched Hashem\" (II Melachim 13:4), so that one of his regnal years was shortened (for example, his 16th year began in Tishrei 3098 and would have been expected to run till Elul, but instead his 17th year was considered to begin that Nissan).</p>\n<p>The book was in English, as I recall. Hard to say about the date - I might have seen it as far back as the 1980s, but definitely no later than about 1995.</p>\n<p>Based on all the above details, can anyone identify the book? I'd really like to read it again.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did the Rambam break his own rule of predicting the time of Moshiach's arrival in the Epistle of Yemen?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah</a> the Rambam states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the Sages say that Elijah will come before the coming of the Messiah. But regarding all these matters and similar, no one knows how it will be until it will be. For these matters were unclear to the Prophets. Even the Sages themselves did not have a Tradition regarding these matters and only could attempt to understand the verses. Thus, there were disagreements in these matters. Nevertheless, neither the order that these events will occur nor their details are fundamental to the religion. Thus, a person must never busy himself with the Aggadohs and not dwell on the Midrashim regarding these matters or similar issues. He must not make them dogma. For these do not result in either love (for G-d) nor fear (of sin). <strong>Similarly, one should not calculate the Ends. Our Sages have said that the spirit of those who calculate the Ends will expire.</strong> Rather, one is to (simply) wait and believe in the principle of this matter, as we have explained.\n(Emphasis Mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which appears to discourage people to calculate the time of Moshiach's arrival. However in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Iggerot_HaRambam%2C_Iggeret_Teiman.12?ven=Iggeret_Teiman&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Epistle To Yemen</a> ,the Rambam gives a prediction himself. In addition, there are <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.7.25?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Daniel.7.25.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">others</a> who also give predictions as well. How is all of this justified?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam himself addresses this in that very same epistle (speaking about R' Saadiah Gaon's prediction), after quoting the same Gemara he references in Mishneh Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואנו דנין את רב סעדיה לכף זכות ונאמר שמא מה שהביאו לעניין זה ואע\"פ שהיה יודע שהתורה אסרה זה לפי שהיו בני דורו בעלי סברות רבות נשחתות וכמעט שתאבד תורת ה' לולי הוא ע\"ה לפי שהוא גלה מן התורה מה שהיה נעלם וחזק ממנה מה שנדלדל והודיעו בלשונו ובכתבו וקולמוסו וראה בכלל מה שראה בדעתו לקבץ המון העם על דרך חשבון הקצים כדי לאמץ אותם ולהוסיף על תוחלתם והוא התכוון בכל מעשיו לשם שמים ואין לטעון עליו על שטעה בחשבונותיו כי כוונתו היה מה שאמרתי</p>\n<p>As for R. Saadia's Messianic calculations, there are extenuating circumstances for them though he knew they were disallowed. For the Jews of his time were perplexed and misguided. The Divine religion might well nigh have disappeared had he not encouraged the pusillanimous, and diffused, disseminated and propagated by word of mouth and pen a knowledge of its underlying principles. He believed, in all earnestness, that by means of the Messianic calculations, he would inspire the masses with hope for the truth. Verily all his deeds were for the sake of heaven. Consequently, in view of the probity of his motives, which we have disclosed, one must not decry him for his Messianic computations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the same would apply to a lot of the other calculations, such as Rashi's.</p>\n<p>The Rambam's own prediction, by the way, is not about the actual time of the arrival of Moshiach - he repeats, in the line before he gives his prediction, that this can't be known with precision - but about \"the future restoration of prophecy in Israel.\" Which is, as he goes on to say, \"one of the signs betokening the approach of the Messianic era\" but not its actual beginning.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't have much of a background in Hasidism, so I don't quite understand what it is.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, it's something like holy sparks that have fallen to earth. It seems to symbolize more than that, though - e.g. see <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50006&st=&pgnum=148\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> in the beginning of Parshat Behaalotcha where he discusses putting nitzotzos onto the menora, and <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50006&st=&pgnum=150&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> in Parshat Shelach where he says that nitzotzos can become embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Does anybody have further explanation? I'm looking specifically for a primary source.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://www.jcpa.org/art/jep5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> it brings the following which will serve as a good introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In line with the kabbalistic tradition, R. Israel Ba'al Shem Tov (the Besht), the founder of Hasidism, perceived everything to be infused with Divine sparks: \"It is a great principle that there are holy sparks in all there is in the world. Nothing is void of sparks, even trees and stones.\" (As related in  <strong>Besht, Zava'at ha-Rivash, photocopy (Brooklyn: Otsar Hahasidim, 1991), section 141, p. 54 (Hebrew</strong>). Many of the sayings in this book are probably not attributable to the Besht but to R. Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezeritch, his main disciple.) He further taught that such sparks are also in \"all of man's actions. Even in man's sins there are sparks resulting from the breaking of the vessels.\" This panentheistic worldview, which sees elements of the Divine in everything, should not be confused with the panthe-istic doctrine that G-d and nature are identical.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that a fundamental tenet of Chasidus is the notion that every being retains some spark of the Divine and the challenge of a Jew's existence is to unlock and access these sparks through the 'breaking of the klipot' which essentially means shrugging off the weight of materialism to pursue a more spiritually aware life. This breaking is done through our mitzvah performance which refines us with each one that we do. Rabbi Norman Lamm notes that through these acts it serves to create a 'tikkun' bringing us back to a more perfect state as seen when the world was first created. (Rabbi Norman Lamm provides a good breakdown <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8f-8ID3ZIg8C&pg=PA325&lpg=PA325&dq=%27sparks%27%20in%20hasidism&source=bl&ots=HZAHs7JjpT&sig=ACfU3U3C9CXNXiqUTjHHP2z1pg8ehv4s3w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCwKekmJ3qAhVzoVwKHY0hCqMQ6AEwBnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%27sparks%27%20in%20hasidism&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> refer to footnote 4).

It is a contemporary Sefer that serves As an introduction to learning chassidus and explains many Kabbalistic concepts in an understandable fashion.</p>\n<p>In chapter 3 he explains that during the first stage of tzimtzum (contraction) the lower 7 sefiros (vessels) broke due to the overwhelming light being filtered through them, resulting in kelipos (shells) from the shards of the vessels and nitzotzos (sparks) which are a remnant of the light that was being filtered through the vessels. There is an idea in kabbala/chassidus that we are tasked with gathering together these sparks of holiness that have fallen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I make it my goal to explain these things, in the spirit of my main teacher, Rabbi Manis Friedman, in a way that is non technical and can be understood in every day language.</p>\n<p>In life, there are many things that are exciting and powerful, but not good. Anger is a good example to work with for this. Anger is one of those aspects of life and creation that contains an energy, a passion, that itself is not bad. However, that energy and passion belong to anger, which is bad (exceptions not included).</p>\n<p>The evil and bad are going to be gone forever when Moshiach comes. Our goal, before that happens, is to rescue those energies and passions that are currently in the hands of the \"dark side\" and bring them over to the good side.</p>\n<p>Given that there are so many different \"sparks\", and each has its own character and method, it's hard to cover all bases, but I will give a couple of examples:</p>\n<p>When it comes to anger, this is one way in which we rescue its spark. Imagine a husband and wife who love each-other to the maximum degree their hearts can love. Then they have a fight, and a lot of anger comes out. When they deal with that, and make up, they love each-other <em>more</em>; more powerfully, more passionately, than they did before the fight! Where did this extra love come from? It came from the passion and energy of the anger. It has been rescued from that bad force and brought to a good purpose, just like Hashem wants!</p>\n<p>Another example is Hitler yemach shemo. He was very evil, no question. Yet there was an energy in his evil, let's call it \"insanity\", that <em>itself</em>, is not specific to evil. He was <em>insanely</em> evil. Who is <em>insanely</em> good to match Hitler? Whoever is has rescued some very powerful spark...</p>\n<p>We live in a world where evil gets all the sparks, unfortunately. The manifestation of this is that doing good is dull, boring, takes effort. Evil on the other hand is exciting, powerful, and has a lot of momentum and draw that good simply does not have.</p>\n<p>This is a result of the Kabbalistic concept of the vessels having been shattered. The normal is that good should have this type of draw, energy, momentum and excitement and evil should be dull, boring and stupid. By rescuing sparks, which is predominantly achieved through resisting temptation, and teshuva, we bring those sparks back to the good side and when the Moshiach comes we will have a world where good truly has won, and has defeated evil utterly and completely, and good itself is enhanced by this and we can enjoy the reward of that for eternity.</p>\n<p>I have based this, as mentioned on Rabbi Manis Friedman's explanations because he is an expert in both the technical chassidus and the art of translating it into every day understanding. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7EqdjpeX-Y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This shiur</a> in particular covers these points. The other answers have brought good sefarim that deal with these ideas in the original.</p>\n\n\n",

Joseph Hayyim</a> of Baghdad addresses this question.</p>\n<p>He begins with a different question: how is it possible that R. Nachman was unaware of the law that one must not talk while eating? Furthermore, how could R. Yitzchak respond? The very statement he was quoting forbids making the statement! Additionally, many great rabbis throughout the generations have not followed this law, and in fact do talk while eating.</p>\n<p>He provides two possible reasons why it would not have been problematic in this situation. The first is that this law only applied when people while leaning. In such a situation it was indeed dangerous to speak while eating, but when eating sitting upright there is no danger. R. Nachman felt justified in talking while they were eating because they weren't leaning. R. Yitzchak responded by quoting the statement of R. Yochanan. R. Yochanan's statement was short and to the point – you can't talk while eating. He didn't say that it only applies in certain situations. While a <em>tanna</em> can issue a vague pronouncement without delineating the parameters, an <em>amora</em> is obligated to explain his statements. Thus, the fact that R. Yochanan did not specify that this law is only aplicable when leaning means that it is in fact applicable even when not leaning. The reason for this is that even though it is not dangerous in such a situation, we forbid it on account of the situations where it is dangerous. R. Yitzchak felt that teaching this to R. Nachman was sufficient reason to override the secondary decree.</p>\n<p>The alternative explanation is that while it is dangerous to talk while eating, it is irrelevant when the speech is words of Torah since the <em>mitzvah</em> (of Torah study) would protect them from harm. R. Nachman therefore felt justified in engaging in a Torah conversation. R. Yitzchak however felt that even though speaking words of Torah is not dangerous it still must not be done because onlookers may not realize that it is words of Torah being spoken, and they may then think that it is okay to talk about anything while eating.</p>\n<p>This is where we get to the relevance of the statement about Yaakov not dying. R. Yitzchak was making the argument that we have to be concerned about onlookers making a mistake. He thus cited the statement about Yaakov to buttress his argument. Since they embalmed, eulogized, and buried Yaakov even though he didn't die, we see that they were concerned about the onlookers mistakenly thinking that Yaakov was a god. If so, we too must be concerned about onlookers mistakenly thinking to is fine to talk about anything while eating, and therefore we must refrain even from talking about Torah which poses no danger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Most likely due to the fact that first Rav Yitzchak quoted Rav Yochonan when he told told Rav Nachman that one should not talk when eating. Then when he finished eating, he continued to quote Rav Yochanan on another matter (Yaakov lo mes). This is not unusual in shas to string quotes of an amorah together. There are many examples in shas, here is one - Shavuous 47b Shimon be Tarfon.</p>\n<p>Without having a source, I would say further that since Rav Yitzchak quoted Rav Yochanan first to reprimand Rav Nachman, he then brought another Rav Yochanan in a more positive way as opposed to quoting another thought from someone else.</p>\n\n\n",

Inasmuch as life itself has a structure, halacha is contoured exactly to life in its entirety and beyond.

[...] Instead of Yehoyachin, placed Nevuchadretzar Matnaya, third son of Yoshiyahu, upon the throne, and changed his name to Tzidkiyahu, the same way that Pharaoh Nekho changed the name of Eliakim to Yehoyakim, probably from the same reason, to show the world that Tzidkiyahu isn't but a servant of Babylon.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems, therefore, that the name-change stemmed from want of imposing power, in particular considering that those were very restless times in the Middle East, filled with wars and rebellions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>So with regards to Doniel having his named changed to Beltshatzar -</p>\n<p>It is worth noting the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashbam_on_Genesis.41.45.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.45?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 41:45</a> when Pharoah changed Yosef's name to Tzafnas Paneach.

It means that the man who had been referred to as Hosheah son of Nun in his father’s house was the one whom Moses now referred to as Joshua. The change had occurred already at the time when Moses appointed this man to be his personal valet. <strong>It was customary to change the names of people who were promoted in rank</strong>. We find this the first time when Pharaoh changed Joseph’s name to Tzafnat Paneach (Genesis 41,45) <strong>We find it again in Daniel 1,6 when Nevuchadnezzar’s chief officer changed Daniel’s name to Belteshazzar</strong>. This had been a reference to a Babylonian idol so named.

And included in this is that just as you violate <em>bal tosif</em> by donning two head <em>tefillin</em>, since there is room on the head to be able to place two <em>tefillin</em>, you also violate <em>bal tosif</em> by donning more than one garment of <em>tzitzit</em>, since one is able to make many garments of <em>tzitzit</em> as there is no defined location set for it – whether it be on the top garment, or the bottom, or the middle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The source that you are quoting (S.A.) is saying that \"if one has multiple garments that require tzitzis and is going to put them on without any interruption between them, one only says one bracha...\"</p>\n<p>It's not referring to that one <em>should</em> be wearing multiple tzitzits but rather if one is going to put on multiple garments that require it such as a 4 cornered shirt, a 4 cornered sweater etc. One would say one bracha on all of them at once. It does not mention anything about a mitzvah to wear more than one pair tzitzis. It's not ossur but it not a mitzvah to go out of your way to do it.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, to illustrate from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7887/jewish/Chapter-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya perek Ches:</a>, first regarding the cleansing for unkosher food:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד זאת במאכלות אסורות, שלכך נקראים בשם איסור</p>\n<p>There is an additional aspect in the matter of forbidden foods, for\nwhich reason they are called issur (“bound” and attached):</p>\n<p>מפני שאף מי שאכל מאכל איסור בלא הודע, לשם שמים, לעבוד ה׳ בכח אכילה\nההיא</p>\n<p>Even if one ate a forbidden food unwittingly and his intention in\neating was for the sake of heaven, i.e., in order to serve G‑d with\nthe energy derived from it;</p>\n<p>(Had the food been permitted, the very act of eating for the sake of\nheaven would suffice to extract the good from the evil of the food’s\nvitality, as explained above. In this instance, however, forbidden\nfood was eaten for the sake of heaven.)</p>\n<p>וגם פעל ועשה כן, וקרא והתפלל בכח אכילה ההיא</p>\n<p>moreover, even if he actually carried out his intention, having\nstudied and prayed with the energy derived from that food;</p>\n<p>(Again, had the food been permitted and the person studied and prayed\nwith the energy provided by the food, the energy would be elevated to\nSanctity. But because the food was forbidden —)</p>\n<p>אין החיות שבה עולה ומתלבשת בתיבות התורה והתפלה כמו ההיתר</p>\n<p>the vitality contained in it does not ascend or become clothed in the\nwords of Torah and prayer that he studies and prays with the energy of\nthat food as is the case with permitted foods,</p>\n<p>מפני איסורה בידי הסטרא אחרא משלש קליפות הטמאות</p>\n<p>because it is held captive in the power of the sitra achra of the\nthree unclean kelipot which do not permit the energy of the food to be\nelevated to Sanctity.</p>\n<p>ואפילו הוא איסור דרבנן, שחמורים דברי סופרים יותר מדברי תורה כו׳</p>\n<p>This is so even if it is forbidden by reason of a Rabbinic\nprohibition, for1 “the words i.e., the prohibitions of the Scribes are\neven more stringent than the words of the Torah.”</p>\n<p>ולכן, גם היצר הרע וכח המתאוה לדברים האסורים הוא שד משדין נוכראין, שהוא\nיצר הרע של אומות העולם, שנפשותיהם משלש קליפות הטמאות</p>\n<p>Therefore, the yetzer hara (evil impulse) and the force that lusts\nafter forbidden things is also2 “one of the non-Jewish demons,” which\nis the yetzer hara of the nations, whose souls are derived from the\nthree unclean kelipot.</p>\n<p>They therefore lust after forbidden matters, since the forbidden\nmatters, too, derive their energy from the three unclean kelipot.</p>\n<p>מה שאין כן היצר הרע וכח המתאוה לדברים המותרים, למלאות תאותו, הוא שד\nמשדין יהודאין, לפי שיכול לחזור לקדושה כדלעיל</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the evil impulse and the craving force after\npermissible things even when done solely to satisfy one’s craving in\nwhich case, as mentioned earlier, even the permissible matter descends\ninto the utter evil of the three unclean kelipot; still it is3 “one of\nthe Jewish demons”; it is, as it were, a Jewish evil impulse, for it\n(the vitality of a permitted thing) can be reverted to holiness, as\nwas explained above.4</p>\n<p>Since the food itself is permissible, therefore, though it was eaten\nto satisfy bodily desire, it can still be elevated to holiness (when\nthe person returns to the study of Torah and the service of G‑d). The\nyetzer hara for forbidden matters, however, is intrinsically\nun-Jewish, i.e., essentially foreign to the Jew’s character. As\nexplained elsewhere, one acquires this “foreign” yetzer hara by\nimmersing himself in “permitted” pleasures. These so coarsen him that\nhe begins to lust after prohibited matters as well — a desire totally\nunnatural for the Jew.</p>\n<p>אך מכל מקום קודם שחזר לקדושה הוא סטרא אחרא וקליפה</p>\n<p>Although the vitality of permitted foods eaten out of bodily desire\ncan revert to holiness through the person’s repentance, nevertheless,\nbefore it has reverted to holiness it is sitra achra and kelipah,</p>\n<p>וגם אחר כך הרשימו ממנו נשאר דבוק בגוף</p>\n<p>and even afterwards (after the person repented and elevated the energy\nof the food to holiness) a trace of it remains attached to the\nperson’s body,</p>\n<p>להיות כי מכל מאכל ומשקה נעשה תיכף דם ובשר מבשרו</p>\n<p>since each item of food and drink that one ingests immediately becomes\nblood and flesh of his flesh.</p>\n<p>Since the food which became his flesh and blood was evil at the time\nof consumption — having been eaten for the sake of bodily pleasure — a\ntrace of the kelipah remains in the body even after the person has\nrepented and elevated the vitality of the food to holiness.</p>\n<p>ולכן צריך הגוף לחיבוט הקבר, לנקותו ולטהרו מטומאתו שקיבל בהנאת עולם הזה\nותענוגיו, מטומאת קליפת נוגה ושדין יהודאין</p>\n<p><strong>That is why the body must undergo the “Purgatory of the Grave” (a specific punishment for the body5 ) in order to cleanse it and purify\nit of the uncleanness which it had received from the enjoyment of\nmundane things and pleasures, which are from the impurity of the\nkelipat nogah and of the “Jewish demons” (i.e., the “Jewish yetzer\nhara” which desires permitted matters);</strong></p>\n<p>אלא אם כן מי שלא נהנה מעולם הזה כל ימיו</p>\n<p>unless one had never derived enjoyment from this world all his life\n(i.e., either he actually derived no enjoyment, or his enjoyment was\nnot of this world, since all his actions were completely for the sake\nof mitzvot and holiness),</p>\n<p>כרבינו הקדוש</p>\n<p>as was the case with Rabbeinu HaKadosh (Rabbi Judah the Prince, who\nsaid at the time of his demise that he had had no enjoyment of this\nworld even to the extent of his “small finger”).</p>\n<p>He who never derived pleasure from this world all his life need not\nundergo the “Purgatory of the Grave.” However, anyone who has not\nattained this level must undergo this punishment to purify his body of\nthe uncleanness received from the enjoyment of mundane pleasures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>basically, because that energy in the food was not able to be used for holiness, it was used for the \"other side\" (chas veshalom), so to rectify that the soul needs to go through a purification to get rid of all its impure desires (even if the food was kosher, but if it wasnt for the sake of heaven). Also for not studying torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We shall now learn what is necessary for the rectification of\npermitted words not spoken for the sake of heaven.</p>\n<p>ועל דברים בטלים בהיתר, כגון עם הארץ שאינו יכול ללמוד</p>\n<p>As for innocent idle chatter, such as in the case of an ignoramus who\ncannot study,</p>\n<p>He who is able to study is constantly obligated to fulfill the\ncommandment of studying Torah; for him idle chatter is prohibited.

But —</p>\n<p>צריך לטהר נפשו מטומאה זו דקליפה זו על ידי גלגולה בכף הקלע, כמו שכתוב\nבזהר, פרשת בשלח דף נ״ט</p>\n<p>he must have his soul cleansed from the impurity of this kelipah,\nthrough its being rolled in the “Hollow of a Sling,”6 as is stated in\nthe Zohar, Parshat Beshallach, p. 59.</p>\n<p>This punishment is described7 as “being slung from one end of the\nworld to the other,” or “from Israel to other lands.” The meaning of\nthis is that the soul is flung from one extreme to the other: First it\nis shown the truth and preciousness of holiness, and then it is\n“slung” into and reminded of the thoughts and words it experienced\nwhile in the physical world — a most painful experience for the soul.8</p>\n<p>אבל לדיבורים אסורים, כמו ליצנות ולשון הרע וכיוצא בהם, שהן משלש קליפות\nהטמאות לגמרי</p>\n<p>But with regard to forbidden speech, such as scoffing and slander and\nthe like, which being prohibited stem from the three completely\nunclean kelipot,</p>\n<p>אין כף הקלע לבדו מועיל לטהר ולהעביר טומאתו מהנפש</p>\n<p>the “Hollow of a Sling” (alone) does not suffice to cleanse and remove\nthe impurity of the soul,</p>\n<p>רק צריכה לירד לגיהנם</p>\n<p>but it (the soul) must descend into Gehinnom (Purgatory — which is a\ngreater punishment and thus more effective in cleansing the soul).</p>\n<p>וכן מי שאפשר לו לעסוק בתורה ועוסק בדברים בטלים</p>\n<p>So, too, with one who is able to engage in the study of Torah, but\noccupies himself instead with idle chatter —</p>\n<p>אין כף הקלע לבדו מועיל לנפשו למרקה ולזככה</p>\n<p>the “Hollow of the Sling” alone cannot effectively scour and cleanse\nhis soul,</p>\n<p>רק עונשים חמורים שמענישים על ביטול תורה בפרטות</p>\n<p>but it must receive the severe penalties which are meted out for\nneglect of the Torah in particular,</p>\n<p>מלבד עונש הכללי לכל ביטול מצוות עשה מחמת עצלות, בגיהנם של שלג, כמבואר\nבמקום אחר</p>\n<p>apart from the general retribution for the neglect of positive\ncommandments through indolence, namely the “Purgatory of Snow,” as is\nexplained elsewhere.9</p>\n<p>The purgatory (Gehinnom), where the soul is cleansed of the “stains”\nof sin so that it may enter Paradise to enjoy the radiance of G‑d’s\nglory, operates on the principle of “measure for measure,” i.e.,\npunishment in kind. Thus sins of commission caused by the heat of\npassion and lust are cleansed in a “Gehinnom (nehar, lit., ”stream“)\nof Fire,” while sins of omission, due to indolence and coolness (i.e.,\nlack of fervor), are cleansed in a “Gehinnom of Snow.”10</p>\n<p>וכן העוסק בחכמות אומות העולם בכלל דברים בטלים יחשב לענין עון ביטול\nתורה, כמו שכתוב בהלכות תלמוד תורה</p>\n<p>Occupying oneself with the sciences of the nations of the world is\nlikewise included in the category of engaging in inconsequential\nmatters insofar as the sin of neglecting the Torah is concerned, for\nin studying the sciences of the nations, too, one is guilty of\nneglecting Torah study, as is explained in the Laws of Torah Study.11</p>\n<p>ועוד זאת, יתירה טומאתה של חכמת האומות על טומאת דברים בטלים</p>\n<p>Moreover, the impurity of the science of the nations is greater than\nthe impurity of idle speech;</p>\n<p>שאינו מלביש ומטמא רק המדות מיסוד הרוח הקדוש שבנפשו האלקית</p>\n<p>for the latter clothe and defile only the emotions [which emanate]\nfrom the holy element of ruach (Air) within his divine soul,</p>\n<p>בטומאת קליפת נוגה שבדברים בטלים הבאים מיסוד הרוח הרע שבקליפה זו בנפשו\nהבהמית, כדלעיל</p>\n<p>[by tainting them] with the impurity of kelipat nogah contained in\nidle speech (which is derived from the evil element of ruach (Air,\nwhich is one of the components) of this kelipah in his animal soul),\nas mentioned above.</p>\n<p>The G‑dly soul and the animal soul are both composed of four spiritual\n“elements”: Fire, Air, Water and Earth. The emotions, such as love and\nfear, which one expresses in idle talk, emanate from the element of\nAir. Thus, idle speech defiles the emotional attributes of the divine\nsoul, which emanate from the holy element of Air, by using them in the\nservice of the animal soul’s element of Air, i.e., its emotional\nattributes — which are “impure”, since they derive from kelipat nogah.</p>\n<p>ולא בחינות חב״ד שבנפשו, מאחר שהם דברי שטות ובורות</p>\n<p>[Idle speech does] not, however, [defile] the levels of ChaBaD (the\nintellectual faculties) in his soul, for it is but words of\nfoolishness and ignorance,</p>\n<p>שגם השוטים ועמי הארץ יכולים לדבר כן</p>\n<p>since even fools and ignoramuses can speak that way.</p>\n<p>Since these are not intellectual matters, the intellect remains\nuninvolved and untainted.</p>\n<p>מה שאין כן בחכמת האומות הוא מלביש ומטמא בחינות חב״ד שבנפשו האלקית,\nבטומאת קליפת נוגה שבחכמות אלו</p>\n<p>Not so in the case of the science of the nations; thereby one clothes\nand defiles his divine soul’s faculties of ChaBaD (intellect) with the\nimpurity of the kelipat nogah contained in those sciences,</p>\n<p>שנפלו שמה בשבירת הכלים מבחינת אחוריים של חכמה דקדושה, כידוע ליודעי ח״ן</p>\n<p>whither they (the sciences) have fallen, through the “shattering of\nthe vessels,” out of the “hinder-part” of Chochmah of holiness, as is\nknown to those familiar with the Esoteric Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Thus the study of these sciences contaminates the intellectual\nfaculties of the G‑dly soul, and it is therefore much worse than idle\nspeech, which contaminates only the emotional faculties,</p>\n<p>אלא אם כן עושה אותן קרדום לחתוך בהן, דהיינו כדי להתפרנס מהן בריוח\nלעבוד ה׳</p>\n<p>unless one employs them (these sciences) as a useful instrument, viz.,\nas a means of earning a more affluent livelihood with which to be able\nto serve G‑d,</p>\n<p>או שיודע להשתמש בהן לעבודת ה׳ או לתורתו</p>\n<p>or unless he knows how to apply them (the sciences) in the service of\nG‑d or to his better understanding of His Torah; e.g., he utilizes\nmathematics to better understand the laws of the Sanctification of the\nNew Moon.</p>\n<p>וזהו טעמו של הרמב״ם ורמב״ן ז״ל וסיעתן שעסקו בהן</p>\n<p>This is the reason why Maimonides and Nachmanides, of blessed memory,\nand their peers, engaged in them (in the sciences — since they were\nable to utilize this knowledge in the service of G‑d and Torah).</p>\n<p>Regarding that which was stated at the beginning of this chapter that\na thing prohibited even by Rabbinic enactment remains attached to the\nthree unclean kelipot and cannot be elevated to holiness, even when it\nis used unwittingly and for the sake of heaven (i.e., in order to have\nstrength to study and pray), — the following story is worth relating:</p>\n<p>A chassid once came to the Alter Rebbe lamenting the fact that his\nson-in-law was subject to periods when he would doubt his faith.

However, only a portion of the prophecies were recorded, because only prophecy that was needed for future generations was written down in the Bible for posterity, but that which was not needed, as it was not pertinent to later generations, was not written.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A simple reading of the passage would seem to imply that these prophets prophesied to Israel. We know no other details about them, because their prophecies were not pertinent for later generations.</p>\n\n\n",

According to\nAshkenazim, many authorities forbid boarding a ship that will travel\non Shabbat unless one boards the boat during the first three days of\nthe week (Sunday through Tuesday), however, some permit boarding on\nFriday. According to Sephardim, many authorities hold that one may not\nboard a boat within 3 days of Shabbat, meaning, preferably during the\nfirst three days of the week and if that’s not possible then even on\nWednesday. However, some say that one is permitted to board a\ncruise/boat even on Friday. <a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Taking_a_cruise_over_Shabbat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>This is all on condition that the\ncaptain and crew are non-Jewish and that a majority of the passengers\nare non-Jewish. <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2753\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a> If the ship is owned by Jews, consult your local\nRabbi. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22650/does-amirah-lakum-apply-to-robots\">3</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>those notes are relevant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>The Gemara Shabbat 19a quotes the Briatta which states that one may\nnot board a boat in order to travel on Shabbat unless one got on\nbefore 3 days before Shabbat (whether or not this includes Wednesday\nwill be addressed later). The Rif (Shabbat 7a-b) explains that the\nreason for this restriction is that if one boards a boat within 3 days\nof Shabbat it will negatively impact the passenger’s oneg Shabbat\n(enjoyment of Shabbat), however, if it’s started earlier the\npassengers will get used to it and be able to enjoy Shabbat. The Rif\nadds that if the boat will travel lower than 10 Tefachim (to the\nground of the river) there could be a violation of leaving the Techum\nand in such a case one wouldn’t be able to leave any day of the week.\nThe Rosh (Shabbat 1:38) and Rambam (Shabbat 30:13) agree with this\nreason. However, the Baal HaMoer (on Rif) explains that the reason\nthat one may not board a boat close to Shabbat is because it is likely\nthat there will be life threatening danger which will necessitate a\nviolation of Shabbat. However, when one enters the boat before 3 days\nbefore Shabbat, there’s no issue because the obligation to prepare not\nto violate Shabbat even for life threatening danger doesn’t begin\nsince the beginning of the week is not considered relevant to the\nupcoming Shabbat (Mishna Brurah’s introduction to 248 and Mishna\nBrurah 248:8). The Bet Yosef 248:1 writes that according to the Baal\nHaMoer it seems that it would be forbidden to board the boat on\nWednesday because Gemara Gittin 77a says that Sunday through Tuesday\nis part of the previous Shabbat and Wednesday to Friday is connected\nto the upcoming Shabbat. Then the Bet Yosef infers from the Rosh that\nit is permissible to board the boat on Wednesday. Mishna Brurah 248:8\nwrites that this question of whether Wednesday is a major dispute\nbetween the Magen Avraham who forbids and the Gra who permits and\nMishna Brurah leaves it unresolved. Shemirat Shabbat KeHilchata 30:66\nis strict only to allow entering the boat before Wednesday. Kaf\nHaChaim 248:7 writes that preferably one should be strict not to board\non Wednesday but if it’s not possible one can be lenient. Menuchat\nAhava (vol 1, 1:1-2) is lenient to permit entering on Wednesday unless\nit’s definite that there will be a violation of Shabbat (because life\nthreatening situations).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Menuchat Ahava (vol 1, 1:2) writes that</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>nowadays since the boats are calmer and it’s less likely that it will\nruin one’s oneg Shabbat it’s permissible to board the boat on Friday.\nRabbi Yisrael Belsky (OU Kosher Webcast, December 2011, min 3-9) says\nthat nowadays the minhag is to be lenient and there is what to rely\non. However, Shemirat Shabbat KeHilchata 30:66 rules that trips for\nvacation may only board the ship on the first three days of the week\neven nowadays. (Rav Herschel Schachter (min 77) seems to agree.)\nVeDaber Davar (Rav Shmuel Pinchasi, 1:25), Chut Sheni (Rav Nassim\nKarlitz, vol 1, pg 72), and Daily Halacha by Rabbi Mansour agree with\nShemirat Shabbat KeHilchata. Similarly, Yalkut Yosef (Shabbat vol 1,\npg 48) argues that one should not be lenient unless one frequently\ntravels by boat and isn’t bothered by the travel. Menuchat Ahava (vol\n1, 1:2) writes that if the crew or captain is Jewish and will work on\nShabbat it’s forbidden to board the boat any day of the week. Yalkut\nYosef (Shabbat, vol 1, pg 48), Sh”t Yechave Daat 6:16, and VeDaber\nDavar (Rav Shmuel Pinchasi 1:22) agree. Menuchat Ahava (vol 1, 1:2)\nwrites that it is only permissible if a majority of the passengers are\nnon-Jewish, otherwise, the crew is working on Shabbat for the benefit\nof Jewish and would be forbidden (as Amirah LeNochri). Shemirat\nShabbat KeHilchata 30:66 (and note 221) adds if the ship travels on a\nschedule and would travel with or without passengers then it would be\npermissible even if there’s a majority of Jews, but if without the\nJewish passengers they would cancel the trip it wouldn’t be forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and note 3:\nShemirat Shabbat KeHilchata 33:66 (not 222) writes that one should consult a Rabbi. See also <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/eng/?id=5290\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/eng/?id=5290</a> who expressly forbids if it's owned by Jews.</p>\n<p>although that link no longer works... but still seems to be dependant on if the ship is run by jews or not, so in this case of the sailboat, it would be a jew runnning it the whole time...</p>\n<p>but all of this is regarding actually getting onto the boat, not just being on the boat (assuming one went on it sunday or even tuesday, for sure), you mentioned doing work such as \"tie knots and pull the ropes of the sails\" <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2753\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">knot tying is problematic on shabbos</a>, in fact that source explicitly mentions knots being tied for the sake of sailing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one ties a “permanent” knot on Shabbat, i.e. a knot that is not\nmeant to be undone within the next day or the next week (as we shall\nsoon explain), if this knot is “professionally done”, i.e. not all\nindividuals know how to tie such a knot, for it takes certain\nknowledge and skill to tie such a knot, one is liable by Torah law as\na result of the knot he has tied, similar to any other form of Shabbat\ndesecration.</p>\n<p>An example of a knot forbidden on Shabbat by Torah law is a\n“Camel-Driver’s Knot.” This entailed making a hole in the saddle or\nthrough the camel’s nose through which leather straps would be passed\nand tied strongly such that it would never become untied. This kind of\nknot is considered both “permanent” and “professional.” For this\nreason, one who ties such a knot on Shabbat is liable by Torah law.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a “sailor’s knot,” i.e. when rope is inserted in a hole\nlocated in the front of a ship and tied very tightly so that it is\nfirm enough to tie another rope to it to hold the boat in place in the\ndock, is considered a “permanent” and “professional” knot and is\nforbidden to be tied on Shabbat by Torah law. In the next Halacha we\nshall discuss several knots which are permitted by Torah law to be\ntied on Shabbat but forbidden by a rabbinic enactment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although technically that was talking about tying it into the <strong>dock</strong>, which implies after sailing, but it <strong>may</strong> not apply (at least on the <strong>Torah</strong> level) if its tied temporarily to steer the boat, but if you look at the next halacha in that page, it discusses knots which are forbidden to be tied by rabbinic decree, which include knots taht are \"professionally done\", even if they're not permanent:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knots Forbidden by Rabbinic Enactment: Permanent or Professional Knots\nOur Sages enacted that even if a knot is not tied in a professional\nmanner, it is forbidden to be tied on Shabbat if it is permanent. This\nmeans that even if this knot can be tied by anyone and requires no\nspecial skill, nevertheless, if it is a permanent knot, one may not\ntie it. (Shulchan Aruch Chapter 317, Section 1)</p>\n<p>An example of such a knot would be the knot tied to the pail hanging\nat the top of a well. Since the knot tied to the pail is never undone,\nalthough tying such a knot requires no specific skill, it is forbidden\nto tie it on Shabbat by rabbinic law.</p>\n<p>Similarly, regarding a knot tied to a bit around an animal’s mouth,\nalthough no special skill is required to tie the bit, it is forbidden\nto tie such a knot on Shabbat if one never intends to untie it.</p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, if a knot is “professionally done” and requires some</strong>\n<strong>skill to tie it, although it is not permanent, one may not tie such a</strong>\n<strong>knot on Shabbat as a result of a rabbinic enactment.</strong></p>\n<p>Knots Permitted to be Tied on Shabbat A knot which is neither\nprofessional nor permanent may indeed be tied on Shabbat, for our\nSages only decreed not to tie a knot which fits either one of the\nTorah’s two criteria to forbid tying a knot on Shabbat, i.e. either it\nis a professional knot or a permanent one. However, a knot which is\nneither professional nor permanent may be tied on Shabbat. We shall\ndiscuss this matter further in the following Halacha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So even if its not permanent, but if its still done in a professional manner it seems to be forbidden by rabbinic decree.</p>\n<p>So this is assuming the first part of the question, but the last part of \"what if its all on autopilot\" implies the sailor would be doing no actual work with the sails at all, which then depends on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10358/may-one-use-a-computer-script-or-robot-to-do-something-specifically-on-shabbos-y\">whether or not its permitted to use computers</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10358/may-one-use-a-computer-script-or-robot-to-do-something-specifically-on-shabbos-y\">or robots</a> to do melacha for someone on shabbos, which, according to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (as quoted there), is in general only permitted for lights...</p>\n\n\n",

For if there were other obligatory parts of Torah study not included in these three, the Talmud would not instruct us to only split our time into three parts. And even if one were to argue that the Talmud might perhaps be speaking imprecisely and there may be other aspects of Torah study not listed, when we look at Rambam's codification of this law it is even clearer. Rambam gives precise details as to how the day breaks down; he gives as an example one who works three hours per day and studies nine hours per day. He explains that the nine hours should be divided, with three hours being spent on each area of study. Such a division clearly uses up all allocated time for Torah study; hence, if there was something else obligatory it would have to be included here.</p>\n<p>The Talmud does not go into detail about the composition of these three divisions. However, if we turn again to Rambam's codification of this law (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=170\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Talmud Torah 1:11-12</a>), we find it described in much greater detail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחייב לשלש את זמן למידתו שליש בתורה שבכתב ושליש בתורה שבעל פה ושליש יבין וישכיל אחרית דבר מראשיתו ויוציא דבר מדבר וידמה דבר לדבר ויבין במדות שהתורה נדרשת בהן עד שידע היאך הוא עיקר המדות והיאך יוציא האסור והמותר וכיוצא בהן מדברים שלמד מפי השמועה וענין זה הוא הנקרא גמרא</p>\n<p>כיצד היה בעל אומנות והיה עוסק במלאכתו שלש שעות ביום ובתורה תשע אותן התשע קורא בשלש מהן בתורה שבכתב ובשלש בתורה שבעל פה ובשלש אחרות מתבונן בדעתו להבין דבר מדבר ודברי קבלה בכלל תורה שבכתב הן ופירושן בכלל תורה שבעל פה והענינים הנקראים פרדס בכלל הגמרא הן</p>\n<p>A person is obligated to divide his study time in three: one third should be devoted to the Written Law; one third to the Oral Law; and one third to understanding and conceptualizing the ultimate derivation of a concept from its roots, inferring one concept from another and comparing concepts, understanding [the Torah] based on the principles of Biblical exegesis, until one appreciates the essence of those principles and how the prohibitions and the other decisions which one received according to the oral tradition can be derived using them. The latter topic is called Gemara.</p>\n<p>How is the above expressed? A person who is a craftsman may spend three hours each day involved in his work, and [devote] nine hours to Torah study: In those nine hours, he should spend three reading the Written Law; three, the Oral Law; and three, meditating with his intellect to derive one concept from another.</p>\n<p>The \"words of the prophetic tradition\" are considered part of the Written Law; and their explanation, part of the Oral Law. The matters referred to as Pardes are considered part of the Gemara.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910973/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can apparently conclude, then, that anything that doesn't fall under this rubric is not obligatory Torah study.</p>\n<p>(Cf. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/17259/on-what-subjects-does-one-say-birchas-hatorah/88194#88194\">what form of study requires a blessing</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, Chometz on Pesach, Yayin Nesech (wine used in idol worship) and meat with milk.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, food that is not certified as kosher may indeed be kosher or non-kosher in a (relatively) minor way. If you eat non-kosher beef it would be, as stated in other answers, likely considered wrong to say a Bracha on it under most circumstances. But if you drink something nominally kosher - for example, fruit juice that is not certified kosher but which is <em>likely</em> to be kosher, it <em>may</em> be appropriate to make a Bracha on the juice.</p>\n<p>To put it another way, the question may have two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Definitively non-kosher/forbidden food (e.g., non-kosher beef (non-Shechitah, or from forbidden parts of the animal or not soaked/salted))</li>\n<li>Not certified kosher (and not \"default kosher\" like water, fresh fruits & vegetables, etc.) but not <em>inherently</em> non-kosher</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No.  The Shulchan Aruch, Orach Hayyim 196:1, says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one ate a forbidden item (even it is forbidden only by the sages), one cannot make a zimun on it or say a blessing on it, neither before or after it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It means <em>mouth of a snake</em>. The name is broken into two Hebrew words פי - mouth, נחש - snake / divination. It is difficult to understand why parents would give such a name to their son. Notwithstanding that in proper names the Hebrew letters ס,שׁ,שׂ are interchanged, the Hebrew word for snake is written with שׁ and the name Pinchas is written with ס.</p>\n<p>R' Gorr relates the story of Zimri at the end of Parashas Balak and concludes, that the name is the symbol of one who defends the honor of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likely, the conclusion can also be said in Hebrew as פי שאין הנחש משל בו. I.e. when a person truly defends the honor of G-d, the Nahash - the snake - who brought death for humanity cannot rule over him. According to tradition Pinhas who became Eliyahu had never died.</p>\n<p>R' Gorr's <em>chidush</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another breakdown of the name is also possible. פין - face, חס - compassion.

It is not impossible that his original name was פנחס, but that since his emergence the י has been added to his name to make it פי נחס, נחס, equivalent to נחץ, to say: \"<strong>my mouth, the mouth of God, has driven him</strong>\", the pure zeal for God's word was the motive for his deed, קנא .בקנאו את קנאתי (see Bereshit 26:14 and Shmot 20:5). Significant is בקנאו, in its form Piel, without Dagesh in Nun, thus written in a Kal-like manner. While קנֵא in Piel means the expression, the exercise of the legal claim that one \"takes on\", קנא in Kal would express more the attitude that appropriates the cause of another, makes it \"one's own\", takes it to heart as one's own, and this very Kal spelling here says that <em>Pinchas' act was not a mere external display, but had sprung from deep within his inner attitude, with which he felt a betrayal of God's cause as a betrayal of his own</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, they don't report an answer - how did the Jews fulfill this mitzva after matan Torah in the Wilderness? (If there was no obligation to give tzedaka, then what was the Kotzer Rebbe's question?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>On \"Shrub is burning in Kotzk\" (סנה בוער בקוצק), The Kotzker also gives the answer to his still-shocked teacher:</p>\n<p>\"The Israelites did <em>tzadaka</em> (charity) with <em>Da'at</em> (knowledge)\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I can think of two ways that one could have fulfilled the mitzvah of tzedaka back then.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If one knew someone who needed to travel away from where klal yisroel was encamped and since the manna would have spoiled the next day (and they wouldn't get manna where one was travelling on the way) so giving them some money would be considered tzedaka see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.253?lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">shulchan aruch: someone who normally has means but is traveling and is in need during the trip</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One could have donated to the mishkan or another public need and that would be tzedaka.

See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%98_%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">gemarah succah 49b</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I saw somewhere that the Gerrer Rebbe also asks this question. He answer that there is a Midrash that the Manna tasted like whatever one imagined. Many Israelites in Egypt had experienced a limited repertoire of foods. So those who had eaten an unusual food could share their recollections. In a way they gave charity.\nWhich shows us that charity is not only material it is also charity, Tzedakah, when we share our imagination with someone.</p>\n\n\n",

Our brains are limited and when an timeless and limitless entity \"does something\" all we can do is try to match it up to our limited understanding but that does not do justice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Seifer haYetzhirah, creation is made of words. And in Hebrew too, the word for speech when we are focusing on ideas is \"דבר - <em>dibbur</em>\", the same root as the word for \"thing\" -- \"דבר - <em>davar</em>\".</p>\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov says that the first chapter of Bereishis uses the metaphor of Hashem speaking for a reason. One writes the written word, and then it continues to exist on the page. A spoken word exists as long as it is being spoken. If there is still light, it is because Hashem is still saying (as it were) \"<em>Yehi Or</em> - Let there be light!\". In fact, <em>dibbur</em> of \"<em>Yehi Or</em>\" is the <em>davar</em> we perceive as light.</p>\n<p>Flipping to what most people think of as the far side of Jewish Thought from the Baal Shem Tov....</p>\n<p>In the Rambam's model (Yesodei haTorah ch. 2) Hashem had a Thought, which had a thought, etc... A chain of intellects that runs down the various classes of angel through the spheres, and eventually down to us. Stating that idea in the words I established above, Hashem's <em>dibbur</em> is a <em>medabeir</em> (\"speaker\") which therefore itself has a <em>dibbur</em>… And so on down to the physical <em>devarim</em> (things) of this world.</p>\n<p>In Qabbalah's model, the Or Ein Sof (the Light of the Infinite One / the Infinite Light) \"descends\" from world to world, getting implemented in ever more coarse forms.</p>\n<p>I feel a need to buttress the presumption that we can use the Seifer haYetzirah, which reads like a mystical text but had rationalist interpreters like Rav Saadia Gaon, the Baale Shem Tov and the Rambam as description of the same ideas in different terminologies. Since, as I noted, people think of them as opposite sides of the Mystic - Rationalist spectrum. However, the Leshem (Rav Shelomo Elyashiv, 1841-1926, not to be confused with his grandson R' Yosef Shalom), in his Kelalim, argues that the similarities are there because these are indeed two different models of same Truth. And he manages to write a work of the Vilna Gaon's school of Qabbalah that regularly buttresses its points with citations from the Rambam's Moreh Nevuchim, Hilkhos Yesodei haTorah, and other writings.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The verses in Bereishis show <em>Hashem said</em>. This means that it was a direct command by Hashem to cause the creation. That means that the original creation was accomplished by Hashem Himself and not via agents. Once the Shabbos was complete, the universe continued according to the laws that were created during the days of creation.</p>\n<p>As an example, Rah Hirsch excplains the word ברא as meaning</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So that ברא means bringing something into reality which hitherto had\nonly existed inwardly, in the mind. It is creating something purely out\nof ones mind and will and out of nothing else. It is the real יש מאין,\nand is accordingly only used for creation by Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, each <em>day</em> of creation shows that it was accomplished by וידבר by a specific command, not by a command to an agent.</p>\n\n\n",

So it was his personal choice to gun a-blazing (okay, \"swords a-blazing\") into heavily-fortified enemy territory, and his death was a direct, non-miraculous, consequence of that. Apparently R' Shimon feels that qualifies as \"he died by his own sin.\"</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I always understood that \"he died by his own sin\" is opposed to \"died because he question Moshe and Aharon (Korach and his group)\"</p>\n\n\n",

Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't believe there is an answer specific to your question, other than to say Elijah is beloved because he is the harbinger of the Messiah, and so is frequently invoked in our tradition to perform many tasks:</p>\n<p>-<strong>During Havdalah</strong>, at the conclusion of Shabbat, we sing the song Eliahu HaNavi, asking Elijah to come and bring the Messiah with him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eliahu hanavi... Bimhera veyamenu yavo elenu, ‘im Mashiach ben David. -- Elijah the Prophet… May he come to us soon, in our day, with the Messiah, the son of David.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-In the <strong>Birkat HaMazon</strong>, the Grace after Meals, we also ask for Elijah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָרַחֲמָן, הוּא יִשְׁלַח לָֽנוּ אֶת אֵלִיָּֽהוּ הַנָּבִיא זָכוּר לַטּוֹב, וִיבַשֶּׂר לָֽנוּ בְּשׂוֹרוֹת טוֹבוֹת יְשׁוּעוֹת וְנֶחָמוֹת -- May the All-Merciful One send us Elijah the Prophet, may he be remembered for good, and may he announce to us news of goodness, salvation, and comfort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-On <strong>Pessah</strong>, Ashkenazic Jews reserve a seat and a cup of wine for Elijah, and even open the door of the house for him, hoping he will show up.</p>\n<p>-Elijah <strong>“attends” all circumcisions</strong>. Here is why.  When Elijah was hiding in a cave, God visited him and asked him “Why are you here, Elijah?”  [1Kings 19:9]  He replied:\nI am moved by zeal for the Lord, the God of Hosts, for the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant [brit], torn down Your altars, and put Your prophets to the sword. I alone am left, and they are out to take my life. [1Kings 19:10, 14]\nGod resented Elijah for badmouthing Israel.  The Zohar says: God said to [Elijah:]…  The mouth that accused Israel of forsaking the covenant shall testify that they are observing it.  [Zohar 1:93a]</p>\n<p>So the rabbis decreed that Elijah would be present at every circumcision to satisfy himself that the Jews indeed fulfill that commandment.  The Midrash says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hence the sages instituted (the custom) that people should have a seat of honor for [Elijah at every circumcision]; for Elijah, may he be remembered for good, is called the Messenger of the Covenant, as it is said [in Malachi]: The messenger of the covenant [brit], that you desire, is coming. [Mal. 3:1] [Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer 29].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-Elijah is said to <strong>reappear frequently</strong>, sometimes in disguise, to help people in distress and make peace between individuals.  Talmud offers many tales of his reappearances. [E.g., B. B. 59b, Shab. 33b, B. M. 83b–84a, Sanh. 98a] One time, the Romans were pursuing Rabbi Meir.  Elijah came disguised as a prostitute and embraced Rabbi Meir.  The Romans saw this and concluded, “This cannot be Rabbi Meir.  He would never act that way.” [Av. Zar. 18b]</p>\n<p>-Elijah will <strong>settle every outstanding dispute</strong> on Jewish law. [E.g., Ber. 35b, Ed. 8:7, Men. 45a, Bek. 24a] In the Talmud, unresolved difficulties are frequently followed by the word Teku (תיקוּ), “let it stand,” which is said to be an acronym for Tishbi yetareẓ kushyot u-ve’ayot -- “the Tishbite [Elijah] will resolve difficulties and problems.”</p>\n<p>My list is not exhaustive.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone have source for this?</p>\n<p>The only thing I could find was \"R’ Pinchas said: “Through prayer we re-create the angel MeTaT every day anew. Therefore, one must be very careful not to skip a single word from the prayer, and every word must be said slowly and with concentration. And if, Heaven forbid, a person swallows the words and skips, he has created a demon … he has created a kind of angel without hands or feet, and then his body hurts him and he experiences all kinds of suffering, because that crippled angel that he created pursues him. … the letters of the prayer are chambers that are very far from one another, which is why it is so very difficult to pray. Because, really, a person is very far from true prayer. … Therefore, there is no need to look forward to any other experience of vitality than to just say the words slowly, even in a dry way, until eventually he will slowly warm up and feel more enthusiastic. (Therefore, someone who comes in the middle of the prayer has already lost out on so much, because the rest of the minyan started an hour earlier and has already managed to warm up.

The fact is that there is no marriage contract and wedding in which contentiousness does not arise, as there is inevitably some conflict between the parties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does this \"contentiousness\" mean practically speaking when two families and their children come together peacefully to the chuppah with no conflict?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tosfos in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Ketubot.2a.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos(2a says)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ליום הרביעי - ולא בליל חמישי כדאמר בפרק בתרא דנדה (דף סה:) דליכא כתובה דלא רמו בה תיגרא כ\"ש אם יעשה נשואין בליל ה' דאיכא למיחש שיטרד בנשואין וכתובה ולא יבעול:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the sefaria translation accurately explains the tosfos, as was explained by my rebbi in yeshiva when we learned this gemara: (the translation was \"Merged from 'Tosafot, Translated by Jan Buckler', 'Tosafot, Translated by Jan Buckler.', and 'Sefaria Community Translation'\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Wednesday. In the secular calendar Wednesday night is the period\nthat begins after the period of daytime on Wednesday. The Torah does\nnot have names for the days of the week. They are referred to by\nnumber, first, second etc. In B’raishis 1, 5, the Torah says: and\nthere was night and there was day, the first day. This teaches us that\nin the Torah calendar night precedes day. What is referred to as\nWednesday night in the secular calendar is caller the fifth night in\nthe Torah calendar.Our Mishna says that a vbetulah is married on the\nfourth day. Tosfos comments: But not on the fifth night (Wednesday\nnight), as the Gemara says in Needoh (65b), there is no marriage\ncontract where there is no dispute about the terms of the agreement\nand time is always needed to settle the disputes.1Nowadays we use a\nstandard marriage contract for all. During the period of the Mishna\neach marriage contract was negotiated individually. All contained the\nminimal requirements of the sages, but there was much more to be\nnegotiated. This could have drawn out for a very long period and by\nthe time it was over, the couple may not have time to consummate the\nmarriage that night.Certainly, if the marriage is made on the fifth\nnight, one needs to be concerned that one will be involved with the\nterms of the marriage and the contract and he may not have relations\nwith his bride during that night. He may postpone his relations with\nher till the next night and will first be able to present his claim of\nlack of virginity on the following Monday. By that time his anger may\nhave cooled and he may not complain to the court at all. It is\nimperative that the marriage take place Wednesday afternoon, so that\nhe will definitely have relations with his bride that evening and if\nshe is found not to be a virgin, he will still be angry when the court\nis in session Thursday morning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did not look into where this explanation comes from, but I'd assume that if two people explained it the same exact way, it probably came from somewhere.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The gemara is comparing things like bris milah (a mitzvah accepted with simcha) to things like marriage (where the relevant mitzvos were not accepted happily). Perhaps we forget how remarkable it is that our holy nation is able to do a bris milah with joy. Someone might easily recoil and say, What! - how is it possible to do that to a helpless baby?! We didn't say that. From our very beginnings we turned away from our feelings and joyously did the will of our Creator to bring our sons into their covenant with G-d.  It is almost as if we turned off that part of our yetzer hara; it no longer even seems difficult to us.<br />\nMarriage was different. When we were given the laws of arayos, instead of saying, Our purpose in getting marriage is to create families to serve our Creator, so <i>of course</i> we don't want to be married to someone when our Creator says no. No problem!<br />\nWe didn't do that. We were בוכה למשפחותיו (Bamidbar 11:10), \"crying about their [forbidden] families\". Our purpose in getting married was still our own desires, not Hashem's desires, and we were unhappy when the new mitzvos told us to do differently.  As a result, marriages are hard to do, since all the families and people involved have their own desires which will never completely align.<br />\nI guess it didn't have to be that way. It could have been that we gave away that part of our yetzer hara with joy as we did with bris milah. Marriage would have been a way of serving G-d through our families. Why would we quarrel? It's not about us! Let's all work it out together to make sure that the resulting new family is best prepared to build a bais neeman b'yisrael.<br />\nBoruch Hashem, many couples and their families do have exactly that attitude. It doesn't take away all the stress and issues with shidduchim, but it surely helps.</p>\n\n\n",

The idea expressed in the first passage is the idea behind the ability to recite <em>kidush</em> (for example) for another even if I've already fulfilled by personal obligation to recite <em>kidush</em>: because he hasn't, I'm considered to also be responsible for the fulfillment of the command, so I can recite <em>kidush</em> for him.

The Jewish people undertook the responsibility to watch out for each other.</p>\n<p>The second source isn't focused on the people doing the sin. It's not the same mitzvah a \"tochacha\", rebuke. That is a mitzvah to rebuke and correct my fellow Jew- as the verse states <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 19:17</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־תִשְׂנָ֥א אֶת־אָחִ֖יךָ בִּלְבָבֶ֑ךָ הוֹכֵ֤חַ תּוֹכִ֙יחַ֙\nאֶת־עֲמִיתֶ֔ךָ וְלֹא־תִשָּׂ֥א עָלָ֖יו חֵֽטְא׃</p>\n<p>You shall not hate your <strong>kinsfolk</strong> in your heart.

There's a mitzvah to protest evil being done in the world.<br />\nThis obligation is not out of concern for the individual, but for the resulting chillul Hashem cause by sin. Thus even for those people for whom I have no need to rebuke (\"the whole world\" who are clearly not my kinsmen), I still need to protest- to avoid being part of his chillul Hashem.</p>\n<p>This point is discussed a lot in conjunction to chillul shabbos here in Israel. By making a public rally against cars driving in religious neighborhoods, it might fulfill the mitzvah of machaah-protest but it will not fulfill the concept of tochacha-rebuke.\nBy reaching out to individual drivers, in a nice way, it might be a fulfillment of tochaha but generally you'll need to avoid making a public statement of protest. There's lots discussion regarding how to determine which approach to take.\nI've heard lots of oral discussion on this point. They all quote Ritva, which I looked up in his commentary once (I think on maseches beitza, in the sugya of \"mutav yehiyu shoggegim\", but I can't check it now) who discusses this issue.</p>\n<p>The point is that the two concepts are very different conceptually, and come from different sources, even though there may practically be some overlap.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The is a not so subtle difference.</p>\n<p>In gemara <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%98_%D7%90#fn_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rosh hashana 29a</a>, rashi states \"אע\"פ שיצא מוציא - שהרי כל ישראל ערבין זה בזה למצות:\"</p>\n<p>There is a whole \"sugya\" (topic) as to what extent a jew is responsible for another jew keeping mitzvos.

Therefore, those who stayed behind were perhaps never included in the mitzvah. Once they conquered Eretz Yisroel, it could be, that Ever Hayarden was included as part of the mitzvah, as evident in the fact that a husband can't force his wife to move from Ever Hayarden to Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Netziv in Haamak Davar on this passuk, (Bamidbar 33:51) says something along these lines.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי אתם עוברים את הירדן וגו׳. אבל כ״ז שלא עברו את הירדן לא״י לא הוזהרו להאביד ע״ז בעה״י. דאזהרה זו היא משום קדושת הארץ. ואין עה״י מתקדש אלא אחר שנתקדש א״י כמו לענין ערי מקלט שאינן קולטות עד שיהיו נגמר גם בא״י משום דערי מקלט תלוי בקדושת הארץ בזמן שהיובל נוהג. ויובל תלוי בזמן שכל ישראל על אדמתם וע׳ להלן ל״ה י׳ ומש״ה לא הוזהרו לבער ע״ז מעה״י עד שיטהרו מא״י:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you cross. As long as they had not yet crossed the Yardein into Eretz Yisroel, they were not ordered to destroy the idol worship on the other side of the Yardein. This commandment depended on the holiness of the Land of Israel; the other side of the Yardein did not become sanctified until Eretz Yisroel was sanctified. This is similar to the concept of the Cities of Refuge that did not take in accidental murderers until those in Eretz Yisroel would also be sanctified, because the activation of the Cities of Refuge depends on the holiness of Eretz Yisroel which in turn is only when the Jubilee year is being observed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would also answer why, as mentioned in the comments, the Pesukim seem to say that Ever Hayarden was not counted as Eretz Yisroel while Moshe was alive, but today (or anytime after kivush haaretz) it is considered to have some kind of status of kedushas Haaretz.</p>\n\n\n",

So we end up dividing the maftir and the haftorah with a kaddish despite it's not ideal. On shabbat morning one can add an extra aliyah so we do not need to do this split.</p>\n\n\n",

According to this explanation, a person should not perform mitzvos in an unhealthy OCD-like manner, rather the mitzvos should be done in a wholesome <em>Derech Eretz</em> manner. Does this interpretation of <em>V'Chai Bahem</em> have an authoritative source ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To start with, both the first and second interpretations of vechai bahem are non-literal explanations. Literal is that you should live your lives by the rules laid out by the mitzvot, or that by following these rules, you will have the reward of life as opposed to the penalty of the opposite. So you are actually asking about a logical extension of the first non-literal explanation.</p>\n<p>In terms of using \"veChai bahem\" as an answer to an OCD like approach, you might search for the term \"scrupulosity\" (which is how OCD is channeled improperly into religious acts, such as making sure you have a guf naki, or repeating prayer until you have proper intent), along with וחי בהם, and you will find e.g. Chana David's article which try to make such a claim.</p>\n<p>For an authoritative source, you might consider <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19398822/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Nachman of Breslov</a>, \"who declared that he himself suffered from excessive religious practices typical of religious OCD until he overcame them\".</p>\n<p>Rav Nachman makes of the pasuk of \"vechai bahem\" regarding being improperly, and overly scrupulous, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan%2C_Part_II.44.1.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Moharan, part ii, 44:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַל אֵלּוּ הַמְדַקְדְּקִים וּמַחְמִירִים בְּחֻמְרוֹת יְתֵרוֹת, עֲלֵיהֶם נֶאֱמַר (ויקרא י״ח:ה׳): וְחַי בָּהֶם, וְלֹא שֶׁיָּמוּת בָּהֶם, (יומא פה:) כִּי אֵין לָהֶם שׁוּם חִיּוּת כְּלָל, וְתָמִיד הֵם בְּמָרָה שְׁחֹרָה, מֵחֲמַת שֶׁנִּדְמֶה לָהֶם שֶׁאֵינָם יוֹצְאִים יְדֵי חוֹבָתָם בְּהַמִּצְווֹת שֶׁעוֹשִׂין, וְאֵין לָהֶם שׁוּם חִיּוּת מִשּׁוּם מִצְוָה מֵחֲמַת הַדִּקְדּוּקִים וְהַמָּרָה שְׁחֹרוֹת שֶׁלָּהֶם (וְהוּא בְּעַצְמוֹ אֵינוֹ מַחְמִיר שׁוּם חֻמְרָא כְּלָל):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, concerning those who are exacting and unnecessarily strict it is said: “and live through them” (Leviticus 18:5), and not to die by them (Yoma 85b).

This question is also related to having different lengths of strings in the tzitzit and I'll explain why. In both the Magen Avraham Orach Chaim Siman 11:14 and the Mishneh Beruah Siman 11 Seif Katan 68 they quote the Rosh who says, שיהיו כל החוליות בשוה שזהו נוי ציצית, that all the strongs should be equal in length because that's the beauty of the tzitzit. We see that having the length of the strings should be equal, to show the beauty of the tzitzit which is similar to the concept of זה א-לי ואנוהו. There should be no difference with regard to the thickness because it would be the same halacha, and we would apply the above idea. Therefore it seems to be okay to wear such a begged, but you should be aware of this concept of זה אלי ואנוהו. I’m not telling you what you should do, but making you aware of the details of your case, so please ask your LOR.</p>\n\n\n",

The term <em>Jacob</em> means the people on a physical level. The term <em>Israel</em> means on the level that allowed Jacob to have his name changed to <em>Israel</em> by reaching the higher spiritual level. In either case, Bil'am is stating that any one who regards the <em>strength</em> of Bnai Yisrael on a physical level, so that he thinks that all that needs to be done is reduce that physical level, does not understand what is going on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי מנה עפר יעקוב וגו, You, Balak count the numerical size of this\npeople (CH. XXII,5 I.L.), the number of its fighters, by that\nreckoning it seems too big for you, and you believe that if one could\nreduce it in that direction you would be able to conquer it, you\nbelieve that if one altogether one could get at it vially if one could\nsucceed in bringing a curse on its material bodily thriving: מי מנה\nעפר יעקוב, who then counts what is earthly in Jacob, ומספר את רבע\nישראל, and counts the physically born numbers of Israel (- רבע in the\nsam sense as in Lev. XIX,19 & XX,16 -). The prestige of other nwations\nmay rest on the number of the \"bodies\" of its population, their\nincreasse may form a threat to be feared by other nations, their\ndecrease give rise to hopes. Not so is itwith Jacob-Israel. Whether\nthey are small in numbers as \"Jacob\" or growing numerous as \"Israel\",\nit is not that which is עפר and which increases or diminishes itself\njust by animal-like breeding in which its importance, its happiness or\nunhapiness consists. Not even death have they to fear, bodily deathe\ncannot reach their true selves תמות נפשי וגו. I would like to die as\nthey do, to know that my end would be like theirs, their dying is more\nblissful than our living, because they are ישרים, because they\ncorrespond to the calling for which on the whole men are \"men\" and\nstrive for this purpose in a \"straight line\" without turning aside.\nSummarising this first \"parable\" of Balaam, he had thereby to point\nout to Balak the complete specific difference of Israel to all the\nother nations, and to tell him that the future of this nation was\ncompletely independent of the physical-material causes which could be\nassumed to be the conditions for the growth and development of other\nnations. Hence they would also be unreachable by all damaging\ninfluences to which the welfare of other nations could be made to\nsuccumb. But as his words made the judging of the well-being of this\nnation altogether depended on the principles out of which it made its\nprosperity, this speech is a true משל, one that goes beyond the\nconcrete single case, a sying which brings a fact, a moral, applicable\ngenerally out of the actual example quoted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In short, although \"Ish\" and \"Adam\" both have connotations of being both wicked (במות אדם רשע,  איש אשר אין מעצר לרוחו) and righteous (ויקרא את שמם אדם ביום הבראם, משה איש אלהים), there is nonetheless a fundamental difference between them.</p>\n<p>The term \"Adam\" refers to one who has a very base, coarse, and crass nature. As his name testifies, he is one who is very earthly and connected to physicality. The term \"Ish\" refers to one who has a very refined, sensitive, and nuanced nature. The root of this name is \"Yeish-יש\" or \"there is\", representing the truly good and spiritual nature of the world as it is inherent and eternal(ישיות וקיום נצחי).</p>\n<p>In our verse, the \"Ish\" refers to a person who is naturally a trustworthy person and one who calls upon him for a task assumes with certainty that he will execute it.

The term \"ויכזב\" in our verse refers to the failure of a given thing, like<br />\nלא יכזבו מימיו\" - ישעיהו,נח,יא\".</p>\n<p>\"Adam\" in our verse refers to a person who is naturally an untrustworthy person who would regret even accepting the task.

Anyone know the source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Talmud states (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=17&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 17a</a>) that one can only be appointed to the Sanhedrin if he can prove that a <em>sheretz</em> is pure (despite the fact that a <em>sheretz</em> is impure):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב אין מושיבין בסנהדרין אלא מי שיודע לטהר את השרץ מה\"ת</p>\n<p>Rab Judah said in Rab's name: None is to be given a seat on the Sanhedrin unless he is able to prove the cleanness of a reptile from Biblical texts.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_17.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is apparently a way to test someone's intellectual abilities; if one cannot come up with such a proof he is unworthy of sitting on the Sanhedrin. It is certainly possible that someone giving <em>semicha</em> would set a similar requirement.</p>\n<p>The Talmud elsewhere (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=13b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eruvin 13b</a>) mentions individuals who provided numerous reasons for something to be pure or impure:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר אבהו א\"ר יוחנן תלמיד היה לו לר\"מ וסומכוס שמו שהיה אומר על כל דבר ודבר של טומאה ארבעים ושמונה טעמי טומאה ועל כל דבר ודבר של טהרה ארבעים ושמונה טעמי טהרה תנא תלמיד ותיק היה ביבנה שהיה מטהר את השרץ במאה וחמשים טעמים</p>\n<p>R. Abbahu stated in the name of R. Johanan: R. Meir had a disciple of the name of Symmachus\nwho, for every rule concerning ritual uncleanness, supplied forty-eight reasons in support of its\nuncleanness, and for every rule concerning ritual cleanness, forty-eight reasons in support of its\ncleanness.\nOne taught: There was an assiduous student at Jamnia who by a hundred and fifty reasons\nproved that a [dead] creeping thing was clean.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Eiruvin.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Earlier in the same discussion the Talmud states that R. Meir himself would convincingly argue both sides of the argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר אחא בר חנינא גלוי וידוע לפני מי שאמר והיה העולם שאין בדורו של רבי מאיר כמותו ומפני מה לא קבעו הלכה כמותו שלא יכלו חביריו לעמוד על סוף דעתו שהוא אומר על טמא טהור ומראה לו פנים על טהור טמא ומראה לו פנים תנא</p>\n<p>R. Aha b. Hanina said: It is revealed and known before Him Who spoke and the world came into\nexistence, that in the generation of R. Meir there was none equal to him; then why was not the\nhalachah fixed in agreement with his views? Because his colleagues could not fathom the depths of\nhis mind, for he would declare the ritually unclean to be clean and supply plausible proof, and the\nritually clean to be unclean and also supply plausible proof.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Eiruvin.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yom Tov Asevili</a> in his commentary to another statement on the same page cites the French rabbis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותירצו כי כשעלה משה למרום לקבל תורה הראו לו על כל דבר ודבר מ\"ט פנים לאיסור ומ\"ט פנים להיתר ושאל להקב\"ה על זה ואמר שיהא זה מסור לחכמי ישראל שבכל דור ודור ויהיה הכרעה כמותם</p>\n<p>And they answer that when Moses went on high to receive the Torah they showed him on every issue 49 ways to forbid and 49 ways to permit, and he asked God about this and He said that this is given over to the Sages of Israel in each generation and the decision follows them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This follows one of the long-standing teachings the Lubavitcher Rebbe like is found for example in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25035&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Menachem Hitvadiyut, vol. 3 from the year 5711, pg. 12 notes 26-27</a></p>\n<p>And like the Rebbe cites from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Rosh_Hashanah.7b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Rosh HaShanah, chapter 1, Halacha 3</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בנוהג שבעולם מלך בשר ודם גוזר גזירה. רצה מקיימה רצו אחרים מקיימים אותה <strong>אבל הקב\"ה אינו כן אלא גוזר גזירה ומקיימה תחילה מאי טעמא ושמרו את משמרתי אני ה' אני הוא ששימרתי מצותיה של תורה תחילה.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the same sentiment that is also expressed by Rabbi Avin Bar Rav Adda in relation to tefillin as found in Berachot 6a, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda said that Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where is it derived that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wears phylacteries? As it is stated: “The Lord has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so the answer to your question should be found in the laws of Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Rambam in Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Shabbat 24:7 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[A court] may not punish on Shabbat.</strong> Even though the punishment is a positive commandment, it does not override [forbidden types of work on] Shabbat. How is this? If one surely become liable for lashes or the death penalty, we neither give him lashes nor kill him on Shabbat; as it is stated (Exodus 35:3), \"You may not kindle fire in all of your inhabitations on the Shabbat day\"—this is a prohibition to the court that, on Shabbat, they not burn someone who became liable for burning. And the same is true with the other punishments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However this raises the same question you raise. Does this prohibition only apply to <em>the execution</em> of the judgement or <em>the process of judgement</em> itself?</p>\n<p>But if one considers the first halacha in that same chapter, the prohibition would seem to extend even to the judgement itself which would be like discussing with your business associates, meaning those Judges sitting with you on the Jewish court, what business to take up the next day.</p>\n<p>In other words, actual <strong>deliberation of the case and judgement</strong>, while leaving the execution of the judgement until after Shabbat, <strong>is also prohibited on Shabbat</strong>.</p>\n<p>Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Shabbat 24:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Some acts are forbidden on the Sabbath even though they neither resemble nor lead to prohibited work.</strong> Why then were they forbidden? Because it is written: \"If you refrain from following your business on the Sabbath, on my holy day… If you honor it, not following your wonted ways, <strong>not pursuing your business, nor speaking of it</strong>\" (Isaiah 58:13). Hence, <strong>one is forbidden to go anywhere on the Sabbath in connection with his business, or even to talk about it.</strong> Thus one must not discuss with his partner what to sell on the next day, or what to buy, or how to build a certain house, or what merchandise to take to such-and-such a place. All this, and the like, is forbidden, for it is written \"nor speaking of it.\" That is to say, speaking of business on the Sabbath is forbidden; thinking of it, however, is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it is worth noting that the last comment from Rambam in this halacha appears to be an insight into the judgement of Rosh Hashanah, for example, when it falls out on Shabbat. Rambam emphasizes that thinking about business matters is not prohibited on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>And so, in context G-d could think about how a judgement would be deliberated in the Heavenly court and how it might resolve.</p>\n<p>But this last concept needs to be understood in the context of the teaching of Eliyahu HaNavi that is found in the <em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Sefard%2C_Shabbat_Eve_Mincha%2C_Mincha.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">P'tach Eliyahu</a></em> recited at Mincha of erev Shabbat. G-d's thoughts are not like our thoughts. From our perspective, G-d's thoughts are <em><strong>like</strong></em> a completed action, even though by G-d it is thought.</p>\n<p>And this idea relates also to the concept of G-d judging someone unfavorably on Rosh HaShanah. And yet through our actions through the remaining cycle of Tishrei, that <em>judgement</em> can be overturned.</p>\n\n\n",

However, they don't provide an easy stream in the Judaica and Seforim stores around the world (and the USA in particular).</p>\n<p>Are there any effective ways to get a self-published sefer into all of the Seforim stores, or at least carried by a few distributors?

If they aren't haskaficly questionable most would agree.</p>\n<p>What is difficult is to track whether  those seforim were sold or not. The owner of the seforim store isn't going to take the time to keep track and notify you every time one sells. If your seforim are not selling rapidly enough for him to reorder he is going to expect you to show up and see how many of the seforim you gave him are left to know what was sold. He therefore  ended up using a publisher who  has a continuous  relationship with the seforim stores and distributors.</p>\n<p>Note:This was over thirty years ago when seforim stores didn't track inventory by computer and there were more  small seforim stores than now. Presumably some things have changed since then.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Before publishing if you can get haskamas (approbations) from recognized rabbis then you may not have to self publish. With that you could go to one of the mainstream publishers first to see if they will publish your sefer for you. If they decide against publishing it then self publishing still remains an option with contacting sefarim stores directly. Starting out you could even offer to give the copies on consignment for a period of time. This way if you are a new author they aren't nervous about the up front cash cost to display your work. Best of success.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why \"I have been young\" in Psalm 37?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The psalmist said, in a line we also recite in <em>birkat hamazon</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נַ֤עַר ׀ הָיִ֗יתִי גַּם־זָ֫קַ֥נְתִּי וְֽלֹא־רָ֭אִיתִי צַדִּ֣יק נֶעֱזָ֑ב וְ֝זַרְע֗וֹ מְבַקֶּשׁ־לָֽחֶם  -- I have been young, and I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned, nor his seed begging for bread. [Ps. 37:25]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The plain meaning can't be right because we have all seen righteous people go through bad times.  Many commentators have provided alternate meanings.  My favorite is from Rav Soloveitchik, who, proceeding by analogy in wording, notes that Queen Esther asks King Achashverosh to spare the Jews using these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֠י אֵיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽרָאִ֔יתִי בָּרָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑י וְאֵֽיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽרָאִ֔יתִי בְּאָבְדַ֖ן מוֹלַדְתִּֽי\n-- How can I bear to watch the disaster which will befall my people, and how can I bear to watch the destruction of my family? [Esther 8:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same word (רָ֭אִיתִי - seen) is used in both places, but in the case of Esther, she clearly means: \"Can I bear to see all this <em>and do nothing about it</em>?\"  Likewise, the line in Psalms means: \"I have not seen the righteous abandoned, nor his seed begging for bread <em>and done nothing about it</em>.\"</p>\n<p>OK, now my question.  What does the line \"I have been young\" add to the thought?  \"I am old\" should be sufficient.  I have not seen a commentary on this.  I believe the answer may hold yet another meaning.

As is the simple meaning of the posuk.</p>\n<p>Even so it was not a valid conversion, or, presumably marriage.</p>\n<p>The Rambam in Issurei Biah 13:14  says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַל יַעֲלֶה עַל דַּעְתְּךָ שֶׁשִּׁמְשׁוֹן הַמּוֹשִׁיעַ אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל אוֹ שְׁלֹמֹה מֶלֶךְ יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁנִּקְרָא יְדִיד ה' נָשְׂאוּ נָשִׁים נָכְרִיּוֹת בְּגֵיוּתָן. אֶלָּא סוֹד הַדָּבָר כָּךְ הוּא. שֶׁהַמִּצְוָה הַנְּכוֹנָה כְּשֶׁיָּבֹא הַגֵּר אוֹ הַגִּיֹּרֶת לְהִתְגַּיֵּר בּוֹדְקִין אַחֲרָיו שֶׁמָּא בִּגְלַל מָמוֹן שֶׁיִּטּל אוֹ בִּשְׁבִיל שְׂרָרָה שֶׁיִּזְכֶּה לָהּ אוֹ מִפְּנֵי הַפַּחַד בָּא לְהִכָּנֵס לַדָּת. וְאִם אִישׁ הוּא בּוֹדְקִין אַחֲרָיו שֶׁמָּא עֵינָיו נָתַן בְּאִשָּׁה יְהוּדִית. וְאִם אִשָּׁה הִיא בּוֹדְקִין שֶׁמָּא עֵינֶיהָ נָתְנָה בְּבָחוּר מִבַּחוּרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One should not think that Samson who saved the Jewish people, and Solomon King of Israel, who is called \"the friend of God,\"married gentile woman who did not convert. Instead, the matter can be explained as follows: The proper way of performing the mitzvah is when a male or a female prospective convert comes, we inspect his motives for conversion. Perhaps he is coming for the sake of financial gain, in order to receive a position of authority, or he desires to enter our faith because of fear. For a man, we check whether he focused his attention on a Jewish woman. For a woman, we check whether she focused her attention on a Jewish youth etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even so the Rambam continues (Ibid 15)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן שִׁמְשׁוֹן גִּיֵּר וְנָשָׂא. וְהַדָּבָר יָדוּעַ שֶׁלֹּא חָזְרוּ אֵלּוּ אֶלָּא בִּשְׁבִיל דָּבָר וְלֹא עַל פִּי בֵּית דִּין גִּיְּרוּם חֲשָׁבָן הַכָּתוּב כְּאִלּוּ הֵן עַכּוּ''ם וּבְאִסּוּרָן עוֹמְדִין. וְעוֹד שֶׁהוֹכִיחַ סוֹפָן עַל תְּחִלָּתָן שֶׁהֵן עוֹבְדוֹת כּוֹכָבִים וּמַזָּלוֹת שֶׁלָּהֶן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Samson converted [women] and married them. It is well known that they converted only because of an ulterior motive and that their conversion was not under the guidance of the court. <strong>Hence the Torah considered it as if they were gentiles and remained forbidden.</strong> Moreover, their conduct ultimately revealed their initial intent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Chazal  explain elsewhere  that Shimson was unaware of his future wives insincerity with their conversions. He was punished for his lack of effort to ascertain the sincerity of their conversation without  ulterior motives.</p>\n\n\n",

So from this list, we have a full list of the mitzvot the Rambam is including in all of Mishneh Torah.</p>\n<p>If he is going to list all the mitzvot in the order he will address them in the balance of his work, what does listing them before that add?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the first listing he gives the Scriptural source for each one (which fits with his view, in the Shorashim prefaced to his Sefer Hamitzvos, that the 613 don't include Rabbinical enactments or (generally) those derived from the 13 principles of Torah exegesis); in the second one he doesn't.</p>\n<p>(In the Rambam La'Am edition, they did combine these two listings: the index to the work (second listing) includes the Scriptural sources for each mitzvah (from the first listing). It's possible that the Rambam didn't want to do it that way because it would make the index too hard to follow, or maybe because then it would be more difficult to see the counts of 248 and 365 mitzvos.

If a person did, he has a <em>mitzvah</em> to send away the mother bird, in order to fix the prohibition he broke.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there was a list anywhere (or even if someone would make a comprehensive list here) of all the different cases of such a <em>mitzvah</em>?

One is that <em>Chazal</em> accepted that two <em>parshiyos</em> are to be learned one from the other, but they weren't sure which words connected the two. One example is the <em>parsha</em> of <em>ones</em> (a rapist) and <em>mefateh</em> (a seducer). The two share similar laws and are learned one from the other. Nevertheless, the <em>gemarra</em> has a dispute about which words connect the two.</p>\n<p>Another type of <em>gezeira shava</em> is when <em>Chazal</em> had accepted that a certain word is to be used for a <em>gezeira shava</em>, but they don't know where to apply it. I believe your <em>gemarra</em> is an example. The <em>gemarra</em> is suggesting that the <em>gezeira shava</em> is this particular word (אות, דורות, etc.). However, <em>Chazal</em> didn't know where to apply it. The <em>gemarra</em> is suggesting to apply it in contexts 1 & 2  (like you say), but that's not definitive. If we are to employ such a <em>gezeira shava</em>, perhaps it should be 1 & 3.</p>\n<p>In the case of that <em>gemarra</em> for example, it's suggesting to learn <em>Bris Milah</em> overrides Shabbos because of a <em>gezeira shava</em> of אות אות. However, if you were to learn that <em>gezeira shava</em> teaches you that something overrides Shabbos, the <em>gemarra</em> is saying that  perhaps the <em>gezeira shava</em> is to apply between Shabbos and Tefillin, which also has such a word. Since we know (from elsewhere) that Tefillin doesn't override Shabbos, the <em>gemarra</em> rejects using that <em>gezeira shava</em>.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if the <em>gemarra</em> is saying to apply it in this context <strong>instead</strong>, or <strong>additionally</strong>. Either way, the <strong>Halichos Olam</strong> and <strong>Ramban</strong> are limiting how much <em>Chazal</em> really accepted from tradition. The rest was up to them to figure out, where the <em>gemarra</em> you're quoting shows the back and forth.</p>\n<p>Why the <em>gemarra</em> doesn't always ask this, I'm not sure. Perhaps finding a case where this happens would make it clear why it didn't.</p>\n\n\n",

I found an interesting article in The Curse of Ham - Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by David M.

See <em>Sefer ha-Temunah</em>, 62a; David ibn Zimra’s <em>Magen David</em> (Amsterdam, 1713), 47b. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_HaTemunah#Missing_letter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lawrence Kushner</a>, author of The Book of Letters: A Mystical Alef-Bait, Sefer HaTemunah teaches that \"every defect in our present universe is mysteriously connected with this unimaginable consonant\", and that as soon as the missing letter is given to us, our Universe will be filled with undreamed of new words, the words that will turn repression into loving. He says it is the shin, but I believe that <em>ghayin</em> is more logical.</p>\n<p>So it is quite possible that this root was originally bifurcated as well: one meaning to enter and another meaning to mix. <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2006/05/erev.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Balashon</a> appears to allude to such, but never makes the connection, as does <a href=\"https://www.jewishlinkbwc.com/index.php/features/10422-what-is-the-origin-of-the-words-erev-and-boker\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitchell First</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/erev-rav-a-mixed-multitude-of-meanings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Rabbi David J.

Even the Zohar takes advantage of this multivariate linguistics. See From Metaphysics to Midrash - Myth, History, and the Interpretation of Scripture in Lurianic Kabbala by Shaul Magid, pp. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Metaphysics_to_Midrash/YUbGlHdhBaUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=erev%20%20rav%20zohar&pg=PA84&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">84</a> <em>ff</em>. In light of the following, then, there is no connection between the <em>erev rav</em> and Arabs.</p>\n<p>This would explain why I cannot find any connection made by the Rabbi's (at least in my library). The Gra writes in Kol HaTor, Chapter <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kol_HaTor.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:2</a>, that the <em>Erev Rav</em> are heads of the Jews in exile.

As Joshua Blau puts it (<em>Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew</em>, p181): \"Because of the weak pronunciation of laryngeals/pharyngeals, vowels preceding and following them were in closer contact than vowels divided by other consonants, and thus the laryngeals/pharyngeals promoted vowel assimilation.\"</p>\n<p>In this case, the pataḥ of חַי requires no change of the vowel of הַ. However, the first case is חָי (as it's in pause), and kamats is a higher vowel (in the mouth, it's a open-mid back rounded vowel) than pataḥ (open front unrounded vowel), and segol (a open-mid front rounded vowel) matches the kamats better than pataḥ does. (See the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vowel chart</a> on Wikipedia.)</p>\n<p>To go a bit beyond your question: different laryngeals/pharyngeals (אהחע and additionally ר) have different amounts and locations (in the mouth) of articulation, and so we see different effects on the vowel of the definite article. Cases where הַ becomes הָ can be understood additionally as \"compensatory lengthening\", wherein the vowel of הַ gets lengthened to replace the expected dagesh in the following letter (which is omitted in these letters; rhythmically, a closed syllable with a short vowel is similar to an open syllable with a long vowel).</p>\n\n\n",

That a person should work at\nTorah and mitzvos with the <strong>motivation</strong> to fulfill the words of G-d and\nneither to take a crown or inflate oneself over other people, but\nrather abase onself in order to carry out the word of HaShem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the meaning is not connected with influencing Heaven and your question falls away.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One way to look at it, is the notion of going above and beyond, transcending the normal human existence to put Hashem and his Torah/mitzvos first.</p>\n<p>As you mention, there are numerous examples, but perhaps we can start with one in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 2:12</a> -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי יוֹסֵי אוֹמֵר, יְהִי מָמוֹן חֲבֵרְךָ חָבִיב עָלֶיךָ כְּשֶׁלָּךְ, וְהַתְקֵן עַצְמְךָ לִלְמֹד תּוֹרָה, שֶׁאֵינָהּ יְרֻשָּׁה לָךְ. וְכָל מַעֲשֶׂיךָ יִהְיוּ לְשֵׁם שָׁמָיִם:</p>\n<p><em>Rabbi Yose said: Let the property of your fellow be as precious unto you as your own; Make yourself fit to study Torah for it will not be yours by inheritance; And let all your actions be for [the sake of] the name of heaven.</em> (sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.12?lang=bi&p2=Bartenura_on_Pirkei_Avot.2.12.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> explains this mishna to mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל מַעֲשֶׂיךָ יִהְיוּ לְשֵׁם שָׁמָיִם. אַף בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁאַתָּה עוֹסֵק בַּאֲכִילָה וּשְׁתִיָּה וּבְדֶרֶךְ אֶרֶץ לֹא תִּתְכַּוֵּן לְהַהֲנוֹת גּוּפְךָ, אֶלָּא שֶׁתִּהְיֶה בָּרִיא לַעֲשׂוֹת רְצוֹן קוֹנְךָ:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\"All of your actions should be for the sake of Heaven\"</strong>: even at the time that you are involved in eating and drinking and in the way of the world (derech eretz), do not have the intention to give pleasure to your body, but rather that you should be healthy [in order] to do the will of your Creator.</em> (sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that our lowly physical existence can be elevated if we choose to maximise our time on this earth by choosing to adopt a healthy lifestyle to best serve Hashem. In other words, the aim of this world is to act with pure motives, thereby synthesising our actions above and beyond.</p>\n<p>Take Korach for example. He is seen as the archetype whose actions were not for the sake of Heaven (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 5:17</a>). His whole approach is regarded as being self-serving. Unlike the type of arguments that raged between Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel, Korach's dispute was rooted by his own need to further his ambition. It wasn't predicated on personal growth and gaining a closer relationship with G-d.

Ask anyone why they are doing a Mitzva. The general response is <em>Lishma</em>. Ask them again: OK - you are doing that Mitzva, <em>Lishma</em> - why are you doing that mitzva, <em>Lishma</em>? A few individuals might say: I am doing it <em>Lishma, Lishma</em>. Ask them again: why are you doing that Mitzva <em>Lishma, Lishma</em>?</p>\n<p>In truth, it's an infinite regress. The 'answer' proposes an explanation, but the mechanism proposed needs as much of an explanation as the original fact to be explained. Eventually he or she will admit perforce that the reason I am doing this Mitzva <em>Lishma, Lishma, Lishma</em> to the hundredth degree is because <strong>I</strong> choose/desire to do so.</p>\n<p>Paradox? There is no contradiction between self and <em>Lishma</em>. לֶךְ־לְךָ֛/go for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rashi Genesis 12:1:\nלך לך. לַהֲנָאָתְךָ וּלְטוֹבָתְךָ,\nliterally, go for thyself — for your own benefit, for your own good ..</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Was Abraham not a Lishma-nick? Would Avraham have passed the first of his great tests if he told God that he did not want to go out for himself, but solely \"<em>Lishma</em>\" (in the erroneous sense of how the term is used)? Should he have said : forget the benefit to me, God! I have nothing to do with this!? I doubt it. The command was Go for Thyself - a paradigm for future mitzvot too.  <em>Lishma</em> connotes a partnership - to self-actualize through God's commandments. Not to deny/obliterate self. Something along the lines of: I do this Mitzva because God commands so (for the ultimate purpose of my self realization).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ramchal, Daat Tevunot: Chapter 14\n– היסוד הראשון שעליו עומד כל הבנין הוא, שרצה הרצון העליון שיהיה האדם משלים את עצמו\nThe first foundation upon which the entire construct stands is, that the Heavenly Will wanted that man should complete himself ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I suppose it is possible to argue that lech lecha doesn't really mean lecha lecha or that it does not apply to other mitzvot and that the Ramchal is talking about mankind's self actualizing via the negation and destruction of any sense of self, but none of these possibilities are satisfying to say the least.</p>\n<p>There is nothing selfish about self realization. The opposite is true. The true perfection of self is the ultimate purpose of the cosmos. Selfish is when one does something bad, or something good for all the wrong reasons. And sometimes this act counts as a lower level Mitzva. One can learn Torah to be the smartest person on the block. He or she may be fulfilling a Mitzva but selfishness is in play. When one however learns Torah because God commands us to be a perfected human being - that is sublime.</p>\n\n\n",

Shouldn’t it be the opposite?

Therefore if he is wrong he is liable.</p>\n<p>The Gemara is not referring to a  situation  where the money changer was getting <em>paid</em> for his opinion.</p>\n<p>The Rambam  Hilchos Sechirus 10:5 says as follows</p>\n<p>הַמַּרְאֶה דִּינָר לְשֻׁלְחָנִי וְאָמַר לוֹ יָפֶה הוּא וְנִמְצָא רַע אִם בְּשָׂכָר רָאָהוּ חַיָּב לְשַׁלֵּם אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהוּא בָּקִי וְאֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לְהִתְלַמֵּד. וְאִם בְּחִנָּם רָאָהוּ פָּטוּר וְהוּא שֶׁיִּהְיֶה בָּקִי שֶׁאֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לְהִתְלַמֵּד. וְאִם אֵינוֹ בָּקִי חַיָּב לְשַׁלֵּם אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהוּא בְּחִנָּם וְהוּא שֶׁיֹּאמַר לַשֻּׁלְחָנִי עָלֶיךָ אֲנִי סוֹמֵךְ אוֹ שֶׁהָיוּ הַדְּבָרִים מַרְאִין שֶׁהוּא סוֹמֵךְ עַל רְאִיָּתוֹ וְלֹא יַרְאֶה לַאֲחֵרִים.</p>\n<p><em>When a person shows a coin to a money changer and he says that it is acceptable for use, and it is discovered to be unacceptable, if he charged for his services, he is obligated to pay even though he is an expert and does not require further training. If he did not charge, he is not liable, provided he is an expert and does not require further training.\nIf he is not an expert, he must reimburse the questioner even when he does not charge for his services.\nThe above applies when the questioner tells the money changer: \"I am relying upon you,\" or it is obvious from the situation that he is relying on his opinion and is not seeking another opinion</em></p>\n\n\n",

Avos D'Rabbi Nathan is a commentary to meseches Avos by R. Nathan, who explained his understanding of the story based on tradition. Binyan Yehoshua comments here, that Rabbi Nathan held that Miriam was on the side of Tziporah in the story <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 12</a>. Miriam and Aharon were Moshe's older siblings who certainly knew Moshe's character very well. The problem with such approach is that nobody has been ever judged for character traits, but people are judged for their actions.</p>\n<p>Thus, the words דעתו גסה עליו means that his (Moshe's) mind became heavy, not arrogant. I.e. in the view of R. Nathan, Aharon replied that Moshe is preocupied with the Torah too much, meaning <em>on his own</em>, which is not required by Hashem. Arrogant is גס רוח, as we know from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Avos 5.19</a> about Bil'am.</p>\n<p>When the Torah says that Moshe was עניו, it does not mean the present definition of modesty. It means, that Moshe did everything in accordance with Hashem's words better than anybody could ever do, did not add, and did not subtract. R. Nathan then draws conclusions based on his assumptions, why Miriam was punished: She and Aharon were judging without Moshe's presence and that they did not know for sure whether Moshe was doing something wrong.</p>\n<p>At the same time, one can learn the story from Sifrei that Miriam was defending Moshe as I explained <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/131451/what-was-miriams-lashon-hara\">here</a>, because <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Bamidbar.99.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Bamidbar 99</a> argues on R. Nathan, it says: ומה מרים, שלא נתכוונה לדבר באחיה לגנאי אלא לשבח</p>\n\n\n",

For most the United States and Europe, one should face southeast.</p>\n<p>South of Jerusalem's latitude (approximately 32N), one would face either northeast or northwest, depending on his location relative to Jerusalem's meridian.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that the direction a synagogue faces may not precisely correspond to the direction of Jerusalem, since architectural considerations often come into play.</p>\n<p>There is also a dispute among the poskim whether the direction one should face is the shortest distance to Jerusalem, or its compass direction. As the earth is a sphere, these can be very different directions.

Hence, if there is some extenuating circumstance, prayers may be in any direction needed to improve kavana. For instance, I was once on a flight from NY to Israel where there was a minyan in the back of the plane. Now, regardless of which view you have of the direction toward Jerusalem, it would be hard to argue against the direction of the front of the plane! Yet in this case, the minyan faced backwards, towards New York. Reason? Facing all of those people (including many women) was not conducive to concentration on the prayers.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which is better, wearing Tefilin on Rosh Chodesh at musaf or leaving shul early?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Background:\nSince the corona virus dwindled and then returned, our regular minyan davens in a yard nearby. I put on my tallis and tefilin at home and walk to the yard, daven then return home and take off my tallis and tefilin. I do not take my tallis bag with me as the yard is very dusty and with few surfaces to put it down.</p>\n<p>Question:\nOn Rosh Chodesh, I did the same thing as above but when it came time to remove my tefilin before musaf, I had a dilemma. I didn't want to put the tefilin down on a dusty/dirty stone wall (risk scratching the tefillin as well) so either</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I could leave the tefilin on and say musaf</li>\n</ol>\n<p>or</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>I could leave early and take off my tefilin at home and then daven mussaf but I'd be missing a few kaddishes, kedushah and mussaf bitzibur. Finding another minayan afterwards wasn't a feasible option due to needing to get the kids to school etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which is preferable to do? Or is there another option that is better?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I left my tefillin bag at home and brought the plastic boxes in my pockets.  Before musaf, I took off the shel rosh, took the box out of my pocket with my other hand, put it in the box, and put the box back in my pocket.  Then the same with the shel yad.</p>\n<p>When I got home, I wrapped them up properly and put them in the bag.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Since I didn't like either of the two options mentioned in the question, I unwound the tefilin from my hand and moved the shel rosh very much to the side of my head so that I wasn't wearing it properly (and perhaps it was considered as if I am not wearing them) and I covered my head with the tallis so it wouldn't look weird to others and I stayed until the end of davening.</p>\n<p>This was my \"hafsharah\" but I do not have a source for what I did. I just seemed better then leaving early and missing until the end of davening. Feel free to critique.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is marble not considered a stone?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Defilement_by_Leprosy.14.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Tumat Tzara'at 14:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַלְּבֵנִים וְהַשַּׁיִשׁ אֵינָן חֲשׁוּבִין כַּאֲבָנִים</p>\n<p>Bricks and Marble aren't considered stones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the reason for this decision?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rambam is based on Nega’im 12:2, which states (based on Vayikra 14:45) that a house needs to be composed of stone, wood and earth in order to contract <em>tzara’at</em> impurity, and that marble does not count.</p>\n<p>Tiferet Yisrael in Bo’az 3 explains that marble is never referred to as simply “stone” but instead “stones of marble”.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a purely speculative idea.  But it's worth considering since you are looking for a \"reason\" behind the mitzvah and not a discussion of the halacha itself. <em>Why is marble not considered like other stones.</em></p>\n<p>Rambam distinguishes in this halacha between 2 categories, 1) \"stones\" (אבן) together with soil and wood and 2) \"bricks\" (לבנים) and \"marble\" (שיש).</p>\n<p>You could postulate that bricks are man-made, which would also agree with the idea that tiles are in the same category as bricks in regard to this halacha. Tiles and bricks are formed by subjecting mud or clay to extreme heat. The heat causes them to take on different qualities in terms of hardness and durability than the original clay.</p>\n<p>But marble is generally, naturally occurring.</p>\n<p>That takes you to the subject of geology. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rocks & stones fall into 3 general classifications, Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic</a>. The 1st two are essentially derived from the earth's crust and are in their original state.</p>\n<p>Igneous rocks originate from lava which cools and crystalizes. They are in their original state of being. Sedimentary rocks are like concrete. Igneous rocks that have worn away through erosion, and other matter that are carried in water mix together, and then precipitate out in sediment. Then over time with moderate temperature and pressure from what lays on higher levels of sediment, the sedimentary rock forms through compaction.</p>\n<p>Metamorphic rock, of which marble is included, is also originally a composite but is different in that high pressure and extreme temperature change the physical properties and chemical composition of the resulting stone. It takes on completely new qualities and properties. Although naturally occurring, it is a very similar formation process as that of brick and tile.</p>\n<p>And so this transformation process or metamorphosis is what seems to be common in relation to marble, brick and tile. And would suggest that this is why marble is distinguished from other stone.</p>\n<p>For those who might be interested in some additional insights into the relationship between these 3 elements of marble, brick and stone, it is brought in the writings of Rabbi Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin that <em>marble</em> (שיש) is associated with the Supernal concept of <em>Gevurah of Ain Sof</em> which he says is responsible for the <em>Tzimtzum HaRishon</em> (צמצום הראשון) which made possible the entire creation.</p>\n<p>In kabbalistic literature, this is the initial transformation from Infinite (אין, אין סוף, בלי גבול) to Finite (יש, גבול) which resulted in what is called the Makom Panuy (מקום פנוי, החלל), meaning a <em>place or possibility</em> that <em>appeared</em> devoid of G-d. This is often referred to as <em>Creation Yesh mi'Ayin</em> (יש מאין) or <em>Creation Ex-Nihilo</em>. It is like a quantum leap (דילוג) from one state to a completely different state.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Zacuto in his introduction to Sefer Mevo Sha'arim, pg. 5, and Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in Sefer Adir B'Marom, pg. 92 of the Friedlander edition explain that this is associated with the <em>transformation</em> of G-d's name (יה-יה) via A't-Ba'sh. That the name becomes (צם-צם) <em>Tzam-tzem</em>.</p>\n<p>If the same A't-Ba'sh transformation is applied to <em>bricks</em> (לבנים), the item associated with marble, the result is (כשטמ׳י) which has a gematria value of 379. This is also the value for <em>the G-d of material existence</em> (אל הגשם) which alludes to the teaching from Rabbi Tzadok, the Ramaz and the Ramchal mentioned above.</p>\n<p>If <em>stone</em> (אבן), that category which is distinct from marble and bricks,  is considered in similar fashion it is noted that the gematria is 53, which is also דילוג (the quantum leap mentioned above) and הגדולה, which is the kabbalistic term associated with <em>Chesed of Ain Sof</em>, the polar opposite of that which  manifested the Tzimtzum HaRishon, <em>Gevurah of Ain Sof</em> like is mentioned above.</p>\n<p>And if the A't-Ba'sh transformation is applied to אבן, the resulting gematria is 709 which happens to be אין מזל לישראל, the expression of the Sages that indicates Israel is not under the direction or supervision of G-d's Heavenly-Angelic system from creation, but rather from G-d directly (Hashgacha Pratit) <em>Divine Providence</em>.</p>\n<p>And to associate all this with the time we currently face, Erev Tisha b'Av 5780, (709 תש׳ט), the A't-Ba'sh of אבן, is also the gematria of יעקב יצחק הורוביץ, the Seer of Lublin (החוזה מלובלין) whose 205th Yartzeit falls on the 9th of Av.</p>\n<p>In his memory and merit and in keeping with the concepts mentioned above contrasting and comparing stone, marble and bricks and how G-d can <em>immediately</em> transform <em>any situation</em> <strong>even in the blink of an eye</strong>, may we all see the transformation of all sadness to joy, all bitterness to sweetness and all darkness to light, immediately and without delay.</p>\n\n\n",

This license was not granted to overstep the words of the Torah, but rather to create a fence around the words of the Torah. When the court sees that the people have broken the accepted norms with regard to a matter, they may establish safeguards to strengthen the matter according to what appears necessary to them. <strong>All the above applies with regard to establishing directives for the immediate time, and not with regard to the establishment of halachah for all time. An incident occurred where they had a man lashed for engaging in relations with his wife under a tree</strong>.</p>\n<p>(<em>Touger translation</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply that what the man did in this case <strong>is not ordinarily deserving of any punishment. He was punished exceptionally</strong>, as the court of that time and place saw fit.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960669/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twenty-One.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Hilchot Issurei Biah</strong> 21:14</a> he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָסוּר לְאָדָם לָבֹא עַל אִשְׁתּוֹ בַּשְּׁוָקִים וּבָרְחוֹבוֹת אוֹ בַּגַּנּוֹת וּבַפַּרְדֵּסִין אֶלָּא בְּבֵית דִּירָה. שֶׁלֹּא יֵרָאֶה כִּזְנוּת וְיַרְגִּילוּ עַצְמָם לִידֵי זְנוּת. וְהַבּוֹעֵל אֶת אִשְׁתּוֹ בִּמְקוֹמוֹת אֵלּוּ מַכִּין אוֹתוֹ מַכַּת מַרְדּוּת.‏</p>\n<p><strong>It is forbidden for a man to engage in relations with his wife in the marketplaces, streets, gardens, or orchards</strong>. Instead, [a couple should be physically intimate] only in a home, so that they will not appear as licentious relations and will not habituate themselves to licentious relations. <strong>When a man engages in relations with his wife in such places, he should be given stripes for rebellious conduct</strong>.</p>\n<p>(<em>Touger translation</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply that <strong>any act of public intercourse is punished (rabinically) by lashes</strong>. It is not left to the discretion of the local court.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogatchover_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>R.

However, in the case under discussion in this question, the incident took place beneath a fig tree, <strong>which provided at least minimal seclusion</strong>.</p>\n<p>That being the case, <strong>this act was not, strictly speaking, deserving of lashes at all</strong>, even rabbinically.

If we ignore those wording, it's easier to focus the matter, and it's obvious that the <em>Gemmara</em> simply tells us, that there is no flogging punishment in the written Tora for having intercourse relationships in plain view, <strong>yet he was flogged</strong>,  due to Rabbnical law (as opposed to Tora law), \"because the hour required it\".</p>\n\n\n",

To quote a little from the beginning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Part Three, On Divine Inspiration and Prophecy\n1Regarding holy spirit (divine inspiration): Behold that the Creator, may He be blessed, implanted into man's nature that he can learn, understand and be enlightened by observing [various] entities and their characteristics. And from what is revealed in front of him, he can contemplate and deduce that which is not revealed - until he grasps it and masters it. And this is the natural way of comprehension. However He also decreed that there be another type of comprehension that is much superior to this. And that is the comprehension that is [divinely] inspired: That is that an influence from Him, may He blessed, comes to one through certain means that He set up for this. And when this influence reaches his intellect, clear knowledge of a certain thing is implanted in it. So he will know the thing completely, [along] with its causes and its outcomes - everything according to its level. And this matter is called holy spirit.<br />\n2Things grasped by holy spirit: And note that in this way, one may grasp matters that are within the category of natural comprehension - just with greater clarity, as we have written. But he can also grasp matters that are not in the category of what can be grasped by natural comprehension. Included in those things are future events and hidden matters.<br />\n3Sparking of holy spirit in its absence: However, there are different levels found in the thing - in the matter of the power of the flow of the influences, in the way that it comes to a man and in the nature of the things that are revealed and made known through it. Yet in all of them, the influence exists in such a way that the one influenced is fully aware of it. However it can also happen that an influence will flow into the heart of a man, such that he will master the content of a certain matter but will not feel from it that he is influenced, but rather feel like someone who had a thought occur to him. And sometimes - in the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed - this is [also] called the holy spirit, or hidden influence, by way of extension. Nevertheless true holy spirit is clearly recognizable and felt by its holder.<br />\n4Regarding prophecy: Yet there is another level above all of this, and that is prophecy. And its content is that a man reaches to connect with the Creator, may His name be blessed, and truly cleave to Him in such a way that he feels the cleaving, and grasps that to which he is cleaving - meaning to His glory, may He be blessed - according to the way we shall explain below. And the thing is clear and perceived by him without any doubt, in the same way that he would have no doubts about something physical that he perceives with his senses. Note that the essence of prophecy is the attainment of this cleaving and connection while he is still alive, which is certainly a great perfection. However accompanying this is [also] information and understandings. For through this, he is truly able to grasp very great and true matters from His hidden secrets, may He be blessed. And he grasps them with clarity through the path of influenced understanding that we mentioned - with greater power than someone who is in possession of the holy spirit, as we will still discuss with God's help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why a Stumah Break Between Coveting Another's Wife and Other Possessions, if they are the Same Commandment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Jewish way of numbering the 10 commandments, all the \"do not covets\" are part of the same commandment (that is, the 10th commandment.) However, in the text there is a stuma break between coveting another's wife and coveting another's possessions. This would seem to suggest they are separate in some ways. Have rabbinical commentaries said anything about why the stuma break is there? Or about why we number it the way we do despite the stuma break?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>This is a concern specifically in the version of the Aseret HaDibrot in Devarim 5 (Parshat Vaetchanan), and not in the version found in Shemot 20 (Parshat Yitro).</p>\n<p>In Yitro, there is no break between the different sections of 'Do not covet'.  There is also no parsha break between \"I am the Lord your G-d...\" (verse 2) and \"You shall have no other gods\" (verse 3-6).  Otherwise there are parsha breaks between each of of the 'dibrot', including those found in a single verse (verse 13).  So here there are only 9 parshiot and a desire for 10 Dibrot.</p>\n<p>In Vaetchanan, there is a stuma break within verse 18, as you note.  The parsha breaks are otherwise the same, in that \"I am the Lord\" and \"You shall have no other\" are in a single parsha.  This creates 10 parshiot and 10 Dibrot.  These line up with what I think of as the Christian ordering, though there may be Jewish sources that count this way, where the first commandment/dibra includes both \"I am the Lord...\" and \"You shall have no other...\", the Ninth is not to covet a wife and the 10th not to covet other things.  The other dibrot are not disputed that I am aware of beyond the count changing if \"You shall have no other\" is the second or part of the first.</p>\n<p>Counting this way fits the Devarim section better in that it fits with parsha breaks.  However, it creates problems in the Shemot text as then Shemot (seemingly the primary place for mentioning the Aseret HaDibrot) mixes not coveting wives into the middle of not coveting possessions.  It also creates a problem with the derivation late in Makkot that there are 613 mitzvot.  That relies on there being 2 mitzvot in the section that was taught directly by G-d, and that section is presumably where G-d speaks in first person  rather than in third person.  That shift occurs between \"You shall have no other G-d's before <strong>Me</strong>...\"   and \"Do not take the Lord's name in vain\".  One could claim even if it is one dibra that it contains two mitzvot, just as there are mitzvah counters who do not count Anochi as a mitzvah even though they do count it as a dibra.</p>\n\n\n",

When we experience ‘too much’ of the latter, we may feel we have lost face forever; the facet of Hashem is a thing of the past. Therefore, the verse ends with \"Hashem is One,\" meaning justice and mercy are not objective opposites. They are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

She said to him: The Exilarch and all the Sages in his house have been sitting in a stolen sukka. She claimed that the Exilarch’s servants stole her wood and used it to build the sukka. She screamed, but Rav Naḥman did not pay attention to her. She said to him: A woman whose father, Abraham, our forefather, had three hundred and eighteen slaves screams before you, and you do not pay attention to her? Rav Naḥman said to the Sages: This woman is a screamer, and she has rights only to the monetary value of the wood. However, the sukka itself was already acquired by the Exilarch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Aruch Laner's rendering, Rav Nachman could not tell her the halacha, since monetary matters may not be judged on Yom Tov, and he therefore ignored her. However, once she began disrespecting the Exilarch, he he taught the ruling to his students as a (theoretical) piece of Torah and allowed her to overhear. This subterfuge was only allowed since the dignity of the Exilarch was at stake.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the publisher says that after reading it, it's guaranteed to be from the Ramchal. Even though this is the publisher's opinion, they didn't want you to take their word for it, so they wrote on the cover מיסודו של הרמח\"ל, not definitively writing that he was the author, and the reader will determine for themselves if the writing style proves the Ramchal wrote it.</p>\n<p>The publisher adds that this manuscript is a Spanish (?, they write ספרדי) manuscript, and the copyist made a lot of typos.

There's also no mention of it being from a ספרדי copyist, so I don't know if that's the publisher's own evaluation (see there where they say there's typos based on <em>havara</em>), or JTS told them orally.</p>\n\n\n",

DoubleAA pointed out another name that's shared by three individuals in the Torah: Reuel, as documented in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/3199/2\">this answer</a>.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://a.eliram.net/bible_records\" rel=\"noreferrer\">It turns out</a> the most common name in the Tanach is Zecharayahu:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A Kohen in the time of David (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.15.24?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:15:24</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A Levite in the time of David (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.15.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:15:18</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A gate-keeper in Ohel Moed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.26.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:26:2</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Son of Yishiyah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.24.25?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:24:25</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Father of Yado (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.27.21?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:27:21</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Father of Yachziel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.20.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:20:14</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Son of Yehoshafat (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.21.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:21:2</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A prophet in the time of Uzziah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.26.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:26:5</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Father of Aviah, mother of Chizkiyahu (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.29.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:29:1</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A man from the Tribe of Reuven (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.5.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:5:7</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Son of Yerov'am II (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.15.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Melachim 2:15:8</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Son of Yevarchiyahu [AKA Zechariah the Prophet] (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.8.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 8:2</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A descendant of Asaf (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.29.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:29:13</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A Kohen in the time of Yoshiyahu (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.35.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:35:8</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[Note: if you count Zecharyah as the same name as Zecharyahu (which in the case of some individuals, it is), then there are several more individuals to add to the list]</p>\n<p>[Note 2: the source I linked says that Zecharyahu is tied with Meshulam, however, when I looked in the concordance, it said that only 13 individuals are named Meshulam]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I believe (although I have no source) that Chanoch is the most common name in the Torah.</p>\n<p>We have Chanoch:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Son of Kayin (Bereishit 4:17)</li>\n<li>Son of Yered (Bereishit 5:18)</li>\n<li>Son of Midian (Bereishit 25:4)</li>\n<li>Son of Reuven (Bereishit 46:9)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

(The initial idea that they write a gemora was the suggestion of Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky)</p>\n<p>Some of the Gedolim who primarily dealt with the more learned crowd were opposed due to the fear that \"when there is an easier  option the harder one becomes impossible\" and the Artscroll Gemara would cause many people to lose their ability to understand Gemara without it. None of them said so in very public forums.</p>\n<p>Rav Shach was opposed to it for the reason given above. He considered saying so publicly but decided not to after speaking to  Gedolim who supported Artscroll .</p>\n<p>Rav Aharon Schechter in his long haskama heavily stresses his opinion that Artscroll should only refer to themselves as the Artscroll <em>explanation</em> rather than a translation.Because  while an  explanation is subject to debate,  translation implies that Artscroll is a definitive authority of what the Gemara really means. He felt they should make it clear that they aren't.</p>\n<p>In general both the Gedolim on the supporting and opposing side agreed that there is some validity to what other side is saying. Almost none would say it is a good idea for a regular Yeshiva Bocher to learn from an Artscroll Gemara. The Yeshivas of those who wrote haskamas for the Artscroll Gemara for the most part do not have any Artscroll Gemaras themselves.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the autobiography of Rav Gifter zt\"l by Rabbi Yechiel Spiro, (Mesorah Publications -  2011), pp.166-167 it writes about a reception that was held following the publication of Megillas Koheles (the third book of tanach that Artscroll released) where Rav Gifter made a point of meeting the two editors Rav Zlotowitz and Rav Scherman - it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Not only did he offer his encouragement, he even offered to read and comment on manuscripts in progress, which he did for several years. He was truly the father of the Artscroll series, foreseeing its potential when few others did, and providing indispensable support in its fledgling years. At every new initiative, his guidance and public involvement were essential elements of its success, especially regarding the Artscroll/Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud, the impact of which he foresaw from the start.</em></p>\n<p><em>When Artscroll/Mesorah Publications first undertook the daunting task of translating the Gemara in the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud, there were those who felt it could not be done properly. As such, there was a disagreement among the giants of Torah Jewry as to whether the project should continue. Rav Elazar Shach, rosh yeshivah of Ponevezh in Israel, was one of those who shared these concerns. But Rav Gifter, who valued Rav Shach's opinion as the authority of the Torah world, campaigned avidly for Rav Shach to allow the project to continue</em></p>\n<p><em>He felt that he knew American Jewry and understood the importance of such an undertaking. He knew the benefits and understood the concerns. Nevertheless, he felt quite strongly that the project should proceed. Rav Shach acquiesced; he trusted Rav Gifter's insights and perspectives. He had no personal agenda, just the pursuit of kvod haTorah.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You can see various approbations from gedolim in the introduction.

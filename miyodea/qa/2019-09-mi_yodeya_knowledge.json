    "content": "# Understanding the reasoning of the woman who agreed with King Solomon to \"cut the baby in half\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a famous story in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.16-28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I Kings 3:16-28</a> about Shlomo Hamelech.<br>\nTwo women who had just given birth around the same time appeared before him; one baby had died and one was alive and the women were arguing about who's baby was the live one.   </p>\n\n<p>Shlomo proposed to cut the baby in half and give half to each woman, to which they responded:<br>\n(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I Kings 3:26</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Woman A:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>וַתֹּ֣אמֶר ׀ בִּ֣י אֲדֹנִ֗י תְּנוּ־לָהּ֙ אֶת־הַיָּל֣וּד הַחַ֔י וְהָמֵ֖ת אַל־תְּמִיתֻ֑הוּ<br>\n  “Please, my lord,” she cried, “give her the live child; only don’t kill it!” </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Woman B:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>וְזֹ֣את אֹמֶ֗רֶת גַּם־לִ֥י גַם־לָ֛ךְ לֹ֥א יִהְיֶ֖ה גְּזֹֽרוּ<br>\n  The other insisted, “It shall be neither yours nor mine; cut it in two!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The story concludes with Shlomo revealing that Woman A was proven to be the mother since she'd rather have her child taken away and live than die.</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>Was Woman B a dimwit? Did she not know that Shlomo's suggestion would result in a dead child?  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>related</strong>: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/96945/how-would-the-split-the-baby-in-half-situation-be-resolved-according-to-halach\">cut baby in half in halacha</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 37)\n\n<p>I generally understood the story based on the Malbim: obviously, everyone involved (including \"Woman B,\" as you call her) knew that King Solomon's suggestion would result in the death of the child. After all, the second woman says גם לי גם לך לא יהיה - neither of us would end up with a child. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, the question was what do each of these woman <em>really</em> want out of this trial? Woman A (the child's mother) is obviously most interested in keeping her baby, but King Solomon recognized that the other woman was motivated by a desire to even the scales: she was upset by the fact that her child had died while her companion's child was alive. As they say in English, \"<a href=\"https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/misery+loves+company\" rel=\"noreferrer\">misery loves company</a>,\" or in Hebrew, <a href=\"http://forum.otzar.org/viewtopic.php?t=19841\" rel=\"noreferrer\">צרת רבים חצי נחמה</a>. The woman who was not the baby's mother wouldn't actually have said out loud that she wanted her friend's baby to die, and so Solomon had devised this \"test\" in order to get her to express what she was really after. </p>\n\n<p>Here's the commentary of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Malbim</strong></a> to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.22?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_I_Kings.3.22&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I Kings 3:22</a>, who shows that the wording of each of the two women tipped off King Solomon to the solution: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ותאמר האשה האחרת לא כי בני החי ובנך המת וזאת אומרת לא כי בנך המת ובני החי</strong>, ספר הכתוב כי בדברם, אמרה הנתבעת בלשון <strong>בני החי ובנך המת</strong>\n  והתובעת אמרה בהפך <strong>בנך המת ובני החי</strong>, וכלל בלשון שהאדם יקדים תמיד מה\n  שהוא העקר ויאחר את הטפל ולפ''ז הסברא נותנת שהאשה שדקדקה להקדים בלשונה\n  <strong>בני החי</strong> קודם עקר מגמתה שיהיה החי בנה, והמקדמת בלשונה <strong>בנך המת</strong> עקר מגמתה שיהיה המת בן חברתה, לא שיהיה החי בנה, ומזה כבר היה יכול\n  להבין ולהכריע מי אמו</p>\n  \n  <p>\"<strong>The other woman said, 'no rather it is my son who is alive and your\n  son who is dead,' and this one says 'no rather it is your son who is\n  dead and my son who is alive</strong>.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>Scripture tells how regarding their words, by one claimant using the\n  language of \"<strong><em>my son is alive and your son is dead</strong>,\"</em> and the\n  other claimant saying [in] the reverse [order], \"<strong><em>your son is dead\n  and my son is alive</em></strong>.\" There is a rule in man's language that he\n  will always give precedent to what is primary and make later what is\n  secondary, and therefore it is reasonable that the woman who was\n  careful to give precedence in her words to <strong><em>my son is alive</em></strong>-her\n  main objective is that her son be alive, and the [other woman] who\n  gave precedence to <strong><em>your son is dead</em></strong>- her main objective was to\n  say that the dead son was her companion's, but not that her son was\n  the live one. And from this [Solomon] was already able to understand\n  and discern who is his mother</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, once it was clear to Solomon that the second woman was more interested in making sure that her fellow was the one subject to having a dead child, he was able to exploit that fact by showing that she would be fine with such a verdict - even at the expense of a child's life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meiri</a> asks and answers this question in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevamot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamos</a> 17b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והוא הענין שנאמר בהגדה על אותן שתים נשים זונות שבאו לדין לפני שלמה שהרי כשצוה שלמה לגזור את הילד החי והשיבה האחת תנו לה את הילוד החי והמת אל תמיתוהו היה ראוי לאחרת להשיב את שלי היא נותנת לי וכשאמרה גם לי גם לך גו' סכלות היה ופתיות שלה ומה היה מכיר שלמה בדבר זה ומה תועלת היה רואה לה בדבריה <strong>אלא ששתי נשים אלו כלה וחמותה היו ומתו בעליהן בלא בנים אחרים אלא אלו השנים ומת ילד זה של הכלה וכל שמת תוך שלשים נדון כנפל והרי היא זקוקה ליבום וכשמצאה עצמה צריכה להמתין לאותו ולד של חמותה ותתעגן י\"ג שנים החליפה חי במת כדי לומר שבנה הוא ותפטר משני צדדין שהרי תאמר שיש לה בן ואין לה יבם וכשאמר שלמה גזרו את הילד החי שמחה מפני שנוח היה לה בכך כדי לינשא בהיתר</strong> והרגיש שלמה בענין זה והשאירו לחמותה</p>\n<p>The two women were mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and their husbands had died before having any other children other than these two. The daughter-in-law's son had died within 30 days of being born, which would be considered a <em><a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-10-the-passing-of-an-infant-nefel-stillborn-miscarriage/#1-the-definition-of-a-nefel2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nefel</a></em> and would not exempt her from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yibum</a>. Therefore the daughter-in-law would have to wait until the mother-in-law's child (her husband's new barely contemporary brother) to reach 13 years old in order to do <em>Yibum</em> or <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chalitza</a></em>, and she would remain an <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agunah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Agunah</a></em> until then, unable to get married. Instead, she switched her child with her mother-in-law's child, this way she could be exempt from <em>Yibum</em> by having a surviving child (and no <em>Yavam</em>). When Shlomo said to cut the baby in half, the daughter-in-law approved of this because it would still allow her to get remarried as there would be no <em>Yavam</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is a diagram which may help clarify:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mA9Pa.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mA9Pa.png\" alt=\"Family Tree\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>She was calling the king's bluff.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the story goes against the universal one, but fits with the text and answers your question and a lot of others --</p>\n\n<p>Woman A (the one holding the live child) was trying to be demonstrative of how motherly she was, expecting to be allowed to keep the child, even though she was saying that she would let the other one take the baby.</p>\n\n<p>Woman B (the real mother) felt trapped. She can't say \"yes, I will take the baby\", because then Woman A will be allowed to keep the baby for being more \"motherly\". Obviously she can't now say, \"no, you keep the baby\". So Woman A passes the play back to Shlomo. Shlomo never meant to kill the child, and neither did Woman A.</p>\n\n<p>גם לי גם לך לא יהיה - I will not take the child, and neither will you - I will not play along with your fake offer for me to take the child, and I do not accept that you should be given the child for it.</p>\n\n<p>Shlomo actually gave the baby to Woman B, and not to the one who was willing to let the other take the baby. Woman A was a show off, Woman B was authentic. </p>\n\n<p>There is a vague pronoun reference when the king says, \"Give her the child\". Though it is always understood to be referring to the Woman A, grammatically it should refer to the last one who spoke, i.e. Woman B.</p>\n\n<p>This obviously quite shocked all who were present, who \"stood in awe of the king; for they saw that he possessed divine wisdom to execute justice.\"</p>\n\n\n",

It is found in the commentary of the Rogatchover Gaon to the Chumash, parshat Acharei Mot, 18:2 quoting Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi from the Sifra 13:4 which says that G-d knew that in the end Israel would be broken, disrupted and disconnected through <em>prohibited sexual relationships</em>. (לינתק בעריות) That their exposure to this type of sin (<em>during their enslavement</em> <em>and exile</em>) would damage and corrupt them (<em>much like severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</em>). And the Rogatchover points explicitly to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.63b.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 63b</a> and the quote of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav who says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: <strong>The Jewish people</strong> knew that idol worship is of no substance; they did not actually believe in it. And they <strong>worshipped idols only in order to permit themselves to engage in forbidden sexual relations in public</strong>, <em><strong>since most rituals of idol worship would include public displays of forbidden sexual intercourse</strong></em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That (<em>exposure to</em>) sin causes sin. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.25.1.1?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And this was actually the advice that Bilaam gave to Balak</a> after failing to curse the Jewish people during the first redemption.

It points out that these types of practices are considered a spiritual pollution of the individual and that this spiritual pollution of the individual also results in the pollution of surrounding physical environment to such an extent that the surrounding environment (<em>literally the land</em>) will no longer support them and will eventually vomit them out!

Like is emphasized within the Torah in regard to the concept of the first commandment: <strong>to be fruitful and multiply</strong>, meaning the perpetuation of the species, <strong>diversification and increase of life is a primary sign of a healthy and thriving environment</strong>. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.22?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:22</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.28?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:28</a>)</p>\n<p>The political justification of the LGBTQ+ movement is all about <em>diversity</em>, but in alignment with <em>the opposite of life</em>.</p>\n<p>This is the underlying message from the Torah about the causes behind the mass extinction event recounted in connection with Noach and the flood.

In Sifra 13:9 it also connects this to the concept of <em>passing sons and daughters through the flames of Molach.</em> (Devarim 18:10)</p>\n<p>Essentially this is the wasting of ones reproductive potential, which is comprised of both sons and daughters, by indulging irrationally in obsessive excess with the <em>flames</em> of natural sexual desire (this desire is something G-d created for a blessing and for good in connection to the reproduction and preservation of the species, meaning the commandment to <em>Be fruitful and multiply</em>). Like G-d told to Adam HaRishon, he was to do this commandment and to preserve and guard it! (Bereshit 2:15)</p>\n<p>In the commentary of the Raavad to Sifra 13:9 he emphasizes that any of the customs and practices like excessive preoccupation with personal grooming and beautification associated with these prohibited sexual behaviors are included in the prohibition against following the ways of the Amorites.</p>\n<p>And Rabbi Meir also explains that this activity is associated with the Amorites, <em>who are also connected with the Amalekites</em> and their allies in Sodom and Gomorrah.

    "content": "# Is one allowed to continue riding in a vehicle driven by a Gentile on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In reading <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12332/5275\">this answer</a>, I understand that there is no concern with riding on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that you are driving your car before Shabbat and you have a Gentile passenger. You won't reach your destination before Shabbat. Just before the start of Shabbat, can you switch drivers and have the Gentile drive your car and you be the passenger?</p>\n\n<p>I know that you cannot benefit from a Gentile doing melacha. However, here, the Gentile is driving your car for his own benefit, as he also wants to get to the same place as you do. You just happen to be the passenger, now. Is there a problem with his driving the car? Also, once he's arrived, can he turn off the car, as now, it seems that having the motor off seems to be for your benefit - it's your car, not his?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Assuming your assumption is correct, i.e. that riding in a car is the same as riding the subway.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can you switch drivers and have the Gentile drive your car and you be the passenger?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Possibly. There is a Mishna in Shabbat that you can give your valuables to a non-Jew to carry.</p>\n\n<p>But... you have a problem with Techumim. I.e. if you're outside Techum Shabbat<sup>**</sup> of your destination then when you get out the car you will be limited to walking 4 Amoth. Since subways don't leave town, it isn't mentioned there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I know that you cannot benefit from a Gentile doing melacha. However, here, the Gentile is driving your car for his own benefit, as he also wants to get to the same place as you do. You just happen to be the passenger, now. Is there a problem with his driving the car? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming that he also needs to go to the same destination, then it sounds OK. Compare to the Mishna of the no-Jewish sailor making a ramp for the Rabbis to leave the boat.</p>\n\n<p>But if he's going to detour to drop you off then it's probably forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Also add the problem of how to get out the car. Opening doors will possibly cause lights to go on, on the dashboard and the ceiling; you'd need to ask the non-Jew to let you out, possibly in an indirect manner. (<code>Um, how does one open this door?</code> may not be allowed since one cannot mention the <em>forbidden act</em> in the hint .)</p>\n\n<p>This again is not an issue in a subway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Also, once he's arrived, can he turn off the car, as now, it seems that having the motor off seems to be for your benefit - it's your car, not his?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, you can't ask him to turn off the motor, but you don't have to stop him from doing so. Compare to the Halacha of a non-Jew who wants to extinguish a fire in your property. (As a general rule, extinguishing is <em>easier</em> than other Melachot, since it's a Melacha She'eino Tzricha L'Gufo.)</p>\n\n<p><sup>*</sup> Not sure the comparison is valid, since, for example, your weight is negligible in a subway, but significant in a car.  You don't have the issue of opening doors, turning off engines and other potential trouble spots.</p>\n\n<p><sup>**</sup> In a nutshell: If you're 1Km outside the city limits when Shabbat starts (at dusk? nighfall? twilight? - that a topic for another question). City limits are defined rather generously; draw a square around the city that includes all lived-in building plus 70 Amoth around them. but in a car at 60 Km/h if you're 2 minutes away and cannot see the city, you're probably outside the techum.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yehoshua, on the other hand, says: Divide the day, half of it for eating and drinking and half of it for the study hall, for he holds that eating and drinking are obligatory on the Festival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some follow the former - חציו לה' and therefore do what the soul enjoys \"de-jure\" (as stated by the sages), drinking and eating meat even if they don't like it, some follow חציו לנו - and enjoy the body, and replace the food they don't like with foods they do.</p>\n<p>Some hold that as the person's table represents the Altar, the meat and the wine represent the Yom Tov sacrifices before Hashem.</p>\n<p>If I remember right, most Poskim follow the second (not obligating) but some follow the first (yours truly).

See for example\nShmirat Shabbat KeHilchatah (ibid 19) that birth control pills are not\nforbidden, and the footnote there (in the Hebrew edition) explains\nthat <strong>only cases where someone is in physical pain or weakness is\nforbidden to take medicines</strong>. It could be that they have the law of a\nhealthy person, in which case the taking of medicines is the subject\nof debate (see the Shulchan Aruch ibid, 37, and the Mishna Brurah\n120). Even those generally strict on this question (ie. the\nAshkenazim) could take the lenient opinion as an extra reason for\nleniency, together with the other reasons I cite.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Thirdly, <strong>the\nmedicines for ADHD that exist today do not cure the condition - they\nmerely treat the symptoms of hyperactivity and lack of ability to\nconcentrate.

Lastly, there is much\ndiscussion about the extent to which this rabbinic decree is still in\nforce today when the underlying reasoning for it (ie that one may be\nled to grind the plants to make the medicine) does not seem to apply\nany more. (See the Tzitz Eliezer, volume 8, 15, 15 for a lengthy\ndiscussion of this issue). Even though all the modern day poskim hold\nthat we do apply this decree, there is room to take the lenient\nrulings together with long-term medications such as in the case of\nADHD.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a followup, I have now explicitly seen in R Avrohom Yaged's <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422638224.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">guide to refuah on Shabbos</a> that he writes (p. 62 and also p. 84)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A person who has been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD may take medicine for\nit, even though he is not actually sick. Because he cannot function\nnormally without his medicine, he is considered a <em>choleh</em> in this\nregard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As @Shokhet mentioned in comments, it's very important idea to ask a knowledgeable rabbi for guidance in real cases. Individual circumstances differ greatly, and (especially with regard to psychiatric medication) what is optional for one person may be life-or-death for another (with obvious implications for issues surrounding Shabbos).</p>\n\n\n",

However, I read this in Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 27:20:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומקום הנחת תפילין של ראש מהתחלת עיקרי השיער שעל המצח עד סוף המקום\n  שמוחו של תינוק רופס ויש להזהיר לההמון על ככה, כאשר ראינו בעינינו שרבים\n  נושאים השל ראש חציו על המצח. ואוי לאותו בושה, כי לא קיימו מצות תפילין\n  מימיהם, ומברכים לבטלה, ועונשם גדול</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summarizing the above:</p>\n\n<p>The proper place for the tefillin shel Rosh is from the top of the hairline until the point of where a baby's forehead is soft. One should be especially careful about placing the tefillin in the proper place, for if not, this is a terrible embarrassment to the mitzvah, they have made a blessing in vain and the punishment is great.</p>\n\n<p>My question - the tefillin shel rosh strap is one size. Are the Chaba\"d shlichim adjusting the strap for each person's head before they have that person say the bracha? If they aren't, how can they let that person say the bracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As pointed out by @Noach in the chat, the Chabad minhag is to say only one beracha on tefilin. That is they say the beracha of lihaniach tefilin before tightening the tefilin shel yad, and no beracha on the tefilin shel rosh, unless one spoke or otherwise interrupted between the one tefila and the other. (This is also the Sefardic minhag. The Ashkenazi minhag is to always say the beracha of al mitzvas tefilin before putting on the shel rosh.)</p>\n\n<p>A second point that must be kept in mind is that the two tefilin are two separate mitzvos, and one can fulfill one without the other. (O.C. siman 26)</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, the Chabadnick does not need to be overly concerned about the tefilin shel roash. Of course he will try to make sure that it is tight and in the proper place, and probably would adjust the knot if it were obviously too big. But even if the shel rosh is not put on correctly, since no beracha is made, the one putting on tefilin is only better off that if the Chabadnick hadn't come along, having certainly fulfilled the mitzva of TSY and maybe also TSR without a safek beracha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe they typically have multiple Tefillin bags at their booths for different head sizes and they are quite good at adjusting the knot on the shel rosh if needed. I believe they put Tefillin on people based on the Shulchan Aruch Harav and am not aware of any heter kiruv on this point that they hold by.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is some amount of space between the hairline as the forward most boundary and the fontanelle as the back boundary.  It is presumably possible to size tefillin such that they will be in this range on most people, closer to the hairline on small heads, closer to the fontanelle on large ones.  On my own head, it feels as if I can just barely fit 4 fingers in this range.  Granted, because the tefillin must be entirely within these boundaries, one must deduct the size of the tefillin themselves from the range of acceptability (if there is say 3 inches of space, and tefillin are 2 inches, there is an inch between the furthest back tefillin may be and the furthest forward.)</p>\n\n<p>There is a chart <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1793909/?page=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> of head circumferences in adults, which seems to be, somewhat unsurprisingly, a factor of height.  Assuming one wants to get say the middle 50% of head sizes in men of all heights considered in that study, one finds only a range of 56 to 60 cm.  </p>\n\n<p>So there isn't huge variation in head size, and there is a range of acceptable sizes for any given man, so an average sized tefillin should fit most men.  </p>\n\n<p>The people who stand in public places encouraging men to put on tefillin are also well practiced at adjusting them.  </p>\n\n\n",

So a Nazirite vow would not restrict me.</p>\n\n<p>Why does our tradition associate asceticism with specific actions, which are not meaningful to everybody, instead of associating it with practices that are tailor-made to the individual, and therefore vary from one person to another?  Is this addressed in the Sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you're over-simplifying the Nazarite restrictions, as you call them. I always thought of them as prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take them in the order you did:</p>\n\n<h2>Wine</h2>\n\n<p>While you may like wine, Jews need to make Kiddush and Havdala weekly. For this they need wine. (Regarding a Nazarite and most other Halachot, there's no distinction between grape juice and wine).</p>\n\n<p>So thrice weekly (if not more often) you're going to be <em>deprived</em>. You'll need somebody to make Kiddush for you or somehow make Kiddush without wine.</p>\n\n<p>You're also forgetting that in Biblical times, until Coke was invented ;-) the main drink served at meals was wine.</p>\n\n<h2>Haircuts</h2>\n\n<p>I suspect that having to grow one's hair was more about the symbolism of <em>shaving it all off</em> at the end of the period rather than it being a restriction.</p>\n\n<p>This can possibly be proven from the Mishna (Nozir 5:6) that if a Nazarite cuts his hair then he cannot do the <em>graduation ceremony</em> unless he hasn't shaved for 30 days. Furthermore, a Nazarite vow is for 30 days, unless specified otherwise at the time of the vow. Hardly <em>ponytail</em> material.</p>\n\n<h2>Cemeteries</h2>\n\n<p>In Biblical times everybody kept away from cemeteries - even an Am HaAretz (a non-Rabbinical Jew) - is assumed to not have Tumat Met - impurity caused by corpses. </p>\n\n<p>If they became impure they would need to get sprinkled with Para Aduma water. The first batch was made by Moshe and the second batch by Ezra - that's about a millennium later, to give you an idea of how rarely it was used.</p>\n\n<p>Being impure meant you were restricted in your Mitzvah observance and your life in general: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You couldn't go into the Temple, something you needed to do at least thrice yearly.</li>\n<li>You couldn't eat sacrificial meat.</li>\n<li>You couldn't take Halla from your dough and needed to have somebody else do it for you. </li>\n<li>You'd have to be careful what utensils you touched and sat on so that you wouldn't cause them impurity, rendering them unfit for use by most of the population. </li>\n<li>Most people wouldn't appreciate being touched by you, as you would cause them some level of impurity.</li>\n<li>And the list goes on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Back to the Nazarite</strong>. He had to be constantly aware of his surroundings. He couldn't enter a building complex unless he ascertained that all its inhabitants were well and alive and not on their death bed.</p>\n\n<p>He couldn't simply walk into a hospital. He couldn't go to funerals. </p>\n\n<p>This was not simply \"taking walks in cemeteries\" - even taking a simple walk he had to ascertain that the shady trees were not overhanging a grave on the other side of the wall.</p>\n\n<h2>Asceticism </h2>\n\n<p>I also think you're focusing on only the second half of the dictionary definition of <em>asceticism</em>: <code>severe self-discipline AND avoidance of all forms of indulgence, typically for religious reasons.</code></p>\n\n<p>I think the Torah's definition would be more like: severe self-discipline <strong>through</strong> avoidance of certain forms of indulgence.</p>\n\n<p>The point being that a Nazarite is on a self-improvement program, by having to be aware of his actions and surroundings all the time.</p>\n\n\n",

See the 2nd paragraph. </p>\n\n<p>Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this week’s parshah (Breishit 31:30), Lavan says to Yakov: nichsof\n  nichsafta le-veit avicha—you longed for your father’s house. The two\n  words nichsof and nichsafta are both from the root KSF, the same room\n  as KSF, money.</p>\n  \n  <p>Most likely, the verb KSF originally meant “to become pale with\n  longing.” And the noun KSF did not originally mean “money.” Rather, it\n  meant “silver.” Why did silver get this name? Because of its\n  whiteness, it became known as the “pale metal.” So the commonality\n  between “silver” and “longing” is the whiteness/paleness aspect, and\n  not anything else. I followed Ernest Klein: “A Comprehensive\n  Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language,” p. 282</p>\n  \n  <p>Another widely used etymology book, “Etymological Dictionary of\n  Biblical Hebrew” by Matityahu Clark, takes a slightly different\n  approach. It views the fundamental meaning of KSF as “yearn, desire”\n  and then views silver as a “desired asset.” But why should only silver\n  be desired, why not gold? And why are not all precious metals called\n  kesef? The better approach is the one taken by Klein, which focuses on\n  the paleness aspect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later on, the word became to mean \"money\", but that's not its original meaning. Languages change for various reasons, and I suspect that since silver was originally used as a means to conduct business transactions, it was thought of as \"currency\" until paper notes and other metals were substituted.</p>\n\n\n",

The Angels didn't want G-d's Torah to be taken down into the coarse and lowly material world, or as you describe it, the working world.</p>\n\n<p>But G-d told Moses to answer them as it is recorded there in the Talmud.

If His intention is for there to be a dwelling place below, which includes, for example, us working for a living, we know and believe that this is only for a blessing and will happen.</p>\n\n<p>Hope to see you again with additional great questions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong><em>How can someone be sure she'll stay the same way in Jewishness whilst working?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The first step in finding a solution to a problem is by recognizing what the problem is.</p>\n\n<p>In your case, you’ve identified the problem, which is that by being more exposed to the outside world, and not having the benefit of Torah classes anymore, there is a potential danger to your Jewishness.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest six areas of endeavor, the steps a person can take to maintain their Jewishness, while and despite having to be in the workplace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1</strong>. The first solution is not to abandon Torah classes, despite having to work. There are many Torah classes, both for men and for women, which take place in the evenings, and are geared to working people. These can serve as an ongoing immunization against the negative spiritual effects of the workplace, and can help contribute to further spiritual growth.</p>\n\n<p>If you can’t find a Torah class that is appropriate for you, you can consider learning with a <a href=\"https://www.partnersintorah.org/#how-it-works\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">telephone study partner</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2</strong>. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>עשה לך רב</strong></a>. It’s extremely important to be connected with a mentor, teacher, rabbi, who can provide continued guidance as to how to deal with challenges as they arise in the workplace, and to be your spiritual compass. People not connected with such a guide, can be slowly deteriorating in their Jewishness, without even realizing it. By being connected with a Torah person, you are thereby able to also stay connected to the Torah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3</strong>. The next solution is by creating appropriate boundaries at work, particularly regarding members of the opposite gender. To this end, I recommend a modest book, entitled <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/A-guide-to-modest-conduct-for-todays-workplace-by-Rabbi-Shmuel-Neiman-/371871667974\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“A Guide to Modest Conduct for Today’s Workplace”</a>, By Rabbi Shmuel Neiman.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4</strong>. One of the most important areas that a person needs to be aware of in the workplace is the issue of <strong>Yichud</strong>. Without a person consciously being careful about it, many workplace settings can develop into Yichud situations; with unfortunate ramifications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5</strong>. In addition, the modern world being what it is, and the promiscuous manner that people dress, it often becomes difficult for people to keep their minds from wandering. Many people are aware of the need to be \"<strong>shomer negia</strong>\", which refers to guarding oneself from inappropriate physical contact with a person of the opposite gender, but less people are aware of the need for \"<strong>shmiras einayim</strong>\". This includes guarding one's eyes from gazing at inappropriate things and letting one's mind wander. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi (Bamidbar 15:39) brings the words of Chazal: The heart and the eyes are spies for the body. The eye sees, the heart desires, and the body commits the sin (Rashi). Unfortunately, in most workplaces, this is a daily issue, ALL DAY!</p>\n\n<p><strong>6</strong>. Beware of the enemy. By being cognizant and continuously remembering the fact that you’re living a potential minefield, you will be more attuned to the issues that present themselves, and remain inspired to continue to maintain your level of Jewishness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud teaches (Yoma 38b) that <strong>בא לטהר מסייעין אותו</strong>, if someone comes to purify themselves they merit special assistance from Heaven. </p>\n\n<p>By asking this question, you’ve indicated that you’re a person who is seeking to purify themselves. In addition, by constantly implementing the suggestions made here, you will be actively pursuing spiritual purity. May you thereby merit special assistance from Heaven, to be able to remain a pure Torah Jew!</p>\n\n\n",

Although he who does put his fellow to shame is not flogged, it is a grievous sin. Even so did the wise men say: \"He who publicly puts his fellow's countenance to shame has no share in the world to come\" (Pirke Abot, 3.15). A man is, therefore obliged to guard himself against putting his fellow to shame publicly, regardless of whether he be young or old; not to call him by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor tell aught in his presence of which he is ashamed. However, all these refer to matters touching the relationship between man and man; but if it concern heavenly matters, if the sinner does not repent after being rebuked privately, he should be shamed publicly, and his sin should be proclaimed, and harsh words should be used in his presence, and he should be shamed and cursed till he repent and take up the good path, even as all of the prophets in Israel did with the wicked.8Baba Mezi’a 59a; Yoma, 86b.

(The g'mara explains that this is if he needs it.)

Even though the <em>kohanim</em> made a rule that it has to be a Levi and not a Yisrael, there are lots of Levi'im.  Were they <em>all</em> at the temple except the one leading the goat, and that's why they couldn't make a substitution?  But, if that's the reason, wouldn't substituting a Yisrael be a lesser transgression (it only violates a human rule) than having somebody eat and drink (which violates a torah law)?

    "content": "# Is there a practical difference between different ways of food becoming obligated in ma'aser?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tithes.3.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aser 3:3</a>), apparently based on the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ma'asrot.18b?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'asrot 4:1</a>), lists six things that make food fixed (קבע) in the obligation for ma'aser: bringing it into a courtyard, buying/selling, fire, salt, separating teruma, and Shabbat (the Ra'avad says he should have also added pickling). Later (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tithes.4.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:2</a>) he clarifies that all these things, except for bringing into the house, are forbidden from the rabbis.</p>\n\n<p>These thing are all mentioned throughout the Mishna in Ma'asrot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.3.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.4.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:1-3</a>) as making food obligated in ma'aser. However, as presented by the Mishna, there is another thing mentioned throughout (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.2.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.3.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:3</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.3.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:8-10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.4.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:5</a>) that makes food obligated, namely, taking a lot at once. For example, taking more than one fig or grain of barley at a time means that it becomes obligated in ma'aser and it can no longer be eaten informally (עראי). The Rambam also mentions this as the definition of informal eating (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tithes.3.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:19</a>, quoting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.4.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:5</a>), but not as part of the list of six things.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any legal difference between the six things that make produce fixed for ma'aser, and taking many pieces of food at a time? I don't see any such distinction made by the Mishna. But in the Rambam's scheme, it seems from a superficial reading as if he makes a distinction.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Rambam says you can make someone else's produce obligated in ma'aser by doing one of the six things, but he doesn't make this explicit about taking a lot of food together at once (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tithes.3.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aser 3:7</a>). So in this case, a literal reading would be that if you take two of your friend's figs, your friend can still eat them separately without taking ma'aser. This could be reasonable, because (as the Rambam presents it) you're allowed to eat the food informally before one of the six things happen to the food, so it might depend more on the person eating it than on what happens to the food itself. However, the Mishna itself uses for all of these cases the same wording of חייב (which, however, does have two possible meanings: \"he is obligated,\" or \"it is obligated\").</p>\n\n<p>So does the Rambam really mean to distinguish between taking a lot of food together, and other actions that make food fixed for ma'aser? If so, what's the Rambam's source for this distinction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Here is an element of answer. My understanding is based on Gemara BM 88a-89b, Betsa 13 and 34-35. </p>\n\n<p>The owner, when he finished the work, the harvesting is ready,  takes it at home and then he cannot eat without Maaser. But there is an opinion in Gemara, saying that for fruits that need goren before consumption, e.g. wheat, grape that need to become wine, the duty is before the home, it's beginning from the harvesting. For fruits immediately consumable, as grape that needs to be eaten as fruits, the duty begins at home. The Raavad maasrot 4.1 rules as this last opinion.</p>\n\n<p>There is a rabbinic duty, regarding a situation in which the owner doesn't want to take the fruits at home, and someone buy an amount of fruits.In this situation, since the work is finished, and something replaces the home taking, there is a rabbinic duty. This is the opinion of Tosfot 88a, but Rashi explains that for the buyer duty, we don't need the true end of the work, but the Gemara at the begining of the suggia was thinking that there are min Hatora two ends of work, one for the owner and one for the buyer. But in conclusion there is only the goren of the owner who take his fruits at home. There is no fundamental difference between Rashi and Tosfot regarding the explanation of the duty of the buyer. </p>\n\n<p>The end of the work is for the owner who takes fruits at home, is when he brings together all the fruits, or, more accurately, when he begins to make this. If he decides to take the fruits in the market to sell them, he is patur from maaser by the Tora rule, but rabbinically he is chayav. There is  a kind of mini harvesting, rabbinically speaking, when he sells a part of the fruits and want to take at home, afterwards, the major part of the harvesting., To buy a minimum of 2 fruits as Gemara and Tosfot BM 88 d.h Baal Habayit said. </p>\n\n<p>To make a real meal can rabbinically replace the home meal. If the work is finished and the owner eats two fruits, or eats a cooked meal, there is a rabbinic duty.</p>\n\n<p>Several things can make the eating a serious meal. If the fruits became prepared by cooking, or salting, or the timing, if the time is a time of great meal, as Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>For salting (ספיתה) without any duty because of selling, we need also two fruits for gmar melacha. Whe need two fruits to have an opposition against the greet goren, and then, there is Gmar Melacha, and it is called a \"kviut\" before eating with salt. This regards the owner. When there is a selling, we have a gmar Melacha and the selling is a rabbinic equivalent of entering at home. If we have two fruits, without selling and without salting, there is no prohibition to eat, even many fruits, it is still an achilat arayi despite the quantity (BM 89b).  </p>\n\n<p>Mishnayot</p>\n\n<p>2.5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב,ה  האומר לחברו הא לך איסר זה, ותן לי בו חמש תאנים--לא יאכל עד שיעשר, דברי רבי מאיר.  רבי יהודה אומר, אוכל אחת אחת, ופטור; ואם צירף, חייב.  אמר רבי יהודה, מעשה בגינת ורדים שהייתה בירושלים, והיו תאניה נמכרות משלוש ומארבע באיסר; ולא הופרש ממנה תרומה ומעשר מעולם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 2.6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב,ו  האומר לחברו הא לך איסר זה בעשרים תאנים שאבור לי, בורר ואוכל.  באשכול שאבור לי, מגרגר ואוכל.  ברימון שאבור לי, פורט ואוכל.  באבטיח שאבור לי, סופת ואוכל.  אבל אם אמר בעשרים תאנים אלו, בשני אשכולות אלו, בשני רימונים אלו, בשני אבטיחים אלו--אוכל כדרכו ופטור, מפני שקנה במחובר לקרקע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yachin</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פורט\n  עיי' פ\"א נ\"ד. דמדאין המקח נגמר עד אחר שתלשו מקח בתלוש קובע למעשר ואף לאכלו עראי והרי כשתלש איזה מהן נגמ\"ל מדאין לו גמ\"ל אחרת. אבל לגרגר ולפרוט מותר דבכה\"ג לא נגמ\"ל גם לקונה והרי כל ז' הדברים [פ\"א נ\"ג] אין קובעים רק בנגמ\"ל [ועי' רפ\"ג]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Buyng makes a chyuv maaser only if the kinyan is on fruits already separated from the tree, and is after harvesting. When it is the case, informal eating is prohibited before maaser taking. The Mishna is talking about fruits in the garden or the field. The buying replaces the home taking after harvesting. See below Mishna 5.1</p>\n\n<p>Mishne Tora</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה,ב  הלוקח במחובר לקרקע, או שלקח תלוש לשלח לחברו--לא נקבעו, ויש לו לאכול מהן עראי.  [ג] האומר לחברו הא לך איסר זה, ותן לי בו חמש תאנים--הרי זה אוכל אחת אחת, ופטור; ואם צירף, חייב לעשר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 3.2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג,ב  המוציא את פועליו בשדה--בזמן שאין להם עליו מזונות, אוכלין ופטורין; אבל אם יש להם עליו מזונות, אוכלין אחת אחת מן התאנה, אבל לא מן הסל ולא מן הקופה ולא מן המוקצה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 3.3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג,ג  השוכר את הפועל לעשות עימו בזיתים--אמר לו על מנת לאכול בזיתים, אוכל אחת אחת ופטור; ואם צירף, חייב.  לנכש בבצלים--אמר לו על מנת לאכול ירק, מקרטם עלה עלה ואוכל; ואם צירף, חייב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Halachot of the worker are conitioned by a special status, he can eat how many as he wants when he is working at the time of harvesting. But in other times, the Tora doesn't give him this status. So he eats as if he buyed the fruits, and has a din of buyer, and if he accumulates fruits, we have harvesting and buying, he cannot eat, even informally. When he makes with the owner some conditions of eating, regarding quantity, Rashi and Rambam hold that he has a rabbinical status of buyer and cannot accumulate. Rabenu Tam disagrees. </p>\n\n<p>Mishne Tora</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה,יב  [י] שכרו <strong>לנכש</strong> עימו בזיתים, והתנה הפועל שיאכל בזיתים--הרי זה אוכל מן האילן אחת אחת, ופטור; ואם צירף, חייב.  [יא] שכרו לנכש בבצלים, והתנה לאכול ירק--מקרסם עלה עלה, ואוכל; ואם צירף, חייב.</p>\n  \n  <p>[יא] שכרו לנכש בבצלים, והתנה לאכול ירק--מקרסם עלה עלה, ואוכל; ואם צירף, חייב.</p>\n  \n  <p>ה,יג  קצץ הפועל שיאכל ליטרה של זיתים, אוכל אחת אחת; ואם צירף, חייב לעשר   <strong>הואיל והוא אוכל דבר קצוב, הרי זה כלוקח שאם צירף נקבע</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>ה,יד  לא קצץ, אלא היה אוכל בדין תורה--מצרף ואוכל כל מה שירצה:  והוא, שלא יספות במלח.  אבל אם ספת במלח אחת אחת, מותר; שתיים שתיים--אסור, שהרי נקבעו במלח.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 3.8</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג,ח  תאנה שהיא עומדת בחצר--אוכל אחת אחת, ופטור; ואם צירף, חייב.  רבי שמעון אומר, אחת בימינו ואחת בשמאלו ואחת בפיו.  עלה לראשה--ממלא את חיקו, ואוכל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Melechet Shelomo</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אוכל אחת אחת. אבל שתים לא דהוי גרן וראיית פני חצר בבת אחת ובהא מודה ר' טרפון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two fruits from a Fig tree that is in the courtyard, we have harvesting and courtyard, generating together a chyuv, the fruits need terumot and maasrot.  We are speaking even about the owner.</p>\n\n<p>Mishne Tora</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>,יד  [טו] תאנה שהיא עומדת בחצר--אוכל ממנה אחת אחת, ופטור; <strong>ואם צירף</strong>, חייב במעשר.  במה דברים אמורים, בשהיה עומד בקרקע.  אבל אם עלה לראש התאנה--ממלא את חיקו ואוכל שם, שאין אוויר החצר קובע למעשר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 3.9</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג,ט  גפן שהיא נטועה בחצר, נוטל את כל האשכול; וכן ברימון, וכן באבטיח, דברי רבי טרפון.  רבי עקיבה אומר, מגרגר באשכול, ופורט ברימון, וסופת באבטיח.  כוסבר שהיא זרועה בחצר--מקרטם עלה עלה, ואוכל; <strong>ואם צירף,</strong> חייב.  הסיאה והאיזוב והקורנית שבחצר--אם היו נשמרין, חייבין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishna treats the case of the owner in his courtyard. The  permitted  informal eating is only when there is no harvesting. This case is  similar to the case in Mishna 2.6 (Rash, Melechet Shelomo, TYT). There, the buyer is a rabbinic equivalent of the owner in his courtyard. Therefore we only miss harvesting to prohibit informal eating. This is true for Rabbi Akiva only. For Rabbi Tarfon, the Yerushalmi gives a pair of interpretations.</p>\n\n<p>Mishne Tora</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד,יז  [יח] כוסבר שהיא זרועה בחצר, מקרסם עלה עלה ואוכל; ואם צירף, חייב לעשר.  וכן כל כיוצא בזה. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 3.10</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג,י  תאנה שהיא עומדת בחצר, ונוטה לגינה--אוכל כדרכו, ופטור.  עומדת בגינה, ונוטה לחצר--אוכל אחת אחת, ופטור; ואם צירף, חייב.  עומדת בארץ ונוטה לחוצה לארץ, או עומדת בחוצה לארץ ונוטה לארץ--הכול הולך אחר העיקר; ובבתי ערי חומה, הכול הולך אחר העיקר.  ובערי מקלט, הכול הולך אחר הנוף; ובירושלים, הכול הולך אחר הנוף. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The owner, when he wants to take all the harvesting at home, and he still didn't leave the garden, can accumulate a quantity of fruits and eat them. Because there is no gemar melacha, regarding the owner who looks for a broader quantity of fruits, there is no problem to eat a great quantity. See the drasha in Gemara BM 87b.<br>\nכנפשך כנפש של בעל הבית כך נפשו של פועל מה נפשך אוכל ופטור אף נפשו של פועל אוכל ופטור </p>\n\n<p>The owner and the worker who can eat from the Tora eat normally without problem of maasrot. For the buyer there is an asmachta teaching that rabbinically he cannot.</p>\n\n<p>Mishna 4.3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד,ג  הנוטל זיתים מן המעטן--טובל אחד אחד במלח, ואוכל; ואם מלח ונתן לפניו, חייב.  רבי אליעזר אומר, מן המעטן הטהור, חייב; ומן הטמא, פטור, מפני שהוא מחזיר את המותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For salt you need to accumulate two salted olives, the Rash quotes the Yerushalmi that we need both, to accumulate 2 fruits, that is harvesting and salting. </p>\n\n<p>Rambam</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המולח פירות בשדה נקבעו. טבל הזיתים אחד אחד במלח ואכל פטור. הפוצע זיתים כדי שיצא השרף מהם פטור. הנוטל זיתים מן המעטן טובל אחד אחד במלח ואוכל ואם מלח ונתן לפניו חייב וכן כל כיוצא בזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna 4.5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד,ה  המקלף בשעורים--מקלף אחת אחת, ואוכל; ואם קילף ונתן לתוך ידו, חייב.  המולל מלילות של חיטים--מנפה מיד ליד, ואוכל; ואם נפה לתוך חיקו, חייב.  כוסבר שזרעה לזרע, ירקה פטור; זרעה לירק, מתעשרת זרע וירק.  רבי אליעזר אומר, השבת מתעשרת זרע וירק וזירין; וחכמים אומרים, אין מתעשר זרע וירק אלא השחלים והגרגיר בלבד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Mishna shows, following the previous Mishnayot of the same chapter, that in some situations, to eat without cooking or salting, but in great quantity, is an achilat keva.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Rambam 3.19 seems to accredite this lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam 3.19</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיצד אכילת עראי:  כגון שהיה מקלף שעורים ואוכל, מקלף אחת אחת; ואם קילף וכנס לתוך ידו, חייב לעשר.  היה מולל מלילות של חיטים, מנפה מיד ליד ואוכל; ואם ניפה בתוך חיקו, חייב.  ואין צריך לומר, אם ניפה בכלי--שאין זה עראי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last words, שאין זה עראי seem to explain that the way of eating indicates if you need to make maaser.</p>\n\n<p>The comment called Mishna Rishona in Mishna 4.4 is very astonished about this Rambam because the Gemara Betsa 13b analyzes our Mishna following the rules of digun (goren) and says that generally in halachot, formal eating needs a great amount of fruits, not only two or three seeds , but more than kabetsa, following the Mishna in succa chapter 2 regarding eating informally out of the succa.</p>\n\n<p>But after reflection on the comment of Tosfot Betsa 13b, analyzed in Tosfot Yom Tov on our Mishna, itself explained by the Shoshanim Ledavid, I understand that there Mishna treats a case in which the eater is for instance in the courtyard, and the accumulation of grain in his hand is a kind of goren (but the Chazon Ish Maasrot siman 4 <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14335&st=&pgnum=326\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paragraph 16</a> says that it is in the field, but since he doesn't want to take this amount of fruits at home, there is already a prohibition of informal eating). So, there is no notion of achilat keva by the way of the quantity of eating. (See below a quotation of Tosfot Yom Tov and Shoshanim Ledavid with  a bit of explanation I added in square brackets)</p>\n\n<p>Mishna 5.1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לקח במחובר לקרקע, פטור; לקח לשלוח לחברו, פטור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The buyer has this stringency only if he bought the fruits after their separation from the tree.</p>\n\n<p>So, now we understand the Rambam 3.3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אם הייתה כוונתו להוליכן לבית--הרי זה מותר לאכול מהן עראי אחר שנגמרה מלאכתן, עד שייקבעו למעשר.  [ג] ואחד משישה דברים קובע למעשרות, ואלו הן--הבית, והמקח, והאש, והמלח, והתרומה, והשבת; וכולן, אין קובעין אלא בדבר שנגמרה מלאכתו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Discussion:</em></p>\n\n<p>The duty occurs after gmar melacha, which can be accumulation of two fruits, followed by house, selling, fire, salt, teruma, Shabbat. The concept of two fruits is not one of the six, it is the prerequisite. The 5 items of the lists out of home are rabbinic equivalents of home. They say, the fruits are ready without coming to home.</p>\n\n<p>And as says the Rambam in the first statement, this is part of Halacha 3.2 in standard editions, if there is a gmar melacha without one of the six steps enumerated, the owner can eat as many as he wants together.  Formal eating is a formal decision that the fruits will not go home, they definitely don't go home. If the eating is not formal enough, we still see them as if they wait to go home (מחזיר את המותר see Betsa 34b). So, the Rambam is not contradictory, the list of 6 causes of duty is exhaustive and the kushia of the Mishna Rishona is solved because the formality of the eating regards the question if there is a goren that will not go home, not the quantity of eating. After the occurrence of Achilat keve, you cannot eat even one fruit because this is Achilat Keva, as eating one fruit at home.  </p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish zerayim, hilchot Maasrot, siman 4, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14335&st=&pgnum=325\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paragraph 11</a> explains that the Mishna 4.5 is in the field and that there is a concept of formal eating, he called \"מכאן אני אוכל\"  (paraphrasing the last mishna in the fourth chapter of Betsa, and the fruits are still not destined to go home) independent from gemar melacha (the main harvesting). He discusses the case of salting without Gmar Melacha. Indeed, the Gemara Betsa 35a counts only Teruma, Shabbat, Chatser and Mekach for duties that needs the prerequisite Gmar Melacha. Salting and Cooking are not included. But it's clear that according to most rishonim (following how they understand Rashi Betsa 13b) there is such a notion of formal eating without gmar Melacha. See also Betsa 35 and Rashi there. But practically, there is no case in which you cannot see the formal eating without an equivalent of goren, moreover, a goren that entails chyuv without home because the eating will be out of the house. Rambam needs Gmar Melacha for salt, apparently against the Chazon Ish understanding of the Bavli. Therefore, I want to assume that Rambam needs always Gmar melacha, even for formal eating. And he is close to the explanation of TYT in Rashi quoted below (following my pshat in TYT).</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, in conclusion</strong>, the Yerushalmi, quoted in Rambam 3.3, doesn't need to include formal eating in the enumeration, because it is an equivalent of selling or salting for fruits they are not ready to eat without salt.

He holds that both agree that either formal eating without digun, or digun without formal eating entails the duty. I personally am not convinced by this pshat in TYT.

    "content": "# How many Jews were in Egypt before the Exodus?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.111a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 111a</a>, we read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is taught in a baraita with regard to the few that are destined to be redeemed: Rav Simai says that it is stated: “And I will take you to Me as a people” (Exodus 6:7), and juxtaposed to that verse it is stated: “And I will bring you into the land” (Exodus 6:8). The Torah compares their exodus from Egypt to their entry into the land; just as during their entry into the land only two of six hundred thousand entered the land, as they all died in the wilderness except for Caleb and Joshua, so too, during their exodus from Egypt, in terms of the ratio, only two of six hundred thousand left Egypt and the rest died there. Rava says: And likewise, that will be situation in the messianic era, as it is stated: “And she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt” (Hosea 2:17). The ultimate redemption and the exodus from Egypt are juxtaposed, indicating that in the messianic era too, only few will survive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, only two out of the 600,000 adult Jewish men entered the promised land (Joshua and Caleb).  That's believable, after 40 years in the desert.  But then we read that only 2 in 600,000 Jews left Egypt in the first place.  This puts the number of Jews in Egypt at 600,000 x 300,000 = 180 billion.  And that's just the adult males.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I do not believe Rav Simai (supported by Rava) believed there were that many Jews.  But I do believe that every statement in the Talmud is meant to teach us something.  So what is the teaching here?  (Other than the depressing thought that only 1 in 300,000 of us can expect to be redeemed in the future.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

I was thinking that there’s a tremendous lesson if you take R’ Hayyim Bachrach’s approach (which I’m wondering if you could squeeze into Rashi). His understanding was that the 180 billion is referring to all the offspring that would have been descended from those who died during makkat choshech. The lesson I was thinking was to keep in mind that the decisions you make (in this case to stay in mitzrayim instead of following Hashem) affect millions and millions of (as of now unborn) people and in a certain sense every single one of us is a “leader” of a nation. That perspective on life can help one conquer his yetzer hara.

See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9960#v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Matos 32:2</a> which has them asking Moshe and Elazar Hacohen (after the death of Aharon in the fortieth year).

Note that in the census of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9929\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 1:1</a> the Leviim were already not counted to get land and be in the army.

As a result, there was nothing that the Leviim could have done.

(<em>see Malbim, for example, that they were not supposed to touch their enemies at all.</em>)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If the purpose was to probe the quality of the land</strong>, that would contradict G-d (and Moses') promise that the land is good. So that way could also be interpreted as mistrust.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How do the interpreters solve those contradictions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that the initial request was (as I say in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105062/did-g-d-command-or-not-on-sending-the-spies\">Did G-d command or not on sending the spies?</a>) presented in order to follow the idea that the Bnai Yisrael would have to start living a <em>normal</em> life. This is based on the way Rav Hirsch explains לחפור את הארץ.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also points out that they were to then to see which parts were most appropriate for each tribe to settle based on the various characteristics of the tribes and put the military aspect in the background.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By the order: ויתרו את הארץ the mission received a somewhat different\n  and extended task. It was no longer just to spy out the most suitable\n  way to conquer the land. That purpose was to be in the background, and\n  the task set was to learn to know the land itself as a base for national\n  development and the significant indication was given to consider it\n  from two points of view, as ארץ כנען אשר אני נתן לבני ישראל it is at\n  the present ארץ כנען, the land of a most degenerate nation, and it is\n  the land was given by Hashem to the Children of Israel for them to develop\n  in it a national life according to His revealed Will, the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The butterfly effect in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The \"butterfly effect\" is when very small changes produce very large effects.  In Judaism, the Talmud [Gittin 55b-56a; also Lamentations Rabbah 4:3] gives us an example: \"The destruction of Jerusalem came through a Kamtza and a Bar Kamtza in this way.\"  A small backwater incident resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead Jews, large-scale destruction and the loss of the Second Temple.</p>\n\n<p>What other examples of the butterfly effect do we know, in Judaism, according to the Sources?</p>\n\n<p>I am not talking about answered prayers or Hashem saying \"Let there be light\".  Rather, I am talking about something like: if Joseph had agreed to become the secret lover of Potiphar's wife, he would not have gone to jail, would not have attracted Pharaoh's attention, would not have become viceroy, would not have brought his family to Egypt, and we would not have been enslaved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added Note</strong>:  You guys are right.  You can always say things like \"If Lot had not slept with his daughter, we would not have had King David or the future Messiah.\"  We can speculate like so in our own lives.  I don't know how to phrase what I mean, except that I am talking about something VERY slight and subtle (like a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil causing a tornado in Texas.)</p>\n\n<p>Let me ask at least this:  Does it say anywhere else, in the Sources, <em>in very clear language, not implied</em>, \"If this little thing hadn't happened, this other big thing wouldn't have either\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are midrashim (I learned this through a series by Rabbi David Fohrman) which suggest that Sarah's harsh treatment of Hagar (though Hagar fully deserved it) led to the Jewish people being enslaved in Egypt. </p>\n\n<p>On a more pshat level, you could also look at Yosef bragging about his dreams as leading to the Jewish people being enslaved in Egypt, the 10 plagues, and the parting of Yam Suf.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If Esav hadn't gone out and vigorously worshipped idols, murderded a man, and commited adultery on the day of his grandfather Abraham's funeral, then he wouldn't have  been famished enough to sell his birthright for a bowl of red lentils and would have gone on to marry Leah and father half of the Tribes of Israel (if that is even the correct term!)</p>\n\n\n",

Is there any opinion at all that acknowledges the discomfort of wearing this clothing?</li>\n<li>Are there any strategies (besides staying indoors) that Hassidim have for staying comfortable in the heat?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>**This question is not meant to judge or mock anyone, but an honest question about religious garb. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I live in West Texas, where in the summertime the temperatures can reach well over 100 degrees, oftentimes all the way up to 110 degrees. I admit I don't dress up too much, definitely not as much as some frum Jews out there, but I do not hesitate to wear my hat and jacket in the heat of summertime. </p>\n\n<p>My daily clothing consists of long black pants, a cotton undershirt, a wool tallis katan, and a white button-down shirt. On top of that, I often wear a hat and a jacket. </p>\n\n<p>Some people ask me if I get hot, and I tell them once upon a time I did. But my body became acclimated. In fact, I'd venture to say that since my skin is not in direct sunlight I end up feeling less hot. </p>\n\n<p>If you take someone from New England and plop them in Texas they would complain about the heat, no matter what clothing they'd be wearing. In the same manner, someone would complain about the heat if they were used to wearing shorts and t-shirts all the time and you put them in the Chasidic uniform. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, you get used to the heat, stay out of the sun during the heat of the day (which is a good thing no matter what you're wearing), and stay hydrated. And sweating is healthy. Your body does it for a reason. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are different versions of the coats - for example, in the summer Hassidim will generally wear a frock coat made of a light weight, drip-dry polyester, without a shape-holding canvas lining.  </p>\n\n<p>That said, Hassidim wear clothing that are not natural for wear in summer heat and the strategy is generally to try to stay indoors or in the shade as much as possible and to drink lots of water always staying hydrated.  </p>\n\n<p>It's also mental though - because Hassidim typically dress like this their whole life, they don’t really feel hot more than compared to anyone else because they've developed a resistance to what you may feel if you wore their clothing (by being used to it) the same way that Arabs wear layers of clothing in the desert to keep from burning their skin. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not aware of any spiritual literature on this but generally Hasidic Jews always have their mind on something related to Torah etc. So I think it is rare that they are thinking too much about the heat which is a strong mental strategy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can't argue with Mordechai's answer. </p>\n\n<p>I can say that when I taught a computer class to a mainly Hassidic group, I did ask two of my students how they manage with those clothes in the summer. They offered a simple answer - \"Hashem did not provide mitzvoth just because they are easy to perform.\" </p>\n\n<p>Now, how can I argue with that comment? It's not saying that they're not hot and sweaty sometimes. They are. But, they live with the circumstances because this is how they feel they need to dress, look, and perform. I will say that I kept some bottles of water in the class just in case they or someone else dehydrates. </p>\n\n<p>I can't fathom how hot the shtreiml must be on Shabbat, though!</p>\n\n\n",

Is that indeed the case here, and should I stop using electric shavers? </p>\n\n<p>Also in all of the pictures of my male ancestors, they had beards (they trimmed them, but never removed them), and I was taught that you have to follow your minhag, because minhag (מנהג) backwards is גהנם (Gehinom), and you get the picture.. So even if they were allowed, would my minhag would prevent me from shaving with electric? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The pamphlet makes a great case but it overstates it a bit. Yabia Omer 9:10 speaks for itself. Initially Rav Ovadia believed it was asur but seeing that the minhag of tremendous segments of klal yisrael including the most religious (see there for examples such as the Or Letzion and students in Radin) he was compelled to write his teshuva. He is adamantly upset with a sefer he saw that blasted those who were lenient because it isn't fair to ignore such a strong minhag. There are some factors to be lenient. \n1) The biggest is that of the perisha, ketav vhakabbalah, and Rav Moshe who say that any scissor action is permitted irrelevant of the result. Rav Ovadia disagrees based on a tosfot nazir and therefore if there's no stumble it is asur. Yet, it is still a possible approach. \n2) Finally Rav Ovadia is satisfied with the Har Tzvi who allows shavers based on pesik reisha. </p>\n\n<p>The conclusion of Yabia Omer is that in cases of need such as for parnasa or kibbud av vem one has what to rely on to be lenient. The same can be found in Yalkut Yosef Kitzur S\"A YD 181. If Rav Ovadia actually retracted he would have written about it in a teshuva and R' Yitzchak Yosef would amend Yalkut Yosef. The statements to the contrary in a motzei shabbat shiur by Rav Ovadia prove only that it is a serious issue and everyone who is ready to be strict should be encouraged to be strict. The other quotes in the pamphlet can be explained similarly.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of application one point is in order. In Israel (which Rav Ovadia was addressing) having a beard in the workplace isn't strange and there's not the same pressure that exists in America. In America, if you're a doctor, lawyer, etc in offices with non-Jews there is a tremendous pressure to shave to look neat.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of minhag, I don't think that the pictures create any binding minhag for you. First they might not have minded having a beard. They might have thought it was better to avoid but not that it was actually asur. Even if it was their minhag it isn't clear that the minhag of a father is binding on a child (see Pitchei Teshuva YD 214 as to whether the minhag of a family is binding or only minhag of a community). </p>\n\n<p>Certainly it is worthwhile to be strict but it is a great personal question and the best thing to do is to ask your Rav. </p>\n\n\n",

that is, he took his status as בן יצהר, which motivated him to rebel. (This motivation is mentioned in the Tanchuma, and also pointed out by the Abarbanel, but neither of them seem to explicitly connect it to the question of what Korach took.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה אמרו רבותינו ז\"ל שאמר קרח, אחי אבא ארבעה היו, עמרם ויצהר כו. בני עמרם נטלו שררה, אחד מלוכה ואחד כהונה גדולה. השררה השלישית למי היה, לא לבני יצהר שהוא שני לעמרם. ולמה מינה את אלצפן בן עוזיאל הקטון לנשיא הקהתי. ובזה מצה מקום לערער גם על הכהונה. ואפשר על פי דרך זה, כי זה יאמר ויקח קרח <strong>מה לקח הלא הוא היותו בן יצהר,</strong> כי על כן אליו נוגע הדבר כמדובר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar does something similar to this, saying he took his claim against Moshe, namely his status as בן יצהר; he also mentions the vestigial vav idea, and that midrash about the טלית of תכלת.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi gives two interpretations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>(Following Onkelos) Korach separated himself from the community, he “took” himself to one side.</p></li>\n<li><p>Korach persuaded the leaders to join his movement, he “took” them in to his group.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>RaSHbaM who commented on a very pshat level said on this pasuk that Korach took Datan and Aviram and the rest of the \"rebels\" until they were 250 people in front of Moshe.

Are the people who dwell in it strong or weak, few or many? Is the country in which they dwell good or bad? Are the towns they live in open or fortified?  Is the soil rich or poor? Is it wooded or not? ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's break this passage into the two objectives - the Land and the People:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Land: וּרְאִיתֶם אֶת־הָאָרֶץ מַה־הִוא<br />\nPeople: וְאֶת־הָעָם הַיֹּשֵׁב עָלֶיהָ הֶחָזָק הוּא הֲרָפֶה הַמְעַט הוּא אִם־רָב׃<br />\nLand: וּמָה הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר־הוּא יֹשֵׁב בָּהּ הֲטוֹבָה הִוא אִם־רָעָה<br />\nPeople: וּמָה הֶעָרִים אֲשֶׁר־הוּא יוֹשֵׁב בָּהֵנָּה הַבְּמַחֲנִים אִם בְּמִבְצָרִים׃<br />\nLand: ...וּמָה הָאָרֶץ הַשְּׁמֵנָה הִוא אִם־רָזָה הֲיֵשׁ־בָּהּ עֵץ אִם־אַיִן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we see it goes back and forth alternatively, instead of listing all the question about the Land together and about the people together. Possible problems with this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People don't talk this way (esp. Moses, are there other examples of such a pattern?)</li>\n<li>Torah uses extra words ומה הארץ</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n\n\n",

That the אנשי בית אב can't drink wine by day or by night is because they're on duty that day; that the אנשי משמר ואנשי מעמד can't cut their hair or launder their clothes is so that they don't enter into their week of duty looking unkempt.

Shaul Dowid Sitthon wrote, describing the 1927 ban. To be clear it is not the language of the ban itself. Parts of this letter appear to often be circulated (especially online) as if it actually is from the ban, whereas it is not in fact therefrom.</p>\n<p>Here is the text of the letter as transmitted in Devar Shaul, pp. 24-25:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר המחבר עוד יש טעם אחר לאסור בנד”ד אף אם היה עשוי עפ\"י הדין כמ\"ש נהר\nמצרים ועצי הלבנון וגאון א' הובא בעתון נקרא \"הבאר\" מפני כי העיר הזאת\nחפשית עד מאד ואיש הישר בעיניו יעשה ואין להם רב שיראו ממנו לא מצד\nהממשלה ולא מצד שהוא ממונה לרב מהק\"ק יצ\"ו וא\"כ כל איש אשר חשקה נפשו בבת\nנכריה מביאה לביתו ותהי לו לאשה בלי גרות או מביא הדיוטות מן השוק\nומגיירה בפניהם כאשר מצוי כן עתה ויש להם בנים והם פסולין ואומרים\nשיגיירו אותם ואם ישאל אותם אדם בפני מה נתגיירתם ישיבו בחציפות מי שמך\nוכו' ולמה לך להיות עובר ומתעבר ונשאר עם נכריה ומוליד ממנה בנים וולד\nאשה כמוה ונתערבה בנברים ושלחתי פסק”ד שעשיתי ופסק\"ד של הגר”א הלוי הנז'\nלמעלת הרה\"ג כמהר\"ר יוסף ידיד הלוי הי\"ו ראב\"ד לעדת החלבים בני אריץ אשר\nבעיה\"ק ירשות\"ו והסכים כדברינו וכתב פסק\"ד ארוך ולא הניח זוית ופנה ולא\nהדפסתיו משום הוצאות הדפוס ואז פזרתי מודעות שאין לקבל גרים בארגנתינא\nעוד כל ימי עולם מכמה טעמים כאשר הסכמנו שלשתנו ואין לפרוץ גדר וכל הפורץ\nגדר ישכנו נחש, ושומע לנו ישכון בטח ושאנן מפחד רעה ומו שרוצה להתגייר\nיטע לירושת\"ו אולי יקבלוהו וציי\"מ וימ\"ן אמן, כ\"ד רועה צאן קדשים בעי\"ת\nבואינוס אייריס.-  הצעיר שאול דוד סתהון ס\"ט</p>\n<p>The author states: There is additional reason to forbid in this matter\neven where it has been done according to the law as is written in\nNahar Misrayim, Asse Lebanon, and as one Gaon wrote in the circular\n“HaBe’er”, because this city is very libertine and each person does\nwhat is right in his own eyes and they have no master that they are in\nawe of, not due to his authority nor due to his appointment as the Rav\nof the Holy Community, and since this is so that any man that lusts\nafter gentile women, takes her into his home as a wife without having\nperformed a conversion, or has a conversion performed by unlearned\nlaypeople in the marketplace such as are found now and they have sons\nthereby that are pasul and claim that they have converted them, and if\nyou ask one of these people before whom they converted they retort\nwith they answer indolently “what’s your name?” etc.  For what should\nthey go over and live with gentile women, and conceive and have sons\nwith them, and become mixed up with the gentiles? So I issued a pesaq\ndin that I made, and a pesaq din of HaGaon R. Ahahron Ha-Lewi\n[Goldman] mentioned above, and Morenu HaRav, Rav Yosef Yedid ha-Lewi,\nRosh Ab Beth Din of the Allepan community in Jerusalem, who agreed to\nour words and wrote a lengthy pesaq din that considered every angle\nthough I did not print them here due to the costs of printing, so I\ndistributed announcements that converts should not be accepted in\nArgentina 'all the days of the world' (כל ימי עולם) for many reasons\nas we agreed and one should not breach a safeguard and anyone who does\ndeserves to be bitten by a snake and those who hear us will dwell\nsecurely and not fear evil and one who wishes to convert should go to\nJerusalem where perhaps they will receive him. May the Rock of Israel\nsave us from error, and may we see from His Torah wonders, Amen.\nShepherd of holy lambs of the City of Buenos Aires – the youth Shaul\nDowid Sitthon, Sepharadi Tahor</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we know (H. Sanhedrin 24:4:), a safeguarding measure may be established by a court according to the needs of the time, though may not establish it in perpetuity. They are to stand as long as the conditions persist and the court deems it necessary. Accordingly, I would say that it is unlikely that the language of כל ימי עולם was actually used in the original ban and that when R. Sitthon describes the ban in his letter he is using hyperbole, that it is figurative language added for strong emphasis and the gravity with which the matter was considered. In light of where we know this text to have come from and the operative halakhah, it would be difficult to maintain that this was ever intended as an actual expiration date or that such language was actually employed in the ban itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the practical value of such a ban, if candidates can get converted outside the country?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would ask on the flipside of this, of what value would any enactment be outside of its own jurisdiction? A court cannot enforce something outside of its purview and geography, on both practical and halakhic grounds. I believe the assumption in this particular case especially, is that setting up this impediment will prevent the vast majority of transgressors of this type from sinning. It seems that this was being done as a function of תיאבון (appetite) and where that appetite was curbed by this measure, it was sufficient to produce the communal effect desired. It also opened an avenue for those sincere in their desire to convert by sending them to Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>From the comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How did that rabbi manage to make his edict stick and extend to all\nconversions in Argentina, under any sponsorship?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This ban was issued with the backing of his Ashkenazi colleague R. Aharon Goldman of Qiryath Moshe (Moisés Ville), Argentina. It also had the backing of R. A.Y. Kook (first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine) as well as R. Yosef Yedid (Rosh Ab Beth Din of the Allepan community in Jerusalem). In their letters of support they affirm his authority to do so as a סייג or גדר (presumably with all that such halakhic terms entail) to protect against the Torah's violation.</p>\n\n\n",

Almost 10 years ago I was sitting at a Chabad lunch when one of the custodians of the Albert Einstein Archive at Hebrew University gave a speech. Someone asked him if it was true Einstein died religious by saying shema' (another tale of his religiosity). He said that Einstein never said or did anything in [old age] that we [faithful Jews] would consider religious.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Yes. The statement is true. Although Albert Einstein was agnostic, he was a Zionist and supported the secular government of Israel. He was a scientist, physicist, and philosopher. So when you hear the famous quote, “science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind,” he was referring to religion as a metaphor for the universe. Not religion in and of itself. We will get to his thoughts on religion in a moment. The same approach can be applied to another quote, “G-d does not play dice with the universe.”</p>\n\n<p>In his “G-d letter”, he relates the following thoughts, “The word G-d is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can change this for me. For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstition.“</p>\n\n<p>...I don’t think he had any motivation to study Talmud for religious reasons. However, he did write later to Talmudic scholar, Prof. Chaim Tchernowitz that the Talmud must be preserved and not forgotten amongst the Jewish community nor the scientific community. And he wished to make the Talmud more assessable for the masses in order to avoid attacks against the Talmud and anti-Semitism.</p>\n\n<p>Another source is from the Michael Enright’s program, The Sunday Edition. There, a scholarly interview claimed that on Einstein’s deathbed he was asked, “if you could do it all over, what would you do differently?” Supposedly the greatest scientist ever to live answered “I would study more Talmud.” </p>\n\n<p>See link here: <a href=\"https://relaxandsucceed.com/2013/12/27/most-popular-blog-of-the-year-countdown-3/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://relaxandsucceed.com/2013/12/27/most-popular-blog-of-the-year-countdown-3/</a></p>\n\n\n",

In other words, how would one know, that he experiences God and not (extraterrestrial) AI (aka <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Turing_test</a>)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This sounds like something only Elon Musk would be concerned. In Judaism, we are obligated to rely on our senses, not magic or false prophets. It is with the help of our faculty and abilities that we should determine that the voice in question (in any given conversation) is simply an act of AI, and not a divine agency. This is because the brain perceives information which is transferred to the eyes and shifted into vision, in relation to light and a physical object. That is to say, information entering the brain is interpreted as color, texture, size, etc. We are, in essence, a mechanical machine. Consider an advanced computer system with all its wires which would employ a binary code, which is measurable in fixed numerical quantities, operating in a range of complex system. This is how the human body was designed. So in the near future, it is possible that virtual reality could mingle both realities to the point of incomprehensibility. Our reliability to reality would be variable, liable to change to any pattern of events as in the movie matrix. Which begs the question. How can we be sure that we are not deceived or fooled into believing anything?</p>\n\n<p>In his Guide, the Rambam gives a clear answer to this rule. Since G-d does not involve Himself in human affairs, that is, G-d established the laws of nature at the beginning and does not need a step into history, it follows that G-d never spoke to anyone. And since the angels are a force of nature, not divine (agentic creatures with wings and blond hair), but the will of a deity, we can be sure that the voice stemming is a computer-generated replica of the human vocal cords. Rest assured, in this pretext, the voice does not come from G-d, because G-d does not have a mouth to speak to prophets or to man. Refer to Maimonides' view on prophecy. </p>\n\n\n",

When he comes to give his testimony, he gives a very embellished story of climbing up to Maale Adumim and seeing the moon and throws in \"hey, by the way, check out these 200 zuz someone gave me.\" Clearly, he's trying to convey to the beis din that someone tried to bribe him and the continuation of the gemara makes it clear that the beis din understands his message. But what message was he conveying with his story of seeing the moon? Why couldn't he have simply said that the Baytusim tried to bribe him and really the moon had not been visible?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Mordechai Edelman <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34060&st=&pgnum=53&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thought</a> this was a parable intended to warn the sages, albeit quite complicated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He suggested that \"Ma'ale Adumim\" refers to a region in Judea that was known to be populated by irreputable people - bandits and murderers and anarchist rebels and the sort. By mentioning this region, the witness hinted to the sages that he had met with irreputable people (the Boethusians).</li>\n<li>Stating that he (the witness) saw \"him\" (rather than the moon, which, through the word Levanah (לבנה), is feminine and should be \"her\") \"crouching over two hills\" refers to the fact that he himself received as payment <em>two</em> selaim (denarii, the equivalent of 200 zuz). \"Selaim\" has a double meaning: first, the equivalent of the money he received, and second, referring to the rocky terrain of the Ma'ale Adumim region.</li>\n<li>\"His head resembles a calf\" = the Boethusians intended to mislead the other Jews and to cause them to practice idolatry, much like the sin of the Golden Calf.</li>\n<li>\"His ears resemble a kid\" = a form of a request to the ears of the prince of success (שר ההצלחה as Edelman called it), another form of idolatry (like saying <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.67b.1?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גד גדי וסנוק לה</a>).</li>\n<li>\"His horns resemble a deer\" = meaning, they want to resemble the nations of the world whose horns are intended for beauty only.</li>\n<li>\"And his tail rests between its thighs\" = like a dog, i.e., he compared the Boethusians to dogs to ridicule them.</li>\n<li>And when the sages reacted with wonder at his words, he added the clincher: \"And if you don't believe me, behold, there are 200 zuz wrapped up in my clothes!\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are two well-known drashos on this piece of gemara, one by R' Yitzchak Arama in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.67.2.8?vhe=Akeidat_Yitzchak,_Pressburg_1849&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akkeidas Yitzchak 67:2</a>, and another by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Agadot_on_Rosh_Hashanah.22b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha in Chidushei Agados on Rosh Hashanah 22b</a>. However, it sounds from the question that the OP is asking for the plain meaning of the aggadeta. I will try to do it according to my understanding (please see below some anecdotes on how it came about). I suppose, that either R' Yitzchak Arama or Maharsha could give a sharper answer, however they knew full well that their works were subject of the government censorship review. Therefore they did not want to educate censors in rabbinic \"hermeneutics\", because private letters between rabbis carried and still carry many examples of such language. If you may have disagreements, let's discuss and learn together before downrating, for it is not a simple case to decipher.</p>\n<p>The issue here is that the kosher witness is seeking to give a testimony, which could be understood by a פֵּרוּשִׁי rabbi, but not a צַדוּקִי or בַיְּתּוֹסִי, or anyone else. It is worth to go through the testimony line by line. So,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עולה הייתי במעלה אדומים</p>\n<p>I was going up to Maale Adumim</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we know from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.15.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 15:7</a>, Ma'aleh Adumim was a town close to the eastern border between Yehudah and Moav, just south across a brook from the town of Gilgal. I.e. likely the witness suggests that he was close to engage with people who do not subscribe to the rabbinic view of Judaism. Also likely, one could read אדוּמים as אדוֹמים, as Baitusim represented the rich elites surrounding the Herodians who were אדוֹמים by birth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וראיתיו שהוא רבוץ בין ב' סלעים</p>\n<p>and I saw that it was crouching between two rocks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is likely a reference to the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.104.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 104:18</a> from a Psalm recited on Rosh Chodesh according to our tradition (hence the choice from other possibilities):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָרִ֣ים הַ֭גְּבֹהִים לַיְּעֵלִ֑ים סְ֝לָעִ֗ים מַחְסֶ֥ה לַֽשְׁפַנִּֽים׃</p>\n<p>The high mountains are for wild goats; the crags are a refuge for rock-badgers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhapos, the kosher witness suggests, that the normal observation of the moon is usually seen above high mountains, so that the testimony regarding it with two kosher witnesses is likened to יַּעֵל, which has two signs of kashrus (split hooves and chews cud). The testimony being investigated, however, is going to be likened to a שַׁפַן, which has only one sign of kashrus (chews cud). I.e. in the testimony there is only one kosher witness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראשו דומה לעגל</p>\n<p>Its head looked like a calf</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likely, this is a reference to the Oral Torah - Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.6?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 2:6</a>, unknown to a בַיְּתּוֹסִי, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֵּיצַד רָאִיתָ אֶת הַלְּבָנָה, לִפְנֵי הַחַמָּה אוֹ לְאַחַר הַחַמָּה, לִצְפוֹנָהּ אוֹ לִדְרוֹמָהּ, כַּמָּה הָיָה גָבוֹהַּ וּלְאַיִן הָיָה נוֹטֶה, וְכַמָּה הָיָה רָחָב. אִם אָמַר לִפְנֵי הַחַמָּה, לֹא אָמַר כְּלוּם.</p>\n<p>They say to him: Say how you saw the moon. Was it in front of the sun or behind the sun? To its north or to its south? How high was the moon over the horizon, and in which direction did it tilt? And how wide was it? If, for example, he said that he saw the moon in front of the sun, he has not said anything of substance, as this is impossible and therefore he is either mistaken or lying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the moon must always be behind the sun, which is signified pictorially as ☽☼ (head of an שור with full horns). It has many connections to blessings of Yosef and to Yehoshua stopping sun and moon, etc. Anyways, the kosher witness likely intends to say that in order to be accepted, the moon pictorially must look like the head of a שור. In his case, the moon is like the head of an עגל, whose horns did not come out yet. I.e. it is too early to  testify, the moon needs to \"grow its horns\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אזניו דומין לגדי</p>\n<p>its ears were like a goat</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As it is well-known goats <a href=\"https://petscityhub.com/goat-sounds-and-body-language/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">use ears in communication</a>. <em>\"Perked-up ears suggest alertness and curiosity, like a human raising their eyebrows in interest. While flattened ears signal fear, submission, or aggression, much like a person cowering or furrowing their brow.\"</em> Likely, the kosher witness asks the judge investigating his testimony to show interest by trying to use unusual language.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קרניו דומות לצבי</p>\n<p>its horns were like a deer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is not it unusual, that previously the kosher witness indicated that the moon was like a head of an עגל without horns, and now it grew horns like a צבי? The point here is a likely second reference to Oral Torah - Mishnah Kesubos 13:2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי, יָפֶה אָמַר חָנָן, הִנִּיחַ מְעוֹתָיו עַל <strong>קֶרֶן הַצְּבִי</strong>:</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Ḥanan spoke well in this case, as this man is like one who placed his money on the <strong>horn of a deer</strong> in midflight, i.e., he has no reasonable expectation of reimbursement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The colloquial expression קֶרֶן הַצְּבִי is used by Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai who lived though the times of arguments with the Baitusim. Literally, it means <em>to abandon</em>, placing money on קֶרֶן הַצְּבִי is equivalent to making it ownerless. Just like a צבי is light to run and hard to catch, and annually loses its horns,  so is the money placed on its horn.</p>\n<p>This suggests that the kosher witness is likely now asking that the judge abandon the whole testimony regarding the moon including the other witness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזנבו מונחת לו בין ירכותיו</p>\n<p>and its tail was resting between its thighs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word ירכותיו hints to the fact that the judge by now heard two different testimonies about the moon, or \"two moons\" (ירכותיו = שני ירחים), and he must choose between the two. It can also be a reference to the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.7.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ishayahu 7:4</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֵ֠לָ֠יו הִשָּׁמֵ֨ר וְהַשְׁקֵ֜ט אַל־תִּירָ֗א וּלְבָֽבְךָ֙ אַל־יֵרַ֔ךְ מִשְּׁנֵ֨י זַנְב֧וֹת הָאוּדִ֛ים הָעֲשֵׁנִ֖ים הָאֵ֑לֶּה בׇּחֳרִי־אַ֛ף רְצִ֥ין וַאֲרָ֖ם וּבֶן־רְמַלְיָֽהוּ׃</p>\n<p>And say to him: Be firm and be calm. <strong>Do not be afraid and do not lose heart on account of those two smoking stubs</strong> of firebrands, on account of the raging of Rezin and his Arameans and the son of Remaliah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this verse, we have the opposite: one word ירך and two זנבות. I.e. the kosher witness give the hint as he requests that the judge oppose the whole testimony, \"be firm and calm, and not be afraid and not lose heart\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והצצתי בו ונרתעתי ונפלתי לאחורי</p>\n<p>I looked at it and was startled and <strong>fell backwards</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, it is a reference to the fact, that when Avraham, Moshe and Aharon where facing the Ultimate אמת, i.e. prophecy from Hashem they fell on their faces. Here, the witness suggests that he was facing the utter שקר, hence he fell on his back.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם אין אתם מאמינים לי הרי מאתים זוז צרורין לי בסדיני</p>\n<p>And if you don't believe me, behold, there are 200 zuz wrapped up in my clothes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likely, at the end, when the kosher witness saw that the judge of the Sanhedrin fully understood his words, he opens up about the origin of his testimony as the gemara follows afterwards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here I will relate two anectdotes of how I came up with this comment.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In my shul we had a Holocoast survivor from Romania, who studied in yeshiivah there before WW2. He is <em>niftar</em> now. I used to speak with him on many occasions, and he shared with me some of his yeashivah lessons from his rebbe, who was a great <em>baal dikduk</em>. In several of his stories I was told about rabbinic communication in the past, where a quote of a verse also meant a <em>peirush</em> or <em>targum</em>, especially when it had to do with making <em>pasul</em> certain products while the letter had to be sent with the merchant selling the product.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Over 20 years ago I visited a rav sitting shivah. He is related to a family of Chazon Ish. He told me how in 1980s he visited western Belarus and Lithuania out of desire to visit the graves of his grandparents and other relatives. There are no Jews living there anymore. However because there are many Russian military units stationed in the area, he had to be very careful regarding communication with local officials. As if each word carried a peirush. It reminded him a tradition in his family, where older people used to make such comments which were loaded with peirushim. Perhaps, it was a practice developed under censorship in the Russian Empire, where one had to be careful with words.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

This could be applied to gunpowder and is applied to animal sacrifices, in which he felt that G-d did not want nor need but that people felt that this was the best way of worship. See Ben Shapiro regarding this. Now to the long answer.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Torah commands to conquer Canaan, Moshe Rabbeinu sought peace, which was the true goal of the Torah. The Torah teaches to treat non-Jews fairly, as we ourselves were once slaves in a foreign land. More than forty times Israel is commanded to love its neighbors. See (Leviticus 25:35). Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai gave blessings of peace even to pagans. See (Berakhot 17a). And Rabban Gamliel passed out bread to a pagan he never knew simply because he was in need of food. Refer to (Eruvin 64b). We are even encouraged to visit non-Jews and pray when they are ill. (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 151:12) and (Tosefta Gittin 3:13).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, G-d, who is transcendent, would not reveal gunpowder (which will be invented a few thousand years later by the Chinese in the 9th-century). True, the Torah demands the conquest of Canaan, but Moshe saw that Torah's ultimate purpose was peace, and realized that this was placed because Israel needed to hear the call to arms at that time, but when a close examination is applied, we find that Joshua never \"conquered\" or destroyed the inhabitants of the Canaanites against their will but gave three options, a) leave peacefully, b) convert, or c) fight. While some chose to fight out of free will, we cannot call this a genocide as the land was promised to Abraham and his descendants, and Joshua proposed a peaceful solution.

    "content": "# How does Rambam understand Arachin 8a?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Arachin 8a teaches the rules of what happens when a woman has a flow of blood and is unsure if she is in her days of <em>niddah</em> (days 1 - 7) or days of <em>zivah</em> (days 11 - 18).</p>\n\n<p>For simplicity, let’s focus on the case where she has a flow for five consecutive days, and follow Rashi’s interpretation. The ‘worst-case scenario’ is that the first two days belong to the previous <em>zivah</em> cycle (days 17 - 18), and the next three days are part of the subsequent <em>niddah period</em>. In which case, she needs to wait fifteen clean days (days 4 - 18), after which any flow will render her a <em>niddah</em> and not a <em>zavah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>She need not wait any longer than that, because if the flow was for three or more consecutive days during her <em>zivah</em> period, she would automatically re-enter her <em>niddah</em> days after seven clean days, and only after seven clean days.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Rambam in Hilchot Issurei Bi’ah 6:6 has a completely different view of the <em>niddah/zivah</em> cycle. Essentially he holds that they simply repeat in the 7-11-7-11 pattern more or less indefinitely, whether or not she has any flow during the eleven days, and, if she does have a <em>zivah</em> flow, whether or not she succeeds in counting seven clean days. (And see e.g. Beit Yosef Yoreh De’ah 183 who explicitly understands Rambam this way.)</p>\n\n<p>So, how does Rambam understand Arachin 8a? She had a flow for five days. How is waiting fifteen clean days sufficient to get her back on track, and knowing that a subsequent flow certainly renders her a <em>niddah</em>? Maybe those five days are days 14 - 18? Then, according to Rambam, day 19 is actually day 1 of the next <em>niddah</em> cycle, even without seven clean days, so she waits fifteen clean days and has a flow again on day 16, back in the middle of her next <em>zivah</em> period?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The 'חוות דעת סי' קפ\"ג ביאורים ס\"ק ב answers your question on the Rambam. </p>\n\n<p>A very short summary of his answer would be: </p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, Arachin 8a is dealing with trying to determine when a vest can be established.</p>\n\n<p>1 - The Rambam's rule of 7/11 always repeating itself, is only if she does not have a vest. Should she have a vest, niddah days followed by ziva days start from the vest, and not from her previous cycle.</p>\n\n<p>2 - She cannot establish a vest during the ziva days.</p>\n\n<p>3 -  If she doesn't know where in her cycle she is, she will have to wait the amount of days mention in Arachin 8a, to be able to create a vest and a new 7/11 cycle.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question on the Rambam is a very strong one, asked by the Ramban (along with a <em>whole lot</em> of questions) on daf נ\"ד. The Ramban uses pretty harsh language over there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותמהיני עליו אם העביר עיניו בפתחי נדה במס' ערכין -<br />\nI wonder if the\nRambam even <em>paid attention</em> in the sugya of פתחי נדה in Maseches\nArachin (ח•:).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It does seem completely impossible, if the Rambam's cycle doesn't depend on anything at all. You can never tell, no matter how long you wait, whether you are just <em>leaving</em> the ימי נדה or just entering them.</p>\n<p>פרי זהב brought the חות דעת who answers that we are talking about trying to allow her to establish a new וסת קבוע. I am not in a position to argue with him, but that seems very hidden in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.8.16?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's straight quote of the gemara</a>.</p>\n<p>The חות דעת does say (as פרי זהב mentioned) that if she has a וסת קבוע, the 7-11 cycle begins again from the day of the וסת. Although the Ramban obviously didn't understand the Rambam that way, that seems like a good suggestion in the Rambam who repeatedly mentions in פ\"ו that his cycle begins at the וסת. It seems unreasonable that the cycle would only begin there, and completely ignore every וסת afterwards!</p>\n<p>The Maggid Mishnah on our Rambam on the אשה טועה suggests that this is a special rule (הל\"מ!) to help out the poor lady who lost her cycle. He says it is a דוחק, which might be an understatement.</p>\n<p>לולא מסתפיני, I wonder if I could offer my own suggestion to combine these suggestions together.<br />\nEven though we hold that וסתות are דרבנן, many mefarshim (see R' Chaim and the חות דעת himself) point out that the Rambam holds that they are דאורייתא for some purposes - such as the one in פ\"ו where he gives her cycle! The Chazon Ish (הל' נדה פ(ז)) suggests that the reason they are דרנבן is that various outside causes can frequently lead her to vary a few days this way or that.<br />\nI wonder if we could say it slightly differently: Various causes can lead her to <em>sometimes miss completely</em> [the Rambam says several times that her cycle is בין ראתה בין שלא ראתה \"whether she sees or not\"], or can sometimes cause <em>the וסת itself to change</em> [see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Niddah.4.7?lang=bi&with=Rambam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פיה\"מ נדה פ\"ד</a>, which maybe supports this idea (\"...אמנם אחר י\"א הנה אפשר שתקבע לה וסת\n\") - according to the Rambam, the only normal reason for her to see on a day before her וסת קבוע is that she may be in the process of establishing a different וסת.].<br />\nWe would still say that וסתות דרבנן, meaning, if that day passes we aren't sure she saw. But if you say it my way, <em>if she did see</em> we would assume מה\"ת that it was on the day of her (current) וסת.<br />\nUsually we are strict, of course, but for this poor lady (Maggid Mishnah) we go with the basic law of the Torah and assume that her וסת and her cycle starts on that day.</p>\n<p>The amazing thing is that I think the Rambam says this, twice. The first is a woman who just began 6(2) (\"כְּשֶׁתִּרְאֶה הָאִשָּׁה דָּם תְּחִלָּה\n\"). The second is a women who just gave birth, who according to him has no וסתות and no cycle until she begins to see again after the ימי טוהר end 6(6) (אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן הִפְסִיקָה הַלֵּדָה). Also 7(12) (\"הָא לָמַדְתָּ שֶׁכָּל דָּם שֶׁתִּרְאֶה הָאִשָּׁה אַחַר יוֹם מְלֹאת הוּא תְּחִלַּת נִדָּתָהּ וְאֵין מַשְׁגִּיחִין עַל וְסָתוֹת שֶׁמִּקֹּדֶם.\")<br />\nThese two other ladies are basically \"טועות\" as well, ladies who do not even have a cycle yet. In each case he starts her new cycle from the first time she sees and goes from there, going with the עיקר הדין that she is seeing at her וסת, right at the very beginning of her ימי נדה.</p>\n\n\n",

Davening in shul is a mitzvah, <strong>but having a seat simply facilitates the mitzvah by adding to the person’s comfort</strong>; albeit they will be davening with more kavanah, which is considered a mitzvah, <strong>it doesn’t justify spending maaser money for it</strong>.</p>\n<p>Whereas money goes to the shul, they are actually buying a product for themselves – a seat – which has market value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Braun writes how he believes there are instances when maaser money can be used to buy Yomim Noraim seats.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>However, if one owns a seat permanently, or if there are many empty seats in their shul and they are buying a seat in order to support the shul, they can certainly pay for it with maaser money.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and also:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the same vein, if the shul sells more expensive seats and less expensive ones, and one buys the more expensive seat when they could have managed just as well with a less expensive one, then <strong>they may use their maaser money to pay for the difference between the cheaper seat and the one they are buying</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Rav Akiva Dershowitz</strong> of tvunah.org takes a <a href=\"https://en.tvunah.org/2014/09/09/buying-seats-for-yamim-noraim/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">more lenient approach</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Being that the money is going to a shul, which is certainly a valid recipient of maaser and tzedaka, buying a seat for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur would also be permitted</strong>. The <strong>Taz</strong> [YD: 249] permits using maaser money for a wide range of mitzvos, but here where the money is going to a shul, this would certainly qualify for maaser. The only issue would be that maaser can’t be spent on something one has to spend money for anyway, which would be paying one’s debt with maser, in a sense. <strong>However here, since strictly speaking one is not required to purchase a seat in the shul, as he could daven somewhere else or in the shul and stand for davening. Hence, purchasing a seat is not comparable to paying one’s debt and may be done with maaser ksafim.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The anonymous mishnah describes a bed or cot, and that it becomes susceptible after sanding; however, if the owner decided not to sand it, it becomes susceptible without the sanding. See the following extract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כְּלֵי עֵץ, מֵאֵימָתַי מְקַבְּלִין טֻמְאָה. הַמִּטָּה וְהָעֲרִיסָה, מִשֶּׁיְּשׁוּפֵם בְּעוֹר הַדָּג. גָּמַר שֶׁלֹּא לָשׁוּף, טְמֵאָה.</p>\n<p>When do wooden vessels begin to be susceptible to impurity? A bed and a cot, after they are sanded with fishskin. If the owner determined not to sand them over they are susceptible to impurity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much of the rest of chapter 16 further discusses this question for other utensils, but doesn't add the statement where the owner decides not to \"finish\" the utensil as usually would be done.</p>\n<p>Does the same idea apply in all the cases, so that when an owner decides not to put the usual finishing touches on their utensil, it becomes susceptible (regardless of when the mishnah says it's \"finished\")? If not, why are beds and cots different?</p>\n<p>I would guess that it applies in general, but we see repetition of laws in many cases in Keilim where we would expect a single case to suffice. Thus, I'm wary about making unwarranted generalisations here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think we can possibly answer this question by looking at the commentary of the Bartenura there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>משישופם בעור הדג</strong>. להסיר קסמין שבהם, דקודם לכן לא חזו למלאכתן, שמשרטים את הבשר. אבל אם אינן מחוסרין אלא שיפה של צחצוח ומריקה, הא קיימא לן [חולין כ״ה] דגולמי כלי עץ שעתיד לשבץ ולשוף טמאין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that sanding is considered the completion of the work because that's how the worker removes the splinters from the wood. Without doing that, the bed is not fit for use and is not considered a vessel for the purpose of receiving impurity. However, if the bed somehow doesn't need sanding in order for it to be usable (just to make it look nicer), then it's considered to be in the category of גולמי כלי עץ שעתיד לשבץ ולשוף, which Bartenura says is susceptible to impurity (I didn't go look up the gemara in Chulin). That's how I understand the Bartenura. </p>\n\n<p>So it seems that this din isn't really such a big surprise. In this case, the reason the artisan did not apply the usual finishing touches was because they were not necessary to make the vessel fitting for use. If the bed had splinters still, it wouldn't become susceptible to impurity until it was sanded, regardless of what the worker planned to do. The other finishing touches in this chapter seem to be of the type that is required to make the vessel fitting for use. By our logic, the vessels would not become susceptible to impurity if the worker decided to skip them because the items would not be sufficiently usable.</p>\n\n\n",

If a man perverted his ways, his zivug is given to another, until he rectifies his ways. When he rectifies his ways and his time has come, the other man is pushed aside and he comes to takes what is his. This is the most difficult task for the Holy One, blessed be He, to banish one man because of another”.</p>\n<p>This suggests that in a case of what seems to be a “mistaken” match, one’s primary effort should be expended in teshuva and making oneself righteous while waiting for G-d to decide if he is in fact the right one and whether he is meritorious enough to deserve the woman he thinks is his zivug.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>To conclude:</h3>\n<p><strong>R' Ullman</strong> writes that all would agree (and this is the accepted approach) that one could pray that <strong>IF</strong> a particular woman is his zivug, that G-d enable the match to take place at the best time and in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>Key word here being \"<strong>IF</strong>\"- ie one shouldn't specifically daven \"<strong>FOR</strong>\" a specific woman to be his zivug.</p>\n\n\n",

It sounds almost like Rashi is saying \"Hey, just giving you heads up, we have a good Pshat coming up\". Do we really need that introduction?

Why do we need him to explicitly say this is a good commentary?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Inspired by a (now deleted) comment on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105119/pshat-of-what-did-korach-take\">this question</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is addressed by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_HaLevi_Segal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Here are some reasons why:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>At the equator, the earth rotates about 1,000 miles in 1 hour. The speed is slower as you move away from the equator. But, based on this, alone. Babylon is less than 6,000 miles from Jerusalem.</p></li>\n<li><p>A Google search revealed that the GPS coordinates of Babylon, Iraq. Latitude: 32.5352 Longitude: 44.4192.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The latitude of Jerusalem, Israel is 31.771959, and the longitude is 35.217018</p>\n\n<p>We see that the latitude of the 2 places is about the same so the earth is rotating at about the same speed at both of these places.</p>\n\n<p>I'm aware that current time zone divisions don't completely coordinate with the earth's rotational speed, but, I gather that it's pretty close. However, as the Talmudic statement was made long before a concept of \"time zones\" as we have it, I assume that they calculated this on observation and compared the observations in both of these places.</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking how accurate they were based on current scientific calculations.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question is based on a misunderstanding of the gemara. The assertion here isn't that there is a 6-hour time difference between Eretz Yisrael and Bavel. Rather, the case refers back to the previous discussion in the gemara about determining whether the molad occurred before or after midday.</p>\n\n<p>First, some background. As we've already learned on this daf, the moon cannot be seen 6 hours before or after the molad due to its proximity in the sky to the sun (by definition, the molad occurs when the moon is directly between the earth and sun). Furthermore, it is an astronomical fact that at the time of a new moon, moonrise occurs at the same time as sunrise and moonset occurs at the same time as sunset. Finally, the molad is an astronomical phenomenon and doesn't occur at different times for different places in the world. Everybody, regardless of where they are in the world, can count down \"3. 2. 1. Happy Molad!\" together simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>The case quoted in the gemara here is where the molad occurs just before midday in Eretz Yisrael. At that time, the moon will already have not been seen for 18 hours (the previous six hours because the moon was too close to the sun and the 12 hours before that because the moon was below the horizon). Those 18 hours were all of the previous month, like R' Zeira said. After the molad, the moon will remain invisible for another 6 hours, making 24 hours total: 18 of the old month and 6 of the new. Six hours after the molad, the moon will be visible very briefly at the end of the day before setting below the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>Since the molad was just before midday in Israel, it occurs slightly after midday in Bavel (which is to the east of Israel). Let's call it 12:05. The moon was not visible for the previous 6 hours of the old month due to its proximity to the sun, but would have been briefly visible after rising around 6:00 until being obscured by the sun around 6:05. 6 hours after the molad, at 6:05 p.m., the moon will already have set, so it won't be visible until moonrise around 6:00 a.m. the next morning, 24 hours after it was last seen.</p>\n\n<p>So the gemara isn't saying that Israel and Bavel are 6 hours apart. On the contrary, their time difference is much smaller. That's why the moon is obscured for 24 hours in both places.</p>\n\n\n",

The first time he was in this world, he claimed, was in the period of the Jewish people in the desert at the time of the incident of the Rebellion of Korach and his congregation. Upon hearing this, the Yitav Lev asked his father to tell him about the events of that time. The Yismach Moshe told his son that all the Heads of the Sanhedrin sided with Korach and the masses of the people sided with Moshe. The Yitav Lev then pressed his father and asked him \"Who did you side with?\" He responded \"I was neutral\". The Yitav Lev asked him, how he could not support Moshe, when his greatness was so clear. The Yitav Lev told his son, “I can see that you have no inkling of what a great person Korach was.

    "content": "# Clarifying Korach's practical demands\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Pretty strangely for me, the Korach plans and intentions are widely discussed by interpreters (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40530/parshas-korach-what-was-korach-thinking\">this question</a>). In the Torah, He uttered two clear statements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>all the community are holy, all of them, and the LORD is in their midst. </li>\n<li>you raise yourselves above the LORD’s congregation (and maybe 3: You have gone too far.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But I don't see, in the text of the Parasha and the commentators, a list of clear demands Korach presented to Moses and Aharon.</p>\n\n<p>But what were his demands/propositions - what he expected Moses and Aharon to DO? </p>\n\n<p>Even if we say he wanted Moses and Aharon replaced, how did he propose to do that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>After some researching that didn't yield many results, I came up with my personal explanation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Matan Torah was a very special event, as many interpreters accept that the people \"returned to the point of Adam before his sin\". Its specialty was in the fact that all people were equal - G-d spoke/revealed Himself to men, women, children, Moses and Aharon and everybody.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, there were no classes or any hierarchy between the people (but maybe closeness to the mount). That was, by the way, the ultimate goal, as I understand. </p></li>\n<li><p>But people couldn't bear it for long and broke after only two commandments. But still it was only Moses and the rest. But after the sin of the Golden Calf, the people returned to the reality of hierarchy within the nation, creating classes and elites (Levites vs Israelites and Cohanim vs Levites).</p>\n\n<p>(As I mentioned, this is similar to Adam who was equal to Eve before the sin - כי מאיש לקחה זאת - and became superior to her after it.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The problem with this division was simple - G-d ('s providence) wasn't shared equally between all - more sacred people got \"more of G-d\" - As G-d dwells in the Mishkan close to Cohanim He doesn't dwell in all camp of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>(This is similar to the problem of the Temple - once G-d is concentrated there, \"less of G-d\" is left for others. That's why many say that the Mishkan was envisioned as the cure for the sin of the GC.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Korah noticed that Moses and Aharon actually enjoy that situation and greatly promote it, instead of trying to reverse to the point of Matan Torah:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"כָל־הָעֵדָה כֻּלָּם קְדֹשִׁים\" - make all equal</li>\n<li>\"וּבְתוֹכָם ה' וּמַדּוּעַ תִּתְנַשְּׂאוּ עַל־קְהַל ה'\" - G-d will be shared equally between all</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In other words, Korach demanded that Moses and Aharon step down in order to return to the higher state they experienced earlier and bring the final Geulah quick and easy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Seemingly the idea was inspiring, but it seems that the timing was bad (we know that many shortcuts didn't work in the Torah). Something went wrong and the gloomy finale we all know.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Rephrasing the verses, their argument goes something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Premise 1: A national revelation myth is a most compelling way to found a religion</p>\n  \n  <p>Premise 2: If so, we should find many religions throughout history based on national revelation</p>\n  \n  <p>Premise 3: But, Judaism is the only religion based on national revelation</p>\n  \n  <p>Conclusion: Judaism cannot have been fabricated</p>\n  \n  <p>TLDR; Judaism is true; because, it is the only religion based on national revelation, which is the best way to found a religion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe this is what's commonly referred to as the \"Kuzari Principle/Argument\".</p>\n\n<p>My question is twofold:</p>\n\n<p>1) This sounds to me like an <a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">argument from ignorance</a>, which both our sources (\"<a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לא ראינו אינה ראיה</a>\") and philosophy reject. Is this indeed an argument from ignorance?</p>\n\n<p>2) If so, why do these verses (and said Rabbis) appeal to such a fallacious argument?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. R' Lawrence Kelemen, R' Dovid Gottlieb, R' Zamir Cohen, R' Jonathan Sacks, R' Tovia Singer, and more.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I do not believe the Torah is putting forth a proof of its own truth. The passuk is telling us that we should consider these acts of God, which have not been claimed anywhere else, as a demonstration of God's greatness over all other forces. The miracles are assumed to be true, and we need a refresher of how to view them and appreciate what it means.</p>\n\n<p>As a proof of Judaism I agree that it falls short of being a true proof, but it is definitely a very strong argument in favor of Judaism. Actually, even if we could prove 100% that no other society ever made such a claim of mass Revelation that would still not translate into a rigorous proof of the truth of Judaism. The weakness in this proof is not that it is an argument from ignorance, but that it does not logically follow from the preposition that Judaism must be true.\nAgain, that does not take away from the value it does have as a strong argument in favor of Judaism, and it does not lose anything from its being an argument from ignorance. </p>\n\n<p>Now, if we would find another claim of mass Revelation that would undermine a major claim for Judaism's veracity, since necessarily one of the claims of mass Revelation would be false. The fact that we have never seen such a claim highlights the uniqueness of the claims that Judaism makes of God's involvement in the world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>(ECREE) - \"<strong>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidences</strong>\" (popularized by Carl Sagan).</p>\n\n<p>Indeed the Torah makes a bold claim - G-d revealed Himself to millions of people. But let's trace how the Torah itself treats this monumental event (based on the text and some basic Midrashim):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Judaism was found long before the revelation - actually it existed forever, from Adam, Shem, Avraham, Itzhak, Yakov, Jews studied Torah. We hold that all the forefathers also kept the whole Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mt. Sinai is situated far away from the civilization - amidst a desert, not in the middle of the settled world. A revelation on the Moon would have a similar impact.</p></li>\n<li><p>No other nations were invited to witness. No messengers were sent to inform the world. No written extra-Jewish evidence of the revelation. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Jews themselves didn't like the experience so much, they wanted to distance themselves, as G-d forced it upon them (\"כפה כליהם הר כגיגית\").</p></li>\n<li><p>All the practical information they got from that revelation was two commandments they already knew from the Exodus. All the rest of the Torah was passed through Moses' prophecies.</p></li>\n<li><p>40 days later the Jews forgot the experience completely (the Golden Calf)</p></li>\n<li><p>During their stay in the desert, they continuously behaved as if they didn't have that experience on Mt Sinai.</p></li>\n<li><p>All the generation of first-hand witnesses was killed during the next 40 years.</p></li>\n<li><p>Moses feels just right with reciting the whole Torah to the Dor Haaretz, with no additional revelations needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>(IIRC) G-d never ever reveals himself to a group of people, more than one person at a time.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So to your 1st question, I think, acc. to the Torah, G-d made it all very hard this event to disprove.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To your second Q., as Rambam doesn't see the importance of the event to include it in the 13 principles of our faith, in other words, believing literally in the authenticity of the event is not a requisite for being a Kosher Jew, I don't think we should use it. </p>\n\n<p>But wait, why not? If it makes people believe and get closer to Judaism? This is not a white lie, just an unsupported claim, that actually has very little importance in Judaism. If there ware no physical gathering at Mt Sinai and Moses still gave us the Torah, it would be the same.</p>\n\n<p>But again, while it IS a fallacious <em>argument</em>, claiming that the result has to be true, it doesn't make it a fallacious claim to start with. </p>\n\n\n",

We only don't say tachanun in the house of mourner due to \"מידת הדין מתוחה\" but this is not the case with tzidkoscha.</li>\n<li>Finally, the recitation of tzidkoscha was taken on (lit. 'acquired') upon the passing of Moshe Rabbeinu and Dovid HaMelech (who died according to the Zohar at Shabbos Mincha), and if this is the case then for sure it is fitting to say it in the house of mourner.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The support that he brings for those who don't say it - (see footnote 4) are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eliyah_Rabbah_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.292.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eliyah Rabbah 292:17</a> - Interestingly, he rejects the point mentioned in no. 6 above (he also adds that Yosef also died during this period of time) and meticulously knock off each case. Firstly, as per the Midrash on Parshas Vayeilech, Moshe tried to argue his case for Hashem not to let him die. Hashem responded that if He were to keep him alive it would effectively turn the Torah into a forgery/lie as it says expressly that he died. So that's why we say \"ותורתך אמת\" to negate this claim. With regards to Yosef, the Gemara tells us that he died before all his brothers even though he was a greater tzaddik as he acted with pride (ga'avah). And such is the great issur of gaavah that the Rabbeinu Chananel on the Gemara explains that Yosef used as it were, the sceptre of the King of Kings Hashem who dons Himself with a sense of pride when performing miracles and wonders such as Krias Yam Suf (the splitting of the Reed Sea). This is why we say in Tzidkoscha \"אשר עשית גדולות אלקים מי כמוך\" - \"That which You do is great, G-d who is like You\" i.e. no human being is comparable to that of Hashem. Finally, with Dovid the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.30b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> relates that Dovid did not want to die on Shabbos, but Hashem answers <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.38b.1?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"וְאֵין מַלְכוּת נוֹגַעַת בַּחֲבֶרְתָּהּ\"</a> - \" And one reign does not overlap with another (and deduct from the time allotted it even a hairbreadth)\". And this is why we say in Tzidkoscha \"צדקתך כהררי קל\" - \"Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He ends by writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב עולת תמיד בשם אבודרהם יש מקומות שאין אומרים צדקתך בבית האבל</p>\n<p>The Olas Tamid writes in the name of the Avudraham that there are places that don't say tzidkoscha in the house of a mourner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>He notes that it is likewise the custom of several European communities not to say it - 1) פירארא (couldn't work out this one?) 2) Frankfurt & 3) Worms</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In many places it is customary to have Shabbos Mincha service in the <em>Aveil</em>'s house in which case it would not be appropriate to Say <em>Tzidkoscho</em> as we are supporting G-d's Judgement for returning the Sinners to <em>Geihenom</em> after Shabbos as the Abudraham Explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צדקתך צדק לעולם ותורתך אמת כנגד דינה של גהינם ששואלין תחלה למת למה לא עסקת בתורה שנקראת אמת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the very reason why we don't say tachanun in the Mourners house.

It only says that some authorities allow a six-year-old boy to count as the tenth in a minyan, provided he holds a Chumash or Sefer Torah and understands what he is doing [Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayyim 55:4]. Some, led by the Ri (Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel the Elder of Dampierre) reject this view. The current practice is that some permit it only in extraordinary circumstances [The Rosh and Mordechai and Hagahot Maimoni Chapter 9 of the Laws of Prayer].</p>\n\n<p>So, is there any basis in our tradition for this practice in non-traditional synagogues?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R David Sperling at yeshiva.co <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=7713\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> addresses your question and brings a number of rejected opinions - to be clear the <em>halacha</em> remains that a Torah scroll does not count as a tenth in a minyan</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>In regards the question of using a Sefer Torah as the \"tenth man\" in a\n  minyan – yes this does have a vague hint of a source</strong>. Firstly, the\n  Talmud (Brachot 47b) when discussing forming a minyan for saying zimun\n  before grace after meals (with Hashem's name in it), says \"Said Rav\n  Huna, \"<strong>Nine and the Aron [Kodesh] join up [to be counted as ten]</strong>\". The\n  Talmud immediately rejects this and says \"Is the Aron a person!\". This\n  then may be the (rejected) source for the idea that the Sefer Torah\n  counts for a minyan.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, we do find some reference in halacha to some form of using a\n  sefer Torah for a minyan. The Shulchan Aruch (Orach Haim 55,4) talks\n  about including a boy less than bar-mitzvah age as the tenth for a\n  minyan, and writes that this is forbidden. The Rema adds that there\n  are those that in a time of need do rely on using a child, as long as\n  he is holding a Chumash in his hands. The overwhelming consensus of\n  Rabinic opinion is not to rely on this opinion even in times of need\n  (see Mishna Brurah there).</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The source for the idea that a minor holding a chumash or Sefer Torah\n  might be counted for a minyan is discussed by the Rosh</strong> (Berachot 7,\n  20) where he discusses at length the opinions that allow one child to\n  be counted towards a minyan, and he writes \"The only source for this\n  [counting a child who is holding a chumash] is Pirkei d'R. Eliezer,\n  regarding Ibur Shanah [declaring a leap year]. There, it mentions a\n  Sefer Torah. <strong>It says that R. Eliezer requires ten for Ibur Shanah, and\n  if we lack one, we bring a Sefer Torah</strong>. It does not say that the minor\n  holds it. Even if there is such a source regarding Tefilah, this is\n  only for a Sefer Torah or Chumash, i.e. one Sefer of the Torah written\n  on parchment. Chazal did not have [printed] Chumashim like we do.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Yerushalmi says \"a minor and a Sefer Torah, we include them for\n  10.\"</strong> This means a minor or a Sefer Torah, just like nine men and the Aron. The Halachah does not follow the Yerushalmi. Some texts of the\n  Yerushalmi say \"a minor and a Sefer Torah, we include <em>oto</em> (him, or\n  it).\" This is like the custom (that the minor holds the Sefer). Or,\n  perhaps it means that a minor may be counted among the seven required\n  Aliyos.\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>From here we see that in fact there is a situation where a Sefer Torah\n  makes up a minyan (for declaring a leap year) according to one\n  opinion, and perhaps even for a minyan for prayer, according to the\n  Yerusalemi Talmud. However, the halacha is not like this source</strong>, and\n  we do not use a Sefer Torah (nor a child) as a \"tenth man\" for a\n  minyan. {In extreme situations a community should consult there Rabbi\n  as to the advisability of relying on the minor opinions that allow\n  counting a child who is holding a Sefer Torah for a minyan}.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For those asking to see the Yerushalmi inside, it was too long to include in a comment.

The purpose was homiletic, to exhort the masses and inspire them, rather than to be a valid kal vachomer.</p>\n<p>Your question indeed comes out of the very text of the gemara in Arachin</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא א\"ר אלעזר בן פרטא בוא וראה כמה גדול כח של לשון הרע מנלן ממרגלים ומה המוציא שם רע על עצים ואבנים כך המוציא שם רע על חבירו על אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Elazar ben Perata says: Come and see how great the power of malicious speech is. From where do we derive this? From the punishment received by the spies. And if one who defames the wood and rocks of Eretz Yisrael received such a severe punishment, then with regard to one who defames another person, all the more so will he be punished severely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If it is indeed an explicit kal vachomer, and a <em>real</em> one, then we would expect the punishment for the <em>chomer</em> to be at least as severe as the <em>kal</em>.</p>\n<p>Another example of the <em>kal vachomer</em> in the homiletic genre:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַלּוֹמֵד מֵחֲבֵרוֹ פֶּרֶק אֶחָד אוֹ הֲלָכָה אַחַת אוֹ פָסוּק אֶחָד אוֹ דִבּוּר אֶחָד אוֹ אֲפִלּוּ אוֹת אַחַת, צָרִיךְ לִנְהוֹג בּוֹ כָבוֹד, שֶׁכֵּן מָצִינוּ בְדָוִד מֶלֶךְ יִשְׂרָאֵל, שֶׁלֹּא לָמַד מֵאֲחִיתֹפֶל אֶלָּא שְׁנֵי דְבָרִים בִּלְבָד, קְרָאוֹ רַבּוֹ אַלּוּפוֹ וּמְיֻדָּעוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהלים נה) וְאַתָּה אֱנוֹשׁ כְּעֶרְכִּי אַלּוּפִי וּמְיֻדָּעִי. וַהֲלֹא דְבָרִים קַל וָחֹמֶר, וּמַה דָּוִד מֶלֶךְ יִשְׂרָאֵל, שֶׁלֹּא לָמַד מֵאֲחִיתֹפֶל אֶלָּא שְׁנֵי דְבָרִים בִּלְבַד קְרָאוֹ רַבּוֹ אַלּוּפוֹ וּמְיֻדָּעוֹ, הַלּוֹמֵד מֵחֲבֵרוֹ פֶּרֶק אֶחָד אוֹ הֲלָכָה אַחַת אוֹ פָסוּק אֶחָד אוֹ דִבּוּר אֶחָד אוֹ אֲפִלּוּ אוֹת אַחַת, עַל אַחַת כַּמָּה וְכַמָּה שֶׁצָּרִיךְ לִנְהוֹג בּוֹ כָבוֹד. וְאֵין כָּבוֹד אֶלָּא תוֹרָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (משלי ג) כָּבוֹד חֲכָמִים יִנְחָלוּ, (משלי כח) וּתְמִימִים יִנְחֲלוּ טוֹב, וְאֵין טוֹב אֶלָּא תוֹרָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (משלי ד) כִּי לֶקַח טוֹב נָתַתִּי לָכֶם תּוֹרָתִי אַל תַּעֲזֹבוּ:</p>\n<p>One who learns from his fellow one chapter, or one halakhah, or one verse, or one word, or even one letter, is obligated to treat him with honor; for so we find with David, king of Israel, who learned from Ahitophel no more than two things, yet called him his master, his guide and his beloved friend, as it is said, “But it was you, a man mine equal, my guide and my beloved friend” (Psalms 55:14). Is this not [an instance of the argument] “from the less to the greater” (kal vehomer)? If David, king of Israel who learned from Ahitophel no more than two things, nevertheless called him his master, his guide and his beloved friend; then in the case of one who learns from his fellow one chapter, or one halakhah, or one verse, or one word, or even one letter, all the more so he is under obligation to treat him with honor. And “honor’” means nothing but Torah, as it is said, “It is honor that sages inherit” (Proverbs 3:35). “And the perfect shall inherit good” (Proverbs 28:10), and “good” means nothing but Torah, as it is said, “For I give you good instruction; do not forsake my Torah” (Proverbs 4:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me ask you whether this kal vachomer is valid. David learned two halachot from Achitofel. So I can understand the kal vachomer to a chapter. But not to a single halacha, or a verse, or a word, or one letter! The answer is that while employing the structure of kal vachomer, it is not meant to be so solid.</p>\n<p>One could proffer other answers, but I would personally swat them away. For example, someone in the comments suggested that it was lashon hara (actually blasphemy) against Hashem. Yes, that is exactly what the gemara in Arachin asks as a question, based on a statement by Rabbi Chanina bar Pappa. If blasphemy, how could you extract the homiletic lesson that it was lashon hara. And they answer by citing another pasuk that shows that it was the lashon hara and not the blasphemy.</p>\n<p>One could answer that they deserved a punishment. And other factors transformed it into a very severe punishment. So, the meraglim said lashon hara, but it was part of a larger rebellion. Miriam's actions meanwhile were private, she had various merits, has a brother who Hashem knew would pray for her. What about tzaraat as a punishment for people in general.</p>\n<p>One could answer that the death penalty is only imposed after a warning. That is, you need a pasuk for an azhara and a separate pasuk for the onesh. Miriam was the first actor to perform lashon hara in the midbar. Rashi on the transition from Behaalotecha to Shelach says that the juxtaposition is because the meraglim saw Miriam's punishment and did not take heed. That still would not answer why, in general, tzaraat would be the punishment rather than death.</p>\n<p>I would return, therefore, to my first answer. Nu, nu, don't look too closely at this homiletic kal vachomer and insist that it work in every respect. Rather, observe a grievous punishment, and take the mussar.</p>\n\n\n",

The cities of refuge are cities given to the Levites in place of the land that other tribes get.  There's a dispute in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makkot.2.8?lang=bi&with=Makkot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 2:8</a> about whether the accidental killer pays rent or lives there rent-free (the <em>g'mara</em> clarifies that this might be about the 6 vs the 42 cities), but even if he doesn't pay rent, he still needs food and clothing.  And if he has family \"back home\", they need to be provided for somehow.</p>\n\n<p>How did this work?  Many accidental killers would presumably have been farmers, a trade they can't as easily ply in their new homes.  Did they take up some other trade?  Did somebody sustain them (and if so, who)?  Did they beg in the streets?  Did someone bring them money periodically (perhaps funds raised from their property back home)?  Something else?</p>\n\n<p>The <em>mishna</em> in 2:6 says that mothers of high priests would provide food and clothing so the exiled wouldn't pray for their sons' deaths, but that seems impractical at scale.  Did the mother of the current high priest really supply all the needed food and clothing for every accidental killer in every one of the 48 cities?  I understood that to be more of an occasional supplement, but that's just my own reading of it.</p>\n\n\n",

The verse states that they are all “given from one shepherd.” One God gave them, One leader said them from the mouth of the Master of all creation etc. You too; make your ears like a funnel and acquire for yourself an understanding heart to hear the opinions of those who rule things to be ritually impure and the opinion of those who rule them pure; the opinion of those who prohibit and the opinion of those who permit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (Avoida Zara 7a) brings a <em>machlokes</em> on what to do when faced with a dispute in practical halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היו שנים אחד מטמא ואחד מטהר אחד אוסר ואחד מתיר: אם היה אחד מהם גדול\nמחבירו בחכמה ובמנין הלך אחריו, ואם לאו הלך אחר המחמיר. ר' יהושע בן\nקרחה אומר בשל תורה הלך אחר המחמיר בשל סופרים הלך אחר המיקל</p>\n<p>If there are two opinions - one rules it is pure, the other <em>tamei</em>; one forbids and the other permitts: [The opinion of the <em>Tanna Kama</em>] If one of them is greater in wisdom or number, follow him. If not, follow the more stingent position. R' Yehoshua ben Korcha said: Regarding Biblical Prohibitions, follow the stringent position. Regarding Rabbinical prohibitions, follow the lenient opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When faced with two dissenting opinions, one does not have the right to choose the position he prefers (at least when applicable to Biblical prohibitions). [We pasken like R' Yehoshua b Korcha - see YD 242 with Shach]</p>\n<p>The Ritva qualifies this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והוי יודע דכי אמרינן הלך אחר המחמיר, היינו לדידן דכיון דספיקא הוא\nנקטינן בספקא דאוריתא לחומרא אבל לדידהו גופייהו ודאי כיון דשקולין נינהו\nוכל אחד עומד בשמועתו זה נוהג כדבריו אפילו לקולא וזה נוהג כדבריו והכי\nמוכח ביבמות פרק קמא ודאמר נמי דאחרים הבאין לעשות בהוראתן הולכין אחר\nהמחמיר בדאורייתא דוקא בענין אחר כיוצא בזה שנחלקו אלו אבל באותה חתיכה\nעצמה שנחלקו בה כיון דשקולין הם וכי הדרי איפליגו בה אין הוראת איסור חל\nבאותה חתיכה והכי מוכח התם ביבמות דאמרינן התם דבית הילל ובית שמאי אלו\nעושין כדבריהם ואלו עושין כדבריהם והיו מתירין צרת הבת לאחין והיתה מותרת\nלינשא להם שעל כל אחד ואחד שהיה מעשה בא עליה היו מורין לה בה להיתר ואלו\nלא היה לזה לעשות בהוראתם כנגד דב\"ה לא היו מורין בה להיתר אלא ודאי שמע\nמינה שאותה אשה מותרת היתה לינשא על פיהן׳ – כלומר שאע״פ שבעלמא צריך\nלחשוש לדברי המחמיר לגבי דיני דאורייתא, היכא ששמע פסק מפי המיקל הרי זה\nמותר לגבי חתיכה אחת, ומותרת לו להקל לכתחילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ritva makes two important points:\n(a) This ruling is only to us (students) who don't have an opinion of our own; the one who presents the lenient position himself may continue to follow his own opinion and need not submit to the stringent position [even regarding Biblical prohibitions];\n(b) One who recieves a lenient ruling directly from the lenient <em>posek</em> may follow that position regarding that specific scenario; only in subsequent similar shailos must he defer to the stringent ruling.</p>\n<p>The Chazon Ish (YD 150.5) adds another factor - one who chooses a Rabbi for himself, and follows his rulings on all halachic matters may be lenient for his opinion even when faced with a stringent dissenting view. (Like <em>talmidei Beis Shamai</em> could follow <em>Beis Shammai</em>).</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<p>(a) If you are confident in your own opinion [provided you are qualified to <em>have</em> an opinion], you may follow your own conclusions.</p>\n<p>(b) If you have a specific Rabbi whose opinion you follow in all halachic matters, you may follow his opinion,</p>\n<p>(c) If you recieve a ruling from a specific <em>posek</em>, you may follow his ruling even when faced with dissenting stringent views,</p>\n<p>(d) If you do not have your own opinion, your own Rabbi or a specific Psak, you must follow the stringent ruling (when relative to Biblical commandments).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I'd suggest we follow our Rabbis in this. As we can clearly see they don't have any clear method of deciding themselves.

There's no necessity/obligation of accepting one Rabbi's ruling over another.</p></li>\n<li><p>There's no personal obligation of consistency either, however, some dramatic changes in tradition require breaking a sort of Neder (one who did something for 3 times in a row), especially for leniency.</p></li>\n<li><p>There's only one real and mandatory requirement for following any way you like, and that's the (one before) last Rashi on Koheles on the verse: \"סוֹף דָּבָר הַכֹּל נִשְׁמָע אֶת הָאֱלֹהִים יְרָא.:\"<br>\n\"<strong>מַה שֶׁתּוּכַל עֲשֵׂה, וְלִבְּךָ לַשָּׁמָיִם:</strong>\". Meaning, whatever you follow, be sure you're free from personal whims and caprices and be sure all you desire is to serve G-d properly.<br>\nThat basically falls under \"וְצַדִּיק בֶּאֱמוּנָתוֹ יִחְיֶה\" - once you feel you're a Tzadik (no personal profit) you can act according to your beliefs.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

If one says that \"Reuven is in the house\", and he is indeed in the house, although technically true, that is not considered an ultimate truth, since it is possible that Reuven would not be in the house. The Torah, however is an ultimate truth that is impossible for it to be any other way. <strong>Since Korach denied the validity of the ultimate truth, he was no longer fitting to exist.</strong> Therefore it is not appropriate for him to die in a normal or natural way or even to enter the grave \"dead\", but rather <strong>he needed to be swallowed up by the ground alive since he obviated his own existence while alive,</strong> by denying the ultimate truth.</p>\n\n<p>The emphasis of the Maharal is on the fact they went to the grave alive. Any other punishment would have killed them, which would be inappropriate given the nature of their sin. They needed to go to the grave \"alive\", something not just uncommon, but fundamentally unnatural since they denied the fundamental truth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramban writes (as well as other meforshim point this idea out, for example, Rabbeinu Bachya) that the splitting of the ground was meant to be a totally new and unique (as well as supernatural) phenomena that was unlike any other natural occurrence.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban explains how this was so different from a regular earthquake:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם בריאה יברא ה' כתב ר\"א יש אומרים כי בריאה תורה על המצא יש מאין וכבר\n  נבקעו מדינות רבות וירדו הדרים בהן שאולה אבל פירושה כטעם גזרה מן וברא\n  אותהן (יחזקאל כג מז) והנכון שתאמר על המצא דבר מאין כי אין אצלנו בלשון\n  הקדש מורה על זה זולתי המלה הזאת אבל הענין <strong>כי בקיעת האדמה אינה בריאה\n  מחודשת אבל פתיחת הארץ את פיה לבלוע הוא חדוש לא נהיה מעולם כי כאשר תבקע\n  האדמה כמו שנעשה פעמים רבים ברעש הנקרא זלזלה תשאר פתוחה גם ימלא הבקע\n  מים ויעשה כאגמים אבל שתפתח ותסגר מיד כאדם הפותח פיו לבלוע ויסגור אותו\n  אחרי בלעו זה הדבר נתחדש ביום ההוא כאלו הוא נברא מאין</strong> וזה טעם ותכס\n  עליהם הארץ (פסוק לג) ולכך אמר הכתוב אחרי ותבקע האדמה (פסוק לא) ותפתח\n  הארץ את פיה ותבלע אותם (פסוק לב) ועל דעת רבותינו (סנהדרין קי) בקרוב\n  פתח גיהנם גם הוא ענין נתחדש לשעתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If Hashem will create a [new] creation. Splitting open the ground was\n  not in fact a new creation, but that the ground would open its mouth\n  and swallow them alive was something new that had never happened. When\n  the earth splits, as has happened many times in an earthquake, it\n  remains open, and the cracks later fill with water and become like\n  lakes. <strong>However, that the earth should open and close immediately, as a\n  man opens his mouth to swallow and closes it after he swallows — this\n  was created afresh on that day as if it were created from nothing.</strong>\n  This is the explanation of (v. 33), “and the earth covered them,” and\n  therefore it says: “The ground beneath them split. The earth opened\n  its mouth and swallowed them.” According to the teaching of our Rabbis\n  (Sanhedrin 110a) the opening of Gehinnom drew close to them; this was\n  newly created on that day as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Applying this Ramban to your question, why it didn’t happen in another way, perhaps if it was lightening or any other type of events, it wouldn’t have been as discernible from other natural occurrences as much as the earth opening and closing like a mouth</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I can think of three answers (based on lessons by rav Boruch Rosenblum) -\n1.It was written that Moshe was the modest man on earth and we have Korach as an opposite character - so the earth made a job here.\n2.If a man has some bad character traits - this somehow will reflect sooner or later on his grandsons. The only way to avoid is to take a man out of this world being a live. It means Moshe knew about Shmuel.\n3.Since Korach went against Oral Torah and the Tora was given under the Har Sinai, so the punishment was that the mountain (earth) went down Korach!</p>\n\n\n",

How is it that it became the name of a Jewish month given the prohibition of וְשֵׁ֨ם אֱלֹהִ֤ים אֲחֵרִים֙ לֹ֣א תַזְכִּ֔ירוּ לֹ֥א יִשָּׁמַ֖ע עַל־פִּֽיךָ, namely, that it is forbidden to speak the names of such deities?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer is that once the month was named after the deity, the name Tammuz is no longer solely considered the name of a deity, but rather the name of a month. The advantage of this answer is that, if true, it would also explain our use of the names of the days of the week, such as Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, which are all named for pagan deities. Although the origins of these names are pagan, they have taken on a new meaning and we do not need to look back at the etymology of these words. </p>\n\n\n",

Consequently, the first-generation listener (one of the three) should not be permitted to tell him, because he will transgress לפני עור by telling him something he is not permitted to listen to.

One of the three listeners can then go tell three more people the lashon hara he heard: for <em>him</em> it's not lashon hara, as he was one of three to hear it from the original teller. For the listeners it's <em>also</em> not lashon hara, as they are also a group of three, to whom applies the heter of b'apei T'lasa.

Avraham Chaim Levin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה במקום שיש אחרים רואין אם יש דיני הרחקות באשתו נדה שמסתפק כתר\"ה דאולי יש להתיר משום דאז אין בו רעיון של קירוב וגם שבא מזה לידי בזיון להאשה ויש בזה משום כבוד הבריות</p>\n<p>Behold, in a place where there are others watching, do the laws of <em>harchakot</em> with one's <em>niddah</em> wife apply – for His Honor is uncertain that perhaps we allow it because in such a situation there is no concept of closeness and also because it will lead to embarrassment for the woman [that people know that she is a <em>niddah</em>], and this is [an issue of] human dignity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Feinstein addressed the embarrassment/human dignity aspect towards the end of the reponsum:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומטעם שהוא כבזיון לה ויש בזה משום כבוד הבריות לא חששו משום שאין בזה בזיון כ\"כ דידוע לכל שהנשים הן נדות י\"ב יום בכל חדש כשאינן זקנות ולא מעוברות וצריכין להתרחק מבעליהן באיזה דברים ואדרבה הא הרבה היו לובשות בגדים מיוחדים לימי הנדות ומזה היו יודעות השכנות שהיא נדה אלמא שלא היו מתביישות בזה ומה שמתביישות כשהיא נמצאת עם אלו שאינן שומרות דיני התורה אין להחשיב בושת כזה לכבוד הבריות להתיר איסורים ואף לא מנהג ישראל בשביל זה כיון דאדרבה טוב שלא תתבייש אף לפניהן בקיום מצות התורה ומה שמצינו בנדה דף ע\"א בראשונה היו מטבילין כלים ע\"ג נדות מתות והיו נדות חיות מתביישות והתקינו מחמת זה לב\"ש שיהיו מטבילים ע\"ג כל הנשים אינו משום שיש בושת לפרסם שהיא נדה אלא מטעם שפרש\"י שם שמתביישין בזה שאפילו במיתתן הן משונים מכל אדם ואדרבה משמע שלא הוי הבושת גם שם במה שידעו שמתה נדה אלא משום שמתנהגין במיתת נדה שלא כמו שנוהגין עם כל אדם במיתתן</p>\n<p>And as for the reason that it's like an embarrassment for her and it's [an issue of] human dignity, they are not concerned since it is not such an embarrassment. For it is known to all that women are <em>niddot</em> 12 days out of every month when they're not old or pregnant, and they have to stay away from their husbands in various matters. And on the contrary – many would wear special clothes for the days of <em>niddut</em>, and thus the neighbors would know that she is a <em>niddah</em>, so we see that they were not embarrassed by this.</p>\n<p>And that which they are embarrassed when they are found with these [people] who don't keep the laws of the Torah, this type of embarrassment should not be considered [an issue of] human dignity to undo prohibitions or even Jewish customs on account of it, since on the contrary it is better to not be embarrassed even in their presence for fulfilling the commandments of the Torah.</p>\n<p>And that which we find in Niddah 71a [that] originally they would immerse vessels used by dying <em>niddot</em> and the living <em>niddot</em> were embarrassed, and they instituted on account of this - according to Beit Shammai – that they would immerse vessels used by all women, was not because it's embarrassing to publicize that she's a <em>niddah</em>; rather it was because of the reason explained by Rashi there, that they are embarrassed about this that even when they die they are different from all people. And on the contrary, it implies that there was no embarrassment there in that they knew that a <em>niddah</em> died, but that they would deal with the death of a <em>niddah</em> differently from the death of any other person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this reponsum we see that R. Feinstein clearly rejected the negative association with knowing someone's <em>niddah</em> status, and specifically mentioned the special clothes as one of the proofs that there is no negative association. In fact, he didn't even mention the possibility that it is a <em>tzniut</em> concern (but only that the women might be embarrassed), presumably because such a concern does not exist. R. Levin as well apparently did not mention <em>tzniut</em> in his question, again leading the reader to believe that the only concern was embarrassment and not <em>tzniut</em>. The reasoning may be, as mentioned in the responsum regarding embarrassment, that it is a normal function that everyone knows about anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

Surely Hashem created the world for the use in the appropriate way of all living things.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CC9rTTj8hMQJ:https://www.ou.org/life/torah/mm_borei_nefashot/%20&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> explains that there are actually <strong>three</strong> parts, not two. Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Tur (OC 207) explains that this berakha consists of three distinct\n  parts, almost like three separate blessings:</p>\n  \n  <p>First, we acknowledge that HaShem provides the needs of all souls, of\n  everything He created. “Who creates many souls and [fills] their\n  deficiency”, that is, provides for their needs.</p>\n  \n  <p>Second, we thank Him for everything He created in order to enliven us.\n  This includes enjoyments which are not in the category of a need or\n  lack, but rather are pleasures which enliven us. “For everything He\n  created, in order to enliven all living things.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Finally, we acknowledge that HaShem is the “life of the worlds”.</p>\n  \n  <p>Indeed, according to the Yerushalmi (Berakhot 6:1), the body of this\n  blessing says merely: “Who creates many souls in order to enliven the\n  soul of every living thing.” Here it seems clear that the term\n  “nefashot” or souls refers to the food we eat. According to the\n  Yerushalmi’s wording, the blessing explicitly refers to the hidden\n  spirituality present in all permissible pleasures of this world; and\n  even the customary wording implicitly hints at this spirituality and\n  soulfulness.</p>\n  \n  <p>Secondly, the plain sense of the wording suggests that we are thanking\n  God for our deficiencies! We interpreted this as thanks for filling\n  deficiency. Yet the concepts are related, for we get a sense of\n  satisfaction from eating only because we feel hunger. And on the\n  spiritual level, we are able to assimilate and absorb the “souls” of\n  the permitted food only because they correspond to a particular\n  spiritual hunger, which we have exactly because of our “deficiency” –\n  which is just another way of saying a potential for growth.</p>\n  \n  <p>The second part of the berakha continues in the same vein, referring\n  to the ability of God’s creation to enliven and invigorate us\n  spiritually – to enliven the soul of all living things. Again, the\n  emphasis is on the ability of material pleasures to provide spiritual\n  sustenance. <strong>Rebbe Natan of Breslav explains that this is why we give\n  precedence in blessings to foods we like better: our personal likes\n  and dislikes testify to our spiritual needs</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>The closing of the blessing refers to HaShem as “the life of the\n  worlds”. In the mystic tradition, this particular appellation refers\n  to that aspect of God’s providence that provides an interface between\n  the material and the spiritual worlds. (See for example Zohar Chayei\n  Sarah I:132a.) It is through this interface that the material world is\n  enlivened, for without spiritual force from on high the world would\n  wither instantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This Rosh Yeshiva said that there are times when our actions as a nation may cause Hashem to remove certain foresight from Gedolei Yisroel. </p>\n\n<p>Where is this concept mentioned?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Gittin 56b seems the clearest example, and I have heard this quoted in regards to the Holocaust. Raban Yochanan ben Zakai, effectively chief rabbi of the Jews, is negotiating with the Roman Emperor Vespasian just outside of Jerusalem, shortly before the Romans attack the city (c. 70 CE):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בעי מינאי מידי דאתן לך אמר ליה תן לי יבנה וחכמיה ושושילתא דרבן גמליאל ואסוותא דמסיין ליה לרבי צדוק קרי עליה רב יוסף ואיתימא רבי עקיבא (ישעיהו מד) משיב חכמים אחור ודעתם יסכל איבעי למימר ליה לשבקינהו הדא זימנא והוא סבר דלמא כולי האי לא עביד והצלה פורתא נמי לא הוי</p>\n<p>Vespasian told the rabbi -- <em>ask of me something I can give you.</em> He replied: <em>give me [the Northern city of] Yavneh and is scholars</em>; <em>the lineage of Raban Gamliel</em>; <em>and doctors to heal Rabbi Tzadok.</em></p>\n<p>[Decades later], Rav Yosef -- or some say Rabbi Akiva, commented on this encounter by quoting the verse (Isaiah 44): <em><strong>He pushes the wise aside, and their minds go foolish.</strong></em> <strong>He should have asked to leave [Jerusalem] alone that time!</strong>\n[What was RYBZ doing planning a post-Temple Judaism when the Roman leader could have called off the Jerusalem campaign entirely!] RYBZ himself thought that if the Roman was asked for all of that, he would refuse and not even minor relief would occur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Gemara is saying G-d kept Raban Yochanan ben Zakai from logic that could have prevented the Second Temple's destruction; it's not a difficult jump from that to many rabbis' suggestions to stay in Eastern Europe. (I don't see anything about this <em>per se</em> being the nation's fault; once the nation no longer deserved a Temple, the Talmud here is saying G-d allowed the pieces to fall into place.)</p>\n\n\n",

I am often reminded of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Eduyot.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eduyos 2:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Zevachim.12.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 12:4</a>, in which the chakhomim tell Rabbi Akiva that \"אין לא ראינו ראיה\" (\"We did not see it\" is not a proof).</p>\n\n<p>Given, however, that the chakhomim <em>had</em> to say this to Rabbi Akiva, and given that he <em>did</em> just use it as a proof, does that mean that Rabbi Akiva didn't hold to this principle?</p>\n\n<p>Did Rabbi Akiva believe that not ever having seen something accounted to an argument in favour of that thing's non-existence?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<ol>\n<li>Absence of proof is not proof of absence, but it is a strong indicator of absence</li>\n<li>The degree to which \"לא ראינו\" is an indication of absence depends on the size of the domain. If we are dealing with the whole planet as the domain, but our area of observation is only our local vicinity, then absence of proof is a very poor indicator for the whole domain. If our area of observation covers the full domain, then it is a strong indication of absence, but still not a proof.</li>\n<li>Rabi Chanina's observation covered many years of Temple activity, which was the relevant domain. His lack of observation was a very strong indicator that the non-observed behavior was halachically precluded, and that is why he did not observe it.</li>\n<li>Halachically we rarely require proof, we only need a strong indication (\"חזקה\", or related concepts). Even two witnesses is far from being a proof, but it is accepted absolutely.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>R' Akiva believed that the \"לא ראינו\" of Rabbi Chanina was sufficient to be a halachic basis for determining that it was a matter of law, while the Chachamim argued that it was not an acceptable basis even as an indicator of likelihood.</p>\n\n\n",

And this is because the majority of them live in the deserts where water is greatly needed and the rise and fall of the water is determined by the moon, and the gaon continued- the Rambam didn't rule that they were idolaters because he lived in the Islamic lands, and such a ruling was dangerous and pikuach nefesh, and l'ma'aseh, one should be moderate and follow the view that says that indeed, they aren't idolaters. Until here his words. And whoever sees this will see that according to his view, all of the teachings of the Rambam are like Tohu and meaningless, for all that he ruled was out of fear from them [the Muslims], and it seems to me that after asking for great forgiveness, one should doubt whether the holy mouth of the Gaon the Rogotchovi even said so, for if this was because the Rambam was afraid of ruling that they had a status of idolaters, he should have remained silent and not write clearly several times that they aren't included amongst idolaters, and a great fault has come from this, and moreover, the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch who weren't subject to the Ishmaelites didn't opine so in the teachings of the Rambam for they ruled [like the Rambam] in halacha, and even the Rashba in Torat Habayit and all the commentators mentioned above didn't opine so. And moreover, even the Ran in Sanhedrin (there), who wrote that they have a status of idolaters didn't write so from the reason that they bowed to the moon but because they bow to Muhammad, and especially because I didn't see that the Gaon R' Yosef Ruzhin zt\"l wrote so in his books, and one doesn't prove anything from fables as halacha, and this is simple.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Having checked Borochov's book and finding that it merely says \"מפי השמועה\", it seems that Rabbi Kachlon's explanation still holds...</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Ḥisda said: And that</strong> is only the <em>halakha</em> in a case where the three individuals <strong>came from three groups of three people each</strong>. <strong>Rava</strong> <strong>said: We only said</strong> this <em>halakha</em> in a case <strong>where those</strong> members of the previous groups <strong>did not include them in the <em>zimmun</em> in their</strong> original <strong>place, but in a case where they included them in the <em>zimmun</em> in their</strong> original <strong>place, their</strong> obligation to participate in a <strong><em>zimmun</em> has left them. Rava said: From where do I</strong> derive to <strong>say this <em>halakha</em>? As we learned</strong> in a mishna: <strong>A</strong> ritually <strong>impure bed, half of which was stolen or half of which was lost, or it was divided by brothers</strong> after they inherited it from their father, or was divided by <strong>partners, it is ritually pure.</strong> However, <strong>if they restored it</strong> and reattached the parts, <strong>it is susceptible to ritual impurity from here on.</strong> Rava infers: <strong>From here on, yes, retroactively, no. Apparently, once they divided it, the ritual impurity left it. Here, too, once they included them in the <em>zimmun</em>, their</strong> obligation <strong>left them</strong> and they do not reassume their previous obligation. [translation from Sefaria, with some explanations cut out]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does Rava really learn this halakha from the mishna, or is it just a comparison (as a memory aide)? Why does Rava pick this particular mishna (as his source)? As the (cut-out) explanation on Sefaria says about the metal bed: \"This is true with regard to any ritually impure utensil that was broken or divided; it is no longer a utensil and is therefore ritually pure.\" Indeed, the idea of tumah returning upon building something out of broken pieces only applies to metal utensils, so wouldn't a comparison to a non-metal utensil be more effective? Is there a deeper connection that I'm missing?</p>\n\n\n",

Although by all <em>chaluyos</em> of <em>dovor sh'berva</em> we need <em>eidim lkiyum</em> (like <em>gerushin</em> and <em>kiddushin</em>, and others), there are two reasons why <em>nissuin</em> is different:</p>\n\n<p>1) The Gemara in Kiddushin 65a writes that using the concept of <em>hoda'as baal din k'meah eidim dami</em>, one can circumvent the requirement for <em>eidim</em>, and the Kiddushin would theoretically be valid without <em>eidim</em>. (It is beyond the scope of this answer to explain how the two concept are interlinked). The reason the Gemara gives why this doesn't work is because when it is <em>chav l'acheirim</em> - detrimental to others - the concept of <em>hoda'as baal din</em> does not apply. Kiddushin is considered <em>chav l'acheirim</em> [either because the marriage causes the woman to become forbidden to all others, or because it causes him/her to become forbidden to each other's realtives - see Rashi & Rashba Kiddushin 65). Nissuin, however, is not <em>chav l'acheirim</em>, because both the relatives and the rest of the world are all already forbidden with the <em>Kiddushin</em>. </p>\n\n<p>2) According to some (notably, R' Chaim Solovetzik), the requirement for <em>eidi kiyum</em> is only by a '<em>chalos ha'adam</em>' (in Achronistic parlance), not by a '<em>chalos hatorah</em>'. Nissuin is considered a <em>chalos hatorah</em>, and therefore does not require <em>eidim lkiyum</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, some Poskim (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14552&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or Someach</a>, linked by @JoelK)  do not require <em>eidim</em> by Nissuin. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Avnei Miluim (37:18) and HaMakneh (EH §50) rule that it is required. The simple reading of the Tosfos Ri Hazaken in Kiddushin 10a is that Nissuin does require <em>eidim</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Would it make a difference if he was wearing tefillin while doing so, given that the prohibition of \"impure thoughts\" while wearing tefillin is generally held to be still more stringent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The simple answer to the question in your title is yes. As Rambam explains in Mishnah Torah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Tefillah v'Birchat Kohanim, Chapter 1, halacha 2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּלְפִיכָךְ נָשִׁים וַעֲבָדִים חַיָּבִין בִּתְפִלָּה לְפִי שֶׁהִיא מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה שֶׁלֹּא הַזְּמַן גְּרָמָא אֶלָּא <strong>חִיּוּב מִצְוָה זוֹ כָּךְ הוּא שֶׁיְּהֵא אָדָם מִתְחַנֵּן וּמִתְפַּלֵּל בְּכָל יוֹם וּמַגִּיד שִׁבְחוֹ שֶׁל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא וְאַחַר כָּךְ שׁוֹאֵל צְרָכָיו שֶׁהוּא צָרִיךְ לָהֶם בְּבַקָּשָׁה וּבִתְחִנָּה</strong> וְאַחַר כָּךְ נוֹתֵן שֶׁבַח וְהוֹדָיָה לַה׳‎ עַל הַטּוֹבָה שֶׁהִשְׁפִּיעַ לוֹ כָּל אֶחָד לְפִי כֹּחוֹ:</p>\n  \n  <p>The obligation in this precept is that <strong>every person should daily, according to his ability, offer up supplication and prayer</strong>; first uttering praises of God, then, <strong>with humble supplication and petition <em>ask for all that he needs</em></strong>, and finally offer praise and thanksgiving to the Eternal for the benefits already bestowed upon him in rich measure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>All that one needs</em> normally includes healthy sexual relations.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, it doesn't eliminate the general idea of prayer with proper intention (or as you seem to describe, with pure thoughts). So no, you shouldn't indulge in sexual fantasies during that request. That isn't prayer, it's indulging your Yetzer HaRah.</p>\n\n<p>And since it came up in the comments to your question, regular, proper, sexual relations with ones spouse are not only for procreation, nor limited to pleasure as you pointed out. But as Rambam states in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot De'ot 3:2</a>, it is also part of a normal, healthy regimen.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כְּדֵי <strong>שֶׁיַּבְרִיא וְיַעֲמֹד שָׁלֵם הוֹאִיל</strong> וְאִי אֶפְשָׁר לָאָדָם לִחְיוֹת אֶלָּא בַּאֲכִילָה וּשְׁתִיָּה. <strong>וְכֵן כְּשֶׁיִּבְעל לֹא יִבְעל אֶלָּא כְּדֵי לְהַבְרוֹת גּוּפוֹ וּכְדֵי לְקַיֵּם אֶת הַזֶּרַע.</strong> לְפִיכָךְ אֵינוֹ בּוֹעֵל כָּל זְמַן שֶׁיִּתְאַוֶּה אֶלָּא כָּל עֵת שֶׁיֵּדַע שֶׁהוּא צָרִיךְ לְהוֹצִיא שִׁכְבַת זֶרַע כְּמוֹ דֶּרֶךְ הָרְפוּאָה אוֹ לְקַיֵּם אֶת הַזֶּרַע:</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>that he may become healthy and stay healthy,</strong> seeing that it is impossible for man to sustain life save by food and drink. <strong>Likewise in connubial relation there shall be no coition save when it is of benefit to health, or to sustain species.</strong> One should, therefore, not yield to every urge, save when knowing that emission of semen is a helpful means medically or to sustain species.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding your question about such prayer while wearing tefillin, among other aspects of tefillin is that it is part of the emphasis of translating ones thoughts and emotions into realized literal, physical, material action. Or in the words <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.17?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel of Mishnah Avot 1:17</a>, <strong><em>the action is the primary thing</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>שִׁמְעוֹן בְּנוֹ אוֹמֵר</strong>, כָּל יָמַי גָּדַלְתִּי בֵין הַחֲכָמִים, וְלֹא מָצָאתִי לַגּוּף טוֹב אֶלָּא שְׁתִיקָה. <strong>וְלֹא הַמִּדְרָשׁ הוּא הָעִקָּר, אֶלָּא הַמַּעֲשֶׂה</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So no, if praying in the context described above, it would not be a problem to make such a prayer while wearing tefillin.</p>\n\n\n",

It does not seem to be at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29397/why-did-miriam-die-in-the-desert\">Why did Miriam die in the desert?</a> or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/57251/what-do-we-learn-from-miriams-demise-being-juxtaposed-to-the-red-heifer\">What do we learn from Miriam's demise being juxtaposed to the Red Heifer?</a>, although the former does link to a torah.org commentary that makes essentially the same point -- but without any  sources. I am 99% sure I encountered it in one of the meforshim, but I can't find it in Rashi or Ramban, which pretty much exhausts my textual skills.  Can anybody help me track it down?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps rav Samson Raphael Hirsch (ibid):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nicht umsonst aber geht wohl diesem Kapitel, das so kurz und schmucklos den Tod der Geschwister Mirjam und Aharon enthält, das große פרה אדומה-Kapitel der jüdischen Unsterblichkeitslehre voran. Dieses Kapitel selbst ist eine große Einleitung zu diesen Toten und sagt: Was in Mirjam Mirjam, was in Aharon Aharon war, das ist mit ihrem Tode nicht gestorben, wie ihr Wirken hienieden in allen Folgegeschlechtern ihrer Nation unsterblich fortlebt, so ist ihr eigenstes Wesen selbst aus irdischer Vergänglichkeit zu Gott, dem Urquell alles Lebens in die Ewigkeit zurückgekehrt. Und wenn das Wort der Weisen (Mo'ed Katan 28a) lehrt: למה נסמכה מיתת מרים לפרשת פרה אדומה לומר לך מה פרה אדומה מכפרת אף מיתתן של צדיקים מכפרת, daß die Zusammenordnung dieser beiden Kapitel lehre, dem Tode der Gerechten wohnt eben eine solche sühnende Kraft inne, wie dem חטאת־פרה אדומה, so möchte dies wohl auch in diesem Sinne eine Wahrheit sein, daß, wie die פרה אדומה-Institution die Unsterblichkeit und damit die sittliche Freiheit des göttlichen Menschenwesens lehrt, so lehrt beides unmittelbar auch der Tod des Gerechten. Denn wahrlich, der muss geistig blind sein, dem das Sterben eines Gerechten nicht zur lautesten Unsterblichkeitspredigt wird, der in dem, was nun reglos und Verwesungsspuren tragend vor ihm liegt, das noch zu erblicken wagt, was noch soeben in so geistiger Kraft und in sittlich freier Macht Denken und Wollen betätigte, der in der Leiche des Gerechten etwas anderes erblicken kann, als den in den Winkel geworfenen Mantel eines von dannen geschiedenen Mannes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not for nothing is this chapter, which so briefly and unadornedly describes the death of the siblings Miriam and Aharon, preceded by the great פרה אדומה chapter of the Jewish doctrine of immortality. This chapter itself is a great introduction to these dead and says: What in Miriam was Miriam, what in Aharon was Aharon, that did not die with their death, as their work lives on immortally in all subsequent generations of their people, so their very being has returned from earthly transience to God, the original source of all life, into eternity. And as the word of the sages (Mo'ed Katan 28a) teaches: למה נסמכה מיתת מרים לפרשת פרה אדומה לומר לך מה פרה אדומה מכפרת אף מיתתן של צדיקים מכפרת, That the connection of these two chapters teaches that the death of the righteous has just such an atoning power inherent in it, as the חטאת-פרה אדומה, so that this may also be a truth in this sense, that Just as the פרה אדומה institution teaches the immortality and thus the moral freedom of the divine man, so the death of the righteous directly teaches both. For truly, he must be spiritually blind to whom the death of a righteous man does not become the loudest sermon of immortality, who still dares to see in what now lies motionless and bearing traces of decay before him that which just a moment ago actuated thought and will in such spiritual strength and in morally free power, than the coat of a deceased man tossed into the corner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My own translation)</p>\n\n\n",

That one idea seems perplexing to me. Maybe some things were simply lost in the English translation of the original Biblical Hebrew which makes it somewhat questionable how one could come up with the idea that getting a close to hairless jaw (safe some stubbles that can't be removed with scissors effectively) is not 'destroying' the beard.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You ascertained:<br/>\n<em>How did our Sages come up with the halacha (or rather idea) that using scissors (or appliances that do not cut the root like most electric shavers) does not constitute 'destroying the corner of the beard'?</em></p>\n\n<p>And you said the source was:<br/>\n<em>Leviticus 19:27 states, \"You shall not round off the side-growth on your head, or destroy the side-growth of your beard.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>And that's the answer. Look carefully: the Torah uses different language for the <em>sideburns</em> than for the beard.</p>\n\n<p>By analyzing the language difference carefully, the Sages of the Talmud figured out that razors and scissors are forbidden for the <em>sideburns</em> and only razors for the beard.</p>\n\n<p>For the source see the Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Makkot.21a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Makos 21</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It would seem to depend on whether one is of the opinion that <em>gilu’ach</em> (\"shaving\") & <em>hashchasah</em> (\"destroying the hair\") are prohibited regardless of the device used (ie scissors would be <strong>forbidden</strong>)<br />\n<strong>OR</strong>   whether one is of the opinion <em>gilu’ach</em> & <em>hashchasah</em> <strong>ONLY</strong> applies to a razor (ie scissors would be <strong>permitted</strong>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There's a great <strong>OUKosher</strong> article titled \"<a href=\"https://oukosher.org/halacha-yomis/may-electric-shavers-used-shave-ones-beard/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">May electric shavers be used to shave one’s beard?</a>\" which addresses your question, by first understanding the nature of the prohibition:</p>\n<h2>a) Shavers/ scissors are PROHIBITED</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are many Gedolei HaPoskim, past and present, who have declared that shavers are prohibited in the same manner as razors [<a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/Default.aspx?HalachaID=2355\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> says the <strong>Chofetz Chaim</strong> was of this opinion]. The reason for this view is that the Torah does not prohibit a particular shaving device, but rather prohibits the act of shaving (\"<em>gilu’ach</em>\") and destroying the hair  (\"<em>hashchasah</em>\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>b) Shavers/ scissors are ALLOWED</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The other view amongst the Poskim maintains that <strong>only</strong> the gilu’ach and hashchasah <strong>of a razor</strong> is prohibited by the Torah. <strong>They understand that Chazal identified the razor as the only tool to which the prohibition applies</strong>. According to this view, <strong>there is a fundamental difference between a razor and scissors in the way the hair is cut</strong>. A razor cuts the hair directly, due to the sharpness of the blade. <strong>Scissors operate in an entirely different manner, squeezing the hair between two opposing blades.</strong> <strong>The hair is cut by virtue of the pressure applied to it, and not due to the sharpness of the blade.</strong> Consequently, the <strong>Poskim who allow the use of shavers maintain that scissors may be used, even if the resulting trim is exactly the same as that of a razor</strong> (misparayim k’ein ta’ar). Most (mechanical) shavers consist of a set of tiny opposing blades or surfaces that cut the hair in the manner of scissors. According to this second viewpoint, nearly all shavers are permissible under the rule of misparayim k’ein ta’ar.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Practically speaking</h3>\n<p>The article concludes by noting that the <strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.181.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 181:10</a> rules like the second view (ie that that scissors are allowed) and also cites the view of <strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein zt”l</strong>, who also differentiated between the cutting action of scissors and that of a razor, thus permitting the use of most electric shavers.</p>\n\n\n",

However, Kemach Brand Corn Flakes is made from corn flour; therefore, its brocha is Shehakol.  The same is true regarding Corn Chex; therefore, the brocha is Shehakol.<sup>21</sup></p>\n<p>If a corn flake cereal is not on the brochos list, how can one tell if\nthe brocha is Hoadama or Shehakol?  If the cereal lists corn flour,\nthe corn has been ground and reformed into pellets so the brocha is\nShehakol (if wheat and oat flour are not present). If the cereal lists\ncorn or milled corn, it may be a whole grain product and the brocha is\nHoadama, or it may be ground and the brocha is Shehakol.  To determine\nthe brocha, one must look carefully at various flakes.  If they have\njagged edges, the surface of the flake is bumpy, it comes from a\ngrit<sup>22</sup> and the brocha is Hoadama.  If the corn flakes are relatively\nsmooth (very small bumps), and the edges are smoother, the corn flakes\nare from a more uniform pellet (made from corn flour) and the brocha\nis Shehakol.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4YppY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4YppY.jpg\" alt=\"Star-K corn flake shape comparison\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>The corn flake on the left is Shehakol because it is made from flour\nthat is reshaped into uniform pellets.

    "title": "Can a Judge Issue a Ruling After his Death?",
    "content": "# Can a Judge Issue a Ruling After his Death?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a recent decision (No. 18-272, <em>Yovino v. Rizo</em>, decided February 25, 2019 <em>Per Curiam</em>, properly cited as <em>586 U. S. ___ (2019)</em>), the United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) dealt with the matter of a judge in a court of appeals that had participated in a case, voted on one side of an <em>en banc</em> review, and authored the 6-5 majority opinion.  However, he died 11 days before the ruling was officially issued.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed that decision to stand, stating:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Prior to his death, Judge Reinhardt fully participated in this case and\n    authored this opinion.  The  majority opinion and all concurrences were\n    final, and voting was completed by the en banc court prior to his death.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the Court vacated and remanded, taking the position that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in this case, Judge Reinhardt\n  was neither an active judge nor a senior judge.  For that reason, by\n  statute he was without power to participate in the en banc court’s decision\n  at the time it was rendered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And therefore,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... [T]he Ninth Circuit erred in counting him as a member of the majority.\n  That practice effectively allowed a deceased judge to exercise the judicial\n  power of the United States after his death.  But federal judges are\n  appointed for life, not for eternity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The details and quotes are from the decision, available on the SCOTUS website.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's my question: If such a scenario took place in a <em>Beis Din</em>, that one of the <em>dayanim</em> died after writing the ruling but before the <em>p'sak</em> was formally published, what would be the <em>halacha</em>?  Is there a specific point in the process, some part of <em>g'mar din</em>, where it might matter before but not afterwards?  Does it make a differenct whether the other <em>dayanim</em> agree, thus nullifying the question of the majority?  (This is mentioned as relevant in the SCOTUS case.)  Or perhaps the ruling is now seen as being issued by only two <em>dayanim</em>, which do not form a proper <em>Beis Din</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Would the rules change depending on the sort of <em>beis din</em>?  That is, would the same principle hold for a <em>Sandhedrin Ketana</em> of 23, ruling on capital punishment, and today's <em>Batei Din</em>, which are (technically) <em>hedyotos</em>, without proper <em>semicha</em>?</p>\n\n<p>As this is primarily a discussion post, sources where such questions have been raised and answered would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Mishna in Sanhedrin 5/4 writes (copied from Sefaria)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר אֶחָד מִן הַתַּלְמִידִים יֶשׁ לִי לְלַמֵּד עָלָיו זְכוּת, מַעֲלִין אוֹתוֹ וּמוֹשִׁיבִין אוֹתוֹ בֵינֵיהֶן, וְלֹא הָיָה יוֹרֵד מִשָּׁם כָּל הַיּוֹם כֻּלּוֹ. אִם יֵשׁ מַמָּשׁ בִּדְבָרָיו, שׁוֹמְעִין לוֹ.</p>\n<p>If one of the disciples (sitting in front of Sanhedrin) said, “I have something to argue in favor of his acquittal”, they bring him up and set him among them and he does not come down from there all day. If there is anything of substance in his words they listen to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in Sanhedrin 34a writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ש דאמר ר' יוסי בר חנינא אחד מן התלמידים שזיכה ומת רואין אותו כאילו חי ועומד במקומו ואמאי נימא אילו הוה קיים הדר ביה השתא מיהא לא הדר ביה</p>\n<p>The Gemara suggests: Come and hear a proof from a baraita: As Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: In a case where there was one of the students who argued to acquit and then died, the court views him as if he were alive and standing in his place and voting to acquit. The Gemara asks: But why? According to the opinion of Rav, that a judge may change his opinion at the time of the verdict, let us say: Perhaps if that student were alive, he would retract his opinion and find the accused liable. The Gemara explains: Now, in any event, he did not retract from his opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The assumption is that he would not have changed his opinion, although one can do so.</p>\n<p>The Rambam in Sanhedrin 10,3 rules like this Gemara.</p>\n<p>[The Aruch La'ner (Sanhedrin 34a S.V. אחד) write that the chidush here is that even by a student who is not a regular member of Sanhedrin we follow his stated opinion. By a regular member of the Sanhedrin, we definitely follow his stated opinion.]</p>\n<p>The Aruch Ha'Shulchan writes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.18.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria Here</a> that this is said specifically when we are saving the defendant from capital punishment, because of the rule of והצילו העדה that we try to save the defendant from death. However, where the judge was inclined to have him killed, or by monetary cases, where והצילו העדה would not apply, we do suspect that the judge changed his mind before the Gemar Din.</p>\n\n\n",

(<em>I base it on the fact that in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meggilot Qumran</a>, for example, they were all found mixed and not separated by holiness or even language.</em>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does it mean that a book was decided to be or not a part of the Nac\"h?</strong> Does it have special qualities that others don't? </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>NB: I see a similar pattern in the oral Law, that after the Mishnah was cannonized and signed, a lot of Beraitos were left out but still largely used in Talmudic discussions. However, in the written Torahm the external book practically vanished from our bookshelves.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To answer your question first requires understanding what the English word, <em>canonization</em> means and its root, <em>canon</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It's actually from the Latin and is generally associated with the Catholic Church. To canonize, the verb form, has essentially three meanings all of which relate to consensus of agreement.</p>\n\n<p>1) It is a process of forming a consensus to declare some individual to be a Saint, or in Hebrew, <em>Tzaddik</em>, completely righteous.</p>\n\n<p>2) Forming consensus agreement that something is beyond reproach and significant in all circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>3) In terms of literature, consensus agreement that a given text is accepted by all as authoritative, both in terms of its content and its author and can be used in terms of determining correct behavior in all generations and situations.</p>\n\n<p>The root noun, <em>canon</em>, also has an implication of general laws or rules.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, it would mean that those texts which form the <em>canon</em> are accepted by all as authoritative, their authors are deemed by consensus to have been Tzaddikim, and that they apply in all circumstances and times, and can be used to derive and determine halacha and general, proper behavior.</p>\n\n<p>This subject is discussed in detail by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan in volume one of the Handbook of Jewish Thought. In regard to the criteria of what got included in the Tanach, he first points to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.14a.10-11?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 14a</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותו ליכא והכתיב (שמואל א א, א) ויהי איש אחד מן הרמתים צופים אחד ממאתים צופים שנתנבאו להם לישראל מיהוה טובא הוו כדתניא הרבה נביאים עמדו להם לישראל כפלים כיוצאי מצרים <strong>אלא נבואה שהוצרכה לדורות נכתבה ושלא הוצרכה לא נכתבה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those prophecies that were required for all the generations were <em>written</em>, meaning included in the Tanach. Those that were not necessary for all future generations were not included.</p>\n\n<p>And this is also what is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.21.2?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah, Chapter 21</a>, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אלו מ\"ח נביאים וז' נביאות שנתנבאו להן לישראל ונכתבו בכתובים</strong>, <strong>ויש נביאים כיוצאי מצרים ולא נכתבו</strong>, יכול מפני שהן מועטין, תלמוד לומר וחמשים איש מבני הנביאים הלכו וגו' (מלכים ב ב ז), <strong>יכול מפני שהן הדיוטות,</strong> תלמוד לומר ויאמרו אליו <strong>הידעת כי היום ה' לקח את אדניך מעל ראשך</strong> וגו' (שם ב ג), אדונינו אין כתוב כאן, אלא אדניך, <strong>מלמד שכולן גדולים כאליהו, ושקולים כאלישע</strong>, וכן משה אמר מי יתן והיה לבבם זה להם (דברים ה כו), ואומר ומי יתן כל עם ה' נביאים כי יתן ה' את רוחו עליהם (במדבר יא כט), ועבדיה אמר לאליהו הלא הגד לאדני את אשר עשיתי בהרג איזבל את נביאי ה' ואחבא מנביאי ה' מאה איש וגו' (מלכים א יח יג), חוץ מה שהיו ביהודה ובנימן, ואליהו אמר לאלישע שב נא פה כי ה' שלחני עד בית אל וגו', ויצאו בני הנביאים אשר בית אל וגו' (מלכים ב ב), שוב אמר לאלישע שב נא פה כי ה' שלחני יריחו וגו', ויגשו בני הנביאים אשר ביריחו וגו' (שם), שוב אמר לו שב נא פה כי ה' שלחני הירדנה וגו', וחמשים איש מבני הנביאים הלכו וגו' (שם), <strong>שאין לך כל עיר ועיר בארץ ישראל, שלא היו בה נביאים</strong>, <strong>אלא כל נבואה שהיתה לצורך הדורות נכתבה, לצורך שעה לא נכתבה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It asks if those other Tzaddikim were somehow of a lesser status than those which were included in the Tanach and answers, <strong><em>No. They were all as great as Eliyahu HaNavi and of equal value as Elisha HaNavi.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>And a similar sentiment is expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth_Rabbah%2C_Petichta?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Ruth Rabbah 1:2</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּכְתִיב (מלכים ב ב, ג): וַיֵּצְאוּ בְנֵי הַנְּבִיאִים אֲשֶׁר בֵּית אֵל אֶל אֱלִישָׁע, נְבִיאִים, אֵין נְבִיאִים פָּחוֹת מִשְּׁנַיִם, <strong>וּמִפְּנֵי מָה לֹא נִתְפַּרְסְמָה נְבוּאָתָם, שֶׁלֹא הָיָה בָּהּ צֹרֶךְ לְדוֹרוֹת. אֱמֹר מֵעַתָּה כָּל נְבוּאָה שֶׁאֵינָהּ צֹרֶךְ לְדוֹרוֹת לֹא נִתְפַּרְסְמָה, אֲבָל לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בָּא וּמְבִיאָן עִמּוֹ וְתִתְפַּרְסֵם נְבוּאָתָם,</strong> הֲדָא הוּא דִכְתִיב (זכריה יד, ה): וּבָא ה' אֱלֹהַי כָּל קְדשִׁים עִמָּךְ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This last quotation emphasizes that those books that were not included in the Tanach, even though they were not relevant to every generation, <strong><em>will be brought to the publics attention by G-d when they are needed.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>And as you mention, this was all done by the Anshei Knesset HaGadolah under the direction of Ezra like it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15a.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Bathra 15a</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ירמיה כתב ספרו וספר מלכים וקינות חזקיה וסיעתו כתבו (ימש\"ק סימן) ישעיה משלי שיר השירים וקהלת <strong>אנשי כנסת הגדולה כתבו (קנד\"ג סימן) יחזקאל ושנים עשר דניאל ומגילת אסתר עזרא כתב ספרו ויחס של דברי הימים</strong> עד לו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as Rashi points out there, those books that were not actually written down by the particular Prophet but by the Men of the Great Assembly and Ezra, were only composed that way because the writing of their prophecies was delayed until they were actually in the land of Israel. The prophecies had been received outside of the land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>And those twenty-four books of the Tanach are the complete transmission from G-d and there will not be any change or additional message from what is contained in those books. Only the explanation and understanding of their meaning will adjust according to the needs of the particular generation. This is like what is expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Hasidim.1016.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chassidim section 1016</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>לאחר שמתו נביאים האחרונים מכאן ואילך לא נתנה לעליונים רשות ולא לתחתונים להרבות פסוק אחד</strong> כיצד לעליונים המלאכים לא יוסיפו פסו' אחד כגון פליגי בה תרין מלאכי ברקיע <strong>לא יוסיפו לדבר שום פסוק שאינו מן המקרא.</strong> וכן התחתונים כגון אליהו <strong>הכל מעשרים וארבעה ספרים מפני שלאחר שפסקו הנביאים לא ניתן לכתוב פסוק אחד ולא אות אחת שנאמר אל תוסיף על דבריו לכך עשו מסורות מכ\"ד ספרים סך פעמים אותה תיבה בקרייה כי ידעו שאין להוסיף אות</strong> <strong>אחת</strong> ומה שכתוב הלא הם כתובים על דברי חוזה במדרש עידו. <strong>אנשי כנסת הגדולה אמרו מה שהוצרכו לדרוש כבר ואין נביא רשאי לחדש דבר על עשרי' וארבעה ספרים</strong> לא מלאך ולא אליהו <strong>אלא כל מה שעוסקים מלאכים וצדיקים בגן עדן רק בעשרים וארבעה ספרים ובתורה ושל בעל פה</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You refer in your question to <em>\"man-made books\"</em> that are excluded from the <em>Canon</em>, suggesting that they are somehow different.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe explains this idea in the sense that all the Sifrei Kodesh (ספרי קודש) of the Jewish people are communications from G-d to his Saints through the ages. This includes the books which you refer to as the <em>external books</em> (Like Ben Sirach, who was purported to be the son of Yirmiyahu HaNavi, Sefer Zerubavel, Sefer Chanoch, Sefer Raziel and many others). The primary difference being that those not in the Canon do not <strong><em>necessarily</em></strong> apply to all circumstances nor are <strong><em>necessarily</em></strong> relevant to all individuals.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't mean that they are false or corrupted or not from G-d. But only that they should be applied in the correct circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>And this is similar to the view expressed by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan in volume one of his Handbook of Jewish Thought, chapter 8:84 which he bases upon the Ritva in Ein Yaacov to Bava Bathra 98a, the Nimukey Yosef to Rif 48b on Bava Bathra, and the Eitz Yosef and Radal to Kohelet Rabbah 12:13.</p>\n\n<p>Although Rabbi Kaplan comments that those books were not composed with Ruach HaKodesh. It is worth pointing out that the Alter Rebbe is purported to have been of the view that <strong><em>all sifrei kodesh up to and including the generation of the Rishonim were composed with Ruach HaKodesh</em></strong>. An excellent discussion of this particular detail can be seen at <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%97_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9_(%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Wikipedia page on Ruach HaKodesh</a> and its meaning particularly in later generations.</p>\n\n<p>And this type of idea shouldn't come as a surprise. It is in keeping with the general principle we learn from Moshe Rabbeinu about <em>Klal</em> (General Principles) and <em>Prat</em> (Specific Concepts), like is emphasized in the parshiyot of VaYakhel and Pekudei at the end of sefer Shemot.

He tells her what he must do and instead of refusing to be subservient to his vow she says (36):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו אָבִי פָּצִיתָה אֶת־פִּיךָ אֶל־ה' עֲשֵׂה לִי כַּאֲשֶׁר יָצָא מִפִּיךָ אַחֲרֵי אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה לְךָ ה' נְקָמוֹת מֵאֹיְבֶיךָ מִבְּנֵי עַמּוֹן׃</p>\n<p>“Father,” she said, “you have uttered a vow to the LORD; do to me as you have vowed, seeing that the LORD has vindicated you against your enemies, the Ammonites.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the gemarah (Taanit 4a) Yiftach offered her as a sacrifice. Yet I would assume his daughter would be obligated under the command of וְחי בהם to do whatever is in her power not to be killed. But even according to the opinions (Radak, Ralbag etc.) who assume she was dedicated to God in a manner similar to Shmuel HaNavi, I don't see why the daughter would have to comply. Perhaps it is possible that she wanted to comply even without any true obligation to do so, but I have not seen any commentators who make this claim.</p>\n<p>Therefore my question is did Yiftach's daughter have to comply with his vow and if not, why did she?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Midrash Bereshis Rabba 60,3 says clearly that Yiftach's daughter did not need to comply as Yiftach's neder was not valid to bring his daughter as a sacrifice and therefore according to Reish Lakish Yiftach also was scot-free, and according to Rabbi Yochanan even though <em>she</em> wasn't a <em>Korban</em> at all and was free, <em>He</em> was obligated to bring her value in money just like any <em>Arachin</em> pledge someone makes on anyone else, <em>he</em> brings the value to the <em>Beis Hamikdash</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שופטים יא, לד): וַיָּבֹא יִפְתָּח וגו' וְהִנֵּה בִתּוֹ יֹצֵאת לִקְרָאתוֹ, רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן וְרֵישׁ לָקִישׁ, רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן אָמַר הֶקְדֵּשׁ דָּמִים הָיָה חַיָּב, וְרֵישׁ לָקִישׁ אָמַר אֲפִלּוּ הֶקְדֵּשׁ דָּמִים לֹא הָיָה חַיָּב, דִּתְנַן <strong>אָמַר עַל בְּהֵמָה טְמֵאָה וְעַל בַּעֲלַת מוּם הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ עוֹלָה, לֹא אָמַר כְּלוּם</strong>, אָמַר הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ לְעוֹלָה, יִמָּכְרוּ וְיָבִיא בִּדְמֵיהֶם עוֹלָה. וְלֹא הָיָה שָׁם פִּינְחָס שֶׁיַּתִּיר לוֹ אֶת נִדְרוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason why Yiftach's daughter was secluded for the rest of her life is because Yiftach didn't know the Halacha, and Pinchas (who knew the Halacha) didn't tell him that he was not obligated to keep his daughter secluded (rather just pay her value like Rabbi Yochanan or get away scot-free like Reish Lakish) as the Radak explains:</p>\n\n<p>ולא היה שם פנחס שיתיר לו נדרו כלומר שיאמר לו כי בדמים היה פטור</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>She did not have to comply and he had no right to kill her or to ruin her life in any way.\nAnd he should have thought about that possibility beforehand and not made such a promise.</p>\n\n<p>There are very clear limits as to how far one has to go to fulfil a parent's wish. In fact, Jewish law does not even obligate a person to spend any money for helping his/her parents, never mind ruining their lives for them.</p>\n\n<p>And a parent has no right to demand that.</p>\n\n<p>Doing so is abuse.</p>\n\n\n",

We say that Heaven only punishes from age 20!</p>\n<p>We could say that the rules of Heaven are that they punish a person based on his knowledge, whether [or not] he is an adult, and if a 9 year old minor is as knowledgeable as a 20 year old they punish him.</p>\n<p>And the proof is from Samuel the prophet, for Eli the priest wanted to punish him for ruling on a matter of law in the presence of his teacher, even though he was only 3 years old.</p>\n<p>We can further say that that which Heaven doesn't punish until age 20 is when there is a major decree and a nation is being judged as one. Then they count from 20 years and above and judge them based on the majority. Or in the future when Isaac advocates in defense of Israel then they will only mention from age 20 and above. But an individual person even younger than 13 can be punished by Heaven, and the same [applies] for good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Kallah.4.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kallah Rabasi 4:6</a>\nit mentions the fact that Er and Onan were punished by heavenly court, followed by the fact that children can reach lofty levels. The Nachlas Yaakov, a commentary printed on the side there in the Gemara, writes that the connection between the two points of the Brasisa, is to answer your question. The reason why these children were punished, is because if they were advanced enough to reach high levels, they are mature enough to be punished as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונ\"ל הא דמייתי האי דרשה הכא בא ליישב שלא תקשה היכא ילפינן מער שחייב מיתה הא ער ואונן קטנים היו וא\"כ ע\"כ לאו משום חטאן מתו דלאו בני עונשין נינהו מש\"ה מביא ראיה דקטנים מקבלין פני השכינה וא\"כ מסתברא דנענשו נמי כשיחטאו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This question was asked by many authorities. For example, the <strong>Chacham Tzvi</strong> § 49.</p>\n\n<p>He says that there are those that suggest it was because of their intellectual maturity. Even though they were minors, they were mentally responsible for their actions like an adult. The Dovev Mesharim ed. of the Chacham Tzvi points to the <strong>Sefer Chassidim</strong> (Makitzei Nirdamim ed., based on Italian manuscripts) § 217 who says this answer (you can also see a different version quoted in @Alex's answer).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קטן שחילל שבת אינו נהרג וקטן שהורה לפני רבו חייב מיתה כשמואל לעלי, אלא כשאמרה חנה (ש\"א א כז) אל הנער הזה התפללתי, הרי משמים מענישין קטן הואיל ודעתו כגדול כער ואונן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the Chacham Tzvi rejects this approach. Instead, he wants to limit the scope of this concept. He gives four approaches on how to limit it (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8751/1739\">see here for a summary</a>), as he is bothered how could someone commit crimes as a minor and not be punished in the world to come. However, three of them don't address Er and Onan. The one that does is that the concept that Heavenly punishment is only above twenty is that we <strong>sometimes</strong> see this to be true.</p>\n\n<p>Someone I found who tries to use the Chacham Tzvi's rejected approach is <strong>Rav Dovid Kronglass</strong> (former <em>Mashgiach</em> at Yeshivas Ner Yisroel) in <strong>Sichos Chochmah UMussar</strong> II § 50. He builds off the <strong>Chavos Yair</strong> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=857&st=&pgnum=186\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§ 166</a>, who explains this concept to only apply to \"<em>mitzvos sichliyos</em>\", intuitive <em>mitzvos</em>. Something someone can figure out on their own, they're punished for, even as a child. He gives the example of <em>machlokes</em>, where we see the babies of Korach and his assembly were punished. This is pointed out in various sources:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bamidbar Rabbah</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.18.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:4</a>; <strong>Midrash Tanchuma</strong> <em>Korach</em> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Korach.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§ 3</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כַּמָּה קָשָׁה הַמַּחֲלֹקֶת, שֶׁבֵּית דִּין שֶׁל מַעְלָה אֵין קוֹנְסִין אֶלָּא מִבֶּן עֶשְׂרִים שָׁנָה וָמַעְלָה, וּבֵית דִּין שֶׁל מַטָּה מִבֶּן שְׁלֹשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה. וּבְמַחֲלֻקְתּוֹ שֶׁל קֹרַח, תִּינוֹקוֹת בֶּן יוֹמָן נִשְׂרְפוּ וְנִבְלְעוּ בִּשְׁאוֹל תַּחְתִּית</p>\n  \n  <p>How harmful is dissension! An emissary of the court on high only imposes a penalty [on people] from the age of twenty years, while the court below [only imposes a penalty] from the age of thirteen years. In the case of Korah's dissension, however, one-day-old babies were burned and swallowed up in nethermost Sheol</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Machlokes</em> is intuitively negative. However, prohibitions that are <strong>explicit are equally punished by Heaven and Earth starting at the ages of 12/13</strong>. Rav Kronglass says the <strong>Chasam Sofer</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Responsa_Chatam_Sofer%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.155.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 155</a>) writes somewhat similar to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בשרה נאמר בת עשרים כבת ז' בלא חטא התם קודם מ\"ת הוה <strong>והכל אצלה כמצות שכליות וע\"ז נאמרו שיעורי' הללו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As well, Rav Kronglass points out that this explains why children died during the flood, and why children in Sedom were punished. Both those events involved <em>mitzvos sichliyos</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kronglass takes this differentiation and uses it to explain Er and Onan. He says that it can't be that their sin was part of the <em>mitzvos sichliyos</em>, so that means someone thirteen and above should be punished by Heaven. However, as you pointed out, they were even younger than that. He says that their intelligence was that of someone over the age of thirteen, so they were punished by Heaven by that standard.</p>\n\n\n",

Besides, as per various Gemmoros (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15a.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B\"B 15a</a>) Na\"ch wasn't written by the originators, but by much later generations.</p>\n\n<p>If the Torah includes everything, why do we need additional books? And if they are extra-Toranean what permission is there to write them down?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We have explicit statements in Nach itself that G-d commanded the writing of (at least certain) prophecies, for example Yirmiyah 30:2 and 36:2, and Yechezkel 43:11. It's hardly a stretch to say that other prophets were given similar instructions that may not have been recorded. (Consider, for example, Neviim Rishonim. Would you assume that Hashem told Yehoshua or Shmuel or Yirmiyah to just announce these histories publicly, or to write them down?)</p>\n\n<p>And sure, the Torah includes everything. But for that matter, the Aseres Hadibros include all 613 mitzvos. So why the need for the rest of the Torah? Yet Hashem knew that we need to have the \"voltage\" stepped down into something that can power our daily lives, \"translating\" the Aseres Hadibros into more down-to-earth terms. That relationship, then, roughly parallels the one between Torah and Nach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Torah includes all laws, and no later prophet could add to or change the laws given to Moses. However, other prophets received messages from G-d that they were called on to announce to the Jews, and some prophets and wise men wrote books that were considered necessary for Jews to study because of the wisdom they contained. These were later collected into Prophets and Writings (Nevi'im u'Ksuvim), but they are not as holy as the books of Moses (see the beginning of Chapter 4 of Maseches Megillah) and cannot teach new laws (see Bava Kamma 2b).</p>\n<p>SO in other words, #3 does not go into #1 but is a separate category.</p>\n\n\n",

Per this, it seems that there is no difference between originally-prophetic verses and originally-historical verses. Consider perhaps also that while prophetic works were always prophetic - not all were intended to be preserved for the generations (לדורות) (many such works that were probably not intended for the generations were mentioned in Divrei Hayamim), so even those prophetic passages that were preserved were elevated in a sense - from a \"one-time\" prophecy to an eternal one.</p>\n<p><strong>As a side-note</strong>, I heard in a class from <a href=\"https://independent.academia.edu/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Yossi Baruchi</a> (a lecturer in the Orot Yisrael institute (though that's not where I heard the class)) that there's some evidence that the author of Melachim<sup>1</sup> might have considered at least some of the historical texts to have also had some level of holiness, seeing as the \"splicing\" of the various texts was often not done in a smooth manner. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.11.26-27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:11:26-27</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, the son of a widow whose name was Zeruah, was in Solomon’s service; he raised his hand against the king. The circumstances under which he raised his hand against the king were as follows: Solomon built the Millo and repaired the breach of the city of his father, David.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's one sort of introduction to Yerov'am. Then it says in verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.11.28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">28</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And<sup>2</sup> Jeroboam was an able man, and when Solomon saw that the young man was a capable worker, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the House of Joseph. etc [continues to describe his meeting with Achiyah]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We find that Yerov'am is introduced twice, in two different parshiyot. In the first parshiya, it says that he was a man in the service of the king who decided to rebel against him for a certain political reason. In the second parshiya, it says that he was a capable man in the service of the king who one day went out and was stopped by Achiya, who told him he was destined to rule Yisrael.</p>\n<p>In the first parshiya, it seems that Yerov'am was just some random who decided to rebel for some random reason, while according to the second parshiya, he was pushed into rebelling by Achiya (via word of Hashem). The first parshiya is what we may call a \"historical\" parshiya, or even a \"royal\" parshiya (historical - written by an eyewitness, \"objective\" historian of the time; royal - written by the subjective royal scribes biased in favor of the king) while the second one is obviously a \"prophetic\" parshiya, as it describes both a tale featuring a prophetic and the spiritual circumstances that brought upon a certain even.</p>\n<p>The main point here is that the author of Melachim could have spliced together the two parshiyot, forming one parshiya, smoothly edited. It might have looked something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, the son of a widow whose name was Zeruah, was an able man, and when Solomon saw that the young man was a capable worker, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the House of Joseph. During that time Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem and the prophet Ahijah of Shiloh met him on the way. He had put on a new robe; and when the two were alone in the open country, Ahijah took hold of the new robe he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. “Take ten pieces,” he said to Jeroboam. “For thus said the LORD, the God of Israel: I am about to tear the kingdom out of Solomon’s hands, and I will give you ten tribes. [...]. Sometime later, he raised his hand against the king as he was commanded to by the LORD. And the circumstances under which he raised his hand against the king were as follows: Solomon built the Millo and repaired the breach of the city of his father, David.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet this is not the case. The prophet was evidently careful to preserve as much of each of the original texts as possible - perhaps because each was considered holy in his view.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Commonly believed to have been Yirmiyahu, though in Dr. Baruchi's opinion, Yirmiyahu only wrote the first version of the book. The book as we have it today was edited at least one more time by a student or students of Yirmiyahu during the exile (but in a manner more significant than just adding the ending of Yehoyachin being freed from prison).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> I changed the word in the translation that Sefaria used because it seems that this translation attempted to deal with the exact point I'm trying to make.</p>\n\n\n",

According to his understanding, nevu'ah is a glimpse of something that the brain can only comprehend by casting it in the familiar.</p>\n<p>According to the Ramban, nevu'ah is a message sent in metaphor because only Moshe could handle more direct contact. There is reason to say the metaphor is chosen by HQBH, not the navi.</p>\n<p>According to the Abravanel (on the end of Mishpatim) this is core to understanding their debate in Vayeira as well as on the Man in the Throne vision at Har Sinai.</p>\n<p>The Rambam has no problem saying that Avraham could only see the angels prophetically. Because to the Rambam, \"things\" seen prophectically are really there, even if not physical substance that can be seen with the eyes. However, he says the \"Man\" the elders see at Mount Sinai is a created entity, the Kavod Nivra, because G-d cannot be seen, even by prophetic \"vision\".</p>\n<p>Whereas to the Ramban, saying the angels came in a nevu'ah would mean that Hashem sent a message that included a vision of angels. Which would leave no one to heal Avraham, destroy the Cities of the Plains, or save Lot's family. He has to have the angels actually take the form of people. On the other hand, the Man in the Throne could be G-d Himself, since there is no theological problem with G-d sending the Elders a message in which He represents Himself as a person.</p>\n<p>If we take the Rambam's position, then, the whole thing is subjective, followed by a creative element. And even by the Ramban's position, the vision is Hashem's choice, but the idiom in which it is is expressed is still personal choice.</p>\n\n\n",

After the Mishna was signed, the Sages continued to use extra-Mishnaic sources forever (Toseftah,  Midrashim, etc). </p>\n\n<p>After the 24 books of the Tanach were finalized/canonized, does the Talmud (the Sages) include citations or references to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/texts/Apocrypha\" rel=\"noreferrer\">extra-Tanachic books</a> (<em>Ben Sirah, 1-2- Maccabees, Sefer Zerubavel, Sefer Chanoch, Sefer Raziel, and many others, thanks Yaacov Deane</em>)? Or none of them are mentioned, but the 24 books?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>As @TamirEvan stated in the comments, Ben-Sira appears a few times in the Talmud, for example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.100b.11?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 100b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The verse states: “All the days of the poor are terrible” (Proverbs 15:15). The book of ben Sira says: Also the nights are terrible, as then the poor person worries. The poor person’s roof is among the lowest roofs in the city, and in the elevation of the hills is his vineyard, at the highest point, as those are of the lowest quality and consequently the least expensive places for each. From the rain on the roofs of the entire city, water will flow down to his roof and dampen it, and the soil of his vineyard is eroded by the rain and swept down to other vineyards.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ketubot.110b.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 110b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The mishna taught: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that a pleasant residence tests the individual. The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the term tests in this context? The Gemara explains: This is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A change in one’s eating habits [veset] or in one’s place of residence is the start of intestinal disease. Similarly, it is written in Sefer Ben Sira: All the days of the poor are terrible. And yet there are Shabbatot and Festivals, when even the poor eat well. Once again, the Gemara answers: This is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A change in one’s eating habits or in one’s place of residence is the start of intestinal disease, and as a result the poor suffer even from a change for the better. Since the Gemara quoted from Sefer Ben Sira, it cites the rest of the passage concerning the terrible days of the poor. Ben Sira says: Even the nights of the poor are bad. His roof is at the low point of the roofs, i.e., his residence is at the lowest point in the city, and his vineyard is at the mountain peaks, at the highest point of the slope, which means that the rain of roofs washes down to his roof, and the soil of his vineyard to other vineyards, i.e., the rain washes away the soil in his vineyard and carries it away to the vineyards below.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In both places, it seems that the gemara used Ben-Sira as an \"asmachta\" (אסמכתא) much in the same way as it usually uses psukim from the Tanach. However, in other places, it says one should not read Ben-Sira.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/segal-moses-hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. M.

Rashi says it's from a certain \"megillah\" (scroll).

Levine wrote an essay attached to the end of the PDF of Rabbi Leiman's essay, in which he argues against Rabbi Leiman's conclusions).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/pageview/3489975\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jahrbuch IX, pg. 13-15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/ehrentreu-heinrich\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Chanoch (Heinrich) Ehrentreu</a> wrote that he thinks the verse from Yevamot 86b, brought by @moses in his answer, \"ושוטרים הרבים בראשיכם\", is from an apocryphal work, specifically, in his opinion, the original Hebrew version of Maccabees I, which he believes is the same work as the \"Megillat Beit Chashmonai\" <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21295&pgnum=793\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentioned in the Halachot Gedolot</a> as having been written by sages from Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai.<sup>1</sup> There are a number of other interesting interpretations of the verse. For example, Rabbi Amos Sofer in Sinai, vol. 98, thought it might be from one of the Dead Sea cults or perhaps the Essenes (which may or may not be the same group).</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>Another such mysterious verse is \"בצר אל יורה\" (\"do not issue decisions when distressed\") which is quoted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eruvin.65a.10?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%91%D7%A6%D7%A8%20%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 65a</a>.

Rabba bar Mari said to him: This matter is written in the Torah, repeated in the Prophets, <strong>and triplicated in the Writings</strong>, and we learned it in a mishna, and we learned it in a baraita. Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael” (Genesis 28:9). It is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him” (Judges 11:3). <strong>And it is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him (Book of Ben Sira 13:17).</strong> We learned it in a mishna (Kelim 12:2): All that is attached to that which is ritually impure is ritually impure; all that is attached to that which is ritually pure is ritually pure.

In the context of their conversation, Rabban Gameliel's sister quotes the new testament (Matthew 5:17, \"I have come not to abrogate the law...), and a verse that doesn't show up anywhere in the New Testament, \"may your light shine\".

Tarfon, who lived soon after the destruction of the second Beit Hamikdash, and was known for some extremely anti-christian Halachot (Shabbos 116a, R.

The Idumeans were forced to convert to Judaism, either by threats of exile, or threats of death, depending on the source.<br />\nIn <em>Eusebíus, Christianity, and Judaism</em> Harold W. Attridge claims that “there is a reason to think that Josephus’ account of their conversion is substantially accurate.... these were not isolated instances but that forced conversion was a national policy is clear from the fact that Alexander Jannaeus (ca 80 BCE) demolished the city of Pella in Moab, 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.'\" <em>Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We practiced the death penalty as prescribed in the Torah and allowed the Beis Din authority to kill \"unlawfully\" (עונשים שלא מן הדין).</p>\n<p>With time, the Israeli kingdoms and authorities were destroyed and we lived in exile (under other nations' control) for the last 2500 years, eventually becoming a very nonviolent and peaceful religion, minimizing and eventually canceling the death penalty and corporal punishment, forgetting the idea of cleansing the Holy Land or conquering others.</p>\n<p>However, in our times, we have witnessed the violent behavior of certain Jewish groups toward the Arabs or the State of Israel.</p>\n<p>Is there a mechanism that would constrain Judaism from developing into violent fanaticism?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>This is not a comparative religion question, this Q. is speculative, about possible ways of development of our tradition.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>By definition, little can. But we do have some protections in that Judaism places human life on such a high pedestal relative to other values. To explain.</p>\n\n<p>In today's world, a religion that preaches violence won't really enter the mainstream. What happens instead is a splinter emerges that emphasizes other texts and other interpretations. (Of course, when your mainstream is some 1.6bn people, that splinter group could still be bigger than the entire Jewish population.) Which means that there is no way for the mainstream interpretation to prevent violent fundamentalism -- that will just be part of what the fundamentalist group will reject.</p>\n\n<p>However, violent fundamentalism is more likely the more values the belief system teaches to have a higher priority than life itself. And in particular, more important than other peoples' lives.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר ישמעאל מנין שאם אמרו לו לאדם עבוד עבודת כוכבים ואל תהרג מנין שיעבוד ואל יהרג ת\"ל (ויקרא יח, ה) וחי בהם ולא שימות בהם\n  יכול אפילו בפרהסיא תלמוד לומר (ויקרא כב, לב) ולא תחללו את שם קדשי ונקדשתי</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yishmael said: From where [do we know] that if they tell a person to worship \"star worship\" [an idiom for idolatry in general] and you will not be killed, from where [do we know] that he should serve and not be killed?

It is taught, \"and do not desecrate My holy name [i.e. G-d's reputation among humanity], and I will be sanctified within the Children of Israel.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>- <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.74a.14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the discussion continues, dying for the cause is only prescribed in limited cases:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Three \"cardinal\" sins: murder, public idolatry and certain kinds of sexual immorality. (By men. Women, for whom sex can be a passive experience, are not required to risk their lives to avoid sex even if required to be actively engaged. The activity is considered incidental to the core prohibition.)</li>\n<li>In times of religious persecution, one is <em>permitted</em> to sacrifice one's own life rather than accede a demand to violate any iota of Judaism. Even a difference in fashion, the textbook case being where Jews wore a different color shoelace than non-Jews.</li>\n<li>War.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The application of this short list to anyone else's death is a wholly different matter.</p>\n\n<p>The author of the Shulchan Arukh condemned the \"slaughtering rabbi\" who ruled during the Inquisition that it was preferable to kill children rather than let them be converted and raised in Catholic homes.</p>\n\n<p>So, of the three, it's really only war that opens the door to placing another Jewish value ahead of someone else's life. And so we can shift the question to exploring when war is permitted or even mandatory.</p>\n\n<p>Wars that are permitted in the Torah but not mandatory would require:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>an annointed king, something we won't have until the messiah assumes the throne;</li>\n<li>confirmation by a prophet and</li>\n<li>by the urim vetumim in the kohein gadol's vestments</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In a practical sense, that's off the table. In terms of Jewish Values an extremist might extrapolate from, it seems clear from Rashi (on Devarim 12:10-11) that these wars were to secure the settlement. Not an actual defensive war -- fighting in those falls under mandatory, and we're talking permitted but non-mandatory warfare. So, the rationale is lives now vs more lives later. Still, life as the primary value.</p>\n\n<p>Mandatory wars include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>defensive wars, which has the same life vs life rationale;</li>\n<li>the commandment that any member of Amaleiq must be killed or converted to at least Noachidism; and</li>\n<li>the commandment to take the land of Israel from the 7 Canaanite nations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As Amaleiq and the Canaanites were forcibly assimilated in the late First Temple period, your violent fundamentalist group would have to invent a rationale for that law that would apply to contemporary people, AND they would have to believe that the law itself is extended, in order to override \"thou shalt not murder\".</p>\n\n<p>As I said, we left the potentially violent very little to work with. A religion that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hillel summed up</a> as \"That which you loathe, do not do to another. That is all of the Torah, the rest is commentary. Now go study!\" (with similar summaries by Rabbi Aqiva and Ben Azzai) is very hard to turn into a justification for violence. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I heard a nice <em>vort</em> that directly addresses your question but might or might not satisfy you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 20:15</a> says the whole people <strong>saw</strong> the <strong>voices</strong> (וְכָל־הָעָם֩ רֹאִ֨ים אֶת־הַקּוֹלֹ֜ת).

Why did the Torah had to write this?</p>\n\n<p>Because <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two verses earlier</a>, the sixth commandment reads לֹ֥֖א תִּֿרְצָֽ֖ח. Now if you hear this, you do not know if it is <em>lo tirzach</em> with an <em>alef</em> or with a <em>vav</em>. With an <em>alef</em> it means \"do not kill\". With a <em>vav</em> it reads \"for him you should kill\", or \"in his name, you should kill\".</p>\n\n<p>For us to be sure the Torah meant \"do not kill\", we had to <strong>see the voice</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>(for a more traditional set of interpretations, see <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/and-all-people-saw-sounds\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

As such, once a person has been found guilty at a level which necessitates execution, you can be assured that according to the Torah, he really absolutely deserved it. Hence there is no room for being even more lenient.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, say there is someone going around raping young girls and nothing can be done to stop him. The Beit Din should be able to punish him severely in order to prevent more rapes.\n(Again, why a person who raped a little girl or any unmarried woman wouldn't be sentenced to death by the Torah while a person who lit a fire on Shabbat was is totally beyond me. As is much of the Torah's attitude towards rape of young girls.)</p>\n\n\n",

How do other commentators (Rishonim and Aḥaronim) approach this issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the versions of Gemara and commentators' texts which we have contain plenty of copying errors.</p>\n\n<p>Before there were printing presses, texts were copied by hand. Then then copy was copied by hand, then the copy of the copy, and so on. It is estimated that on average, <em>4-6 significant mistakes were made per page by each copier</em>. This went on for many generations, so multiply 4-6 by the distance of a copy from the original text (i.e. copy of a copy of a copy of a copy etc...) in order to gauge the average number of mistakes per page in it. It is enormous!</p>\n\n<p>One such mistake could be even the omission of 20 or so lines because 2 lines began with the same words (a common occurence, since often phrases relating to a certain topic are repeated several times in discussions about it). Examples of critical mistakes are the omission of 'לא' in 'לא מותר' or 'לא אסור' and omissions which give the text the opposite meaning of that originally written. Omissions of words and/or lines can also make text difficult to understand properly.</p>\n\n<p>Some mistakes in the Gemara are easy to identify, for example use of וישאו instead of ויסעו (or the other way round - I don't remember) when quoting a verse from the Torah. Others are hard or even impossible to identify. Some mistakes can only be identified by someone who has an extensive knowledge of all known quotations of the particular text, who can then deduce from that the differenet versions available to different commentators and can possibly gain insight into which version was the original.</p>\n\n<p>Such mistakes are also prevalent in the works of Rishonim, making some of their writings difficult or impossible to understand correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Due to scarcity of resources and time taken to write by hand, abbreviations were often used. Some of the people who copied texts expanded abbreviations, although not necessarily correctly. A famous exampke of that is where Rashi is quoted as saying 'הלכה היא בידוע שעשו שונא ליעקב', which seems strange since it cannot be considered a 'הלכה'. In fact, it had originally been 'הלא הוא בידוע' (Is it not known...) but the word הלא had been written in short as הל' and later expanded to הלכה in error.\n(Often the scribes who copied the text didn't necessarily understand it. They weren't necessarily all scholars...)</p>\n\n<p>Some people have worked hard to rectify such problems, with the most notable and most reliable example being the work of Machon Ma'arava (unrelated to Yeshivat Ma'arava) on the Ramban's commentary of Gemara (the dark green books). Machon Ma'arava went to great lengths to get hold of all known existing manuscripts of that, some of which are hidden away in prominent historic libraries and may not even be viewed without special permission and may not be photographed, but negotiations were made for microfilm copies. They then compared all known versions of the Ramban, literally letter by letter. A group of extremely knowledgeable scholars spent more than 10 years figuring out the correct versions, studying each sentence extensively in order to work out the correct version. Still, all versions were maintained in the text, with the seemingly correct version being put in square brackets and other versions put in smaller text and in round brackets. Thousands of such instances appear in the text.\n(Machon Ma'arava also inserted punctuations and sources into the text, and divided it into paragraphs for easier learning. Each punctuation mark was extensively deliberated, with sometimes many hours spent on decisions regarding one comma...)</p>\n\n<p>Hence it is no surprise that the Gemara seems to quotes verses which do not appear in the Torah. There are many such instances.</p>\n\n\n",

It says (my notes in brackets):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From where do we learn that the little Sanhedrin should be made up of twenty three? As it says, “The assembly shall judge”, “The assembly shall deliver” (Num. 35:24-25), an assembly that judges and an assembly that delivers, thus we have twenty. [Discussion of how we know an assembly is 10.]  And from where do we learn that we should bring three others [to the twenty]? By inference from what it says, “You shall not follow after the many to do evil” (Ex. 23:2), I conclude that I must be with them to do well. [Discussion about needing a majority of two to convict but only one to acquit.] The court must not be divisible equally, therefore they add to them one more; thus they are twenty three. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: we start with 20, and we have to add to get an odd number, and we get a side discussion of needing a majority of two to convict -- but I don't see how that adds up to <strong>23</strong> when they could just add one judge to get to <strong>21</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like the interpretation hinges on \"by inference from 'you shall not follow after the many to do evil'\", but since there are already \"many\" (well, 20), I don't see how to read that as \"add three more\".  I didn't find clarification in the <em>g'mara</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What is the <em>mishna's</em> logic for adding three judges to the two assemblies of ten?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>My understanding of the Mishnah is as follows:</p>\n<p>The court must contain at least 20 members because the court must be able to <em>simultaneously</em> contain an \"assembly\" of convicters and an \"assembly\" of pardoners. If it didn't need to have the potential for both simultaneously then we shouldn't need 20 to begin with – e.g. a court of 15 can still put forth an \"assembly\" of convicters or an \"assembly\" of pardoners (such as if the votes are split 10-5).</p>\n<p>The Mishnah then adds a twist to this by telling us that even though an \"assembly\" is technically 10 people, in order for the convicters to win they have to outnumber the pardoners by at least two. Therefore, we need to add two more judges. We can't take these two judges from the existing judges because then there is no possibility of having simultaneous \"assemblies\" of convicters and pardoners (which if unnecessary should mean that we never need 20 judges to begin with).</p>\n<p>However, now that there are 22 judges it leaves the possibility of an evenly split court, which we can't have. We can't take away one judge, because then we would be one short either for the \"assembly\" of convicters or the \"assembly\" of pardoners. Therefore we have to add yet another judge, bringing the total to 23.</p>\n<p>Note also that Rambam when codifying this law states that it's more of a tradition than actually based on the cited verses:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=14271\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Hilchot Sanhedrin 5:3</strong></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומניין שאין דנין דיני נפשות אלא בעשרים ושלשה אע\"פ שדברי קבלה הן הרי הוא אומר ושפטו העדה והצילו העדה עדה שופטת ועדה מצלת עדה שופטת והן המחייבין ועדה מצלת והן המזכין ואין עדה פחות מעשרה הרי עשרים ומוסיפין שלשה כדי שלא יהא בית דין שקול ויהיה בו אחרי רבים להטות</p>\n<p>What is the source which teaches that capital cases may be judged only by a court of 23? <strong>Although this is a matter conveyed by the Oral Tradition, there is an allusion to it in the Torah.</strong> Numbers 35:24-25 states: \"And the congregation shall judge... and the congregation shall save....\" Implied is that there must be the possibility of a congregation judging - and condemning him to death - and a congregation saving - and seeking his acquittal. Now a congregation is no less than ten. Thus there are at least 20 judges. We add three judges so that there not be an equally balanced court and to allow the possibility of \"following after the inclination of the majority.\"</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1172728/jewish/Sanhedrin-vehaOnashin-haMesurin-lahem-Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I know that the Orthodox do not consider me to be Jewish as I am a Reform convert, but my wife and daughter are Jews through matrilineal descent. I don't typically out myself as a convert unless I am directly asked or there is a reason I have to.</p>\n\n<p>Is a Reform convert permitted to participate in Chabad programming (Shabbat meals, learner's minyan, torah study etc.)? If so, is there anything the convert is required to disclose to the Chabad Rabbi?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Chabad rabbis I've met go out of their way to welcome people in.  They also have to know that for the Reform movement in particular with their stance on patrilineal descent, there is a non-trivial chance of issues with the <em>halachic</em> status of non-Orthodox Jews.  I'm a member of a Reform congregation and when I had to make last-minute <em>seder</em> plans one year, the Chabad rabbi didn't ask any questions when I asked to attend their community <em>seder</em>.  I was far from the only person there who was not from within the Chabad community.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know how they handle honors for men; as a woman I'm not going to be offered an <em>aliyah</em> or be counted in a <em>minyan</em> anyway, so any questions about my status don't matter there.  A man who is offered an honor can and should decline. If there is only barely a <em>minyan</em>, a man should tell whoever's running things (it might not be the rabbi) not to count him.  Unless the person asks why not, there's no need to say anything more.</p>\n\n<p>As for attending classes, a Reform <em>ger</em> should take cues from how they publicize the class.  Another answer says non-Jews can't learn torah, but I note that several Orthodox rabbis (from across the spectrum) have taught at Pittsburgh's community-wide <em>tikkun leil Shavuot</em> for the last ten years, so the issue seems more nuanced.  If the Chabad rabbi offers (and advertises) a class to the whole community, as our local Chabad rabbi does for JLI classes, then anyone in the community can show up -- either that rabbi doesn't hold by the \"no torah study\" rule <em>or</em> he has chosen the class content with the possibility of a broad audience.</p>\n\n<p>If you find yourself attending more than a handful of their events, it would be a good idea to let the rabbi know your status.  He might even respond by offering to teach you! </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Someone who is not Jewish is not permitted to learn Torah or keep Shabbos. (There is no issue, of course, in partaking of Shabbos meals.)</p>\n\n<p>The answer to the specific question may depend on future plans. The laws of a Reform convert and the laws of an Orthodox-convert-in-training differ. If one plans on a halachic (Orthodox) conversion to Judaism imminently, certain elements of Torah study prohibited to a non-Jew may be permitted for a convert-in-training.</p>\n\n<p>As far as partaking of the Shabbos meals - <em>if</em> the Chabad organization are only sponsoring it for Jews, and <em>if</em> they would not allow non-Jews to participate, then partaking under false pretenses could be considered paramount to stealing. (In all likelihood, this is irrelevant; Chabad are generally welcoming and all inclusive, and are unlikely to differentiate between a Reform convert and a Jew as far as Shabbat meals are concerned)</p>\n\n<p>One who is not an Orthodox Jew should also make sure not to touch any wine that is not <em>mevushal</em>, which would invalidate it for any Jews present at the meal.</p>\n\n\n",

In a case of a cloth that was not considered a keli until it is a finished curtain, Bais Shammai would say its a keli with just the loops and could become Tomeh, while Bais Hillel would say its still not finished and would not become Tomeh.

Perhaps, at some point, people actually did live in the wall itself? (See, e.g. Rahav who lived in the wall of Jericho.) However, the gate is a public entrance, and I understand that it is up to an individual to place the mezuzah on the home that he lives in, i.e. not a public place where no-one lives e.g. a Beth hakneset (Shulchan Aruch Yore Dea 286,3).</p>\n\n<p>Or, maybe, because there are people living in the confines of the Old City, the gate acts as a communal entrance to all the other houses, there?</p>\n\n<p>In short, does a gated walled city require a mezuzah at all?

    "content": "# How much effort should be expended searching for the missing?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Say a Jewish person gets pulled out to sea while rescuing someone from drowning and goes missing, lost at sea. And then a search for him or his body by the Jewish community, supplementing official efforts, becomes very lengthy, extensive and persistent. What does halacha say about when you should stop searching in such cases and how much effort you should expend?</p>\n\n<p>Clearly there must be limits. I am sure halacha spells them out, especially considering how many Jews went missing in wars or persecution. As an example of limits, halacha says a community is not obligated to pay a ransom bigger than what the captive would bring in the slave market.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>This answer discusses the obligation to search for a body of someone presumed dead.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Burial obligation:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי שמעון בן יוחי, רמז לקבורה מן התורה מנין, תלמוד לומר ׳כי קבור תקברנו׳ - <strong>(סנהדרין מ״ו)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam (Sefer Hamitzvos 231, see also P12 Hil. Avel) codifies burial as a <em>mitzvas asei</em>. [The Poskim deal with the usage of the term 'רמז' if it is actually <em>min hatorah</em>.]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היא שצונו לקבור הרוגי בית דין ביום שנהרגו, והוא אמרו יתעלה כי ״קבור תקברנו ביום ההוא״. לשון ספרי \"כי קבור תקברנו\" מצות עשה <strong>והוא הדין בשאר מתים</strong>, רוצה לומר שנקבור כל מתי ישראל ביום מותם. ולכן המת שאין לו מי שיתעסק בקבורתו נקרא מת מצוה, כלומר המת שמצוה על כל אדם לקברו באמרו קבור תקברנו - <strong>רמב״ם ספר המצות, עשה רל״א</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the body is missing but still retrievable, it would constitute a <em>mes mitzvah</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>How much one money must be spent to perform a mitzvah</strong>: For a personal mitzvah, the <em>halachah</em> is that one must spend up to a fifth of his possessions to fulfill his obligation. The reason for this amount is 'כדי שלא יבא לידי עוני ויפיל עצמו על הציבור'. I have not yet found a source which discusses this, but I wonder whether this limitation applies to obligations which fall upon the <em>tzibbur</em> collectively.</p>\n<p>[Interestingly, the Ramban (quoted in <em>Kesef Mishna</em> Hilchos Avel 12:1) calls this ספק איסורא, implying that he treats this as a negative commandment rather than a positive commandment, in which case there would be no ceiling to how much one is obligated to spend.]</p>\n<p><strong>How much effort must be spent</strong>:Rashi writes on the words 'לא בשמים היא' that 'שאילו היתה בשמים היית צריך לעלות אחריה וללמדה', implying that there is no limit for how much effort must be expended performing a <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If we have suspicion he may still be alive and there is a possibility of saving him, we enter a new question - the parameters of לא תעמוד על דם רעך. By a negative commandment, one is obligated to spend 'כל ממונו', not just one fifth. Nevertheless, there are indicators that by this specific <em>mitzvah</em>, this will not apply (beyond the scope of this answer, due to lack of both time and clarity)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -7)\n\n<p>Judaism values life immensely and one must even trangress all Torah prohibitions (except murder, incest and idol worship) if that would save the life of one Jew, or even just extend it slightly.</p>\n\n<p>As such, no effort is considered too much when it comes to finding a missing Jew who might still be alive but in danger.</p>\n\n<p>Of course there are Halachic guidelines also as to how much to spend on finding the body of someone who is certainly dead in order to give him a proper Jewish burial. For example, one should not retrieve a dead body for burial at the risk of human life.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the important question here is what happens when we don't actually know if the person is alive or dead - which of the above situations would apply then?\nAs long as there's still a chance that the person is alive, we must do all we can to try to save him/her.</p>\n\n<p>But what about when the chances of the person still being alive are practically zero, eg. if the person was swept out to sea many days ago and there are no islands nearby and all beaches have been searched?</p>\n\n<p>That is a difficult and painful question.</p>\n\n<p>The tragic situation you describe is made even more tragic when the missing man has a wife. Jewish law forbids a married woman from having sexual relations with anyone but her husband, and if her husband goes missing and there's even a slight chance he might have survived and is still alive, the woman is considered an Agunah and is not allowed to ever remarry or have sexual relations with any man, ever.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the plight of this woman necessitates that we do absolutely everything possible in order to find conclusive evidence as to what happened to her husband. It is no longer just about being able to bury him properly (which is a grwat Mitzva in its own right) but also about the fact that proof of the husband's death would free his wife from a lifetime of imprisonment in a marriage which is no longer and would enable her to build an intimate relationship with another man.</p>\n\n<p>We should leave no stone unturned in order to help this woman by finding her husband, even if it is almost certain that her husband is no longer alive.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to use this opportunity to raise awareness to this very painful issue and to urge all Jewish couples to arrange a Halachically valid prenuptial agreement whereby if the husband is missing for a certain amount of time (eg. a year) and his whereabouts are not known, the marriage should become void.</p>\n\n<p>This arrangement would save so much pain and heartache of so many Jews!\nIt's easy to think it would never happen to us, but the above situation of a man being swept out to sea, for example, can happen to anyone.</p>\n\n<p>Please arrange for such an agreement, and please raise awareness of the very painful issue.</p>\n\n<p>A similar arrangement can be made also by couples who are already married. Please speak to a reliable rabbi regarding how to proceed.</p>\n\n\n",

While both Chanamel and Yishmael lived in what may be considered the Roman period, given that Chanamel lived in the very early Roman period (which today is usually known as the Herodian period), I lean to think that Yishmael, who lived in the Roman period-proper, is a more likely candidate for someone in whose time there were important Romans for Dama to sit among.

The sages' willingness to pay a very large sum of money to a non-Jew for a cow may indicate that they were in a rush and desperate because one cow had already been wasted.

Thus, according to this opinion, one who copies against the creator's will is stealing his mental creation.</p>\n<p>(See Emek Hamishpat, Zechuyos Yoztrim, Intro. pp. 1-3.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of whether copyright applies to Torah works (as your question seems to imply), <strong>businesshalacha.com</strong> addresses this as well in \"<a href=\"https://www.businesshalacha.com/en/folder-money-matters/copyrights-and-patents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ownership of Torah Works</a>\" (scroll down to #6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there any difference between the copyright of Torah works and other intellectual property, such as music or secular works?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The <strong>Sho'el U'maishiv</strong> (1:44) applies full ownership rights also to Torah thoughts.</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara (Nedarim 37a) states that, in principle, Torah teachings should be disseminated for free, just as Moshe taught Am Yisrael for free.</p>\n<p>Based on this, some authorities distinguish between the copyright of Torah works and other intellectual property. Even according to the opinion that a person has actual ownership of intellectual property, they maintain that a person has only limited ownership or rights in Torah works. <strong>Beis Yitzchak</strong> (Y.D. 2:75) restricts the copyright to the first printing, which allows the author to recoup his publishing costs. The Torah requires teaching Torah thoughts for free, but it does not require the additional effort of writing or publishing for free.</p>\n<p>Others compare the rights of Torah thoughts to tovas hana'ah (incidental benefit) of terumah, which allows incidental financial benefit through distributing the Torah thoughts.</p>\n<p>Regardless, other reasons for copyright – e.g., dina d'malchusa and common commercial practice – would apply equally to Torah works.</p>\n<p>(See Emek Hamishpat, Zechuyos Yotzrim ch. 6, 12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be safe: <a href=\"https://www.yourdictionary.com/cylor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>CYLOR</strong></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Does G-d's closeness necessitate anthropomorphism?",
    "content": "# Does G-d's closeness necessitate anthropomorphism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A big part of our Jewish theology and philosophy is based on our desire to be closer to G-d (hope it's accepted unanimously). All of our analogies are built around the personification of G-d, whether we refer to Him as the Master/the King, the Father or the Spouse.</p>\n\n<p>But let's try to visualize a greater view of G-d, like Rambam's. Let's imagine that we relate to G-d as amebas or ants relate to us. In this view, all the aforementioned analogies are invalid and irrelevant as our scopes of intelligence are incompatible. And, therefore, no communication or interaction is possible on any level of sophistication higher than ours.</p>\n\n<p>So everything G-d does for us, in our imagination, has to be in human terms - speed, volume, value, etc. For example, if G-d wants to pass some information He needs to SPEAK/write, word by word, in an acceptable voice and comprehensible language (imagery), at the speed and volume of our understanding (He can't give us Torah 15Gb in size - that's incomprehensible). In other words, manifest human qualities. If He FEELS, the range of His emotions perfectly mimics ours. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore it appears that the Jewish theology necessitates G-d's anthropomorphism in order to maintain its beliefs (see Raavad's comment to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.7?lang=he&p2=Hasagot_HaRaavad_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.7.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Teshuva 3,7</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(וְהָאוֹמֵר שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם רִבּוֹן אֶחָד אֲבָל שֶׁהוּא גּוּף וּבַעַל תְּמוּנָה (נקרא מין.<br>\n  ראב\"ד: ולמה קרא לזה מין <strong>וכמה גדולים וטובים ממנו<br>\n  הלכו בזו המחשבה לפי מה שראו במקראות<br>\n  ויותר ממה שראו בדברי האגדות המשבשות את הדעות</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So do our basic concepts <em>necessitate</em> viewing G-d as anthropomorphic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To sum up the Chabad approach (based heavily on Derech Mitzvotecha Haamanut Elokut 3-9, as well as Maamar Veyadata, with sources tracing back to the Shalah, the Arizal, the Ramak and Maharal, and the Zohar):</p>\n<p>One must first recognise that we are a \"perfect mashal\" of Hashem. Let's explain what a mashal is, and then a perfect mashal. A mashal is when something, such as an idea, that is hard to understand (a nimshal) is represented by a different, but equivalent idea (the mashal):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The concept of \"greed\" is hard to understand for a 3 year old, so we have a mashal about a fox, who broke into a vineyard through a small hole, and then greedily ate until he couldn't get out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A perfect mashal is a mashal where every last detail about the nimshal is present in the mashal. In the example above, we don't just learn about greed, but we learn about its ramification: the fox had to starve himself to get back out the same hole he came in, ultimately not gaining from his greed. The animal chosen is a fox, because they are generally considered arrogant and cunning, and it is arrogance that leads to greed. If this were a perfect mashal, then the 3 year old can absorb the entire idea of greed, purely from a story about a fox and some grapes. Or, at least, he will as he gets older and contemplates the mashal, which like a time-release capsule, will gradually make him an expert in the idea. When he eventually studies about greed directly, he will recognise it.</p>\n<p>An example of a \"perfect mashal\" is Lashon Hakodesh. Its nimshal is chochma. Any intellectual idea can be represented by Lashon Hakodesh, in ink on a paper. Even though intellectual ideas are far loftier than the form of ink on paper, nonetheless, if one is as wise as Adam, one can work out the correct letters to make the correct word to describe every detail in reality, such as when he named all the animals.</p>\n<p>So, the creation is a mashal of a mashal of a mashal of Hashem. His Sefirot of Atzilut, and the sefirot that make up our souls, as well as the creation, are all directly connected by a huge (infinite?) chain of perfect mashals. Even His Sefirot of Atzilut are a Tzimtzum of His Ohr Ein Sof.</p>\n<p>At this point of the discussion, one might ask about Tzimtzum. It sounds like this implies that Hashem's connection to us is not authentic, as Hashem \"limited Himself\" at this stage. He originally could express Himself through infinite sefirot, for example, but now limits Himself to the 10 that He emanated. Therefore, imagining that He loves us (the sefira of Chesed) sounds a bit silly. Even if His love is Infinite (which it is of course, the Sefira of Chesed of Atzilut is truly infinite), love <em>itself</em> seems infinitely small and insignificant to Him. Not to mention that He loves us and our righteous deeds, which are far more insignificant still...</p>\n<p>The Tzemach Tzedek clarifies that a Tzimtzum is much greater than a mashal, but not <em>different</em> per se, just far far greater, and still perfect: <em>ein od milvado</em>. He (and all of Chassidus really) clarifies another misconception: <em>we</em> are not insignificant to Him, even if \"love\" is. His need for us is as essential as His own Essence to Him, and therefore one can say that He created love <em>in order to have us</em>, rather than the other way around (i.e. the idea that He created us because He likes to do Chesed)</p>\n<p>So, in truth, Hashem is not pretending; He is being essentially authentic. We are indeed created in a mashal of His Sefirot, and they are emanted from nothing but Godliness, and it is <strong>Him</strong> who interacts with us <em>through them</em>. So now we can summarise:</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: the Kabbalistic (before-the-advent-of-the-Zohar, as well as Zoharic) way of answering this question, as explained by Chabad Rebbeim, would be to say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are not anthropomorphising Hashem, He is <em>theomorphising us</em>. We are a \"perfect mashal\" of Him</li>\n<li>The issue of thinking about Him in our terms is that we are a mashal, so we should instead be striving to <em>see through</em> the mashal</li>\n<li>Because it is a perfect mashal, it is ultimately true, not a \"necessary fiction\". Even pointing out how insignificant we are compared to Hashem doesn't contradict this because He is ultimately being authentic; our insignificance, and the insignificance of the creation, doesn't impact His need for us.</li>\n<li>Our view indeed <em>necessitates</em> us looking as ourselves as <em>theomorphic</em> in order to avoid violating our beliefs in His Oneness and Perfection, while still being able to climb the ladder, cautiously, towards Him</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The correct view of the Rambam is that we cannot know anything abut G-d except for what G-d is not. G-d does not listen to prayers because He already knows them in advance (Gd knows everything).</p>\n\n<p>The characteristics such as wisdom are like the ones found in the Bible. Because the Torah (as Rabbi Ishmael says, it [Torah] “speaks in the language people use,”). It follows that he Torah was written for (in) human language (understanding,) thus we should not take G-d’s emotions literally (G-d has no emotions). It follows that G-d does not really becomes angry when you miss the mark and make a sin. Yet G-d’s wisdom (or chachmah) cannot be compared. Think of our DNA. Someone had to be very intelligent to create that. “For your ways are not My ways,” says Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than put G-d to an image (humanly) we should try and imitate Hashem. G-d gave us the mitzvahs for this very purpose. When one studies Torah, they experience perfection. You could boil it down some more. Man has a purpose. This is what is meant when we say the Will of G-d. King David primary insisted that the world gives praise anthropomorphically to G-d. That is, that our praise should reflect the impressive brilliance of the design and magnificence of the world. That is to our understanding of Him. Maimonides says, “In accordance with one’s knowledge [of G-d] is one’s love of G-d.” Thus, we should center our praise to the Name of Hashem because we cannot know anything about G-d except for what G-d is not (G-d has no body and is one). All we can know is G-d's creations, natural law. Therefore, people should develop their intellect and learn from the laws of nature (science). For example, when the Bible speaks about the parable of G-d talking to Moshe, it is to be understood that people cannot fathom the divine, but see His back after He passes. It is referring to the impact of natural law that G-d created. </p>\n\n<p>For “Man cannot know Me while alive.” Thus, we can only praise G-d through His name, acts, and fame. Though we cannot picture an image of letters while praising. We should not draw an image of G-d in our head. G-d should not be a person, a character, or an angel when we pray rather, G-d should be viewed as nothing because G-d does not exist. In other words, G-d is beyond the domain of existence. In order for G-d to exist, He would have to be made of some kind of material or substance, and hence a form that can be discovered. (Abraham discovered G-d by studying the heaven but this is metaphorical). G-d's essence is nothing, so you can and should picture nothing when you pray.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Deceased individuals appearing after death\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18748/17563\">this answer</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Are there any documented stories of deceased people appearing after death to live people? [I am not looking for stories where someone dead appeared in a dream]</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Kesuvos 112 records that Rebbi would descend every Friday night to make Kiddush for his family, and to participate in the Shabbos <em>seuda</em>. Do we know of this happening since?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>No. There is no evidence that the deceased ever visited or interacted with a live person, be it a dream or an actual event. Reason dictates that truth is what we can experience. Thus, no-one has ever experienced conversing with the dead. So why does the Torah prohibit this act? Because it's impossible. They couldn't possibly respond because they're dead. That is the definition of being \"dead.\"</p>\n\n<p>An example is King Saul who believed he spoke to Samuel, who foretold his impending death in his next activity, war. But in fact, it was only his imagination. He was desperate to conquer which thrilled his emotions to the point where he would latch onto anything ridiculous. He mistook a daydream of Samuel for a title of absolute authority, rendering his vision a fact, which has become so prevalent in many religious circles today. </p>\n\n<p>In his commentary to Leviticus, 19:31, Ibn Ezra says that the Torah rejects that which is unavailable not because it is true but because it is false. This is precisely the reason why G-d forbids such silly actions. Even Talmudic sages understood these stories as Aggadah (allegory).</p>\n\n<p>There even are Rishonim who claim there was no prophecy involved. Plus in Kohelet 12:7 it says, “And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to G-d, Who gave it.” The spirit (soul) goes to G-d. How then, could the soul speak to a descendant? But Rashi interprets the dust to mean Babylon and spirt to mean to be the holy spirit. After careful review of his grandson's (Rashbam) book, Rashi said that if he had more time, he would rewrite his entier commentary based on a rationalist perspective. I like to read the text for what it says. And the text does not signify that the dead can interact.</p>\n\n<p>Truth is, the Torah has no basis for mysticism. It is a belief system void of reasoning. The Prophets never turned to mystical demons for assistance. Needless to say, the Prophets have always accused the Jews of turning to useless methods such as amulets, or some other \"unseen force.\" The Prophets admonished Israel of such notions, which were in violation of Torah law.</p>\n\n\n",

Were there indeed two entities controlling man, Ahurmiz would never let Hurmiz's liquids reach his domain. From here we see that there can't be two supreme deities, one good and one evil.

Hashem did demonstrate in the Midbar that He can purify the vessels Himself, and even all of Israel heard Him, via the second level of prophecy - one under Moshe.

Chazal tell us: <em>Even a maidservant was able, at the splitting of the Red Sea, to perceive of the Divine what Yechezkel ben Buzi was unable to grasp</em>. Subsequently, Israel witnessed the Greatest Revelation at Sinai where they heard Hashem proclaim: \"I am Hashem your G-d Who took you out of the land of Egypt (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 20:2</a>). Ho after all these clear manifestations of the Divine, could Israel become confused and proclaim a molten calf: These are your gods O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.4?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 32:4</a>).</p>\n<p>In order to answer this question we must take a closer look at the statement of Chazal describing the events at the sea: <em>Even a maidservant was able, at the splitting of the Red Sea, to perceive of the Divine what Yechezkel ben Buzi was unable to grasp</em> (refrasing of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.15.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=Kli%20Yakar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kli Yakar on Shemos 15:1</a> commenting on Shemos Rabba 23:15). If indeed a maidservant was capable of such lofty unedrstanding, why is she referred to as a maidservant and not as a prophetess? The answer is that revelations and unique events on their own do not create prophets. A person may experience a lofty awareness, a lucid perception of the Divine, yet remain the same person. His knowledge and awareness will not necessarily effect any change in his personality whatsoever. <em>The maidservant,  after her experience at the sea, retained the same humble statue that she posessed before the event.</em> The genuine prophets, on the other hand, had reached prophecy after a long and arduous process of character development and self perfection. Prophecy per se was but a climax to their efforts and therefore it became an integral part of their personality.</p>\n\n\n",

Regarding Shabbos, there are other prohibitions often mixed together with <em>amirah lakum</em>, which are of a different origin and therefore would not apply by other <em>issurim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, it is forbidden to tell a gentile on Shabbos to perform a <em>melacha</em> after Shabbos, although when he will actually perform the action it would be permitted to both the gentile and the Jew. Although this is colloquially referred to as <em>amirah lakum</em> and lumped together with the general prohibition of asking a gentile to perform a <em>melacha</em>, it is actually a spin-off of a different prohibition - <em>ve'daber davar</em>; one may not talk about prohibited actions on Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>This is specific to Shabbos. When it comes to other <em>melachos</em>, the prohibition is only the יש שליח לדבר עבירה לעכו״מ מדרבנן - that Chazal forbade asking a gentile to do something prohibited on your behalf. As long as at the time of execution, it is permitted, it wouldn't matter when you said it.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true regarding <em>neheneh mi'maaseh shabbos</em>; there are instances where the <em>requesting</em> itself is permitted, but only forbidden because although it isn't <em>amirah lakum</em>, it is <em>maaseh shabbos</em> (a related, but different prohibition).</p>\n\n\n",

The Chida (Birkei Yosef OCH 301, YD 290; Chaim Sha'al 2:36) cites a tradition he had that Rabbeinu Peretz (of the Ba'alei Tosfos) wrote a <em>kimeiya</em> on Shabbos for a woman in difficult childbirth, and he quotes a ruling from the רמ\"ה (one of the Rishonim) permitting this. R' Chaim Palag'i (<em>Refuah v'Chaim</em> Perek 12) writes that R' Shalom Sharabi once wrote a <em>kimeiya</em> on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, there are two reasons why some permit it: (a) Fulfilling the wishes of a חולה שיש בו סכנה is necessary to preserve his frame of mind, because agitation could prove be detremental; (b) In certain circumstances, even mystical השתדלות is permitted under פיקוח נפש.</p>\n\n<p>Others - and, I believe, the mainstream accepted <em>halacha</em> - is that it is forbidden to desecrate Shabbos for spiritual and mystical <em>hishtadlus</em>; <em>pikuach nefesh</em> only permits practical scientific <em>hishtadlus</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Edit: I found the Maharsham (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1527&st=&pgnum=225\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chelek Gimmel, Siman 225</a>). He writes the story and the various responses, as well as adding that the Belzer Rebbe was angry, that he was now 'forced to perform a miracle' in order that it should not be Chillul Shabbos.

The anniversary of death is called \"Yahrtzeit\" in Yiddish. (Literally translated: \"Year's time\")</p>\n\n<p>I only found one source (one opinion) which directly answers this question. Therefore, I believe it is valuable to examine what the Sefarim say about a parent's Yahrtzeit so we can reach a proper analysis of the issue and come to our own answer. The following is my analysis, with the one source in bold:</p>\n\n<p>In order to answer the OP's question, we need to understand why one should fast on a Yahrtzeit for a parent.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Tanya (in Igeres HaTeshuva) discusses the Torah reason behind fasting in general. </p>\n\n<p>1) By fasting one burns up some of their fat and blood as a gift to Hashem (like offering an animal upon the altar whose main gifts were burning the fat and offering blood).</p>\n\n<p>2) By fasting, one removes themselves from the material world and is able to focus on Hashem in humility and a spirit of repentance taken seriously. This will cause a person to change their deeds for the better etc.</p>\n\n<p>(The Tanya informs us that #2 is the main concept.)</p>\n\n<p>Now if the reason one fasts on a parent's Yahrtzeit, is similar to #1 above, then we could possibly think that one should fast on a different day than a public fast day. How can one use the offering meant for one payment (the public fast) for another payment (the soul of one's parent) ?</p>\n\n<p>But, if the reason for fasting over a parent is to encourage a person to repent, (#2 above) thereby causing honor to the parent in Heaven; (Look how the child of this person is now doing a mitzvah...let Heaven ascribe the merit of the child's repentance upon the soul of the deceased.) then it does not matter if the fast coincides with an already established public fast, because the result is the same; namely that the child will repent!</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Chassidim (231; 232) gives two reasons for fasting on a parent's Yahrtzeit. </p>\n\n<p>1) Respect for the parent so the child's deeds on that day provide an atonement for the parent's soul (since the day of death is a spiritual time of judgment for the soul in Heaven).</p>\n\n<p>2) Since this anniversary day is so tragic for that child, they need extra protection provided by the spiritual merit of fasting on that day.</p>\n\n<p>The Levush also brings these two reasons.</p>\n\n<p>But, both reasons are equally addressed even if one fasts for a parent on an already public fast day.</p>\n\n<p>The poskim do address the case of a Yahrtzeit falling on a positive day like Shabbos; in which the fast is either pushed off (Shulchan Aruch) or cancelled (Rema). (See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 568:9.) </p>\n\n<p>The poskim also handle a case of someone who has a Yahrtzeit for a parent on a public fast when they are honored with Sandek by a Bris Milah.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur and Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 559:9) say that a Sandek (for instance) may eat on a Sunday, when Tisha B'Av was pushed to that Sunday from Shabbos. However, the Pri Megadim holds that only a father of the child may do so on a Yahrtzeit, not the Sandek (O.C 568:5).</p>\n\n<p>So, since we see that such cases were brought by the poskim, yet the OP's case was never addressed that I can see; therefore, it seems fair to assume that the poskim held for a simple matter that one may fast on a public fast/Yarhtzeit day, and accomplish both ideas with one fast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At least one modern day Rav holds that a public fast can accomplish both the Yahrtzeit obligation for a parent as well as doubling for the fast day it falls out on.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rav Mordechai Eliyahu (a chief Rabbi of Israel from 1983 - 1993) held that if a parent's Yahrtzeit fell out on the day before Yom Kippur, (9th Tishrei) then since one must fulfill the mitzvah to eat on erev Y\"K, one cannot fast for a parent. However, they need not make up the fast, since they may count their fast tomorrow on Yom Kippur itelf as the fast for their parent as well. (See Sefer Maamar Mordechai ; English version page 447, Entry #17 )</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also, due to tragedy or coincidence, it is not so rare that both parents might share the same Yahrtzeit. Yet, I do not see any poskim comment that mom and dad need separate days to fast, in such a case?</p>\n\n<p>This is all keeping with the general concept that the fast is to make sure the child raises their spiritual level on the day of a parent's renewed judgement, thereby honoring the parent and attributing merit to them for producing such a meritorious child. It doesn't matter if the child is fasting that day for 2 or 3 separate reasons, as long as the child is repenting and growing spiritually.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you wish to do something specifically special and exclusive for the parent?</p>\n\n<p>The Tanya (Igeres HaTeshuvah) says that nowadays we should not voluntarily fast at all, but rather give charity instead. He says this is because we are weak and fasting would be a sin that could cause neglect of Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva Eiger held this way, since in his will, he asked his children not to fast on his Yahrtzeit, but rather to eat, be strong, and learn extra Torah that day for his soul. (See this sentiment also in Minchas Yitzchak (6:135) and Natei Gavriel II 71:10 that nowadays we do not fast but we give charity to the poor in the merit of the parent's Yahrtzeit.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, one whose parent shares their Yahrtzeit with a public fast day, may be given exclusive merits, by having the child learn extra Torah or by giving extra charity, specifically for their parent's soul that day.</p>\n\n\n",

His point, is that items 1. -9. were sins committed by the Saducees. To answer the question about destruction of Jerusalem, he relies on gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.40b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 40b</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Since the world is judged by its majority, i.e., depending on whether people have performed a majority of mitzvot or a majority of sins, and an individual is likewise judged by his majority, each person must consider that if he performs one mitzva he is praiseworthy, as he tilts the balance of himself and the entire world to the scale of merit. Conversely, if he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts the balance for himself and the entire world to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good,” i.e., due to one sin that this individual commits, he squanders much goodness from himself and from the entire world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. the fate of individual, a nation, and the entire world are all determined by weighting the aggregate of their merits against the aggregate of their sins. Thus, a nation will not be found guilty by G-d if the sum of its individuals' sins outweights the sum of their merits; otherwise it is found \"not guilty\". However, as the Rambam explains in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.1-3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuvah 1:1-3</a>, not all sins and good deeds have equal weight. A single grievous sin can outweigh a number of merits, and vice versa. Hence, as the Gemara in Kiddushin concludes, \"a single mitzvah can save  the fate of the entire world,\" if the weight of this good deed tilts the overall balance in its favor...</p>\n<p>... During the Second Temple, there was no longer the prevalence of the three grave sins, that existed during the First Temple. Therefore, the Talmud argues, that all the Torah study and the mitzvos and the acts of loving-kindness of the righteous Pharicees should certainly have been sufficient to outweigh the transgressions of the Saducees and save the fate of the nation and the Temple. Although the influence of the Saducees had grown, and there were many who violated Sabbath and married non-Jewish women, a great number of them were considered unintentional sinners, because the Torah and its commandments had been forgotten, and they thus committed these transgression out of ignorance, or because they had been taught accordingly by their parents. The Torah and mitzvos of the Pharicees, on the other hand, was purely motivated and done with knowledge and forethought.</p>\n<p>Why, then, was all this not enough to prevent the Temple's destruction, the Talmud asks? Because they (i.e. the Pharicees), too, committed a very grave transgression through their vain hatred of fellow Jews. The seriousness of this transgression is magnified all the more when it is committed by otherwise righteous people who study Torah and are thus well aware of the gravity of this sin in the eyes of G-d. Therefore, it was this sin alone that sealed the fate of this generation, above and beyond the many transgressions of the Saducees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It would seem pretty obvious except for the fact they don’t recognize the Jewish people as Hashem’s Chosen. They also have their own slightly altered Torah, which I do not think would be allowed. The Samaritans of time past worshiped idols that they excused by not putting them “Before” Hashem. The Samaritans of past times also led Jews astray by defying the authority of rabbis or any rabbinic sources, while also in the end worshipping idols.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Samaritans are non-Jews (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/87697/11501\">here</a> for details). I once asked a religious tour guide who has been many times to Har Gerizim. He told me that today \"As far as anyone can tell they are complete monotheists\".</p>\n\n<p>As such, according to the Rambam, a Samaritan who would observe the seven <em>mitzvot Bnei Noach</em> is considered one of 'the pious among the gentiles' and will merit a share in the world to come (see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 8:11</a> as well as the end of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Tshuva 3:5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This being said, we are not specialists of the Samaritans here on MiYodeya.

    "content": "# Can Rabbis decide whether non-Jews are getting a piece of the Next World?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember asking about the limitations of the Rabbinical rulings, based on \"לא בשמים היא\" within Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>After other questions dealt with deciding whether Gentiles in general or any specific group (the Samaritans) is entitled to a piece in <em>our</em> World to Come (WtC), I came up with the question of the validity of our speculations. </p>\n\n<p>It seems that those two belong to two different domains - one is what our Sages are allowed to deal with (this world) and what will always remain G-d's domain (WtC).</p>\n\n<p>I would speculate that in this relativistic world, G-d \"does not care\" what the Halachah says only that people follow it (like that the Sages ruled that משיכה buys instead of G-d's כסף) but in the WtC who can limit G-d to think we know better?</p>\n\n<p>Hence the question: as our scriptures do not deal almost completely with the questions of the WtC and everything we know about the WtC is Rabbinical thinking how valid are those and how obligating are they to G-d?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Sanhedrin 10:3 discusses whether certain groups of people have a share in the world to come. In his commentary there, Rambam writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כבר זכרתי לך פעמים רבות שכל מחלוקת שיהיה בין החכמים שאינו בא לידי מעשה אלא שהוא אמונת דבר בלבד אין צד לפסוק הלכה כאחד מהם</p>\n<p>I have already mentioned many times that any dispute between the Sages that does not affect practice, but is merely a factual question, there is no way to rule halacha in accordance with one of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would argue that Rambam is essentially saying that the Sages can tell you what the law is in a given case, but they can’t determine the reality. Since the status of one’s share in the world to come is not a question of law, it is simply beyond the purview of the Sages.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 29a</a> and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=18&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 18a</a>, Rabban Gamliel and R' Chanina ben Tradyon swear to non-Jews that they'll get them into the World to Come. \"Swearing\" to do so seems pretty well to indicate that they have that power, otherwise they'd be taking the chance of violating the issur of a false oath.**</p>\n\n<p>There's also a Gemara in Sanhedrin (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=104b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">104b</a>) that tells how the Chachomim wanted to add \"another one\" (Rashi says it was Shlomo) to the list of those who lost their place in Olam Haba, and Hashem had to prevent them from doing so. The implication seems to be that had they decided after all that he's on the list, then Hashem would (so to speak) be constrained to follow their decision.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=15b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 15b</a>, where Acher is \"in limbo\" (the Heavenly Court won't send him to either the World to Come or to \"judgment\" (Gehinnom)), until first R' Meir intervenes to get him sent to judgment, and later R' Yochanan intervenes to get him to the World to Come.</p>\n\n<p>Still more examples: <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=15b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 54b</a>, where Rav Preida gets \"myself and my entire generation\" into the World to Come. Also in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=106b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 106b</a>, Hashem (so to speak) \"consults\" with David about whether Doeg should get into the World to Come, and David rejects the idea.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>** OK, so maybe it wouldn't <em>technically</em> violate that, since it would be a case of oness. I still would think that these Sages wouldn't put themselves in a situation where they might be compelled to break their word.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This will be a personal answer.</p>\n\n<p>I do not believe Rabbis can determine whether <strong>anyone</strong> has a share in the next world. However, I do think the claims Rabbis make about who goes and doesn't get a share in the next world serve a great purpose. </p>\n\n<p>Religion in general has the Job problem, which is, why do bad things happen to good/religious people? Despite us all knowing the story of Job and knowing he was righteous and God Himself declaring that Job was right to his doubting friends, we still have a tendency to believe/say that good things will happen to the righteous, and bad things will happen to the unrighteous. We can't know the will of God, or why God allows certain things to happen to certain people, but we fall into the temptation of assuming things about people one way or another. As humans we like to think that our actions have value, therefore keeping kashrut might initially be \"because I want to serve Hashem,\" but eventually might turn into \"it helps guarantee my place in the world to come.\" The next step after that is \"someone who doesn't do it might not get a place in the world to come.\" This kind of thinking or logic isn't beneficial, and is problematic thelogically and religiously.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this last type of thinking is something the sages often try to address. While many Jews might be tempted to think or believe that non Jews who don't follow all the laws won't get a share in the world to come, the truth is we don't really know and the Tanakh doesn't make it clear one way or the other. The Rabbis come in to say \"Yes! Non Jews have a place in the world to come! They just have to follow these few Noahide moral laws.\" Do I believe that this statement by the Rabbis binds the hands of God who must now allow Noahides into the world to come? No.</p>\n\n<p>Do I believe this statement comes to teach us that we shouldn't try and say or even believe that Non Jews don't have a share in the world to come? Yes.</p>\n\n\n",

What is implied? When a receptacle is hollowed out from a block of wood and then a metal anvil is inserted into it, if it is a blacksmith's, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity. Although it has a receptacle, it was made to be filled. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.

They have a particularly hard time when first leaving the protective environment and trying to adjust to the new stimuli for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>In the story of Bnos Moav the Jews experience a re-entry shock, which is given to them as a relatively small event to prepare them before they actually leave their isolation completely. The challenge here is because of the novelty of the situation, the desire to let go of the intense religious state, connect to \"normal\" life. It was not a test of everyday sexual desire. It was a test of how well they can maintain their state without a supporting environment, and it was meant to prepare them before they would completely be out of their supporting environment.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do slaves owned by jews observe shabbat (day of rest)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To my understanding it is a commandment of God that those who live among jews observe Shabbat. Historically, slaves owned by jews must have lived among them. Does Gods commandment apply to slaves, if so - was the commandment observed/practiced?</p>\n\n<p>I have become curious about Jewish slave ownership in part because of the centrality of the exodus story to contemporary jewish belief. Discovering that Jews owned slaves has been quite puzzling to me considering I have eaten many passover dinners growing up with Orthodox Jewish grandparents. I am having difficulty understanding how a jew could observe passover celebrating freedom from slavery on Seder night, while at the same time legalize the ownership of slaves, would someone please explain the difference.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>A Canaanite slave (who's mother is Canaanite and father is foreign) is obligated in all negative Mitzvot which includes keeping Shabbos just like a Jewish woman (and some positive Mitzvot including Kiddush Bentching eating matza and Korban Pesach). He cannot become a slave to a Jew unless he fully accepts the Mitzvot and has to do Mila  (circumsision) <strong>voluntarily</strong> and Tevila (immersion for the sake of servitude) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.48a.6?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 48a</a></p>\n\n<p>The Rabeinu Bacheye (13th Century kabbalist) in Exodos 21,26 explains that the Canaanite slave is a Tikkun (spiritual rectification) for the soul of the Canaanite forefather Cham who acted immorally with his father Noach and was cursed to be enslaved by others. This is the Kabalistic meaning why a Kenaanite slave goes free when his eye or tooth gets knocked out, since Cham sinned by seeing his father's nakedness, and by speaking using his teeth to his brothers about the act which he had done with his father, when the tooth or eye gets knocked out he has atoned for the sin of Cham and may go free.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכי יכה איש את עין עבדו. מצות התורה בעבד כנעני שיצא בשן ועין, והטעם בזה מפני שלא נשתעבדו אלא בשן ועין, שנאמר (בראשית ט) וירא חם אבי כנען את ערות אביו ויגד לשני אחיו בחוץ, ראה בעיניו והגיד בפיו ונתקלל על זה ארור כנען עבד עבדים יהיה לאחיו וכיון שלקו האברים החוטאים נפטר הגוף מעונש עבדות. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So in answer to your question</strong> there is no forced subjugation as the slave has to accept Judaism otherwise cannot be a Slave. The reason why someone would do this is because of the spiritual need to Rectify his soul by accepting the Mitzvos (commandments)of G-d and realising that he can atone for his previous incarnation's sins and ultimately become a servant of G-d just like Eliezer Avraham's servant (a decendant of Cham) who was eventually freed and enterred Gan Eden alive (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/88995/was-eliezer-a-tzaddik-or-a-rasha/89870#89870\">Derech Eretz zuta 1,5</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Both Hebrew and non-Jewish slaves must observe Shabbos:</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew slave is not actually a slave, he's a full-time day and night employee lodging by his master for 6 years or till the Jubilee year (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodos 21, 2-11</a>), so he's obligated in all Mitzvos including 3 daily prayers and keeping Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Non-Jewish slaves are considered an \"extension\" of their Master's souls and are obligated to keep Shabbos as the verse says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.20.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20,10</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי שַׁבָּת לַה\"א לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה כָל מְלָאכָה<br>\n  אַתָּה וּבִנְךָ וּבִתֶּךָ <strong>עַבְדְּךָ וַאֲמָתְךָ</strong> וּבְהֶמְתֶּךָ וְגֵרְךָ אֲשֶׁר בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ. </p>\n  \n  <p>\"but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God: you shall not do any work—you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why, instead to he resort to Bilam's ability to curse?</p>\n\n<p>In his weekly drasha. my rav used this to explain / prove the historical \"focus\" that anti-Semites have had for millennia.

By cursing someone at that time, Bilaam could cause the Midat Hadin to bring judgement against the person he cursed. In other words, Bilaam did not have the power to bless. </p>\n\n<p>According to Sforno, Balak was well aware of this, so he did not request a blessing. He flattered Bilaam by saying he could bless in order to make him more likely to to accept his request.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Balak knew that Bilaam held the power of blessing and curses from personal experience.

Consequently, such women are not forbidden to the priesthood on account of unchastity, nor is a woman prohibited to her husband because of it, since this does not constitute unchastity. But it is appropriate to flog such women since they have done a forbidden thing. A man should be particularly strict with his wife in this matter, and should prevent women known to indulge in such practices from visiting her, and her from going to visit them.”</p>\n\n<p>As such, a woman in this position would not be considered a <em>sotah</em> and would be permitted to remain with her husband even if he were a Kohain.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sefek with brachos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>lf I ate olives and I have a sefek by the bracha acronah. Sefek number 1 is maybe I ate a kezayis. Even if I didn’t, maybe a berya (whole item) requires a bracha. By sefirat Ha'Omer , if I have a sefek , I count during the day and continue counting the rest of the days with a bracha based on sefek sefika. What’s the difference? The common answer that is given is by the olives the sefek itself is the bracha . So by sefek brachos we go lekula.But by sefirah , the sefek sefika says I am obligated to count again . Once I count again, I must say the bracha as well.\nIn siman samach Zein the Mishnah birurah brings down if you have a sefek by a Torah obligation, so you must repeat the action , yet there is a disagreement if you must repeat the bracha as well. Why by sefira, the sefek sefika obligates me to repeat action and everyone agrees say bracha, but by a Torah obligation say lulav even though I must repeat action because safek deoraisa lechumra there is disagreement if I must repeat bracha as well.What is the difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To clarify the question: The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.489.7?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">489:7</a>) clearly says <em>not</em> to make a blessing in the day if you forgot to count at night (the case of doubt, since some opinions hold you have to count at night). The case that needs to be explained is why you can make a blessing on the following days (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.489.8?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">489:8</a>) according to those opinions that you never make a blessing in case you are in doubt whether you are fulfilling a commandment.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest answer is that the poskim who hold that you don't repeat the blessing in case of doubt would hold the same with regard to counting the omer (against the Shulchan Aruch). This is what the Gra (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.489.8?lang=he&with=Beur%20HaGra&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">489:8</a>) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכ\"ז לדעת הפוסקים דבספק דאורייתא מברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the original rationale of the Shulchan Aruch might suggest that counting the omer is an exceptional case. The opinions that hold that the entire counting is one commandment base it on the wording of שבע שבתות <strong>תמימות</strong>, seven <em>complete</em> weeks. If you miss counting one night but still do it in the day, your counting can still be called \"complete\" because you did do it during the day, even according to the view that you didn't fulfill that night's obligation. This is apparently the view of the Terumat Haddeshen (quoted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.489.1?lang=he&p2=Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.489.9.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bet Yosef 489:8</a>)<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2070\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"></a>, who is the source of the rule brought in the Shulchan Aruch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דמיקרי שפיר תמימות הואיל ולא דילג יום אחד לגמרי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Ramba\"n says that Israel sent them messengers requesting passage through the land in the same way that they sent messengers to Sichon. If we view the language they said to Sichon, they stated that they will walk only on the King's highway, and will not drink their water. It seems that those statements should clarify all intents that Israel didn't have any desire to do anything to Moav's land.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have seen commentary explaining that since the Bnai Yisrael could conquer and destroy the surrounding nations, Moav would lose all of its trading partners. Thus, while leaving Moav alone, they would <em>lick up</em> the source of wealth that Moav gained from all of its neighbors, leaving it isolated in what was now a barren and worthless area. An ox uses its tongue to rip the grass out of the ground in order to eat it, not even leaving the roots. The analogy is to oxen totally destroying a grazing area as they rip the grass away from the ground and leaving it barren.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the message sent to the elders of Midyan said that the entire surroundings of Moav (all the neighboring nations) would be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>As the pasuk says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moab said to the elders of Midian, \"Now this assembly will eat up\n  <strong>everything around us</strong>, as the ox eats up the greens of the field. Balak\n  the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950/showrashi/true#v4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Balak 22:4</a> explains this as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>as the ox eats up:</strong> Whatever the ox has eaten up no longer contains\n  blessing [because the ox uproots the plants it eats (Da’ath Zekenim)].\n  — [Mid. Tanchuma Balak 3, Num. Rabbah 20:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/22.3#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban explains</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפילו שלא ילכדו את ארצנו ילחכו ברובם את כל סביבותינו, כלחוך השור את\n  ירק השדה, וילכדו להם את כל סביבותינו כאשר עשו לשני מלכי האמורי ויתנו\n  אותנו למס עובד.</p>\n  \n  <p>Even if they do not conquer our land, they will <em>lick up</em> in their\n  numbers all of our surroundings, like the ox licks up the greenery of\n  the field, and they will conquer all of our surroundings as they did\n  to the two Amorite kings and they will take us as <em>tax slaves</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/22.4#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אור החיים explains</a> that this implies the entire surrounding area and not just Moav</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ילחכו וגו׳ את כל סביבותינו – אולי שלא רצו להראות כל כך מורך הלבב שהם\n  יראים מהם אלא שהם חסים על הסביבות, ואמרו לשון רבים לכלול אותם עמהם,</p>\n  \n  <p>It appears that they did not want to express such fear on themselves,\n  but that they were worried on the surroundings, and they expressed\n  themselves in the plural language to include the others with them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Bnai Yisrael had promised not to harm anyone who allowed it to pass through, they were intent on conquering the land of Canaan. This would have destroyed the major economic strengths of the area. The Egyptians had already lost their economic power as a result of the makos. Once the Bnai Yisrael had conquered Canaan, the trade routes to Egypt would be cut off and trade would not resume once Egypt had recovered (and more than a full generation had passed so it may already have done so). Also the fact of what they had done to Sichon when he attacked them showed what they could do. An analogy could be made to the Great Depression of 1929 which built up as a result to the aftermath of World War I. Even the <em>winning</em> nations of Europe were in major economic trouble.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch shows that לחך implies total consumption.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לחך means to lick, to lick up; to lick up water or dust with the\n  tongue:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As he explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now as a matter of fact the ox first grasps with its tongue, the grass\n  which it tears up and swallows. So that one can literally say \"the ox\n  licks up the grass\", and לחך here is an apt expression. But the sense\n  of the message was: - as naturally and effortless as the ox takes the\n  grass for its food, so naturally and easily will we all become the\n  booty of this קהל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I saw an answer from the Lubavitcher Rebbe (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15983&pgnum=61\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat Parshat Balak 1988</a>) based on Rashi's commentary on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9949#showrashi=true&v=26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 21:26</a>. There, the verse says that \"<em>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and he had fought against the first king of Moab, taking all his land from his possession, as far as Arnon.</em>\". Rashi explains that the verse goes into this history to let us know that Sichon's conquering of the land made it permissible for the Jews to conquer it, even though it originally belonged to Moav.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe says that the nations did not know that such a thing was possible (they considered it still their land). So when Balak saw that the Jews conquered and settled Cheshbon, they  thought that the prohibition against conquering the lands of Ammon and Moav no longer applied, and therefore Moav was afraid that the Jews would now conquer their land.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>We see something similar in the story of Yiftach the Judge in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15819#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 11</a>. In that story, we see that Ammon claimed the Jews conquered their land. Yiftach answered that the Jews did not take the land from Ammon, but rather from Sichon, who had conquered it from Ammon.</p>\n\n<p>We see from here that Ammon still considered the land theirs, even though it had been conquered by someone else. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>I heard an answer from the name of a rishon, but I didn't remember the name, that until now Moav wasn't really keeping the sheva Mitzvos as they should, but Hashem didn't judge them so much because there was no one else to compare them to.</p>\n<p>And even though the Jews were in the desert, and we're a lot more righteous, Moav could argue that they are only righteous because they have everything taken care of for them in the desert with the man, well etc.</p>\n<p>But when they go into the land , Moav was worried that the Jews would continue being righteous anyway, and in that case Hashem would start judging Moav for their comparatively less-than-righteous behavior.</p>\n\n\n",

This is because Kabbalat Shabbat is considered a \"separate service\", and technically, it is \"not yet Shabbat \" (We have a M.Y. question explaining this - I have to locate it.) so that person is still \"in mourning display mode.\" Once Shabbat, is \"official\", which occurs with reciting Psalm 92, the mourner accepts Shabbat and he may not display public mourning.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, that this action indicates that a minyan is not needed to say <em>Kabbalat Shabbat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There is a separate angle as to whether the recitation of Psalm 92 is the only method to indicate Shabbat acceptance, and even when used, does an individual reciting that Psalm accept Shabbat, or is it only for a <em>tzibbur</em>.

The  Birkat Asher has various answers to this question. One is from the Oruch LeNer who says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפי ה\"ערוך לנר\" לא בא פינחס להמלך במשה על עצם דין \"קנאין פוגעין בו\",\n  אלא מסופק היה אם מותר לו לקנא לה' בהיותו כהן   That Pinchas did not\n  come to ask Moshe on the halacha in this case but he was in doubt as\n  to whether he could do the act of  zealotry, as he was a Kohen and\n  he might become tomei through the action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do not understand this answer because at the time that  Pinchas did his act, he was not yet a Kohen as Rashi points out <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.25.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbor 25 (13)</a> </p>\n\n<p>‎</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A COVENANT OF AN EVERLASTING PRIESTHOOD — for although the priesthood\n  had already been given to Aaron’s descendants (cf.

To\n  counter this, the verse states “by causing her to act\n  licentiously,”indicating that it is with regard to profaning that\n  involves licentiousness that the verse is speaking. <strong>The reference is\n  to one who gives his daughter to a man for the purpose of intercourse\n  that is not for the sake of marriage.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the English translation is accurate (I am unable to consult the original text) it would seem, if I am not mistaken, that the expression in this baraita  <strong>\"intercourse that</strong> <strong>is not for the sake of marriage\"</strong> refers to any intercourse consumed outside the marriage relationship.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if there are more limited  interpretations in the Jewish tradition about such specific  expression, referring only  to the hypothesis of casual/promiscuous sex (paid or not), or sexual intercourse consumed between an unmarried woman and a man she can’t halachically  marry (therefore with reference to a woman \"zonah\" in the strictly legal  sense, also considering that \" lehaznotah \" has the same linguistic root, if I am not mistaken, of \"zonah\").</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban explains אל תחלל את בתך להזנותה to refer to relationship for which there is no <em>Kiddushin</em> (Halachic marriage) possible, for example a Canaanite slave or a <em>goi</em>; see Malbim Leviticus 19:29 who explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרמב\"ן השיג על רש\"י שפירש שמוסרה אליו שלא לשם אישות דאם כן אתיא כר' אליעזר דסבר פנוי הבא על הפנויה עשאה זונה ולא קיי\"ל כוותיה. ועל כן פירש שמדבר אם מסרה למי שאין קדושין תופסין בה והולך לשיטתו שחולק עם הרמב\"ם (במנין המצות ס' שנה ובחבורו ריש הל' אישות) על הבא על הפנויה דרך זנות. ולהרמב\"ן קאי על מי שאין קדושין תופסין כגון עבד     </p>\n  \n  <p>Rashi says the Passuk is refering to someone who gives his daughter not for the sake of marriage to someone else who is not forbidden to her. Ramban says however this only fits with the opinion of the Tanna Rabbi Elazar who says a non-matrimonial relationship makes a woman forbidden to a Cohen as a <em>Zonah</em>. However since we hold like the Rabanan (whosay out of wedlock relations with a Kosher Jew do not render a woman unfit to marry a Kohen)  the correct interpretation of the Passuk is not to give ones unmarried daughter to a Slave or others whom there is no <em>Kiddushin</em> to her and thus renders her a Zonah unfit to marry a Cohen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Targum Onkles seems to (a bit like the Ramban) understand the passuk meaning giving ones daughter to a Gentile who will lead his daughter astray (see targum <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=Onkelos%20Deuteronomy&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> using the same language) for meaning of Taus which will lead her astray away from the Torah and Mitzvos </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לָא תַחֵיל יָת בְּרַתָּךְ לְאַטְעָיוּתַהּ וְלָא תִטְעֵי אַרְעָא וְתִתְמְלֵי אַרְעָא עֵיצַת חֲטִאין </p>\n  \n  <p>Do not profane your daughter (in marriage) to lead her astray from Hashem, and the land shall not go astray and be filled with sinful thoughts .</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note the Semag (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ben_Jacob_of_Coucy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Moshe Micoucy</a>, 13th century) Asei 48 and Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 2,9 are of the opinion that אל תחלל את בתך להזנותה refers to the father to give his daughter to an Old man for marriage (as a prevention of <em>eishes Ish</em> because of her discontent with the forced marriage imposed by her father to an old man when she was not yet a <em>Bogeres</em>) like Rabbi Eliezer (not rabbi Elazar) says in Sanhedrin 76a.</p>\n\n\n",

Asher ben Shaul of Narbonne (13th century France) in his Sefer haMinhagot (pg. 141) [15] recorded that the blessing was not cited in his region:</p>\n  \n  <p>ומי שעוטר מצנפת כמו שעושין בספרד מברך עוטר ישראל בתפארה שדומה לעטרת, והזכיר ישראל מפני שכינה שהיא שורה עליהם, ולא יתכן שילכו בגלוי ראש ועל כן קשר להם כתרים בסיני לכל אחד, וכן אמרו בתלמוד (קידושין לא א) שכינה למעלה מראשי, ולא כן הגוים. מכל מקום (הוא) משמע שאע”פ שאין אנו מתעטרין במצנפת אנו מתעטרין בכובעין דין הוא שנברך עוטר ישראל אלא שאין מנהגנו לומר כן, ונראה בעיני שהמנהג שלנו שאין אנו מברכין משום דאין כל ישראל מכסין ראשיהם והולכין בגילוי הראש.</p>\n  \n  <p>Asher recognized that עוטר ישראל בתפארה was an appropriate blessing for the turban because “it resembles a crown” (דומה לעטרת).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see similar accounts in the 14th century.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B) R. David Abudirham, a resident of 14th century Christian Spain, in his enumeration of the morning blessings in Sefer Abudirham [16] (1339) skips any version of the head-covering blessing. In a later chapter he wrote [17]:</p>\n  \n  <p>ועוד מוסיף בגמ’ כשמניח סדינו על ראשו מברך עוטר ישראל בתפארה על שם (שם קג, ד) המעטרכי חסד ורחמים ועל שם (ישעיה מט, ג) ישראל אשר בך אתפאר. והטעם לברכה זו לפי שהיו עוטרים מצנפת כדי שלא ילכו בגלוי הראש. ואמר כאן ישראל לפי שהשכינה שורה עליהם ולא על הגוים. ובכל ארץ ישמעאל נוהגין לאומרה מפני שהם מניחים מצנפת על ראשם, אבל באלו הארצות אין נוהגין לאמרה כי אינם מניחין מצנפת. אבל נוהגין לומר ברכה אחרת שאינה נזכרת בגמרא …</p>\n  \n  <p>The intention of Abudirham appears to be that in Christian Spain (“these lands”) the turban was not worn by Jews and therefore no headdress blessing was said, unlike in North Africa and the Levant [18].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.uncensoredjudaism.com/en/archives/1857\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.uncensoredjudaism.com/en/archives/1857</a></p>\n\n<p>While these sources don't conclusively prove when Jews started wearing a hat in Europe, it does say that the European Jewish community had broken with traditional Jewish dress and had actually removed a Talmudic blessing from their religious practice. The sources above indicate that many Jews didn't wear a headcovering at all (not even a kippah!). It therefore makes sense that the blessing would not be re-instituted for \"the hat\" that is now in common use since the hat was clearly a later use of a gentile article of clothing.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that now almost no Jewish communities say this blessing when putting on a head covering. This and all the other dressing related blessings have been relegated to a fixed part of the \"morning\" service and are now said in synagogues, completely separated from the acts they were tied to in Talmudic times. I have only seen certain Rambam based groups who continue the proper practice of saying this blessing with a turban style head covering.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Jews in Europe (and other parts of the world) were often forced to wear clothes that distinguished them from non Jews. This way Christians and Muslims would be able to tell who was and wasn't a Jew based on their style of clothes. There were many styles of hats that Jews in Europe were forced to wear that were different based on location or time, but many times these articles of clothe were meant to embarrass or humiliate the Jews on top of setting them apart. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_hat#/media/File:Codex_Manesse_S%C3%BC%C3%9Fkind_von_Trimberg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is an example from the 14th Century.</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_hat#/media/File:GermanJews1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is another example from Germany in the 13th century.</a> You can see many more sources and styles from going to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_hat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Wikipedia article.</a> It seems fair to say that Jews would not want to say the blessing of \"crowning Israel with glory/splendor\" over an article of clothing they were forced to wear by non Jews in order to humiliate them.</p>\n\n<p>In more recent times Jews were not forced to wear distinctive types of hats or clothing and many took the custom to wear clothes that didn't make them stand out by copying their non Jewish neighbors. Many theorize that this led to the wearing of hats that we see by Hassidic Jews in our days. When this officially began to happen is hard to tell. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The idea of a religious head covering seems to have been a מנהג since ancient times, as seen in Sepher Shemuel II 15:30</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לוְדָוִ֡ד עֹלֶה֩ בְמַעֲלֵ֨ה הַזֵּיתִ֜ים עֹלֶ֣ה | וּבוֹכֶ֗ה וְרֹ֥אשׁ לוֹ֙ חָפ֔וּי וְה֖וּא הֹלֵ֣ךְ יָחֵ֑ף וְכָל־הָעָ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־אִתּ֗וֹ חָפוּ֙ אִ֣ישׁ רֹאשׁ֔וֹ וְעָל֥וּ עָלֹ֖ה וּבָכֹֽה</p>\n<p>And Daveed ascended upon the Mount of Olives, and weeping as he went up with his head covered, and he went barefoot; all of the people that were with him, each man covered his head and wept as they ascended</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And therefore they said that the mouth of the donkey is of the things created at twilight. But what appears in our eyes based on the true principles that are apparent from the words of the prophecy and from philosophy is that this incident was something that occurred to Bilam in a prophetic vision. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ralbag here openly acknowledges that he is disagreeing with the Sages, and that doesn’t seem to bother him. This is apparently because the interpretations that deny that events literally occurred as described in Scripture are primarily based on  philosophy, an area in which the Sages don’t necessarily have any special authority. Indeed, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/96321/13438\">elsewhere</a> Ralbag quotes the Sages and very strongly disagrees with them based on a fundamental philosophical principle. In that instance he specifically states that in these types of matters we are not bound by the statements of the Sages... and he cites Rambam as the source for this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא שבאלו הענינים ובכיוצא בהם לא נביט למאמר אומר כמו שהורנו הרב המורה אבל נמשך אל מה שיאות על שרשי התורה והעיון </p>\n  \n  <p>But in these matters and the like we do not look at who says it, as Rambam has taught, but we follow that which fits with the principles of Torah and philosophy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the most basic answer to your question here is that Rambam was openly disputing the view of the Sages, and was not overwhelmed by that. Indeed, there are examples in Rambam’s writings where he clearly rejects the views of some Sages on philosophical grounds. For instance, in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>  3:31 Rambam ridicules the view that the commandments have no reasons, but in 3:48 he acknowledges that that is the view of the Mishnah. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>THERE are persons who find it difficult to give a reason for any of the commandments, and consider it right to assume that the commandments and prohibitions have no rational basis whatever. They are led to adopt this theory by a certain disease in their soul, the existence of which they perceive, but which they are unable to discuss or to describe. </p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp167.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When in the Talmud (Ber. p. 33b) those are blamed who use in their prayer the phrase, \"Thy mercy extendeth to young birds,\" it is the expression of the one of the two opinions mentioned by us, namely, that the precepts of the Law have no other reason but the Divine will. We follow the other opinion.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the question of what actually happened in this incident is ultimately a historical question. Rambam elsewhere disagrees with the Sages in matters of historical occurrence. For example, the Talmud (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=28&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 28a</a>) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ההוא יומא בר תמני סרי שני הוה אתרחיש ליה ניסא ואהדרו ליה תמני סרי דרי חיורתא היינו דקאמר ר' אלעזר בן עזריה הרי אני כבן שבעים שנה ולא בן שבעים שנה</p>\n  \n  <p>He was eighteen years old that day, and a miracle was wrought for him and eighteen rows of hair [on his beard] turned white. That is why R. Eleazar b. Azariah said: Behold I am about seventy years old,  and he did not say [simply] seventy years old.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_28.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam, however, in his commentary to the Mishnah that is cited here in the Talmud, gives a different explanation in which R. Elazar Ben Azariah's beard did not miraculously turn white.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, R. Solomon Luria in his commentary to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=52b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 52b</a> argues with an <em>amora</em> as to the historical reality of what another <em>amora's</em> reasoning for a specific action was. He defends this by noting that it is permissible to dispute the Sages in matters that don't pertain to law:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואינני כחולק על התלמוד שהרי אין בו נפקותא לא לחיובא ולא לפטורא ואין זה אלא למשיחא</p>\n  \n  <p>And I am not like one who disagrees with the Talmud, for there is no relevance to obligation or exemption, and it is only for Messiah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in Rambam’s commentary to the Mishnah in Avot he explains that the point is that miracles were programmed into nature from the outset, and he mentions the mouth of the donkey without saying that it didn’t actually happen in reality. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I would say that it is nothing new that Rambam's view on interpreting various \"impersonations\" found in the Torah challenges the widely accepted anthropomorphic view. (This is true not only regarding G-d but angels and other visions)</p>\n\n<p>He writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.7?lang=bi&with=Hasagot%20HaRaavad&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuva 3,7</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָאוֹמֵר שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם רִבּוֹן אֶחָד<br>\n  .[אֲבָל שֶׁהוּא גּוּף וּבַעַל תְּמוּנָה [הוא מין וכו</p>\n  \n  <p>(3) he who says that there is One Lord; but that He is corporeal and has a form [is an atheist]; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Raava\"d stands for the common view:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולמה קרא לזה מין? <strong>וכמה גדולים וטובים ממנו הלכו בזו המחשבה לפי מה שראו במקראות ויותר ממה שראו בדברי האגדות המשבשות את הדעות</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I can see from this critique that Rambam evidently contradicts the view of those \"bigger that him\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>BTW Rambam does not align with the Mishnah or Gemmorah many many times in Halachic issues also.</em></p>\n\n\n",

If that's not a focus for you, I would recommend the Tuv Yerushalaim for a beginner.

To understand this from Rambam’s perspective, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sales.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Sefer Kinyan, Hilchot Machirah, chapter 2 beginning at the second law</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The High Holiday services – Avinu Malkeinu, “Our Father, Our King”, is a legend. Yet it is inspiring like the Kol Nidre prayer probably because of the music associated with it. But is the prayer rational? More often than not, people are not drawn to the words but the music. The Kol Nidre has increasingly become controversial when it claims we can retroactively annul vows, and Avinu Malkeinu became controversial when it described G-d in masculine terms.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud, Taanit 25b, tells the story of a draught. Rabbi Eliezer prayed for rain in “twenty-four blessings.” G-d did not answer. Where was G-d? What did you except, a voice? That G-d would talk to you as He did with Moshe? Rabbi Eliezer knew G-d acted. Rabbi Akiva said three lines.</p>\n\n<p>“Our father, our king, we have sinned before you. Our father, our king, we have no king other than you. Our father, our king, for your sake, have mercy upon us.”</p>\n\n<p>And it worked. It rained. G-d answered him by natural law, what Maimonides calls the “first cause” because G-d did not actually do it, rather it is attributed to G-d because G-d triggered the Big Bang and thus, made it rain when Akiva prayed. G-d knows everything and established that it would rain in advance. No re-adjustments needed. But this anthropomorphic prayer sounds almost disrespectful. Can we tell G-d what is needed in the creation, in this case, more rain? Can humans produce rain with magic? Why does a short prayer works where a long one doesn't? Moshe prayed a five-word prayer to cure his sister of leprosy. It worked. Why? </p>\n\n<p>Today this prayer is celebrated in the significant High Holiday prayers. We stand and sing to this prayer. Beat our hearts with our first to show penitence in this prayer. But most women dislike it. Is G-d only a \"He?\" Is there any metaphor that can or should be applied in this reading?</p>\n\n<p>In Rabbi Lawrence A. Hoffman’s six-volume book “Naming God” (2015), he explains how the High Holiday prayers of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur should be understood. I literally read this book to answer this question more thoroughly. In it, the rabbi collected over a dozen prayers, analyzed them, and interpret them to the best of his ability. I think he answered this well. He touches upon the masculine imagery in the Avinu Malkeinu prayer. He explains that feminist have a hard time saying this prayer because it depicts G-d with male features. You would check Rabbi Tony Bayfield’s views on Rabbis’ Ishmael and Akiva, regarding this. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Ishmael rightly assumed that G-d - as Maimonides explained - is transcendental and incorporeal. And although the Torah “speaks in the language people use,” it is because people have a hard time comprehending a G-d which has no body. The Torah, like sacrificers, allows G-d to be depicted in human form. For people to understand or get the message across. But people should realize that this is not literally. The corporeal language of the Torah, as with all the repetitions, were recorded in the way that people talked. For example, many people reinstate themselves for emphasis or to make more of a flowery point, and the Bible’s no exception. Though one could try and disprove the Bible for being written in such a fashion, Maimonides contends that it was done for humanity’s sake. Maimonides and people who are likewise as rationally-minded would agree with Rabbi Ishmael’s view. Though neither he nor Maimonides perfectly addressed this issue, we can deduce that this was the case because this was how people talked. Naturally, every culter/civilization has associated G-d with a “He.\" </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva agrees that G-d has no body and is one. Yet, he saw the apparent repetitions in the Torah as teaching a new idea. G-d does not repeat Himself. He saw G-d approaching, willing to change natural law at any moment’s notice. G-d is always involved in the world and commands a leaf to fall, keep falling, keep falling, stop. His prayer for rain demonstrated that G-d is active and involved in prayer and responds to human needs. The Avinu Malkeinu prayer, a legend of the great Rabbi Akiva, reflects his poison when he metaphorically calls G-d a father and a king. But people who prefer Rabbi Ishmael's G-d concept or those who are feminist may struggle with this prayer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The correct view of the Rambam is that we cannot know anything abut G-d except for what G-d is not. G-d does not listen to prayers because He already knows them in advance (Gd knows everything).</p>\n\n<p>The characteristics such as wisdom are like the ones found in the Bible. Because the Torah (as Rabbi Ishmael says, it [Torah] “speaks in the language people use,”). It follows that he Torah was written for (in) human language (understanding,) thus we should not take G-d’s emotions literally (G-d has no emotions). It follows that G-d does not really becomes angry when you miss the mark and make a sin. Yet G-d’s wisdom (or chachmah) cannot be compared. Think of our DNA. Someone had to be very intelligent to create that. “For your ways are not My ways,” says Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than put G-d to an image (humanly) we should try and imitate Hashem. G-d gave us the mitzvahs for this very purpose. When one studies Torah, they experience perfection. You could boil it down some more. Man has a purpose. This is what is meant when we say the Will of G-d. King David primary insisted that the world gives praise anthropomorphically to G-d. That is, that our praise should reflect the impressive brilliance of the design and magnificence of the world. That is to our understanding of Him. Maimonides says, “In accordance with one’s knowledge [of G-d] is one’s love of G-d.” Thus, we should center our praise to the Name of Hashem because we cannot know anything about G-d except for what G-d is not (G-d has no body and is one). All we can know is G-d's creations, natural law. Therefore, people should develop their intellect and learn from the laws of nature (science). For example, when the Bible speaks about the parable of G-d talking to Moshe, it is to be understood that people cannot fathom the divine, but see His back after He passes. It is referring to the impact of natural law that G-d created. </p>\n\n<p>For “Man cannot know Me while alive.” Thus, we can only praise G-d through His name, acts, and fame. Though we cannot picture an image of letters while praising. We should not draw an image of G-d in our head. G-d should not be a person, a character, or an angel when we pray rather, G-d should be viewed as nothing because G-d does not exist. In other words, G-d is beyond the domain of existence. In order for G-d to exist, He would have to be made of some kind of material or substance, and hence a form that can be discovered. (Abraham discovered G-d by studying the heaven but this is metaphorical). G-d's essence is nothing, so you can and should picture nothing when you pray.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who is more truthful in the Garden of Eden Story, God or the Serpent?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Garden of Eden Story is very complex and it seems to me that both the Serpent and God fall short of telling the absolute truth. </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 2:16-17</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טז  וַיְצַו יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים, עַל-הָאָדָם לֵאמֹר:  מִכֹּל עֵץ-הַגָּן, אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל. 16 </p>\n  \n  <p>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: 'Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;</p>\n  \n  <p>יז  וּמֵעֵץ, הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע--לֹא תֹאכַל, מִמֶּנּוּ:  כִּי, בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְךָ מִמֶּנּוּ--מוֹת תָּמוּת.   17 </p>\n  \n  <p>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God tells man that <strong>on the day</strong> he eats of the tree he will surely die. We know later on that he lives for almost a thousand years. Eve seems to be reading the verse the way I'm describing as she is even afraid to touch the tree for fear of death.</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 3:2-3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב  וַתֹּאמֶר הָאִשָּׁה, אֶל-הַנָּחָשׁ:  מִפְּרִי עֵץ-הַגָּן, נֹאכֵל.</p>\n  \n  <p>2 And the woman said unto the serpent: 'Of the fruit of the trees of\n  the garden we may eat;</p>\n  \n  <p>ג  וּמִפְּרִי הָעֵץ, אֲשֶׁר בְּתוֹךְ-הַגָּן--אָמַר אֱלֹהִים לֹא\n  תֹאכְלוּ מִמֶּנּוּ, וְלֹא תִגְּעוּ בּוֹ:  פֶּן-תְּמֻתוּן.</p>\n  \n  <p>3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,\n  God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest\n  ye die.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Serpent seems to be hinting that the fruit won't kill her in the way that she thinks, and adds another reason why God wouldn't want her or Adam to eat from the tree.</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 3:4-5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד  וַיֹּאמֶר הַנָּחָשׁ, אֶל-הָאִשָּׁה:  לֹא-מוֹת, תְּמֻתוּן.</p>\n  \n  <p>4 And the serpent said unto the woman: 'Ye shall not surely die;</p>\n  \n  <p>ה  כִּי, יֹדֵעַ אֱלֹהִים, כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְכֶם מִמֶּנּוּ, וְנִפְקְחוּ עֵינֵיכֶם; וִהְיִיתֶם, כֵּאלֹהִים, יֹדְעֵי, טוֹב וָרָע.</p>\n  \n  <p>5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Serprent brings a new concept to the table, the idea that God might actually be afraid of Adam and Eve if they eat of the tree. The Serpent's words end up being true as the story ends with God seeming to be afraid of Adam and Eve for the exact reason that the serpent gave, that Adam and Eve had become like God. God never spoke of this being an issue to Adam and Eve, and yet it's the sole reason God speaks of when He evicts Adam and Eve from the garden.</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 3:22-23</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כב  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים, הֵן הָאָדָם הָיָה כְּאַחַד מִמֶּנּוּ,\n  לָדַעַת, טוֹב וָרָע; וְעַתָּה פֶּן-יִשְׁלַח יָדוֹ, וְלָקַח גַּם מֵעֵץ\n  הַחַיִּים, וְאָכַל, וָחַי לְעֹלָם.</p>\n  \n  <p>22 And the LORD God said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to\n  know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also\n  of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.'</p>\n  \n  <p>כג  וַיְשַׁלְּחֵהוּ יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים, מִגַּן-עֵדֶן--לַעֲבֹד,\n  אֶת-הָאֲדָמָה, אֲשֶׁר לֻקַּח, מִשָּׁם.</p>\n  \n  <p>23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to\n  till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And before anyone here tries to say that Adam and Eve died later and so God wasn't lying, you need to give proof of this. Because if Adam and Eve were already immortal before being commanded not to eat of the forbidden fruit, then what good is the tree of life?

    "title": "When can the brother of a man who died childless do neither yibbum nor chalitzah?",
    "content": "# When can the brother of a man who died childless do neither yibbum nor chalitzah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was under the impression that if a man dies childless and has a brother, then the brother must do either <em>yibbum</em> (marrying his wife) or <em>chalitzah</em> (rejecting the marriage) -- his choice, but he has to do one or the other and the widow can't remarry until he does.  But then I read in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.2.2?lang=bi&with=Sanhedrin&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 2:2</a> that the king does neither:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The king] may not perform halitzah, nor may others perform halitzah for his wife. He may not contract levirate marriage nor may his brothers contract levirate marriage with his wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>mishna</em> goes on to discuss that it's to his merit if he nonetheless does one of these, but others say we don't listen to him if he wants to.  Either way, that sounds optional -- it's <em>meritorious</em> for him to do either <em>yibbum</em> or <em>chalitzah</em>, but he doesn't have to.</p>\n\n<p>Is this the <em>halacha</em>?  If so, are there other cases where a brother can simply not act at all, neither <em>yibbum</em> nor <em>chalitzah</em>, within the law, leaving the woman as an <em>aguna</em> - unable to get married?</p>\n\n<p>I did not find clarification in the <em>g'mara</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara addresses this in 19b, and Rashi there explains the mishna; he says the issue here is that yibbum and chalitzah both clash with the obligation of a king's honor. Chalitza -- to have him summoned before the court and for someone to spit in front of him; yibbum (<em>this is cool!</em>) -- for him to say \"I'm filling in for my dead brother\" ... the king should never appear to be anyone's \"understudy.\"</p>\n<p>The default, then, is that the obligation of a king's honor precludes either possibility. Rabbi Yehudah is of the opinion that the king may then <em>choose</em> to waive that obligation, at which point nothing is standing in his way of yibbum/chalitzah. The Sages opine that the matter is out of his hands:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא חולץ ולא חולצין וכו':  איני והאמר רב אשי אפילו למאן דאמר נשיא שמחל על כבודו כבודו מחול מלך שמחל על כבודו אין כבודו מחול שנאמר (דברים יז) שום תשים עליך מלך שתהא אימתו עליך מצוה שאני:</p>\n<p>[R. Yehudah allows the king to waive his honor and then do yibbum/chalitzah] -- Really?! But Rav Ashi said: <em>Even according to the opinion that a chief rabbi may successfully waive his honor, a king who attempts to waive his honor may not do so, as Deut. 17 obligates us to \"firmly emplace a king\", i.e. you must be in awe of him</em>! [R. Yehudah would reply that] it's different [i.e. he may choose to forgo his honor] when it's a mitzvah [situation].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just to hash out the consequences here: if there's an additional surviving brother, let that one do yibbum/chalitzah and then the widow can get on with her life. If the king is the only surviving brother, then yes it's a sad situation that the widow can't remarry; but then again you saw in that Mishna that a king's widow is also not allowed to remarry. In short, the national interest in a leader figure overrides those concerns.</p>\n<p>There are cases in which there's no obligation for yibbum/chalitzah (e.g. Joe's paternal half-brother married his maternal half-sister); but what's happening here is that there is an obligation, but it's overridden by external halachic factors. No different, I suppose, than the following cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The brother had previously sworn not to get within twenty feet of any woman in that family</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There was some weird life-or-death medical issue preventing both yibbum and chalitzh [suppose either of them has a horrible contagious disease]</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Or just to use the Gemara's example, if the surviving brother is a chief rabbi, according to the opinions that he can't waive his honor either.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a broader question that's debated -- is yibbum/chalitzah simply the mechanism to allow the widow to remarry, or is it an all-out obligation? Suppose she's 90 years old and has zero interest in remarrying. But I don't think that's your case either.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/53019/what-should-a-woman-who-can-only-do-chalitza-do-if-her-yevam-cant-do-it/89866?r=SearchResults&s=1%7C7.7918#89866\">this answer</a> a man with amputated legs above the knee cannot do <em>Chalitza</em> and would normally have to do <em>Yibbum</em> whether sefaradi or ashkenazi.

If a vessel's exterior becomes <em>tamei</em> from <em>tamei</em> liquids, we say that its interior remains <em>tahor</em>; this makes it obvious that this is Rabbinic <em>tumah</em>.</p>\n<p>In mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.25.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">25:9</a>, we see that this distinction doesn't apply for vessels used for <em>kodashim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כְּלֵי הַקֹּדֶשׁ אֵין לָהֶם אֲחוֹרַיִם וָתוֹךְ, וְאֵין לָהֶם בֵּית צְבִיעָה.</p>\n<p>Utensils used for holy things do not have reverse side and interior, and do not have a finger-hold.

Yom Tov? Celebrating? Repenting? Feeling generous? Bring a Korban! </p>\n\n<p>If the general population gets to a point of <em>Rabbinical Tumah</em> we have to worry that they aren't being sufficiently careful, so we declare it all Tameh.</p>\n\n<p>Since kohanim are more attuned to Tumah issues, we can rely on them knowing the difference between the various level of Tumah.</p>\n\n<p>And since these are Rabbinic enaction you will find all sorts of inconsistencies; some by design, others because \" here they saw for to decree, and there, not.\".</p>\n\n<p>As to your 2nd point they one may \"<em>burn kodashim that is Biblically tahor (but Rabbinically tamei).</em>\" - keep in mind that they wouldn't burn these Rabbinic-Tameh-Kodashim (Korbanot) immediately; they would wait until they were past their expiration date, and therefore had to be burnt anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

To be a better father to my kids, I'm trying to see what educational methods does G-d exercise in the Torah to His sons when they misbehave.</p>\n<p>As we can see the Torah testifies that the Jews weren't very obedient, to say the least. And G-d reacted to they misdeeds very promptly. Strangely, it appears to come down to two methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>G-d gets furious and kills his naughty sons immediately or He tells others (Moses, other nations, plagues) to kill them. E.g. the Golden Calf, Aharon's sons, Korach, Mekoshesh, Bnot Moav, Meraglim, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>1.5. G-d gets \"less furious\" and promises to kill them later - Dor Hamidbar, Moses and Aharon (for Mei Meriva and Golden Calf)</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>G-d overcomes His anger and postpones killing them or pardons them completely (called mercy) - Golden Calf, Kivrot Teavah etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What additional methods of dealing with disobedient sons does G-d demonstrate in the Torah alone?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you missed the most important ones - training through experience, natural consequences, and guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that we do see examples of Divine discipline, and we also need to learn from that, but that is not what education is built on.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n\n<p>Expelling Adam from Gan Eden - forcing self-development when instuction was not heeded. God does not kill him, but sends him out on his own to learn about life the hard way.</p>\n\n<p>Giving the Torah - instuction, showing intent, and warning of consequences, both natural consequences and discipline.</p>\n\n<p>Forty years in the desert - something between a \"time-out\" and a guided contemplation, giving lots of time for the old to pass and for new attituted to develop.</p>\n\n<p>See also Rabbis S. R. Hirsch's Nineteen Letters, specifically <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nineteen_Letters.5?ven=Bernard_Drachman_translation,_1899&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Letter 5</a>, which present a educational approach of Judaism on the societal level.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Goldstein in the book \"<a href=\"https://israelbookshoppublications.com/products/upgrade\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Upgrade</a>\" (Hebrew version שמע בני) points out that the kind of actions the OP notes in his question have been prevalent in the <em>closed</em> education system. Which stated that certain things were forbidden often without an explanation given. It was done because many students did not understand the explanations or were not able to make necessary distinctions when applying them. Traditional closed education system informed a student about boundaries. It required a student to be absolutely obedient and the word of authority was always final. Thus, such a student would have to struggle often when his own logic and experience would go against those of the authority.</p>\n<p>A new <em>friendly</em> system of education became prevalent more recently, which focuses more on explanations and rationale. It has been developed in response to the attitude that people were willing to break even most severe prohibitions and \"face\" the consequences. The friendly education also seeks to enforce boundaries by building them over time as the student grows. It is more personalized and takes into account a student's maturity level. There is also danger that the student may not learn at all and get trapped in asking questions. While there is a need for some degree of coercion it cannot be used as means of Chinuch especially in younger years, as the teenagers tend to rebell against being coerced for no reason.</p>\n<p>There are many more interesting points of Chinuch discussed by the author.</p>\n<p>As far as the text of the Torah goes, both types of approach can be found in the Torah text. When it comes to stories of the <em>avos</em> and their trials, how Hashem rebuked kings and warned enemies from harming them - that is an example of the <em>friendly</em> approach. Characteristically, the beginning of the story of Akkeida, where Hashem was preparing Avraham with many words as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.55.7?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 55:7</a> teaches</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He said: Please take your son…” – He said to him: ‘I plead with you, “please take your son.”’ He said to Him: ‘I have two sons, which son?’ He said to him: “Your only one.” He said to him: ‘This one is the only one to his mother, and the other one is the only one to his mother.’ He said to him: “Whom you love” (Genesis 22:2). He said to him: ‘Are there partitions in one’s innards?’ He said to him: “Isaac” (Genesis 22:2). Why did He not reveal it [His intention] to him immediately? It was to endear it [God’s command] in his eyes, and [also] to give him reward for each and every statement. This is like the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Go you [from your land]” (Genesis 12:1) – meaning your district; “from your birthplace” (Genesis 12:1) – meaning your neighborhood; “from your father’s house” (Genesis 12:1) – meaning your father’s house; “to the land that I will show you” (Genesis 12:1). Why did He not reveal it [His intention] to him immediately? It was to endear it [God’s command] in his eyes and to give him reward for each and every statement and for each and every step.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the collective punishments in the desert appear similar to the <em>closed</em> system as everyone received the same punishment as we see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 10:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The spies who spread an evil report of their visit to Canaan have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And those men who spread the evil report about the land died by plague before the Lord” (Numbers 14:37). “And…died” indicates in this world; “by plague” indicates for the World-to-Come. The members of the generation of the wilderness have no share in the World-to-Come and will not stand in judgment, as it is stated: “In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die” (Numbers 14:35). “They shall be consumed” indicates in this world; “and there they shall die” indicates for the World-to-Come; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: The members of the generation of the wilderness were essentially righteous, and about them the verse says: “Gather My pious together to Me, those that have entered into My covenant by offering” (Psalms 50:5). It is they who entered into the covenant with God and they will certainly be rewarded in the future. The assembly of Korah is not destined to arise for resurrection, as it is stated: “And the earth closed upon them” (Numbers 16:33), meaning in this world, and also: “And they perished from among the assembly” (Numbers 16:33), meaning in the World-to-Come; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: About them the verse says: “The Lord kills and makes alive; He lowers to the grave, and raises” (I Samuel 2:6), indicating that the assembly of Korah has a share in the World-to-Come. The ten tribes are not destined to return to Eretz Yisrael, even during the messianic era, as it is stated: “And He cast them into another land, as it is this day” (Deuteronomy 29:27). Just as the day passes never to return, so too, the ten tribes go into exile and do not return; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: “As it is this day,” meaning just as the day darkens and then the sky brightens the next day, with regard to the ten tribes as well, although it is dark for them now, so it is destined to brighten for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do Rabbis get punished in Heaven for wrong interpretations or claims?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I had a Zchus of serving a great Rabbi Z\"l here in Jerusalem who wrote lots of books on Torah as well as on Halacha and Shu\"t. I helped him publishing his books for a decade and for his last years I was driving him to various medical procedures out of town and we had a lot of time to talk.</p>\n\n<p>He revealed to me that he was afraid of Yom Hadin, that some of his interpretations or Shu\"tim might be wrong (in the eyes of Hashem I suppose). He also added that this fear was constantly guarding him in his writings. </p>\n\n<p>We know that many passages in Horayos or Makos deal with wrong [court or Halachic] judgments. So I would really <strong>like to focus on Torah interpretations or non-Halachic statements</strong>. For example, interpreting Maase Bereishit, Torah characters intentions, anatomical or scientific facts, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Does such a concept exist - that G-d punishes Rabbis for wrong interpretations or claims?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=57&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 57a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כדתניא שמעון העמסוני ואמרי לה נחמיה העמסוני היה דורש כל אתין שבתורה כיון שהגיע לאת ה' אלהיך תירא פירש אמרו לו תלמידיו רבי כל אתין שדרשת מה תהא עליהם אמר להם כשם שקבלתי שכר על הדרישה כך קבלתי על הפרישה עד שבא רבי עקיבא ולימד את ה' אלהיך תירא לרבות תלמידי חכמים</p>\n  \n  <p>As it was taught: Simeon the Imsonite — others state, Nehemiah the\n  Imsonite, — interpreted every eth in the Torah, but as soon as he came to, thou shalt fear [eth] the\n  Lord thy God, he refrained. Said his disciples to him, ‘Master, what is to happen with all the ethin\n  which you have interpreted?’ ‘Just as I received reward for interpreting [them],’ he replied: ‘so do I\n  receive reward for retracting.’ Subsequently R. Akiba came and taught: Thou shalt fear [eth] the\n  Lord thy God, that is to include scholars.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here the tanna acknowledges that he had made thousands of incorrect interpretations. Yet not only does he not think he's going to get punished for them, he thinks he gets rewarded for them!</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we might also derive from this case that there are some exceptions. Rashi explains why the tanna refrained from expounding the \"eth\" in the verse about fearing the Lord:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שירא לרבות שום דבר להשוותו למורא המקום</p>\n  \n  <p>For he was afraid to include anything to equate it with fear of the Omnipresent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like the tanna was <em>afraid</em> of giving an incorrect interpretation, but not because it was incorrect <em>per se</em>; rather because it would be incorrect in a way which dishonors God. Thus, there may be a distinction between incorrect interpretations that have negative ramifications, and incorrect interpretations that are merely incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>This might also be supported by another Talmudic passage:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=96b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Shabbat 96b</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר מקושש זה צלפחד וכן הוא אומר ויהיו בני ישראל במדבר וימצאו איש וגו' ולהלן הוא אומר אבינו מת במדבר מה להלן צלפחד אף כאן צלפחד דברי ר' עקיבא אמר לו ר' יהודה בן בתירא עקיבא בין כך ובין כך אתה עתיד ליתן את הדין אם כדבריך התורה כיסתו ואתה מגלה אותו ואם לאו אתה מוציא לעז על אותו צדיק</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: The gatherer was Zelophehad. And thus it is said, and while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man [gathering sticks, etc.];  whilst elsewhere it is said, our father died in the wilderness; just as there Zelophehad [is meant], so here too Zelophehad [is meant]: this is R. Akiba's view. Said R. Judah b. Bathyra to him, 'Akiba! in either case you will have to give an account [for your statement]: if you are right, the Torah shielded  him, while you reveal him; and if not, you cast a stigma upon a righteous man.'</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_96.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here it sounds like the objection to R. Akiva's interpretation is not merely that it is incorrect, but that it is incorrect in a way which slanders a righteous individual. This might indicate that if an interpretation is incorrect in an innocuous way then the interpreting rabbi will not face any repercussions for the rogue interpretation. </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to mistakes in actual halacha, it would seem that there might be more to worry about. For instance, the Talmud strongly cautions people against being involved in matters of marriage and divorce:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 13a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל כל שאינו יודע בטיב גיטין וקדושין לא יהא לו עסק עמהן אמר ר' אסי אמר רבי יוחנן וקשין לעולם יותר מדור המבול</p>\n  \n  <p>Again they sat and related: In reference to Rab Judah's statement\n  in Rab's name, [that] one who does not know the peculiar nature of divorce and betrothal should\n  have no business with them, R. Assi said in R. Johanan's name: And they are more harmful to the\n  world than the generation of the flood, </p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a Mishnah in Berachot (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=28b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">28b</a>) we are told how R. Nechunia would pray that he would not make a mistake in his halachic rulings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' נחוניא בן הקנה היה מתפלל בכניסתו לבית המדרש וביציאתו תפלה קצרה אמרו לו מה מקום לתפלה זו אמר להם בכניסתי אני מתפלל שלא יארע דבר תקלה על ידי וביציאתי אני נותן הודאה על חלקי</p>\n  \n  <p>R. NEHUNIA B. HA-KANEH USED TO SAY A PRAYER AS HE ENTERED THE BETH HA-MIDRASH AND AS HE LEFT IT — A SHORT PRAYER. THEY SAID TO HIM: WHAT SORT OF PRAYER IS THIS? HE REPLIED: WHEN I ENTER I PRAY THAT NO OFFENCE SHOULD OCCUR THROUGH ME,3  AND WHEN I LEAVE I EXPRESS THANKS FOR MY LOT.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Soncino translation, capitals in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud there cites a Beraita elaborating about what this prayer actually is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר בכניסתו מהו אומר יהי רצון מלפניך ה' אלהי שלא יארע דבר תקלה על ידי ולא אכשל בדבר הלכה וישמחו בי חברי ולא אומר על טמא טהור ולא על טהור טמא ולא יכשלו חברי בדבר הלכה ואשמח בהם</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: On entering what does a man  say? 'May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that no offence may occur through me, and that I may not err in a matter of halachah and that my colleagues may rejoice in me and that I may not call unclean clean or clean unclean, and that my colleagues may not err in a matter of halachah and that I may rejoice in them'.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in the Talmud, judges are warned to imagine the danger they are in by possibly ruling incorrectly:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=7&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 7a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר רבי שמואל בר נחמני אמר רבי יונתן לעולם יראה דיין עצמו כאילו חרב מונחת לו בין ירכותיו וגיהנם פתוחה לו מתחתיו שנאמר שנאמר הנה מטתו שלשלמה ששים גבורים סביב לה מגבורי ישראל כולם אחוזי חרב מלומדי מלחמה איש חרבו על יריכו מפחד בלילות מפחדה של גיהנם שדומה ללילה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Samuel b. Nahmani further said, reporting R. Jonathan: A judge should always think of  himself as if he had a sword hanging over his head  and Gehenna  gaping under him, for it is written, <em>Behold, it is the litter of Solomon</em> [symbolically the <em>Shechinah</em>], <em>and round about it three score of the mighty men of Israel</em> [symbolising the scholars]; <em>they all handle the sword and are expert in war</em> [in debates] <em>and every man has his sword upon his flank because of the dread in the night</em>. [the dread of Gehenna, which is likened unto night]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_7.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The implication here seems to be that if the judge rules incorrectly, he will be subjected to \"the sword\" and \"Gehenna\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Avot 4:13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר, הֱוֵי זָהִיר בַּתַּלְמוּד, שֶׁשִּׁגְגַת תַּלְמוּד עוֹלָה זָדוֹן.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Judah said: be careful in study, for an error in study counts as deliberate sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bartenura ad loc:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם תִּטְעֶה בְּהוֹרָאָה מִתּוֹךְ שֶׁלֹּא דִּקְדַּקְתָּ בְּתַלְמוּדְךָ וְתָבֹא לְהַתִּיר אֶת הָאָסוּר, הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מַעֲלֶה עַל יָדְךָ כְּאִלּוּ עָשִׂיתָ מֵזִיד:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>If you err in a legal decision from your not being exact in your study, and you come to permit the forbidden; the Holy One, blessed be He, considers it for you as if you had done it intentionally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If one were to claim there is only one interpretation of the biblical text, and that they alone know the exact biblical meaning of the verse or passage, it is a general rule that the claimants are ignorant of other interpretations.[1] For example, many of the sages argued about their convictions in opposition. Yet their criterion may be rooted in a phrase that the rabbis often taught,  (paraphrased) “That originally there was one Torah view. Arguments only arose out of man’s ignorance.” However, from man's ignorance, we get a wealth of views that are not necessary credence, but equally tenable. Although not every view is harmonious, we should respect all views for there is no consensus on matters of interpretation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Different interpretations of Genesis 49:10</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thus, the Midrash Numbers Rabbah 13 reports that “there are seventy faces to the\nTorah.” Frequently, the translation differs from scholar to scholar. For instance, take the meaning of Jacob's statement in Genesis 49:10. This statement is disputed amongst the commentators. Jacob gives a prophecy to his son Judah, “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the staff from between his legs;\nad ki yavo shilo, the obedience of the people shall be his.” Many commentators feel that Jacob is prophesying the fall of Judah, the tribe of Judah. Others see “scepter” and “staff,” as symbolic terms for kingship. Jacob says the kingship will last until, “ad ki yavo shilo.” That is until shilo comes. What does this mean? Rashbam felt shilo was referring to the city of Shilo in the kingdom of Judah. He relates to Kings’ David and Solomon and expressed that in reign 0f Rehovam, the northern ten tribes of Israel would rebel. This will occur when Rehovam enters the city of Shilo in a failed attempt to solidify his regime. But Chizkunee felt that Ahiyah came from Shilo and it is not that Rehovam came to Shilo. He interprets this passage to be speaking of the Davidic line but insists that the prophecy speaks of a time when the prophet Ahiyah left Shilo. That is when Ahiyah ripped his clothes in front of Jerovam. </p>\n\n<p>David Kimchi (Radak) sees shilo as “David’s son,” or “afterbirth.” Joseph ibn Kaspi said no, it means “error” and the king is Zedekiah. It is speaking about the end of the Judean king (II Samuel 6:7). He posits that yavo does not mean “come” but “occur,” and that the word “until” denotes the end of the reign. Jacob is prophesying the Davidic kings until (ad) this occurs (yavo) in error (shilo). King  Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon, and “Judah was carried away captive out of the land” (II Kings 25:21). Yet Abraham ibn Ezra opted for the former and not the latter. That the city is Shilo, but the prophecy is talking about the beginning of the Davidic line. He reads yavo as the “end” or “destruction” in relation to Samuel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was Jacob talking about the Messianic age?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Remarkably, Saadiah felt that shilo denotes shelo, “his” and that the prediction is predicting the coming of the Messiah. Midrash Genesis Rabbah, Midrashim, the Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 98b, Targum Onkelos, Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Targum Neophyti, Saadiah, Rashi, and Nachmanides all agree with this. Contrary to their thinking, Sforno was convinced that shilo means “boundary” or “peace,” that ad ki yavo shilo denotes a time when the State of Israel will be reestablished after the Hasmoneans kings and diaspora. Jacob was, therefore, informing his son about a period when Israel will set a boundary for the coming of the Messiah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>From the analysis above, it is safe to assume that there are many divergent opinions about Genesis 49:10. Indeed, the Midrash is correct when it says, “there are seventy faces to the Torah.” There is no set belief of dogma; it is not an all or nothing acceptance. It is not that there is one prevailing view over the other. Jews can believe whatever they what. They can hold conflicting views, regardless of the majority. What matters most is behavior. Following the mitzvahs and having a firm belief in the oneness of G-d. Other than that, people are free to accept or reject what fits their worldview so long as it conforms to the rules of morality and corresponds to religion. Even well-respected rabbis tend to disagree on certain interpretations. The endless volumes of debates found in the Talmud(s) validate this claim. We see from here that Jews can hold dissenting views because Judaism allows for a variety of opinions. As the saying goes “Two Jews, three opinions.” </p>\n\n<p>Thus, it is inconvincible to imagine that G-d would punish or even condemn anyone for their opinion or nonconforming beliefs in matters of interpretation. For if this were so, then one would have to imagine that the majority of rabbis listed here are not in heaven — G-d forbid!</p>\n\n<p>[1] This does not validate Jesus's claim to divinity in the Torah because that would be contrary to the spirit of the text.</p>\n\n\n",

However, he's inclined to think that the term \"mitzvah\" is generic and includes commandments that we <strong>must</strong> do because G-d commanded them such as eating kosher, observing Shabbat, etc. It includes commandments that are both between man and G-d as well as those between man and neighbor.</p>\n\n<p>\"Ma'asim Tovim\", the rav feels, refers only to deeds between man and his neighbor that go above and beyond what the Torah commands. For example, the Torah does not command visiting the sick. Doing so is a \"mitzvah\" (offhand, not sure which ones) but it would also be considered a \"good deed\" (ma'aseh tov.)</p>\n\n\n",

Is it reasonable to say if one no longer places faith in Ad---i one loses it? Is a Jewish atheist much of a Jew, with respect to how the faith interprets it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In this short answer, I have broken up the answer into tow parts for clarity. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Part One</strong></p>\n\n<p>You ask, \"If a human gains a Jewish soul at conversion\" - there needs a correction. Non-Jews do not gain anything. If so, did Abraham have a “lesser” soul then Moses? Is the convert a new kind of man? Is G-d tribal, caring less for all the rest?[1]</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Jew does not possess a special soul. Gentiles share the same soul. His conversion adds nothing new. Ovadia Yosef may have held some disdain for gentiles but Ruth was a gentile who converted and Kings’ David and Solomon, as well as the Messiah, will descend from her. We see from here that gentiles have the same capacity to become the greatest leaders as those who are born to Jewish parents.[2]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part Two</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jews cannot convert back to Judaism. Once you are born (or converted) you are always a Jew and will die a Jew. This is why it is imperative to (at first) drive away future converts because once one coverts, you cannot leave the faith. </p>\n\n<p>In Judaism there is a concept about the neshama yesara; that is, an additional soul added for Shabbos in order that we shall channel our energies toward G-d. So even if you break Shabbat; G-d forbid, the soul remains the same but, there is no addition soul unless you keep it. Is that a good incentive? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Simply put, there is no better birthright, only accomplishments. Once a Jew is born (or a gentile converts), he keeps the same soul . Likewise, Once a gentile converts, he keeps the same Torah as a Jew.[3] Thus, all people, are created equal.[4]</p>\n\n<p>[1] See (Deut. 4:6-8).</p>\n\n<p>[2] See (Numb. 15:16).</p>\n\n<p>[3] Talmud Sanhedrin 59a states: “A gentile who studies Torah is akin to a High Priest.”</p>\n\n<p>[4] Talmud (Shavuos 39a) does not say that Converts have a Jewish soul. It says, “future generations of Jews, and gentiles who will eventually convert, are also part of G-d’s covenant.”</p>\n\n<p>See Maimonides, \"Guide for the Perplexed\", and Saadia Gaon's \"The Book of Beliefs and Opinions\" for more information.</p>\n\n\n",

Hence He is immutable in every respect, as He expressly declares, \"I, the Lord, do not change\" (Mal. 3:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>– Part 1, Chapter 11, verse 2.</p>\n\n<p>And G-d is, “the stable one who undergoes no manner of change…nor a change in His relation to what is other than Himself” - Guide 1:11 (emphasis added). Yet some acts are not even commanded in the Torah but the rabbis made them as to show love of G-d. Moshe said you cannot add to the law. But these rabbis weren’t adding. These expressions are the divine Will. The rabbis have derived these acts through celebration and delving into the Torah with deep study (immersed in Torah study). But these exquisite commands are not alluded nor nuance in text. They are sensed. Take for instance the rabbinical enactments, safeguards, customs and embellishments (hiddur mitzvah). The community also sends gifts and food on Purim, not a biblical law found the Torah. We eat fruits on Tu B’Shvat, and even celebrate (dance) with the Torah when finished reading.  Nevertheless G-d expects us add fences to the biblical laws. For instance, an eye for an eye is to mean compensation as in payment. </p>\n\n<p>Another example are the sacrifices. G-d neither needs nor wants sacrifices, and only allowed it because people in ancient times felt differently. It is a concession to human needs. The Rambam also states that this is not only his view but is the view of the prophets.</p>\n\n<p>  We can add that the ancient rabbis around 70 CE when the temple was destroyed also felt that sacrifices were unnecessary. Therefore when the temple was destroyed, they did not seek a way to continue sacrifices. It would have been easy for them to do so if they felt it was necessary.   </p>\n\n<p>Of course, as is to be expected, many rabbis disagreed. We still have many references in the siddur praying for the restoration of sacrifices. But the siddur is a compendium of many often conflicting ideas, which prompt us to think and to remember the past. </p>\n\n<p>In the Babylonian Talmud, Nidah 61b, Rabbi Joseph says: “The mitzvot [commandments] will be abolished in the time to come (WtC).” Apparently, rabbis’ Abraham and Joshua Flak are in agreement. In his Sefer Ha-ikkarim, 14th-century rabbi Joseph Albo says that a future prophet may abolish or nullify all of the biblical commands except for the Decalogue, given that he has authority from Hashem. That is to say, he may do away with the Mosaic law if G-d’s voice is heard again under the canopy of six-hundred thousand people as was in the event at Sinai. </p>\n\n<p>  Is this person whom Albo is speaking of lives in the future Messianic earth? Maimonides said that nothing miraculous will happen except that all non-Jews will become Jews. So it appears that some say all the laws will be abolished because there will be no need for repairs. Yet others say that if a future prophet appears and claims to nullify the laws, Hashem must grant him authority first. Though Albo thinks this unlikely, he leaves room for its possibility.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if a prophet were to announce his prophethood to be greater then Moshe or in another country, or not at all, and whether or not he is the Moshiach, s/he must first find approval from Hashem in order to abolish or nullify the Mosaic laws (Mitzvos).</p>\n\n<p>This in no way entails that Jesus (generally acclaimed to be the Messiah by Christians) or Muhammad (customarily declared to be the final prophet by Muslims) meet the requirements expressed by the views of R. Albo or Maimonides as neither of the two candidates advocate to be a good predecessor to Moshe Rabbeinu in front of mass witnesses (six-hundred thousand people) to proclaim that this is the new Will of G-d. As noted above, G-d does not change His Will but allows certain laws (sacrifices) in place of human needs, which may be removed when humanity is ready to progress.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the penalty for raping (or seducing) an unmarried non virgin girl in \"Halaca\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105856/are-deuteronomy-2228-29-regading-oneis-and-exodus-2215-16-regarding-mefateh-re/105867\">this question</a>, the penalty for seducing or raping a virgin is 50 shekels + pain damage and other torts + mandatory marriage.  The bible has 2 verses dealing with raping a virgin but does not talk about non-virgins.</p>\n\n<p>What happens if a man rapes or seduces a non-virgin?  Are the penalties different?</p>\n\n<p>Some mentioned that Jewish justice is more restorative than punitive. So a girl losing virginity or her father deserves some compensatory damage.  What happens in the case where that damage has already been done?  Does he still pay the other damages (pain, mandatory marriage, etc)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Basically -- there's the added, special, 50-shekel penalty for the specific cases mentioned by the Torah, <em>on top</em> of standard torts. The 50 is not actually the \"loss in value\", that's separate.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam, Laws of Maidens Ch. 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א  חמישים כסף של קנס, הם דמי הנאת שכיבה בלבד.  וחייב המפתה ליתן בושת ופגם, יתר על הקנס הקצוב בתורה; יתר עליו האונס, שהוא נותן את הצער:  שהנבעלת ברצונה, אין לה צער; ואנוסה, יש לה צער--וכן הוא אומר באנוסה \"תחת אשר עינה\" (דברים כב,כט).  [ב] נמצא המפתה משלם שלושה דברים--קנס, ובושת, ופגם; והאונס, ארבעה--קנס, ובושת, ופגם, וצער.</p>\n  \n  <p>ב  [ג] קנס, שווה בכול; אחד הבא על בת כוהן גדול, ואחד הבא על בת גר או ממזרת--קנסה חמישים כסף.  אבל הבושת והפגם והצער--אינן שווין בכול, וצריכין שומה.</p>\n  \n  <p>The 50 shekels of penalty are for the enjoyment alone. The seducer would have to pay for embarrassment and reduced-value, in addition to the penalty fixed by the Torah. The rapist would pay more, to include pain -- as one who consents isn't entitled to pain money, whereas one is raped does, as Deu. 22:29 states -- <em>because he afflicted her</em>. Thus: the seducer pays penalty, embarrassment, and damages; while the rapist pays four: penalty, embarrassment, damages, and pain.</p>\n  \n  <p>The penalty is the same for all, whether victim was the High Priest's daughter or the daughter of a convert or the product of adultery -- the penalty is fifty shekels. Embarrassment, loss-of-value, and pain vary, and thus must be estimated case-by-case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Long story short: if you break someone's arm, you have to pay all sorts of tort damages. (Damage [i.e. loss of value], pain, healing, time-off-work, and embarrassment.) The Torah is <em>adding</em> an additional penalty in particular cases of young virgins, payable to the father. </p>\n\n<p>Let's try to take your cases one by one; some of these are spelled out if you keep reading that chapter:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Victim is not a virgin: the 50-shekel penalty doesn't apply; nor is there \"loss in value\"; there remains embarrassment in all cases, plus pain if it was a rape. (Mind you, if there's any trauma then there will be all sorts of bills for that too! But we're assuming for the sake of the argument that there isn't.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Victim is a single adult and was raped: no 50-shekel penalty; she receives all restitution (as her father is no longer her steward). Pain, embarrassment, damage if she was a virgin. (And if there are medical bills or time lost from work -- or say she was a non-virgin divorcee but now the rape is reducing her ability to function -- all that would be tort as well.) </p></li>\n<li><p>Victim is a single, consenting adult: no money. Still prohibited; the rabbis decreed lashes.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just to conclude -- in most cases today, God forbid, there's going to be some serious healing needed, all of which the assailant must pay. Furthermore, Rambam writes that there may be cases where the courts go beyond strict halacha to prevent society descending into chaos; if a billionaire thinks he can go around raping people and just writing off million-dollar checks afterwards, that's likely a case where the courts would, to use Rambam's language, <em>le'asro bematzor umatzok</em> --  \"incarcerate him in dire straits.\" </p>\n\n\n",

Indeed, a flat leather object that isn't made for sitting/lying (such as a belt) is only susceptible to <em>tumah</em> if it is recognisable as a utensil and serves both a person and their objects (as described in, for example, Kehati's introduction to the <em>masechet</em>).

Ramban, when questioning Rashi, stateed that he does not understand why the word ציצת has a missing yud, which gives gematria 590, rather than 600. Rav Mizrachi answered that it was not a problem because the midrash followed the opinion that the accepted masoretic reading has authority (and can be used to derive halakhos). Tur O\"Ch 24 says, even though it is written <em>hasar</em>, Midrash Tachuma notes that out of 3 times it is written ציצת, in one case it is written לציצת, which adds the value of missing 30. I.e. ציצת, ציצת, לציצת have gematria 590+590+30+590 = 600+600+600, which completes the count.

It’s documentation of an event that already happened. You do not have to amen the blessing because the blessing was actualized in the past. You are not a witness to the blessing when watching a recording, you are a witness to documentation of a past blessing which is fundamentally a different event.

This is perhaps most known in the area of fasting where some authorities exercise some leniency in certain situations. A simple Google or Sefaria search yields some results, the earliest of which I’ve seen is <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Danzig\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chaye Adam</a>. What is the earliest application or usage of this term in the field of <em>halachah</em>?

First, even exceptionally honest relatives can’t testify together or about each other (“even Moses and Aaron”).

Then, R' Chanina, Segan Hakohanim reports that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דּוֹחֶה הָיָה אַבָּא אֶת בַּעֲלֵי מוּמִין מֵעַל גַּבֵּי הַמִּזְבֵּחַ</p>\n<p>My father used to push blemished animals off the altar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Obadiah MiBartenura explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאם עלו דוחה היה אותן כלאחר יד ולא היה מורידן דרך בזיון בפרהסיא</p>\n<p>[Meaning] that if they ascended, he would push them away back-handedly and would not take them down in a degrading way, in public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>(My translation)</sup></p>\n<p>How would one get an animal off of the Altar without it being publicly noticed? The Altar was in the center of the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144586/jewish/The-Holy-Temple.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Temple</a> courtyard and the center of the action there. There was one access point - the open ramp on the south side. Generally, offerings would go up the ramp and be burned at the top, not come down, so I have trouble picturing how an animal could come down that way without being noticed.</p>\n<p>If R' Chanina's father would literally push these animals off one of the other sides of the Altar, I would expect that such a dramatic decent would be even more noticeable, not to mention degrading. Perhaps he shoved them off the west side, where the only lines of sight available were from inside the courtyard, where only Kohanim were?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>My understanding is like the suggestion in your last paragraph, that R.

    "content": "# Source that אמונת חכמים applies to the Sages' knowledge besides Halachah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Tons of Jewish responsa (incl. this site) is based on a common belief/premise that the Talmudic Sages knew what they say and that everything they said is true - אמונת חכמים (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11617/what-is-emunas-chachomim\">this question</a> on this term). While it is difficult to classify all Talmudic statements, I'd like to distinguish between Halachic and factual ones.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Halachic statements</strong> rule Halochos - this thing is Kosher or Mutar or liable, etc. The Sages had the full Heavenly authority to rule the Halochos and we are obligated to follow them, which also includes Hashkafah and Mussar issues (thanks @Micha). This is out of the question.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Factual statements</strong> (this is so and so or this happened so and so) describe the world, its history, and its phenomena. My question is strictly about factual statements, for example \"צלופחד הוא המקושש\" or \"there are billions of stars out there\" or \"snake is pregnant for 7 years\" or \"lice create spontaneously\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We can clearly see from the Talmud itself that the Sages did not accept axiomatically each other's opinions and argued strenuously, frequently relying on common non-Jewish knowledge. I know that this remained disputable and many late Rabbis did not accept many Talmudic statements, Rambam didn't canonize it in his principles, and some of the statements were proven as \"very hard to reconcile with our empirical knowledge\". </p>\n\n<p>But eventually, in common perception, אמונת חכמים was expanded <em>by some</em> to the domain of knowledge also, beyond the realm of Halachah.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know the earliest source for the claim of אמונת חכמים expands to trusting Sages' <strong>knowledge</strong>. Did Tannayim or Amorayim themselves say that their knowledge is absolute and indisputable? Were it Gaonim, Rishonim or Achronim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I like to point out that the Gemara Sotah 4b gives you multiple options on this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר יצחק בר <רב> יוסף א\"ר יוחנן כל אחד ואחד בעצמו שיער והאיכא בן עזאי דלא נסיב איבעית אימא נסיב ופירש הוה ואיבעית אימא מרביה שמיע ליה ואיבעית אימא (תהילים כה) סוד ה' ליראיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Several rabbis were discussing the minimum time that if a woman was secluded with a man, it's possible they had relations; each gave a different answer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Said R. Yitzchak bar Yosef in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: eacho f these rabbis' numbers came from their own [intimate] experience. But what about Ben Azai, who never married?! If you want, you could say he married [briefly], then separated; <strong>if you want, you could say he heard it from his teacher [R. Akiva]</strong>; <strong>and if you want, you could apply Psalms 25 -- <em>G-d gave His secret to those who fear Him</em>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Talmud is giving you the option of believing that his study of \"pure\" Torah mystically imparted him with empirical knowledge that he'd never otherwise know; it also gives you the option to not go there. </p>\n\n<p>By the way that phrase from Psalms was invoked in the vigorous discussion between the late Rabbis Yisrael Shapira and Aharon Lichteinstein zt\"l concerning disengagement from Gaza; if I recall correctly Rabbi Lichtenstein felt it was arrogant for any armchair rabbi today to wield it and claim perfect knowledge of military/political outcomes. </p>\n\n\n",

However, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1363819/jewish/Avadim-Chapter-Nine.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">9:6</a> states that one may not free a Canaanite slave (though if one does, the slave is free). It seems strange to me to go into such detail on how to free a slave if it is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Is it common for the Mishneh Torah to outline how to do something incorrectly?</p>\n\n<p>Is it common for the Mishneh Torah to describe an action as <em>assur</em>, when it is violating a positive commandment, not a negative one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Rambam himself, in the same law (9:6), says that it's permitted to free a slave for the purpose of fulfilling a commandment. Since there are cases that freeing a slave is permitted, the description of how to free a slave can be used for the permitted cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומותר לשחררו לדבר מצוה אפילו למצוה של דבריהם כגון שלא היו עשרה בבית הכנסת ה\"ז משחרר עבדו ומשלים בו המנין וכן כל כיוצא בזה וכן שפחה שנוהגין בה העם מנהג הפקר והרי היא מכשול לחוטאים כופין את רבה ומשחררה כדי שתנשא ויסור המכשול וכן כל כיוצא בזה</p>\n<p>It is permitted to free a slave for the sake of a mitzvah, even a mitzvah of Rabbinic origin - e.g., if ten free men were not present in the synagogue, a person may free his slave to complete the quorum. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. Similarly, if people are treating a person's maid-servant in a licentious manner and she presents a stumbling block to sinful people, we compel her master to free her so that she will marry and thus remove the stumbling block. The same principles apply in all analogous situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the other questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it common for the Mishneh Torah to outline how to do something incorrectly?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that describing forbidden actions is common. For example, the different types of forbidden magic in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912370/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-Eleven.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodat Kochavim 11</a>. Not entirely analogous, but each type of forbidden magic is described for about as long as each way to free a slave.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it common for the Mishneh Torah to describe an action as <em>assur</em>, when it is violating a positive commandment, not a negative one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think it's common. But there is such a thing as a <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%90_%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C_%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">prohibition coming from a positive commandment</a>. Many of them have corresponding negative commandments (e.g. to rest on holidays but also not to do work on holidays). But here is an example of something that the Rambam says is forbidden exclusively from a positive commandment (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960665/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Seventeen.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Issurey Bi'a 17:13</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצות עשה על כהן גדול שישא נערה בתולה ומשתבגור תאסר עליו והוא אשה בבתוליה יקח אשה לא קטנה בבתוליה ולא בוגרת</p>\n<p>It is a positive commandment for a High Priest to marry a virgin maiden. When she reaches the age of maturity, she becomes forbidden to him, as [Leviticus 21:13] states: \"He shall marry a virgin woman.\" \"Woman\" implies that she is not a minor. \"Virgin\" implies that she has not reached maturity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: A refutation of their\n  words that the entire sphere moves can be derived from the fact that\n  we have never found the constellation of Ursa Major in the South or\n  Scorpio in the North. This indicates that it is the stars themselves\n  that revolve in place and not the celestial sphere as a whole, because\n  otherwise it would be impossible for Ursa Major to remain in the North\n  and Scorpio to remain in the South.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemora then brings another Braisa that relates a similar argument, as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חכמי ישראל אומרים ביום חמה מהלכת למטה מן הרקיע ובלילה למעלה מן הרקיע\n  וחכמי אומות העולם אומרים ביום חמה מהלכת למטה מן הרקיע ובלילה למטה מן\n  הקרקע אמר רבי ונראין דבריהן מדברינו שביום מעינות צוננין ובלילה רותחין</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara presents a similar dispute: The Jewish Sages say that\n  during the day the sun travels beneath the firmament and is therefore\n  visible, and at night it travels above the firmament. And the sages of\n  the nations of the world say that during the day the sun travels\n  beneath the firmament, and at night it travels beneath the earth and\n  around to the other side of the world. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: And\n  the statement of the sages of the nations of the world appears to be\n  more accurate than our statement. A proof to this is that during the\n  day, springs that originate deep in the ground are cold, and during\n  the night they are hot compared to the air temperature, which supports\n  the theory that these springs are warmed by the sun as it travels\n  beneath the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are these \"Sages of Israel\" the same people who are usually referred to in Tannaic texts as the \"Sages\" or are they different people (and if so who are they?)?</p>\n\n\n",

Why not say his heart was “kashah”: “hardened” or “ikeish”: \"stubborn\"?  One explanation is that “kaveid” also means “liver” and liver must be broiled and the more it is broiled, the harder it becomes. Usually, when a stubborn person is beaten and punished, his heart softens and he begins to concede and yield. So the Torah is telling us that the heart of Pharaoh was like liver: the more plagues he received, the more stubborn he became.\n(מיוסד על מדרש רבה שמות, ט,ח)</p>\n\n<p>That was an interesting fact from the Torah and Sages to tie it altogether with the other translation \"heavy\" as some in the comments noted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><em>To answer your question:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>So how does \"liver\" relate to \"honor\"? Your liver is the hardest working organ in your body, performing over 500 life-sustaining functions. It is the largest internal organ in the body and filters toxins from your blood, produces digestive enzymes called bile, stores vitamins and minerals, regulates hormones and the immune response and helps clot blood. Your liver is the only organ in your body that can regrow after parts of it have been removed or damaged. In fact, your liver can grow back to its full size in just a matter of months.</p>\n\n<p>Can you live without the liver though?  NO.  The liver is so crucial to existence that while you can live with only part of a liver, you can’t live without any liver at all. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, we can live without various body organs... but not without the liver.  Just as we cannot survive without our livers, we cannot have success in our lives or survive without any honor.  But perhaps a lesson to take from the connection between \"honor\" and your \"liver\" is that just like how if you lose a part of your liver it can regrow... so to if you lose a part of your honor it can be regained. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"Kaved\" is \"heavy.\" Liver is the heaviest internal organ.

    "content": "# Torah based on Mesopotamian (and other) sources\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A lot of parallels can be found between the earliest documents of the Torah/Tanach and the Sumerian/Babylonian/Akkadian religions in Mesopotamia. This led some to believe that the Torah was invented by men (compiled or cobbled together). Some even assume that Jews - who borrowed material and found inspiration from Mesopotamian and other indigenous, Canaanite, sources - did this during the Babylonian times.</p>\n<p>People throw dates and facts at me in an attempt to prove Judaism is based on other religions or myths. But what I would like to know is how the Rabbis' response to such allegations and what they teach about these sources?</p>\n<p>How can I prove them wrong or at least give them some explanation from a different point of view?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer (Nissan 5785):</strong> In response to renewed interest in this Q&A thread: I wrote this answer over 4 years ago (still in yeshiva at the time), after spending many long hours collecting information on the topic. However, I no longer agree with everything I wrote then. Since it's a long and complicated answer, I don't know if I'll ever be interested in significantly updating it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Since your question is divided into two parts - rabbinical responses and how you personally can respond, I'll include in my answer two parts as well: my own personal advice and rabbinical responses and responses of other individuals that I've gathered over time.</p>\n<p>First of all, a little about me: I've been interested in Tanach study, Jewish history and archeology since I was little, but only in the last couple of years did I start dedicating significant portions of my time to researching these subjects of Biblical Criticism, the Documentary Hypothesis, the Biblical Minimalism/Maximalism debate, Jewish chronology vs world chronology, Jewish ties to neighboring cultures during the Biblical and Talmudic eras, the impact of archeological discoveries on our understanding of Tanach, and more. I'm far from an expert on any of these, but I think I may know a little more than the average person.</p>\n<p>To be able to even begin to discuss these subjects, really the only thing you can do is <strong>research</strong>, b'chinat: \"Know what you shall answer an apikores\" or even \"know thine enemy\". This can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reading books on Biblical archeology, academic works on Tanach, news articles on new discoveries<sup>1</sup>, essays, the original Documentary Hypothesis texts and so forth.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Listening to lectures on said subjects. Many academic or academic-level lectures are available online.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Visiting museums and archeology sites that are relevant to the subjects that you're researching - the former can give you a clear picture of the artifacts and the latter will give you some understanding of the geography and geology of the subject matter.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I can do here is give you a bit of an outline of the some of the more well-known subjects and some pointers when attempting to approach the subject:</p>\n<p><strong>Biblical Criticism:</strong></p>\n<p>Biblical Criticism, it may be argued, was started by our sages millennia ago. Every discrepancy pointed out in the text is criticism of the text, but when we're talking about Biblical Criticism, it's usually a reference to the secular criticism which started more or less with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baruch Spinoza</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thomas Hobbes</a>. Spinoza, famously, in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Theologico-Politicus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</a> quotes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ibn_Ezra_on_Deuteronomy.1.2.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Ibn Ezra on Devarim 1:2</a> who spoke about \"the secret of the twelve\" - twelve verses in the Torah which according to him weren't written by Moshe but by later people (we're familiar with the question about the authorship of the last eight verses of the Torah, but Ibn Ezra began expanding the number of \"non-Mosaic verses\"). Spinoza used this as evidence that the Torah wasn't written by Moshe but by a much later author, perhaps Ezra. As such, it makes the text meaningless because it wasn't handed down to Am Yisrael at Mt. Sinai by Hashem and is simply a judicial document that might have been relevant at one point, but no more.</p>\n<p>Spinoza's view paved the way for the well-known late-18th century-mid-19th century \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Documentary Hypothesis</a>\", in its original form: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis#Wellhausen_and_the_new_documentary_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Graf-Wellhausen Hypothesis</a>. The theory expounded on Spinoza's and other previous academic research and suggested that not only wasn't the Torah written by Moshe, but it was actually a combination of four (later, some opined it to be five) different documents authored by different people or groups of people in the ancient Israelite culture and eventually all the texts were combined into one. The documents were titled <strong>J</strong> (or <strong>Y</strong>), <strong>E</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>P</strong> (and later also <strong>DH</strong>). The basis for this theory are the various textual discrepancies that appear in the Torah. For example, verses that it wouldn't make sense for them to have been written by Moshe, such as the last eight verses or the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.36.31?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">list of Edomite kings in Beresheet</a>. Another example is the changing of Hashem's name from the Shem Hameforash in one chapter to Elokim in another, which may point to a theological difference between different Israelite cults.</p>\n<p>Though many view Wellhausen's work as that of an objective secular academic, in fact, Wellhausen was something of an extremist Christian and an antisemite. Wellhausen proudly ended his work <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolegomena_zur_Geschichte_Israels\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels</a> by pointing out how he has now disproven the Israelite religion and brought glory to JC.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>The Documentary Hypothesis in its original form is now no longer considered valid as a number of the critiques were proven to be based on false assumptions, so the DH was altered and modified over the years. Unfortunately, the vast majority of secular academics still take the DH in one form or another to be factually correct.</p>\n<p>To break apart the secular criticism, there are a few approaches one can take:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Taking the classic Torah view on the matter. For example, the explanation to why there are different names of Hashem in the Torah is not because there were different religious factions among the ancient Israelites but because Hashem governs the world through different ways and methods. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Breuer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Breuer</a> is famous for his view on the need to accept the Biblical Criticism as-is but to face it head-on with a Torah-based approach. His position on the matter came to be known as \"Shitat Habechinot\" (\"the aspects approach\"). Some of his essays in Hebrew can be found <a href=\"https://cse.google.com/cse?q=%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%99%D7%90%D7%A8&cx=015758447251452153599:0_e_igd6nn8&lr=lang_iw&cof=FORID:0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. I also recommend his book שיטת הבחינות של הרב מרדכי ברויאר which is a compilation of several of his essays on his approach, replies by other scholars and his own replies to the replies.\nAnother rabbi who faced the criticism head-on (but with a different approach) is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zvi_Hoffmann\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Tzvi Hoffmann</a> (Radatz Hoffmann), in his commentary on the Torah. Especially recommended is his work on Vaykira. Some of his books can be found <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=2165\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Showing that the criticism is based on false assumptions, especially in how Biblical linguistics worked. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Cassuto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Prof. Moshe David (Umberto) Cassuto</a> took this approach in his work (though he claimed that his work was from a purely academic viewpoint). I recommend checking out his The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch: Eight Lectures by U. Cassuto (called in Hebrew תורת התעודות) (the introduction and lecture eight are available online <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033847if_/http://www.shalempress.co.il/download/Products/29_3_2011_55_29_cas%20gen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). His more famous works are his commentaries on Beresheet and Shemot (I personally have yet to read them).\nA lesser-known figure is someone whose work I've quoted in quite a few answers I've written here on MY in recent months, <a href=\"https://thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/ahron-marcus-the-leading-hasidic-zionist-scholar-of-ancient-judaism-you-never-heard-of/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ahron Marcus</a>. I discovered his work last summer. Unfortunately, many of his books were lost during the Holocaust, but those that we do have are a real treasure trove of information. In the context of Biblical Criticism, most central is his book Barzilai, a work on the psychology and origins of the Hebrew language (originally written in German and translated into Hebrew by one of his grandchildren)<sup>3</sup>. At the same time, Rabbi Marcus refers to the works of many of the leading scholars of his time in the field of Biblical Criticism and Biblical archeology, breaks down their arguments against the Tanach and offers his own views on the matters. The book is available online in German <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/barsilaisprache00marcgoog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and in Hebrew might be found in some used bookstores or in Otzar Hachochmah.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A great book that outlines many of the different views on various Biblical Criticism topics and suggests some solutions is <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/teacher/8095\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Amnon Bazak</a>'s Until This Day.</p>\n<p>A good lecture to hear is Rabbi Professor Shnayer Leiman's <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/725302/dr-shnayer-leiman/inspiration-and-canonicity-the-formation-of-the-biblical-text/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">class on Biblical Canonicity</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: Nowadays, Biblical Criticism is divided into two categories: Higher Criticism - everything that has to do with the concept of the DH, and Lower Criticism - everything that has to do with textual contradictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Biblical Archeology (Minimalism/Maximalism):</strong></p>\n<p>Biblical Archeology refers to archeological digs and studies of Israel and neighboring countries mentioned in the Tanach with regards to the eras described in the Tanach. For many years, it was a given that the majority of the Tanach was factually correct and this premise was the basis of many archeologists' approach during their work. As such, when a new discovery was made, the first question was: How does this fit with the Bible? An interesting anecdote is told in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/romanceoflastcru00vivi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Romance of The Last Crusade</a>, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michmas#World_War_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vivian Gilbert</a>, a British officer during WWI, who tells the story of another officer who figured out where the pass that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.14.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yonatan used during the Battle of Michmas</a> was and recycled Yonatan's strategy in order to defeat the Turkish garrison of that area. This approach is now known as Biblical Maximalism. Some of the more famous scholars and researchers in this field include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Kitchen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kenneth Kitchen</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amihai_Mazar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amichai Mazar</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigael_Yadin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yigal Yadin</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Zertal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adam Zertal</a>.</p>\n<p>Around the 1970's a new approach to Biblical Archeology arose in Europe and quickly spread around the world, becoming most prominent by the 90's: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_minimalism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblical Minimalism</a>. As outlined in the Wiki page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biblical minimalism...is a movement or trend in biblical scholarship...with two main claims:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>that the Bible cannot be considered reliable evidence for what had happened in ancient Israel;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>that \"Israel\" itself is a problematic subject for historical study.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The basic idea of Minimalism is that the Tanach is unreliable because its authors weren't contemporaries of the eras they wrote about<sup>4</sup> and as such, had no idea what they were talking about, didn't understand the past cultures, the geographical differences, the religious evolution of the people, the linguistics and so forth. A classic example, now long debunked but still unfortunately used by some of the lesser-knowledgeable followers of this school of thought, is that the camel was domesticated much later than the time of the Avot, so for Avraham to have had <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.24.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">camels</a> \"must be\" a later invention, inserted into the story.<sup>5</sup> Then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel#Domestication\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">evidence was found of much earlier camel domestication</a> and the theory was debunked. Another example is the doubt of the existence of King David, until <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dan_stele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a fragment of a stele</a> was found in Israel with the phrase \"Beit David\" inscribed on it. Currently, though, this is the only extra-Biblical evidence of David, so Minimalists still have a leg to stand on and can claim anything from the name being an invention of one of the Davidic kings to King David being the ruler of a small tribal state and not of a great, unified Israelite kingdom. Some of the more famous scholars and researchers in this field include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Finkelstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisrael Finkelstein</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Peter_Lemche\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niels Peter Lemche</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kenyon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kathleen Kenyon</a> (though she was apparently less outspoken on this subject (and also passed away long before Minimalism really drew hype)).</p>\n<p>Note: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible#Decreasing_conflict\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In more recent years</a>, some of the scholars on both sides of the division have attempted a kind of reconciliation by attempting to find common ground in their views and making some concessions.</p>\n<p>An excellent book to read is <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%99%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Yitzchak Meitlis</a>'s Excavating the Bible (לחפור את המקרא in Hebrew). Meitlis, a religious archeologist and lecturer, is on the Maximalist side of the debate.<sup>6</sup> Despite having been a student of, among others, Yisrael Finkelstein, the well-known Minimalist, he isn't afraid to criticize their research in his book, but also gives their due when he finds them to be correct.</p>\n<p>Another good book is Rabbi Ahron Marcus's Kadmoniyot (also available on Otzar Hachochmah), a book dedicated to analyzing many archeological discoveries of his era (late 19th-early 20th century) and showing how they line up with the Tanach.</p>\n<p>I also recommend taking a look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artifacts_in_biblical_archaeology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this list</a> on Wikipedia of artifacts relating to this field.</p>\n<p>One of the most famous debates on the originalism of the Tanach based on archeological evidence is on the story of the Flood and Noach's Ark. In the late 19th century, an archeologist named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smith_(Assyriologist)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">George Smith</a> discovered in Nineveh the library of King Ashurbanipal and in it, among other things, an ancient work titled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. After deciphering the eleventh tablet of the text, he concluded that it was the story of a Mesopotamian flood and saw this as evidence that the Biblical Flood was a copy of this story with a monotheistic twist. An excellent essay refuting all of Smith's arguments and of those that came after him was written by Rabbi Dr. Izaak Rapaport and can be found <a href=\"https://jbqnew.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/12/jbq_12_2_final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (pg. 27-35) (or my Hebrew translation with added background information (though still going through the editing process) <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AUB8fmALXQWXOoD3YuMOTmSUKPfBVFqF/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). A different approach was taken by Rabbi Philip Biberfeld in Universal Jewish History, vol I (available <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/4187\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), who attempted a more amalgamated solution<sup>6</sup>. In fact, most of the people that I've heard speak about the subject usually go with the approach that the fact that there are so many cultures around the world that have flood stories is evidence that the story is true. For example, Rabbi Yehoshua Zitron's <a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/lectures?v=69894\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">class on the topic</a>.</p>\n<p>Another is the seemingly lack of evidence for the Exodus. This is a very complicated issue, perhaps more so than most other Minimalist/Maximalist debates because there are disagreements even among the Maximalists over which pharaohs were the ones mentioned in the Torah and some artifacts that can be considered evidence for the Exodus relate to one pharaoh while others relate to a different pharaoh. From what I've seen, most agree that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramesses II \"The Great\"</a> and his father <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seti_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seti I</a> are the Exodus pharaohs. However,  there are historians who argue for different pharaohs. For example, Rabbi Alexander Hool in Pharaoh: Biblical History, Egypt and the Missing Millennium argues for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharaoh Thutmose II</a>. I haven't read his book yet, but a short outline of Rabbi Hool's argument can be found in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DV4IB0H1G2Z7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1946351962\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this review</a> by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/88/reb-chaim-haqoton\">Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein</a>. Another example is Damien Mackey from the University of Sidney, who argues in several essays (all can be found <a href=\"https://sydney.academia.edu/DamienMackey\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>; for example, <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/43493994/The_Plagues_of_Egypt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>) that the entire Egyptian chronology must be reorganized, including removing several pharaohs who actually appear twice or more, or weren't really pharaohs but high-ranking officials in other dynasties. In his view, the pharaoh of the Exodus was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neferhotep_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Neferhotep I</a>.</p>\n<p>Pieces of evidence for the Exodus can include: <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/jw/s/Evidence-for-the-Exodus.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Comparisons between the Torah and what we know about Ramesses II</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/bookofgates.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">relief from the Book of Gates</a> that may detail <a href=\"https://rationalbelief.org.il/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%A9-%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%AA-%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A3-%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Egyptian take on the Splitting of Yam Suf</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_Stele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Tempest Stele</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipuwer_Papyrus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Ipuwer Papyrus</a>. On the Minimalist side of things, views can go anywhere from there was no Exodus to <a href=\"http://www.asor.org/anetoday/2017/09/exodus-archaeology-text/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there was a small Exodus of only the Levites</a>.</p>\n<p>A third example, relatively less well-known, is the discovery of a Neo-Assyrian text telling of the mythic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad#Birth_legend\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">birth of King Sargon of Akkad</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...My high priestess mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As can be clearly seen, there are similarities to the story of Moshe. However, most people nowadays who hold the DH to be true agree that the Torah was written prior to the dating of this text, which is the 7th century BCE. Therefore, it's much more likely that the people who wrote this myth based it on Moshe and not the other way around. An analysis of the two stories can be seen <a href=\"https://alhatorah.org/Moshe%27s_Birth_and_the_Legend_of_Sargon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and some calculations on the matter can be seen <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/35752394/Did_Sargon_of_Akkad_influence_the_Exodus_account_of_the_baby_Moses\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jewish Chronology VS World Chronology:</strong></p>\n<p>A complicated issue in itself is the question of how the traditional Jewish chronology fits with the world chronology (or vice-versa, depending how you look at it). The main problem is that the traditional Jewish view of history is primarily based on the chronology presented in Seder Olam Rabbah. There are a few problems with the SOR chronology. One is that it doesn't feature all of the Persian kings known to history nor does it present a length of time for the Persian Empire that could theoretically contain all of the kings. Another problem is that it says that that Bayit Rishon stood for 410 years and Bayit Sheni for 420, but other records and calculations make out the two Temples for existing for longer.</p>\n<p>Good overviews of the issue can be found in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_years_(Jewish_calendar)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Wikipedia page</a> on this issue, <a href=\"http://ivri.org.il/2014/03/in-search-of-lost-time-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> in the Hebrew blog ארץ העברים, in <a href=\"https://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2015/05/rabbi-leibtag-shiurim-hebrew-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/5110/sabbahillel?tab=profile\">sabbah hillel</a>'s blog and in <a href=\"https://rabbimanning.com/index.php/about/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Anthony Manning</a>'s classes on the subject: <a href=\"http://rabbimanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Controversial-Issues-from-the-Second-Temple-Shiur-2-The-Missing-168-Years.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Old version</a>, <a href=\"http://rabbimanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Missing-168-Years-Part-1.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">new version pt. 1</a>, <a href=\"http://rabbimanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Missing-168-Years-Part-2.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">new version pt. 2</a></p>\n<p>Over the years there have been many who have offered various solutions for the discrepancies between the two chronologies. <a href=\"http://www.rootsandrituals.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitchell First</a> brings a vast majority of the various opinions in his book Jewish History In Conflict (parts of it can be read <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=3w8TIrRhpmEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Rabbi Alexander Hool offers his own theory in The Challenge of Jewish History: The Bible, the Greeks and the Missing 168 Years.</p>\n<p>The gist of the various opinions is that someone lied. The question is: Who, why and to what extent? Some say the Persians lied. Some say the Greek historians lied. Some say the Christians lied. And some even say that Jewish rabbinical authorities lied. Some say even Daniel was in on it.<sup>8</sup> The one exception is the view that the world chronology is correct and that SOR was never meant to be taken literally but is more like a collection of midrashim. As such, even among Jewish Biblical Maximalists, there are many that view SOR as non-authoritative and follow the world chronology, such as Rabbi Mordechai Breuer, Rabbi Ahron Marcus, <a href=\"https://library.osu.edu/projects/hebrew-lexicon/03902.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Yaakov Liwer</a>, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8_%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Yehoshua Meir Grintz</a> and Dr. Yitzchak Meitlis. In other words, to choose to accept the world chronology is not necessarily problematic.</p>\n<p>To conclude: Information is important. The more information you have on these various subjects, that better you can hold your ground when discussing these subjects. Much as it may seem that the secular approach has the high ground - that's not actually a simple case to make, when looking at all of the facts. But one has to know the facts first.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Around Purim-time I spoke with a guy I knew from yeshiva who is now starting his third year as an archeology student here in Israel. He informed me that a significant portion of discoveries made aren't revealed to the public until long after the initial find. That's why a news header can be the click-baity \"AMAZING NEW 2ND TEMPLE PERIOD DISCOVERY MADE\" and when you actually read the article, it'll say that the artifact was actually found anywhere between half a year to a few years prior. So...not exactly new. To get in on the know of these things you'd either have to be part of the research field or subscribe to archeology magazines like the <a href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/magazines/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BAR</a>.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Wellhausen claims in his writings that the original works of the Tanach were the Nevi'im and that the Israelite culture was based off of the connection the prophets had with God, until \"the rabbis\" came and forced the Torah portion of the Tanach onto the people of Israel, until JC came and revealed the truth to the people. Forget, of course, that JC kept most of the Torah.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> Unfortunately the second half of the book, which, among other things, was said to discuss the meanings of Tanachic names, was never published and the manuscript was lost during the Holocaust.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Which is partially true in some cases. For example, Yirmiyahu was only a contemporary of the last few kings of Judea, yet wrote about everything from the final days of David to the end of the Judean kingdom in Melachim.</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup> In The Bible As History by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Keller_(writer)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Werner Keller</a>, written before the discovery of evidence of early camel domestication, he suggests that \"camels\" are actually \"donkeys\".</p>\n<p><sup>6</sup> I've heard that being religious - whether Jewish or Christian - doesn't make it a given that one would be a Maximalist. Werner Keller, mentioned above, was Christian but decidedly minimalistic in his views, at least at the time that he wrote The Bible As History. Certainly, many non-religious scholars can be found on either side of the debate. Adam Zertal z\"l used to say that his research couldn't be considered to be based on religious subjectivity because he was one of the most secular researchers out there, having grown up in an extremely left-wing, secular kibbutz in Israel.</p>\n<p><sup>7</sup> I highly recommend checking out Rabbi Biberfeld's footnotes and looking up the sources he uses. Some can even be found online. A particularly useful site for finding such texts is archive.com.</p>\n<p><sup>8</sup> Note that there are some nafka minot to arriving at the conclusion that our sages were the ones that falsified history. For example, it means that the Hebrew year is actually much later, much closer to the year 6000 (!). Another is that it would mean that our count of Shmittin and Yovelot is wrong. As told by Rabbi Manning, the latter reason is what ultimately made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Schwab\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon Schwab</a> go back on his conclusion that the discrepancies were created by our sages (for Rabbi Schwab's entire back-and-forth on the matter, see <a href=\"https://www.hyehudi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rabbi-Shimon-Schwab%E2%80%99s-Conspiracy-Theory-About-Jewish-Chronology-.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Part 1 of the book \"<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/ani-maamin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ani Maamin. Biblical criticism, Historical Truth, and the Thirteen Principles of Faith</a>\" by R' Joshua Berman deals with the OP's question. It has a simple enough form. It discusses the Tanakh in Historical Context.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Regarding Divinity of the Torah</strong></p>\n<p>R' Berman posits, that the Torah carries a universal and eternal message. In its political thought it broke from Ancient political thought. It replaced a class hierarchy of the society with the <em>horizontal society</em> (see also R' Jose Faur's book \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1613292279\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horizontal Society</a>\" on the same subject) of people who carry an equal legal responsibility. Torah mandates that education, ability to read and write, be available equally to everyone, as opposed to elitist societies of the Ancient world. The Torah radically changed the notion of the political office, based on requirements of the rule of law. The same is true with its view of the Judiciary class, which is supposed to represent the power of the people rather than a particular group of religious or military elites. The Torah taxation policy also reflects the economic benefit of each society individual. It is certainly offers an amaizing vision for the masses, which was unheard of in the ancient world elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The historical footprint in the Tanakh</strong></p>\n<p>The documentary hypothesis, which is the basis of the modern historical theory, was coined by german historians in late 1700s. Unfortunately, the documents of the ancient world are not suitable for such a study. R' Berman shows and brings sources that the existing records of the ancient world outside of Tanakh can only be made meaningful as <em>Exhortation Documents</em>. Not only such is the case of the Egyptian or Hittite Empire records, but also such is the case of the works by Greek and Roman historians, as well as many medieval historical accounts. The Tanakh can also be interpreted from the point of view of such a genre. R' Berman presents the story of Rahav, analysis of numbers in Tanakh (such as sizes of armies). Yet, Tanakh is not a myth as R' Berman shows.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Exodus Evidence and Scholarship.</strong></p>\n<p>R' Berman connects the Kadesh-Bas relief to the account of the Bible as evidence for Exodus. While it was used by Egyptians as a propaganda for their supposed victory over the Hittite empire, the existing versions of the relief make one seriously doubt of such a battle. Rather all of them point to the Exodus of the Jews, as R' Berman shows in his work.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is another work \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B09NJNJVKY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Accuracy of the Bible</a>\" by the Egyptologist Abraham Shalom Yahuda, from 1930s, which has been <strong>cancelled</strong> by the academic world since its publication. The author shows that the language of the Torah carries in it a footprint of the Egyptian culture and language of the specific period in Egyptian history, which had not existed already at the time of Judean kings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The Story of the Flood</strong></p>\n<p>R' Berman agrees with broad similarity of the account of Gilgamesh and the Biblical Flood story. But that's where the similarity ends. The Torah has many important details missing in the story of Gilgamesh, and vice versa - important details of Gilgamesh epic are missing from the Torah. Any source critical approach to the story has been debunked as a failure to be theory that scientifically reproduces the text.</p>\n<p>Dr. A.S. Yahuda further points out that the account in the Torah has strong Egyptian elements. The name for the ark, is not the Akkadian word for the ship <em>elippu</em>, but the Egyptian word <em>teba</em> - box, chest, coffer, ship. The flood is not called the Akkadian <em>abubu</em>, but Egyptian <em>mabbul</em> meaning abundance of water. There are more such examples in his book, which indicates that the story of the flood was known in Egypt as a part of the universal history, not particular Babylonian mythology included at a later time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Although this answer will most likely not meet the satisfaction of most people, I think it is important to be open-minded and consider ideas that we would initially reject in other circumstances. For example, it is very possible that the Torah used pagan myths to its advantage. For instance, take the flood story. It is well-documented that the Norah story is very similar to the Gilgamesh poem, in many respects. Critics are quick to use this example to try to belittle the Torah. But I take a different approach. It is possible that the Torah deliberately copied pagan myths with a purpose. For example, while the pagan myths lack any sense of morality in their stories, the Bible always adds moral twists which makes it superior to the pagan myths. Looking at it from this new perspective, it is not concerning if the Bible borrowed material from pagan sources, so long that it modifies, enhances, and refine them to fit the needs of the people listening.</p>\n\n\n",

Contrarily if they want to push his body on a neonate and the neonate will die because of this, or to act a suicide to avoid the dead of the neonate, the right choice is to do nothing and let them to push him, because the life of the neonate is not more important than his life.

In the first case, where they don’t single anyone out, the logic is that nobody can be handed over, because who can determine who’s blood is “reddest”? The question on Reish Lakish, he says, is the case where he’s singled out but not liable to the death penalty: why don’t we say the fact that he’s singled out makes his blood “redder,” since he’s going to die anyway? Perhaps, he says, <strong>the reason that one must give up his life by murder is not the logic, but a tradition; the logic was later posed to justify the tradition, but the law still holds even when the logic does not.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishnah’s conclusion invalidates the premise of your question: as murder being one of the “big three” is derived from oral tradition, not from the logic posed in the Gemara, we still can’t murder even when the logic doesn’t seem to apply.</p>\n\n\n",

He must not act overly haughty towards Israel, as it says, “lest his heart become haughty over his brothers” (Deut. 17:20). <strong>He must be merciful and compassionate to the small and great with regard and deal with their wants and welfare. He must show respect for even the lowest of the low</strong>. When he speaks to the entire Congregation together, he is to speak sensitively, as it says, “listen to me my brothers and my people” (I Chronicles 28:2) and “and should you today be a servant to your people…” (I Kings 12:7). <strong>He must always behave with extreme modesty</strong>, for we have never had anyone greater than Moses Our Teacher who said, “and what are we? your complaint is not against us” (Exodus 16:7-8). He must suffer their burdens and criticisms and anger, “as a nursing father carries the sucking child” (Num. 11:12). Scriptures calls him ‘shepherd’, “To be a shepherd over Jacob His people” (Psalms 78:71), and the (proper) behavior of a shepherd is as has been defined in the Tradition, as it says, “As a shepherd who leads his flock, and with his arm he gathers the lambs, and in his breast he carries….” (Isaiah 40:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being as there doesn't appear to be anything that says he <em><strong>shouldn't</strong></em> not ask for forgiveness, one could argue that asking for forgiveness for a misdeed against another Jew falls exactly in line with the type of behavior a king should exhibit.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam (MT <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960660/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twelve.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Issurei Biah 12:2</a>) discusses the punishment for a Jewish man having relations with non-Jewish women</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When, by contrast, one engages in relations with a gentile woman with\n  a licentious intent, he is given \"stripes for rebellious conduct\"\n  according to Rabbinic Law. [This is a] decree, lest this lead to\n  marriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>In other words relations with non-Jewish women are strictly forbidden</strong> for fear they will lead to marriage since intermarriage is forbidden (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 7:3</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding adultery with a Jewish woman, see <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/mitzvah35/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. And see also this related question: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/51153/11501\">From where do we know that sexual intercourse with a non-jewish woman is forbidden?</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Because Judaism allowed a man to have more than one wife, until a thousand years ago, technically a married man could go find another woman without breaking <em>halacha</em>, and thus the strictest halachic definition of \"adultery\" only concerns relations between a married woman and a man who's not her husband.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it should go without saying that for a married man to cheat on his wife is despicable, wrong, a violation to fellow human beings, and a sin to God. (At the bare minimum, all non-marital relations are prohibited.) The technical term \"adultery\" is not used, however. </p>\n\n<p>A series of post-Biblical prohibitions (likely dating back to the Maccabees) exists concerning a Jewish man having promiscuous relations with a non-Jewish woman; see Avodah Zarah 36b. If the non-Jewish woman was married, there's an additional Biblical prohibition: it appears from the commentaries that the traditional <em>thou-shalt-not</em> was intended for relations between Jews as that was far more of a concern than some far-flung people who didn't speak your language; however it violates the <em>thou-shalt</em> of Genesis 2:24, <em>therefore a man shall ... be united with his wife.</em> (See Tos. Kiddushin 21a and Beis Shmuel E\"H 16:1)</p>\n\n<p>Short answer -- it's terrible and wrong. Can and does lead to the desecration of God's Name. All legalese aside, Rabbi Emanuel Feldman commented on one high-profile philanderer that a midrash reads: <em>The pagan says \"there is none above me.\" The thief says \"there is no one parallel to me.\" The adulterer says \"there is none at all but me.\"</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Some sources to support @Mbloch's answer to understand the Sugya in full (Gemmorah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.36b.13?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 36a</a>).</p>\n<p>In short, it is a [very severe] Rabbinical decree, since Rabbis compared all gentile women to ritually unclean (נידה) it can be [speculated] as adultery Derabanan. All other comparisons (mistress, gentile or prostitute) do not constitute adultery:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ישראל הבא על העובדת כוכבים הלכה למשה מסיני היא דאמר מר הבועל ארמית קנאין פוגעין בו</p>\n<p>The Gemara rejects this: The prohibition concerning a Jew who engaged in intercourse with a gentile woman is a halakha transmitted to Moses from Sinai, not a rabbinic ordinance. As the Master said: With regard to one who engages in intercourse with an Aramean woman, zealots may attack him, as Pinehas did to Zimri in the wilderness (see Numbers 25:6–8).</p>\n<p>א\"ל דאורייתא בפרהסיא וכמעשה שהיה ואתו אינהו גזור אפילו בצינעא בצינעא נמי בית דינו של חשמונאי גזרו</p>\n<p>He said to him: By Torah law intercourse with a gentile is prohibited in public, and only in situations like the incident that occurred, as described in Numbers, chapter 25. And the students of Shammai and Hillel came and decreed that the prohibition applies even in private. The Gemara raises another difficulty: This was also prohibited in private, as the court of the Hasmoneans decreed that it is prohibited.</p>\n<p>[דכי אתא רב דימי אמר ב\"ד של חשמונאי גזרו] ישראל הבא על העובדת כוכבים חייב משום נשג\"א</p>\n<p>As when Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said: The court of the Hasmoneans decreed that a Jew who engaged in intercourse with a gentile woman bears liability for transgressing four prohibitions, represented by the mnemonic: Nun, shin, gimmel, alef. These letters stands for: Menstruating woman [nidda], maidservant [shifḥa], gentile [goya], and married woman [eshet ish]. By rabbinic law, a man who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman is considered to have violated the prohibitions involved in having intercourse with all four of these women.</p>\n<p>כי אתא רבין אמר משום נשג\"ז</p>\n<p>And when Ravin came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said: He bears liability for four prohibitions represented by the mnemonic: Nun, shin, gimmel, zayin, which stands for: Menstruating woman [nidda], maidservant [shifḥa], gentile [goya], and prostitute [zona]. In any case, it is apparent that this decree was in force before the time of the students of Shammai and Hillel.</p>\n<p>כי גזרו בית דינו של חשמונאי ביאה אבל ייחוד לא ואתו אינהו גזור אפי' ייחוד ייחוד נמי בית דינו של דוד גזרו</p>\n<p>The Gemara answers: When the court of the Hasmoneans decreed, they prohibited only sexual intercourse, but with regard to seclusion with a gentile woman, no, they did not prohibit that. And the students of Shammai and Hillel came and decreed that even seclusion with a gentile woman is prohibited. The Gemara raises an objection: Seclusion was also prohibited earlier, as the court of King David decreed that with regard to this matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The simplified approach says they sinned too much, but a more intelligent one holds they were beyond our shallow understanding of the final judgment and the WTC.</p>\n<p>In some sense, D\"h were practically living in the WTC - world with no physical needs (or all needs met), and spending their [last] days enjoying the closeness to G-d, as it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.17a.12?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brochos 17a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>העולם הבא אין בו לא אכילה ולא שתיה ולא פריה ורביה ולא משא ומתן ולא קנאה ולא שנאה ולא תחרות אלא צדיקים יושבין ועטרותיהם בראשיהם ונהנים מזיו השכינה שנאמר ויחזו את האלהים ויאכלו וישתו:</p>\n<p>The World-to-Come is not like this world.\nIn the World-to-Come there is no eating, no drinking,\nno procreation, no business negotiations,\nno jealousy, no hatred, and no competition.\nRather, the righteous sit with their crowns upon their heads, enjoying the splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated:\n“And they beheld God, and they ate and drank” (Exodus 24:11), meaning that beholding God’s countenance is tantamount to eating and drinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it appears logical to say they didn't live (as we live), they existed in a timeless reality of \"...And they beheld G-d\".</p>\n<p>That probably addresses the question of how they learned Torah - because they exalted to a higher spiritual level they treated Torah similarly to how angels did (see Moses' argument with angels, Bemidbar Rabah 17).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>My biggest problem is how did they manage to co-exist with Dor Ha'Aretz (the generation of their kids) that longed to establish G-d's kingdom \"on the Earth below\".</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I think Torah says it pretty much explicitly (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.18.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex 18.3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִי מִמָּחֳרָת וַיֵּשֶׁב מֹשֶׁה לִשְׁפֹּט אֶת־הָעָם וַיַּעֲמֹד הָעָם עַל־מֹשֶׁה <strong>מִן־הַבֹּקֶר עַד־הָעָרֶב</strong>׃<br>\n  ... כִּי־יִהְיֶה לָהֶם דָּבָר בָּא אֵלַי <strong>וְשָׁפַטְתִּי בֵּין אִישׁ וּבֵין רֵעֵהוּ</strong> וְהוֹדַעְתִּי אֶת־חֻקֵּי הָאֱלֹהִים וְאֶת־תּוֹרֹתָיו׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Next day, Moses sat as magistrate among the people, while the people stood about Moses <strong>from morning until evening</strong>. ...

Think yourself, they had lots of property, livestock, slaves, and they were terribly bored, as you mentioned - no need to hunt, grow crops, cook, wash dishes, not even using the bathroom (חוץ מכבודכם), etc. So they were suing one another just about everything - \"this is my slave... this is my piece of Manna... my bull, etc\".</p>\n\n<p>They were so \"obsessed\" with suing each other they needed a total of 78.000 judges (Yitroh's advice <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.18.21?lang=bi&with=Sanhedrin&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanh 18</a>) for 600.000 males (let's estimate the whole population to be 6 fold of that - 3.6M), or 2.200 judges per 100.000, while in the USA it's <a href=\"https://en.actualitix.com/country/wld/professional-judges.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">less than 2 judges per 100.000</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I'm probably wildly exaggerating, they had some spare time to argue with Moses, prepare sacrifices, do some politics (Nesiim, Zkenim, etc), sin with gentiles, and, of course, <strong>learn Torah with Moses</strong> (where available).</p>\n\n<p>:)</p>\n\n\n",

He goes on to say that directly before Moshe's death the people came to him for clarifications on what had been forgotten up until that point. He write further that when he died, and doubts eventually crept in to the laws, they had a system of exegesis using the 13 principles, as well as the rule from Exodus 23:2. To conclude, since there wasn't a chance for doubts to exist as long as Moshe was alive (through ongoing clarification with him), there was no need to make use of the 13 principles to create new clarity in the information. However, that does not mean they could not, there was just no need for it (it seems to me based on Rambam).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן אמרו רבותינו ז\"ל בברייתא (בת\"כ) וידבר ה' אל משה בהר סיני מה תלמוד לומר בהר סיני והלא כל התורה כולה נאמרה מסיני. אלא לומר לך מה שמטה נאמרה בכלליה ופרטיה ודקדוקיה מסיני אף כל המצות כלליהן ופרטיהן ודקדוקיהן מסיני. והנה לך משל שהקב\"ה אמר למשה בסכות תשבו שבעת ימים (ויקרא כג) אחר כן הודיע שהסוכה הזאת חובה על הזכרים לא על הנקבות ושאין החולים חייבין בה ולא הולכי דרך. ושלא יהיה סכוכה אלא בצמח הארץ ולא יסככנה בצמר ולא במשי ולא בכלים אפילו מאשר תצמח הארץ. כגון הכסתות והכרים והבגדים. והודיע שהאכילה והשתיה והשינה בה כלו חובה. ושלא יהיה בחללה פחות משבעה טפחים אורך על שבעה טפחים רוחב. ושלא יהיה גובה הסוכה פחות מעשרה טפחים. וכאשר בא הנביא ע\"ה נתנה לו המצוה הזאת ופירושה וכן השש מאות ושלש עשרה מצות הם ופירושם. המצות בכתב והפירוש על פה. </p>\n  \n  <p>ויהי בארבעים שנה בעשתי עשר חדש בר\"ח שבט הקהיל את העם ואמר להם הגיע זמן מותי ואם יש בכם מי ששמע הלכה ושכחה יבא וישאלני ואבאר אותה וכל מי שנסתפקה עליו שאלה יבא ואפרשנה לו כמו שנאמר (דברים א) הואיל משה באר את התורה הזאת לאמר. וכן אמרו חכמים בספרי (פ' דברים) כל ששכח הלכה אחת יבא וישנה וכל שיש לו לפרש יבא ויפרש. ולקחו מפיו ברור ההלכות ולמדו הפרושים כל הזמן ההוא מר\"ח שבט עד שבעה באדר. וכשהיה לפני מותו החל לכתוב התורה בספרים וכתב י\"ג ספרי תורה גוילים כולם מבי\"ת בראשית עד למ\"ד לעיני כל ישראל (ב\"ב פ\"ק דף טו) ונתן ספר לכל שבט ושבט להתנהג בו וללכת בחוקותיו והספר הי\"ג נתנו ללוים ואמר להם לקוח את ספר התורה הזה (דברים לא). אח\"כ עלה אל ההר בחצי היום השביעי (ספרי פ' האזינו) לחדש אדר (מגילה דף יג:) כפי אשר דקדקה הקבלה.</p>\n  \n  <p>והיה המקרה ההוא אשר קראו מות בעינינו בשביל שחסרנו ופקדנו אותו וחיים לו לכבוד המעלה שעלה אליה וכן אמרו (סוטה דף יג:) משה רבינו ע\"ה לא מת אלא עלה ומשמש במרום והדברים באלו הענינים ארוכים מאד ואין זה מקומם. וכאשר מת ע\"ה אחר שהנחיל ליהושע מה שנאצל עליו מן הפירוש והחכים והתבונן בו יהושע ואנשי דורו. וכל מה שקבל ממשה הוא או אחד מן הזקנים אין לדבר עליו ולא נפלה בו מחלוקת. ומי שלא שמע בו פירוש מפי הנביא ע\"ה מן הענינים המשתרגים מהם הוציא דינים בסברות במדות השלש עשרה הנתונות על הר סיני שהתורה נדרשת בהם. ובאותם הדינים שהוציאום יש דברים שלא נפלה בהן מחלוקת אבל הסכימו עליהם ויש מהם מה שנפלה בו מחלוקת בין שתי דעות זה אומר בכה וזה אומר בכה זה סובר סברא ונתחזקה לדעתו וזה סובר סברא ונתחזקה לדעתו כי מדות ההיקש שעל דרך התוכחת יקרה בסברותיהם המקרה הזה וכשהיתה נופלת המחלוקת היו הולכים אחרי הרוב כמו שנאמר אחרי רבים להטות (שמות כג) ודע שהנבואה אינה מועילה בפירושי התורה ובהוצאת ענפי המצות בשלש עשרה מדות אבל מה שיעשה יהושע ופנחס בענין העיון והסברא הוא שיעשה רבינא ורב אשי אבל יתרון הנביא ופעלו במצוה אם תשאל עליו הוא חי נפשי מן העיקרים הגדולים העצומים שעליו משען הדת ויסודה:</p>\n  \n  <p>וכאשר מת יהושע בן נון ע\"ה למד לזקנים מה שקבל מן הפירוש ומה שהוציאו בזמנו מן הדינים ולא נפל עליו מחלוקת. ואשר נפל בו מחלוקת פסקו בו הדין על פי רוב הזקנים. ועליהם אמר הכתוב (יהושע כד) וכל ימי הזקנים אשר האריכו ימים אחרי יהושע. ואחר כן למדו הזקנים ההם מה שקבלו מפי יהושע אל הנביאים ע\"ה והנביאים למדו זה לזה. ואין זמן שלא היה בו התבוננות וחדוש הענינים. והיו חכמי כל דור משימים דברי הקודמין עיקר והיו לומדין מהם ומחדשים ענינים. והעיקרים המקובלים לא נחלקו בהם.</p>\n  \n  <p>ע\"ש ומימות משה רבינו עד רבינו הקדוש ע\"ה לא חיברו חיבור שמלמדין אותו ברבים בתורה שבע\"פ אלא שבכל דור ודור ראש בית דין או נביא שהיה באותו הדור כותב לעצמו זכרון השמועות ששמע מרבותיו והוא מלמד על פה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In sefer hamitzvos, 'שרש ב, the Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Shorashim.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מה שיוציא אדם ענפים מן השרשים שנאמרו לו למשה בסיני בבאור והם תרי\"ג מצות <strong>ואפילו היה המוציא משה בעצמו</strong> אין ראוי למנותם. והראיה על זה כלו אמרם בגמרא תמורה (דף ט\"ז) אלף ושבע מאות קלין וחמורין וגזירות שוות ודקדוקי סופרים שנשתכחו בימי אבלו של משה ואעפ\"כ החזירן עתניאל בן קנז מפלפולו שנאמר כל איש אשר יכה את קרית ספר ולכדה וגו' וילכדה עתניאל בן קנז. וכשהיו כך הנשכחות כמה היה הכלל שנשכח ממנו זה המספר, כי גם מן השקר שנאמר שנשכח ממנו כל מה שנודע ובלא ספק היו אותם הדינים המוצאים בקל וחומר ובזולתו מהמדות אלפים רבים ואלו כלם היו נודעים בימי משה. <strong>ונאמר עליהם דקדוקי סופרים כי כל מה שלא שמעו בסיני בבאור הנה הוא מדברי סופרים.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Moshe himself chose to rely on the י\"ג מדות and ריבויים rather than rely on prophecy (not unlike the Vilna Gaon, who <a href=\"http://rechovot.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-vilna-gaon-maggid-and-work-ethic-of.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">refused</a> the offers of מלאכים to teach him Torah), I'm sure others did so as well.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps G-d was silent on some questions, preferring them to be derived rather than prophesied.

    "content": "# Legal status of one sentenced to death until execution?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What's the legal status of one who's sentenced to death by a court (say smoked on Shabbos) from the moment of the verdict till the actual death:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What're his economical rights (his property, estate, debts, etc)?</p></li>\n<li><p>What are his Mitzvas obligations - is he still commanded to keep all the Mitzvos till dead?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rambam, <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e112.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלכות סנהדרין פרק י\"ג</a>: Once the verdict [of death] has been rendered, [the convicted] is executed without delay on the same day.  </p>\n\n<p>There is very little time between the verdict and execution, there is not much time for Mitzos.  Rambam doesn't mention whether he does וידוי or קריאת שמע before death. In chapter 13:2, Rambam adds that one who <em>confesses</em> is given a bit of Frankincense mixed with wine to befuddle his mind (שתטרף דעתו עליו וישתכר), and put him into a drunken state, presumably to numb the pain of execution.  I would infer from these הלכות that Mitvos are pretty much irrelevant from the point of conviction onward.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding loss of possessions: Although Rambam also writes that the relatives of the convicted do not mourn him after death (13:6), it doesn't say anywhere that the condemned loses his possessions. I have never seen anywhere stated that there is any monetary penalty accompanying the death penalty.  On the contrary, the Gemara states that someone who is liable to a monetary penalty or lashes, and also the death penalty, only gets the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>A rationale for this: We usually speak of the death penalty as atonement, not punishment. So no other penalty is required to atone for the convicted. Therefore the court has no need to take his possessions, and they will pass to his heirs, as in a normal death, since the execution is sufficient for atonement.</p>\n\n\n",

However, since the punishment for murder isn't the most severe punishment (stoning and burning are considered more severe), then the question may not always be applicable (i.e. if he was sentenced to stoning for his previous crime, that is already the most severe death penalty and can't be topped).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Of course (and H/T to Heshy for mentioning it), this is only referring to the physical punishment that Bais Din is required to mete out, since corporeal beings can not receive more than a single death sentence.

And that is because if this [really] was so, it would have been proper for the Torah to publicize this miracle that was in her giving birth to Moses and Aaron, just like it publicized Sarah's giving birth to Isaac. For this was much more wondrous because she would have been 130 when Moses was born and 127 when Aaron was born.

He reiterates this in Wars of the Lord 6:2:7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As this was a difficulty for some of our Rabbis because they believed that this miracle did indeed consist in a change of the order of the movements of the heavenly bodies, they maintained that something like this miracle had actually been performed by Moses. But if this were true, the Torah would obviously not fail to mention it, since it is a pivotal point upon which the whole belief in miracles rest.</p>\n<p>(Feldman translation Vol. III p. 493)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, in his commentary to Genesis 18:6 <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/96345/13438\">he rejects the view that Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt</a>, and in his commentary to Numbers 22:21 <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/105873/13438\">he rejects the view that Bilam's donkey spoke</a>, because in both of those cases there would have been no purpose for those miracles.</p>\n<p>It would seem, then, according to Ralbag, that we generally cannot posit miracles not mentioned in the Torah because a miracle that's not recorded in the Torah almost defeats the whole purpose of the miracle.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Pirkei Avot has two lists of miracles:</p>\n\n<p>Avot 5:4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עֲשָׂרָה נִסִּים נַעֲשׂוּ לַאֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְמִצְרַיִם וַעֲשָׂרָה עַל\n  הַיָּם. עֶשֶׂר מַכּוֹת הֵבִיא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא עַל\n  הַמִּצְרִיִּים בְּמִצְרַיִם וְעֶשֶׂר עַל הַיָּם. </p>\n  \n  <p>Ten miracles were wrought for our ancestors in Egypt, and ten at the\n  sea. Ten plagues did the Holy one, blessed be He, bring upon the\n  Egyptians in Egypt and ten at the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe that Avot Derav Nattan expands on exactly what these miracles were. I will see if I can locate that, and if so, edit it into the question. Offhand, I don't recall if all 10 are mentioned in the Torah, but I don't think so.</p>\n\n<p>The next Mishnah, Avot 5:5, list 10 miracles, none of which are found in the Torah or anywhere else in Tanac\"h:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עֲשָׂרָה נִסִּים נַעֲשׂוּ לַאֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְּבֵית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ. לֹא\n  הִפִּילָה אִשָּׁה מֵרֵיחַ בְּשַׂר הַקֹּדֶשׁ, וְלֹא הִסְרִיחַ בְּשַׂר\n  הַקֹּדֶשׁ מֵעוֹלָם, וְלֹא נִרְאָה זְבוּב בְּבֵית הַמִּטְבָּחַיִם,\n  וְלֹא אֵרַע קֶרִי לְכֹהֵן גָּדוֹל בְּיוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים, וְלֹא כִבּוּ\n  גְשָׁמִים אֵשׁ שֶׁל עֲצֵי הַמַּעֲרָכָה, וְלֹא נָצְחָה הָרוּחַ אֶת\n  עַמּוּד הֶעָשָׁן, וְלֹא נִמְצָא פְסוּל בָּעֹמֶר וּבִשְׁתֵּי הַלֶּחֶם\n  וּבְלֶחֶם הַפָּנִים, עוֹמְדִים צְפוּפִים וּמִשְׁתַּחֲוִים רְוָחִים,\n  וְלֹא הִזִּיק נָחָשׁ וְעַקְרָב בִּירוּשָׁלַיִם מֵעוֹלָם, וְלֹא אָמַר\n  אָדָם לַחֲבֵרוֹ צַר לִי הַמָּקוֹם שֶׁאָלִין בִּירוּשָׁלַיִם</p>\n  \n  <p>Ten wonders were wrought for our ancestors in the Temple: [1] no woman\n  miscarried from the odor of the sacred flesh; [2] the sacred flesh\n  never became putrid; [3] no fly was ever seen in the slaughterhouse;\n  [4] no emission occurred to the high priest on the Day of Atonement;\n  [5] the rains did not extinguish the fire of the woodpile; [6] the\n  wind did not prevail against the column of smoke; [7] no defect was\n  found in the omer, or in the two loaves, or in the showbread; [8] the\n  people stood pressed together, yet bowed down and had room enough; [9]\n  never did a serpent or a scorpion harm anyone in Jerusalem; [10] and\n  no man said to his fellow: the place is too congested for me to lodge\n  overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> the above English translation is from Sefaria.

The more common translation is \"miracles\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> seems to address this explicitly in \"The Essay on Resurrection\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My endeavor, and that of the select keen-minded people, differs from the quest of the masses. They like nothing better and, in their silliness, enjoy nothing more, than to set the Law and reason at opposite ends, and to move everything far from the explicable. So they claim it to be a miracle, and they shrink from identifying it as a natural incident, whether it is something that happened in the past and is recorded, or something predicted to happen in the future. But I try to reconcile the Law and reason, and wherever possible consider all things as of the natural order. <strong>Only when something is explicitly identified as a miracle, and reinterpretation of it cannot be accommodated, only then I feel forced to grant that this is a miracle.</strong></p>\n<p>(Halkin translation p. 223, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However he does report about the activities of the Patriarchs. These stories are found in the Jewish Bible, however not with many of the descriptions found in Josephus' work.</p>\n<p>For example, Josephus says of Abraham in <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0008\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Antiquities of the Jews</em>, Book I, chap. 8 sec. 2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He communicated to them arithmetic, and delivered to them the science of astronomy; for before Abram came into Egypt they were unacquainted with those parts of learning; for that science came from the Chaldeans into Egypt, and from thence to the Greeks also.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How did he know this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>On your specific example of Avraham having taught math and astronomy to the Egyptians, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Yoshiko_Reed\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Annette Yoshiko Reed</a> in her essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24669501?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A55d93ad79eac17430615636b1fe11c5e&seq=5#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abraham As Chaldean Scientist and Father of the Jews: Josephus, \"Ant.\" 1.154-168, and The Greco-Roman Discourse About Astronomy/Astrology</a>\", pg. 123, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In addition, a number of scholars have pointed to the Hellenistic Jewish precedents for Josephus' expanded account of Abraham's Egyptian sojourn (e.g., Artapanus, Pseudo-Eupolemus) and have cited these examples to illustrate his overall indebtedness to Hellenistic Jewish \"apologetic historiography\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Josephus based himself on the accounts of prior Hellenistic Jewish historians (of whose works we only have fragments quoted by later authors, such as Josephus and Eusebius).</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Eusebius in \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeparatio_Evangelica\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Praeparatio Evangelica</a>\", <a href=\"http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_09_book9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book 9</a>, quoted in relation to this passage by Josephus from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Polyhistor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alexander Polyhistor</a>'s \"Concerning the Jews\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And with this agrees also Alexander Polyhistor...in the thirteenth generation Abraham was born, who surpassed all men in nobility and wisdom, who was also the inventor of astronomy and the Chaldaic art, and pleased God well by his zeal towards religion. By reason of God's commands this man came and dwelt in Phoenicia, and pleased their king by teaching the Phoenicians the changes of the sun and moon and all things of that kind. And Abraham dwelt with the Egyptian priests in Heliopolis and taught them many things; and it was he who introduced astronomy and the other sciences to them, saying that the Babylonians and himself had found these things out, but tracing back the first discovery to Enoch, and saying that he, and not the Egyptians, had first invented astrology.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then he brings from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artapanus_of_Alexandria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artapanus of Alexandria</a>'s \"Jewish History\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Artabanus in his Jewish History says that the Jews were called Ermiuth, which when interpreted after the Greek language means Judaeans, and that they were called Hebrews from Abraham. And he, they say, came with all his household into Egypt, to Pharethothes the king of the Egyptians, and taught him astrology.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in <a href=\"http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_13_book13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book 13</a> quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orpheus</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And again concerning God, calling Him invisible, he says that He was made known only to one certain person, a Chaldaean by birth, whether he so speaks of Abraham, or of his son, in the following words:</p>\n<p>\"Save one, a scion of Chaldaean race:</p>\n<p>For he was skilled to mark the sun's bright path,</p>\n<p>And how in even circle round the earth</p>\n<p>The starry sphere on its own axis turns,</p>\n<p>And winds their chariot guide o'er sea and sky.\"\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Philo</a> also makes mention of Avraham having prior astrological knowledge in \"<a href=\"http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book22.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On Abraham</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the most visible proof of this migration in which the mind quitted astronomy and the doctrines of the Chaldaeans, is this. For it is said in the scriptures that the very moment that the wise man quitted his abode, \"God appeared unto Abraham,\" to whom, therefore, it is plain that he was not visible before, when he was adhering to the studies of the Chaldaeans, and attending to the motions of the stars, not properly comprehending any nature whatever, which was well arranged and appreciable by the intellect only, apart from the world and the essence perceptible by the outward senses.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it does not appear that the Hellenistic Jews invented this tradition, or at least not entirely. For example, we find in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book of Jubilees</a> (written prior to Josephus, perhaps the mid-2nd century BCE):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And in the sixth week, in the fifth year thereof, Abram sat up throughout the night on the new moon of the seventh month to observe the stars from the evening to the morning, in order to see what would be the character of the year with regard to the rains, and he was alone as he sat and observed.\nAnd a word came into his heart and he said: \"All the signs of the stars, and the signs of the moon and of the sun are all in the hand of the Lord. Why do I search (them) out? If He desireth, He causeth it to rain, morning and evening; And if He desireth, He withholdeth it, And all things are in His hand.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Book_of_Jubilees.12.17-19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12:17-19</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and a hinted past observance of the stars in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Abraham\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apocalypse of Abraham</a> (written circa Josephus, likely based on older material):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Nor will I place among the gods the one who obscures his course by means of the moon and the clouds. Nor again shall I call the moon or the stars gods, because they too at times during the night dim their light. Listen, Terah my father, I shall seek before you the God who created all the gods supposed by us (to exist). For who is it, or which one is it who made the heavens crimson and the sun golden, who has given light to the moon and the stars with it, who has dried the earth in the midst of the many waters, who set you yourself among the things and who has sought me out in the perplexity of my thoughts?\" (<a href=\"http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/pseudepigrapha/Apocalypse_of_Abraham.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:8-11</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and, l'havdil, we also have midrashim from our sages about Avraham's astrological/astronomical knowledge:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.156a.14-156b.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 156</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Abraham said before Him: Master of the Universe, I looked at my astrological map, and according to the configuration of my constellations I am not fit to have a son. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Emerge from your astrology, as the verse states: “And He brought him outside,” as there is no constellation for Israel. What is your thinking? Is it because Jupiter is situated in the west that you cannot have children? I will restore it and establish it in the east. And that is the meaning of that which is written with regard to Abraham: “Who has raised up one from the east, he will call justice [tzedek] to his steps [leraglo]. He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; his sword makes them as the dust, his bow as the driven stubble” (Isaiah 41:2). God established Jupiter [tzedek] in the east on behalf of [leraglo] Abraham.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.44.12?lang=bi&with=Jastrow&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 44</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And He took him outside, Rabbi Yehoshua of Sichnin in the name of Rabbi Levi [said]: \"Did He take him out of the world, as it says: \"And He took him outside\"? No, He showed him the streets of heaven, \"where is what you said, \"He had not yet made earth and fields\"\", said Rabbi Yehudah in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: \"He raised him above the dome of the expanse, as He said: \"Look at the sky\", the use of habatah indicates a looking down from above. the sages said: \"You are a prophet and not an astrologer\", as it says: \"Therefore, restore the man’s wife—since he is a prophet.\"\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Josephus himself also claims this idea can be found in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berossus</a>'s writings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Berosus mentions our father Abram without naming him, when he says thus: \"In the tenth generation after the Flood, there was among the Chaldeans a man righteous and great, and skillful in the celestial science.\"\" (<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0007\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities 1:7:2</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'll also note that ancient astrology involved many complicated mathematical calculations and knowledge of the stars, so if Avraham was an astrologer at one time, then he must have also had knowledge in mathematics and astronomy.</p>\n<p>From all of this, we may say that likely Josephus received most of his extra-Tanachic knowledge about the Patriarchs from earlier historians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, and perhaps also got some information from the texts of other Jewish denominations, or from word-of-mouth from Jews of these other groups.</p>\n\n\n",

Why? Those [that are in Leviticus, which must be read in one aliya] are said in the plural, Moses relaying them from mouth of the Almighty; and these [in Deuteronomy] are in the singular, said by Moses himself.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rashi comments there: \"Moses spoke them in the name of G-d and became a messenger to say,\" thus said the Holy One blessed be He\", for they are worded (in first person singular): and I will give ... and I will place ... and I will send, referring to the One who has the power to act; but in Mishneh Torah it is written: The Lord will strike you...

And when Rashi explains that Moshe “articulated himself,” he means that he first asked the Holy One [for permission]. </p>\n\n<p>Tosefos in Chapter Bnei Ha'ir (Megilla 31b), [commenting on the Gemora there] write, “Moshe articulated himself, and through Divine Inspiration.” </p>\n\n<p>My question is that in Rashi's comment to Megilla 31b it seems like he actually holds Moshe said the curses on his own accord in contrast to what he writes in Sanhedrin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would suggest that Rashi agrees with Tosfos that \"Mishnah Torah was said with Ruach Hakodesh\" but nevertheless the previous 4 books were on a level higher \n\"Mipi HaGevurah Mamash\".</p>\n\n<p>Also worth noting is a comment by  Rabbenu bachaye (Devarim 29:6) \n\"You should appreciate that the warnings of doom enumerated in this whole portion are Moses’ own wording as distinct from similar warnings of disaster in Leviticus chapter 26. This does not mean that Moses “made up the תוכחה by himself.” Rather, it means that the syntax used by the Torah reflects that G’d approved of the choice of words Moses had used so that effectively everything recorded in the written text of the Torah is equivalent to something dictated by G’d Himself.</p>\n\n<p>If our sages (Megillah 31) stated that the “curses contained in the Torah and which were uttered by the priests were words put in their mouths by G’d Himself,” whereas those contained in the Book of Deuteronomy reflect Moses’ words, they meant that Moses succeeded in voicing thoughts which reflected exactly what G’d would have told him to say.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that the Torah chose to write two versions of these exhortations and warnings, one being G’d’s initiative and words, the other at the initiative of Moses who had divined what G’d wanted him to say, is that the version we read at the end of the Book of Leviticus is that which became true at the time the first Temple was destroyed, whereas the longer version we read here in the Book of Deuteronomy was not fulfilled until the second Temple was being destroyed. One proof that this is so is furnished by the words (Leviticus 26,30) והשמדתי את במותיכם והכרתי את חמניכם, “I will destroy your private altars and demolish your sun-idols.” These are phenomena which existed only during the period of the first Temple when idolatry was widespread among the people during the reigns of many kings. The curses listed in Deuteronomy were all fulfilled during the collapse of the second commonwealth and its Temple.\"</p>\n\n\n",

This makes abortion in regards to your question, still an act of evil as the mother’s life was not threatened. The second answer says that if the baby’s is trying to harm the mother or in anyway harms her health, then it must be aborted. This suggest that the quality of life (sight) is important.

I saw this [substance] which is similar to Man in Al-Nasir [?], and it descends in Nissan and Iyar, not in other months. Additionally, if you put it in the sun, it does not melt. Additionally, at night it does not rot. Additionally, it is not strong, and there is no need to grind it in mortars to make cakes from it. Additionally, when it is put on the tongue it will melt. Additionally, it does not satisfy [to the point of] creating blood, it only enters medicines. Additionally, on Friday double would descend. Additionally, none would descend on Shabbat. Additionally, it would fall in every place that they camped.

And behold, it is not as they thought.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For further discussion, I would suggest reading Abarbanel (Shemot 16:14), Shadal (same location), and RDZ Hoffman (16:36), all of whom approach this topic, and all of whom would be considered \"rational\" (and some/all were Rabbis).</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, they assumed it was the <em>most</em> miraculous of miracles, on account of it being continuous for forty years. In addition to the sources I cited there, Gersonides also elaborates on this in <em>Wars of the Lord</em> Book VI Part 2 Chapter 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This accounts for the great difference between the miracles performed by Moses (may he rest in peace) and those performed by the other prophets. The former are quite encompassing, as is evident in the miracles of the plagues that spread amongst all the Egyptians. Moreover, they lasted for a longer interval; as for example, the miracles of the Manna and the columns of fire and smoke, both of which lasted some forty years. Such miracles are unique to Moses our Teacher (may he rest in peace). The miracle of the handful of meal and the little oil in the cruse that did last for some time was performed by Elijah for one woman only, nor was that time as long as the duration of the Manna and the columns of fire and smoke. Moses' miracles were extraordinary because of the continual isolation of his intellect [from the other capacities of his soul] in his apprehension, such that the providence emanating from the Agent Intellect was able to reach to him continually. Since his knowledge approximated the perfection of the Agent Intellect to a greater extent than any other prophet, the miracles performed by him were more encompassing and extraordinary. By virtue of the degree of his continual unification with the Agent Intellect these miracles lasted for a long time. This is what the Torah [itself] reveals concerning the differences betweent he miracles performed by Moses and those of the other prophets.</p>\n<p>(Feldman translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, it would be rather difficult to argue that the manna was actually a \"natural\" miracle, as if it was it wouldn't be the big deal that Maimonides and Gersonides make to out to be. Therefore, we presumably do not still see the miracle of the manna today.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is manna kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We seem to not know what manna is, yet how do we determine it is kosher? I suppose this is the case because G-d deemed it so, but what do our sources say?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>You are right and AlBerko's answer is right. Mana is kosher for each of these three reasons: because it if provided directly by Hashem, because He said to eat it, and because it is not non-kosher.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Chulin (5a) says that the meat provided to Eliyahu by the ravens was kosher because it was specifically brought to him by Hashem's word:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לימא מסייע ליה (מלכים א יז, ו) והעורבים מביאים לו לחם ובשר בבקר ולחם\n  ובשר בערב ואמר רב יהודה אמר רב מבי טבחי דאחאב על פי הדבור שאני</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara suggests: Let us say that the verse written with regard to\n  Elijah supports the opinion of Rav Anan. The verse states: “And the\n  ravens [orevim] brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread\n  and meat in the evening” (I Kings 17:6); and Rav Yehuda said that Rav\n  said: They would bring the meat from the slaughterhouse of Ahab.\n  Clearly, Elijah would not have eaten the meat if Ahab’s slaughter was\n  not valid. The Gemara responds: Since he ate the meat according to the\n  word of God, the case of Elijah is different, and no proof may be\n  cited from there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosafos there points out that according to the one who wanted to prove that Ahab's meat is kosher, not needing a special allowance, there would still be a problem of unwatched meat, and according to everyone Eliyahu relied on the fact that this was provided specially by G-d that it was kosher. </p>\n\n<p>The general rule is that all foods are kosher until made unkosher. The meat of an animal is in a general category of forbidden food until it is from a kosher animal and properly slaughtered. This is the most basic reason why mana is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the pasuk \"These are the animals\", the Gemara (Chulin 63b) explains that this is to tell us that there are more non kosher animals than kosher ones.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Mahn is a \"natural\" product. It's similar to a fruit or vegetable. It was a product that fell from the sky and was untouched by humans, in the same way that any fruit or vegetable is. It was not any type of animal that needed to be slaughtered.</p>\n\n<p>Except for the possibility of bugs and other insects, I haven't seen a single rav or kashrut org. require any hashgacha for natural unprocessed produce. As for any concern of trumah, ma'aser, etc. you'd really have to go out of your way to show that mahn is produce. Even if it were, they hadn't entered Eretz Yisra'el yet. Even for the short period that they ate mahn until the day after Pesach of being in Gilgal, they still hadn't inherited any land. </p>\n\n<p>We do know that the mahn collected worms, and, perhaps one could ask if it had to be inspected like berries and lettuce does. However, by that time, it was inedible, and all left-overs melted except on Shabbat, and then, it didn't attract bugs anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I think I've made every possible point or concern clear here, and then some...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I see no one posted my comment so I will post as an answer. </p>\n\n<p>The gemara in Sanhedrin 59b writes \"Ein davar tameh yored min hashmayim \". A non-kosher item does not descend from heaven.</p>\n\n<p>Context of the gemara (Sefaria translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara asks: Is there such a thing as meat that descends from\n  heaven? The Gemara answers: Yes, it is like this incident: As Rabbi\n  Shimon ben Ḥalafta was walking along the way, he encountered those\n  lions that were roaring at him, intending to eat him. He said: “The\n  young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God”\n  (Psalms 104:21), and they deserve to receive food. Two thighs of an\n  animal descended from heaven for him. The lions ate one of these\n  thighs, and they left the other one. He took it and entered the study\n  hall, and inquired about it: Is this thigh a kosher item or a\n  non-kosher item? The Sages said to him: Certainly it is kosher, as a\n  non-kosher item does not descend from heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In connection to that story, it is related that Rabbi Zeira asked Rabbi Abbahu: If the likeness of a donkey had descended for him, what would the halakha have been? Would it have been permitted? Rabbi Abbahu said to him: Foolish bird [yarud nala]. The Sages already said to him that a non-kosher item does not descend from heaven; therefore, it must be kosher.\"</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: anything that descends from heaven is kosher and manna is no exception. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# During the Second Temple period, did the High Priest wear an additional crown on their headdress?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The High Priest's headdress was to be made of fine linen on which a gold plate was attached:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup>36</sup> You shall make a frontlet of pure gold and engrave on it the seal inscription: \"Holy to the LORD.\" <sup>37</sup> Suspend it on a cord of blue, so that it may remain on the headdress; it shall remain on the front of the headdress. <sup>38</sup> It shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may take away any sin arising from the holy things that the Israelites consecrate, from any of their sacred donations; it shall be on his forehead at all times, to win acceptance for them before the LORD. <sup>39</sup> You shall make the fringed tunic of fine linen. You shall make the headdress of fine linen. You shall make the sash of embroidered work. (Exodus 28) [NJPS]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus describes the garments and headdress of the High Priest. He gives a very detailed description of a crown worn above the inscribed gold plate:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>172 His head-dress was the same as that described earlier and made like that of all the other priests, <strong>but above it was another</strong>, embroidered in blue and round it a golden crown, in three rows, from which arose a cup of gold like the herb we call Saccharus, but which is called Hyoscyamus by Greeks who are skilled in the cutting of roots. 173 In case anyone has seen this herb but has not learned its name or is unaware of its nature, or, though knowing the name does not know the herb when he sees it, I shall now describe it. 174 This herb is often more than three hands-width tall, but its root is like that of a turnip, to which it may fairly be compared, but its leaves are like those of mint. From its branches it sends out a calyx joined to the branch, surrounded with a jacket which it naturally sheds when it begins to turn into fruit. The calyx is as large as the bone of the little finger, but its opening is like a cup. I will describe it further, for those who are unfamiliar with it. 175 Imagine a sphere cut in half, round at the bottom, but with another segment growing up from that base and gradually narrowing and then gracefully widening again at the top, such as in the indented navel of a pomegranate. 176 The plant is surmounted by a top that makes it hemispherical as though carefully turned on a lathe, with notches above it, as I said, like a pomegranate, prickly and ending in a sharp point. 177 The fruit is protected within the coat of the calyx, and is like the seed of the herb Sideritis and sends out a flower which can resemble a poppy. 178 Of this the crown was made, from the back of the head to the temples on either side, but this Ephielis, as the calyx may be called, <strong>did not cover the forehead, which was covered with a golden plate, inscribed with the name of God in sacred characters</strong>. Such is the adornment of the high priest.

Place [one] on the head of the of High Priest Joshua son of Jehozadak...The crowns shall remain in the Temple of the LORD as a memorial to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah. (Zechariah 6:11, 15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>During the Second Temple period, did the High Priest continue to wear the crown which was made for Joshua?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Moses have a ten-cubit-long axe?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=54b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 54b</a> relates the following tale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבן שבקש עוג מלך הבשן לזרוק על ישראל גמרא גמירי לה אמר מחנה ישראל כמה הוי תלתא פרסי איזיל ואיעקר טורא בר תלתא פרסי ואישדי עלייהו ואיקטלינהו אזל עקר טורא בר תלתא פרסי ואייתי על רישיה ואייתי קודשא בריך הוא עליה קמצי ונקבוה ונחית בצואריה הוה בעי למשלפה משכי שיניה להאי גיסא ולהאי גיסא ולא מצי למשלפה והיינו דכתיב שני רשעים שברת וכדר' שמעון בן לקיש דא\"ר שמעון בן לקיש מאי דכתיב שני רשעים שברת אל תקרי שברת אלא שרבבת משה כמה הוה עשר אמות שקיל נרגא בר עשר אמין שוור עשר אמין ומחייה בקרסוליה וקטליה</p>\n<p>'The stone which Og, king of Bashan wanted to throw at Israel'. This has been handed down by tradition. He said: How large is the camp of Israel? Three parasangs. I will go and uproot a mountain of the size of three parasangs and cast it upon them and kill them. He went and uprooted a mountain of the size of three parasangs and carried it on his head. But the Holy One, blessed be He, sent ants which bored a hole in it, so that it sank around his neck. He tried to pull it off, but his teeth projected on each side, and he could not pull it off. This is referred to in the text, Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked,  as explained by R Simeon b. Lakish. For R. Simeon b. Lakish said: What is the meaning of the text, Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked? Do not read, shibbarta [Thou hast broken], but shirbabta [Thou hast lengthened]. The height of Moses was ten cubits.  He took an axe ten cubits long, leapt ten cubits into the air, and struck him on his ankle and killed him.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_54.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A ten-cubit-long axe is not exactly a common household item. So I am wondering how Moses just happened to have such an axe? Was this just a random coincidence? Did he always have the axe for some reason? Did he fashion the axe at the moment in order to fight Og? Did the axe miraculously appear? Some other option?</p>\n<p>Note: Obviously this question only makes sense if the Talmudic tale is to be taken literally.

And I thought after awakening that I would never see this dog again. Initially I thought it was my old dog, but it became clear after waking up to hear the news from my father. Could the dog be her, leashed by the angel of death?</p>\n\n<p>She was a very self-sacrificing woman and the week before her passing this aspect became strongly manifest in our lives. My near sibling was found out to have stolen a lot of family money to pay for her friends’ expenses and I walked 15 kilometres out of mesiras nefesh in hopes of helping a yid.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the week of a tzaddik’s passing, for example, is punctuated with another stage of elevation for his disciples.

My Rav said these things are concealed from us but I believe it may be closer to our finger tips than we think.

Presumably that means that even though they'll appoint someone else soon after. If I'm reading that right, that means that a kohen gadol who began his tenure after the exile started can't end the exile.</p>\n\n<p>So philosophically that works -- <strong>if you've ever served as kohen gadol, you're on a higher level of responsibility for the rest of your life.</strong> Both vis-a-vis God (the Gemara) and how people perceive you (Chizkuni). Chizkuni's reason fits especially well that it's the time of the verdict, as we're concerned with people complaining about the kohen gadol not carrying out justice. </p>\n\n<p>(With the Gemara's reason that he should have begged for mercy ... you'd think that would align with the time of the death and not the time of the verdict, but until there's a verdict there's no exile, I suppose ...) </p>\n\n\n",

Even if we can learn some good practices from those stories, it could be written far more clearly and practically as explicit instructions. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, long pages bear seemingly no practical information (Nesi'im sacrifices, repetitions of stories, like Eliezer's), and tons of critical halachic information is missing (prohibition of relations with one's daughter) or learned indirectly (marrying by money - קיחה קיחה).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.60.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabbah 60:8</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָמַר רַבִּי אַחָא יָפָה שִׂיחָתָן שֶׁל עַבְדֵי בָּתֵּי אָבוֹת מִתּוֹרָתָן שֶׁל בָּנִים, פָּרָשָׁתוֹ שֶׁל אֱלִיעֶזֶר שְׁנַיִם וּשְׁלשָׁה דַפִּים הוּא אוֹמְרָהּ וְשׁוֹנָהּ, וְשֶׁרֶץ מִגּוּפֵי תּוֹרָה וְאֵין דָּמוֹ מְטַמֵּא כִּבְשָׂרוֹ אֶלָּא מֵרִבּוּי הַמִּקְרָא.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Aha said, \"The conversation of the servants of the forefathers' houses is more beautiful than the Torah of their sons. The passage of Eliezer takes up two or three columns and is stated and repeated. However, the rules regarding creeping creatures is a fundamental Torah rule, and the fact that its blood does not impart impurity as its flesh does is only derived from extra words used in the verse.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Ahron Lichtenstein explained this <em>medrash</em> <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/he/%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as follows</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בתורה ניתן למצוא שתי דרכי הנהגה. האחת מנוסחת בלשון מצווה, ומפרטת את המעשים השונים שעל האדם לנהוג בהם או לחדול מהם. השניה מיוצגת בדמותם של אנשים שמעשיהם, הנהגותיהם ואורחות חייהם אמורים לכוון את דרכנו. לעתים, הצגת הדמות החיה, משפיעה ומדריכה הרבה יותר מניסוח אורחותיה בדרך של מצווה. במיוחד נכונים הדברים לגבי המצוות שבין אדם לחברו, שלגביהן קשה לקבוע מראש גדרים ברורים ומדוייקים. אכן, התורה אינה מותירה שיקול דעת מוחלט לאדם כיצד ינהג ביחסיו עם בני האדם, ואף על פי כן אין היא פורטת את כל ההוראות שיכוונו את התנהגותו בכל מצב ומצב אליו ייקלע במהלך חייו.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The Torah contains two sources of behavior. One is described in terms of <em>mitvot</em>, which details the various actions that a person should either do or refrain from doing. The second is represented in people whose deeds, behavior and lives are supposed to direct us. Often, presenting a living example can impact and affect much more than simple writing out their modes of behavior as <em>mitzvah</em>. This is certainly true with reference to interpersonal <em>mitzvot</em>, which are difficult to define <em>a priori</em> with clear and precise rules. Yes, the Torah does not leave a person to totally apply his own judgment as to how to behave with others. Nevertheless, it also does not spell out in great detail every instruction that will direct someone's behavior in every situation in which he finds himself during his life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to explain how, for example, Yosef was prevented from sinning due to 'seeing' the image of his father, rather than remembering the laws of <em>arayot</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

G-d or Moses?</strong></p>\n<p>Bible critics insist that neither G-d nor Moses authored Deuteronomy. They posit that Deuteronomy was composed during the time of the first Temple period by King Josiah (640–609 B.C.E.), following the early second Temple period\nby Ezra the Scribe. This may not be true.</p>\n<p>Was the Pentateuch authored by G-d? The Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 31b, says that G-d wrote Leviticus while Moses wrote Deuteronomy, respectively. The Babylonian Talmud, Bava Bathra 88b, agrees that Moses composed Deuteronomy. It recalls that G-d blessed the Israelites with twenty-two letters and cursed them with eight. Moses reversed the numbers.</p>\n<p>The Zohar to Vaethanan says that, “Deuteronomy was written by Moses himself.\" It was, essentially, “the oral law.\" Rabbi Judah Loew, agrees that Deuteronomy is Moses' wording. Abraham ibn Ezra felt that not all of scripture was composed by Moses (more on this later). Some of it was written later with “divine prophecy.” He explains that the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments, in Exodus was divine while Deuteronomy is Moses’ “explanation” of the Decalogue.</p>\n<p>Nachmanides explains in his commentary to Deuteronomy that whenever Moses mentions the commands, he is issuing G-d's laws. However, when he repeats or explains the laws, he is presenting us with his own opinion. Isaac ben Joseph Caro, in his book Toledot Yitzhak, recalls the Mishnah Sanhedrin and the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 99a, which explains that Moses did not write Deuteronomy of his own initiative.</p>\n<p>The Mishnah states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The following have no portion [in the world to come]....He who maintains that...the Torah was not divinely revealed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And even if he asserts that the entire Torah is from heaven, except for a particular verse, which [he insists] was not uttered by G-d but by Moses [he is deprived of the world to come].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To reconcile this seemingly inconsistency, Caro wrote that the position of the Sanhedrin only applies to the first four Pentateuchal books. Yet he explains that Deuteronomy is Moses' explanation and that G-d insisted that he record them (Nachmanides).</p>\n<p>Don Isaac Abravanel disagreed. He felt that every last letter, including Deuteronomy “comes from the mouth of the Almighty: G-d commanded that it be written word for word.”</p>\n<p><strong>Ibn Ezra’s “Secret of the Twelve”</strong></p>\n<p>In his commentary, Ibn Ezra addresses the question of whether or not Moses penned the entire Torah. The twelve verses of Deuteronomy chapter 34 inform us of Moses's death. Moses ascends Mount Nebo and peers over the promised land, the future land of Israel. After his death, Joshua succeeded him, and while no prophet, led the Jews to victory over Cannan. The problem is that the final 8 verses continue from Moses's death and aftermath.</p>\n<p>In his introduction to Chelek, Maimonides lists thirteen fundamental principles of Judaism, one of them (the eighth) being the belief that Moses wrote the entire Torah. That we possess the same Torah that was given by G-d through Moses. However, Yeshayahu Leibowitz posists that Maimonides did not bealive in all of the 13 principles, writing them only for the masses.</p>\n<p>Rashi quotes the Talmud, Bava Batra 15a and Menachot 30a, and Midrash Sifre, that it is possible that Moses wrote verse 5 and Joshua wrote the rest (Rabbi Yehuda or Rabbi Nehemiah). Rabbi Meyer disagreed, writing that “The Holy One, blessed be He, spoke, and Moses wrote with tears.” Yet, how can Moses write the remaining verses if Moses did not descend the mountain to report. The only plausible answer, perhaps, is that Joshua knew and wrote the remaining twelve passages through prophecy. This is reasonable and probably the most likely.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra’s “secret of the twelve” can also refer to other Deuteronomy passages, such as\n1:2. Josef Bonfils in his Zophnat Panei’ach, explains that Moses may not have written Deuteronomy 1:1, since it speaks of the “other side of the Jordan.” He also cites Deuteronomy 31:9, Deuteronomy 3:11, and Deuteronomy 27:1.</p>\n<p>Baruch Spinoza, in his Tractatus Theologico-Publicus mentions ibn Ezra‘s “secret of the twelve,” where he insists that Ezra would agree with him, writing,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“From what has been said, it is clearer than the sun at noonday that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses, but by someone who lived long after\nhim.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>We have seen three possibilities regarding the authorship and authenticity of the Torah. One is atheistic, the view of Spinoza. The other is the more traditional view, that G-d communicated the Torah, including Deuteronomy. The final view (most likely) is that Moses wrote Deuteronomy, concluding with Joshua through prophecy.</p>\n<p>Does the idea that Moses penned Deuteronomy eliminate the sanctity of the Torah? Or, is the wisdom of the Torah inspired by G-d? Indeed, Rabbi Joseph ben Eliezer of Saragossa said, “what difference is it to me if Moses wrote it or another prophet wrote it, since the words of them all are true and by prophecy?”[1]</p>\n<p>[1] Safenat Pa`neah, vol.

Hillel used to say: <strong>be of the disciples of Aharon, loving peace and pursuing peace</strong>, loving mankind and drawing them close to the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi then proceeds to give a detailed description as to the process Aharon took. He writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשהיה רואה שנים מריבים זה את זה. היה הולך לכל אחד ואחד שלא מדעת חברו ואומר לו: פלוני, ראה, למה אתה מריב עם פלוני? הלוא הוא נשתטח לפני ופיסני לבוא אצלך לדבר עמך עליו, עד שתתרצה להתפייס עמו. וכמו כן היה מדבר לחברו. ומתוך דברים הללו היה משים שלום ביניהם. אמר אחד לאשתו: קונם שאין נהנית לי עד שתרק בעינו של כהן גדול. היה אהרן שומע, היה הולך אצל אותה אשה והיה אומר: פלוניתא, חשתי בעיני, ורק שלך רפואה יש בו. תרק לי בעין. והיתה רוקקת. ועל כן נאמר בו (במדבר כ:כט) \"ויבכו את אהרן שלשים יום כל בית ישראל\" - אחד אנשים ואחד נשים במשמע, ובמשה לא נאמר אלא \"בני ישראל\", כדכתיב (דברים לד:ח) ויבכו בני ישראל את משה</p>\n<p>When he saw two people fighting this one and that one, he would go to each one without each one's friend knowing and say to him: \"Ploni - see, why are you fighting with ploni? Did he not come and prostrate himself before me and appease me to come to you to speak with you about him, until you will want to reconcile with him\". And similarly he would speak to the other friend. And through these words, he created peace between them. One would say to his wife: \"You won't benefit from me until you spit in the eye of a high priest.\" Aharon would hear and he would go by the woman and say: \"Plonisa - I am worried about my eye and only you have the cure/medicine for it - spit in my eye.\" And she would spit. And therefore, that's why it says: \"All of the house of Israel cried about Aharon for thirty days\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.20.29?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 20:29</a>), implying both the men and the women. Whereas by Moshe it only says the \"Children (Bnei) of Israel like it writes: \"And the children of Israel cried...for thirty days\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.34.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 34:8</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Kallah_Rabbati.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kallah Rabbasi 3</a> which aside from bringing a similar scenario listed by Rashi also adds about how Aharon would intervene with quarrelling spouses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When [Aaron] heard of a husband and wife who had quarrelled, he would go to the husband and say to him, ‘[I have come] because I heard that you have quarrelled with your wife; should you divorce her it is doubtful whether you will find another like her or not; and further, should you find another and quarrel with her, the first thing she will say to you will be, “You must have behaved in a like manner towards your first wife” ’. In consequence of this all Israel, men and women, loved him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, such was his success with making peace amongst husband and wives it is worth noting parenthetically (a few lines on in the Kallah Rabbasi):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eighty thousand young men named Aaron followed Aaron’s bier. They were the issue of those who wanted to divorce but retracted and their wives became pregnant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. they named their resulting sons Aharon out of gratitude to him for saving their marriages!!</p>\n\n\n",

He does not specify what forms of Torah he is referring to. <strong>The other tanna does not state that teaching girls Torah is forbidden;</strong> rather, he states that teaching girls Torah has a negative consequence.</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, when Rambam codifies this law  (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=172\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Talmud Torah 1:13</a>) he writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואע\"פ שיש לה שכר צוו חכמים שלא ילמד אדם את בתו תורה מפני שרוב הנשים אין דעתם מכוונת להתלמד אלא הן מוציאות דברי תורה לדברי הבאי לפי עניות דעתן אמרו חכמים כל המלמד את בתו תורה כאילו למדה תפלות</p>\n<p>Even though she will receive a reward, the Sages commanded that a person should not teach his daughter Torah, because most women cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding.</p>\n<p>[Thus,] our Sages declared: \"Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches her tales and parables.\"</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910973/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam here explicitly states that the Sages commanded one to not teach his daughter Torah. Yet as I mentioned above, the Mishnah does not actually seem to say that. It just presents the tannaic opinion that there is a negative effect of teaching Torah to women.</p>\n<p>How, then, did Rambam extend this to say that the Sages actually issued a command to not teach them?</p>\n<p>I am aware that in the parallel passage in the Jerusalem Talmud, an opinion is presented which states that the Torah should be burned rather than given to women, which is somewhat closer to a \"command\" to not teach them. However, I did not see the standard Rambam commentaries cite the Jerusalem Talmud as Rambam's source for this statement; they cited the version in the Babylonian Talmud which does not say this.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>So did Rambam have a different version of the text in Sotah that did in fact say that the Sages commanded to not teach women Torah? Did he somehow extrapolate this command from the text that we have, even though it does not appear to say that? Was there some other external source that he was referring to?</p>\n<p>It is perhaps noteworthy that he first says that they commanded not to teach women and only then mentions the statement that teaching them is like teaching them <em>tiflut</em>, perhaps implying that these are two separate things.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

In our mishnah (27:3), we learn that a more stringent material can help make up the minimum size of a less stringent material, but not the other way around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.27.3?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Bartenura's commentary</a>, however, limits this to the combinations mentioned in the mishnah, which are combinations of adjacent materials in the list of cloth, sack-cloth, leather, matting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודוקא כסדר הזה הכתוב במשנה מצטרפין לקל שבהן, הבגד והשק, השק והעור, העור והמפץ. אבל בגד ועור, או בגד ומפץ, או שק ומפץ, אין מצטרפין, דהמחברן בטלה דעתו אצל כל אדם. ומיהו לעשות מהן טלאי על גבי מרדעת של חמור, כולן מצטרפין, דמאיזה מהן שיקצע טפח ויעשה אותו טלאי למרדעת של חמור, מצטרף, דאינו מקפיד לשם אם הוא משני מינים:</p>\n<p>And they combine specifically in the order mentioned in the mishnah... but [the other combinations] do not combine, since the intention of the one who joins them is irrelevant in the face of people's usual intentions (בטלה דעתו אצל כל אדם). But when making a covering for a donkey's saddle, they all combine, since one can cut off any handbreath [squared] piece from the [combined] material and make a covering for a donkey's saddle, it combines since one doesn't mind if [the material] is of two different types.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't understand the reasoning for limiting the combinations. We might infer from the last sentence that people don't care if there are two types of material in their saddle coverings that people <em>do</em> care (in the first clause) if their other cloth-like objects are of two materials; but then why do even two adjacent materials combine, if the result is of two different materials? What is the Bartenura's source for his explanation?</p>\n\n\n",

Otherwise, what is meant by the usage of \"halacha\" here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Several commentators prove that it does not mean \"<em>halacha</em>\" in the regular sense of a law or a directive.</p>\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 31a</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן לא יפטר אדם מחברו לא מתוך שיחה ולא מתוך שחוק ולא מתוך קלות ראש ולא מתוך דברים בטלים אלא מתוך דבר הלכה שכן מצינו בנביאים הראשונים שסיימו דבריהם בדברי שבח ותנחומים וכן תנא מרי בר בריה דרב הונא בריה דר' ירמיה בר אבא אל יפטר אדם מחבירו אלא מתוך דבר הלכה שמתוך כך זוכרהו כי הא דרב כהנא אלוייה לרב שימי בר אשי מפום נהרא עד בי צניתא דבבל כי מטא להתם א\"ל מר ודאי דאמרי אינשי הני צניתא דבבל איתנהו מאדם הראשון ועד השתא א\"ל אדכרתן מילתא דרבי יוסי ברבי חנינא דאמר ר' יוסי ברבי חנינא מאי דכתיב בארץ אשר לא עבר בה איש ולא ישב אדם שם וכי מאחר דלא עבר היאך ישב אלא לומר לך כל ארץ שגזר עליה אדם הראשון לישוב נתישבה וכל ארץ שלא גזר עליה אדם הראשון לישוב לא נתישבה</p>\n<p>Similarly a man before taking leave of his fellow should not finish off with ordinary conversation, or joking, or frivolity, or idle talk, but with some matter of halachah. For so we find with the early prophets that they concluded their harangues with words of praise and comfort; and so Mari the grandson of R. Huna the son of R. Jeremiah b. Abba learnt: Before taking leave of his fellow a man should always finish with a matter of halachah, so that he should remember him thereby. So we find that R. Kahana escorted R. Shimi b. Ashi from Pun, to Be-Zinyatha of Babylon, and when he arrived there he said to him, Sir, do people really say that these palm trees of Babylon are from the time of Adam? — He replied: You have reminded me of the saying of R. Jose son of R. Hanina. For R. Jose son of R. Hanina said: What is meant by the verse, Through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt?  If no one passed, how could anyone dwell? It is to teach you that any land which Adam decreed should be inhabited is inhabited, and any land which Adam decreed should not be inhabited is not inhabited.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_31.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem here is that though it states that one should depart amid a matter of <em>halacha</em>, the example it gives is decidedly non-halachic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Tzvi Hirsch Chajes</a> in his commentary there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עי' ברבינו יונה שלא גרס כאן מתוך דבר הלכה ואולי דאין נכון הראי' מר' כהנא שלא הגיד לו דבר הלכה רק דבר אגדה דכל ארץ שלא גזר אדה\"ר לישוב לא נתישב אכן מצינו ג\"כ הפ' עניני אגדה מכונים בלשון הלכה כמו (סנהדרין ק\"ד ע\"ב) נתעלמה ממנו הלכה אבר אחד יש באדם וכו' ובאמת בערוך ערך אבר השמיט גם שם תיבת הלכה וגרס נתעלמה ממנו אבר אחד יש באדם וכו' ובאמת בערוך ערך אבר השמיט גם שם תיבת הלכה וגרס נתעלמה ממנו אבר אחד יש באדם אבל ראיתי בספרי פ' בהעלותך פיסקא איש איש כי יהיה טמא לנפש הביאו רש\"י בחומש פ' וישלח נקוד על וישקהו הלכה בידוע שעשו שונא ליעקב ע\"ש הרי דגם על עניני אגדה נופל שם הלכה</p>\n<p>See in Rabbeinu Yonah that he does not have the text \"from amid a matter of <em>halacha</em>”, and perhaps because it would not be a proper proof from R. Kahana who did not tell him a matter of <em>halacha</em> but a matter of <em>aggadah</em> that any land that Adam the first did not decree to settle was not settled. However, we find also that the explanation of aggadic matters are nicknamed with the wording <em>halacha</em> such as  (Sanhedrin 104b) \"the <em>halacha</em> that a man has a small organ was hidden from him etc.\" And in truth the Aruch section \"<em>Ever</em>\" left out also there the word <em>halacha</em>, and has the text as \"[that] a man has a small limb was hidden from him\". But I saw in Sifrei Parshat Beha'alotcha [in the] section \"each man when he becomes impure from a body\", cited by Rashi on Chumash [in] Parshat  Vayishlach, \"there are dots on [the word] <em>and he kissed him</em> [because] it is a <em>halacha</em> that it is known that Esau hates Jacob\" see there. Behold even on  matters of <em>aggadah</em> the name <em>halacha</em> is applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Baruch Halevi Epstein</a> writes in Torah Temimah to Numbers 27:21 Note 35:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורש\"י פירש שאמר הקב\"ה שישאל יהושע ממנו דבר הלכה וצ\"ל דהלשון דבר הלכה לאו דוקא הלכה ממש באיסור והיתר וכדומה שהרי עמידה זו דאיירי כאן היא בענין שאלות באורים ותומים ורש\"י עצמו כתב בעירובין מ\"ה א' דשאלות איסור והיתר אין שואלין באו\"ת [והטעם פשוט משום דלא בשמים היא] אלא הכונה לשאול לו דבר הלכה בעניני והנהגות העולם כמו בדבר מלחמת הארץ וחלוקתה וכדומה</p>\n<p>ובאמת מצינו לחז\"ל שקורים גם לאגדות וידיעות שונות בשם הלכה כמו בברכות ל\"א א' אל יפטר אדם מחבירו אלא מתוך דבר הלכה ומביא למשל על זה ענין אגדי ובסנהדרין ק\"ז א' נתעלמה ממנו הלכה אבר קטן יש באדם וכו' ורש\"י פ' וישלח בפסוק וישקהו מביא ממדרש הלכה בידוע שעשו שונא ליעקב וא\"כ לא יפלא אם גם עניני ישראל בכלל והידיעות להם יכונו בשם הלכה</p>\n<p>And Rashi explains that God said that Joshua would ask of him a matter of <em>halacha</em>. And we have to say that the wording of \"a matter of <em>halacha</em> does not literally mean an actual law about the forbidden or permissible and the like, for this standing that we are dealing with here was with regard to questions for the <em>Urim V'tumim</em>, and Rashi himself wrote in Eruvin 45a that questions of the forbidden and the permissible cannot be asked to the <em>Urim V'tumim</em> (and the reason is obvious, because the Torah is not in heaven). Rather the intent is to ask him a matter of <em>halacha</em> in the matters and operations of the world, like by the matter of the war for the land and its division and the like.</p>\n<p>And in truth we find that the Sages of blessed memory call even <em>aggadot</em> and various facts with the name <em>halacha</em>, such as in Berachot 31a [which says] \"a man should not part from his fellow except amid a matter of halacha\", and it cites as an example a matter of <em>aggadah</em>. And in Sanhedrin 107a (where it says) \"the <em>halacha</em> that a man has a small organ etc. was hidden from him\". And Rashi in Parshat Vayishlach on the verse \"and he kissed him\" cites from a Midrash that \"it is a <em>halacha</em> that it is known that Esau hates Jacob\". And if so, it is not astounding if even the matters of Israel in general, and the facts relating to them, are nicknamed with the name <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, both of these commentators demonstrate that the term <em>halacha</em> need not necessarily refer to a legal matter, and they both cite your case as proof.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I remember hearing [I think in the name of Reb Menachem Zemba ZT\"L] that הלכה in this case means, a rule without a given reason, as in הלכה למשה מסיני, not based on anything other than Hashem's will.

He explained: Reb Shimon is usually\n  the one who follows the reason behind the Torah laws, yet here Reb\n  Shimon is forced to tell us that the hatred is without any good rhyme\n  or reason, like a indisputable Halacha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>In a response, R. Moshe Feinstein touch this in a way that explains the intention of the word halacha here:</p>\n\n<p>שו\"ת אגרות משה חושן משפט חלק ב סימן עז</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כבר אמרתי על הלשון שהביא רש\"י בפי' החומש פ' וישלח (ל\"ג, ד') על קרא\n  דוישקהו ארשב\"י הלכה היא בידוע שעשו שונא ליעקב דמה שייך זה להלכה,\n  <strong>דהוא כמו שהלכה לא משתנית כך שנאת עשו ליעקב לא משתנית דאף אלו שנוהגות באופן טוב שנאתן גדולה בעצם.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And why is the word halacha [and its meaning] here?  It is because just as\n  halacha never changes, so also Esav’s hatred of Yaakov never changes. \n  Even in those [nations] that behave well [toward Jews], their hatred\n  [of Jews] is actually strong.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did God not accept the people's repentance in the days of King Yoshiyahu?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After a disastrous 57 years (the reigns of Menashe and his son Amon), during which idolatry was rampant in Judah and Judaism was threatened with extinction, the good king Yoshiyahu comes on the scene and engineers a broad revival of the faith.  But the prophetess Huldah tells him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus said the Lord God of Israel…  “Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants ... Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, … my anger is kindled against this place…”</p>\n<p>And they brought back the reply to the king. And the king… gathered… all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem and… went up to the house of the Lord… and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord. And [they]… made a covenant…to keep [God’s] commandments… with all their heart and all their soul…  [2 Kings 22:11~17, 23:1-3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The people clearly repent and resolve to reform under Yoshiyahu's leadership.  But God says He will bring disaster on their heads anyway.  Why?  If God did not punish them during Menashe's reign, it must have been to give them opportunities to repent.  And they did.  So why did God resolve to punish them anyway?  Isn't repentance what God really wants?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Eikhah Rabba 1:53, the \"repentance\" was not complete. Apparently they agreed with the elimination of state sponsored or public idolatry, but when it came to their own homes, many schemed to get past the king's laws:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והוא לא היה יודע שכל דורו עובדי עבודת כוכבים היו? הוה משלח זוג תלמידים למיבערא עבודת כוכבים מבתיהון, והוון עללין ולא משכחין כלום. עד דנפקון אמרון טרודו תרעין מן דהוון טרדין לתרעיה, הוון חמן יתיה אמרו עליהון: מן דאתא ותיקן הוא, דאתא וקלקל</p>\n<p>... and he [Yoshiyahu] did not know that his entire generation worshipped idols. What did the scoffers of his generation do? They would put half of the [idolatrous] form on one door, and half on the other door. [Yoshiyahu] would send two wise men to purge their homes from idols. They would enter, but find nothing. As they left, [the scoffers] would have them close the door, so that, on the inside, the idols would be reattached.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though changing the complexion of the thoroughfare was no small thing, Yoshiyahu ends up paying for his overconfidence. He should have consulted with Yirmiyahu, who would have told him to let Par'oh Necho travel through Israel. (Taanis 22b) After all, the navi's advice wouldn't be based on guessing what the state of the public mind was.</p>\n<p>The medrash continues.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפיכך, (דה\"ב ל\"ה) ויורו היורים למלך יאשיהו אמר רבי מני: שלש מאות חצים הורו בו, עד שנעשה גופו ככברה, והיה ירמיהו מצית אחריו לידע מהו אומר, ומה היה אומר? צדיק הוא ה' כי פיהו מריתי, פיהו ופום סרסורו.</p>\n<p>Therefore \"The archers shot into King Yoshiyahu\" (Divrei haYamim 35). Rabbi Mani said, \"They shot 300 arrows into him, until his body became like a sieve. Yirmiyahu stayed after with him to know what he was saying. And what was he saying, \"Hashem is just, because I rebelled against His Word.\" His Word, and the word of His emissary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(C.f. Moed Qatan 28b, which also uses the gruesome \"like a sieve\" imagery.)</p>\n<p>This story is reflected by Ashkenazim in a qinah written by R Eliezer haKalir,* \"Eikhah Eli Qonenu\". It is an alef-beis acrostic, and the dalet line reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דָּבַק בּוֹ חֵטְא לֵיצָנֵי הַדּוֹר. אֲשֶׁר קָמוּ אַחַר הַדֶּלֶת לִסְדֹּר</p>\n<p>The sin of the scoffers of the generation attached itself to him; that they established to be set up behind the door.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to some up: There was national repentance, but not enough individuals cleaned up their personal lives. And Yoshiahu, in his hubris, was so sure of his own success, he didn't even think the question was worth asking the navi.</p>\n<p>(* If a Sepharadi can mention whether they say something similar, it would be appreciated.)</p>\n\n\n",

Based on what sources? If you look at the verse in Breishit, Esav kissed Jacob. Yes, I see Rashi's citation of Sifrei that implies that the kiss was sincere and it was only this time that he meant it. But, in a reading from the rest of the Torah, we don't find any situation were Esav attacked or was in any way hostile to Ya'akov or B'nai Yisra'el.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that they were satisfied to be left alone. In parshat Chukat, we see that Moshe sent messengers requesting passage through their land, Edom, and they refused ans even set out against them \"with a heavy force\". However, this seems to be a defensive maneuver to discourage B'nai Yisra'el from passing through their land. I.e., they didn't actively bother B'nai Yisra'el in the desert or wage war against them.</p>\n\n<p>So, how or why does R.

    "content": "# Health benefits for eating kosher\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are some health benefits for a kosher diet? The Rambam and ibn Ezra said that all the mitzvahs has to have a rational explanation for them. Ibn Ezra said that if a single commandment went against reason (intelligence) then we should not observe it. That is to say, that he found a real reason for each and every command. A kosher diet should have health benefits like a bris. What does our sages’ have to say regarding this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rambam does indeed explain the health benefits of the various kosher laws in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:48:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I maintain that the food which is forbidden by the Law is unwholesome. There is nothing among the forbidden kinds of food whose injurious character is doubted, except pork (Lev. xi. 7), and fat (ibid. vii. 23). But also in these cases the doubt is not justified. For pork contains more moisture than necessary [for human food], and too much of superfluous matter. The principal reason why the Law forbids swine's flesh is to be found in the circumstance that its habits and its food are very dirty and loathsome. It has already been pointed out how emphatically the Law enjoins the removal of the sight of loathsome objects, even in the field and in the camp; how much more objectionable is such a sight in towns. But if it were allowed to eat swine's flesh, the streets and houses would be more dirty than any cesspool, as may be seen at present in the country of the Franks. A saying of our Sages declares: \"The mouth of a swine is as dirty as dung itself\" (B. T. Ber. 25a).</p>\n<p>The fat of the intestines makes us full, interrupts our digestion, and produces cold and thick blood; it is more fit for fuel [than for human food].</p>\n<p>Blood (Lev. xvii. 12), and nebelah, i.e., the flesh of an animal that died of itself (Deut. xiv. 21), are indigestible, and injurious as food; Trefah, an animal in a diseased state (Exod. xxii. 30), is on the way of becoming a nebelah.</p>\n<p>The characteristics given in the Law (Lev. xi., and Deut. xiv.) of the permitted animals, viz., chewing the cud and divided hoofs for cattle, and fins and scales for fish, are in themselves neither the cause of the permission when they are present, nor of the prohibition when they are absent; but merely signs by which the recommended species of animals can be discerned from those that are forbidden.</p>\n<p>The reason why the sinew that shrank is prohibited is stated in the Law (Gen. xxxii. 33).</p>\n<p>It is prohibited to cut off a limb of a living animal and eat it, because such act would produce cruelty, and develop it: besides, the heathen kings used to do it: it was also a kind of idolatrous worship to cut off a certain limb of a living animal and to eat it.</p>\n<p>Meat boiled in milk is undoubtedly gross food, and makes overfull; but I think that most probably it is also prohibited because it is somehow connected with idolatry, forming perhaps part of the service, or being used on some festival of the heathen. I find a support for this view in the circumstance that the Law mentions the prohibition twice after the commandment given concerning the festivals \"Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God\" (Exod. xxiii. 17, and xxxiv. 73), as if to say, \"When you come before me on your festivals, do not seethe your food in the manner as the heathen used to do.\" This I consider as the best reason for the prohibition: but as far as I have seen the books on Sabean rites, nothing is mentioned of this custom.</p>\n<p>The commandment concerning the killing of animals is necessary, because the natural food of man consists of vegetables and of the flesh of animals: the best meat is that of animals permitted to be used as food. No doctor has any doubts about this. Since, therefore, the desire of procuring good food necessitates the slaying of animals, the Law enjoins that the death of the animal should be the easiest. It is not allowed to torment the animal by cutting the throat in a clumsy manner, by poleaxing, or by cutting off a limb whilst the animal is alive.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The\n  whole nature of a chok is based on a lack of \"logical understanding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So is it true that according to Ibn Ezra we should not follow all the commandments?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/103837/13438\">this answer</a>, Ibn Ezra writes the following in his commentary to Exodus 20:1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחלילה חלילה שתהיה מצוה אחת מהן מכחשת שקול הדעת רק אנחנו חייבים לשמור כל אשר צונו השם בין שנגלה לנו הסוד בין שלא נגלה ואם מצאנו אחת מהן מכחשת שקול הדעת אינו נכון שנאמין בו כי הוא כמשמעו רק בספרי חכמינו ז\"ל נבקש מה טעמו אם היא על דרך משל ואם לא מצאנו זה כתוב נבקש אנחנו ונחפש בכל יכלתנו אולי נוכל לתקן אותה ואם לא יכלנו נניחה כאשר היא ונודה שלא ידענו מה היה כמו ומלתם את ערלת לבבכם וכי הוא צונו שנרצחנו כאכזרי</p>\n<p>And heaven forfend that there should be a commandment, one of them, that contradicts the assessment of intelligence; we just are obligated to keep all that God commanded us, whether the secret has been revealed to us or whether it has not been revealed. And if we find one of them contradicting the assessment of intelligence it is not proper that we believe about it that it is as it sounds. Instead we should search its reason in the books of our Sages of blessed memory, [to see] if it is by way of parable. And if we do not find this written, we [ourselves] should search and seek with all our ability that we may perhaps be able to fix it. And if we are unable, we should leave it as it is and acknowledge that we don't know what it is, like [the commandment of] and you shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart — did [God] command us that we should kill ourselves like a cruel [person]?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I don’t think that this means that we only observe rational commandments. In fact, he explicitly says here that we are obligated to keep all the commandments whether or not we understand the secrets behind them. Instead, I think his point is as follows: There are certain things that are so nonsensical that we know that God could not have commanded them. If we see one of these things listed as a commandment in the Torah, we don’t reject the commandment; rather, we reject the straightforward meaning of the commandment and find an alternative meaning which will allow us to observe it. If we can’t come up with any other meaning, we still don’t reject the commandment. We can’t actually observe the commandment because we don’t know what the commandment truly is, but we acknowledge that there is a valid commandment  that we just don’t understand. So even though in practice it looks like we’re rejecting the commandment, all we’re actually doing is rejecting one meaning of the commandment, and it’s just unfortunate that our lack of understanding causes us to be unable to fulfill the commandment in the way it was intended.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra in his Yesod Morah v'sod Torah chapter 8 writes that it is impossible to know all the reasons in one shot and some mitzvos are hidden and concealed and only a few select can know the reasons. </p>\n\n<p>He also explains that if one did not observe the commandments without first knowing the reasoning then that can be compared to a child who will not eat bread until he knows how the bread came to be. If the child would hold of such a stance he would surely die,so to a Jew must follow the commandments even if he has not attained the reason for its performance. </p>\n\n<p>He goes on to explain in the other sections reasons for the mitzvos. It is evident that the Ibn Ezra stance is that every mitzvah has a true reason ,but not everyone can attain its understanding ,and one must follow all mitzvos regardless.</p>\n\n<p>Text of the Yesod:</p>\n\n<p>Treatise 8</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ההוגה תמיד בתורת ה' אם יש לו לב היא תורהו ותשכיל נפשו יותר מאשר למדוהו והשכילוהו מלמדיו וזהו (תהילים קי״ט:צ״ט) מכל מלמדי השכלתי. ומה נכבדו דברי הקדמונים שאמרו חייבים הכל לשמור כל המצות וכל התקונים שתקנום האבות ולא יבקש טעם למה צוו אלה המצוות ואמת דברו כי יש מצות רבות נפלאות ונעלמות והנה אם לא ישמרם האדם עד שידע טעמם הנה ישאר בלא תורה ויהיה נמשל לנער שלא ירצה לאכול לחם עד שידע איך בתחלה נחרש ונזרע ונקצר ונזרה והוברר ונטחן ונופה ונילש ונאפה והנה אם עושה כן ימות ברעב. רק הנכון שיאכל תמיד וכאשר יגדל ישאל מעט עד שידע כל השאלות וככה המשכיל יוכל לדעת טעמים רבים בתורה אשר הם מבוארים באר היטב ויש שהם מבוארים לאדם אחד מאלף. ומשה אדוננו ע\"ה אמר על כל המצות (דברים ד׳:ו׳) רק עם חכם ונבון הגוי הגדול הזה ואם אין להם טעמים שנוכל לדעת מה טיבם איך יאמרו העמים שהם חקים צדיקים ואנחנו השומרים אותם חכמים ואזכיר קצת הטעמים הנזכרים בתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction</a> of the Ibn Ezra's Commentary of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The following is but one quotation from it, and the rest of the Ibn Ezra's writings, that would completely contradict the notion that the Ibn Ezra would subscribe to such an opinion: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוד, מי ספר לנו כי ימי החדש על שלושים יום ספורים? כי הנה יהודה הפרסי\n  חבר ספר, ובחשבון השמש השנה והחדשים סיפר. גם לא נדע מהתורה עדות החודש,\n  ומי העד אם ילך דרך רב ביום קודש, ואם נקבל עדות אב ובנו, גרים ונשים.\n  ואילו היו כל אלה מפורשים, עוד דבר קשה, איננו מפורש בתורת משה, לדעת כמה\n  חדשי השנה. ואם היא באביב נסמכה, ההוא מחטים או משעורים? ומתי יבוקש,\n  ואנה השיעורים? ואם היתה שנת בצורת בארץ ישראל ומסביב, והנה אין זרע, אף\n  כי אביב, הנקבע השנה פשוטה או מעוברת? גם אין ספירה נספרת, ואין חג\n  שקראנוהו עצרת.</p>\n  \n  <p>וכל אלה המצוות צריכות לקבלה ומסורת. והאומרים: הנה אנשי המשנה מעידים על\n  ראיית הלבנה, ואם היא התשובה הנכונה, ואם עדותם בעיניהם נאמנה, יקבלו\n  עדות צרכי השנה, כי על פי קריאת בית דין היא נתונה, כי יסוד העיבור - על\n  אביבות התקופה וצרכי הציבור.</p>\n  \n  <p>ולמה במצוות נגע צרעת מבוארים המשפטים, שהיא מצוה לאדם אחד ולפרקים\n  מעטים, ומצות המועדים, חיוב לכל ישראל בכל זמן, ולמה אין בתורה עליהם עד\n  נאמן, רק נחפש כה וכה רמיזות, בדברי תורה תמימה כזאת?</p>\n  \n  <p>וזה לנו האות שסמך משה על תורה שבעל פה, שהיא שמחה לעצם וללב מרפא, כי\n  אין הפרש בין שתי התורות, ומידי אבותינו שתיהן לנו מסורות. ופסח חזקיהו\n  יחזיק ידי אמונה, כי נעשה על ידי בעלי עצה וזקנה, ולא הקריב הפסח במועדו,\n  ולאכול חמץ בחדש הראשון שלח ידו, ופסח שני כראשון שבעת ימים עשה, ויש\n  ראיות רבות שקבל מעשיו רם ונשא, כי בית דין היה, ואין ברוחו רמייה.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary: There are many things that prove that Moshe Rabainu relied on The Oral Torah e.g. nowhere does it say that months are thirty days (or the specifics on the Testimony of Months i.e. can a father and son testify) or how many months there are in the year, or what about a leap year if there is a famine and no \"Month Of the Spring -- Chodesh HaAviv.\"</p>\n\n<p>Considering that unless we are dealing with an area where we are supposed to use our power of reason (like the machlokes Taima d'Kra), it is axiomatic to the Oral Torah that the commandments are binding despite someone whose power of reason dictates otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Second point to consider, which is an answer in its own right:\nThe Avi Ezri -- אבי עזרי (a commentary on the אבן אזרא) in the Ibn Ezra's first commentary on Bereishis, quotes many who write that the Ibn Ezra was tampered with. So what you claim the Ibn Ezra might hold for מצוות דאורייתות actually holds for the Ibn Ezra itself i.e. if you think you are reading something \"weird\" then you either misunderstand it or the Ibn Ezra probably did not say it. This is found in many editions of the Mikraos Gedolos.</p>\n\n\n",

Consequently, if each courtyard contains two houses, the city should be considered like a walled city. The Gemara explains: If so, let the Merciful One write: “Courtyards,” without mentioning houses, as a courtyard must contain at least one house. And if you would say: If the Merciful One had written only: “Courtyards,” then one might mistakenly have concluded that the verse indicates a courtyard without a house and that if the courtyard contains a house then the city is considered walled, one could not have arrived at that conclusion, since such an area is called an enclosure [karpef ], not a courtyard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the Gemara (and the pesukim it is quoting) are dealing with houses, why would the Gemara even have the Hava Amina that the passuk could be understood to mean courtyards without houses? That contradicts the whole premise of the passuk.</p>\n<p>To even further make the question illogical, how could a place with no houses be called a city?</p>\n<p>And even if the Gemara does ask that question, why doesn’t it answer the obvious answer- that the passuk can’t be understood like that, because it is illogical and contradictory?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Passuk does not explicitly refer to a city, and it is only because it says \"houses\" that we take it to mean a settlement. The Gemara is asking how we would interpret the Passuk if it omitted the word \"houses\". Without that word, there is nothing which forces us to read it as referring to a city, and maybe we would read the Passuk to refer to a house-less settlement, basically, a clearing prepared for human use.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then says that such a clearing could not be called a חצר and the proper term would be קרפף. Therefore, if the word \"house\" had been left out the minimum would be a courtyard with one house.</p>\n\n\n",

Would we view days as progressing based on clocks, or would we view the day as forever standing still based on the Sun never setting?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are already places on Earth with months of daylight or night, depending on the season e.g., near the poles. However, the Earth still rotates, and the zmanim for the days are based on inflexion points (and other astronomical markers) of the sun throughout the 24hr day (even if the sun doesn't set on that day i.e., it remains above the horizon).</p>\n<p>If the Earth stopped rotating on its axis completely, then a particular city would be in sunlight for 6 months of the year and darkness for the other 6 months. It is unlikely that people would be expected to (for example) keep Shabbat for 6 months, or never have chaggim, or \"never grow old\", or for agricultural laws to basically cease to exist (although agriculture as we know it will cease to exist), etc.</p>\n<p>The likelihood is that the 24hr clock will be set as the new norm regardless of the daylight or night. The various zmanim will likely also be set to a standard time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The Gemorrah rules that Shabbos comes by itself and it not dependent on a Beis Din, contrary to Moadim which are dependent on Kiddush HaChodesh כדאיתא בב\"ב קכ\"א. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that \"Beit Din\" in the Gemorrah means our acting as a result of astronomical phenomena. For example, Yom Tov can only come a certain number of days after the Beis Din has ascertained that there was indeed a New Moon. This applies even nowadays, according to the Gemorrah in Rosh HaShannah. What the Gemorrah says about Yom Tov and Beis Din would be analogous to our acting due to a certain number of rotations of the earth. The Gemorrah means that Shabbos comes independant of astronomical phenomena. Therefore the answer that Shabbat comes independent of astronomical phenomena is valid.</p>\n\n<p>Answer #2:\nAlso, even if your question were at least a ספק, it isn't worse than what the Shulchan Aruch in Siman שדמ deals with (what to do if you find yourself in the desert and you aren't sure what day Shabbos is). You still have to keep Shabbos m'Chumrah. In your case, you know for sure when the last Shabbos was.</p>\n\n\n",

God created matter and the law of gravity.  That law states that each part of a blob of matter wants to go to the center of gravity of the whole blob.

    "content": "# Rashi's commentary on Deut. 4:19\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm having trouble understanding how Rashi is reading Tehillim 36:3 in his commentary on Deut. 4:19. </p>\n\n<p>In Rashi's commentary on Deut. 4:19, he puts forward two possible interpretations of \"asher chalak Hashem\":   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>1) Hashem apportioned the heavenly host to all the nations in order to give them light.   </p></li>\n<li><p>2) Hashem apportioned the heavenly host to all the <strong>other</strong> nations as deities, in order that they be led astray and consequently driven from the world.   </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Rashi then brings down <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.36.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 36:3</a> as a kind of proof-text. But it seems to me that Rashi is interpreting the pasuk from Tehillim in a somewhat unusual way.   </p>\n\n<p>Rashi writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.19?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.4.19.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>אשר חלק ה'</strong></a>. לְהָאִיר לָהֶם (מגילה ט'); דָּ\"אַ לֶאֱלוֹהוֹת, לֹא מְנָעָן מִלִּטְעוֹת אַחֲרֵיהֶם אֶלָּא הֶחֱלִיקָם בְּדִבְרֵי הַבְלֵיהֶם לְטָרְדָם מִן הָעוֹלָם, וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר (תהלים ל\"ו) \"כִּי הֶחֱלִיק אֵלָיו בְּעֵינָיו לִמְצֹא עֲוֹנוֹ לִשְׂנֹא\" (עבודה זרה נ\"ה):</p>\n  \n  <p>To give light to them (to all peoples) (Megillah 9b). — Another explanation: which God assigned to them as deities; He did not prevent them from going astray after them, but He allowed them to err (to slip) through vain speculations, in order to drive them out from the world. Similarly it states, (Psalms 36:3) \"He (God) made him err (slip) through his eyes (i.e. through what his eyes behold) until his iniquity be found and he be hated” (Avodah Zarah 55a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding of this pasuk in the context of Tehillim 36 is that הֶחֱלִיק is referring to נְאֻם-פֶּשַׁע,the speech of transgression, which appears one pasuk earlier in the same psalm. In this way, I'm reading the pasuk as \"for it (נְאֻם-פֶּשַׁע) caused him (לָרָשָׁע) to err...\" but it seems like Rashi is reading הֶחֱלִיק as \"He (ie Hashem) caused him (לָרָשָׁע) to slip/err\". </p>\n\n<p>Am I correct in thinking that this is the way Rashi is interpreting Tehillim 36:3?   </p>\n\n<p>Thank you and kol tuv, everyone!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.36.3?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 36:3</a> seems to write the way you understand it (ie Hashem causes the <em>rasha</em> to slip/err):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כי החליק</strong>. הפשע על הרשע בחלקלקות בעיניו כדי שימצא הקב\"ה את עונו לשנוא אותו:</p>\n<p>Hashem has the wicked one sin through the smoothing over the transgression in [the <em>rasha's</em>] eyes in order that Hashem finds his sin to hate</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Edit: after reading Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.36.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 36:2</a>, It should be read like this:</p>\n\n<p>He (The sin, <em>Yetzer Hara</em>) made him (the evil man) think  that he is \"covered/smooth\", [but that's just] in his (of the evil man) eyes, [to make god] find his sin, and hate him (the evil man).</p>\n\n<p>IMHO:\nit could be read:</p>\n\n<p>He (הרשע) caused him[self] to smooth/cover [his own evil deeds]...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Hebrew allow for this conception of the pronunciation of the \"Tetragammaton\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I know no Hebrew.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to find out if <a href=\"https://www.119ministries.com/teachings/articles/why-gods-name-is-not-yehovah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Hebrew argument that this article makes concerning the pronunciation of the divine Name</a> is cogent or not. As an outsider they seem to know what they are talking about.</p>\n<p>Here's how the article beings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pronunciation of God’s four-letter name, יהוה, known as the Tetragrammaton (meaning “four letters”), is a controversial subject in some religious circles. That is because no one knows for sure how to pronounce it, and yet there are no shortage of confident assertions. This article will focus on why one confidently asserted pronunciation—that is, “Yehovah”—is incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of a Jewish scribal custom.</p>\n<p>First it’s important to understand that Hebrew was originally written without vowels. When biblical Hebrew was a spoken language, there wasn’t a need for written vowels since those who spoke the language could easily identify the vowel sounds as they read the Hebrew Scriptures. However, by the second half of the first millennium CE, a need for a study aid to preserve the pronunciation of biblical Hebrew had arisen.<a href=\"https://www.119ministries.com/teachings/articles/why-gods-name-is-not-yehovah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></p>\n<p>Out of this need, Jewish scribes known as the Masoretes developed the Tiberian vocalization—that is, a system of diacritical points used to represent vowels that are added to the consonantal text of the Hebrew Scriptures. This vocalization is represented in the Masoretic Text. While other systems of vocalization were experimented with, the Tiberian vocalization became the definitive Hebrew and Aramaic text for Judaism.[2] The Masoretic Text is also used to produce most of our English translations of the Old Testament.</p>\n<p>The oldest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Scriptures that uses the Tiberian vocalization is the Leningrad Codex, which is dated around 1008 CE. This Codex was corrected against the Aleppo Codex, which is older than the Leningrad by several decades. The Aleppo Codex used to be the oldest complete Hebrew manuscript of the Hebrew Scriptures, but sadly a significant portion of it has been lost to us today.[3]</p>\n<p>Where Did The “Yehovah” Pronunciation Come From?</p>\n<p>In the Aleppo and Leningrad codices, יהוה appears with a variety of different vowel markings. Most of the time it appears with only two vowels, whether that be sheva-qamets (יְהוָה) or sheva-chiriq (יְהוִה). Many other times it appears with three vowels, whether that is sheva-cholem-qamets (יְהֹוָה) or sheva-cholem-chiriq (יְהֹוִה). Other variations appear less frequently, such as chatef segol-cholem-chiriq (יֱהֹוִה), which occurs once,[4] and chatef segol-chiriq (יֱהוִה), which occurs twice.[5]</p>\n<p>Among these variations, some have insisted that when יהוה occurs with the three vowels, sheva-cholem-qamets (יְהֹוָה), that these instances give us the actual pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton. Indeed, it is argued that when the Masoretic scribes wrote יְהֹוָה, they were mistakenly revealing the true pronunciation as Yehovah (or Yehowah). This assertion, however, is incorrect. Those three vowels attached to יהוה were not meant to give us the pronunciation of the Sacred Name, but rather to alert the reader to say Adonai (אֲדֹנָי).</p>\n<p>When יְהֹוָה appears in the Masoretic text, the Masoretes were using a scribal custom known as ketiv-qere (Aramaic for “what is written/what is said”) by which they would insert the vowels of the word to be read aloud (qere) with the consonants of the written word (ketiv), creating a hybrid form. In the case of the Tetragrammaton, the vowels for the word Adonai were attached to the consonants, יהוה. The vowels were intended to remind the reader to say “Adonai” when they read יהוה. Semitic language scholar, Dr. Michael Brown, explains:</p>\n<p>\"The name Jehovah is actually based on a mistaken reading of the biblical text by medieval Christian scholars who were educated in the Hebrew language but were not aware of certain Jewish scribal customs. In short, they did not realize that it was a Jewish tradition to write the vowels for the word adonai, “Lord,” with the consonants for the name Yahweh, known as the Tetragrammaton, and they wrongly read this hybrid word as Yehowah, or Jehovah in English. That is to say, the name Jehovah (or Yehowah) did not exist in Israel—despite the popularity of this name in English-speaking Christian circles, and despite religious organizations like Jehovah’s Witnesses.[6]\"...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: If this is off topic please advise and I'll delete.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yes, they’re correct.</p>\n<p>First, some background information about Hebrew: Vowel symbols are not actually part of the language. Hebrew is something called an Abjad, which is an alphabet of only consonants, with the appropriate vowels being inferred by the reader. However, Hebrew vowel diacritics do exist. They were invented by the Masorites, who were the first to record in writing the pronunciation of the Hebrew Scriptures. (Nowadays, the vowel diacritics are used in Hebrew personal bibles as a pronunciation guide, and to teach children certain Hebrew words).</p>\n<p>I will now rephrase part of the article, adding some important details:</p>\n<p>The Masoretic text contains a phenomenon called <em>Ketiv</em> and <em>Qereh</em>. <em>Ketiv</em> is the visual, written word, and <em>Qere</em> is what is verbally pronounced.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, the two do not align; for example, a word may be spelled unusually, or spelled like a slightly different word. The various cases when this disparity occurs were transmitted by the Masorites to Jews today.<br />\nSome of these cases occur regularly on a certain word. For example, Issachar, one of the tribes, is spelled with two of the letter for the S-sound. However, only one is pronounced.<br />\nIn all cases—regular and unique—the Masorites in their codices would write the written word, but with the vowel diacritics of whatever was read.</p>\n<p>Another example is the Tetragrammaton. This Name is spelled with the Hebrew versions of the letters Y, H, W, and another H. The tetragrammation is never, unconditionally, EVER pronounced as written. (It will be in the future, but that’s another story.) It is only ever pronounced one of two ways: The Hebrew word for “God”, or a modified form of the word “my Master”.<br />\nThus, the Tetragrammaton is an example of regular <em>Ketiv</em> and <em>Qereh</em>. The Masorites, as usual, wrote the vocalization of the pronounced word, not of the written word.</p>\n<p>In the cases when the Tetragrammaton is pronounced as a modified form of “My Master”—as it almost always is—the vocalization marks the vowels Ĕ/Ă, Ō, and Ā respectively. These are the vowels of the pronounced Hebrew word, and thus marked these cases of the Tetragrammaton. The consonant letters, however, still reflected the <em>Ketiv</em> (written word), not the <em>qereh</em>.<br />\nAssuming otherwise is a mistake.</p>\n\n\n",

It is at a very nice hotel and everyone is expected to be there.</p>\n\n<p>My manager and I think 99% percent of my team are gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>I have already taken vacation for these days which have been approved by my manager but I'd like to notify my manager that I won't be attending the summit, explaining the significance of Rosh Hashanah, in a way that he would understand why I cannot attend the summit.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine other people have faced similar issues before. How would you recommend I go about saying I can't attend, explaining the significance of the holiday, and also explaining that I cannot do work on those days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>I have faced this problem several times - sometimes a holiday and sometimes Shabbat (directly, or not having time to get home). How I handle it depends in part on whether the plans can still be changed, but the broad outline is the same. It goes roughly like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Name), I'd really like to be able to attend this event. (Something about why it's important.) Unfortunately, it is currently scheduled on an important religious holiday and I cannot attend. I'd like to find a way to avoid scheduling conflicts in the future; how can we work together to do that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Key points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You want to fully participate; you value the activity. Sometimes people make excuses to get out of things they don't want to do; this is not that.</p></li>\n<li><p>It's a scheduling conflict, not an accusation. Don't say \"but you scheduled it on Rosh Hashana\"; that can sound like personal criticism.  This is a time for passive voice.</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Currently\": if you think it can still be changed, leave that opening and ask if changes are possible. </p></li>\n<li><p>You offer to be part of the solution.  We are a minority and even if they know about our holidays they might not know about two-day days or days starting the previous day (from their perspective). At one company I maintained a calendar and included some time info when especially important (like erev Yom Kippur). Expect the burden to fall on you for a while,  though they might learn in time. (After several years I changed a culture of Friday-evening gatherings at one place.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I usually don't try to explain specific holidays unless they ask. I do explain that it's very important to observe those days and that work on those days is a violation of religious law. That's been sufficient for me so far.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>I have faced this issue many times myself - or advised younger colleagues facing the same. A few thoughts</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have found it critical to be very clear, direct and consistent. If you can explain that you are a religious Jews, never work/use electricity/travel on Shabbat and religious holidays, and consistently take off all holidays, then most non-Jews will understand and respect it. The minute someone makes an exception, (s)he loses a lot of leverage</li>\n<li>It typically helps to share in advance a calendar of the upcoming year with your direct manager, or whoever approves absences (e.g., HR), laying out clearly all normal working days where you cannot work</li>\n<li><p>I have found that, when relevant, offering to work on non-Jewish holidays can be a wonderful way of showing you care about the team/organization - and can help gain much credit with colleagues</p></li>\n<li><p>many non-Jews don't have the same relations to their holidays, for them it is often a social event that can be skipped. They also have a different understanding of \"New Year\" than ours. As such it is important to avoid the parallel. Mentioning Rosh Hashana is the new year is typically <strong>not</strong> helpful</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Good luck !</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><strong>myjewishlearning.com</strong> has an article titled \"<a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ask-the-expert-how-do-i-ask-for-the-high-holidays-off/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How Do I Ask for the High Holidays Off</a>?\" which addresses how to handle this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, provide straightforward information.

If you’re asking if you can have the days off and not to have them count as vacation days, think about creative ways you can get your work done early, and other times you may be able to make up your hours.

    "content": "# The science behind making liver kosher\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems that salting and soaking liver is insufficient to release the blood sufficiently to make it kosher. It needs to be broiled (or is there some other method that also works?)</p>\n\n<p>What's the science behind this? I would think that the heart which is the main blood-pumping organ, would also need to be broiled, but, I guess not. What's special about the liver? Is it the same with all kosher animals and birds?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The halachic issue behind broiling liver is the prohibition to eat blood (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.17.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 17:10</a>). \"Since the liver contains much blood, it therefore not permissible to cook it even after salting it\" (quote from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.73.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 73:1</a>, see also <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/31516\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Maybe less well known is the fact that <strong>the heart also cannot be eaten after only being salted and cooked</strong>. Blood first needs to be removed from the heart by tearing it open, washing and salting it. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=4474\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HalachaYomit</a> brings the following</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Heart is sold in stores without being koshered first and there is\n  still blood in it and it may therefore not be consumed until it\n  undergoes a halachically valid koshering process.</strong> The reason why heart\n  is not salted before it is sold is because when the animal or bird is\n  slaughtered, <strong>a large amount of blood is collected in the heart and it\n  is like a container for this blood and it cannot be expelled through\n  salting alone</strong>. Thus, even if they would salt the heart, this would not\n  be sufficient to release the blood contained in it and consumption of\n  the heart would still be absolutely forbidden.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Before the heart is salted, it must be torn open and the blood inside\n  it must be washed off with water and only then may it be salted.</strong>\n  Tearing the heart refers to cutting it at least once deep enough that\n  it reaches all of the corridors of the heart along either its entire\n  length or width. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>After doing so, one should salt the heart well by covering it with\n  fine cooking salt on all sides and leave it in this matter for\n  approximately an hour on top of a rack or other perforated utensil so\n  that all the blood can drip out of it.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>If one does not wish to salt the heart (or any other piece of meat for\n  that matter), one may kosher it by grilling it</strong> (preferably, one should\n  place a small amount of salt on the meat and only then grill it) since\n  grilling also causes the blood to flow out of it and it will then be\n  permissible for consumption. Even when wishes to kosher the heart by\n  grilling it, one must tear it properly as we have explained above\n  regarding salting the heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it is really the presence of blood in blood-rich organs, such as the liver and the heart, which is the root issue.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a key difference between the liver and the heart. One can take blood out of the heart by tearing, rinsing, salting then cooking it (see <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-72/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). For the liver, one needs to tear or slice, rinse then broil/gril it (see <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-73/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/1133/kashering-liver/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I imagine the difference is that blood gets more absorbed into the liver than the heart. @JoshK in comments speculates it is because of the density of the liver. But I don't feel qualified to comment on the science of it (and am not sure it belongs on this site).</p>\n\n\n",

It's scriptural. Something special about these four kinds of situation that gets them singled out in Tehillim.</p>\n<p>Leaving simple understandings... I would suggest what that \"something special\" is If we look at context in Tehillim 107, we get (v. 2-3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יֹ֭אמְרוּ גְּאוּלֵ֣י ה֑' אֲשֶׁ֥ר גְּ֝אָלָ֗ם מִיַּד־צָֽר׃ וּֽמֵאֲרָצ֗וֹת קִ֫בְּצָ֥ם מִמִּזְרָ֥ח וּמִֽמַּעֲרָ֑ב מִצָּפ֥וֹן וּמִיָּֽם׃</p>\n<p>The redeemed (<em>ge'ulei</em>) of Hashem will say -- those He redeemed (<em>ga'al</em>) from adversity -- / whom He gathered in from the lands, from east and west, from the north and from the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>People in these four situations not only were saved, but they were saved in situations that provide <em>ge'ulah</em> redemption.</p>\n<p>The Gra (quoted in Seder haArukh) also hears echoes of the redemption from Egypt in the chapter as a whole. Although not verse 3 (above) which speaks of an in-gathering from all four compass points. But 106 was about the Exodus from Egypt, and v. 1's \"הֹד֣וּ לַה֣' כִּי־ט֑וֹב כִּ֖י לְעוֹלָ֣ם חַסְדּֽוֹ׃ -- Thank Hashem for He is Good, for His Lovingkingness is Eternal\" is a recap of the opening of ch. 105, which runs through the forefathers until getting Israel (including the Exodus from Egypt), and ch. 106, which is about the Exodus.</p>\n<p>More tellingly, and what the Gra discusses at more length -- these four situations in particular were involved. (a) Crossing Yam Suf, then (b) the desert, (c) we were healed at Har Sinai and (d) freed from Egyptian bondage.</p>\n<p>So it seems to me we hold that these four situations, which ought to bring to mind our Exodus from Egypt and the eventual ultimate redemption, require <em>birkhas hagomel</em>. Not because they are particularly risky, but because we should be taking our situation as a source of hope for global redemption.</p>\n<p>And then we hold, not from this gemara or Tehillim 107 altogether, that a miraculous salvation from risky situations also require a <em>Birkhas haGomel</em>. Although some say that an abridged version, without the critical elements of including G-d's name or Kingship [<em>sheim umalkhus</em>] should be said. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.219.9-10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Arukh Orakh Chaim 219:9-10</a>.

The Arukh haShulchan also makes a point of including \"hidden miracles\" in this obligation, not only the explicitly nature violating kind (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.219.3-4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid, se'ifim 3-4</a>).</p>\n<p>Side note: The Rosh (Rosh, Brachos 9:3) and his son the Tur (OC 219) understand Rav Yehudah quoting Rav as talking about when one should be bringing a <em>Qorban Todah</em> (Thanksgiving Offering). His words are \"צריכין להודות -- must thank.\" It is \"only\" when we get to the ammora'im (including Rav Yehudah himself, not citing Rav) that this turns into a discussion of berakhos. <em>Birkhas haGomel</em> is a replacement for the <em>Todah</em>, so the gemara just discusses their common rules without explicitly distinguishing between the two.</p>\n\n\n",

It is not clear (at least to me) who the author of this work would have been. I would like to know what the status of this book would be, and why, should it be recovered. Would it be included in Tanakh (the biblical canon) and have a status similar to Divrei HaYamim, would it be treated as any other document from the ancient world, having no special status, or perhaps somewhere in between?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a very good question. I have tried searching for sources several times on this topic without much luck, but today I found a few sources that may assist in answering this question. Perhaps the general lack is because we know so little about this book and other books mentioned explicitly or hinted at in Tanach (such as Sefer Hayashar, 3000 parables of Shlomo, Divrei Shlomo<sup>1</sup> and so forth) that it is difficult to draw any conclusions about these books. More sources that discuss these books are ambiguous about their halachic status. Tentatively I'll write down that from what I've seen, should these books be found B\"H, their status would likely be somewhere in-between: Holy but not canon. Let me explain:</p>\n<p>It's a mystery when exactly each of these books was lost, although I personally believe that no book mentioned in Tanach was still around by the late-Persian-early-Hellenistic periods, being that Ben Sira, which was likely written circa that time, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ben_Sira.44.1-49.16?vhe=Ben_Sira,_David_Kahana_ed._--_Wikisource_&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentions</a> many of the leaders of Am Yisrael from Tanach but makes no mention of any person that does not appear our Tanach (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ben_Sira.50.1-24?vhe=Ben_Sira,_David_Kahana_ed._--_Wikisource_&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">save for</a> the Kohen Gadol of his time, Shimon ben Yochanan, who may or may not have been Shimon Hatzaddik).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to my knowledge, Josephus, centuries later, also doesn't mention any people who might have appeared in such books, nor does he state that the canon, in his opinion, included more books. Some rabbis thought that in the case of at least some of the books, copies only existed in the Kingdom of Yisrael, and when the Ten Tribes were exiled, their books were lost as well. For example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ahron Marcus</a> wrote in Barzilai, pg. 275 (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...this word, as well as the phrase \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Proverbs.30.31?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">זרזיר מתנים</a>\", whose meaning is unknown, were most likely copied from sources that were brought from the destroyed Samaria, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Proverbs.25.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 25:1</a>: \"These too are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied\"...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such an interpretation of the verse is hinted at in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tanna_debei_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Additions_to_Seder_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Mavo.8?vhe=Tanna_deBei_Eliyahu_Zuta&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanna Devei Eliyahu Zuta, additions to Seder Eliyahu Zuta, Introduction 8</a>.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Pseudo-Rashi on Divrei Hayamim 1:7:13 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.7.13?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_I_Chronicles.7.13.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, etc. And why was no more of his genealogy traced? This is the reason, as explained at the end of Megillah Yerushalmi: Ezra found three books, and each one of them contained part of the genealogy; that which he found he did not write, and of the sons of Naphtali he did not find any more. For this reason, the entire genealogy is traced with omissions, because he skipped from one book to another and combined them. And that which he could not write in this Book, he wrote in the Book of Ezra. You should know [that this is true] because it is written close by (9:1): “And all Israel traced their genealogy, and behold they are written in the book of the kings of Israel, and Judah was exiled to Babylon because of its treachery.” The meaning is that if you wish to know the genealogy of the Ten Tribes, go to Halah and Habor, the Gozan River, and the cities of Media, because their annals were exiled with them, but as for Judah I found their records in Babylon, and that which I found, I wrote.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and so forth. Per sources such as these, it seems that these books were never outright rejected by Chazal as not being holy. It should be noted that within Chazalic sources, some traditions about these books <em>may</em> have been preserved. For example, Heschel opined that the phrase sung by Bnei Yisrael in the desert per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.24b.17?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 24b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.54.4?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 54:4</a> was from the Book of Eldad and Medad (see a summary of his view <a href=\"https://leimanlibrary.com/texts_of_publications/15.%20The%20Inverted%20Nuns.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>); <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.14a.11?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Megillah.14a.11.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Megillah 14a</a> thought that the words of the unnamed prophet in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.25.15-16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:25:15-16</a> were those of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.10b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amotz</a> (and see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.15a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), hence - likely that Amotz had his own prophetic work; and so forth.</p>\n<p>Prophetic works not included in Tanach are, of course, holy - they are no less the words of Hashem than those that were included in the Tanach. The difficulty comes with regards to books that don't have names that sound like prophetic books - as is the case with the Book of the Wars of Hashem.</p>\n<p>Today I found <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.17.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Exodus.17.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni on Shemot 17:14</a> who opined that the book mentioned in the verse is this same book, and that it was lost due to our sins. This is pretty similar to what several other commentators wrote, but interestingly, one of the other books the he mentions is Midrash Ido, which was a prophetic work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.13.22?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentioned</a> in Divrei Hayamim. He seems to equate these two in terms of status.</p>\n<p>Based on this, I'd conclude that the status of the book is that of a lost prophetic work<sup>2</sup>, or at the very least, written in Ruach Hakodesh.</p>\n<p>But were it to (hopefully!) be found, it would probably not be included in Tanach, as Rabbi Yehudah Hachassid wrote in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14561&pgnum=206\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chassidim, siman 1016</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...and that which is written \"are recorded in the story of the prophet Iddo\" the Men of the Great Assembly have already said what was needed to be recorded and no prophet is allowed to add anything to the twenty-four books, not an angel or Eliyahu...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe the reason for this is as the Talmud famously states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.14a.11?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 14a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"However, only a portion of the prophecies were recorded, because only prophecy that was needed for future generations was written down in the Bible for posterity, but that which was not needed, as it was not pertinent to later generations, was not written.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is typically thought by many to mean that only these twenty-four books were written down, but we know that's not true - many other books were also written down. Rather, I think the Talmud meant that prophecies that were necessary for eternity were <em>preserved</em> and those that weren't - weren't as well cared for, and were thus lost.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Although I know someone who hypothesized in his MA thesis that most of that particular book was copied as-is and inserted in the Book of Kings. One of the appendices of the thesis featured the theoretical recreation of the book. The notion is fascinating, although I'm sure there are those out there who would disagree.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> It's no less a prophetic work if it was written by someone other than the prophet who prophesied the words in the book. Consider Baruch writing down Yirmiyahu's prophecies and the list of people said to have written down or completed the books of past prophets (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.14b.12-15a.9?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 14b-15a</a>).</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90_(%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A8)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel Shrirah</a> in his book Mevo Lekitvei Hakodesh, pg. 50, points out that if a canon of books had not been set, then most likely <em>none</em> of the books would have been preserved, considering everything that happened to Am Yisrael during the diaspora. Since a canon had been set, we Jews took great pains to preserve it. We should therefore be thankful for what we do have.</p>\n\n\n",

Said Rabbah: How well this student knows how to placate his Master! Said Abaye to him: But we have learnt, HE IS SILENCED? — Rabbah too acted thus only to test  Abaye.</p>\n  \n  <p>A certain [reader] went down in the presence of R. Hanina and said, O God, the great, mighty, terrible, majestic, powerful, awful, strong, fearless, sure and honoured. He waited till he had finished, and when he had finished he said to him, Have you concluded all the praise of your Master? Why do we want all this? Even with these three that we do say,  had not Moses our Master mentioned them in the Law  and had not the Men of the Great Synagogue come and inserted them in the Tefillah, we should not have been able to mention them, and you say all these and still go on! It is as if an earthly king had a million denarii of gold, and someone praised him as possessing silver ones. Would it not be an insult to him?</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_33.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the first incident someone violated one of the rules mentioned in the Mishnah for which we silence people. Yet it does not say that Rabbah, or Abbaye, interrupted the person or threw him down. It appear that they merely raised the issue afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>In the second incident we are introduced to another problematic form of prayer – using too many adjectives to describe God's greatness. In this case, too, we do not find that R. Chanina interrupted the person. In fact the Talmud explicitly states <em>He waited till he had finished</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In his commentary there, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharsha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Samuel Eidels</a> point this out and suggests that that is in fact what the Mishnah meant by \"we silence him\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הא דלא היו משתקין אותו בתפלתו לא רבה ולא אביי י\"ל דלאחר תפלתו קאמר דמשתקין אותו שלא יעשה כן פעם אחרת וכן לקמן גבי המרבה בשבחות קאמר המתין לו עד דסיים כו</p>\n  \n  <p>As for this that neither Rabbah nor Abbaye silenced him during his prayer, one could say that [the Mishnah] meant that after his prayer we silence him so that he won't do it again. And similarly, later on by the one who was excessive with praises it says that he waited for him until he finished, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ezekiel Landau</a> in his commentary <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37718&st=&pgnum=63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> interprets \"silence him\" literally:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לשון הרמב\"ם בפירוש המשנה ענין מה שאמרו על קן צפור וכו' שיאמר כמו שחמלת על קן צפור וכו' כן רחם עלינו וכן פירש הברטנורא וכבר ראיתי מי שתמה הלא סיום דבר זה לא נזכר במשנה אבל טעות הוא בידם שהתנא קמ\"ל שאין מניחין אותו לסיים דבריו ומשתקין אותו תיכף בתחלת דבריו</p>\n  \n  <p>The wording of the Rambam in the Commentary to the Mishnah is <em>the matter of that which they said \"on the bird's nest etc.\" that someone says \"just like you had mercy on the bird's nest etc. so too have mercy on us.</em> And the Bartenura explains likewise. And I have already seen people who wondered \"this ending is not mentioned in the Mishnah!\" But it is a mistake in their hands, because the tanna is teaching us that we don't leave him to finish his words; we silence him immediately at the beginning of his words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A Gaonic interpretation (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38274&st=&pgnum=199\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar Hagaonim, Berachot, HaPeirushim p. 46</a>) refers to it as removing the person with scolding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד דאמ' כזה מסלקין אותו בנזיפה      </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Schick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses Shick</a> in a responsum (O.C. 31) cites the questioner as saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וגם מה שאמרו בברכות [ל\"ג ע\"ב] דשמע שמע כגון דאמר מילתא מילתא ותני לה מגונה הוי ואף דאין משתקין אותו בשעת מעשה מכל מקום צריך למחות בו שלא יעשה כן בפעם אחרת כיון דהוי מגונה</p>\n  \n  <p>And also that which they said in Berachot (33b) that \"shema shema\" in the form of saying it word by word, they taught about it that it is deplorable, and even though we don't silence him at the moment we nevertheless must protest it so that he doesn't do it again, since it is deplorable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then acknowledges that the questioner is correct:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונכונים כל דבריו</p>\n  \n  <p>And all his words are correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If for things which the Talmud does not rule to \"silence him\" we don't silence him in the moment but instead rebuke him later, the implication is that when the Talmud does rule to \"silence him\" we silence him on the spot.</p>\n\n\n",

Yet, even so, they would make use of a lesser voice (of prophesy).  Therefore, there no longer is prophesy, but the prophets continue to speak to us today. Aside from the diminished form of prophesy, it appears there are at least four types of prophesy itself.\nThe first is the prophesy of Moshe Rabbeinu, distinct from all of the other prophesies.  The Gemara [Yevamos 49b] states, “All of the prophets envisioned through an unlit telescope (aspaklaria). Moshe Rabbeinu envisioned through a luminous telescope. This is one of the thirteen principles of faith [see, Rambam, Introduction to Chelek, where he makes four distinctions].\nThe second type is development of deep insight in understanding the ways of HaShem through intense Torah study, to the point that one can anticipate what others cannot. In this respect, the Gemara [Bava Basra 12a] relates, Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa stated, “From the day that the Beis HaMikdash was destroyed, prophecy was removed from the prophets and given to the Chachamim (Sages).” The Gemara asks, isn’t a Chacham a prophet?  It then explains, “Although it was removed from the prophets, it was not removed from the Chachamim” apparently referring to this profound insight. In this sense, Rambam [Moreh Nevuchim 3:32] states HaShem selects only the best and wisest persons, and that prophesy is only possible with training.\nThe third type of prophesy appears to be a spontaneous vision or statement. In this respect, the Gemara [12b] continues, Rabbi Yochanan stated, “From the day that the Beis HaMikdash was destroyed, prophecy was removed from the prophets and given to incompetents and children. Due to the lack of sufficient capacity to realize the import of their words, at times, incompetents and children may innocently state something significant, suggesting future events. [See, Sota 12b as an example].  Additionally, one who is less preoccupied with life’s challenges, together with a desire to control, may have better reception (not perception) for spiritual messages. For this reason, dreams are also better conduits for reception.  Accordingly, a dream is one sixtieth of prophesy [Berachos 57b] and when one awakes with a pasuk falling into his mouth, it is minor prophesy [id., 55b]. \nThe second and third types are clearly distinct, not only because of their respective character, but because the Gemara does not present the views of Rabbi Avdimi and Rabbi Yochanan as being opposed to each other, as it would if there were a dispute. Further, each type is validated elsewhere throughout the Gemara.  For example, since the third type of prophesy exists post Beis HaMikdash, the Gemara informs us that we may ask children to recite a recently studied verse, which might provide guidance.  Rabbi Meir employed this method in attempting to show Elisha ben Avuya he will be accepted if he repents [Chagiga 15a-b]. Nero employed this method in deciding not to lead the invasion of Yerushalayim [Gittin 56a]. This is not bibliomancy, as the previous answer opined. The Gemara [Chulin 95b] makes this distinction, as follows: Shmuel employed the method of looking into a sefer, whereas Rabbi Yochanan asked children.\nTo answer your question, there is nothing prohibiting asking a child what he learned today, although the method of teaching has changed and children do not typically memorize pasukim.\nThe fourth type of prophesy is the familiar language of the Tanach. This appears to be a combination of the second and third types.  That is, clarity of message and purpose, combined with spontaneity and personal detachment. In this sense, Rambam [Yesodei HaTorah 7:1] explains prophesy as follows: “At the time the Spirit rests on him, his being joins the level of malachim, called Ishim, and he becomes a different person. And he will understand, he is not as he was, but he has ascended over the level of other intelligent people.” When this prophet speaks, his message and manner are unique.  After all, each person’s mind develops differently, so it is not possible for two prophets to convey their messages in the same style. If they do so, the message is suspect of not being true [Sanhedrin 89a].\nThe Mechilta [Chapter 6], appears to refer to the fourth type, when it writes, “At the time HaKadosh Baruch Hu appeared to the Forefathers, to speak to them, He did not appear through lightning, nor thunder, nor noises, nor terrors, because they knew His power and His might and His greatness and His ability. However, with the other prophets, HaKadosh Baruch Hu would rise over them with noises, thunder, lightning and flames according to the need of their generation.  Due to what?  Due to the requirements of the people of their generation, who did not know the powerful greatness of HaKadosh Baruch Hu. If only though noises and lightning (they would understand) and if only they would humble themselves.”\nThe prophets of the Tanach continue to speak to us and their prophesies continue to unfold. For example, Yishaiah (26:20-21) states, “Go, my people, come into your room and close your door, for your sake. Hide for nearly a moment, until the wrath passes. For behold, HaShem will leave His place to hold accountable for crime, residents of earth, upon each one. And the earth will reveal its bloodshed and no longer cover up its murders.” The Gemara [Bava Kamma 60b] identifies, “wrath” in this context as referring to a plague or pandemic. If only though confinement would we reflect with humility, noting that devastation is occurring in places where the blood of Jews had flowed freely without protest.  Thus, prophesy is alive today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is called bibliomancy: chancing upon a verse in the Torah and interpreting it as a suggestion for a course of action.  It is allowed because of the special status of the Torah in our lives. What better way to make it unplanned than asking a random child what verse he is learning?</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam said: “If one asks a child, ‘What verse are you learning?’ and he responds with a verse from the blessings, it is permitted for one to rejoice and say, ‘That is a lucky sign’” (Idolatry 11:5).  This from someone who constantly railed against superstition, irrationality, astrology, and the like.  </p>\n\n\n",

The former type of store is dedicated to bread and there are fewer kosher-ingredients concerns compared to the latter, which also makes cakes and pastries.)</p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, the logic of <em>pat paltar</em> (given the perceived need for bread as a dietary staple Talmudically, the high costs of baking equipment, and the negligible likelihood of blurred social lines from a commercial relationship rather than a personal one) should apply whether the sign on the door says <em>BOB'S BAKERY</em> or <em>BOB'S RESTAURANT & BAKERY.</em> However, a <em>lot</em> more things could go wrong kosher-ingredients-wise in the latter case, unless you know a lot of very detailed information about their kitchen.</p>\n<p>If you're asking about what grain products are covered by the halachic dispensation of <em>pat paltar</em> (assuming the ingredients check out) -- okay it works for bread, what about cake, doughnuts, pancakes, pasta ... suggest you ask that as a more-specific question.</p>\n\n\n",

This is that which the verse stated (Lamentations 3:38), \"Is it not at the word of the Most High, that weal and woe befall?\" At the time that Israel stood in front of Mount Sinai, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them the Torah. At that time, the Holy One, blessed be He, took remuneration from every [individual] that sinned. In the past the generation would pay for the sin of anyone who sinned. Our rabbis said about the generation of the Flood, \"There were many among them that were proper as much as Noach, and they were erased with the generation.\" In the generation of [the Tower of Babel], when they sinned, the infants were charged. [But] from when Israel stood at Sinai and the Holy One, blessed be He gave them the commandments, He said, \"In the past, the generations were punished for each of their [individuals]. [But] from now on, a generation will not be punished for an [individual].\" Hence, \"Is it not at the word of the Most High, that weal and woe befall?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See Yad, Teshuvah 5:2</p>\n\n\n",

The greats of\n  that generation acted thusly by saying that it would be like\n  mourning publicly on Shabbos. </p>\n  \n  <p>ולכן אפילו בשבת שחל בו תשעה באב ונדחה – אנו לובשין בגדי שבת מטעם זה.\n  ולכן בימינו אלה, כמעט נשכח הדבר שאין ללבוש בגדי שבת בשבת חזון.ותמוה\n  אצלי דבר זה, דאטו קדמונינו לא ידעו זה? ועם כל זה נהגו בזה, אף שאינו כן\n  מדינא; ואיך נבטל מנהגם?</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, it is for this very reason that even when when Tisha Baav\n  falls on Shabbos, we still wear regular Shabbos clothes like normal.\n  It therefore seems that this practice of refraining from wearing\n  Shabbos clothes on Shabbos Chazon has been very much forgotten these\n  days. I personally find this perplexing. Did the ones who originally\n  instituted this [practice which Rama is quoting from] not know this?\n  Of course they did, and nonetheless acted this way regardless of the\n  slight pushing of the law’s boundaries. How, then, can we push away\n  their practices?</p>\n  \n  <p>ולכן נראה לעניות דעתי דזה תלוי באופן ההלבשה. דאצל הקדמונים היתה הלבשת\n  שבת וחול שווים בדמותם ובתמונתם, אלא שההפרש היה בין סחורה יקרה ובין\n  סחורה פשוטה, ולא היה ההפרש ניכר כל כך, שהרי עניים גם בשבת יוצאין\n  בסחורה פשוטה.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, it is my humble opinion that this entire discussion\n  revolves around the difference of manner in dressing. The earlier\n  generations’ garments were indistinguishable in there appearance\n  between Shabbos and weekday. It was only a difference in quality; some\n  expensive and some simple. The difference, however, was barely\n  intelligible. The poor would even regularly wear the simple-ware on\n  Shabbos!</p>\n  \n  <p>ולכן הנהיגו ללבוש בגדי חול.מה שאין כן זה כמה דורות מקודם, שבשבת היתה\n  תמונה אחרת לגמרי להבגדים, בין עני בין עשיר. כמו שבחול היו נושאין כובע\n  של קלאפי\"ן, ובשבת שטריימי\"ל. וכן שארי בגדים – היה ניכר לכל שזה בגד\n  חול, כמו קיטאי\"י, וזה בגד שבת, כמו של משי לעשיר, ומשי פשוט לעני.\n  ולפיכך הנהיגו הגדולים שלא לנהוג מנהג זה, מפני שההפרש ניכר הרבה, והוי\n  כאבילות בשבת.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, they were able to wear weekday clothes on Shabbos. This was not the case only a few generations ago. Shabbos clothing had an entirely different look to them regardless of quality and cost. For example, during the week they would wear a kalpin hat, and on Shabbos a shtreimel hat.  Weekday garments like kitai, could be easily distinguished between the silk Shabbos garments which both the poor and rich man would wear. This is precisely why they ended this practice, because the difference was now so great that it would be as if they were mourning on Shabbos. </p>\n  \n  <p>ולכן אני אומר דבזמנינו זה, שעל פי פקודת המלכות כבר החלפנו תמונת\n  הבגדים, ושבת וחול תמונה אחת להן, אלא שההפרש בין זול ליוקר – וודאי נכון\n  לקיים מנהג הקדמונים.(כן נראה לעניות דעתי. ודע דזה שנתבאר בסעיף ט דבכל\n  חדש אב לישתמט אינש וכו', מבואר בזוהר יתרו דף עח ב דרק עד תשעה באב\n  לישתמיט ולא יותר, עיין שם.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, I must end by saying that in our country the standards have been reset through governmental intervention, and our garments are once again indistinguishable. The only differing factor is the price and quality. In my humble opinion, it seems that we should reinstate this practice of yesteryear. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Should religious Jews look forward to the resumption of animal sacrifices?",
    "content": "# Should religious Jews look forward to the resumption of animal sacrifices?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to integrate all the facts and thoughts listed below to answer the following question:</p>\n\n<p>Should I hope for the resumption of animal sacrifices?</p>\n\n<p>1-Prayers for rebuilding the Temple and resuming sacrifices are in our liturgy.  For example, Amidah blessing 17 [Avodah] says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Restore the service to the Holy of Holies of your Temple.  Accept the fire offerings and the prayer of Israel with love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ishei Yisrael -- the fires of Israel -- refers to sacrifices, but the Talmud also uses that expression to refer to 'the righteous of Israel' [Menachot 110a]. Rabbi Soloveitchik believed it refers to our martyrs, the human “self-sacrifices” we have been forced to make in history, l’kiddush HaShem.</p>\n\n<p>2-Many prophets told us again and again: It's not your sacrifices God wants. But they did not try to abolish them.</p>\n\n<p>3-The Rambam taught that sacrifices were not meant to last indefinitely:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The custom in those days among all men…consisted in sacrificing animals.  God did not command us to give up these services; for this would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used.\n  Sacrifices [however] are not the primary object [of the commandments about sacrifice], prayers are.  [To wit,] we were not commanded to sacrifice in every place, and in every time, or to build a Temple in every place, or to allow anybody to become a priest and sacrifice.  Only one Temple has been appointed, and only] \"in the place which the Lord shall choose\" (Deut. 12:26).  In no other place are we allowed to sacrifice: \"Be careful not to give your burnt-offerings in every place that you see\" (Deut. 12:13); and only the members of a particular family were allowed to officiate as priests. All these restrictions served to limit this kind of worship.  But prayer and supplication can be offered everywhere and by every person. Because of this, the Prophets rebuke people for being over-zealous in bringing sacrifices.    [Moreh Nevuchim (Guide for the Perplexed), 3:32]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>4-But in his halachic writings, the Rambam upholds the traditional vision of the future:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Messiah... will build the Holy Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel...  All the laws of the Torah will be reinstated as before; the sacrifices will be offered, the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee instituted as outlined in the Torah. [Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11-12]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>5-The Ramban disagreed and taught that sacrifices had intrinsic value.</p>\n\n<p>6- Israeli rabbis and the secular government are united in banning Jewish visits to Temple Mount.  At the gate, you see the sign:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Entrance to the area of the Temple Mount is forbidden to everyone by Jewish Law owing to the sacredness of the place. Signed: The Chief Rabbinate of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why?  Because rabbis have declared all Jews to be in a state of ritual impurity (tamei), so they must not come close to the Holy of Holies, which is in that area but we don't know exactly where.  The rabbis also declared: No exploration, excavation, or prayer on Temple Mount. Jews are even forbidden to fly over it.  The ban will stay in effect until Messiah comes.</p>\n\n<p>Only a para adumah (red heifer) can remove our state of impurity.  We haven't had one for 2,000 years, and all candidates have been rejected by the rabbis (the last I know of was in 2002).  The Rambam says that the tenth and last will be prepared by the Messiah [Yad, Parah Adumah 3:4]  Some cynics have argued that the rarity of red heifers and the presence of the Islamic Mosque on Temple Mount gives Jews an excuse not to rebuild the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>7-The Midrash says: In the messianic age, all sacrifices will be discontinued, except for the thanksgiving offering. [Vayikra Rabbah 9:7]</p>\n\n<p>8-Studying the Torah without sacrificing animals may be enough.  In the Talmud, God says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whenever people read the order of the sacrifices in the\n  Torah, I will deem it as if they had offered them before me, and I will grant them pardon for all their iniquities. [Taanit 27b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Midrash, God tells Ezekiel: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Learning in the Torah about the description of My House is as great as building it.  Go and tell the Jewish people to occupy themselves in learning about the Temple, and in that merit I will consider it as if they are actually involved in building it. [Midrash Tanchuma, Tzav 14; Yalkut Shemoni on Ezekiel 43:10-11 (382).]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>9-Two thoughts from me: (1) Even though I am not a vegetarian, it makes sense that, if you are going to eat meat, you should see with your own eyes exactly where the meat comes from.  (2) Rebuilding the Temple and offering animal sacrifices are separate issues: The rebuilt Temple could be a splendid super-yeshiva and super-synagogue, but not a site for animal sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question: To help me reach a conclusion, do you know of any relevant facts, sources or expert opinions not covered above?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Your question brings me to tears, and I know you are not the only one who has questions about the future reinstatement of the korbanos. You have asked the question very honestly and in an even-handed way. Let me address some of your points.</p>\n\n<p>2) In Shmuel (I 15:22) for example, the prophet says to King Shaul:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר שְׁמוּאֵ֗ל הַחֵ֤פֶץ לַֽיהוָה֙ בְּעֹל֣וֹת וּזְבָחִ֔ים כִּשְׁמֹ֖עַ בְּק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה הִנֵּ֤ה שְׁמֹ֙עַ֙ מִזֶּ֣בַח ט֔וֹב לְהַקְשִׁ֖יב מֵחֵ֥לֶב אֵילִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And Shemuel said, Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is to say, sacrifices are good, but it is better to listen to the commandments that to go out of your way to bring better sacrifices. This, I believe, is the thrust of all the places that the prophets speak against bringing sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>3) Reb Yaakov Kaminetzki's explanation of the Rambam is brought <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37433/19563\">here</a>. \nIn short, we don't know the reasons for many mitzvos, for example all of the sacrifices, and the Rambam was giving one possible rationale, <strong>not</strong> the only reason. So sacrifices will be reinstated for their other, hidden reasons.</p>\n\n<p>6) The Rabbinate tells people not to go to the Temple Mount because an impure visitor is the worst of all sins (Tosefta Shvuos 1:2).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה ר\"ש אומר קשה טומאת מקדש וקדשיו מכל עבירות שבתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If, however, one were going to bring sacrifices, that can be done by a kohen who is impure if there is no one who is pure (pesachim 77a).</p>\n\n<p>(The secular government is against sacrifices because the temple is the antithesis of modern liberal values. This is not the right place to elaborate.)</p>\n\n<p>7) The medrash there (Vayikra rabah 9:7) says more fully: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי פִּנְחָס וְרַבִּי לֵוִי וְרַבִּי יוֹחָנָן בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי מְנַחֵם דְּגַלְיָא, לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא כָּל הַקָּרְבָּנוֹת בְּטֵלִין וְקָרְבַּן תּוֹדָה אֵינוֹ בָּטֵל, כָּל הַתְּפִלּוֹת בְּטֵלוֹת, הַהוֹדָאָה אֵינָהּ בְּטֵלָה</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Pinchas, Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yochanan [said] in the name of Rabbi Menachem from Gallia: In the time to come, all sacrifices will be annulled - but the sacrifice of thanksgiving will not be annulled.  All prayers will be annulled, but the prayer of gratitude will not be annulled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as we understand that prayer will not be annulled, sacrifices will not be annulled. The medrash means that they will be insignificant compared to thanksgiving. (This is the common usage of ביטול, overwhelmed by the majority.)</p>\n\n<p>8) The Mishna in Avos (1:17) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שִׁמְעוֹן בְּנוֹ אוֹמֵר... וְלֹא הַמִּדְרָשׁ הוּא הָעִקָּר, אֶלָּא הַמַּעֲשֶׂה. </p>\n  \n  <p>Shimon, his son, used to say:... Study is not the most important thing, but actions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In some way the recitation of the commandment of the sacrifices is a substitute for the actual offering, but it can not possibly be a replacement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Our prayers are full of yearning to once again be able to joyfully ascend Temple Mount and continue the Temple Sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbos Mussaf:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תכנת שבת <strong>רצית קרבנותיה</strong> צוית פרושיה עם סדורי נסכיה. מענגיה לעולם כבוד ינחלו טועמיה חיים זכו וגם האוהבים דבריה גדלה בחרו אז מסיני נצטוו עליה <strong>ותצונו ה' אלהינו להקריב בה קרבן מוסף שבת כראוי</strong>. יהי רצון מלפניך ה' אלהינו ואלהי אבותינו <strong>שתעלנו בשמחה לארצנו ותטענו בגבולנו ושם נעשה לפניך את קרבנות חובותינו תמידים כסדרם ומוספים כהלכתם ואת מוסף יום השבת הזה נעשה ונקריב לפניך באהבה כמצות רצונך</strong> כמו שכתבת עלינו בתורתך על ידי משה עבדך מפי כבודך כאמור\n  - <em>מוסף שבת</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yom Tov Mussaf:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבינו מלכנו גלה כבוד מלכותך עלינו מהרה והופע והנשא עלינו לעיני כל\n  חי. וקרב פזורינו מבין הגוים ונפוצותינו כנס מירכתי ארץ והביאנו לציון\n  עירך ברנה ולירושלים בית מקדשך בשמחת עולם <strong>ושם נעשה לפניך את קרבנות\n  חובותינו תמידים כסדרם ומוספים כהלכתם</strong>, ואת מוסף יום חג הזה, <strong>נעשה ונקריב לפניך באהבה כמצות רצונך</strong>. כמו שכתבת עלינו בתורתך על ידי משה עבדך\n  - <em>מוסף שלש רגלים</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amidah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רצה ה' אלהינו בעמך ישראל ובתפלתם <strong>והשב את העבודה לדביר ביתך</strong>. ו<strong>אשי ישראל</strong>\n  ותפלתם <strong>באהבה תקבל ברצון</strong>. ו<strong>תהי לרצון תמיד עבודת ישראל</strong> עמך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All the above prayers explicitly declare our aspiration to continue sacrificing in the Beis Hamikdash.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -8)\n\n<p>No, we should not. G-d neither needs nor wants sacrifices, and only allowed it because people in ancient times felt differently. It is a concession to human needs. The Rambam also states that this is not only his view but is the view of the prophets.</p>\n\n<p>  We can add that the ancient rabbis around 70 CE when the temple was destroyed also felt that sacrifices were unnecessary. Therefore when the temple was destroyed, they did not seek a way to continue sacrifices. It would have been easy for them to do so if they felt it was necessary.   </p>\n\n<p>Of course, as is to be expected, many rabbis disagreed. We still have many references in the siddur praying for the restoration of sacrifices. But the siddur is a compendium of many often conflicting ideas, which prompt us to think and to remember the past. Abravanel agrees with Maimonides and cites a Midrash.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Rabbi Kook and the Midrash states that grain will be offered in the Third Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Instant Pot Kosher Rules\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been considering getting my Orthodox Jewish friend who's learning to cook an Instant Pot as a surprise gift, but I'm not myself Jewish, so I'm a little lost here. If I want my friend to be able to cook both milk and meat dishes (as well as pareve, obviously), would I be safe in getting one Instant Pot with two different inserts? Or would it require a full separate Instant Pot?</p>\n\n<p>(For reference, there is a write up of what an Instant Pot is here: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/what-is-an-instant-pot/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/what-is-an-instant-pot/</a> )</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I recently got one of these as a possible replacement for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/13316/759\">my crock pot</a> but I have not used it yet.  While I can't give a sourced <em>halachic</em> answer, I'll share some pictures and point out some things that would concern me in considering dual use.</p>\n\n<p>The pot consists of three main pieces: the heating element (with control panel), the pan you actually put food in, and the lid.  Here's a picture of the heating element without the pan.  The inside is metal:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zq6Wzm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zq6Wzm.jpg\" alt=\"Fagor unit\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a picture with the metal pan inserted.  Note that the pan has a lip; if you overflowed the pan you could spill food onto the heating element, though the lip extends over it some so you could get lucky.  The instructions that came with mine caution against overflows and say to never fill the pan more than two-thirds full.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bw7Gbm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bw7Gbm.jpg\" alt=\"pan in unit\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So far I would be optimistic for a careful cook such as myself and using two pans.  <em>However</em>, there's the lid to consider:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0R6P4m.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0R6P4m.jpg\" alt=\"lid with rubber or silicone gasket\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The lid is metal and would collect condensation from whatever's being cooked.  Condensation is, by definition, liquid, so based on the answer to the crock-pot question, this would transmit the \"taste\" (meat or dairy) of the food to the lid.  Further, there is a gasket inside the lid made of a flexible material (rubber or silicone, I think the latter).  This is a replacable part (they wear out, I'm told).</p>\n\n<p>Food or vapor coming into contact with the lid and/or gasket would be a problem.  Possibly you could mitigate that by sealing the top of the inner pan with foil (maybe two layers), the way you can wrap food in a non-kosher oven.  Your friend would have to consult his or her rabbi to be sure.  The foil would probably interfere with some of the cooking functions; in particular, I don't think you would want to pressure-cook with a foil barrier.</p>\n\n<p>All things considered, I expect to forego making yogurt in mine; it's not as simple as buying a second pan.  <em>However</em>, almost everything I've ever wanted to cook in a slow-cooker has been meat or parve and I think pressure-cooking is a meat technique, so your friend would have <em>plenty</em> to make even in a meat-only Instant Pot.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Contradiction if forbidden relations are logical or beyond human reasoning",
    "content": "# Contradiction if forbidden relations are logical or beyond human reasoning\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <strong>Rambam</strong> (Shemoneh Perakim, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.6.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">end of Chapter 6</a>) deals with different types of <em>mitzvos</em>. He says one type are logical, and thus a perfected person shouldn't want to transgress them. He says some call these <em>mitzvos sichliyos</em>, logical <em>mitzvos</em>. He lists murder, theft, robbery, overcharging, and damaging others as examples. The <strong>Rambam</strong> writes that these are <em>mitzvos</em> that <strong><em>Chazal</em></strong> describe as שאילו לא נכתבו ראוים הם ליכתב, if they weren't written in the Torah (as prohibitions), they would have deserved to have been written. Meaning, they would have been forbidden because of logic.</p>\n\n<p>He then describes <em>mitzvos</em> that are beyond human logic. These <em>mitzvos</em> a perfected person can desire to transgress, yet won't because G-d dictated not to. If the Torah hadn't forbidden them, they wouldn't have been considered evil. These are commonly referred to as <em>chukim</em>. He lists milk and meat, <em>shaatnez</em>, and <strong>forbidden relations</strong> as examples of this latter type.</p>\n\n<p>My edition of Shemoneh Perakim has a note (from הגהות בד\"ו, my guess is that stands for a marginal note in the Venice printing) that the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s source for his first category is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.67b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 67b</a>. It points out that we find a contradiction there to the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s words. There, the <strong>gemarra</strong> teaches:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר (ויקרא יח, ד) את משפטי תעשו דברים שאלמלא (לא) נכתבו דין הוא שיכתבו ואלו הן עבודת כוכבים <strong>וגלוי עריות</strong> ושפיכות דמים וגזל וברכת השם</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages taught with regard to the verse: “You shall do My ordinances, and you shall keep My statutes to follow them, I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 18:4), that the phrase: My ordinances, is a reference to matters that, even had they not been written, it would have been logical that they be written. They are the prohibitions against idol worship, <strong>prohibited sexual relations</strong>, bloodshed, theft, and blessing God, a euphemism for cursing the Name of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s source for logical <em>mitzvos</em> includes forbidden relations, but he included those in his list of <em>mitzvos</em> that are beyond human reasoning. This is a glaring contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>The note suggests a partial answer from the <strong>Maharsha</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.67b.8?lang=bi&p2=Chidushei_Agadot_on_Yoma.67b.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a>. He understands the  <em>gemarra</em> differently than I explained above. The <em>gemarra</em> doesn't mean that if they weren't written, they would have been self evident. Rather, it means if they hadn't been written, they would have been forbidden anyways, since they are forbidden to <em>benei Noach</em>. The <strong>Rambam</strong> could mean that even before forbidden relations were forbidden to <em>benei Noach</em>, they would have been considered permitted. The problem is, seemingly the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s source for his first category of <em>mitzvos</em> is this very <em>gemarra</em>, and he doesn't seem to be understanding it like the <strong>Maharsha</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just saw that in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Kafih</strong>'s</a> edition of the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s commentary on Avos (fn. 14) that he writes it is clear that the <strong>Rambam</strong> didn't have the words גילוי עריות in his <em>gemarra</em>. His suggestion is hard to accept, as eight manuscripts/versions of the Talmud we have list it, as well as many geonim and rishonim.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any other resolutions to this contradiction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Listing <em>arayot</em> as one of the commandments that one only abstains from because God said so is not Rambam's invention. His statement here is more or less a direct quote from a Midrash Halacha:</p>\n<p><strong>Sifra 4:9</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' אלעזר בן עזריה אומר מנין שלא יאמר אדם אי איפשי ללבוש שעטנז אי אפשי לאכול בשר חזיר אי איפשי לבוא על הערוה אבל איפשי מה אעשה ואבי שבשמים גזר עלי כך ת\"ל ואבדיל אתכם מן העמים להיות לי נמצא פורש מן העבירה ומקבל עליו מלכות שמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question then becomes how does Rambam reconcile the Sifra with the Talmudic passage in Yoma. There are two basic structural possibilities here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rambam simply disagrees with the Talmud's inclusion of <em>arayot</em> in the list of self-evident commandments, or considers it a matter of dispute among the Sages.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Talmud and the Midrash are discussing different types of <em>arayot</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we choose the first method the question falls away on its own. Rambam didn't include <em>arayot</em> in the first category, because it isn't part of the first category despite the Talmud saying that it is.</p>\n<p>If we choose the second option we have to come up with a distinction between the <em>Arayot</em> discussed in the two passages. If we look at Rambam's writings elsewhere where he explains the reasons for the sexual prohibitions, we can see that they are of varying levels of self-evidentness. For instance, his explanation for the forbidden relatives:</p>\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 3:49</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The female relatives whom a man may not marry are alike in this respect – that as a rule they are constantly together with him in his house: they would easily listen to him, and do what he desires; they are near at hand, and he would have no difficulty in procuring them. No judge could blame him if found in their company. If to these relatives the same law applied as to all other unmarried women, if we were allowed to marry any of them, and were only precluded from sexual intercourse with them without marriage, most people would constantly have become guilty of misconduct with them. But as they are entirely forbidden to us, and sexual intercourse with them is most emphatically denounced unto us as a capital crime, or a sin punishable with extinction (karet), and as there is no means of ever legalizing such intercourse, there is reason to expect that people will not seek it, and will not think of it. That the persons included in that prohibition are, as we have stated, at hand and easily accessible, is evident. For as a rule, the mother of the wife, the grandmother, the daughter, the granddaughter, and the sister-in-law, are mostly with her; the husband meets them always when he goes out, when he comes in, and when he is at his work. The wife stays also frequently in the house of her husband's brother, father, or son. It is also well known that we are often in the company of our sisters, our aunts, and the wife of our uncle, and are frequently brought up together with them. These are all the relatives which we must not marry. This is one of the reasons why intermarriage with a near relative is forbidden. But according to my opinion the prohibition serves another object, namely, to inculcate chastity into our hearts. Licence between the root and the branch, between a man and his mother, or his daughter, is outrageous. The intercourse between root and branch is forbidden, and it makes no difference whether the male element is the root or the branch, or both root and branch combine in the intercourse with a third person, so that the same individual cohabits with the root and with the branch. On this account it is prohibited to marry a woman and her mother, the wife of the father or of the son; for in all these cases there is the intercourse between one and the same person on the one side and root and branch on the other.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp185.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here it seems that for some of the forbidden sexual relationships the prohibition is essentially just a \"fence\" to keep people away from doing something that is actually bad. It makes sense that those would not be included in the category of self-evident commandments. It is not a \"defect of the soul\", as Rambam calls it, to desire those sins. Thus, when it comes to those, one could truthfully say \"I want to lie with that woman, and I'm only refraining because God commanded me to\". On the other hand, some of the other forbidden relationships are apparently inherently repugnant, such as a man and his daughter. In such a case one could indeed argue that it is a defect of the soul to desire that. One should not say \"I want to lie with my daughter but God's commandment prevents me\"; rather, he should not want to lie with his daughter.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is possible that Rambam understands the Talmud in Yoma to be talking about the self-evident <em>arayot</em>, while the Midrash in Sifra is talking about the non-self-evident <em>arayot</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the rule regarding a dead person's shomer during a flight?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A <em>shomer</em> from my local <em>Chevra Kadisha</em> explained to me that a dead body needs to be constantly watched and never left alone until burial. He also explained that about every 20 minutes, they say <em>Tehillim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>With this concept, I am curious as to what occurs when the body is shipped on a flight from U.S. to Israel (or any flight). In my case, I was an <em>onen</em> on the flight, and, of course, the body was handled as cargo and placed in the luggage / cargo area. I wasn't watching the body; if anything, I was asleep most of the flight. </p>\n\n<p>During the loading and unloading process, (well, considering burial was in Israel, perhaps just loading ;-) Gentiles were handling the body (I assume that they can't be <em>Shomrim</em>), so there were no Shomrim at that time.</p>\n\n<p>Does the body actually require constant guarding or are exceptions allowed such as for the circumstances that I described?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Gemara about a shomer (ברכות יח ע\"א) reads:</p>\n\n<p>גופא המשמר את המת אף על פי שאינו מתו פטור מקריאת שמע ומן התפלה ומן התפילין ומכל מצות האמורות בתורה היו שנים זה משמר וזה קורא וזה משמר וזה קורא בן עזאי אומר היו באים בספינה מניחו בזוית זו ומתפללין שניהם בזוית אחרת</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara discusses the matter of the baraita itself. It was taught in the baraita: One who watches over the deceased, even though it is not his dead relative, is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from the Amida prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah. The baraita continues: If two individuals were watching over the deceased, this one watches and that one recites Shema, and then that one watches and this one recites Shema. Ben Azzai says: If they were traveling with the deceased on a boat, they are permitted to set the deceased down in this corner of the boat and both pray in another corner of the boat.</p>\n\n<p>מאי בינייהו אמר רבינא חוששין לעכברים איכא בינייהו מר סבר חיישינן ומר סבר לא חיישינן:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara asks: What is the practical difference between these two opinions? Ravina said: The practical difference between them is whether or not one need be concerned about mice even inside the boat. The first Sage holds that we are concerned about mice everywhere, and it is therefore inappropriate to leave the deceased unguarded, even on a boat, lest he be eaten by mice. The other Sage, ben Azzai, maintains that we are not concerned about mice on a boat.</p>\n\n<p>Since the main reason for having a shomer is to gard against mice, non-Jews can be shomerim (at least bidiavad). The freezing conditions of the belly of an airplane are presumably mouse-free.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.practicalhalacha.com/c/5467/death_and_mourning?view=halachot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">practicalhalacha</a> brings relevant information to your question</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A “watcher” (shomer) should stay with a dead body at all times until\n  the burial, <strong>if possible</strong>, to honor the dead person.

Indeed, every man in those generations lived the traditionally natural days only. And this strangeness was in that man, perhpas for many reasons: For his food, and his way, or through some wonder, and this strangeness to strengthen the wonder of nature. And if so, this would be of the type that I call \"wonderous\" [according to the footnote, he explains this earlier in the book; it refers to uncommon things in nature that happen without the assistance of a (miracle-working) prophet]. Although, there are those who explain that the meaning of those lives - the preserving of his mannerisms and ways for the time mentioned, whether during his life and whether after his death. For these, it's possible that they were great people, making laws and mannerisms. And their ways per their virtues, also in their eating, drinking and clothes, and after said time, it's possible that everything was forgotten and they [the rest of the people] chose a different path. Or should you say, that no one rose up during this total of years with the virtue of knowing how to lead his generation. And in that time someone of his stature rose up, drawn after his thought and direction, and his spirit rested upon him as the spirit of Eliyahu rested upon Elisha. And if the first one wasn't seen by that who rose after him and wasn't in his time, it's possible that he learned from his books or examined the traditional teachings. And on this it is written: \"and he begot\" - that he begot in the image of his virtue, as though he had given birth to that man, from that of which he is master of the thought of that man who taught him. And what is said: \"And he begot children\" - after the total of many of the years - meaning, and he already begot, as they said z\"l in Beresheet Rabbah<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.16.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Vayikra_Rabbah.21&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [Vaykira Rabbah 21:9]</a>: \"Thus only shall Aaron enter the Shrine. The verse is telling him that he lives 410 years, as is counted in \"Bezot\" [thus]. But would you even consider that Aharon lived 410 years? We must say that in the First Temple, through the fact that they served in faith, it was named after him.\" Meaning that because they were drawn after him to serve in faith and walked in his ways, he lived all of those years, an example for what we explained about the lives of the early generations. And according to this explanation, it is of the second type from the second part [according to the footnotes, again a reference to an earlier part of the book; in other words, strange things that happened not at the hand of a prophet and one should not understand them in the simple understanding [כפשוטו]].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I understand it, R' Nissim meant that each of these people created some sort of legacy or dynasty<sup>1</sup> that was the equivalent of hundreds of years of life. I didn't see him say that they actually had that many descendants, just that their legacy lived on for that many years. In Noach's case (R' Nissim doesn't refer specifically to his age, not here nor in Parshat Noach), I would say that to some extent, his influence on the world was the equivalent of 600 years prior to the flood.</p>\n<p>Now, one may ask: In what way did he influence the world? Nobody listened to him and they all died!</p>\n<p>Which brings us to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Bereshit.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Beresheet 12</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What do the words in our work and in the toil of our hands (ibid.) imply? Prior to Noah’s birth, men did not reap what they sowed. They would sow wheat and reap thorns and thistles, but when Noah was born, the world reverted to normal: Wheat was sown and wheat was reaped; barley was sown and barley was reaped. Furthermore, prior to Noah’s birth, men performed all their labor by hand, as it is written: And in the toil of our hands, but after Noah was born, plows, scythes, axes, and other implements were introduced.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the midrash, Noach invented plows and other farming tools. It seems that according to R' Nissim, this was so influential that it was the equivalent of 600 years of life.</p>\n<p>And after the flood, he continued to influence the world for a few more centuries, being now the father of humanity. It seems the his influence completely died out 349 years after the end of the flood (plus one year in-between, total - 950).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This interpretation works surprisingly well with the view among some secular scholars and one rabbi (that I know of) that say that the ten generations from Adam to Noach (through Shet) were kings of ancient Babylonian cities.

And if the Talmud is correct (see above link), this 3 million is only 20% of the total population of Jews in Egypt at the time ((3/20)*100=15) i.e. 15 million, which exceeds the population of Egypt 4-5 times.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know what is the Jewish explanation for these discrepancies between the numbers of Jews in the scripture and the population of Egypt at the time of the exodus.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I am surprised by the question, because the answer is explicate in the Torah text (Exodus 1:9):</p>\n\n<p>וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֶל־עַמּ֑וֹ הִנֵּ֗ה עַ֚ם בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל רַ֥ב וְעָצ֖וּם מִמֶּֽנּוּ׃</p>\n\n<p>And he said to his people, “Behold, the people, the Children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we.\" (Artscroll translation)</p>\n\n<p>As to how a smaller population could enslave a larger population, that too is addressed in the text (1:10):</p>\n\n<p>הָ֥בָה נִֽתְחַכְּמָ֖ה ל֑וֹ פֶּן־יִרְבֶּ֗ה וְהָיָ֞ה כִּֽי־תִקְרֶ֤אנָה מִלְחָמָה֙ וְנוֹסַ֤ף גַּם־הוּא֙ עַל־שֹׂ֣נְאֵ֔ינוּ וְנִלְחַם־בָּ֖נוּ וְעָלָ֥ה מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>\n\n<p>\"Come, let us outsmart it, lest it become numerous, and it may be that if a war will occur, it, too, may join our enemies, and wage war against us and go up from the land.”</p>\n\n<p>Really this is no different than any slavery situation, where there are often many more slaves than masters.

However it can be used to keep us clear of danger, physical or ruchni. Also, our שכל can be improved upon with purity of heart.</p>\n\n\n",

Consequently, in those societies\n  in which that third grade religious education is accompanied by\n  a third grade secular education, the youth mature into adulthood\n  satisfied with their understanding of religion. By contrast, when a\n  community receives a third grade religious education, but then goes on\n  to receive a high school, university and an even more advanced secular\n  education, they consider the simplistic nature of religion, as they\n  had been taught, and dismiss religion as being primitive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where can I find Rav Kook writing such a thing? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I have asked this question to R Moishe Bane, the president of the OU, and he responded</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thanks for the interest.

    "content": "# Are there examples in Tanach of 3 or more parties having an ongoing conversation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From what I have seen in reading Tanach every conversation is between two parties and two parties only. Sometimes those parties consist of 1 person and other times of several people for example \"And his brothers said...\" but in all of those latter instances the group of people are speaking as one unified voice. </p>\n\n<p>Even when there are multiple people present the conversations seem to be recorded as a two party conversation. For example with Iyov there is never a time where all of his friends speak together in a single conversation taking turns - ie you don't have Iyov says X, Bildad responds with Y then Eliphaz interjects Z. Instead you have each person sequentially delivering a soliloquy.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if there are any examples of dialogue in Tanach where all 3 or more parties are actively engaged in a conversation together at the same time. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.26\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jeremiah 26</a> there is a conversation involving six different named parties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jeremiah speaks to the nation, the priests and the prophets</li>\n<li>The nation, the priests, and the prophets respond</li>\n<li>The princes of Judah hear and come</li>\n<li>The priests and the prophets speak to the princes and the nation</li>\n<li>Jeremiah speaks to the princes and the nation</li>\n<li>The princes and the nation speak to the priests and prophets</li>\n<li>The elders speak to the nation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Song_of_Songs.8.8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Song of Songs 8:8-10</a> is another possible case.

The men were distressed and very angry, because he had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing not to be done.\n  And Hamor spoke with them, saying,</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>[1st party]</strong> “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him in marriage.\n  Intermarry with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves:\n  You will dwell among us, and the land will be open before you; settle, move about, and acquire holdings in it.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Then Shechem said to her father and brothers,</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>[2nd party]</strong> “Do me this favor, and I will pay whatever you tell me.\n  Ask of me a bride-price ever so high, as well as gifts, and I will pay what you tell me; only give me the maiden for a wife.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor—speaking with guile because he had defiled their sister Dinah—\n  and said to them, </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>[3rd party]</strong> “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a disgrace among us.\n  Only on this condition will we agree with you; that you will become like us in that every male among you is circumcised.\n  Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to ourselves; and we will dwell among you and become as one kindred.\n  But if you will not listen to us and become circumcised, we will take our daughter and go.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is very interesting! I can think of many examples in the Torah where you might expect a multilateral conversation, but instead, the narrative fits your pattern.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.9-19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 3:9-19</a> might be taken as one conversation in which God, Adam, and Chava each speak, though you could also say that the verse in which Chava speaks (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">v. 13</a>) is a sidebar bilateral conversation between God and her.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.12-15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 18:12-15</a>, there appears to be a conversation including Sarah, God, and Avraham, except that Avraham is included as a direct object of God's speech, but not as a speaker himself.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, [only] if we suspect that a kid can hurt himself physically or stray from the religious path we should not insist on satisfying our will. If none is at stake, acc. to the Rambam it is a Mitzvah to rebuke and reprimand one's kids for keeping Mitzvos.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, that's how I learned this Sugya with my Chevrusah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the mitzvah of tzedakah dependent on?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We learn in the Rambam commentary on Avos (3:19) that it is preferable to give a little bit of tzedakah to many people than  a few large amounts to a few people.</p>\n\n<p>When does one fulfil the mitzvah of tzedakah; when one gives it each time or when one separates a large sum from his pay? Basically: are you considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah each time you give, which would complement the view of the Rambam?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>There are two inter-related but separate <em>mitzvot</em> here</strong>, one of <em>tzedakah</em> and another of <em>maaser</em>, separating from one's income (some opinions dispute if <em>maaser</em> is really a formal <em>mitzva</em> or a highly praiseworthy custom one should follow).</p>\n\n<p>R Avrohom Chaim Feuer writes in his book <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195145.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The tzedakah treasury</a> (pp. 122ff)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The mitzvah of <em>tzedakah</em> is really only half of the story of charity\n  distribution. The second half of the story is a separate mitzvah\n  called <em>maaser</em>, tithing, which serves to define exactly how much should\n  optimally be given away.</p>\n  \n  <p>A person who distributes <em>tzedakah</em> haphazardly, without specifically\n  setting aside <em>maaser</em>, has earned only the mitzvah of <em>tzedakah</em>. One\n  who carefully sets aside <em>maaser</em> and distributes it charitably has\n  gained two <em>mitzvos</em>, both <em>maaser</em> and <em>tzedakah.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He explains further that by separating <em>maaser</em> one elevates the status of the money left, by demonstrating that everything is a present from God and even that which remains for personal use is truly God's gift. In a deeper sense, separating <em>maaser</em> demonstrates one has no absolute power on his possessions and all one owns is in partnership with Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding giving away in small sums, businesshalacha <a href=\"https://www.businesshalacha.com/en/newsletter/tzedakah-preference\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> explains this is beneficial to cultivate a trait of generosity, to support more people or to increase the chance one of the recipient will be really worthy. But others give counter examples, e.g., the Chofetz Chaim felt it was preferable to lend a larger amount if it will prevent that borrower from becoming destitute, since one also fulfills the mitzvah of supporting the poor.</p>\n\n<p>Note the halacha codifies the idea of not giving to one person (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.257.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 257:9</a>) but not the one to fragment one's <em>tzedakah</em> over many large gifts.

    "content": "# How can I calculate the number of days in a Hebrew month in a given year\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom, I am creating some pastoral care software for synagogues. One feature is the tracking of anniversary dates of life events - simchas, yahrzeits, etc. For this, I allow the user to set a reminder in advance of that date - 'Remind me x days before the anniversary date'. So, I may need to know the number of days in the previous month (or months). Eg. If the special event occurs 2nd Tishrei, and the reminder is 7 days before, I need to know first what month that would be (inc. accommodations for leap year Adar II) and how many days in the previous month. </p>\n\n<p>Given that the number of days in several Hebrew months varies and with leap years, so does the number of months, I'm looking for a reliable mathematical way to programmatically calculate the number of days in the preceding month of that given Hebrew year. </p>\n\n<p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To somewhat condense some of the previous comments - As long as the anniversary as well as the # of days behind don't cross into either Cheshvan or Kislev, the month lengths are known and constant. Even Adar I and II have fixed lengths, and leap years occur during specific points in the 19 year cycle. As for Cheshvan and Kislev, you would have to know the starting dates of Rosh Hashanna for both the current and following years to determine the year length, and that will, in turn dictate the length of Cheshvan and Kislev.</p>\n\n<p>That's not so simple as Rosh Hashannah's date starts with knowing the <em>molad</em> and then, there are 4 rules that could postpone that date by 1 or two days. Or, you can create a \"lookup table\" by entering the year and the \"type of year\" or year length, and use that. You can find that info online in various places.</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, I wrote a Visual Basic program with Excel to calculate all this. If you're interested, inform me. I will warn that I won't have time to hunt for it for several weeks, though.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which produce is Kosher in Israel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When one goes to a produce store or market in Israel, how does one know which stores he can buy from - that laws of trumah, ma'aser, orla, etc. have been done? Do the stores display a certificate? Are such stores listed online so that one can know in advance where to go? What about in larger \"chain\" supermarkets?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shops and manufacturers have kashrut certificates, just like restaurants. And packed products also have them.</p>\n\n<p>The large chain supermarkets are kosher, except for \"Tiv Taam\". That one exists specifically to be the \"not-kosher\" chain - that's what they're all about. As pointed out in a comment, there are also smaller Russian chains that operate on the same principle - they're not kosher. You can't mistake those for anything else - they have everything written in Russian, and only then in Hebrew. Smaller non-chain supermarkets, especially in Tel Aviv, as well as the convenience stores at gas stations, would, for the most part, not be kosher because they work on Sabbath, but their products would still be kosher. During Passover, non-kosher supermarkets might choose to continue selling bread, even if most of the year their products are the usual Israeli-manufactured kosher fare.</p>\n\n<p>As far as produce, manufacturers in Israel are kosher - otherwise they'd lose a huge chunk of the market. So you can look for the certificate of the shop or the market stand, but there's really no need. The obvious exception is stuff that is by its very nature not kosher, such as pork.</p>\n\n<p>An important exception is wine: many boutique wineries in Israel can't afford the extra pay for kashrut (the price of the certificate, ma'aser, not working on Saturday even as a visiting centre). Specialised wine shops would usually opt to carry those wines rather than have a kosher certificate. You can always ask for kosher wine recommendation in such a place.</p>\n\n<p>In general, if in doubt, you can always ask. The great advantage of being in the Jewish state. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'd like to add that when speaking about fruits and vegetables specifically, generally the shops will have a certificate displayed, if you can't see it ask them to point it out to you. In supermarkets (especially in Chareidi areas) each type of produce usually has a hechsher printed next to the name display.\nIf you do end up by mistake buying produce which you are not sure about, the procedure for separating terumos and maasros is fairly straightforward. Ask your LOR (or mi yodeya!) how to do it if you end up in that situation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "\"A y'vama acquires herself through chalitza\", really?",
    "content": "# \"A y'vama acquires herself through chalitza\", really?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first <em>mishnayos</em> of <em>Kidushin</em>, in Sefaria's Silverstein translation, bracketed remarks omitted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A woman is acquired in three ways, and she acquires herself in two ways. She is acquired by money, by writ, and by cohabitation.... And she acquires herself with a get and with the death of her husband.</p>\n<p>A yevamah is acquired by cohabitation, and she acquires herself with chalitzah and with the death of the yavam.</p>\n<p>A Hebrew bondsman is acquired by money and by writ. And he acquires himself with years, and with the Jubilee (yovel), and with monetary deduction. The Hebrew handmaid, in addition, acquires herself with signs. A \"bored\" bondsman is acquired by boring (of the ear), and he acquires himself with yovel and with the death of the master.</p>\n<p>A Canaanite bondsman is acquired by money, writ, and chazakah (proprietary act). And he acquires himself by money..., and by a writ (of manumission)....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Something is funny here.</p>\n<p>In most of these cases, the \"acquires himself\" is a reversal of the \"is acquired\". A woman becomes a wife through money, and thereafter loses that wifehood through a <em>get</em> (bill of divorce). A Jewish servant becomes such by the transfer of money, and thereafter leaves servitude by the passage of years.</p>\n<p>But for a <em>y'vama</em>, it's different. This is someone whose husband died childless and who therefore should marry his brother. That marriage is effected, as the <em>mishna</em> notes, through intercourse. And it thereafter ends — well, through a <em>get</em> or the death of the new husband. <em>Chalitza</em> doesn't end the marriage: it ends the half-married state that the woman is in immediately after her husband dies. Listing it in parallel to the other \"acquires himself\"s is misleading; why does the <em>mishna</em> do it? I'd think it would say she acquires herself through <em>get</em> or the husband's death.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'd think it would say she acquires herself through get or the husband's death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There would be no point of writing the Mishnah this way, because it would be redundant. We already have been told that a woman becomes unmarried via a <em>get</em> or the death of her husband. The Mishnah is trying to tell us how status changes are effected; the status change that has not yet been explored is how a woman who is bound to her brother-in-law can get released from that bond. The Mishnah therefore tells us that that bond can be severed either by the death of the brother-in-law, or by the performance of <em>chalitzah</em>.</p>\n<p>This is kind of alluded to in the comments of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaiah di Trani the Elder</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tosafot Rid Kiddushin 2a</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקונה את עצמה בחליצה האי קונה את עצמה דיבמה לא דמי לקונה את עצמה דאשה דההוא קאי אלאחר שנקנת לבעלה והאי קאי קודם שנקנת ליבמה דאי לאחר שנקנת לו בביא' הרי היא ככל הנשים ומפטרא בגט ולא בחליצה</p>\n<p>And she acquires herself via <em>chalitza</em>: This \"acquires herself\" of a <em>yevamah</em> is not the same as the \"acquires herself\" of a woman. For that is referring to after she was acquired to her husband, while this is referring to before she is acquired to her <em>yavam</em>. For if [this one] was [referring] to after she is acquired to him [the <em>yavam</em>] via sexual intercourse, she would be like all other woman and be released with a <em>get</em> and not via <em>chalitza</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<h2>(Edit:</h2>\n\n<p>Now that I reread your question it seems your question is why by the first case <em>(and all the other ones except the Yevama one)</em> the word \"s/he\" in the words \"And s/he acquires herself\" is referring to the person after s/he was aquired, but in the case of the Yevama the word \"she\" in the same words is referring to the Yevama before she was acquired.<br>\nThe answers to this is:<br>\n<strong>1.</strong> that a Yevama is different then the other cases since a Yevama was already semi-acquired (see below) (before she gets aquired by the Yovom) but all the other cases not (they were either 1. free or 2. the way they aquire themselves did not change before and after they were aquired by the new person or 3. in the case of a Jewish handmade, while she was a young daughter, her father did not aquire her but always owned her)<br>\n<strong>2.</strong> The Minshna respects the brain/storage space of Jews and tries to condense (and sort) information as much as possible, even if it does not come out as perfect/beautiful/simple as if it would be in an uncondensed way)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Original answer</h2>\n\n<p>understanding what is acquired should make this question answer itself</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>What is being <strong>acquired</strong>?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>by a wife</strong> it is the\nthe exclusive right for <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1096&pgnum=241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">marital relations</a> (this exclusivity is protected by the potential fine of the death penalty (of both parties involved in its violation)).<br>\n(related <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93653/wifes-obligation-to-submit-to-her-husband-for-relations\">Wife's obligation to submit to her husband for relations</a> )</p>\n\n<p><strong>By a slave</strong> it is the right for the work of his hands, (this is right is protected by the owner having the right to force his slave to work)</p>\n\n<p><em>(<strong>By a handmaid</strong> she is like a slave (above) and The right for the owner or his son to marry her was also aquired by her owner</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><strong>The Mishna</strong>:</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A woman is acquired in three ways...</strong>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>means now she (the exclusive right for marital relations with her) belongs to one man <em>(although she (if a virgin) has the right to wait for one year to prepare herself for the first relations)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>And she</strong> (a wife) <strong>acquires herself...</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>means is that now this right belongs to her, meaning that she can sell herself/this-right <em>(in other words get married)</em> to another man.   </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(A Yevama by definition is:<br>\n 1.

This is the reason you can put different types of pots on a cold clean dry stove-pot (and if it is warm it is permitted since the heat acts as <em>libun</em>, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.451.4?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.451&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brura 451:34</a>).</p>\n\n<p>If they are not dry and clear, one should clean/dry the surface before placing something else on it.

The general guidance is that, for a cold surface</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if the liquid was cold and the pot was hot (say cold milk spilled on the table where you put a meat pot afterwards), the pot needs <em>hagala</em> (to be koshered) and the food is permitted (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.92.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 92:7</a>)</li>\n<li>if the liquid and pot were cold, one rinses the pot and surface in cold or lukewarm (not hot) water</li>\n<li>if the liquid was hot and the pot was cold, the food is kosher and the pot might be as well (need to ask a <em>rav</em>)</li>\n<li>if the liquid and pot were hot, the pot and countertop need <em>hagala</em> and the food is permitted if there is 60 times more food than the quantity of liquid</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the surface in discussion is hot (e.g., a stovepot or a hotplate) or near the fire, then everything becomes more serious and comparable to the hot/hot case above.</p>\n\n<p>But again in all these cases it is very important to ask a <em>rav</em> in case of practical issues since small differences in the reality can have a significant impact on the <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading see <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422608975.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The kosher kitchen</a> pp. 167ff, <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=3984\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-7-the-kitchen-utensils/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> and the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/download/file/fid/4059\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

I went through the list and couldn't spot a specific pattern that would clearly show that those Mitzvos only apply to Dor Ha'Aretz (like appointing a king or exterminating the 7 nations).</p>\n<p>If my assumption is right, why those 199 Mitzvos weren't commanded by G-d upon Dor Hamidbar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer is that they were. Chazal learn this from Parashat Behar. If the commandment of Shemita, which had no application at all in the wilderness, was taught at Mt. Sinai explicitly,  we learn all of the commandments were taught there (Rashi and Sifra).</p>\n\n<p>Also, the location of a mitzvah in the text of the Torah has nothing at all to do with when it was taught chronologically. For instance, the laws of the Red Heifer were taught before Sinai, and they are among the latest mitzvot brought in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Use of the singular word 'Mitzvah' in Devarim 7:11\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The last verse in Parshas Vaeschanan (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9971#v11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 7:11</a>) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְשָֽׁמַרְתָּ֨ אֶת־הַמִּצְוָ֜ה וְאֶת־הַֽחֻקִּ֣ים\nוְאֶת־הַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָֽנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛ הַיּ֖וֹם\nלַֽעֲשׂתָֽם:</p>\n<p>You shall therefore, observe the commandments, the\nstatutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Passuk, while exhorting us to follow the Torah, uses 3 different words to refer to various precepts in the Torah: Mitzvah, Chukim, and Mishpatim. The first of that list, Mitzvah, is written in the singular, while the other two are plural. It seemingly makes more sense for it to be plural (since the context of the Passuk seems to be referring to keeping all the Mitzvos), so why does the Torah use the singular version of 'Mitzvah' when the plural 'Mitzvos' would seem to make more sense?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'm aware that a lot of places (including the quote I have above) still seem to translate 'Mitzvah' in the plural ('commandments'), but that seems to be due to making an inexact translation. The word 'Mitzvah' is clearly singular, so while a contextual, inexact translation could be written as plural, the literal definition is quite plainly singular.</p>\n<p><em>Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures</em>, published by JPS (found on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>) gives a very creative translation of this Passuk which definitely does not fit with the simple definition, but if anyone could find the source for why they translate it in that manner, I guess that could be an answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֨ אֶת־הַמִּצְוָ֜ה וְאֶת־הַֽחֻקִּ֣ים וְאֶת־הַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֗ים\nאֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛ הַיּ֖וֹם לַעֲשׂוֹתָֽם׃ (פ)</p>\n<p>Therefore,\nobserve faithfully the Instruction—the laws and the rules—with which I\ncharge you today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Rambam (this is not the only interpretation) Makkos 3,16 The Passuk could be referring to doing <strong>all of one Mitzva</strong> the result of which one will attain Olam Haba (see Rashi who says on the passuk is referring to attainment of world to come\"היום לעשותם\" - ולמחר לעולם הבא ליטול שכרם):  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי חנניא בן עקשיא אומר רצה הקב\"ה לזכות את ישראל לפיכך הרבה להם תורה וכו' - מעקרי האמונה בתורה <strong>כשיקיים אדם מצוה מתרי״ג מצות כראוי וכהוגן ולא ישתף עמה כוונה מכוונת העולם בשום פנים אלא שיעשה אותה לשמה מאהבה כמו שבארתי לך הנה זכה בה לחיי העולם הבא</strong> ועל זה אמר רבי חנניא כי המצות בהיותם הרבה אי אפשר שלא יעשה אדם בחייו אחת מהם על מתכונתה ושלמותה ובעשותו אותה המצוה תחיה נפשו באותו מעשה וממה שיורה על העיקר הזה מה ששאל ר׳ חנניא בן תרדיון מה אני לחיי עוה״ב והשיבו המשיב כלום בא מעשה לידך כלומר נזדמן לך לעשות מצוה כהוגן השיבו כי נזדמנה לו מצות צדקה על דרך שלימות ככל מה שאפשר וזכה לחיי העוה׳׳ב ופירוש הפסוק ה׳ חפץ למען צדקו לצדק את ישראל למען כי יגדיל תורה ויאדיר:<br>\n  (I've only translated the bold Hebrew)<strong>When a person does one Mitzva from 613 as Hashem wishes without any ulterior sorely motive whatsoever rather he does that Mitzva purely for the sake of love of Hashem for this he has attained the world to come</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Strange Hava Amina in Yevamot 55b\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Gemara Yevamot 55b (Soncino's Translation)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>what, however, can be said, according to him who maintains [that for such an act one is] guilty? - The exclusion is rather that of intercourse with a dead woman. Since it might have been assumed that, as [a wife], even after her death, is described as his kin, one should be guilty for [intercourse with] her [as for that] with a married woman, hence we were taught [that one is exonerated].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there is a Hava Amina, before the teaching of a redundant verse, that a man who sleeps with a married woman, after her death, is Chayav as if she was alive. Sheer is obviously not a sign that she is still married to him. Following this logic if he has intercourse with his dead mother is it an incest? Obviously not.</p>\n\n<p>In Gemara, each Hava Amina needs to be understood because it contains a rational argument. I don't understand how such a case can be viewed as an adultery. Can someone help me to understand better the Hava Amina?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Why  it is obvious that Halacha would not view someone having relations with his dead mother as incest?</p>\n<p>In relation to the question being asked,  there is a posuk which says  a woman is still considered her husbands wife after her death (in regard to other halachos). The hava amina therefore was that it is a gezaros hakosuv that  a woman is still considered her husbands wife after her death in regard to ALL laws. Including relations. (Rashi)</p>\n<p>Once the Torah gives  her the halachic status of his wife after death why <em>shouldn't</em> relations with her be adultery?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>IMHO the answer lies here:</p>\n\n<p>נדרים פא ב</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר מר ושלא אשמש מטתי יפר משום דברים שבינו לבינה היכי דמי אילימא דאמרה\n  הנאת תשמישי עליך למה לי הפרה הא משועבדת ליה אלא באומרת הנאת תשמישך עלי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One sage said: (If a wife vows) not to have sex (with her husband) - the husband can nullify the vow - It's a vow is in the context of their relationship. How is it? If she said \"I forbid you to enjoy from sex with me\" - why should he (to nullify, it's needless)? <strong>She (her body) owned by him (for this purpose)</strong>, but she was saying \"I forbid myself the enjoyment from sex with you\"...</p>\n\n<p><em>Nedarim</em> (vows) are 'attached' to real, physical object. That means that the husband has <strong><em>some</em></strong> ownership on his wife's body (and vice verse, BTW).</p>\n\n<p>Who says that this ownership is void after death? (but don't have intercourse with dead bodies!!!)</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, I am not sure it is reasonable to presume that a dominant scientific paradigm can be \"easily\" disproven even if it where incorrect.  It is dominant for a reason.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, while we could (but shouldn't) have a whole discussion of how to use terminology, a discussion of \"factual based arguments\", which I would take to best apply to material or concrete evidence, would be off topic here. Any way in which this question  is relevantly addressed <em>here</em> would be philosophical/theological in nature as would be the arguments.</p>\n\n<p>It is also worthwhile to be aware that throughout the Orthodox world many, if not most, do not believe the Theory of Evolution is incorrect or problematic.  While there is a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30000/899\">traditional preference for preserving the literal interpretation of Scriptures</a> there are plenty who do not in this case and are not without some measure of support in doing so. It is worthwhile not to beg this question in a forum such as this.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, and more to the point, the very notion of Creation יש מאין as described in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/697/899\">Genesis implies a world that would have appeared to have had prior existence of both the material and the processes which typically created them.</a> There is not necessarily reason to \"disprove\" processes which are said to have transpired prior to this point. To be certain, difficult questions remain, but probably not more difficult than uprooting a centerpiece of modern science.</p>\n\n\n",

We can't get a handle on this whatsoever, let alone deign to compare ourselves, so in that sense, we are closer to ants, to whom we can get a handle and compare ourselves to. [Alternatively: being unable to compare doesn't imply \"distance\", as that's a comparison, just as much as \"nearness\" is - so the truth is, we don't know and can't say (Rabbeinu Azriel of Gerona, Maharal, Ramak, Rashab etc).]</p>\n<p>As \"the Cause of all causes\" also, we are closer to ants. He was metzamtzem Himself so there is room for us and we can relate to Him, and this is in the realms of Adam Kadmon, and Atzilus. These realms are an infinite number of steps above our ability to comprehend or relate to, and all the extreme statements of the Rambam in the Moreh apply. It is stated that regarding Him as the Cause of all causes Himself, these ineffable realms are just as far from Him as physical pebbles are - even though from our point of view there is an infinite height from pebbles to Atzilus.</p>\n<p>Nothing can be compared to Hashem, as He is in and of Himself.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in the sense that we have an internal, self-contained selfhood, meaning we are able to see ourselves as independent, free, and without origin, in ourselves without any external input telling us these things, we are more similar to the Cause of all causes than ants, and even angels, who famously mistook us for Hashem when we were first created.</p>\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.15.168?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=he&sbsq=cause%20above&with=SidebarSearch&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Bereshit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4094498/jewish/Mitzvas-Haamanas-Elokus-Section-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvQRMvoOH5k\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Shimon Kessin Shlita</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K1v-Cf8gcRM?si=evKFKOVrdmLFPwFk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Manis Friedman Shlita</a> - see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/106700/metaphorically-speaking-who-is-closer-humans-to-ants-or-humans-to-g-d#comment482621_144283\">this comment</a>.

Ants, for one, have a form. HaShem doesn't. The Rambam holds that thoughts can't really encapsulate HaShem, much like our power of taste cannot \"taste\" the number six. (As an aside, the Baal HaTanya writes near the beginning of the Tanya that what the Rambam says, that \"HaShem and his knowledge are one,\" is only true בעולם האצילות but cannot be said of the העולם דאדם קדמון\").

Perhaps this is the place to recommend to anyone to learn Das Tevunos by the Ramchal and the the maamorim at the  beginning of Shaarei Ramchal (compiled by Rav Chaim Friedlander) for some the proper introductory knowledge required to begin to start to slightly understand what we have read in the Zohar.

Hashem is singular, so why the word \"close\" (<em>kerovim</em>) is written in the plural form?</p>\n<p>The rebbi explained that the Torah is telling that Hashem is close in many different ways. Although the idols (and ants) seem close, in reality they are as distant as can be. A person may carry an idol (or an ant) in his hand, feel it to be tangible due to physical form, but a person can cry and scream until he turns red without being heard. In contrast Hashem appears to be distant but there is nothing  closer than He. It says in Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.94b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 94b</a>: From the earth to the first heaven is a journey of 500 years, and from there to each subsequent heaven 500 years. Despite this great distance, when a person merely wispers his prayers, Hashem hears him as if he were wispering into Hashem's ear. That's because G-d is not bound by the physicality.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one extinguish Shabbat candles after dark if you a worried about an animal knocking it over and causing a fire?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one lit Shabbat candles before dark, had them burning during dinner, and now wants to go to bed, but is worried that a cat or a dog might knock them over and cause a house fire; is it permissible to blow them out in the interest of safety? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The practice of lighting shabbat candles is a rabbinic requirement (see, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.25b.3?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Shabbat 25b</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbath.5.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Laws of Shabbat 5:1</a>), to honor the Shabbat and create a pleasant and peaceful atmosphere in the home (see e.g. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).  According to most, the requirement may be fulfilled using electronic lights (at least incandescent ones) that serve the same purpose, at least if there is a need (see, e.g. <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/93/Q2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/01/19/electric-light-for-shabbos-candles-and-havdalah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/lighting-shabbat-candles-electric-lights-5764/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).  Extinguishing a flame is severely prohibited on Shabbat, in many instances, biblically (see, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.2.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tractate Shabbat 2:5</a>).  Nonetheless, one must extinguish flames to avoid a risk of loss of life (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.2.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">id</a>; see, e.g., <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/69603/other-sources-of-light-to-bless-shabbat-over\">Rav MiBartenura, ad loc</a>) provided there is no alternative permitted way to avoid that risk. One would not, however, be allowed to light candles Friday if he knew he would then have to extinguish them on Shabbat (see, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRivash.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Responsum of Rivash 18</a> cited by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.248.13?lang=bi&with=Shulchan%20Arukh,%20Orach%20Chayim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 248:13</a>), at least if he could light in a way that would avoid that need (e.g. by using electric lights).  But see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.248.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 248:4</a> from which it seems implicit that, in a scenario where one could only fulfill the obligation of lighting by entering into a dangerous situation that would require desecrating Shabbat to avoid the danger, one would still be allowed/obligated to light, and deal with the danger if and when it came.

Lau was upholding the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Orthodox_Rabbis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">UOR</a>’s ruling. The latter’s ruling (viewable <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/ishaycoen/status/1163734542487871488/photo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) was based on Rema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.154.21?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">EH 154:21</a>), citing earlier authorities, who permits to withhold any aid to a “<em>sarvan</em>” (one refusing to grant a <em>get</em>) including circumcising or burying his children. Upon this precedent the UOR ruled that preventing the mother’s burial is likewise a permissible way of pressuring the <em>sarvan</em>, especially in this case where the mother (the deceased) encouraged her son in his behavior. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As Oliver stated the specific ruling is based on the Rema, but the reason the Rema (and others) allowed refusing burial to the family of a get-refuser is not mentioned so I'm adding it here.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of the idea of refusing burial to the family of a get-refuser or other person on violation of a beit din is Paltoi Gaon (841-858). He includes several penalties, including not counting the person in a minyan, pulling their children from school, banning a person's spouse from synagogue, declaring their wine and bread to be like the wine and bread of non-Jews, removing a person's tzitzit and mezuzot, not circumcising sons, and not eating or drinking with him. (תשובות הגאונים - מוסאפיה סימן י)</p>\n\n<p>Paltoi Gaon's position is supported by many other rishonim including the Rif, Nemukei Yosef, Rashba, Rb. Yerusham, Rivash, Binyamin Ze'ev, and the Beit Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Binyamin Ze'ev, who is the one cited by the Rema, the reason the beit din can do this is as follows. The gemarah gives the courts permission to uproot a mitzvah if it is for the sake of the Torah. (Yevamot 90b). Additionally, while one cannot take a shevua that only prevents a mitzvah, one can take a shevua that prevents both mitzvah and non-mitzvah activities. For example, if one makes a shevuah not to eat matza for a full year, they are forbidden to eat matzah on the first night of Pesach even though these is a positive Torah commandment to do so. Similarly, a Jew can take a shevua not to help a person in any way because that will include non-mitzvah things even though it may include not performing a positive mitzvah (like burial or circumcision). (Binyamin Ze'ev 289 and Yabia Omer EH 8:25).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How many sin-offerings are due for one who (unintentionally) sleeps with his mother while she's married to his father?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.7.4?lang=bi&with=Sanhedrin&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 7:4</a> lists several types of transgressor who are stoned, and then talks about some unintentional sexual transgressions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַבָּא עַל הָאֵם, חַיָּב עָלֶיהָ מִשּׁוּם אֵם וּמִשּׁוּם אֵשֶׁת אָב. רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר, אֵינוֹ חַיָּב אֶלָּא מִשּׁוּם הָאֵם בִּלְבָד. הַבָּא עַל אֵשֶׁת אָב חַיָּב עָלֶיהָ מִשּׁוּם אֵשֶׁת אָב וּמִשּׁוּם אֵשֶׁת אִישׁ, בֵּין בְּחַיֵּי אָבִיו בֵּין לְאַחַר מִיתַת אָבִיו, בֵּין מִן הָאֵרוּסִין בֵּין מִן הַנִּשּׂוּאִין.</p>\n<p>He who has sexual relations with his mother incurs a penalty in respect of her both as his mother and as his father's wife. R. Judah says: “He is liable in respect of her as his mother only.” He who has sexual relations with his father's wife incurs a penalty in respect of her both as his father's wife, and as a married woman, both during his father's lifetime and after his death, whether she was widowed from betrothal or from marriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this we learn about two different cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For one's mother, two (R' Yehudah says one) -- one for mother and one for father's wife</li>\n<li>For one's father's wife, two -- one for father's wife and one for married woman</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(The mishna then adds one more: For one's daughter-in-law, also two -- one for daughter-in law and one for married woman.)</p>\n<p>I am confused about the first case in the mishna I quoted.  If a man lies with his father's wife, then she is <em>also</em> a married woman.  And we know from the second case in the quoted mishna <em>and</em> from the daughter-in-law that \"married woman\" is a transgression requiring an independent sin-offering.  Doesn't that mean that a man who lies with his mother while she is married to his father should owe <em>three</em> sin-offerings?  But this case is not discussed here.</p>\n<p>I looked for enlightenment in the g'mara, but it mainly discusses the disagreement between R'Yehudah and the others about one versus two.  It doesn't bring up owing three.</p>\n<p>Does he owe three in this case and that's \"obvious\" enough not to merit being called out?  Or is it discussed somewhere else and I missed it?\nIf he only owes two, why?  (Is there a cap, perhaps?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.53a.15?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos (53a, ד\"ה משום)</a> says that the first case is talking about after the father's death. (Probably they'd say, as you suggested, that it's obvious that if they're still married, he'd be liable also on the grounds of her being a married woman.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yachin_on_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.7.32?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferes Yisroel, Yachin, there (#32)</a> says just that: if his father is still alive and they're not divorced, then indeed he'd be liable on those grounds too.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why doesn't \"first waters\" in hand washing make the hand tamei?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yadayim 2:3</a>, we learn that the \"first waters\" (the first of two splashes of water) poured on the hands while doing ritual hand-washing is <em>tamei</em> (if less than a certain amount), while the hands are <em>tahor</em>. We also see that if after pouring the first waters, you touch your hands to each other, the hands become <em>tamei</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַיָּדַיִם מִטַּמְּאוֹת וּמִטַּהֲרוֹת עַד הַפֶּרֶק. כֵּיצַד. נָטַל אֶת הָרִאשׁוֹנִים עַד הַפֶּרֶק, וְאֶת הַשְּׁנִיִּים חוּץ לַפֶּרֶק, וְחָזְרוּ לַיָּד, טְהוֹרָה. נָטַל אֶת הָרִאשׁוֹנִים וְאֶת הַשְּׁנִיִּים חוּץ לַפֶּרֶק וְחָזְרוּ לַיָּד, טְמֵאָה. נָטַל אֶת הָרִאשׁוֹנִים לְיָדוֹ אַחַת וְנִמְלַךְ וְנָטַל אֶת הַשְּׁנִיִּים לִשְׁתֵּי יָדָיו, טְמֵאוֹת. נָטַל אֶת הָרִאשׁוֹנִים לִשְׁתֵּי יָדָיו וְנִמְלַךְ וְנָטַל אֶת הַשְּׁנִיִּים לְיָדוֹ אַחַת, יָדוֹ טְהוֹרָה. נָטַל לְיָדוֹ אַחַת וְשִׁפְשְׁפָהּ בַּחֲבֶרְתָּהּ, טְמֵאָה. בְּרֹאשׁוֹ אוֹ בַכֹּתֶל, טְהוֹרָה. נוֹטְלִין אַרְבָּעָה וַחֲמִשָּׁה זֶה בְצַד זֶה אוֹ זֶה עַל גַּבֵּי זֶה, וּבִלְבַד שֶׁיְּרַפּוּ שֶׁיָּבֹאוּ בָהֶם הַמָּיִם:</p>\n<p>Hands become unclean and are made clean as far as the joint. How so? If he poured the first water over the hands as far as the joint and poured the second water over the hands beyond the joint and the latter flowed back to the hands, the hands are clean. If he poured the first and the second water over the hands beyond the joint and they flowed back to the hands, the hands remain unclean. If he poured the first water over one of his hands and then changed his mind and poured the second water over both his hands, they are unclean. If he poured the first water over both his hands and then changed his mind and poured the second water over one of his hands, his one hand becomes clean. If he poured water over one of his hands and rubbed it on the other hand it remains unclean. If he rubbed it on his head or on the wall it is clean. Water may be poured over the hands of four or five persons, each hand being by the side of the other, or being one above the other, provided that the hands are held loosely so that the water flows between them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the <em>tamei</em> water on one hand can make the other hand <em>tamei</em> by touch, why does it not make <em>tamei</em> the hand it was poured on? I guess that this could just be part of the Rabbinic enactment (since this <em>tumah</em> is entirely Rabbinic), but if so, why not just require a minimum quantity in the first instance, such that no water becomes <em>tamei</em>?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why can sterile women become nidda?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Firstly, I'm not asking for halachic guidance, I have my LOR for that. I'm asking a conceptual question.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that women become niddah because of the \"death\" of the \"life that could've been\" when the egg leaves.</p>\n\n<p>If a woman cannot have children, either for natural reasons, tubal ligation (or severing), or whatever, then there's no egg in the blood, and no \"life lost\". Why does still render her a niddah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I understand this question in two ways. One, why do we not consider this factor in applying the laws of Nidda, and second, why did the Torah not provide an exception to the laws of Nidda for infertile women?</p>\n\n<p>As to the first question, as a general rule the reason behind the law does not affect the application of the law. </p>\n\n<p>There are two reason for this. One, we can never say what the true reason is, or know if there are not other reasons for the law, and maybe the reason given is actually incorrect. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Megillah.4.9?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Megilla 4:9</a>, that we may not ascribe God's kindness as the reason for Mitzvos.) Second, even if we could say definitely that a given reason is the true reason for the Mitzva, the Mitzva is not the application of its reason. The reason is a motivation for the Mitzva, but the Mitzva is always defined by its rules.(Also in law, the language of the law is what is binding, not the motivation behind the legislation.)</p>\n\n<p>As to the question why would the Torah not have an exception for women who cannot conceive, there are a few possibilities. First, the reason of Niddah being about the loss of life-giving potential may be incomplete, and there may be other reasons for the Mitzva. Maybe it should be understood in a different way. Possibly the Torah saw fit to make a general rule that applies to all one, even if the reason behind the Mitzva does not apply to their specific case. (\"לא פלוג\" in Talmudic reasoning).</p>\n\n<p>More practically, before modern medicine there was no way to know if a women could not conceive because she was not ovulating, or for any other reason, so it would not be possible to have a rule based on this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A woman becomes Tamei Niddah because the Torah says so Vayikira 15,19:<br>\nואשה כי תהיה זבה דם יהיה זבה בבשרה שבעת ימים תהיה בנדתה<br>\nWhen a womans blood flows from her flesh she should become a Nidda for 7 days.<br>\n The Toras Cohanim explains this is <em>Dam min hamekor</em> - uterine bleeding as explicitely mentioned Vayikra 20:(ת\"כ) יכול מאחד מכל איבריה ת\"ל (ויקרא כ) והיא גלתה את מקור דמיה אין דם מטמא אלא הבא מן המקור (נדה יז)</p>\n\n<p>The only exception is a <em>Yoledes</em> (a woman given birth from day 8-40 post giving birth to a boy and 15-80 post giving birth to a girl Vayikra 12,2-8) she is not a Nidda from uterine bleeding. A <em>Besula</em> (virgin) blood is <em>Dam Maka</em> - injury which does not stem from vaginal bleeding.<br>\nMiderabanan she is a Nidda for any uterine bleeding see Brochos 31a SA YD 183 and has to wait 7 clean days like a Zava Gedolah (that start after 5 days of last potential contact with husband because of <em>Poletes Shichvas zera</em>-semen).</p>\n\n<p>Chazal (Avos derabbi Nosson 1,7) explained by the Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Toldot, Torah Ohr 44</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכבר נודע כי דם נדות הוא משבא נחש על חוה והטיל בה זוהמא, פירסה נדה<br>\n  The blood of Niddah was a punishment of the sin of the mother of all living (Bereishis 23,20), Chava with the <em>Nachash</em> (snake),</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Maharsha Yuma 67a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>העונות כינה בכל מקום לאודם ע\"ש טומאת דם נדה וכמו שכתוב \"טומאתה בשוליה\" והוא כח טומאת נחש הקדמוני בחטא חוה בתחלת קללתה<br>\n  The red blood is manifestation of sin and causes her to distance from her Husband as its written \"her impurity is in her womb\" this is the <em>Nachash</em> effect on Chava and resulting curse</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So the blood from the <em>Mekor</em> (uterine bleeding) itself is impure regardless of her potential to conceive</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Gift cards are almost as safe, provided that they're to stores that it would be appropriate for the celebrant to shop at (e.g., not non-kosher restaurants and not stores that deal primarily in materials that wouldn't be considered appropriate for young adults in the celebrant's community/family). If you're interested in doing something more personal and Judaism-oriented than money, I would recommend visiting a Judaica store or Jewish book store and asking for recommendations. Also, as I said above, general formal-feeling gifts that one would give a young adult of that age are fine, too.</p>\n\n\n",

It is permitted to excavate and remove\n  remains for the following reasons:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>If they were buried there without the permission of the landowner.</strong>\n  Under such circumstances, it is a mitzvah to do so (see also Birkei\n  Yosef 363).</li>\n  <li><strong>If the grave and remains are likely to be damaged by water\n  or sewage backups, by vandalism, and so on, and there are no\n  alternatives to removal that could solve the problem.</strong> This was the\n  reason given by Rav Ovadyah Yosef (Yalkut Yosef, Aveilus 32:9)\n  concerning relocating graves in territories that were returned to\n  Egypt under the Camp David accords.</li>\n  <li><strong>If the person was buried in one\n  place with the specific intention of later removing his remains to a\n  different site</strong>.</li>\n  <li><strong>If the remains are being relocated to the Land of\n  Israel, or to the family burial plot</strong> (kever avos). See Iggros Moshe\n  (Yoreh De’ah 3, no. 153), who writes that decisions on relocation of a\n  grave can only be taken by the children of the deceased, and not by\n  the general Jewish community. Another reason for permitting the\n  relocation of a grave is when the current position causes damage to\n  other graves (see Eretz Chaim, Yoreh De’ah 364).</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De’ah 364:5) further rules that <strong>a grave that\n  causes damage to the public may be removed</strong>, even if the burial took\n  place with the consent of the owner of the property.</p>\n  \n  <p>We learn from this halachah that the imperatives of kevod hameis yield\n  when they unduly impact the rights of the public to access and use of\n  the property. Rav Moshe Feinstein (Shut Iggros Moshe, Yoreh De’ah 3,\n  no. 151) writes that there is room to distinguish between a single\n  grave and an entire cemetery. However, most authorities specify that\n  the law permitting relocation applies not only to a single grave, but\n  even to an entire cemetery (Rav David Oppenheim, cited in end of Shut\n  Chavos Yeir; Shut Rabbi Akiva Eiger, no. 45).</p>\n  \n  <p>The application of this halachah will depend on how we define damage\n  to the public, and this depends on the particular circumstances and\n  the approach of the specific Posek involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://teamshabbos.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Questions-of-Disinterment.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Ones used with cold food, [...] rinse them and immerse them and they are pure. Ones used with hot food, [...] perform Hag’alah and immerse them and they are pure. Ones used with fire, [...] perform Libbun and immerse them and they are pure. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The discussion revolves around whether this Braisa is specific when it says Hag’alah and Libbun are done before immersion. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosh, Avodah Zarah 5:34</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודברים שנשתמש בהן ע\"י חמין כגון יורות וקומקמוסים ומחמי חמין מגעילן ומטבילן והן טהורין. דברים שנשתמש בהן ע\"י האור כגון השפודין והאסכלאות מלבנן ומטבילן והן טהורין. פי' רשב\"ם דוקא מגעילן או מלבנן תחילה. אבל הטביל תחלה הוי כטובל ושרץ בידו. </p>\n  \n  <p>”Things which were used with hot food, [...] perform Hag’alah and immerse them and they are pure. Things which were used with fire, [...] perform Libbun and immerse them and they are pure.” The Rashbam explains it’s specifically kashering it first, but if he immersed first, it’s like one who immersed while holding a <em>sheretz</em>. </p>\n  \n  <p>ולא נהירא דהך טבילה לא משום טומאה דאפילו חדשים צריכים טבילה. אלא גזירת הכתוב הוא אם ירצה יטבילנה וישתמש בה צונן. וכשירצה להשתמש בו חמין יגעילנה. ויש הכשר לחצאין כדאמר במתניתין הסכין שפה והיא טהורה. ואע\"פ שצריך עדיין להגעיל  לחתוך בה צונן ולא יצא מטומאה ולגמרי. </p>\n  \n  <p>This is not clear, as this immersion is not because of impurity, as even new things need to be immersed. Rather, it’s a Gezeiras HaKasuv that if he wants he can immerse it and use it cold, and if he wants to use it hot, he must perform Hag’alah. It is possible to kasher something halfway, as we say in the Mishnah, “A knife - polish it and it is pure,” even though he still needs to perform Hag’alah to cut cold things with it, and the impurity didn’t leave it entirely. </p>\n  \n  <p>ועוד ראיה מדאמר בזבחים פרק דם חטאת (זבחים דף צג.) נדה מזין עליה והיא טהורה. וכי היכי דהזאה מועילה בימי נידות ה\"נ מהניא טבילה מקמי הגעלה. והאי דנקט הגעלה תחילה משום דהוא עיקר הכשר פליטת האיסור. ועוד משום דגבי צונן איצטריך למתני מדיחן מקמי טבילה משום חציצה:</p>\n  \n  <p>Another proof from that which we said in Zevachim 93a: “A Niddah - we sprinkle on her and she is pure.” Just like sprinkling works even during her days of being a Niddah, so, too, immersion will work before Hag’alah. This that it picked Hag’alah first is because that’s the main part of the Kashering process, removing the prohibition. Further, because by cold food it needed to teach to rinse them before immersing them, due to [the residue being] a separation [between the Mikva water and the utensil]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ritva to Yevamos 47b DH Shihuyei Mitzvos</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותדע דהלוקח כלים מן העכו\"מז שצריכים להטביל ולהגעיל הגעלה קודמת ואע\"ג דהתם בדיעבד אם הקדים טבילה יצא</p>\n  \n  <p>You should know, one who buys utensils from an isolated that need to be immersed and kashered, the kashering comes first, but even though there, after the fact, if he immersed first, he fulfills his obligation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we have two main opinions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rashbam - Kashering must be performed first, by comparison to one who immerses while holding a <em>sheretz</em>, who doesn’t become pure. </li>\n<li>Rosh - Kashering does not need to be performed first, by comparison to a Niddah who can be sprinkled upon before her Niddah period is finished. Halfway Kashering is a thing, as proven by the case of the knife.<br>\n2a. Ritva - Ideally one should kasher first, but it’s fine if he does it second. Doesn’t explain his reasoning. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the Shulchan Aruch rules (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.121.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 121:2</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לקח מהם כלים שנשתמש בהם בחמין בין שהם של מתכת או של עץ או אבן מגעילן ואחר כך מטבילן אם הם של מתכת והם מותרים ואם הטבילן ואחר כך הגעילן מותרים ויש אומרים שצריך לחזור ולהטבילן:</p>\n  \n  <p>If he bought from them utensils which had been used with hot food, whether made of metal, wood, or stone, he must perform Hag’alah, and then immerse them if they’re made of metal, and they are permitted. If he immersed them and then performed Hag’alah, they are permissible, but some say that he needs to go back and immerse them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: he rules like the Rosh/Ritva, but quotes the Rashbam as a “some say.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Both opinions are quoted in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%9B%D7%90_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Arukh YD 121:2</a>.

Then after, the serpent presents itself to Chava as a chance to gain some type a divine status. But the story goes bad, and the end is well known. The same is true with the brass serpent in the midbar. It was good in the first moment, then goes bad. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any commentary that makes a connection and/or distinction between the serpent in Eden and the the brass serpent in the wilderness?

The first one, <em>closed</em> system was used in the past, the modern \"friendly\" system is developed and applied fairly recently when many young people started breaching the boundaries. The Torah style reflects the older system, which was universally applied. While both systems seek to delineate the boundaries that the student should not cross, they do it in two different ways.</p>\n<p>The closed system of education assumed that when people were taught about prohibitions, the discussions ended there. By dictating what was permissible and what was forbidded it assumed the students woud faithfully accept the instructions. The friendly system presents the prohibitions with explanations\nand rationale. If the child understands these explanations, there is a hope that s/he would heed to the instructions. One can state that the closed system informs student about the boundaries and friendly system seeks to build the boundaries along with them.</p>\n<p>The closed system was rejected because many people started testing the violation of prohibitions to assume responsibility for it. While friendy system is universally accepted now, it also has its flaws. When a person feels that the rule is not negotiable, s/he will not struggle against it. Thus s/he will not develop own precious insights about the rule's wisdom. Teachers also need to strugle with each and every student to \"finish a job\" to have him or her accept every single rule. Every explanation and reason has a danger of being applicable during limited period of time or specific to one's culture.\nThe system requires differentiation between students based on how well they absorb the material. None of these are present in the closed system reflected in the Torah language.</p>\n<p>There is more useful information in the book and it is a good guide not just for educators but also to parents.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shatnez and Leviticus 16,4-23-32\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a question that I'm trying to understand and I would like a logical and coherent explanation.</p>\n\n<p>1) In Leviticus 16,4-23-32 the priest (also Aaron) God indicates to them to dress only in linen only. The question, why \"only\" by Lino?</p>\n\n<p>2) Shatnez (linen and cotton) is forbidden in Leviticus 19.19. The Torah unfortunately does not explain the reason for Sha`atnez. However, we know that the clothing of the priests was in particular exempt from the prohibition of sha'atnez. Exodus 28.6-8-15 and 39.29 prescribe various pieces of interwoven linen and colored wool (see Kil. 9.1: \"Priests wear only wool and linen [ie sha'atnez] when they serve in the Temple\") .</p>\n\n<p>3) This is a contradiction! That is, if for the priests they were exempt because God told them to dress in linen (Leviticus 16.4-23-23) despite being contradicted by Exodus 28.6-8-15 and 39.29? </p>\n\n<p>4) A scholar provides an explanation. The priests authorized to enter the Temple did not have to wear robes of two different fabrics because together linen and cotton led to producing electrostatic discharges that could have killed anyone near the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, the priests wore a linen robe, as an insulator of the Ark's electrostatic electricity. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>5) Ibn Ezra points out that in Leviticus 16.4-23-23, this verse does not mention the cuirass, or the ephod, or its robe. Rashi believes that the \"pure\" linen has to do with the temple treasure ?! </p>\n\n<p>6) Tur HaAroch says  \"The Torah by emphasising the fact that the garments enumerated here are to be linen, בד, indicates that during service inside the Tabernacle only linen garments are to be worn. [Approaching Hashem in golden vestments when asking forgiveness would be the ultimate in bad taste. Ed.] In Vayikra Rabbah, 21,10 a comparison is drawn between the way service by the angels is perceived as taking place in the celestial counterpart to the Tabernacle on earth. In those regions the service is performed in linen vestments. The words כתונת בד קודש match what our sages used to describe as taking place in those regions. (Compare Ezekiel 9,1)\" </p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to understand is why the priests had to dress only in linen if they were exempt from Shatnez (Cfr. Exodus 28.6-8-15 and 39.29 and Kil. 9.1)!?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The kohanim do not have a blanket exemption from shatnez. (Rashi on Arachin 3b makes a point of this.) They are only allowed to wear shatnez in fulfillment of mitzva to wear bigdei kehunah. The mitzva of Yom Kippur is for the clothing of the kohen gadol to be made of pure linen. So the exception to shatnez in other cases is irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>The reason given for not wearing the normal bigdei kehunah is not because of shatnez, but because they have gold on them, and אין קטגור נעשה סניגור, gold used in the golden calf should not be used for attonment in the inner sanctuary (Rashi, from Rosh Hashana 26a).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I will respond according to the comment that anyone may answer. I think that if the 'blue, purple, scarlet' were in any way 'woolen' material it might possibly distort the order of the materials as introduced in Exodus 25:3-7, whereas first the metals were listed, then the linen materials, then the animal type coverings(e.g. woolen goat's hair, rams' and badger skins), wood, oil/spices, and gem stones. This would rather make the order to be metals, wool, linen, wool, etc, instead of grouping the woolen materials together(an outside to inside approach does not seem to apply either - the tent of goats' hair was above the white curtains with colors). </p>\n\n<p>Other than this proposal, there seems to be two other ways to interpret the 'blue, purple, scarlet', that if they were made of linen, then their role vs the 'shesh' would correspond to a contrast of color, instead of material(shesh contrasting the white colored material from the other colored materials). Else, perhaps the colors were made of 'real silk'[Eze 16:10-14], a finer linen, which would then be contrasted from the fine white linen(shesh). Personally, I don't see it proven that it must have been 'real silk' since verses like Exodus 26:1,39:29, introduce the term 'white linen' first, and then follow with the colors, implying that the colors may have been of the same material, but I leave this a possibility. Either way, you have rightly quoted Leviticus 16:4. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I would compare such a proposition to Ezekiel 44:17-19, where the likelihood that God would have commanded such materials of wool to be worn in their duties at the first, and then later revert, seems to me a bit questionable.</p>\n\n\n",

The verse is not to be taken\n  literally, that God exists in a time zone - as could be inferred from\n  the terms <em>before Me and after Me</em> - because God is infinite and\n  eternal; He created the vey concept of time, so it is impossible to\n  envision anything actually \"before\" or \"after\" Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They translate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.43.13?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">43:13</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even before there was a day [Radak: even before the world existed], I was He, and there is none who can save\n  from My hand; when I act, who can reverse it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In that verse, HaShem is speaking about the truth, he is eternal but before him there was no God formed, neither shall there be after him. It's difficult to understand eternity but HaShem has always existed, this is also said in that HaShem Is:\nIsaiah 44:6\n“Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.”</p>\n<p>It's difficult to understand HaShem Being The First and Being The Last.</p>\n<p>I'd say that if we could understand eternity, it would look like before HaShem there was no God formed, even though He has always existed. It's a desperate plea for Israel to return to him telling them something about his Nature.</p>\n\n\n",

What now? The Talmud tells us in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua that even after one has fulfilled the biblical obligation of <em>Pru U'rvu</em>, he is still required to continue to have children in his later years. This idea is derived from the words of Koheles (11:6) בבוקר זרע את זרעך ולערב אל תנח ידך,  <em>v'loerev al tanach Yodecho</em> - 'In the morning you should plant your seed and in the evening, as well, you should continue to do the same.\" The consensus among the Poskim is that this law of Rabbi Yehoshua is not biblical in nature, but only rabbinic.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to the Aruch HaShulchon, the Rambam's view is that לערב אל תנח ידך does not constitute an independent rabbinic mitzvah, but is rather a <em>Hiddur Mitzvah Min Hamuvchar</em> (a very desirable enhancement) of <em>Piryah V'rivyah</em>. Hence it follows, as the Ramban has pointed out, that although one who violates any rabbinic law is considered wicked (a <em>Rosho</em>) and may be referred to by other people as such, one who refuses to observe this ruling of Rabbi Yehoshua regarding <em>Lo'erev al tanach yodecha</em> would not be considered a sinner. And although Beth Din could force someone to get married even if he did not want to, Beth Din would not force one to observe this mitzvah of having more children than the minimal two. This principle of Rabbi Yeshoshua is a statement of the proper mode of behavior (<em>derech eretz</em>) rather than an official rabbinic enachnent (<em>takkanah</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the Biblical sources for rabbinic authority?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am  currently learning in a s'micha program. I was challenged by one of my old friends to find a source for our modern understanding of rabbinic authority that does not require circular reasoning for its explicit authority by relying on a rabbinic source to justify itself. </p>\n\n<p>The best I could do was <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 1:16</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17:8-11</a>, however I was unable to demonstrate anything more from these pesukim other than their explicit mention of rabbinic authority to determine individual practical halachic issues (e.g. if something is kosher, tamei or mutar, etc).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT Update:\nThe full spectrum of rabbinic authority as we interpret it today (e.g generating novel rabbinic law, determining the true interpretation of biblical texts, etc) seems to transcend the explicit intention of the rabbinate in the Torah. This 'creative' aspect of rabbinic authority appears in the Torah only via its own creative rabbinic interpretation.  This presents a significant conflict of interest and raises great doubt on its authenticity. </p>\n\n<p>This dilemma greatly pains me and challenges my conception of Rabbinic Judaism. I understand the reluctance of my peers to struggle with this concept which is why I cannot engage openly about this issue. Fundamentally, I find the issue devolves onto a willingness to accept the concept of \"emunat Chachamim\" which is where I find no biblical sanctioning. I would love to have complete reliance on Chazal however man is fallible and the only man the Torah ever placed trust in was Moshe [Shmot 14:31] but that was because he was a perfect conduit speaking the word of G-d, not contaminating them with his own interpretation. </p>\n\n<p>Accepting an expert's authority to determine a practical legal question is demonstrable from the Torah as above, but suggesting that Chazal or later rabbanim can creatively expand upon the Torah is not explicit. The Torah is explicit in its understanding of the fallibility of human leadership [Vayikra 4:13]. To conclude that the Torah would sanction allowing flawed human reasoning to command final authority on Torah interpretation seems exceptional and requires explicit demonstration; which it appears to lack. </p>\n\n<p>I have a great hesitation accepting rabbinic authority without scriptural proof as it requires surrendering my intellectual honesty that I am practicing Judaism as was intended by the Torah. I would expect others to feel similarly given the gravity this potential error could hold on our religious practice.</p>\n\n<p>(A great source text attempting to resolve this issue was written by Jews for Judaism and can be found <a href=\"https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/biblical-basis-rabbinic-authority/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, but in my opinion it fails at the task as it makes a significant leap to conclude the biblical intention of the rabbinic creativity. Why would the concept of rabbinic 'creativity' require itself creative interpretation to be derived from the Torah rather than explicit mention as the other sources of basic rabbinic interpretive authority? As the author himself compares such a concept to the American Supreme Court which derives its authority to 'make law' from explicit permission in the constitution, not via interpretation of legal example in the constitution, so too if the intention of the Torah was for rabbinic authority to be both interpretive and creative, then both should have been mentioned equally as explicit. To argue otherwise is precisely the type of circular reasoning I was hoping to disprove.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Full disclosure here, I'm not Orthodox, I'm a Reform girl, but this is what I was able to grab, insomuch as understanding where the Orthodox position stands on rabbinic authority.</p>\n<p>First, some clarification. Halacha is Jewish law with a practical basis. Aggadah, which was not passed down from Halacha L'Moshe Mi'Sinai, is Jewish folklore. Today, we won't be discussing anything to do with the aggadah, as it does not pertain to our study.</p>\n<p>I. PROOFS FROM OUR TORAH</p>\n<p>The first proof comes from Shemot 23:19. There, we find חלב, now, whether it's chalav or chelev is unclear if you don't have the Torah she-be-`al peh as a guide. Keep in mind that the vowels were invented in the 10th century, however, it's clear they were part of the mesora, and hence, passed down from one generation to the next. Other examples we can choose from have already been discussed, such as how one keeps Shabbos, and what does it mean to be punished by death if you refused to keep it.</p>\n<p>I want to move on, specifically, to biblical references. One prime illustration comes from Nechemiah 13:15-17, where some Jews violate Shabbos by separating grain from the husks via a squeezing press. The Navi quoted these strict legal bindings from Torah, but none of the above are found in the Torah she-bi-khtav. Clearly, then, he meant the Oral Law.</p>\n<p>As far as rabbinic authority goes, we learn from Vayikra 18:30 and Shemot 18:13-22 that legal safeguards are to be erected by the elders to deal with case law and hermeneutics - in short, Klal Yisrael [1].</p>\n<p>This teaches us that the correct interpretation of passages such as Yehoshua 8:34-35 are to be understood in light of the above.</p>\n<p>Note that while there were debates over a certain takkanah, <em>there was never an issue between Chazal over the principle of there being an Oral Law in the first place</em>. This means that there has always been a legal procedure in which Chazal could study and make rulings. Note further that the Gemara purposefully decided to record all opposing views so that when a future Sanhedrin is reestablished, they will know that these discussions have been properly dealt with.</p>\n<p>II. HISTORICAL PROOFS</p>\n<p>Even though verses such as Devarim 6:7 and Tehillim 1:2 exist, secular scholars still come away with the claim that our ancestors forgot the law for a thousand years (citing Melachim Bais 22:8). The verse in question, however, isn't talking about the founding (or invention) of the first Torah scroll, but rather, the discovery of the original parchment. Shmuel Alef 4:19-22 is clear how the people felt about it, and they sure weren't up in arms, as secular scholars would have us believe. Moreover, one may compare innumerable Torah mandate with its application elsewhere in Tanakh before the age of Yoshiyah HaMelech [2].</p>\n<p>Regarding the Isiyim, they too were Perushim, though it is a little known fact. Evidence for this comes from the strict nature of their Shabbat observance, such as added time before nightfall; prohibiting business dealings, perfumes, labor, cooking; while permitting walking a thousand cubits and breaking Shabbos to save a life.</p>\n<p>Now, if we turn our attention to Josephus, we'll find that he too followed the Oral Torah, and ascribed it all to Moshe Rabbeinu (see Antiquities Book 3, 5.6). To be brief, he agreed with the Mishnah's ruling that Nisan was the first of the month, and that the months were to be lunar [3]; to carrying a branch of myrtle, willow, pomme citron, and a bough of palm on Sukkot [4]; for allowing forty stripes minus one for the accused [5]; for prohibiting a kohen from marrying a harlot [6]; for prohibiting the testimony of women in court [7]; saying the Shema twice a day; placing a Mezuzah on your doorpost; and wearing tefillin [8].</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that he wasn't from the Perushim sect by birth, in fact, he criticized them at first, and only after much study, came to the conclusion that what they taught was from Hashem.</p>\n<p>III. THEY FOUND THE MISHNAH IN ETHIOPIA</p>\n<p>For 2,400 years, the Abyssinian Christians have unknowingly kept a fringe of oral tradition. This is because they were once Jews who fled after the destruction of the Beit HaMikdash. In 1992, researcher, Graham Hancock, published his journal of discoveries in search for the lost Ark of the Covenant. One slice of his account recalls his meeting with an Ethiopian priest by the name of Memhir Fisseha. He recollected the way his people used to offer burnt offerings by collecting the blood of the lamb in a \"bowl\" - he used here the Hebrew \"gomer,\" which means \"finished\" or \"complete,\" and is utterly foreign to his native Ge'ez. The blood was then scattered over the stones of the tent, which, he claims, once housed the Ark. When asked to rehearse the action, Fisseha “positioned himself next to the stones with the bowl in his left hand, dipped into it with his right forefinger, swept his right hand above the level of his head and commenced an up-and-down motion. ‘The blood was scattered in this way,’ he said, ‘over the stones and over the tent of the Ark. Afterword, as I told you, what was left was poured thus.’ He then tipped the bowl sideways above the cup-shaped hollows in the tops of the pillars.\" It was as if, Hancock later reflected, he’d been wielding a whip instead.</p>\n<p>Back in England, Hancock poured over ancient sources only to discover that Fisseha’s actions had fitted exact descriptions of the Kohen Gadol, as recorded in the Mishnah’s tractate, Yoma. Accordingly, the blood was collected and stirred so as to not be congealed. Then, the Kohen Gadol would arrive and take the bowl, sprinkling the blood “once upwards and seven times downwards [on the curtain outside, facing the Ark]. . . . as though he were wielding a whip.\"</p>\n<p>Fisseha had never read the Mishnah, and yet, it seemed as if he knew exactly what it said [9].</p>\n<p>IV. WHO ARE THE KARAITES?</p>\n<p>They were basically a break-away movement (no relation to the צְדוּקִים) in the mid 760s CE. The Exilarch, Shlomo, was childless when he died, and so the Geonim, doubting his nephew's character (Anan), passed on his position to another. Anan rebelled, and was locked up by the Caliph, whom he later convinced to be set freed. Once free, he started his own interpretation of Torah, often taking on a hand's-down literal approach, such as not allowing a doctor to heal your illness (Shemot 15:26), which, unsurprisingly, resulted in his own death. It should be noted that the Karaite movement, while rejecting our Oral Torah, wear kippot and do other decrees only known orally.</p>\n<p>Well, I think that about wraps. Proof of an Oral Law is easy to come by when you know what to look for, and of course, this short introduction isn't by far exhaustive. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have done my part.

    "content": "# To what extent can a Beit Din actually force someone to get married?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/106874/13933\">answer</a> on this site regarding the obligation to procreate, R. Hershel Schachter is quoted as saying (emphasis mine),</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>And although Beth Din could force someone to get married even if he did not want to</strong>, Beth Din would not force one to observe this mitzvah of having more children than the minimal two. This principle of Rabbi Yeshoshua is a statement of the proper mode of behavior (derech eretz) rather than an official rabbinic enachnent (takkanah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In what way can a Beit Din \"force\" someone to get married against their will? Is this similar to the handling of get-refusers, in which a court is not able to actually <em>issue</em> the get, only apply increasing pressure on the husband to do so, or does a beit din actually have the authority to perform a valid marriage against the will of the soon-to-be-spouses?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R. Eliezer Melamed writes in <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/14-05-08/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halakhah, Simhat HaBayit uVirkhato 5:8</a> (Hebrew) as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to R. Yosef Karo, Beit Din can force a twenty year old man to get married either by beating him (Rif, Rambam) or by rebuking or fining him (Tosafot, Rosh) until he agrees to marry.</li>\n<li>In practice, this would only happen in rare cases, such as if a man was already involved with a woman and they had agreed to marry, but the man was pushing off the wedding without a good reason. Or, if a man wanted to marry a woman with whom he could not have children. </li>\n<li>According to Rivash and Rema, nowadays Beit Din never force someone to marry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, to directly answer your question, even according to the opinions that allow Beit Din to force a man to marry, they do so by pressurizing him, rather than actually contracting a marriage on his behalf against his will.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>A Beit Din cannot force anyone to get married. The marriage must be \"the joint voluntary actions of the man and the woman.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Jewish wedding is a ceremony rich with layers of halacha and spiritual meanings and traditions. At the core of traditional Jewish marriage is the constitutive act of a marital relationship – the Maase Kinyan (literally 'Act of Purchase'): The man gives the woman a wedding ring and says to his bride in front of two witnesses, 'Behold, you are consecrated unto me by this ring, according to the law of Moses and Israel.' The marriage is thus constituted by the woman‘s willing acceptance of the ring. Similarly, a divorce is concluded by the willing transmission of a Get (deed of divorce) by the husband to his wife and her willing acceptance of the Get.</p>\n<p>The validity of a marriage or a divorce depends entirely on the <strong>joint voluntary actions of the man and the woman</strong>. For this reason, the Batei Din adjudicates the validity of a marriages and divorces as questions of fact, but they cannot dissolve a marriage through an act of the court. Even in situations where a couple is under obligation to divorce because of some fault of one of the partners, all a Beit Din can do is order the husband to divorce his wife and impose sanctions on a party that refuses to cooperate. This is an important factor in the problem of the Agunah – a wife who is 'chained' to a husband who refuses to give her a divorce, even against the order of a Beit Din.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Miller, Akiva.

    "content": "# What is the logic in sending away the mother bird?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Deuteronomy 22:6, we read the following command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you chance upon a bird’s nest along the road, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs, and the mother is sitting over the fledglings or the eggs, do not take the mother together with her young.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leviticus 22:28 commands us not to slaughter the mother bird w/ it’s chicks on the same day. The Rambam in his Guide to the Perplexed explains that animals also have feelings, too. He writes,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[Regarding the slaughtering of animals,] the Law enjoins that the death of the animal should be the easiest. It is not allowed to torment the animal by cutting the throat in a clumsy manner, by poleaxing, or by cutting off a limb whilst the animal is alive.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same love that illuminates from a mother is duplicated in the love of a mother bird. People and birds share the same faculty for love and tenderness. The Rambam goes on to say that we should avoid hurting animals. The Rambam shows compassion for humans, too, writing that we should not eat the eggs of the bird because the food may not be healthy (or kosher) and it teaches consideration for other people. The same applies to the mother bird who sits nestled on her nest. We should shoo her away to prevent her from seeing the deaths of her young, for it pains her to see her young taken, boiled, and eaten. It may even prompt us to leave the nest untouched and the chicks alive if the eggs are unfit for consumption. But Nachmanides disagrees. He contends:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…that it was not a matter of G-d’s mercy extending to the bird’s nest or the dam and its young, since His mercies did not extend so far with them, for, if so, He would have forbidden slaughter altogether. But the reason for the prohibition [against taking the dam with its nest, or against killing the dam with its young in one day] is [only] to teach us the trait of compassion and that we should not be cruel, for cruelty proliferates in man’s soul.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nachmanides adds a mystical reason to the mitzvah but does not elaborate.</p>\n<p>My question: If G-d created birds, why should He command we eat them? Why didn’t He make us all vegetarian so the birds could live? I am interested in the birds' specificity. What is the logic behind this mitzvah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In terms of whether should do Shiluach Hakan if one has no need/ interest in the eggs, a <strong>Torah.org</strong> article titled \"<a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/weekly-halacha-5765-kiseitzei/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Mitzvah Of Shiluach HaKan</a>\" addresses this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>QUESTION: Is the mitzvah of shiluach ha-kan obligatory or optional? In other words, <strong>if one observes a mother bird roosting on a nest but has no need for the eggs</strong> [or young birds] – <strong>is he still obligated to cast away the mother bird</strong> and take the eggs in order to fulfill the mitzvah?</p>\n<p>DISCUSSION: A minority view holds that even one who has no need for the eggs [or young birds] is obligated to send the mother bird away and establish [at least temporary] halachic ownership of them.(<strong>Chavos Yair</strong> 67 and Mishnas Chachamim, quoted by <strong>Pischei Teshuvah</strong> Y.D. 292:1; <strong>Aruch ha-Shulchan</strong> Y.D. 292:1-2.) According to this view, the mitzvah of shiluach ha-kan is an obligation similar to the mitzvah of hashovas aveidah, returning a lost item to its owner.</p>\n<p><strong>But most poskim reject this approach and rule that one is obligated to send away the mother only if he wishes to keep the eggs or baby birds</strong></p>\n<p>(see <strong>Chasam Sofer</strong> O.C. 100; <strong>Avnei Nezer</strong> O.C. 481; <strong>Meromei Sadeh</strong>, Chulin 139b; <strong>Chazon Ish</strong> Y.D. 175:2.)<br />\nStill, while we rule that one is not obligated to send the mother bird away if he has no interest in the eggs or young birds, many poskim recommend that one do so nevertheless<br />\n(see <strong>Birkei Yosef</strong> Y.D. 292:6 and <strong>Aruch Hashulchan</strong> 1.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The whole article is a worthwhile read, addressing many different facets of this special mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A simple answer suggests the following: If you desire a meal with the eggs, it is commanded in the Torah to scare away the mother bird so she does not see her young taken. If you do no desire the eggs, we leave the birds alone. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Gersonides’ Largest List of Lessons\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the number of most amount of lessons Gersonides presents at once in his Tanach commentary? I find these lessons very interesting and would like to where the biggest cluster of them is to be found. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<h2>The largest cluster of lessons is 67. This occurs in a section of commentary covering the large majority of the book of II Samuel.</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now for some more details:</p>\n\n<p>We have commentaries from Gersonides on the Scriptural books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, and Esther. Gersonides used the \"lessons\" system in all of those commentaries except for Job, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles. The largest cluster of lessons in each book is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Genesis - 36</li>\n<li>Exodus - 24</li>\n<li>Leviticus - 26</li>\n<li>Numbers - 21</li>\n<li>Deuteronomy - 26</li>\n<li>Joshua - 14</li>\n<li>Judges - 22</li>\n<li>Samuel - 67</li>\n<li>Kings - 43</li>\n<li>Chronicles - 22</li>\n<li>Daniel - 33</li>\n<li>Ezra - 7</li>\n<li>Nehemiah - 24</li>\n<li>Proverbs - 20</li>\n<li>Ruth - 16</li>\n<li>Esther - 51</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All the numbers mentioned here are specifically referring to numbered lessons. At the end of each section Gersonides says something along the lines of \"the lessons from this section are X\", \"the lessons from this section are many\", or the lessons from this section are as follows\". He then proceeds to say \"the first lesson is\", \"the second lesson is\", etc. The numbers here are based on the number given for the last lesson in each cluster. For example, by the last lesson in the largest cluster in the book of Samuel, Gersonides says \"the 67th lesson is...\". </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes Gersonides doesn't list any lessons, noting that the lessons are already evident from what he has explained in the commentary proper. Other times he mentions additional lessons but not as part of the numbered lists. I only counted lessons that were explicitly numbered as part of a list.</p>\n\n<p>On some occasions Gersonides notes that some of the lessons are redundant, or that the present list is in addition to the lessons in a previous book. Again, I only counted lessons that were specifically numbered in a given list.</p>\n\n<p>Gersonides's lessons can be broken down into four types:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lessons in Character traits (במדות)</li>\n<li>Lessons in ideas or beliefs (בדעות)</li>\n<li>Lessons in commandments (במצות)</li>\n<li>Unspecified</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first two categories are very common in the narrative portions of Scripture, while the third category is prevalent in the portions of Scripture that actually detail commandments. Lessons in this category are further broken down into the different principles of the commandments (שורש) which are given as a numbered list within the numbered list of lessons. For example, Gersonides will say \"the third lesson is in commandments... the first root is...\" These lessons are therefore much longer than the other lessons – some have them having a couple dozen roots – and feature most prominently in the book of Exodus. However, even a lesson that has 20 roots listed within it is still referred to by Gersonides as one lesson, and I have counted them that way as well.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Gersonides was not always consistent in how he arranged the clusters. In his commentaries to the five books of the Torah, for example, he has a cluster after only a chapter or two. By contrast, in some of the other books he lumps a lot of chapters, or even the entire book, into one cluster. Thus, for example, the cluster of 67 lessons in the book of Samuel covers almost 20 chapters while the largest cluster in the book of Genesis only covers 3 chapters.</p>\n\n<p>All data mentioned in this answer is based on the Mossad HaRav Kook editions of Gersonides’s commentaries, namely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>פירושי רלב״ג על התורה</li>\n<li>פירושי רלב״ג נביאים ראשונים</li>\n<li>פירושי רלב״ג נביאים ראשונים ב׳ כתובים</li>\n<li>פירושי רלב״ג איוב - משלי</li>\n<li>פירושי רלב״ג על המגילות</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why would they beat up Leviim who fell asleep on the job and burn their clothes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Middos 1:2 reads (translation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Middot.1.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִישׁ הַר הַבַּיִת הָיָה מְחַזֵּר עַל כָּל מִשְׁמָר וּמִשְׁמָר, וַאֲבוּקוֹת דּוֹלְקִין לְפָנָיו, וְכָל מִשְׁמָר שֶׁאֵינוֹ עוֹמֵד, אוֹמֵר לוֹ אִישׁ הַר הַבַּיִת, שָׁלוֹם עָלֶיךָ. נִכָּר שֶׁהוּא יָשֵׁן, חוֹבְטוֹ בְמַקְלוֹ. וּרְשׁוּת הָיָה לוֹ לִשְׂרֹף אֶת כְּסוּתוֹ. וְהֵם אוֹמְרִים, מַה קּוֹל בָּעֲזָרָה. קוֹל בֶּן לֵוִי לוֹקֶה וּבְגָדָיו נִשְׂרָפִין, שֶׁיָּשֵׁן לוֹ עַל מִשְׁמָרוֹ.</p>\n  \n  <p>The officer of the Temple Mount used to go round to every watch, with lighted torches before him, and if any watcher did not rise [at his approach] and say to him, “Shalom to you, officer of the Temple Mount,\" it was obvious that he was asleep. Then he used to beat him with his rod. And he had permission to burn his clothes. And the others would say: What is the noise in the courtyard? It is the cry of a Levite who is being beaten and whose clothes are being burned, because he was asleep at his watch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Mishnah is cited in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/https://www.sefaria.org/Tamid.27b.18-28a.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tamid 27b-28a</a>, where the Gemara comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר חייא בר אבא כי מטי רבי יוחנן בהא מתניתא אמר הכי אשריהם לראשונים שאפילו על אונס שינה עושין דין שלא על אונס שינה על אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Chiya bar Abba said: \"When R' Yochanan would reach this Mishnah, he would say thus: 'Praise unto the early ones, for even on unintentional sleep they would mete out judgement; for sleep which was not unintentional, all the more so!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Gemara clearly states that this was intended as a punishment, not an extreme method of waking them up. </p>\n\n<p>Now, as far as I can tell, the obligation to guard the Beis HaMikdash is indeed Biblical, but it's phrased as a positive commandment, as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.18.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 18:4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְנִלְו֣וּ עָלֶ֔יךָ וְשָֽׁמְר֗וּ אֶת־מִשְׁמֶ֙רֶת֙ אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֔ד לְכֹ֖ל עֲבֹדַ֣ת הָאֹ֑הֶל</p>\n  \n  <p>And [the Leviim] will be joined onto you [the Kohanim] and guard the guarding of the Tent of Meeting for all the work of the Tent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As this is a positive commandment, there shouldn't be any corporal punishment for failing to fulfill it. Even if there is a passuk of which I'm unaware which explicitly says they cannot fall asleep on the job, that would make it a negative commandment, where the punishment is 39 lashes by a whip, not beating him with a rod and possibly burning his clothes.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly, then, this is a Rabbinic institution. Why did they feel the need to institute this, and why in this particular fashion?</p>\n\n\n",

Many rabbis will accept any conversions, others will not.  Haredi rabbis tend to want at least RCA standards (some are not happy with at least some RCA Batey Din and will require a Giyur l'chumra).  So the answer is \"It depends\".  Someone who plans to remain in a single community in the USA may convert using her/his local orthodox rabbi however someone who wishes to move at a future point or is considering marriage to someone should endeavor to get a conversion that will be accepted by the vast majority of rabbis s/he will meet in the future.</p>\n\n\n",

I have taken the words ‘it is not in heaven’ to mean that the ‘full counsel’ of HaShem is down here, in the Tanakh, and that one therefore ought not hope or expect to hear any more from Him in this life. The trouble is, much of my hope had hitherto been placed in the possibility of a personal relationship with Him, and as such the idea that He has already said all that He has to say to me before I die has left me feeling very disheartened. </p>\n\n<p>What, I ask, ought we to hope for with respect to HaShem? What hope is there of a personal relationship with Him in this life if His full counsel is down here, bound in leather (so to speak)?</p>\n\n<p>My blessings to whoever can provide a satisfactory answer to these questions.

I wouldn't call them situational, because there were schools of prophets in each generation through to the end of the First Temple period. (And maybe slightly beyond; prophecy doesn't end until early Second Temple.) The prophets and prophecies we know about are the ones that have messages deemed valuable for the generations.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is not in heaven\" means that G-d gave us the halachic system and wants us to use it to redeem ourselves. Not to expect those \"general mitzvot\" to be defined by Him, but to work with what He gave us. After all, what is greater living up to the \"image\" of the Creator than using our own creativity rather than relying on His?</p>\n\n<p>In my book (<a href=\"https://www.aishdas.org/asp/widen-your-tent\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Widen Your Tent</a>, sec. 2.2) I compare this with Hillel's summary of the whole Torah to meet a candidate for conversation who insisted on being told the whole thing \"while on one foot\". Hillel said, \"That which you loathe, do not do to another. That is the whole Torah. Now go and study.\" Hillel describes the whole Torah as being an implementation of a very natural concept of morality -- reciprocity and empathy. Just as the Torah is founded on natural morality, I argued that it can only be interpreted by someone who experiences natural morality. As it says shortly after your quote (v. 14),\n\"Rather, the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and\nheart, to perform it.”</p>\n\n<p>Related is that the objective Heavenly Truth of Torah admits multiple valid answers. We have to find what they are, and of those choices, which is right for us. (For more on this tangent, see \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9093/how-does-eilu-veilu-work-out-with-an-absolute-truth\">How does “eilu v'eilu” work out with an absolute truth?</a>\" I personally like the \"two shadows of a cylinder\" metaphor, which seems to illustrate the Maharal's position in particular.)</p>\n\n<p>The Torah tells us how to best implement natural morality, and how to hone ourselves to be better at it.

HaShem’s words to Job, David etc.). I had no good reason to be alarmed: It wasn’t a very good question - my apologies again. I’ll try to be more patient in the future.

My first inquiry is the anomaly particularly found in Passuk 11. ״כל ציפור טהורה תאכלו״- “Every clean bird, you may eat.” Every other animal type within the aforementioned passukim contain a different syntax. For example, concerning the ox, sheep and goat, etc the passuk delineates a list of acceptable animals for consumption, and then lists the parameters of a kosher animal (see passukim 5-6). And no condition of “Every clean animal you may eat” is stated. By passuk 9, the passuk concerns the fish, again with the parameters for a kosher fish but no enumeration of the “clean animal” condition. The question proceeds, what is the reason for this discrepancy?</p>\n\n<p>A secondary inquiry may proceed, what is the passuk telling me that I would have not known otherwise? Is it not clear that every clean bird I may eat?</p>\n\n<p>A tertiary inquiry, although less significant is the redundant enumeration of this condition.

Namely, fins and scales (סנפיר וקשקשת). And where proper scales are identified, fins are presumed (Niddah 51b). As a general rule, a fish fillet of unknown provenance which has had its skin with all of the identifying scales removed, is not treated as kosher. Without possession of the prescribed identifier (scales), its kosher status would not be ascertainable.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the Talmud (AZ 40a) does explore other characteristics by which a kosher species may be identified (shape of the head, bony skeleton, shape of the eggs), however the Shulhan Arukh omits any mention of these features following the Rambam who ruled according to the opinion in the Talmud that such secondary features are insufficient.</p>\n<p>This leads to an interesting question however concerning species of fish such as salmon that are known to be kosher (i.e. possess fins and scales) and contain other additional identifiers that were not endorsed (pink/red flesh). That is to say, how is a fish fillet that does not possess the prescribed identifier (scales) but does possess other identifiers unique to the specific kosher species to be treated.</p>\n<p>The Beth Yosef (YD 83:8) on a related topic introduces a new siman (identifier) for accepting the kashruth of roe. He states that red roe only come from kosher species, and therefore may be accepted as such, even in the absence of other identifiers. The Peri Hadash (sq 26) strongly disagrees with this, affirming that such a hazaqah (presumption) has no basis in Hazal and it may therefore not be relied upon.</p>\n<p>Some Poseqim (R. Moshe Feinstein, and R. Yaaqov Kaminetsky) in reliance on this Beth Yosef have reasoned that where there is another identifier specific only to a kosher species, e.g. red flesh, then even where the scales have been removed from a fillet the color of the flesh alone may be relied upon to ascertain its kashruth.</p>\n<p>This position however is a leniency and is not universally recognized. There are two primary grounds on which opposition has been expressed to reliance upon the pink/red coloration of salmon flesh as a siman.</p>\n<p>A) It introduces new secondary simanim (identifiers) that were not anywhere endorsed by Hazal. Reliance upon secondary simanim is a bold move methodologically, one which the Peri Hadash took issue with in regards to the Beth Yosef’s position on red roe. If Hazal did not legislate any additional means by which to properly identify a kosher species of fish, what license have we to exceed the scope of that which they set down?</p>\n<p>B) The particular secondary siman, of pink/red coloration is one that can be produced artificially in kosher fish. This has caused some to question its reliability as a siman. Those that rear farm raised salmon routinely introduce astaxanthin, an artificial carotene, to the feed in order so that the salmon flesh will produce a pink color. Only species that are capable of storing natural carotenes in their flesh are amenable to such artificial coloration. To date, non-kosher species of fish have not been shown to be amenable to this specific method of artificial coloration. Despite this, the sheer fact that the siman can be added is regarded by some as sufficient to be reluctant in utilizing this secondary siman. The fact that non-kosher species have not been shown to be amenable to such color change via this process (i.e. introducing artificial carotenes) does not mean that other processes utilizing non-carotenoid-based pigments cannot be shown to be effective in producing such color in the flesh of non-kosher species of fish (I am unaware of any research on this, presumably the market has deemed the former method sufficiently economically viable, particularly given that it is additionally integral to the health and vibrancy of the species). It is worth noting the testimony of Dayan Yonathan Binyomin Weiss (Chief Rabbi of Montreal) who wrote (as quoted in בית דוד - כשרות הדגים הקלופים <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=59338&st=&pgnum=95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוצגו לפנינו שלוש חתיכות דג אחד מהם היה סלמון טבעי השני סלמון שצבעו\nאותו בצבע ורוד והשלישי דג קאד שצבע בשרו המקורי הוא לבן לגמרי וצבעו\nאותו בצבע ורוד ובשום אופן לא היה אפשר להבדיל בין שלוש החתיכות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We were presented with three pieces of fish, one of which was a\nnatural salmon, the second a salmon that had been dyed pink, and the\nthird a cod whose original flesh color was completely white and they\nhad dyed it pink, and it was in no way possible to differentiate\nbetween the three pieces</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though I do not know which species of “cod” (some of which are not kosher) R. Weiss referred to, again, the sheer fact that there can be a confusion between species based on added coloration is deemed by some as sufficient grounds to be hesitant.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, when it comes to salmon, when there is a choice between a skinless fillet that has been supervised by an agency that does not rely on red flesh as a hazaqah (and thus certain to have had fins/scales) over a skinless fillet that has not been supervised (and thus no simanim recognized by Hazal), some may argue that the \"halakhic advantage\" goes to the former as it presents less halakhic impediments. Of course, it ought go without saying, that those that deem such reliance permissible (such as the OU in your link) have found these impediments to be sufficiently surmounted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The two potential issues with uncertified fish are...\nthe signs to identify kosher fish and the \"knife\" used to cut them up</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The signs are fins and scales though fish which already have scales will have fins as well. Thus to determine if a fish is kosher only the skin needs to be attached. Some hechsherim have alloud fish to be identified as kosher through other means and this seems like a questionable leniency considering the fraud which takes place in the food industry and the possibility for fish to be faked.</li>\n<li>The issue of the knife is the potential it was used for non kosher food before getting to the kosher fish. This is addressed in yoreh deah (I forget which siman right now) where a knife is considered cleaned when cutting through many of the same kosher item repeatedly. Regarding the initial cuts since this is all done together out of convenience (and also not for the purpose of making it botel or by a person to whom en mevatel issur letchatchila would apply to) those would become botel in the grand total of large amount of kosher fish cut up.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

For the Gra and the Ram'hal, it seems that Ein Sof is a name. Ramhal is explicit about this in Adir Bamarom (and maybe also in Kala'h Pit'hei 'Hokhmah). The Gra suggests this view as well in the Likutim at the end of his commentary on Sifra DeTsni'uta. However, for the Ramak, and for the Arizal, I'm not sure it is true. I would like to have a clear picture of the different opinions, and the reasons for the divergence of opinions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The most authoritative written source on this subject is Sefer Shorashei HaShemot by Rabbi Moshe Zacuto z”l of Mantua in Italy, which lists all the Holy names and their particular qualities as found in the entire written Torah and Nach.</p>\n\n<p>In section Aleph, the term <em>Ain Sof</em> does not appear. That means it is not a Holy name, but a description of a concept.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the portion of your question directed to the subject of G-d’s essence (and being), both Kabbalistic teaching and Chassidic teaching explain that G-d at His essence transcends all names and letters. There are numerous places that discuss this like for example Sefer Emek HaMelech and many others.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning your claim that Ramchal in Adir B’Marom says Ain Sof is a name, he states there precisely the opposite. See page 91 of the 1991 Jerusalem edition ספר אדיר במרום השלם which says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועל כן אמר אליהו ז״ל בתפילתו, שלאין סוף ית״ש לא נמצא שום שם, כי אי אפשר לגדור אותו בשום שם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The usage of <em>blessed be His name</em> does not mean Ain Sof is a name, but rather that G-d possesses names in order that His creation can relate to Him in some capacity. The name is only for the other and is not His essence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Hashem has only one proper name: Y-HV-H.</p>\n\n<p>Everything else wanders into description. For example, Elohim also refers to human judges.</p>\n\n<p>Still, some of those descriptions are considered specific to qualify as names when it comes to the prohibition against erasing the name of G-d. The Rambam has a list of these names, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.6.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Yesodei haTorah 6:2</a>), and the Shulchan Arukh quotes the Tur's slightly different list (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.276.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Dei'ah 276:9</a>).</p>\n\n<p>\"Ein Sof\" isn't on those lists.</p>\n\n<p>It isn't even a description of the Atzmus (Essence), as no such description is possible or apparent attributes of G-d. It is a description of what He isn't. Thus \"Ein Sof -- Without End\" -- \"In+Finite\".</p>\n\n<p>In that sense, I think the Rambam would have liked \"Ein Sof\" as an appellation for G-d, had he been exposed to it. The notion of calling G-d by what He isn't fits the Rambam's notion that all of the so-called Attributes of G-d are either (1) descriptions of how His Action appears to us (\"Merciful\" -- he acts in a way that a human would when feeling mercy), or (2) descriptions of what He isn't (\"Eternal\" -- isn't subject to time). The Rambam literally compares the notion of attributes of G-d Himself to Christian trinitarianism (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide to the Perplexed 1:50</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who believe that God is One, and that He has many attributes, declare the unity with their lips, and assume plurality in their thoughts. This is like the doctrine of the Christians, who say that He is one and He is three, and that the three are one. Of the same character is the doctrine of those who say that God is One, but that He has many attributes; and that He with His attributes is One, although they deny corporeality and affirm His most absolute freedom from matter; as if our object were to seek forms of expression, not subjects of belief.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But that's not distinctly Rambam, who isn't really a primary source on Qabbalh issues. The same point is made by the Vilna Gaon (Asarah Kelalim, kelal #1, opening paragraphs). None of Qabbalah describes the Ein Sof itself, as that is inherently indescribable. Which is why we refer to it in the negative, with the word \"Ein\". We are saying what Hashem's Essence isn't, not what it is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>My personal tradition from my Chassidic (and Kabbalah) teachers, is that \"Ein Sof\" is not really a name of G-d or a description of \"Atzmuth\" (\"The Essence\") at all.</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew words \"Ein Sof\" simply mean \"without end\".</p>\n\n<p>Kabbalists did not wish to describe G-d by what we think He is, (in defining terms) because any description of G-d by humans would fall short of being exact.</p>\n\n<p>Even the term \"Atzmuth\" (Essence) is simply stated and not described.</p>\n\n<p>So the next best thing is to describe what He is not. The only thing we can surely say about G-d is that He has no end (no limit).</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

'There' you are obligated, whether the produce is [grown] in the land or outside the land. And if it became obligated in <em>ma'aser</em> through the actions of a Jew after it came into the land, it is subject to <em>ma'aser</em> rabbinically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One could infer from the words of Rambam that the obligation of <em>ma'aser</em> on produce grown in the Diaspora and completed in Israel is rabbinic, as opposed to <em>challah</em> which would be a biblical obligation in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a valid inference? If so, what is the reason to differentiate between <em>challah</em> and <em>ma'aser</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Footnotes 92 and 93 to <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/992027/jewish/Terumot-Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Terumah 1:22</a> explain the halacha. Note that the difference is based on what is involved in the completion of the work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>22</strong> When produce from Eretz Yisrael is taken to the Diaspora, it is exempt from the obligations of challah, the terumot, and the tithes,\n  [for one of the prooftexts requiring the separation of these gifts,\n  Numbers 15:18]91states: \"[the land] to which I am bringing you.\"\n  [Implied is that] these obligations exist there alone. In the\n  Diaspora, one is exempt.<sup>92</sup> If [the produce] was taken to\n  Syria, one is obligated by Rabbinic decree.</p>\n  \n  <p>Conversely, we are obligated [to separate] challah from produce from\n  the Diaspora that was brought into Eretz Yisrael, as [suggested by the\n  phrase] \"to which.\" [Implied is that] one is liable [to make these\n  gifts] there, whether the produce is from Eretz Yisrael or the\n  Diaspora. If the obligation [to separate challah or the tithes] was\n  established [because of the actions] of a Jew after the produce\n  entered Eretz Yisrael, there is an obligation of Rabbinic origin to\n  separate the tithes.<sup>93</sup></p>\n  \n  <p><sup>92.</sup> The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the exemption\n  from the obligation to tithe applies only according to Scriptural Law.\n  According to Rabbinic Law, all authorities agree that one is\n  obligated, for this produce is comparable to that of Ammon and Moav.\n  The Radbaz does not accept this perspective, stating that there is no\n  source which maintains that a Rabbinic obligation exists. The Radbaz\n  does, however, qualify the Rambam's ruling, explaining that it applies\n  only when the work that makes the produce obligated to be tithed is\n  completed in the Diaspora. If this work is completed in Eretz Yisrael,\n  the obligation to separate the tithes has already been incurred and\n  they must be separated even if the produce was later taken to the\n  Diaspora. For this reason, in most instances, terumah and tithes must\n  be separated from produce that is grown in Eretz Yisrael in the\n  present age and later exported to the Diaspora. This, however, applies\n  to fruits only, not vegetables as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 6.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>93.</sup> The Kessef Mishneh questions why the obligation to\n  separate the tithes is only of Rabbinic origin. Since the concept is\n  based on the exegesis of the same Biblical term as mentioned above, if\n  the work that made the produce obligated to be tithed was performed in\n  Eretz Yisrael, why is the obligation not Scriptural in origin? The\n  Kessef Mishneh answers that since the prooftext mentions \"the bread of\n  the land,\" one can conclude that the obligation applies only to\n  produce grown in the Holy Land itself. Alternatively, the Kessef\n  Mishneh suggests that indeed if the work that makes the produce\n  obligated to be tithed is completed only in Eretz Yisrael, the\n  obligation is indeed Scriptural in origin. This ruling is quoted by\n  the Siftei Cohen 331:22.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In other words, the priests who are allowed to marry widows will marry widows of priests (those women will be righteous) if they do marry widows.

If she had children with a Yisrael, then those children would not be able to eat terumah and the kohen (the second husband) will be unable to raise them properly. As a result, there will be a chumra added to the marriage rules of a regular priest to prevent the dysfunction caused by a child in the household unable to eat much of the food there or to be raised fully by his stepfather.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm expanding @sabbaHillel first answer here, for good measure.</p>\n\n<p>קידושין עח ע\"א-ב</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה רב נחמן לרבא: האי קרא רישא בכהן גדול, וסיפא בכהן הדיוט? אמר\n  ליה: אין. וכתב קרא הכי? אמר ליה: אין, ...

    "content": "# Waterproof s'chach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I live in Manchester, UK, which is known for our rainy weather, and Sukkot often requires a lot of covering and uncovering the Sukkah with a waterproof cover.  I have been wondering whether it is possible to find a plant with leaves that could be overlapped on a sloping frame in a similar layout to roof tiles so that the water would run off the lower end of the frame (possibly even into a gutter).  Clearly there are a number of practical problems, including finding a suitable plant, finding a halachically acceptable way to retain the structure without it blowing apart and possibly finding a way to stop it drying out too fast (especially with heating being needed), but are there any halachic reasons why this wouldn't be allowed if the practicalities could be overcome?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tosafos, as DonielF wrote, states that nailing down the schach to stop the rain invalidates the succah. This is because a sukka needs to be temporary and by stopping the rain it is considered to be permanent. Some say the problem is the nails - even if they do not stop the rain and some say that stopping the rain alone is a problem. </p>\n\n<p>The Rash in Siman 11 and Mordechai 733 brings Rabbeinu Tam who says clearly that a sukka must allow rain in. He proves this from the fact that one may leave the sukka if it rains. Why not be obligated to put up schach and there be no reason to leave? Must be that a kosher sukka doesn’t block rain. </p>\n\n<p>The Tur brings this opinion in siman 731 but does not agree with it. The Bach however says one should be stringent and keep the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam. The shulchan Aruch does not mention it. However the Levush like the Bach says to be stringent as does the Mishna Berura who says it is good bedieved. </p>\n\n<p>However, it is not clear if this is all only when the schach is nailed in. The Piskei Teshuva brings down that someone actually created schach made two layers of gutters and Rav Eliyashav and Rav Chaim Kanievsky both said it is good but the Minchas Yitzchak and Lehoros Nassan said it is not kosher. </p>\n\n<p>There you have it in time for next Sukkos ;) </p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not [<em>explicitly</em>] written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this, [<em>as it would be insulting to God’s honor.

He said to\n  him: Whenever the Jewish people sin, let them act before Me in accordance with this order. [<em>Let the prayer leader wrap himself in a prayer shawl and publicly recite the thirteen attributes of mercy,</em>] and\n  I will forgive them. (Sefaria translation, with commentary by R. Adin Steinsaltz) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming this is an allegory, what are the explanations of Chazal and the commentators on the reference to Hashem wrapping Himself in a tallit? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Benei Yehoyada, \"יעשו לפני כסדר הזה -- let them act before Me in accordance with this order\" is not about prayer. (Contrary to the included explanation by Rav Edin Steinzaltz <sup><em>shlit\"a</em></sup>.) Rather, Hashem Himself listed 13 aspects of His Compassion and told us that if we ever sin, emulating them -- actually being compassionate according to the example He sets us -- would guarantee our forgiveness.</p>\n<p>Continuing this, I <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/ike-this-order\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">blogged a possible explanation</a> of what being wrapped in the <em>tallis</em> may represent.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Simlai is the one in the <em>gemara</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.23b.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 23b</a>) who tells us that there are 613 <em>mitzvos</em>, and then shows how various prophets simplified the big picture by grouping them under fewer and fewer principles. Among the summaries of all of halakhah that he lists is a famous quote from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Micah.6.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mikhah (6:8)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִגִּ֥יד לְךָ֛ אָדָ֖ם מַה־טּ֑וֹב וּמָֽה־ה֞׳ דּוֹרֵ֣שׁ מִמְּךָ֗ כִּ֣י אִם־עֲשׂ֤וֹת מִשְׁפָּט֙ וְאַ֣הֲבַת חֶ֔סֶד וְהַצְנֵ֥עַ לֶ֖כֶת עִם־אֱלֹקֶֽיךָ׃</p>\n<p>Man, He told you what is good and what Hashem expects of you: only (1) to do justice, (2) the love of kindness, and (3) and to walk modestly with your G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Simlai continues by explaining each of these clauses. The first two are more obvious — justice and lovingkindess. The third —</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זה הוצאת המת והכנסת כלה והלא דברים קל וחומר ומה דברים שאין דרכן לעשותן בצנעא אמרה תורה והצנע לכת דברים שדרכן לעשותן בצנעא על אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n<p>this is taking the dead out [for <em>taharah</em> and burial] and bringing the bride in [to her wedding].</p>\n<p>And aren’t these things a <em>qal vachomer</em> (a fortiori): If things [like helping someone with burial or with making a wedding] which are not normally done in privacy, the Torah tells us “go modestly”, all the more so things which are normally done in privacy should!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Emulating Hashem has to be done with modesty. Even when called into the spotlight to serve the community, the And that too is modeled by Hashem in the original allegory. When He details to Moshe the <em>middos</em> we are to emulate. He shows Himself “wrapped in a <em>tallis</em>, like a <em>shaliach tzibbur</em>.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Chananel provided the following interpretation/explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צוה למלאך להתעטף כש”ץ היורד לפני התיבה והראהו למשה ואמר ליה כל זה\nשישראל חוטאים לפני. עשה לפני כסדר הזה ואני מוחל להם.</p>\n<p><em>Translation: He commanded to an angel to cover himself like a prayer\nleader who descends before the prayer stand and showed Moses and said\nto him: all this is for if Israel sins before Me. Do according to this\norder [of prayer] and I will forgive them.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There have been many answers to this question but to answer your question fully we must first define our terms. Midrashim are parables to teach moral behavior. One should not dismiss them because they are still true, in a sense. They teach proper behavior. But they are not meant to be taken literally. Thus G-d is not sitting in a throne or a tallit wearing a kippah, deep in Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>The tallit (in this allegory) represents humility. As though HaShem humbly studies Torah. Since G-d does not “sit” because G-d has no body and is one,  we are forced to interpret this verse as a metaphor.</p>\n\n\n",

He seeks out a fortune teller or the stars to tell the future.  But the point is that those concerns about the future can cause him to cave in on his principles and turn away from God and turn to these avodah zarahs.  So what is the solution?  How does a person avoid that?  תָּמִ֣ים תִּֽהְיֶ֔ה.  That you must in a certain sense accept God’s world.  The world is created according to the will of God.

Don’t let your desire for the future to cause you to comprise your perfect attachment to God.  A religious person might live in line with God, but then these fears drive him away.  <em>Temimus</em> means that the degree of attachment to God must be complete.  You must stick with God through thick and thin.  When you are successful and when you are fearful.  The Torah is helping realize difference circumstances that cause a person to crumble.  True <em>Temimus</em> is to be with God in all circumstances and not to tap out when the going gets tough.  You need to use your intellect to make plans for the future possibilities.  However, there is a certain degree that is outside your control and awareness.  You just need to wait till you find out.

The use of fish gelatin with meat\n  foods poses an interesting question. As previously noted, the Shulchan\n  Aruch (Yoreh Deah 116) prohibits the cooking of meat and fish together\n  due to health concerns. We tend to be more stringent when dealing with\n  possible health issues than with concerns of Issur (prohibited\n  substances). Therefore, there is a question among the commentaries as\n  to whether or not the rule of one in sixty nullification applies to\n  unhealthy substances just as it does with prohibited substances. The\n  custom is that unhealthy substances become nullified at a ratio of 1\n  to 60 (see Nekudas Hakesef, Yoreh Deah 116 & Pische Teshuvah). </p>\n  \n  <p>There are many reasons for leniency in the use of fish gelatin\n  together with meat. </p>\n  \n  <p>Many rabbinic authorities are of the opinion that the nature of some\n  foods has changed, thus rendering the mixture of meat and fish no\n  longer unhealthy (see Magen Avrohom Orach Chaim 173:1, Teshuvos Chasam\n  Sofer vol:1 #101). </p>\n  \n  <p>Furthermore, there is a rationalization that not all fish would be\n  considered a dangerous mixture with meat. It may be that only the type\n  mentioned in the Gemora (Binita) is unhealthy (see Pische Tshuvah,\n  Yoreh Deah 116:3). It may also be maintained that the unhealthy\n  aspects of fish cooked with meat are found in the flesh gelatin is\n  made). [I suggest the author meant to write, “It may also be\n  maintained that the unhealthy aspects of fish cooked with meat are\n  found in the flesh while gelatin is made from the skin and bones.”]</p>\n  \n  <p>Since gelatin may not have fish flavor, it may not harbor the harmful\n  effects that fish may carry (see Pische Tshuva, Tshuvos Sride Eish\n  vol:2 #67 re: cooking beef in fish oil). </p>\n  \n  <p>With this same reasoning, we can say that gelatin can be batel\n  (nullified) with a majority of other food ingredients and can be eaten\n  with meat (according to R’ Aharon Kotler, zt”l regarding animal\n  gelatin and milk). </p>\n  \n  <p>For these reasons, it may be acceptable to use products containing\n  fish gelatin with meat, or use the same reasoning to allow products\n  containing animal gelatin with fish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus there is no practical point in labelling marshmallows as OU fish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>OUKosher writes <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/gelatin-revisited/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Darchei Teshuvah cites two opinions as to whether the principle of\n  bitul b’shishim applies to meat and fish – some hold that it does,\n  while others argue that the halachos of sakanah/danger are stricter\n  than those of issur/forbidden foods and bitul b’shishim doesn’t apply.\n  This (and other related issues) lies at the crux of whether one may\n  eat fish-based marshmallows with meat. Some Rabbis follow the lenient\n  approach and rule that since the fish gelatin is batel b’shishim in\n  the marshmallow, one may mix or cook it with meat, while others rule\n  that bitul b’shishim doesn’t apply to these halachos. [Of course, if\n  the fish gelatin isn’t batel b’shishim in the marshmallow, all\n  opinions would agree that it can’t be eaten with meat].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the Worcestershire sauce, OUKosher writes <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/halacha-yomis/many-worcestershire-sauces-contain-anchovies-permissible-add-worcestershire-sauce-meat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We noted in the past Halacha Yomis that there is a dispute whether\n  fish is nullified in 60 parts.

However, if the\n  anchovies are more than one part in sixty of the sauce’s components,\n  the product must be labeled OU-Fish.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"For simplicity’s sake, some companies prefer to label all their\n  Worcestershire sauces with an OU-Fish symbol regardless of whether the\n  amount of fish is nullified or not, and the OU accommodates such\n  requests.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Their opinions led them to hold that it is permitted to live in Israel, even a mitzvah, but is forbidden to have anything to do with the govt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In short: Those living in Israel will avoid making aliya, but might be Israeli citizens none the less.</p>\n<p>Without delving into specific groups or the political aspects, it is worth noting that most anti-Zionists do not oppose living in Israel but rather question the legitimacy of the state of Israel. They may choose not to actively pursue Israeli citizenship. It is important to mention that individuals born and raised in Israel automatically possess Israeli passports upon entry, but some anti-Zionists prefer to avoid obtaining these documents as it may be seen as a sign of support for the state.</p>\n<p>When discussing Zionism and living in Israel, three main issues are often raised.</p>\n<p>The first is the argument that the Gemora describes three oaths <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths</a>  taken by the Jews, one of which is not to ascend to the land en masse (\"שלא יעלו ישראל בחומה\") and העולם שלא ימרדו באומות they shall not rebel against the rule of the nations of the world According to this viewpoint, the Gemora forbids going against the British Mandate in Israel and to arrange mass emigration.</p>\n<p>The second argument pertains to the loss of Jewish lives during the establishment of Israel and subsequent wars. Those who question Zionism ask who gave us the right to claim a country as our own if it results in bloodshed. Wars are typically justified in cases of Pikuach Nefesh or when mandated by Hashem through the Kohen Gadol or a Navei. However, there was no need for Jews to be killed for such a cause, as argued by this perspective.</p>\n<p>The third argument is based on \"Daas Torah\" (the opinion of Torah scholars). Although a few rabbis supported the establishment of the State of Israel, the majority were against it. Going against Daas Torah, the collective wisdom of Torah scholars, is seen as unacceptable in this context.</p>\n<p>These reasons form the primary basis for the assertion that Israel has no right to exist, while acknowledging the religious obligation to live there. However, this viewpoint does not grant legitimacy to the government. It is important to note that these arguments have been extensively discussed and debated, and this response merely aims to answer the question without expressing personal opinions. The information provided is derived from a yet-to-be-published book by an author who holds an anti-Zionist stance and requested constructive criticism, which was provided.

This year, the “Yom Tov” part of Sukkos starts at nightfall of the 13th and ends at nightfall on the 15th, with Chol HaMoed starting immediately upon the conclusion of Yom Tov and running until nightfall of the 20th, followed by a separate holiday, “Shmini Atzeres,” which is irrelevant to the discussion at hand. </p>\n\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Potential-date-of-UK-snap-election-changed-due-to-Sukkot-600616\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> (h/t Isaac Moses), the elections are open until 10 PM.

Your person who cannot sin isn't receiving that Good, because who he is is compelled by Another. Hashem has total Freedom of Will; being able to enjoy the good of being in His Image would require allowing people at least <em>some</em> freedom of will.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, fewer people would be hurt by others. But the total good in the world would go down.</p>\n\n<p>Second, if we didn't have free will, and we were all automata, would any of the Good He bestows on us be worth anything? Who would be the recipients of his good if humans and grass are only quantitatively different? We needed to be moral agents if Hashem's goal of providing good to others is to be have \"others\" to be good to.</p>\n\n<p>So, not only would the total good go down, any meaningful definition of good would go down to zero!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* One might argue that the above statement about Hashem's preference is only <strong>almost</strong> always true. And so the Exodus happening was something Hashem wanted more than Par'oh's being in His Image. Thus Hashem \"hardened his heart.\" The question usually asked, how that was fair to Par'oh to deprive him of a chance to do <em>teshuvah</em>, is a somewhat different one and out of scope.</p>\n\n<p>(**I think \"hardened\" is a poor translation of either \"הכבדתי\" or \"החזקתי\", but that's its own topic.

    "content": "# Automation on Shabbos (Artificial Intelligence etc)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know there has been plenty of halachic literature written about automation on Shabbos as far as timeswitches, eBay bids etc go, but are there any authoritative sources for halacha about artificial intelligence based automation on Shabbos?</p>\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence, speech recognition and related technological systems are steadily improving at the moment.  It isn't too hard to imagine that the virtual personal assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri etc will soon be capable of monitoring what we want without us explicitly asking them to do something (assuming that would actually be socially acceptable).  If such a device monitors what we want on Shabbos and takes action, would this be a problem if we don't explicitly ask it to?</p>\n\n<p>I'm envisaging systems which use a variety of sources of data - sensors built into our homes, built into the devices that are around us that we give permission to an app to access.  The app then uses all of this data to establish our personal habits and predicts what we are likely to need in advance.  For example, it saves us electricity by turning the lights off after we go to bed, but turns them on when it knows we are likely to go into that room if it isn't very light in there.  It is predictive, and we can't be sure that any particular action will necessarily trigger a specific outcome (actually we probably could, but those are easy to avoid).  I'm imagining a world where systems like this may be pervasive, and we're not conscious of relying on them, and they are likely to exist everywhere - in the streets we walk down as well as in our homes, in buildings we go into and walk past etc.  Such systems would most likely become taken for granted and would exist very much in the background - things would just happen to make our lives easier without our conscious effort. Eg. We may not even be aware that the lights go off when we have gone to bed and come back on before we come down in the morning. </p>\n\n<p>This is different from the case of timers, which are <em>intentional</em> (programmed) and near-certain to take effect (barring power outages).  It is also different from the case of motion-sensor lights, where our action triggers an unwanted outcome.  Profiling by AIs adds more layers of indirection (maybe like a <em>grama</em>?) and uncertainty, with the AI passively monitoring our actions without us directing it, building a model over the course of weeks or months, applying that model to take actions on its own, and tuning the model as it goes.  In some cases actions may take place purely based on trained data or in others they may be triggered by a combination of a sensor and learned behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there may be cases where it isn't necessarily clear whether an action even is a melacha. For example, if we are planning on eating out on Shabbat with a family who live the other side of town - an hour's walk away and one of our kids is ill and we decide not to go, the system could notify them that we will not be coming simply because it has heard us saying so, and will then tell us that we don't need to worry about them waiting for us and us not turning up.  Has a melacha taken place here? I am not sure.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Shlomo haMelekh not a part of the Oral Torah’s transmission?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Reading the Rambam's introduction to his Mishne Torah, I am struck by the fact that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">he has Achiya haShiloni succeed David in the transmission of the Oral Torah</a>, and not David's son Shlomo. I'm curious as to why this is. Is he relying on a particular source that ascribes this role to Achiya in the same generation? Or a particular source that specifically precludes Shlomo fulfilling it? David is the only king who both rules the nation <em>and</em> features in this chain of transmission, so if there is a source that suggests that Shlomo did not feature in it because he was the king, it would also need to reckon with the fact that David <em>did</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: an early version of this question asked why Achiya haShiloni and not Shlomo haMelekh was president of the Sanhedrin. Based on how the rabbonim understood Moshe, and based on their understanding of everybody from Ezra to Rabbi, I assumed that this went for everyone between Moshe and Ezra as well. I now realise that it may not have, and don’t want that to overshadow my question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I believe the reason is just technical. The Rambam is just coming to give one unbroken chain, not mention all the great Rabbis. Achiyah covers the most time and leads straight to the next link in the chain, Eliyahu, whereas even if the Rambam counted Shlomo, he would have to mention Achiyah afterwards. Once he mentions Achiyah, there is no need for Shlomo.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we ask for Hashem to rule us alone, and then ask for a human king?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the weekday sh’moneh esrei we ask HaShem to rule over us by himself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמְלֹךְ עָלֵינוּ מְהֵרָה אַתָּה י-הוה לְבַדְּךָ</p>\n<p>and reign over us- You HaShem, alone</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And yet, a few b’rachos later, we seemingly ask HaShem to give us a human king!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכִסֵּא דָוִד עַבְדְּךָ מְהֵרָה לְתוֹכָהּ תָּכִין.</p>\n<p>and may you speedily establish the throne of David within it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can someone resolve this contradiction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The kingship of the house of David is unique in that in its most perfect form, it is merely a reflection of the kingship of Hashem,לית מגרמי כלום.<br>\n מלכות בית דוד allows us to connect, in a more tangible way to the מלכות of ה'. So essentially in both of those ברכות we are asking for the same thing: that the reality of Hashem's lone dominion over the world be made clear to all its inhabitants, and that מלכות בית דוד return, to give us a deeper understanding of that rulership and dominion.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Drashos HaRan (drush 11) says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונמצא שמנוי השופטים היה לשפט משפטי תורה בלבד, שהם צודקים בעצמם, כמו שנאמר: ושפטו את העם משפט צדק, ומנוי המלך היה להשלים תקון הסדור המדיני, וכל מה שהיה מצטרך לצרך השעה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that according to the Ran the point of malchus is simply as a viable form of governing the nation due to the lack of control that would be attained governing purely by the Torah's laws. For instance, a ganav is chayev to pay double the value of the item he stole...unless he admits to the crime, in which case he only has to pay the real value of the item. If society were built purely on Torah laws, ganavim would easily be able to evade this fine of double payment which would not deter theft nearly as much. For this reason we need \"extralegal\" laws. The Rashba makes the same point in a teshuva (ח\"ג סי' שצג) albeit not quite as elaborately as the Ran (I only included a bit of a longer drasha, you should see the whole thing, or at least the first half). Also see the Aruch Hashulchan in the very beginning of Choshen Mishpat (even before the hakdama) where he has a peice on כבוד מלך. He speaks quite a bit about how the king is the \"heart\" of the nation. (Perhaps one could take that peice with a grain of salt, as some say he only wrote it because of the intense censorship in Russia at the time and this was the only way he would be able to print his sefer, but I haven't looked into this).</p>\n<p>I would add that the gemara in Avoda Zara (4a) says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר אחר מה דגים שבים כל הגדול מחבירו בולע את חבירו אף בני אדם אלמלא מוראה של מלכות כל הגדול מחבירו בולע את חבירו והיינו דתנן רבי חנינא סגן הכהנים אומר הוי מתפלל בשלומה של מלכות שאלמלא מוראה של מלכות איש את רעהו חיים בלעו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But I only remember that the Torah mentions tents, like שובו לאהליכם, אהלי אנשים, מה טבו אהליך, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I also remember that Yakov built Succos for his cattle (Gen 33.17 \"ויעקב נסע סכתה ויבן לו בית ולמקנהו עשה סכת\").</p>\n\n<p>[Where] Does the Torah mention that the Jews built actual Succot when exiting Egypt?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>No, the Torah does not mention explicitly that the Jews built actual Succot. (If it had, there wouldn’t be an argument as to whether the Jews had real Sukkot or Sukkot made from the Ananei Hakavod). However, in Vayikra 23:43, HaShem mentions the fact that the Jews lived in Succot, as the reason to celebrate Sukkot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְמַעַן֮ יֵדְע֣וּ דֹרֹֽתֵיכֶם֒ כִּ֣י בַסֻּכּ֗וֹת הוֹשַׁ֙בְתִּי֙ אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּהוֹצִיאִ֥י אוֹתָ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אֲנִ֖י יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I the LORD your God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, the Gemara that is quoted brings this passuk as the backing point of both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva (Sukkah 11b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הניחא למ\"ד ענני כבוד היו אלא למ\"ד סוכות ממש עשו להם מאי איכא למימר דתניא (ויקרא כג, מג) כי בסוכות הושבתי את בני ישראל ענני כבוד היו דברי ר' אליעזר ר\"ע אומר סוכות ממש עשו להם הניחא לר\"א אלא לר\"ע מאי איכא למימר</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: This works out well according to the one who said that the sukkot mentioned in the verse: “I made the children of Israel to reside in sukkot” (Leviticus 23:43), were clouds of glory, as it is reasonable that the roofing of the sukka is modeled after clouds. However, according to the one who said that the children of Israel established for themselves actual sukkot in the desert, and the sukkot of today commemorate those, what can be said? According to that opinion, there is no connection between a sukka and a cloud. As it is taught in a baraita that the verse states: “I made the children of Israel to reside in sukkot”; these booths were clouds of glory, this is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says: They established for themselves actual sukkot. This works out well according to Rabbi Eliezer; however, according to Rabbi Akiva what can be said?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Quotes and translations from sefaria.)</p>\n\n\n",

I have seen people (including those under 13) put one on when doing gelilah on Shabbat, but I have seen people over 13 not put one on when doing gelilah on a weekday. In some places the chazzan is told to put one on for mincha, but not in other places. Today at mincha I noticed that when people went to the bimah to hold the Torah and recite the Kel Malei Rachamim, they did not put tallitot on (and I don't recall if people put them on when dancing with Torahs on Simchat Torah).</p>\n\n<p>The other questions talk about kavod hatzibbur (which would require counting people and figuring out if a majority is already wearing one) and kavod hatorah (which seems only to apply sometimes), but there seems to be some inconsistency. Does it all boil down to local minhag or are there consistent, overarching rules that explain all cases?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Artscroll indicate that the מ of למנצח should have a שוע נע?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Artscroll siddur indicates that the שוע on מ of למנצח (e.g. תהלים כ א) is a שוע נע, but I am not sure why this is the case. The vowel beforehand is a פתח (a תנועה קטנה) and none of the other rules I know of imply anything other than a shva nach. Related: see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92599/what-are-the-rules-for-shva-na\">What are the rules for sh'va na?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ravlopiansky.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Aharon Lopiansky</a>, in his amazing <em>siddur</em> called <a href=\"https://www.eshelpublications.com/store/p5/Siddur_Aliyos_Eliyahu_w%2F_Masores_Hatefilla.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aliyos Eliyahu</a>, has a section on the bottom called Mesores HaTefillah. There he explains the sources for the parts of the <em>siddur</em>, and variant readings.</p>\n<p>On the word למנצח, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מ' בשווא נח עפ\"י כתר ארם צובה וברוו\"ה שווא נע</p>\n<p>The Mem has a resting <em>sheva</em>, according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Codex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleppo Codex</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Heidenheim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Wolf Heidenheim</a> says it should be a moving <em>sheva</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem then that Artscroll is going with the grammarian Rav Heidenheim instead of the earlier Aleppo Codex. He made many changes to the <em>siddur</em>, which many follow, even if it's a change from the past. Why <strong>he</strong> made the change is another question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the masoretic tradition of Tiberias, a shewa under a <em>mem</em> which is preceded by a word-initial הַֽ־ with a gaʿya (meteg) is often pronounced naʿ. In many of these cases, the shewa is shown explicitly as a hatef patah in the Aleppo Codex. </p>\n\n<p>The word למנצח in Psalms 20 (or indeed, anywhere) does not have a ga`ya nor a hatef vowel under the lamed. Thus, there is no especial reason to pronounce the shewa as naʿ.</p>\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38509&hilite=649f60aa-81bb-4f16-818a-4f7b8bfa6bd2&st=%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%90&pgnum=74\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Diqduqe Hat-Teʿamim</a>, Yeivin's Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah section 347.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: Evidently is not clear to me what is being asked. I have shown that Artscroll is wrong as far as Tiberian Massorah is concerned. If the question is indeed still <em>why</em> they wrote the wrong thing, the answers could be human error, misunderstanding of the Tiberian rules, or perhaps they were following a grammar that did not follow Tiberian rules here. An example of such a book is this one:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FRA1G.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FRA1G.jpg\" alt=\"A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar: Second Edition\"></a></p>\n\n<p>(A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar: Second Edition)</p>\n\n<p>Here they assume that a shewa remains after degemination.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think there is anything more profound here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First of all, realize that there is some debate about this; the Tanach Simanim, for example, has a sheva nach on the word למנצח and the Tikkun Simanim has a sheva nach for similar examples (see, e.g., הַֽמְדַבֵּ֥ר in Genesis 45:12 but also many others). On the other hand, the Koren siuddur agrees with Artscroll.</p>\n\n<p>In general, if you take a word that starts with a non-guttural letter and aשוע נע, and then add the prefix ל with a patach, then the initial letter gets a dagesh hazak and the שוע נע remains. For nouns resulting from pi'el verbs* such as מנצח and מְדַבֵּ֥ר, the initial מ does not get a dagesh hazak; there is a debate about whether the sheva remains נע (Artscroll, Koren) or becomes נח (Simanim).</p>\n\n<p>*This also applies to nouns resulting from pu'al verbs.</p>\n\n<p>See Gesenius 20 m and 35 b.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the Na’arah claiming in a case where her husband truthfully accuses her of immorality?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Devarim 22:13-21 discuss a case in which a husband accuses his newlywed 12-12.5-year-old wife as having cheated on him in the period between Kiddushin and Nisuin, making her a married woman at the time and therefore liable to the death penalty. Most of the passage discusses if he’s lying, but v. 20-21 discuss what happens if he’s telling the truth:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאִם־אֱמֶ֣ת הָיָ֔ה הַדָּבָ֖ר הַזֶּ֑ה לֹא־נִמְצְא֥וּ בְתוּלִ֖ים לַֽנַּעֲרָֽה׃ וְהוֹצִ֨יאוּ אֶת־הַֽנַּעֲרָ֜ה אֶל־פֶּ֣תַח בֵּית־אָבִ֗יהָ וּסְקָלוּהָ֩ אַנְשֵׁ֨י עִירָ֤הּ בָּאֲבָנִים֙ וָמֵ֔תָה כִּֽי־עָשְׂתָ֤ה נְבָלָה֙ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לִזְנ֖וֹת בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑יהָ וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>If this matter is true - there were no signs of virginity for the girl - then they will bring the girl out to the entrance of her father’s house, and the people of the city will stone her with stones, and she will die, for she has done an atrocity in Israel to commit harlotry in her father’s house, and you will destroy the evil in your midst. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A cursory reading of these Pesukim would seem to indicate that we don’t ask the girl for an explanation, either before or after the evidence or lack thereof is brought out. Does this indicate that the courts indeed do not ask her for a defense? Does this entire case only apply if she pleads innocent, or if she pleads that she remains a virgin? Let’s say she claims that she was raped; does that get her off the hook if they don’t find any signs of virginity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Virgin_Maiden.3.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Na’arah Betulah 3:6</a> explains the passage as follows (based on oral tradition):</p>\n\n<p>The man accuses his new wife of committing adultery while she was betrothed to him <strong>and brings two witnesses who claim to have seen the adultery taking place</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The witnesses are interrogated and if the Beit Din is satisfied, she is executed.</p>\n\n<p>If her father brings witnesses who disqualify the husband’s witnesses as <em>eidim zomemin</em> then the woman is spared and the husband incurs lashes and a fine.</p>\n\n<p>If the husband brings a further set of witnesses to disqualify the father’s pair (<em>zomemei zomemin</em>) then the wife is once again sentenced to death.</p>\n\n\n",

How many lessons it would approximately take and what would be the cost of it?</p>\n\n<p>Any assistance and advice will be much appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your son will become a bar – mitzvah (congratulations!) – the real meaning is that now he will be responsible for keeping the mitzvos. He needs to be educated in the mitzvos and how he is going to keep them in your situation. </p>\n\n<p>The most desirable situation is that he should have someone experienced to teach him. As mentioned in the comments, the most likely help is going to come from Chabad. On <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/</a> there is a box entitled Chabad-Lubavitch Chabad Locator; try entering your location and see what happens. I for one would be most interested to know if this helps. (In the unlikely event that this does not help you could post another question entitled “Online preparation for Bar Mitzvah no help available”)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This may be an \"opinion-based\" question, so, I hope my suggestions, coming from an experienced Torah reader may assist.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, halachically, there is no requirement for a Bar Mitzvah to read any part of the Torah whatsoever. The party is also not a requirement. I mention this only as this may ease the stress of thinking that you <strong>must</strong> do any of this.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, yes, theoretically, one can learn from on-line resources, CDs, etc. However, after having taught lessons to a few kids previously and listening to several taught by others, I have to say, honestly, that some boys just can't \"make it\", no matter what. The Hebrew pronunciation is terribly off, and when one reads Torah and / or Haftarah, these are an absolute requirement. Pronunciation of each word musty be 100% accurate. (Yes, I know that there are various shuls that aren't finicky about this requirement, but, I will be blunt by saying that they are plainly wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>So, the first requirement is that your son can flawlessly read and pronounce the Hebrew words he will be reading. The next requirement is having a musical ear. He doesn't needa good voice, but an ear to accurately sing the appropriate trope (cantillation) notes required. Next, he needs a good memory, because the notes are not written in the Torah. Lastly, he needs discipline and patience. He must practice regularly at a regular schedule and keep at it. I've seen plenty of teenagers that are being pushed to read their Bar Mitzvah parsha, and they sound bad mainly because they haven't practiced enough, were never interested and motivated in the first place, and were forced to do this to make their parents \"proud\". My advice - If your kid puts up a tough fight against doing it, please don't force it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, assuming that all the above requirements are \"kosher\", I strongly recommend a personal tutor who will listen to your boy's performance, offer advice, feedback and constructive criticism. As I said, the Torah reading is a precise skill, and an online source will never give you the critical feedback.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this via Skype, etc. It's not the same as a personal meeting, but, I'd think it comes close.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this has been useful.</p>\n\n\n",

That is if indeed it’s the giants that were before and afterward? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Grammatically, it's a somewhat challenging passuk. However, the challenging part centers around the phrase אֲשֶׁר יָבֹאוּ, a third of the way through. The beginning is pretty straightforward: \"The Nephilim were in the land (or 'on the Earth') in those days and also afterwards...\" The grammar here isn't ambiguous. \"And also afterwards\" can only refer back to the Nephilim. You could end the passuk at that point and have a perfectly sound grammatical sentence.</p>\n<p>Also, if you look at the cantillation marks, which are grammatical markers, the main division in the sentence occurs after \"bore them.\" If \"and also afterwards\" referred to the B'nei Elohim, the division would naturally have occured at that point, but it doesn't.</p>\n<p>In terms of narrative, \"afterwards\" is necessary to foreshadow the post-diluvian existence of Nephilim as reported by the spies at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.14.15?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 13:33</a> (see Ibn Ezra) and/or the \"Anakim\" in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.33?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua 14:15</a> (see Radak). There is no further discussion of B'nei Elohim which would necessitate an \"afterwards,\" as their only other cameo appearance is in the Book of Job.</p>\n<p>As for the second part of your question, it does seem that the Nephilim are being linked to the Giborim (the \"Mighty Ones\"), since it says \"<em>these</em> are\" (הֵמָּה), a grammatical tool of referring back to the main subject of a sentence, in this case the Nephilim. This makes sense, since the passuk is best understood as describing how the Nephilim came into existence -- through a union of the B'nei Elohim and the daughters of men -- and then explaining to an audience that had heard of both \"Giborim\" and \"Nephilim\" that they are one and the same.</p>\n<p>The Torah does this in other places -- for example, in connection with the spies, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.3?vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&ven=The_Five_Books_of_Moses,_by_Everett_Fox._New_York,_Schocken_Books,_1995&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 13:3</a> states, וַיִּשְׁלַ֨ח אֹתָ֥ם מֹשֶׁ֛ה מִמִּדְבַּ֥ר פָּארָ֖ן ... אֲנָשִׁ֔ים רָאשֵׁ֥י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל <strong>הֵֽמָּה</strong>, \"And Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran ... heads of the Children of Israel <em>they were</em> (הֵמָּה).\" The use of הֵמָּה refers back to the <em>previous</em> passuk, a longer stretch than referring to the Nephilim in the beginning of the same passuk here. Similarly, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.8.16?vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 8:16</a>, הֵמָּה refers to the Levites discussed in the previous passuk.</p>\n<p>Part of the issue is that the translation you're relying upon is a poor translation, that drastically changes the order of the words and the sentence structure from Hebrew to English. Despite its idiosyncrasies, I prefer the Everett Fox translation (available on Sefaria), which almost always retains the original grammatical structure and often the precise word order. It is not the most \"beautiful\" translation, but in my opinion it is a great learning tool.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra offers four possible explanations. He explains Genesis 6, that (1) the b’nei haElohim are the children of nobles, (2) they were people of lofty character, (3) they were exalted descendants of Seth who married the inferior woman descended of Cain, or (4) they chose proper wives based on their knowledge of astrological planetary motion (ibn Ezra, like most contemporaries of his day relied on the efficacy of astrology). </p>\n\n<p>The sage, ibn Ezra then rejects that they were the “sons of G-d,” because that would imply that they were either angles or giants. He opts for the more likely approach that they were men high of stature (the common definition of giants in the Bible). </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding the teaching of a person who says \"I have labored in Torah study and haven't found success- don't believe him\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.6b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 6b</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר ר' יצחק אם יאמר לך אדם <strong>יגעתי ולא מצאתי אל תאמן</strong> לא יגעתי ומצאתי אל תאמן יגעתי ומצאתי תאמן <strong>הני מילי בדברי תורה</strong> אבל במשא ומתן סייעתא</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: If a person says to you \"<strong>I have labored and not found success,\" do not believe him</strong>. Similarly, if he says to you \"I have not labored but nevertheless I have found success,\" do not believe him. If, however, he says to you: I have labored and I have found success, believe him.<br />\n<strong>This applies to matters of Torah</strong>, but with regard to success in business- it all depends upon assistance from Heaven</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>3 scenarios are stated in this gemara:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>a)</strong> Labored and not found success -  <strong>DO NOT</strong> believe</li>\n<li><strong>b)</strong> Not labored and found success - <strong>DO NOT</strong> believe</li>\n<li><strong>c)</strong> Labored AND found success - <strong>DO</strong> believe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I understand how <strong>b)</strong> makes sense- a person who hasn't worked hard likely won't find success. I also understand how <strong>c)</strong> makes sense: a person who has labored and toiled over learning Torah will likely find success.</p>\n<p>It's <strong>a)</strong> that I'm having trouble understanding.</p>\n<p><strong>What does \"I have labored in Torah study and haven't found success- don't believe him\" mean?</strong> Does this mean the person <em><strong>really</strong></em> did find success in learning yet for whatever reason is not telling the truth about it? (why would someone say such a statement)</p>\n<p>How to make sense of this statement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>If you have laboured in תורה, that itself is success, you have had a successful life (day, week whatever). merriam-webster.com defines success as a \"favorable or desired outcome\". The mitzvah is לימוד התורה not ידיעת התורה. Furthermore חז\"ל tell us לפום צערא אגרא.\nSays the Kotzker: If you have toiled you have been successful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Normally we define success as having succeeded in what you set out to do. However with Torah we have a rule <em>nephesh amalah amalah lo</em> - If you learn one part of Torah the Torah can make itself understood to you in a different area. So you may not progress with the area you are grappling with, but you may be currently unaware that the light of the Torah has been revealed to you in a different area.</p>\n\n\n",

This all seems rather obvious. It seems to me like we don't need the Torah or Rashi or the gemara to explain to us why bribery is bad and will lead to improper judgements. It should have been sufficient for the Torah to say ״לא תקח שחד״ and leave it at that. So why does the Torah and subsequent commentaries elaborate to such an extent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains this in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9884/showrashi/true#v8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishpatim 23:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe will blind the clear sighted\n  and corrupt words that are right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>RASHI</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>You shall not accept a bribe:</strong> Even [in order] to judge fairly, and surely [not] to pervert the judgment, for [in fact, taking a bribe] in\n  order to pervert the judgment is already mentioned: “You shall not\n  pervert judgment” (Deut. 16:19). -[From Keth. 105a]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>for a bribe will blind the clear-sighted:</strong> Even if one is wise in Torah, and he accepts a bribe, he will eventually become deranged,\n  forget his studies, and lose his eyesight. -[From Keth. 105a,\n  Mechilta]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>and corrupt:</strong> Heb. וִיסַלֵף, as the Targum [Onkelos and Jonathan] renders: וּמְקַלְקֵל, [meaning] and spoils.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>words that are right:</strong> Heb. דִבְרֵי צַדִּיקִים, words that are just, true judgments, and so is its Aramaic translation: פִּתְגָמִין\n  ךְתְּרִיצִין, [meaning words that are] straight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that even if the judge is taking the present with the intention of judging correctly anyways, the very fact of accepting something will cause his <em>sight</em> to become twisted.

This type of case might not have been understood without the expansion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שחד related to שחט and שחת. From this relationship we get the basic\n  idea of its meaning \" to bring about the destruction of the spiritual\n  and moral force of life of somebody.\" Bribery kills the intellectual\n  and moral force of the one who receives it. The intellectual force\n  which makes a man fit to be a judge is called פקח, a clear open sight\n  for the right way to look at the facts, and the laws which apply to\n  them. The moral force is called צדק righteousness, which only\n  recognizes what is right, and which wishes to express nothing that is\n  not right. Bribery blinds the sight of one who otherwise sees clearly,\n  unconsciously prejudices his way of looking at the case and ויסלף וגו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bribery would make even an honest judge, who wishes nothing but what\n  is right and just, not as clear and firm and decisive as he should be\n  in giving expression to what is right. His sight becomes clouded, his\n  word faltering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is why the Bais Din must be paid by the community and not receive any money from any of the litigants.</p>\n\n\n",

How can Beit Shammai maintain that this is not a valid form of eating in a Succah, when the very elders of Beit Shammai made no objection to this practice?</p>\n<p>Beit Shammai rejects the proof because they disagree with the premise – according to Beit Shammai their elders did indeed object.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Some context must be provided to try to answer your question:</p>\n<p>Mishna 28b states: כל שבעת הימים אדם עושה סוכתו קבע וביתו עראי. The Rabbis further taught Baraisa 28b that states: ת”ר כל שבעת הימים אדם עושה סוכתו קבע וביתו עראי כיצד היו לו כלים נאים מעלן לסוכה מצעות נאות מעלן לסוכה אוכל ושותה ומטייל בסוכה.  Therefore, it can be deduced that according to Rabbis on 3b and Beis Hillel on 3a to make one’s sukkah קבע and to transform his house into עראי, he needs only to אוכל ושותה מטייל בסוכה, because in the end a person may not have elegant dishes or fine linens.  And, this requirement corresponds to Beis Hillel’s minimum size sukkah of ראשו ורובו, that a person must be able to literally fit his head and most of his body inside the sukkah in order to be able to fulfill the requirement to אוכל ושותה ומטייל בסוכה.</p>\n<p>However, Beis Shammai’s opinion adds to the common denominator of ראשו ורובו, in concluding that a person must literally pull his table out of his house, making his house עראי, and place the table inside his sukkah (ראשו ורובו <strong>ושולחנו</strong>) in order for him to אוכל ושותה מטייל בסוכה as he normally dwells in his house all year long.  And, the proof that Beis Shammai requires the table to be removed from his house is that Mishna 3a states: מי שהיה ראשו ורובו בסוכה ושולחנו בתוך הבית ב”ש פוסלין ובית הלל מכשירין.  Why does the Mishna state: ושולחנו <strong>בתוך הבית</strong>? Let the Mishna simply state that the table is outside the sukkah.</p>\n<p>Regarding the requirement to make one’s sukkah קבע, what are the rationales of the Tannaim?  In 28b, all hold that the Torah requires us to “תשבו” (dwell) in a permanent manner in a sukkah.  Therefore, a sukkah must be a “dwelling” and not like other structures such as a hut to merely sleep in or a watchtower from which to stand guard.  Rebbe holds that a sukkah needs to be a permanent dwelling like a house, which if built less than 4×4 amos will lose its ability to be a dwelling, similar to the Baraisa on 3b which explains regarding houses: דאי אית ביה ד’ אמות על ד’ אמות דיירי ביה אינשי ואי לא לא דיירי ביה אינשי.  Whereas, Beis Shammai holds that the unique feature of a dwelling is that a person eats meals at a table, otherwise it is not a dwelling but more like a hut, or some other type of structure.  However, Beis Hillel holds that if a person simply sat in the sukkah and ate from their hand it was enough to make it a valid dwelling, even without a physical aspect of קבע that would make it a דירת קבע structurally in a physical sense, as is found in the opinions of the Tannaim on 7b.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the argument between Rebbe, Rebbi Yehuda, Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel is regarding the nature of קבע that constitutes a dwelling within which one can fulfill the commandment to “תשבו”.  Beis Hillel uniquely makes his sukkah קבע through simply eating in the sukkah as opposed to his house, while at the same time maintaining that the physical structure of a sukkah requires a דירת עראי based on the words שבעת ימים, like Rava on 2a.</p>\n<p>לעולם בתרתי פליגי פליגי בסוכה קטנה ופליגי בסוכה גדולה וחסורי מיחסרא והכי קתני מי שהיה ראשו ורובו בסוכה ושולחנו בתוך הבית ב”ש אומרים לא יצא וב”ה אומרים יצא ושאינה מחזקת אלא כדי ראשו ורובו בלבד ב”ש פוסלין ובית הלל מכשירין</p>\n<p>The main issue of dispute in both a small and large sukkah is concerning whether a literal table is required inside the sukkah to qualify as a valid dwelling.  Consequently, regarding a small sukkah of ראשו ורובו the issue is not that the sukkah is approximately 6×6 tefachim, but that a sukkah of 6×6 tefachim necessarily does not permit Beis Shammai’s required table inside the sukkah from which a person must be able to eat.  Therefore, a sukkah that is too small is structurally invalid on a דאורייתא level according Beis Shammai, therefore ב”ש פוסלין.  Whereas, regarding the dispute in a large sukkah the issue is not that the table cannot physically fit inside the sukkah.  In this case, the sukkah itself is structurally valid according to the Torah, but since the table is not inside the sukkah from which one must eat their meals, the person does not discharge his דאורייתא obligation to dwell (תשבו) in a permanent manner, therefore ב”ש אומרים לא יצא to dwell in a sukkah.  This is because according to Beis Shammai the table is what makes it a dwelling.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Gemara is always referring to Beis Shammai’s requirement as an actual table which is required to be inside of the sukkah to be qualified as a dwelling, which tangentially reveals a minimum size for a sukkah as ראשו ורובו ושולחנו on a דאורייתא level.  The difference being not just semantics, but critical to the essence of the argument.  For, if a person always dwelt in a small sukkah without placing a table inside, Beis Shammai would say to them as they did to R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis on 28a: “In all your days you have never fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah”.  They did not state that he was dwelling in an invalid sukkah that was too small, but that they found him dwelling without a table.</p>\n<p>And this is the answer to confusion recorded in Mishna 28a between the students of Beis Hillel and the students of Beis Shammai. The students of Beis Hillel viewed the dispute only in terms of the size of the sukkah and found a proof in the fact that the Elders of Beis Shammai did not say a word to R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis about the small size of the sukkah which was ראשו ורובו.  And Beis Shammai said, a proof from that!  But, the elders of Beis Shammai said to him that if you have always eaten without your table inside the sukkah you have never fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah.</p>\n<p>Since Beis Hillel holds that a sukkah is a דירת עראי, which limits the height of a sukkah in accordance with שבעת ימים to 20 amos, it allows a sukkah as small as ראשו ורובו in regards to length.  Therefore, the students of Beis Hillel viewed the dispute between ראשו ורובו and ראשו ורובו ושולחנו in terms of a measurement of length.  And therefore, they found a proof that a sukkah is a דירת עראי from the fact that Elders of Beis Shammai did not say anything to R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis regarding the smallness of his sukkah.  Beis Shammai then discounted their proof and supported their own opinion that a sukkah is a דירת קבע in pointing out that while the Elders of Beis Shammai did not speak about the small size of R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis’ sukkah they strongly objected to his eating without a table.  Therefore, the Elders did object to the small size of R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis’ sukkah when rebuking him for not eating from his table.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In general we treat a maasei as weighty evidence of halakhah. See Shabat 21a; Bava Batra 83a. So after we state both opinions, the Gemara tries to prove who is right based on actual practice. (This raises an interesting side question of whether Beit Shammai actually followed shitat Beit Shammai, and if so why can't they always engineer a maasei in their favor, like Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai did in Rosh Hashana 29b). Furthermore, the initial version is a kashya on Beit Shammai because on the one hand they say a small sukkah is pasul, but on the other hand it appears their own rebbeim did not have any issue with the small sukkah of רבי יוחנן בן החורני. Finally, this maaseh may be especially important because רבי יוחנן בן החורני was a talmid of Shmmai HaZaken who himself was noheg like Beit Hillel. (See Yevamot 15b and the Tosefta from Sukkah brought there).</p>\n<p>As for the question asked in a comment about why we'd include this argument in the gemara it doesn't seem different from other kinds of shaklya v'tarya in the gemara. Beit Hillel tried to bring a proof of X, Beit Shammai rejected the proof by saying the story didn't happen like that. I don't see how it's any different from when the gemara has other hava aminas that it thinks are proof and then get rejectd. (You thought the mishnah was talking about X, but really it's talking about Y, so it's not a proof).</p>\n\n\n",

At least the line for him is not simple and clear cut (eg see discussion here: <a href=\"https://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/bereshit/kavet.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/bereshit/kavet.html</a>, where Rambam's reading of מה רבו מעשיך כלם בחכמה עשית is relevant).</p>\n\n<p>(If one takes this approach today - we have sciences of society, of the mind, of computers and so on. Science of weapons. One wants to distinguish between creation and destruction). </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, Character A wants to make a blessing, on understanding the profundity of what Greta Thunberg, the climate activist is saying and doing. Goes to the siddur. Says שנתן מחכמתו לבשר ודם. Lovely, but is this right? Why not שחלק מחכמתו ליראיו? I feel that the latter is more appropriate. Her work engages one's feelings about creation, in the sense of awe. </p>\n\n<p>But then am I naive in thinking that בראשית ברא is an awesome account of creation anyway? Rather than an anticipation of a fight over ארץ ישראל? Perhaps/of course how to read that is also contested. Perhaps, for some, this has more to do with נוח. </p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, where might I find my question, which is about which blessing to say, discussed? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם יאמר לך אדם: יש חכמה בגוים - תאמן... (ואם יאמר לך אדם) יש תורה\nבגוים - אל תאמן</p>\n<p>מדרש איכה רבה פרשה ב סימן יג</p>\n<p>If someone tells you there is wisdom among the nations - believe them. (If someone tells you) there is Torah among the nations - do not believe them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash draws the distinction between Torah and Chachma (wisdom), in that wisdom can be found among all the nations, but Torah is only found among the Jews. But how exactly is Torah defined such that we can says it is something that is found only among the Jews?</p>\n<p>A further question: Chazal say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם אין יראה אין חכמה</p>\n<p>משנה אבות ג יז</p>\n<p>If there is no fear, there is no wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We just said wisdom is something that can be found among the nations, how can we now say that wisdom cannot exist without fear? Are we to believe that all the scientists and thinkers of the world are G-d fearing people?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the following understanding can answer these questions:</p>\n<p>When Chazal say that if there is no fear, there is no wisdom - they are not necessarily referring to fear of G-d, but rather any fear. Wisdom is always an outgrowth of fear. In order to have something wise to say on any topic, one must be afraid of the repercussions of being wrong. In as much as someone is not afraid of being wrong, there is little motivation for them to think deeply or correctly. For scientists, this may come in the form of peer review of their work, or their fear of damaging their reputation, or their fear of failure. For businessmen, this may come in the form of fear of losing their money or missing out on big deals. In cases like these, Chazal say that you can trust their wisdom, provided that there is some fear behind it. (This is evident from the fact that Chazal will trust a non-Jewish chef to taste to see if a non-kosher ingredient has fallen into a pot of food, since he is afraid that his reputation is on the line if he gets it wrong.)</p>\n<p>When it comes to Torah, however, the motivating fear is fear of G-d. One's insight in Torah is only worth as much as they have fear that one day they will stand in front of their creator and have to justify their actions and their reasoning behind their decisions.</p>\n<p>Often secular wisdom is necessary in order to keep the Torah properly and make correct decisions. In these instances, one's learning the secular subject may be motivated by the fear of one day standing in front of G-d and needing to justify one's actions. In this case, that secular wisdom may be considered Torah in as much it is motivated by fear of G-d, like in the Rambam's case. Greta Thunberg, on the other hand, is likely not motivated by fear of G-d, but rather fear of climate change, which would put her squarely in the realm of Wisdom and not Torah.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one may develop insights in Torah, not based on fear of G-d, but rather because of fear of losing their reputation in the Jewish community. In this case, perhaps it would not be called Torah, but rather merely wisdom.</p>\n<p>According to this, the Bracha that you make on a Torah Scholar is particularly apropos: שחלק מחכמתו ליראיו</p>\n<p><strong>Torah is the wisdom which is an outgrowth of fear of G-d, as opposed to other wisdom which is the outgrowth of other fears.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

He is talking there about kiddush – the same should apply to the other cups at the seder. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובפסקי תשובות (מהדורת תשע\"א סי' רפט אות ג): \"ולמרות שכל הקידוש הוא\n  ברכת בורא פרי הגפן, מכל מקום דינו כברכת המצוות\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we do say a bracha on the mitzvah of four cups.

    "content": "# How to make oneself regret a sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As we know, regret is part of teshuvah. However, sometimes even though we understand logically that what we've done is wrong, we may not always sincerely regret it. In such case, two questions arise:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is teshuvah invalid if my regret is not sincere ( i.e. I understand what I've done is a sin but I just can't make myself sincerely regret it)?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there a way to make oneself sincerely regret a sin (realize the severity of the sin, etc)?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Great question!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding 1 - There is a rule (will add source, later - there are a few) that if one says \"I will sin and do teshuva then sin again\", the teshuva is ineffective. So, at the least, prior to doing to teshuva, one needs to realize the severity of the sin sufficiently to the point that he resolves not to repeat it. To me, that seems like he definition of \"regret\".</p>\n\n<p>Regarding 2 - There is no single clear way to do this. Each person's emotions, behavior and thinking is different. One way that I have heard from numerous people is this:</p>\n\n<p>One must imagine God as a benevolent father. (Not so ridiculous esp. when the term <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> is used so much during the High Holidays!) Your father would do anything whatsoever for you and expects the best behavior from you and loyalty to him in return. If God is your father, and you have sinned, essentially, you have been disloyal to him and disappointed him. You haven't lived up to his standards and his standards for you are placed in a way that is designed to benefit you and improve your life. It's for you; not for him. Wouldn't you think to yourself, \"How can I disappoint my father who has been so good and generous to me?\"</p>\n\n<p>Such is your relationship with God.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What makes a smart phone \"kosher\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have to admit that my phone is far smarter than me, and I am not \"with it\". So, I was surprised when a neighbor who is sending his kid to Israel told me that her kid needs a special \"kosher\" smart phone for use in his yeshiva.</p>\n\n<p>When my kids went to yeshiva, the rule seemed simple. They weren't allowed to bring the phone into class. If they used it, it was confiscated and the school reported that they misbehaved. Sounds simple, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, something happened in the past ten years, roughly, and yeshivot are requiring a \"kosher\" phone. What is that about? Does it mean no web access at all; accessing specific web sites? No games? No apps at all, it's only for calls?</p>\n\n<p>What makes this \"kosher\"? Is there a rav or Va'ad Harabanim certifying these phones? Are there different certifications? Who decides on the kashrut? Are there yeshivot or people that don't trust the kashrut of another smart phone? Are there specific brands or manufacturers that make such kosher phones? Do these cost more than other phones?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry that I'm seemingly overloading the questions. This is not a Purim type question. I'm really puzzled by all this. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Al explained what occurs in Israel. I'm curious what occurs in U.S. and other countries, as well. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 38)\n\n<p>A good question, let me outline the situation in Israel:</p>\n<p>20 years ago everyone used the same 2G Nokias, Sonys, etc. Some 15 years ago, with the latest developments in phone technology, namely SMS, cameras and Internet access a bold decision was made by religious (and political) leaders to make a clear distinction between \"us \"and they\" - as expressed in phones.</p>\n<p>The decree included two parts: 1. Phone must be from a certified source only (bought through Haredi channels from Haredi suppliers and dealers) 2. A phone must use a distinctive Kosher line starting with special digits (like 05272- or 05276- for Cellcom and 05484- for Partner). A deal was made that Kosher SIM cards (with Kosher numbers) were locked that they can be only used in Kosher phones.</p>\n<p>While the first part was logical and supportive, the second was strictly \"illegal\" as about the same time the Knesset approved two laws of cellphones that, strangely, didn't apply to Kosher phones (I'm not into politics, so I don't know exactly how they did it): 1. all cellphones on the market must be sold unlocked allowing the clients free and painless switch between cell companies and 2. a person owns the number and keeps it when switching companies.</p>\n<p>To enforce the order, all Haredi educational institutions from k-gardens to high Yeshivos were/are obligated to reject kids whose parents own non-Kosher phones (clearly seen by the phone numbers). Warning signs were put in all shuls and around the neighborhoods prohibiting entering with a smartphone (strangely the word iPhone (as the pioneer) was used almost exclusively for all smartphones, similarly to the Hebrew \"פלאפון\" used for all mobile phones, despite being the name of the first mobile provider) see <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%94%20%D7%A2%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9F&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1AOHY_enIL854IL855&sxsrf=ACYBGNTJ7UzbFqn0WvTsXZQredkwjC4pOQ:1568360821116&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi67fysp83kAhWtPOwKHaqtD00Q_AUIEigB&biw=1536&bih=772#imgrc=KezkR6xtVDQ08M:\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k4bsC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k4bsC.jpg\" alt=\"![warning sign in Hebrew about 'no-kosher' phones\" /></a></p>\n<p>The bright side of the deal was that Haredis became a major consumer group which allowed a steep reduction of the prices of Kosher cell plans (with no data of course), usually half of a regular plan (20NIS vs 50NIS). So within a year, all Haredi world switched to those Kosher phones and plans (me included).</p>\n<p>The problem began a year or two later when the same [poitical and economical] leaders felt the urgent need to switch to smartphones. That was unbearable, no Rabbi would allow that publicly, so the era of double-life begun - working Haredis bought two phones - one for work and one for their kid's school. The main problem, however, was the fact that smartphones had no filtering or protection whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Initially, people were ashamed of being seen with a non-Kosher smartphone in public, but eventually, it became a norm, so another solution was needed and it came very fast - a couple of Haredi companies started to offer special Koshered smartphones also (each for its community):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A regular Android phone (usually Samsung or LG) is rooted, disabling most of its internet functionality and Google services, especially Google Play (installing new apps) and sold for almost twice its price.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A dedicated Kosher app store is maintained by the company allowing the phone to use its apps exclusively. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%A8#%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A closed forum of people decides</a> on what apps are allowed to be used (that wreaks havoc, as SMSs are forbidden in Kosher 2G phones and WhatsApp is Kosher in Kosher smartphones).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The list of permitted apps differs between the companies, but usually includes the dialer, SMS, maps, Waze, WhatsApp, camera, banking, medicine, municipal services, e-siddurs and Jewish databases, tools and utils, etc. Many apps are banned just because of their use of [improper] ads.

    "content": "# \"Hanukkah 8th day/Tevet 3/New Years Day\" triple coincidences - What makes them so Rare?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I very recently became aware that Hanukkah 8th day sometimes (but rarely) falls on Tevet 3. What causes this to happen? At the same time, I also noticed that when Hanukkah 8th day/Tevet 3 happen together, this sometimes occurs in conjunction with the Gregorian New Year's Day (January 1). Additionally, when such triple coincidences occur, they always occur on the first day of the week (i.e. Sunday). One such \"triple occurrence\" happened most recently in 2017 (5777 Hebrew year). However, another one also occurred in 1797 (5557 Hebrew year), and yet another will apparently occur 150 years from now in the Gregorian year 2169 (5929 Hebrew year). So I now have a couple of related questions....</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1) Can someone tell me the calendar conditions that cause Hanukkah 8th day\n  to fall on Tevet 3? </p>\n  \n  <p>2) Can anyone possibly extrapolate from that to tell me how frequently it\n  might occur as a \"triple event\" with the Gregorian New Years Day? (I can only find two occurrences since the calendar shift from Julian to Gregorian happened in 1582). Thank you\n  for all of your help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>BONUS QUESTION</strong>: Hebcal seems to indicate that another triple occurrence also happened in the Gregorian year 1550. I highly doubt that this is correct because this date is prior to adoption of the Gregorian calendar when the all important \"11 day date shift\" occurred - that would make the triple occurrence in Gregorian year 1550 theoretically impossible. So, it doesn't seem to be correct. Is it possible that Hebcal is not calculating correctly? Can someone check this out? Does anyone know how reliable Hebcal is?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Edit/Update:</strong> I became more curious, so I manually checked the entire date range from Gregorian years 1797 to 3797 for any <strong>\"Hanukkah 8th\n  day/Tevet 3/January 1\"</strong> triple occurrences. This is what I found:</p>\n  \n  <p>I found a mere <strong>eight triple occurrences</strong> of \"Hanukkah 8th day/Tevet\n  3/January 1\" over the entire span of 2000 years - <strong>1797</strong>,\n  <strong>2017</strong>, <strong>2169</strong>, <em>2275</em>, <strong>2389</strong>, <strong>2609</strong>, <em>3486</em>, and <em>3706</em>. These 8 triple occurrences seemed to happen LESS frequently in future years\n  according to Hebcal with a large gap between 2609 and 3486. The dates in <strong>Bold</strong> all occurred on Sunday. The dates\n  in <em>Italics</em> all occurred on Friday. Furthermore, several of the dates appear\n  to be equally spaced by 220 years (except for 2017 to 2169 and 2609 to 3486).\n  I\n  did observe that the Hebrew dates do seem to be shifting gradually (slightly) relative to the Gregorian solar calendar. I do not know the reason for\n  this. I expected them to be continuous and relatively stable and in-sync. I also observed\n  that <strong>starting with the Gregorian year 3032, Hanukkah/Kislev 25 begins to fall</strong>\n  <strong>on January 1</strong> (after that such \"New Years Day/Kislev 25\" occurrences happen regularly).</p>\n  \n  <p>I suppose I may have missed one or two occurrences, but probably\n  not many. I wanted to post this update for any who might be interested in the date patterns. Thank you for your answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Answer to 1) - 3 Tevet is the latest date that 8th day Chanukah can occur. This means that both Chehsvan and Kislev are Chaser (deficient - having both 29 days), making the year itself a Chaser. I have to check the kevi'ot chart to see what days of the week Rosh Hashanna occurs for such keviyot.</p>\n\n<p>As for other criteria, either Jan. 1 or 2 are the latest dates for the last day of Chanukah. This would occur only in year 9 of the 19 year cycle.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On average the last day of Chanukah is on 3 Tevet about once every 4 years.

Will happen in 2020, 2023, 2029, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2043, 2047....)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding how often 3 Tevet is on January 1 and also the last day of Chanukah it never happened in the 20th century. In 1914, 1933, 1952, 1998 the third of Tevet was on January 1, however it was the day after Chanukah.</p>\n\n<p>The last day of Chanukah comes out as late as January 3.

    "content": "# Why cannot a convert make certain statements? I feel they are being pushed away at the same time respect is being given to them\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is stated that a convert is in the same regard considered a Jew as a native born. Rashi on Dvarim 26:11 states that a convert cannot recite the declaration כי באתי אל הארץ נשמע ה׳ לאבתינו לתת לנו. Why is that? At conversion a convert receives a Jewish neshama, thus making him part of the Jewish nation, a Jew in every respect. Rabbi Manis Friedman said in a shiur that the reason a converts needs to convert is exactly for the reason of becoming a Jew in every regard. When he receives a Jewish neshama now he is 100% a Jew, and he can say \"our fathers\" etc.\nHere is part of the shiur: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZMX7Y7ava0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZMX7Y7ava0</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>You're absolutely right to compare this statement to saying \"our fathers\" in tefillah.  The mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bikkurim.1.4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bikkurim 1:4</a> makes the same comparison and rules that a convert can't say either one.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_First_Fruits_and_other_Gifts_to_Priests_Outside_the_Sanctuary.4.3?p2=Kessef_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_First_Fruits_and_other_Gifts_to_Priests_Outside_the_Sanctuary.4.3.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">We don't pasken like that mishnah</a>.  Instead, we follow <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.3b.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehuda, quoted in a braisa in the Yerushalmi</a>, who rules that a convert does say \"our fathers\" in Shemoneh Esrei and will be able to say mikra bikkurim as soon as we have the Beis Hamikdash operating properly.</p>\n\n<p>I also disagree with the premise of your question.  Everyone agrees that converts are fully Jewish, but there are certain statements that converts can't make.  For instance, a convert can't say \"I am not a convert\" or \"I am a biological descendant of Avraham\".  The question is how closely the word \"our fathers\" is tied to biological descent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Rambam allowed a convert to say “God of our fathers” in prayers, which a convert was, up to that point, not allowed to say, because his “fathers” were not Jewish.  Indeed, the Mishna in Bikkurim does not allow it.  [The Babylonian Talmud (the Bavli) has no Gemara in Bikkurim]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The convert brings [first fruits] but does not recite [the relevant declaration in Deuteronomy] because he cannot say “the land which God has sworn to our fathers to give us.” [Deuteronomy 26:3].  But if his mother was of Israel, he may [both] bring [first fruits] and recite [the declaration].  And when he prays by himself, he says, “God of the fathers of Israel”.  And when he is in synagogue [with the community], he says, “God of YOUR fathers.” But if his mother was of Israel, he says, “God of our fathers.” [B. Bikkurim 1:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the Jerusalem Talmud (the Yerushalmi) allows it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A… convert brings [first fruits] AND recites [the declaration in Deuteronomy].  Why?  [Because God said to Abraham]:  “For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” [Genesis 17:5]. In the past you were a father to Aram [only], but now, henceforth, you are a father to all the nations. [J. Bikkurim 1:4, 64a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maimonides ruled in favor of the Yerushalmi.  In his letter to a convert named Obadiah, he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You ask me if you, too, are allowed to say… “Our God and God of our fathers”, “who has sanctified us through His commandments”, “who has separated us”, “who has chosen us”, “who has given to our fathers to inherit [a pleasant, good and spacious land]”, “who has brought us out of the Land of Egypt”, “who has worked miracles to our fathers”, and more of this kind.  Yes, you may say all this in the prescribed order and not change it in the least…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And he concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Toward father and mother we are commanded to honor and revere them, toward the prophets to obey them, but toward converts we are commanded to have great love in our inmost hearts.... God, in His glory, loves a convert --... [because he is] a man who left his father and birthplace and the realm of his people at a time when they are powerful, who understood with his insight, and who attached himself to this nation which today is a despised people, the slave of rulers, and recognized and knew that their religion is true and righteous... and pursued God... and entered beneath the wings of the Divine Presence...  [Letter to Obadiah the Convert]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The debate continued.  It took four centuries, but the Rambam’s position is now universally accepted. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If you read from the beginning of chapter 26, it is understood that the subject being discussed is primarily about inheritance of the land of Israel. That follows tribal association.</p>\n\n<p>This concept in halacha follows what was decided by the court of Moshe Rabbeinu as recorded in the five books of Moshe. Male converts do not have any tribal affiliation and therefore do not have at present any inheritance in the land. That is the meaning of Rashi’s comment which you cite.</p>\n\n<p>Male converts relate to a higher aspect of the Jewish people which is also alluded to in the same posuk you cite (Devarim 26:11). Namely that they correspond to the innermost aspect of the Jew, also referred to as the <em>Pinteleh Yid</em> or as mentioned in Tanya, the חלק אלקא ממעל ממש.</p>\n\n<p>This aspect corresponds to the whole of the Jewish people (the concept of <em>Tzibbur</em>) which is why, according to some, a male convert is permitted to refer to their connection to the Avot who are the source of the entire nation.</p>\n\n<p>This is also why ultimately male converts will receive an inheritance in the land of Israel which will be donated by all the tribes. The male converts will comprise what is referred to as the 13th tribe.</p>\n\n<p>This concept of 13 also relates to the 13 aspects of mercy, and the level of teshuva connected with Ne’ilah of Yom Kippur, meaning conversion in an inclusive sense.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the name Mekom P'tur indicative of being entirely permissible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the introduction to Tractate Shabbat in his Commentary to the Mishnah, Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל מקום פטור מותר להוציא ממנו לכל אחת משלש הרשיות ומהן אליו וזה מותר לכתחלה ולפיכך נקרא מקום פטור</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kafih</a> translation)</p>\n<p>But a <em>mekom p'tur</em> it is permissible to take out from it to any one of the [other] three domains, and from them to it, and this is permissible <em>ab initio</em> and therefore it is called \"a place of exemption\".</p>\n<p>(My translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Rambam tells us that the reason for the name <em>mekom p'tur</em> – place of exemption – is that carrying to and from that domain is entirely permissible. However, this seems to be a puzzling reason to give the domain this name. In the area of Shabbat, the term \"exempt\" (<em>patur</em>) usually carries the implication that the perpetrator is merely exempt, but <em>not</em> that the act is entirely permissible:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=3&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat 3a</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאמר שמואל כל פטורי דשבת פטור אבל אסור בר מהני תלת דפטור ומותר צידת צבי וצידת נחש ומפיס מורסא</p>\n<p>did not Samuel say: Everything [taught as] involving no liability on the Sabbath, involves [indeed] no liability, yet it is forbidden, save these three, which involve no liability and are [also] permitted: [viz.,] the capture of a deer,  the capture of a snake, and the manipulation of an abscess?</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_3.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that the connotation of \"exempt\" is expressly <em>not</em> \"entirely permissible\", why would this domain be named \"a place of exemption\" specifically to illustrate that it <em>is</em> entirely permissible?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The context leaves no doubt to indicate complete exemption as the use of <em>Petur</em> is relative to a Rabbinic enactment. The source of <em>Makom Petur</em> is Shabbos 7b which is talking about a specifically rabbinical forbidden to carry area called a <em>Carmelis</em>. Anything not within the parameters of a Rabbinic <em>Carmelis</em> is a place of rabbinic exemption (which means the rabbis had no concerns and allowed it) as there is no rabbinic enactment of <em>carmelis</em></p>\n\n<p>אין כרמלית למעלה מי' ואקילו בה רבנן מקולי רה\"י ומקולי רה\"ר מקולי רה\"י דאי איכא מקום ארבעה הוא דהויא כרמלית ואי לא מקום פטור בעלמא הוא מקולי רה\"ר דעד י' טפחים הוא דהויא כרמלי' למעלה מי' טפחים לא הויא כרמלי'</p>\n\n<p>Shmuel (Shabbos 3a) is talking about non-indicative uses of <em>Patur</em> when refering to Petur as still being forbidden. He does not deny the word means \"exempt\" and could therefore mean exempt from Rabbinical prohibition (i.e permitted) if absolutetly clear from context. </p>\n\n\n",

Moshe ibn Chaviv, who points out that Yechezkel states that gerim will get a portion in Eretz Yisrael in Moshiach’s times; therefore they can well say לתת לנו in future tense. (A logical reason for this is that gerim who joined the Jewish people after Yetzias Mitzrayim, when we were at the highest heights, may not have been totally sincere; not so with those who became gerim during the years of galus.) Whereas אשר נתת לנו is in past tense.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of mefarshim on Rambam bring an idea from R. Shmuel Primo, that the expression ארץ זבת חלב ודבש is never found in Chumash Bereishis (addressed to the Avos), only in Shemos (addressed to the Jews in Egypt) and afterwards. So if in וידוי מעשר the expression כאשר נשבעת לאבותינו refers to ארץ זבת חלב ודבש, then אבותינו there necessarily means the Jews who were in Egypt – and the ger isn’t descended from them.</p>\n\n<p>Yet another answer, from Mirkeves Hamishneh, is that מקרא ביכורים must be said in lashon hakodesh, and there אבותינו can mean “masters” (as in וישימני לאב לפרעה); whereas וידוי מעשר can be said in any language, and in other languages “av” means only “father.”</p>\n\n\n",

A heavenly voice (bas kol) then announced, “Rabbi Eliezer Ben Durdiah is to be taken to life in the World to Come”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I have followed the story right, it seems like the crying is part of his penitence, which results in “Rabbi Eliezer Ben Durdiah is to be taken to life in the World to Come”, which is seemingly a very good omen for him.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Tosafos (Kesubos ad loc.) notes how the phrase ‘one is to be taken to life in the World to Come’ always indicates that it is done so without a judgement and without suffering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מזומן לחיי העולם הבא - תימה והלא כל ישראל יש להם חלק לעוה\"ב ופירש הרב ר' מאיר כל היכא דאמר מזומן לחיי העולם הבא היינו בלא דין ובלא יסורין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, how is the statement that it is a bad omen to die from weeping to be explained in light of this tale. Does it apply only sometimes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps the manner in which he died indicates that he not only repented in theory but also in practice. That is, he rectified the area in which he had sinned. The Talmud (Kesubos 103a) must be explained in its own way; likewise, the weeping here must be understood in its own context. The Talmud is clearly offering a situation wherein one dies amidst either jest or wail. Under those terms, jest means a good omen, etc.</p>\n<p>In the incident with Rebbi Elazar Ben Durdiah, it is clear that he has not been placed under those above-mentioned pretenses. His crying is only an accompaniment to the main event: the position of the head between his legs. According to a passage in the Aryeh Kaplan commentary on <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> (p. 37), this itself is very significant, especially with regards to sexuality, which as the Talmud (Avodah Zarah 17a) taught, was the chief offense of Rebbi Elizer Ben Durdiah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The covenant of circumcision also represents the channeling of sexual energy. The sexual drive is one of the most powerful psychological forces in man, and when it is channeled along spiritual lines, it can help bring one to the highest mystical states. In giving the commandment of circumcision, God indicated that the emotions and desires associated with sex could be used for the mystical quest of the Divine on a transcendental plane.</p>\n<p>The juxtaposition between the \"circumcision of the tongue\" and the \"circumcision of the membrum\" explains the prophetic position favored by Elijah. The scripture states, \"Elijah went up to the top of the Carmel, entranced himself on the ground, and placed his face between his knees\" (1 Kings 18:42). This position was used for the intense concentration of spiritual energy. According to the Midrash, this position was used because it placed the head in conjunction with the mark of circumcision.</p>\n<p>When one is in this position, all of these forces are brought together. The ten fingers. ten toes, tongue and sexual organ comprise a total of 22 elements, paralleling the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.The individual's body itself thus becomes an alphabet, with which he can \"write\" in the spiritual realm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the true depth of these Kabbalistic teachings is unknown to me, according to this passage it seems that Rebbi Eliezer Ben Durdiah may have achieved a high level of meditation. Furthermore, it appears that this meditation directly served as the greatest form of repentance available to him amidst his moment of plight. This is indeed similar to the interpretation offered by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ben_Yehoyada_on_Avodah_Zarah.17a.8?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada</a>.\nI believe the \"seven waters\" which Ben Durdiah crossed in order to reach the prostitute may have certain significance in light of his subsequent repentance in the area of circumcision; see further in Kaplan's <em>Sefer Yetzira</em> (cf. p. 188).</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to have begun only after the 2nd Temple existed. Between the two Temples, from what I'm reading, it was common for Jews to pray and hear public Torah readings in the market place.</p>\n\n<p>I'm assuming that one of the main motives for building a synagogue was to have a house of prayer available to supplement the temple (while it existed) for those who could not get to the Temple itself to offer sacrifices and pray, there. Moreso, when the Temple did not exist, the prayers substituted for the sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that during the period between the 1st and 2nd Temples, it seemed that a building was not necessary. Why is that? Or, rather, what changed during the 2nd Temple period that made people build actual structures vs. praying in the market place?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are many synagogues known to have existed in the Second Temple period both from literature and archaeology (see lists on <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99_%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA_%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_synagogues_in_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English</a> Wikipedia). So the question isn't whether they existed, but more what purpose they served. This subject is addressed in Ezra Fleischer's article <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23598311\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"On the Beginnings of Obligatory Jewish Prayer\"</a> (in Hebrew), specifically pp. 402-414.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize his argument, synagogues weren't used for public prayer during the Second Temple period. בית כנסת (like its Greek counterpart <em>sunagogē</em>) means \"house of gathering,\" not \"house of prayer.\" What took place in synagogues is adduced from contemporary sources, which never mention public prayer in a synagogue. In fact, the structure of synagogues that have been discovered seems to indicate places for sitting on all four sides of the building (whereas a house of prayer would more likely have all seats facing the Temple or the ark).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, contemporary sources do mention it as a place for gathering and reading from the Torah. To mention a few of them: An <a href=\"https://www.kchanson.com/ANCDOCS/greek/theodotus.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">inscription</a> on one Israeli synagogue says that Theodotus \"built this synagogue for reading the Torah and learning the commandments.\" Philo (<a href=\"http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book25.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Life of Moses 2.215-216</a>) describes the houses of prayer of his own day (in Alexandria) as \"schools of wisdom.\" The gospels and the Acts of the Apostles portray Israeli and diaspora synagogues as a place in which the Torah was read and where Jesus and Paul tried to teach. Reading from the Torah in the synagogue has survived until this day as part of the public prayer, but in those days it wasn't part of public prayer, it was the main purpose of the gathering in the synagogue, while prayer was individual.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why synagogues became places for public prayer is because public prayer was standardized after the destruction of the Second Temple by Rabban Gamli'el. The standard prayer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/89154/1569\">seems to have been composed</a> at this time, along with the practice to say prayers communally. Due to the need to pray with ten people, prayers became part of the synagogue.</p>\n\n\n",

Such confession is a positive commandment. How is the verbal confession made? The sinner says: \"I beseech Thee, O Great Name! I have sinned; I have been obstinate; I have committed profanity against Thee, particularly in doing thus and such. Now, behold! I have repented and am ashamed of my actions; forever will I not relapse into this thing again.\" This is the essence form of <em>teshuvah</em>;</strong> but whosoever elaborates in confessing and extends this subject is, indeed, praise-worthy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this in mind (and since he can't verbalize it) is it possible for a mute person to do teshuva?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Quoting the Rambam again, he actually says something more radical. \"כְּשֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה תְּשׁוּבָה וְיָשׁוּב מֵחֶטְאוֹ חַיָּב לְהִתְוַדּוֹת -- ... when he does teshuvah, he is obligated to confess...\"</p>\n\n<p>The mitzvah is vidui (the confession), teshuvah is the context in which vidui would be said.</p>\n\n<p>There is a dispute among acharonim as to whether the Rambam counts among the 613 mitzvos anything that is purely thought. This is part of a wider question about how we can be commanded to think or feel a certain way. The free will involved is certainly different; in the moment, we have very little control over what we believe or feel. It takes weeks to years of preliminary work to be in the right place in the moment.</p>\n\n<p>In either case, Briskers believe that the Rambam does not count mitzvos of thought. R YB Soloveitchik in particular points to this Rambam as one example where he recasts the \"maaseh mitzvah\" to be an action, saying vidui, even though the chalos, the state-change we intend the mitzvah to cause, is in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>So, it would seem to me that a deaf person cannot do the mitzvah of vidui.</p>\n\n<p>As to whether they can do teshuvah...</p>\n\n<p>Many a Shabbos Shuvah sermon invokes the case of a man who says \"Behold you are wedded to me on the condition that I am righteous.\" The gemara rules (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.49b.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Qiddushin 49b</a>) that even if he was [until then] a rasha gamar (totally wicked person), the marriage is binding. Because he could have had hirhurei teshuvah -- thoughts of repentance. And if so, the condition would be met.</p>\n\n<p>(By which the gemara means means, binding enough to require a gett. If they want to remain married, we would still require a second wedding, because maybe he didn't have that thought. The whole thing is in a safeiq [maybe] state.)</p>\n\n<p>The Alter of Slabodka, and those many rabbis in their sermons, note that even a thought of teshuvah can successfully clean the slate of even the most wicked.</p>\n\n<p>So, it would seem that as long as a person can think, they can do teshuvah.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <em>sefer</em> <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=601485&width=0&scroll=0&udid=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>LeDofkei BaTeshuva</strong></a> by <strong>Rabbi Uri Teegar</strong> on <strong>Rambam</strong>'s <em>Hilchos Teshuva</em> 1:1, in <em>Biurim</em> <em>s.v.</em> על לשון כל ישראל (near § 65, it's too far to see for free on Otzar HaChochma) brings the <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.364.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§ 364</a>, who explains the reasons for <em>vidui</em> (verbal confession): (1) expressing one's sins reveals one's thoughts and beliefs, such that it's clear they don't think their sin went unnoticed by Hashem. As well, (2) through expressing it they'll regret their actions more and will refrain from transgressing again. Although a person can have regret even without verbalizing it, explicit <em>vidui</em> will make a stronger impression.</p>\n\n<p>The former brings from the <em>sefer</em> <strong>Hirhurei Teshuvah</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em> § 5 that according to the first reason of the <strong>Chinuch</strong>, someone who is mute, their lack of verbalizing the <em>vidui</em> shouldn't detract from their thoughts. It's just that someone who could speak and doesn't will be lacking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LeDofkei BaTeshuva</strong> suggests that even according to the second reason, since the mute person can't speak, we shouldn't say that verbalizing in order to make an impression is מעכב/inhibitive.</p>\n\n<p>He also brings (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=601485&width=0&scroll=0&udid=0&pagenum=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</a> ad. loc.</em> § 143, 144, 146, 150 - 153, 156) those who say a person's atonement is completely dependent on verbal expression of <em>vidui</em>, and without it their <em>teshuva</em> wasn't effective (<strong>Minchas Chinuch</strong> 364:1). However, if they were <em>shogeg</em>/accidentally negligent or <em>oness</em>/without fault, their <em>teshuva</em> should be effective (<strong>Derech HaMelech</strong> <em>ad. loc. peirush he'aruch</em> § 2, not like the <strong>Minchas Chinuch</strong>. <strong>Rav Chaim Kanievsky</strong> <em>shlita</em> in the margin comments: \"ודאי\"). Based on this, it would seem someone who is mute, who is clearly an <em>oness</em>, would be fine.</p>\n\n<p>However, the person needs to think the entire <em>vidui</em> text as they would have verbally (<strong>LeTeshuvas HaShana</strong> p. 106. <strong>Rav Chaim Kanievsky</strong> in the margin comments: \"יפה\").</p>\n\n<p>Some go further that if any person performed <em>teshuva</em> in their heart and didn't verbally express <em>vidui</em>, it's still considered <em>teshuva</em> (<strong>Yad Ketana</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em> § 6. <strong>Minchas Chinuch</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> seems to concur in the end), and they receive atonement (<strong>Shu\"t Beis Avi</strong> 2:53). It's just that they didn't fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>vidui</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Others say that <em>teshuva</em> and <em>vidui</em> of the heart is enough, (<strong>Shu\"t Lev Chaim</strong> 1:10, 3:136. <strong>Beis Elokim</strong> <em>Sha'ar HaTefilah</em> Chapter 12. <strong>Imros Tehoros</strong> Chapter 5), just it's better to express <em>vidui</em> verbally.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are those who say that if a person's <em>teshuva</em> was sincere and complete, then the <em>vidui</em> isn't inhibitive (<strong>Shu\"t Mishneh Sachir</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> 162:1). As Micha Berger pointed out, immediately once a person thinks in <em>teshuva</em> they considered like they're completely righteous, regardless of their atonement status (<strong>Minchas Chinuch</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> <strong>Koach HaTeshuva</strong> 11:2 points out that this is already explicit in <strong>Ohr Zaruah</strong> 1:112).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above author and Rav Chaim Kanievsky both stressed that their presentations of the different opinions are entirely their own and should not be relied upon. A person should always consult their local Orthodox Rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

We see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/2590/cities-of-refuge-when-moshiach-comes\">here</a> that the Levites will reclaim the cities of refuge.

Yet they do not belong to any tribe that has landholdings. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we currently classify converts (or at least their children) as \"Yisrael\", but that will no longer be an option. </p>\n\n<p>Are there any sources that speak of these two groups in the messianic era?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As far as gerim, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.47.22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 47:22-23</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָיָ֗ה תַּפִּ֣לוּ אוֹתָהּ֮ בְּנַחֲלָה֒ לָכֶ֗ם וּלְהַגֵּרִים֙ הַגָּרִ֣ים בְּתוֹכְכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־הוֹלִ֥דוּ בָנִ֖ים בְּתֽוֹכְכֶ֑ם וְהָי֣וּ לָכֶ֗ם כְּאֶזְרָח֙ בִּבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אִתְּכֶם֙ יִפְּל֣וּ בְנַחֲלָ֔ה בְּת֖וֹךְ שִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל: וְהָיָ֣ה בַשֵּׁ֔בֶט אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥ר הַגֵּ֖ר אִתּ֑וֹ שָׁ֚ם תִּתְּנ֣וּ נַחֲלָת֔וֹ</p>\n<p>You shall allot it as a heritage for yourselves and for the strangers who reside among you, who have begotten children among you.

Standard halachic opinion is that sacrifices away from the Temple were forbidden.

See the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904993/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Nine.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Yesodei HaTora 9:3</a> where he says that Eliyahu was acting under the command of Hashem to bring a sacrifice on a private altar while the Temple was in existence even though this was ordinarily forbidden.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Similarly, a prophet who violated his own prophetic instructions, and\n  one who refrains from prophesying, are liable for death at the hand of\n  God, since concerning the three of them, it is said, \"I will seek\n  [retribution] from him.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>When a prophet - who has already proven himself to be a prophet -\n  instructs us to violate one of the mitzvot of the Torah or many\n  mitzvot, whether they be of a severe or light nature, for a limited\n  amount of time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages of the early generation taught as part of the oral\n  tradition: If a prophet tells you to violate the precepts of the Torah\n  as Elijah did on Mount Carmel, listen to him with regard to all things\n  except the worship of false gods. This applies when his command is\n  temporary in nature.</p>\n  \n  <p>For example, on Mount Carmel, Elijah offered a sacrifice outside [the\n  Temple's premises], even though Jerusalem was chosen for such\n  [service], and one who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple's\n  premises] is liable for karet. Since he was [already established as] a\n  prophet, it was a mitzvah to listen to him. The commandment, \"Listen\n  to him,\" applies in these circumstances as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>If they would have asked Elijah: How can we violate the Torah's\n  command [Deuteronomy 12:13]: \"[Be careful...] lest you offer your\n  burnt offerings everywhere\"?, he would have told them: We should not\n  say anything, but anyone who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple\n  premises] is liable for karet, as Moses said. [The present instance,]\n  however, [is an exception]. I am offering a sacrifice today outside\n  [the Temple] at God's command in order to disprove the prophets of\n  Ba'al.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, if any [other] prophet commands us to transgress for a\n  limited time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him. If, however, he says\n  that the mitzvah has been nullified forever, he is liable for\n  execution by strangulation, for the Torah has told us: \"[It is] for us\n  and our children forever.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chullin 5a</a>) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לימא מסייע ליה והעורבים מביאים לו לחם ובשר בבקר ולחם ובשר בערב ואמר רב יהודה אמר רב מבי טבחי דאחאב על פי הדבור שאני </p>\n  \n  <p>Can we say that the following supports his [R. ‘Anan's] view? It is written: And the ravens\n  brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening, and Rab Judah\n  explained this in the name of Rab that [the ravens brought the flesh] from Ahab's slaughterers! —\n  Being a Divine command it is different.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Chullin.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R.

Anan's view by noting that Elijah seemed to have acted in accordance with it, by eating meat slaughtered by Ahab's slaughterers. The Talmud rejects this support, though, because it's possible that R. Anan is really wrong, and the meat in that case would actually have been forbidden, but Elijah was able to eat it anyway because God told him to.</p>\n\n<p>According to this rejection, we have here an example of God telling (or at least allowing) a prophet to break a law.</p>\n\n\n",

However, if a person eats poison, even if the eating was unintentional he will certainly get injured and die from it. The same is true by forbidden eating, for it sullies the heart and soul and is like poison for the soul. Therefore, even if done unintentionally and even though there is no punishment from the prohibition, but the soul is damaged like by poison. And therefore God saves him from this.

    "content": "# Why is turning on a faucet not considered molid or boneh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As has been discussed in many questions on this site, halachic authorities generally agree that the use of electricity is prohibited on Shabbat, but some differ in their analysis of <em>why</em>.  (There is general agreement that turning on incandescent lights violates the prohibition against heating metal until it glows, but for other uses of electricity the reasons are less clear.) In particular, some authorities hold that turning on an electrical appliance violates the prohibition against <em>molid</em> (creating something new) or <em>boneh</em> (building).  (See, for example, <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/broyde_1.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/broyde_1.htm</a>, Section II, Paragraphs A and B.)</p>\n\n<p>Do any of the authorities who hold that turning an appliance on violates <em>molid</em> or <em>boneh</em> offer an explanation of what, exactly, distinguishes (say) turning on an electric fan from opening a faucet and using running water?  Everyone (I think) agrees that the latter is permitted, but it would seem to me that the two situations are quite analogous.  Opening a tap renders a previously useless set of pipes into a source of flowing water, just as closing a circuit renders a useless set of wires into a functional wire.  I'm wondering whether anybody has addressed the specific question of why one is permitted while the other is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong> Just to clarify, I am <em>not</em> asking whether the authorities who hold that closing a circuit constitutes <em>molid</em> or <em>boneh</em> are correct.  I know there are others who disagree with this (and indeed the article I linked to in the first paragraph discusses this at length).  I want to know whether any of those who <em>do</em> hold this way have explained why the same argument does not apply to opening a faucet.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Pipes under your sink -even water is not flowing through them- is still a fully functional pipe (כלי), just as a cup without liquid in it is still a cup. But a broken circuit is just that a \"broken\" circuit, and when you close it you are \"fixing\" it, hence the issur of boneh etc.</p>\n\n\n",

I understand completely, that the Baraitah is a part of a series of statements starting with \"Everybody/Everything...\" but that alone seems to be a bad reason to group Halachic topics <em>if one wants to understand the Halachah</em> as opposed to merely memorizing it. (<em>This method of arranging discussion By-The-Way is worth a question on its own</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The Beraytah was clearly known to the editors of the Talmud, and nevertheless, they decided to put it in Erchin and not Succah (there's also a viable option of copying the passage several times).</p>\n\n<p>Please help me to find a reasonable explanation of how the placement of this Beraytah in Erchin instead of Succah <em>helps to understand</em> the topic of sitting in Succah?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Please: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do not comment \"<em>that's the way they did it back then</em>\" as we hold the Talmud eternal. </p></li>\n<li><p>Do not comment \"<em>there are tens of other examples</em>\" as it does not help in the understanding of the phenomenon</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not comment \"the purpose of learning Torah is to merely engage in reading/murmuring Talmudic passages\", as this question exclusively addresses the goal of <strong>understanding</strong> the Halachah</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not comment \"it proves one should be proficient in the whole Sha\"S\" as it is just a huge drawback caused by a decision to scatter the subjects over the Talmud</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Midrash (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37460&st=&pgnum=215\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohellet Rabbah Parshah 1</a>) states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לטובתו אדם למד תורה ושוכח שאילו היה אדם למד תורה ולא שכחה היה מתעסק בתורה שתים שלש שנים וחוזר ומתעסק במלאכתו ולא היה משגיח בה לעולם כל ימיו אלא מתוך שאדם למד תורה ושוכחה אינו מזיז ואינו מזיע את עצמו מדברי תורה</p>\n<p>It is for his benefit that man learns Torah and forgets.

Someone might decide that he wants to become an expert in Succah and might therefore only learn Masechet Succah. This would cause large parts of Torah to be abandoned.</p>\n<p>By spreading out the topic over various tractates, even someone who only wants to learn about Succah will be forced to learn other things as well in order to cover all the Succah content.</p>\n\n\n",

Maybe he was incredibly hurt!</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> The Rambam says that after the 3rd apology:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"the person asking to be forgiven need not pursue the matter any further\"  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this mean that even though his friend refuses to forgive him, Hashem forgives him anyway?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The sin in not forgiving is <strong>refusing to act the way God does</strong>.  The summary of God’s 13 attributes is that God is merciful.  This is why this passage is repeated many times in the Yom Kippur liturgy.  The Talmud says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All who act mercifully [that is, forgivingly] toward their fellow creatures will be treated mercifully by Heaven, and all who do not act mercifully toward their fellow creatures will not be treated mercifully by Heaven.  [Shabbat 151b; also RH 17a; Meg. 28a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The doctrine of “Imitation of God” states that we must emulate God’s 13 attributes.  The Talmud says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[God]…showed Moses the order of prayer. He said to him: Whenever Israel sin, let them carry out this service before Me and I will forgive them. [Rosh HaShanah 17b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commentators note that God does not say “SAY” these words and I will forgive you, (<em>Yomru kaseder hazeh</em>); but “FULFILL” these words and I will forgive you (<em>Ya'asu kaseder hazeh</em>).  This is interpreted to mean:  If you want God’s forgiveness, become more forgiving yourself.  Likewise, Rav Nahman of Breslov said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you imitate God by being compassionate and forgiving, He will in turn have compassion on you, and pardon your offenses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Another opinion is that they argued specifically about a 4x4 amma sukka.</p>\n<p>A story is brought as a question on these two opinions, and the gemara comes to the conclusion that according to these opinions, Rabbi Yehuda must have thought that a woman and her seven sons sat in a too-small-for-its-height (and therefore passul) sukka.</p>\n<p>Rashi says, there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ורבי יהודה סבר כו'</strong>: וא\"ת לרב חנן דמוקי פלוגתא בשאינה מחזקת אלא כדי ראשו ורובו שולחנו הכא כיון דבניה גבה הויא לה גדולה ומודו בה רבנן ומאי ראיה של רבי יהודה? י\"ל דשולחנה בתוך הסוכה הגדולה היתה ובניה על מקום השולחן היו יושבין ראשן ורובן ולא כמסובין הן אלא כזקופין. ולי נראה דודאי לרב חנן קשיא והאי תירוצא לרב הונא הוא וכן עיקר ששיעור ראשו ורובו ושלוחנו אמרינן לקמן דאינו אלא ז' טפחים ואי אפשר לשבעה בנים בשבעה טפחים.</p>\n<p><strong>And Rabbi Yehuda thought</strong>: If you say that according to Rav Chanan, who holds that their argument is only in a sukka that holds just his head, the majority of his body, and his table, here, since her sons are with her, it must have been a big (enough) sukka, and chachamim agree with rabbi Yehuda (in this case), so what is rabbi Yehuda's proof? We can say that her table was in the big (outer) sukka, and her sons sat with their head and the majority of their bodies where the table was supposed to be, and they weren't leaning, rather they were upright. However, I think they this is still a question on Rav Chanan, and this answer is only brought for Rav Huna (who holds that the argument is in a 4x4 amma sukka). This is more correct, because as we see later, the length of a head, the majority of the body and his table is only 7 tefach, and seven boys do not fit in 7 tefach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosafos on the other hand, says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>לא נצרכא אלא לקיטוניות שבה</strong>: מה שדחק הקונטרס לרב חנן בר רבה מה ראיה לרבי יהודה הא אי אפשר לשבעה בנים בשבעה טפחים לאו פירכא היא דדילמא ארוכה טובא אבל לא היתה רחבה [אלא] שבעה טפחים ובניה באותו אורך הוו יתבי</p>\n<p><strong>No, it is needed for its small rooms</strong>: what Rashi thought was problematic according to Rav Chanan bar Rabbah, in that there is no proof for Rabbi Yehuda because seven sons cannot be in seven tefachim, is not a problem, because maybe it was much longer (than seven tefachim), but it wasn't [was only] seven tefachim wide, and her sons would sit along the length.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(All punctuation and parentheses are mine, the brackets are what the Ta\"z and Magen Avraham said should be added to the Tosafos)</p>\n<p>We see here that Rashi didn't want to say that the passul sukka was long on one end but too short on the other, presumably because he holds that then it would no longer be passul (because it no longer fulfills the requirements of being 7x7 to be problematic that it's above 20 ammos, because it's total area is above 49 tefachim). Similarly, any sukka that is at least 49 square tefach would seemingly be allowed according to rashi (unrelated to the discussion about the height).</p>\n<p>Tosafos, on the other hand, (without the brackets) seems to hold that a sukka that is too long on one side but too short on the other would still be passul. <em>However</em> it's only passul because it's above 20 ammos tall (seeing as Rabbi Yehuda still allows it), <em>not</em> because one side is under 7 tefach. Which means that this version of Tosafos would <em>also</em> hold that as long as it has an area of 49 square tefach, it's a kosher sukka.</p>\n<p>According to the other version of Tosafos (with the brackets), even when one side is longer than 7 tefach,if the other is 7 tefach it's still passul (because it's over 20 ammos tall). This shows that the minimum lengths are absolute, and are not just guides to get the desired area. Therefore, in general, if one side of a sukka is less than 7 tefach, no matter the length of the other side, the sukka would be passul.</p>\n<p>This also means that הש\"י quoted as taking about a sukka which is less than 7 tefach by more than 7 tefach is probably taking about Rashi and referencing this Rashi.</p>\n<p>Also, the Ta\"z quoted in the OP as saying that 1x49 tefachim is allowed, must hold that way even though he thinks it's a machlokes Rashi tosafos, seeing as his version of Tosafos (with the brackets) would hold that 1x49 isn't allowed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems to be based on the discussion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sukkah.7b.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 7b - 8a</a> which analyzes R.

If so, is Moshe relaying punishments that God may have relayed to him, previously, but were not written or relayed the first time? If so, why were they left for the later version and not mentioned, earlier?</p>\n\n<p>Or, is Moshe analyzing / deriving some of these punishments based on his own thinking or analysis?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar addresses this question, as well as why here the curses are in the singular, whereas in Bechukosai they’re in the plural. After addressing why in Bechukosai they’re specifically 49, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וקודם הערבות נאמר ואם לא תשמעו בלשון רבים לומר דווקא שאם כולם סג יחדיו נאלחו אז הם ראוין לאותן מכות כוללות אבל הצדיק אשר בתוכם הוא את נפשו ימלט, אבל כאן אחר הערבות כל אחד יסבול עונו ועון חבירו על כן באו במספר צ\"ח כפול כנגד עונו ועון חבירו, ונאמר והיה אם לא תשמע. בלשון יחיד והמכות כלליות לומר לך שאפילו יחיד החוטא מסבב קללה אל הכלל, כמ\"ש (דברים כט יז–כא) פן יש בכם איש או אשה וכו', וכתיב וראו את מכות הארץ. ש\"מ שרבים ישאו עון היחיד כמו שהיה במעשה של עכן (יהושע ז) לכך נאמר ואם לא תשמע. שאפילו יחיד שלא ישמע גורם מכות לרבים והם המכות הכלליות הנזכרים בפרשה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially he says that in between Bechukosai and Ki Savo, they accepted responsibility for each other; therefore, in Bechukosai, only if they sin as a community will they be punished, whereas in Ki Savo even if an individual sins, others will be punished on his account. Therefore the number of curses is doubled, to indicate that one is being punished for his own sins as well as his friend’s. </p>\n\n<p>(This doesn’t fully answer your question, as it doesn’t address where these curses come from, but it does address why there are so many more.)</p>\n\n\n",

We do use Art Scroll (regular size) machzorim for High Holidays. I use the large print one as I am Shaliach Tzibbur. It definitely is missing some English translation of some prayers, and it is a bit heavy.

I'm qualifiying \"necessary\" strictly in terms of what you really need to have in your home to do \"daily activities\" and immediate reference for certain things.</p>\n\n<p>One necessary book that you did not mention is a siddur. Unless you have memorized everything, I assume that you will be bentching at home and someone will be davening at home at some point. (Even if you never miss a single minyan, your wife or kids will probably daven at home.) </p>\n\n<p>Supplemental to that, you should have a few benchers / zemirot booklets for yourself and a few extras for guests. Don't buy these, though. If you attend enough simchot, you'll have enough. If not, ask a shul or a friend for some extras. Someone is bound to have a few to spare.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch / Mishna Brurah - Hmmm. Probably good to have. But maybe not a necessity in the home. Depends what you really need to look up quickly. Perhaps, a more focused book like <em>Shemirat Shabbat</em> if you need to quickly find out in English an answer like, \"Can I brush snow off my walkway on Shabbat?\" Shulchan Aruch won't really get you a simple answer to these \"modern\" questions.</p>\n\n<p>There are similar books more focused on Shabbat cooking such as The Shabbat Kitchen (There's a series in these works focused on different aspects of Shabbat). In my opinion, many Jews, including myself, don't know the minutiae of what's permitted and forbidden on Shabbat, because the laws are really complex. And Shabbat is an essential part of Jewish life, so you need to know.</p>\n\n<p>Gemarot / Mishnah are not home necessities in my opinion, unless you plan to regularly study at home. If you are a shiur / Daf Yomi or chevruta attender, you'll find these in a Bet Midrash. (Personally, even when studying alone, I prefer to study Gemarra in a Bet Midrash. Besides less distractions, inevitably, Gemarra study requires supplemental commentaries and resources which I will likely find in a Bet Midrash.)</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Tana\"ch includes \"Chumash\". An Art Scroll / Koren, etc. Tanac\"h will have the Chumash in it, obviously. You don't need both, unles you want some portability in carrying that Chumash to shul. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Artscroll Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (which includes references to the Mishna Berura and Igros Moshe where appropriate) is, in my opinion, an important work to have in your library. </p>\n\n\n",

I know it starts soon.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>First of all congratulations for wanting to grow in your Jewish learning. Learning Talmud means different things. <strong>One approach</strong> is to learn the structure of the Talmud, its way of approaching issues, the various elements of logic it uses, key elements of language (the Talmud is written in Aramaic). This is best accomplished by picking a few pages and learning them in depth, with the goal of progressing towards one chapter then a full tractate. Beginners typically start with topics such as the time to recite prayers or lost and found objects, i.e., topics of practical interest. The rabbi who you learn with will likely offer his own suggestion or some options to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't own a Talmud, it is likely the rabbi you will learn with will provide you with a copy of the tractate you will learn from. Artscroll has a <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/trt.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">travel edition</a> of their English translation of the Talmud, with all tractates broken down over a number of small and light brochures, which are relatively cheap and provide much depth for further study. They also exist as an <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artscroll-digital-library/id536661409\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iPad</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/APP.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Android</a> application and you can purchase part of a tractate only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The other approach</strong> is to learn the content of the entire Talmud, and indeed someone who learns all of it will have incredible breadth across many Jewish topics. However this can take very long (<em>daf yomi</em> takes seven years) and, unless you are familiar in advance with the topics, can be a frustrating experience. Not to discourage you but learning <em>daf yomi</em> requires much persistence and time commitment (30-40 minutes a day minimum if you want to follow along with a shiur, closer to 60 minutes in many cases). I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner. Before learning <em>daf yomi</em> you might want to start by learning all the <em>mishna</em> (which is the foundation of the Talmud) to get a grounding in the content. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/101242/11501\">here</a> for resources to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations again and feel free to ask more questions as you progress in your learning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Adding to what <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/108496/11486\">mbloch</a> said,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would you recommend the Daf Yomi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. A beginner would not be able to keep up with the pace of learning one entire daf every day. Even those who are well-versed in the Talmud would agree that this kind of learning is somewhat \"superficial\". You will not be able to fully understand every concept brought forth from Chazal rushing through each daf, especially as a beginner. I would recommend learning one perek at a time, at your own pace, and since you're just starting out I'd pick a relatively \"easy\" masechta. Most students just starting out learn either Perek Eilu Metzios in Bava Metzia or Perek Tefillas Hashachar in Brachos. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I am a <em>baal teshuva</em> so I have had this issue before.</p>\n\n<p>I would 100% recommend against starting with daf yomi: it’s way too hard, and it takes years of preparation to get to that level.</p>\n\n<p>I would recommend that you buy tractate Bava Metzia of the Artscroll Talmud, and study the second chapter, “elu metzios”, which deals with lost articles. By studying this chapter, you will learn most of the basic words. Be prepared for it to take months or even an entire year before you move on from the first daf, because it does take time.</p>\n\n<p>I would also recommend that you find a rabbi, teacher, or friend to study with — someone who already knows how to learn Talmud.</p>\n\n\n",

In this way, there may be no single point in time at which the original is 'dead' and the copy is 'alive' - or at least no line that can be drawn unambiguously.</p>\n\n<p>What would halacha say about it? Would it consider it as murder, since the original is disassembled? Or maybe it'd be ok since the person is recreated elsewhere and continues to live there, and moreover from a subjective viewpoint it would feel like a continuous experience - not unlike going to sleep on an airplane and waking up in another country.</p>\n\n\n",

Converting that Truth into a rule of behavior, a halachic ruling, is much like casting a shadow. So, you could have multiple correct rulings.</p>\n\n<p>The need to \"cast a shadow\" isn't because of halakhah, but because of the gap between Divrei E-lokim Chaim and the world we're trying to apply it to. Like the 3D cube and the 2D wall. But, like the shadow, we are fully using the entire cube to know which shadow is appropriate for this light and this wall. Or, without the metaphor, we are fully using the Torah to decide which pesaq to use given this person's perspective and the realia he is facing.</p>\n\n<p>Another situation is like the wall being at a different angle relative to the light and the cube.

It functions as a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are used to maintain quality standards, improve performance, and provide credibility. (WIKI)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I noticed, the main tendency of Jewish methodology is that a statement is uttered and left unaddressed (unresearched) for many years and only the later generations start questioning and finding possible explanations. For example, in the Gemmorah Amorayim try to explain the sayings of the Tannoyim (some 100-200-500 years later), Geonim try to explain the Gemmora, then Rishonim, then Achronim, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I'd expect that Rabbis that are interested in finding the ultimate G-dly truth would share their thought with their peers to validate and verify their findings or maybe disprove and discard.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an idea of \"peer-review\" in Judaism? Did any Rabbi/movement in the past establish a system of submitting a work to a close examination to other Rabbis?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Some of the disagreements in earlier answers seem to stem from different understandings of peer review.  From the definition stated in the question, it seems totally reasonable to think of disagreements in the mishna and gemarah, or in the rishonim, achronim, and later works, as constituting peer review.  Those who disagree are typically \"people with similar competences\", and are, in some sense, \"evaluating\" the work of others.  Functionally, machloksim sometimes motivate different sides to refine their original opinions, or even occasionally retract them.  In this sense, I think it's reasonable to answer \"yes\" to the question.</p>\n\n<p>But for those who are familiar with peer review from their experience in the world of scholarly research and publication, the definition is likely unsatisfactory, and these people will probably be inclined to say, no, there is no real and effective peer review in typical rabbinic literature, not in the talmud, nor later.</p>\n\n<p>In conventional scholarly communities, when someone has a good idea they try to write it down as best as they can, clearly stating their main idea, bringing as much possible evidence for it, hoping to convince other scholars that their ideas are original, interesting, and compelling.  They then send off their manuscript to a journal, and editors of the journal send the manuscript to other experts in the relevant particular field to evaluate.  If someone does potentially ground-breaking work in treating chronic myeloid leukaemia, for example, the editor won't send their work to just any general doctor, or even to a general oncologist, or even to a general research oncologist, but instead will send it to someone in a very specialized subfield who is qualified to evaluate that particular idea.  Multiple such referees will review the paper and provide recommendations to the editor (who is usually not a specialist in this particular area) about the quality of the submission.  Maybe the idea is terrible, or maybe it's a brilliant, but has already been developed by others.  Or maybe it's original, interesting, and overall compelling, but can be improved in various ways.  The peer-review process functions to reduce the number of bad papers published, and to improve the quality of the ones that are published.   </p>\n\n<p>In this sense, of course rabbinic literature is not peer-reviewed.  Sure, R' Meir and R' Yehuda, the Rambam and the Raavad, or the Ktzose and Nesivose might regularly disagree, but that's not what members of functioning scholarly communities normally think of as peer-review.  And yes, journals like Hakirah, Tradition, The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society, The Torah Umadda Journal, etc. use some kind of peer-review, but neither the talmud, nor the geonim, rishonim, achronim, nor most contemporary lamdanim and poskim, do anything remotely similar.  Instead, the vast bulk of what's published is self-published (i.e., if I can raise enough money to print my chiddushim on X, then some seforim press will take my money and publish what I wrote, irrespective of whether it's excellent or terrible), or else is published by kollel's, yeshivas, etc, who typically publish almost everything submitted.  Like your high-school student newspaper.  </p>\n\n<p>So, the answer to the question then, I think, depends on what is meant by peer review.  If all is meant is that we allow for some room for disagreement, then sure, it's peer reviewed!  But if by the term we have in mind a particular rigorous process that helps ensure (but of course doesn't guarantee!) the quality of what's published, then I think the answer is unfortunately no. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Just being published in the Talmud is a form of Peer Review. Not everything that Rabbi Akiva ever said has been written & published, only the things that his peers felt were valuable. And everyone who publishes a Sefer gets an Haskamah / approbation from their mentors & peers. Jews have been practicing peer review for millennia.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>More than 50% of mishnayos have multiple tanaim disagreeing.  That's peer review.  R' Meir says something, R' Yehuda reviews it and says something else.  When nobody disagrees explicitly, the assumption is they reviewed it and agreed (הלכה כסתם משנה).</p>\n\n<p>It's exactly the same in the Gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why use bee honey on Rosh Hashana?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The honey in \"land of milk and honey\" is date honey (I believe), and yet most people use bee honey on Rosh Hashana. Does it matter what kind of honey you use at all? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Levush [O”Ch 583] honey is a custom of Ashkenaz.  Apparently, when the custom developed, date honey was not available.  In fact, since dates are one of the symbolic foods for Rosh Hashana [Krisus 6a] it is possible that the custom of eating honey was a substitute for dates. \nSome explain bee honey as symbolizing turning the harshness of last year into the sweetness of this year, based on, “and from vigor came sweetness.” [Shoftim 14:14].\nOn a similar note, Leket Yosher [O”Ch] states that bee honey is actually preferable.  Bees represent judgment, as they sometimes sting out of vengeance.  Yet, they produce sweet honey.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the Day of Judgment will result in sweetness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Reisman is quoted as answering the question <a href=\"http://60secondspark.weebly.com/weekly-spark/category/rosh-hashana\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Yisroel Reisman (Ki Savo 5775) offers a beautiful insight which\n  provides a brilliant perspective for life. Date honey generally\n  doesn’t take much effort to obtain, as the sweet nectar often flows\n  out of the fruit and coats each one with a sweet and sticky outer\n  layer. On the other hand, bee honey is only attained through a lot of\n  work and pain as the stinger-wielding swarm angrily defends their\n  natural candy. Consequently, when we ask Hashem for a sweet new year,\n  the easily acquired date honey is not the model example. Although we\n  may be most comfortable with an easy-going pleasant year, a truly\n  sweet and successful life comes with deep determination and personal\n  sacrifice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, if he didn’t do that, and now he needs more money for a mitzvah, he would have to use his savings up to the amount he would’ve had if he’d set it aside all the years.

Here's a short recap:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>R' Eliezer had an argument with some Chachamim, and R' Yehoshua was the greatest of them regarding ritual purity of a special sort of an oven... eventually...</em><br>\n  ... A Divine Voice emerged from Heaven and said: Why are you differing with Rabbi Eliezer, as the Halakha is in accordance with his opinion in every place that he expresses an opinion!</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yehoshua stood on his feet and [disagreed with the Voice and] said: It is written: “It is not in heaven”, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In continuation of my question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/108514/eilu-veilu-from-heaven-who-said-it-applies-to-every-rabbi\">does eilu-veilu-apply-to-every-rabbi</a>\", why didn't the Heavenly Voice admit that R\"Y and all Chachamim's opinion is also a legitimate one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the ultimate truth of Heaven, the חכמת אלקים, Rabbi Eliezer was correct. However ultimate truth isn't given to us, Torah is. The truth on earth differs from the truth in heaven because we do not have the capacity to understand that much. Heaven can only pasken according to the ultimate truth, so Heaven could not pasken: ''eilu v'eilu\" as that is not the ultimate truth, that is the truth on earth.</p>\n\n<p>This is based upon the teachings of Rabbi Moshe Schapira זצ''ל on the י''ג עיקרים.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The fact that un-anointed and un-appointed Sages, Rabbinim openly stated that they were taking the power of Hashem to themselves and creating their own unending additions, removing and creating new laws answers many statements in Torah. Also, in Eruvin 21b, the Rabbinim explained to their student of the fact that Hashem's law and commandments were punitive while the laws of the Sages resulted in the violator to be boiled in excrement.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the Talmudic response was that Hashem related that His children had beaten Him. This seems that men of finite wisdom decided to become gods and create the second Rabbinical Judaism Oral Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Eruvin 21b:7-11</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.21b.7-11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.21b.7-11?lang=bi</a></p>\n\n<p>אמר ליה וכי תורה פעמים פעמים ניתנה אלא הללו מדברי תורה והללו מדברי סופרים </p>\n\n<p>Rav Ḥisda said to him: This cannot be so, for was the Torah given on two separate occasions, i.e., were the more lenient and more stringent mitzvot given separately? Rather, these, the old, are mitzvot from the Torah, and these, the new, are from the Sages. </p>\n\n<p>דרש רבא מאי דכתיב ויותר מהמה בני הזהר עשות ספרים הרבה וגו׳ בני הזהר בדברי סופרים יותר מדברי תורה שדברי תורה יש בהן עשה ולא תעשה ודברי סופרים כל העובר על דברי סופרים חייב מיתה </p>\n\n<p>Rava expounded another verse in a similar fashion: What is the meaning of that which is written: “And more than these, my son, be careful: of making many books [sefarim] there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12)? My son, be careful to fulfill the words of the Sages [soferim] even more than the words of the Torah. For the words of the Torah include positive and negative commandments, and even with regard to the negative commandments, the violation of many of them is punishable only by lashes. Whereas with respect to the words of the Sages, anyone who transgresses the words of the Sages is liable to receive the death penalty, as it is stated: “And whoever breaches through a hedge, a snake shall bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8), taking hedges to refer metaphorically to decrees. </p>\n\n<p>שמא תאמר אם יש בהן ממש מפני מה לא נכתבו אמר קרא עשות ספרים הרבה אין קץ </p>\n\n<p>Lest you say: If the words of the Sages are of substance and have such great importance, why were they not written in the Torah, therefore, the verse states: “Of making many books there is no end,” </p>\n\n\n",

Therefore it is true to say that the Halakhah is not about the truth, it is all about engaging in Torah study - that's all that matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet we almost never see poskim say \"Here is one possibility\" or \"This is just one of many true statements that can be made\". Instead it's usually something like \"This appears to be the <em>correct</em> way\", or \"This is the <em>right</em> interpretation [of the Torah]\", or even \"The other Rabbi/posek is incorrect/mistaken because of xyz, clearly this is the right approach\". Sometimes this latter statement is even made in strong worded language, decrying the other opinion(s).</p>\n\n<p>If halachic authorities subscribed to this Eilu v'eilu view - i.e. that it's not about finding <strong>the</strong> truth, but only about the process of sincere Torah study, and that all the outcomes of this process count as true - they wouldn't express themselves as if they were seeking some actual truth or \"<em>the</em> Torah way\" that existed 'out there' independently, or that was correct to the exclusion of others. And they certainly wouldn't become impassioned about the opinions of other authorities because they perceive them to be wrong. (There is no such thing as a 'wrong' opinion in this eilu v'eilu view, as long as it was arrived at sincerely)</p>\n\n<p>So do halachic authorities in practice not believe in this form of eilu veilu?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't have an explicit source for this, but the following understanding of truth, when it comes to halacha and decision making, seems to me to be consistent with the way it was understood by Chazal:</p>\n\n<p>Any one statement (statement B) can be comparably more true than another statement (statement A) by taking into account all the factors contributing to statement A, plus at least one additional factor.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement A: You should bring an umbrella today, because the weather forecast says it will rain.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement B: You should not bring an umbrella today, because although the weather forecast says it will rain today, You will not be outside at all.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Statement B is more true than statement A since it incorporates all considerations of statement A, plus an additional factor (that they are not going outside at all)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement C: You should still bring an umbrella today because despite the fact that you will be inside today, the roof leaks significantly.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Statement C is more true than statement B (and statement A) since it incorporates an additional factor (the leaky roof). Note that this is the case even though both statement A and Statement C have the same conclusion, statement A is still less true since it only arrived at that conclusion coincidentally. <strong>This is because truth is defined not by the conclusion, but by the web of factors contributing to the conclusion.</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to this we can understand a number of important concepts:</p>\n\n<p>1) Ultimate truth exists only at infinity- as it would involve taking into account an infinite web of considerations. We may only increase the truth of our statements, but their is not necessarily an endpoint. </p>\n\n<p>2) The truth of any one statement can be compared to another. This is why often you may see a posek view their opinion as more true than another, since they believe they have considered all the considerations of the other opinion and added an additional consideration, making their opinion definitively more true.</p>\n\n<p>3)The concept of Eilu v'Eilu, (although <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/2017/parsha/rsch_shoftim.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some</a> interpret it in a more benign way) stems from the inability of humans to be perfect logicians. Sometimes we have considerations that we are not able to articulate effectively. Because of this you may end up with a situation where you have two opinions each of which take into account an additional factor that the other does not. Now, if they would be able to communicate effectively with each other they would each be able to accommodate both factors and come to an agreement, but until they do that there is no clearly defined opinion that is more true than the other. As long as they were both trying to reach the highest level of truth that they could, they are equally accepted by Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I saw a very interesting Maran haChida recently. See Petach einayim Bava Metzia 72a D\"H \"אם\" -  light is found only in place of darkness, truth is found only in a place where there are lies. In every halacha, until we hear an opposite saying, the halacha cannot be established. And with the help of the refuted opinion the truth could be built up.\nAlso, A refuted opinion can also hold true in a slightly different situation.</p>\n<p>(Rough translation)</p>\n<p>In Masechet Chagigah too see the Ran Drush 3 where he says  that all contradicting opinions where brought down from heaven by Moshe Rabbeinu without a psak to the contradictions and the rulings would be according to the rabbis of each generations.</p>\n\n\n",

Normally if one tanna would disagree with the majority of tannaim, his view would be rejected.

Here are some representative quotes (extracted from R Baruch Frydman-Kohl's Teshuvah: <a href=\"https://www.beth-tzedec.org/page/writings-from-the-rabbis/a/display/s/1/item/teshuvah-non-jews-in-synagogue-choirs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Non-Jews in Synagogue Choirs</a>)</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.ccarnet.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CCAR</a> Responsa Committee, the Reform's movement central rabbinical body</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The phenomenon of non-Jewish choristers is on its way out. It\n  represents a phase of Reform history which no longer can serve as\n  precedent for our teshuvah. <strong>The shelichei tsibbur must be members of\n  the covenant community and they cannot yield this responsibility to\n  outsiders</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (Conservative)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unanimous opinion of the Committee that the practice of having\n  non-Jews in synagogue choirs is not in keeping with Jewish standards\n  (1954). Gentile choir leaders at services are deemed contrary to the\n  spirit of Jewish tradition and practice, although there would be no\n  objection to using them in training a choir (1958)... Remarkably, for\n  a Committee that prizes diversity and often exhibits disagreement,\n  this decision has been reviewed four times with the same conclusion:\n  <strong>choristers must be Jews</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.beth-tzedec.org/page/writings-from-the-rabbis/a/display/s/1/item/teshuvah-non-jews-in-synagogue-choirs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the original</a> for more history, details and the author's personal conclusions.</p>\n\n\n",

Are the remnant referenced to as only some of the Jewish people?  </p>\n\n<p>Why would Hashem not want all of the Jewish people to return to His Torah and Eretz Yisroel? Had the majority of the Hebrew people done something evil or contrary to Hashem and His Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Welcome Arnold and it's a good question with many possible responses.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional Jewish teaching is that the Prophets of the Tanach are prophecies that relate to each and every generation. So how the words apply to a given generation, hundreds or thousands of years ago, would be different from our lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>But in the current context, if you look from the beginning of the chapter, it appears to be addressing the Holocaust and the massacre of the Jewish people by the Nazis. The <em>remnant</em> are those who physically survive that process.</p>\n\n<p>In various Jewish writings, like Sefer Avkat Rochel of Rabbeinu Makir ben Abba Mori, book 1, sign 1-4, it refers to this time period, which is the beginning of the process of the final redemption as the <em>Pekidah</em> which is alluded to in Isaiah 10:3 and also 10:12. For whatever reason (something we cannot truly understand), G-d's wisdom decreed that it would begin in this way.</p>\n\n<p>There are some who wish to relate this to the Jewish concept of <em>Reward and Punishment for the nation of Israel</em>, but there is another traditional view in Judaism that this decree, which seems to be directed toward the Jewish people, transcends that system and is simply something G-d required <strong><em>according to His wisdom, which is not like our wisdom</em></strong>, as part of the final redemption. That it is really more of an assessment of how the nations of the world relate to the Jewish people, who G-d loves and cherishes, not a measure of the merit of the Jewish people themselves. This association to the re-establishment of the Monarchy of the House of David is alluded to in Isaiah 10:5 and also 10:24 which mentions the <em>rod and staff</em>, which are symbols of the Monarchy of the House of King David.</p>\n\n<p>This time period is also referred to in the Talmud and other places as <em>the Heels of Moshiach</em>, and is a period when the Jewish people suffer greatly.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning your last question, G-d wants all the Jewish people, in every generation, to return to His Torah and <em>to the land</em> which is an allusion to His will. And in fact, that is also G-d's promise through his Prophets. That every Jew will be included in the final redemption because like it says in Isaiah 60:21, they are all righteous in G-d's eyes. And this relates to our belief in the ultimate resurrection of the dead. Not a single Jew will ultimately be left out or forgotten like is found in Tanna D'vei Eliyahu and Pesikta Rabbati and elsewhere discussing when Moshiach ben David accepts his mission from G-d to bring about the final redemption.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yeshayahu is talking about the Jews that are left over from the destruction that he prophesies will come, as he says in (10:1-3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה֥וֹי הַחֹֽקְקִ֖ים חִקְקֵי־אָ֑וֶן וּֽמְכַתְּבִ֥ים עָמָ֖ל כִּתֵּֽבוּ׃\n  לְהַטּ֤וֹת מִדִּין֙ דַּלִּ֔ים וְלִגְזֹ֕ל מִשְׁפַּ֖ט עֲנִיֵּ֣י עַמִּ֑י לִהְי֤וֹת אַלְמָנוֹת֙ שְׁלָלָ֔ם וְאֶת־יְתוֹמִ֖ים יָבֹֽזּוּ׃\n  וּמַֽה־תַּעֲשׂוּ֙ לְי֣וֹם פְּקֻדָּ֔ה וּלְשׁוֹאָ֖ה מִמֶּרְחָ֣ק תָּב֑וֹא עַל־מִי֙ תָּנ֣וּסוּ לְעֶזְרָ֔ה וְאָ֥נָה תַעַזְב֖וּ כְּבוֹדְכֶֽם׃\n  בִּלְתִּ֤י כָרַע֙ תַּ֣חַת אַסִּ֔יר וְתַ֥חַת הֲרוּגִ֖ים יִפֹּ֑לוּ בְּכָל־זֹאת֙ לֹא־שָׁ֣ב אַפּ֔וֹ וְע֖וֹד יָד֥וֹ נְטוּיָֽה׃ (ס)</p>\n  \n  <p>Ha!

Abaye retorted: You too inflict punishment and kill.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like you should channel your natural proclivities towards something permissible. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I asked my Rabbi Z\"L a similar question many years ago: assuming one's Middos are the tools that G-d provides, should one make use of it or overcome it, as we saw from Avraham's Akedah example. </p>\n\n<p>The answer was that there are two levels of Avodas Hashem - on a lower level one makes use of the Middos - if he loves violence he could be a Shochet or an executor, as you mentioned. On a higher level, he should overcome \"bad\" Middos as G-d testifies for Avraham that was Middas Chesed on his last test  \"אתה ידעתי כי יראה א' אתה\". He became \"fearful\" (or something). But that's much harder work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is more of a general philosophy question, I don't think you will find a clear answer in the traditional sources.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever we discuss ideal state or actions, they are limited by our real situation. We can change our situation, and thereby change the ideals we can reach. Consider a very practical application - someone without too much money can invest it well, and then have more money available in the future. So if they ask what is the most intelligent way to budget their money the answer depends a lot on how well they can invest it. If they are confident they can invest it and expect a high return it makes the most sense to plan on spending more in the future, but if they have no idea how to invest they need to plan assuming all they have is what they have at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal-ideal for Billy is to not engage in the violent behavior, and to learn better ways to handle his personality. The practical-ideal is more likely to be that he should find legitimate outlets for his violence, even if that means being the state executioner (to continue with your example) assuming that he reasonably believes this outlet will free him from unhealthy pressure and open the way him to change in a positive way. The minimal-ideal is to take any legitimate outlet, even if it makes his personality more destructive, as long as he can stay away from illegitimate violence. </p>\n\n<p>The best way to approach this question is not \"should I do this or that\", but, \"what capacities do I have, how can I develop them, and what is the best way for me to accommodate my current personality as I work on developing myself.\"</p>\n\n<p>What seems like a very negative choice (in the question, being an executioner) may be an excellent choice if it is part of a life-long change and development plan. What seems like the ideal choice - suppressing the violent instincts completely, and not giving them an outlet - is a pretty poor choice if it is not part of a plan.</p>\n\n\n",

He said to him, 'What was Hashem doing at that time?' He said to him, 'He laughed and said, \"My children have triumphed over Me.\"'\" That is to say: Hashem was happy that His children were going in the way of the Torah and its mitzvah to follow the majority. That which He said, \"My children have triumphed over Me,\" G-d forbid that there should be triumph against Hashem, but the explanation of this matter is based on this idea. In this dispute between R' Eliezer and his colleagues, the truth was like R' Eliezer, like the Bas Kol which agreed with him. Even though the truth was with him, because of the depths of his knowledge compared to his colleagues, they were unable to understand him. They did not want to agree to him even after the Bas Kol, and they brought a proof from the fixed rule in the Torah which commands us to follow the majority, whether they say the truth or are mistaken. On this Hashem said \"My children have triumphed over Me\" - that is to say, since they strayed from the truth (since R' Eliezer had discerned the truth in this), and they were approaching him from the power of the mitzvah to follow the majority always, if so in any event he should have agreed to them in this instance like their words, that the truth be pushed aside, and so it's as if the Master of Truth was triumphed upon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Interestingly enough, Rambam mentions that if a Prophet is sent to communicate to someone or a group, it is the intended recipient who is to judge the veracity of the Prophet.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam says that the Prophet will be given a sign(s) or miracle that will be meaningful to them (those intended to receive the message) and that he will then communicate his message. If they recognize him to have fulfilled all the pre-requisites for being a valid Prophet and they are convinced by his sign(s) or miracle, then they are required to listen to his message, however big or small it may be and whatever subject it is about. That initial message, which demonstrates him or her to be a true Prophet of G-d, must be 100% true, meaning it must unfold exactly as the Prophet states.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.10.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chapter 10</a>), Rambam explains that a prophecy can be either negative or positive. Those which are positive prophecies (meaning for the good) must happen. They cannot be overturned or rescinded. Negative prophecies however, can be overturned through teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to imply that the initial prophecy which proves credentials would never be negative.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To determine wether one is a prophet we must first define our terms. What exactly is a prophet? In essence, prophecy is solely based on the acquired intellect. Prophecy, according to the Rambam is specified by intelligence. Knowledge is key and is, therefore, the pre-request for prophecy. This includes the investigation into metaphysics, philosophy, and science. Those are the credentials for prophethood.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, when emanation from the overflow of Active (or Agent) Intellect enters a person's rational faculty and imaginative faculty, alluding a person's reasoning abilities to foresee the future, a prediction is made. For prediction is a manifestation of intelligence. But this is not entirely true for a prophetic vision may be expunged or canceled. Hence a prophet can only see what ought to be and not what will be. That is to say, when prophecy is revoked, it is not the cause of G-d but the nature of the person's continuity at work. Thus prophecy is a natural event. Which is to say, though intellectually gifted, a healthy-wise person may befall dire circumstances that prevent him or her from prophecy, say if the person becomes sick or ill, preventing them to think. When such a divergence is inevitable, the prophecy may be lost, if not compromised.</p>\n\n<p>But it is more than the cold calculated intellect at work. Such a person must be moral in all aspects of life if they wish to become immune to natural law. The Rambam states that a prophet is a moral person who loves G-d yet \"love\" is an emotion and the Torah cannot ascribe a feeling to G-d. When the Torah commands us to love G-d it is expecting us to put that \"love\" in the form of application. That is, in accordance with right action, right speech, and right thought, one should study G-d's Creations. This is what it is meant when the Midrash says Abraham discovered G-d by studying the heavens, natural law, G-d's laws. This is similar to Plato's Republic, who explains the perfect lawgiver, a Philosopher-King, who has reached ultimate perfection. A perfection which Maimonides attributes to a prophet. </p>\n\n<p>Thus the qualities of a prophet, Maimonides affirms, is not secluded to Israel alone but is entitled to everyone. Even non-Jews can become prophets. Indeed, Maimonides considered Aristotle to be a prophet because of his immense intelligence. Thus a prophet is a person who loves G-d, develops his or her intellect, and can use midrashic imagination to carry out G-d's will.</p>\n\n<p>If a person does not meet these requirements as described above, you do not have to listen to him.</p>\n\n\n",

Because the <em>pesukim</em> at the beginning of the <em>selichos</em> service are like the <em>pesukei dezimra</em> of <em>selichos</em> (so to speak), we say <em>ashrei</em> because <em>ashrei</em> is the main piece of <em>pesukei dezimra</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

If he genuinely regrets the path that he chose and would never do a similar thing again knowing the halacha, he can be forgiven for the rebelliousness of his previous actions (as he didn't know, they were never rebellious in the first place. However, if he were not to have any regret, that would have been a rebellion).</p>\n\n<p>However, as he persists in his transgression after knowing that it is forbidden and that loyalty to God should come before his family (however hard that may be), he can not be forgiven for the underlying perpetual sin that he commits (provided that he has the capability to do the right thing and is not considered <em>anus</em>).</p>\n\n<p>I know I have not provided sources - this is because the answer is based almost entirely on common sense.

If one misses the mark they can reach into their pouch and try again.

When they found him in the morning under 5 feet of snow:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פרקוהו והרחיצוהו וסיכוהו והושיבוהו כנגד המדורה אמרו...<br>\n  <strong>ראוי זה לחלל עליו את השבת</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>They extricated him from the snow, and they washed him and smeared oil on him, and they sat him opposite the bonfire to warm him. <strong>They said: This man is worthy for us to desecrate Shabbat for him.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Sefaria's WD comment:</em> <strong>Saving a life overrides Shabbat in any case; however, this great man is especially deserving.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I understand from that wording (assuming they actually uttered it) that for them not every Jew was worth of saving on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>When learning Hilchos Shabbos (Shus OC 328-330) I don't recall any discussion of who's worth or not be saved on Shabbos. Is it a Machlokes ever since? Who (besides them) holds the opinion that some Jews are not worthy of being saved?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In the course of a wide-ranging teshuvah about pikuach nefesh on Shabbos, the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14507#p=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzitz Eliezer</a> <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14507#p=82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quotes</a> <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14507#p=87\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several</a> explanations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>(from Kapei Aharon) According to one view (R' Shimon ben Menasya), it might be permissible to violate Shabbos for pikuach nefesh only if the person will thereby be able to keep future Shabbosos, but not for חיי שעה, if they're anyway going to die soon. (That's not the accepted halachah, though.) Shmaya and Avtalyon may have held according to this opinion, and so they were saying that for such a person, even his חיי שעה is worth breaking Shabbos to save. (He notes that they said this only <em>after</em> they treated Hillel, because the point wasn't to urge their students to do everything possible to save his life - they would know to do that anyway, unless indeed they had reason to think that he'd have only חיי שעה.)</p></li>\n<li><p>(based on an opinion cited in Minchas Chinuch) Possibly, according to that view, only derabanans may be violated for חיי שעה, not deoraisas. The things they did for Hillel (bathing and anointing him, and putting him in front of a fire to warm up) are all derabanans, so their point was that for such a person, we could have violated even deoraisas if necessary.</p></li>\n<li><p>(from the Shevus Yaakov) Even though Hillel had risked his own life getting into this situation, the fact that he did it for the sake of Torah makes it permissible to break Shabbos to save him (whereas in other cases, if a person puts themselves in danger, it may not be allowed to do so - the Tzitz Eliezer goes on to discuss this point, and the different opinions about it, in detail).</p></li>\n<li><p>(from the Chida) Of course we break Shabbos to save any Jew's life. But if the person then ends up committing aveiros, they might well have been (spiritually) better off if they hadn't being saved. Shmaya and Avtalyon were saying that Hillel, being a tzaddik gamur who had mesiras nefesh for Torah, is not like that - he's far better off having had Shabbos broken to save his life.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

He said about him: They abandon eternal life, the study of Torah, and engage in temporal life, prayer, which includes requests for mundane needs.</strong> The Gemara explains: And Rav Hamnuna held that the time for prayer is distinct and the time for Torah is distinct. The time that one devotes to prayer is not at the expense of the time devoted to Torah study. Similarly, the Gemara relates that Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Zeira and they were engaged in the study of halakha. The time for prayer was approaching and it was getting late and Rabbi Yirmeya was hurrying to conclude the subject that they were studying in order to pray. Rabbi Zeira read this verse as applying to Rabbi Yirmeya: “One who turns his ear from hearing Torah, his prayer is also an abomination” (Proverbs 28:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the majority of the davening at Rosh-Hashanah is dedicated to prayers for our personal wellbeing (even מלכויות וזכרונות), it can surely be considered חיי שעה.</p>\n<p>Did this approach make a way to the later generations?

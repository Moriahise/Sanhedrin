Some say that \"pi\" refers to the Egyptian word \"house\", so it would mean \"The House of Khirot\" and Khirot may refer to the name of a place somewhere along the Nile that has the root KhRT (חר\"ת) in it. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-HaHiroth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, William Smith identified it with Arsinoe, near the Suez Gulf, Strong's identified it as being along Egypt's east border (which would relate it to Ba'al Tzephon's location; see below) and Colin Humphries thought it was somewhere around the Gulf of Eilat.</p>\n<p>According to Da'at Mikra on the verse, Migdol was an Egyptian fort either in what is now <a href=\"https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-444038&fid=1609&c=egypt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gebel Abu el Hassan</a> or in Gebel Mur.</p>\n<p>Ba'al Tzephon was probably a temple of a deity called in Hebrew Ba'al Tzephon, probably a Canaanite and possibly also an Egyptian deity; \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'al</a>\" being the name or title of multiple Semitic deities. As for the Egyptian incarnation, according to <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/maamarim/hatanach3-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this essay</a> in the Hebrew site Da'at, he may have been the Egyptian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sopdu</a>, god of the sky and the eastern Egyptian border, which makes sense, considering Sopdu was a dog-headed deity, which ties into both a <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19432&pgnum=165\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash</a> that says that Ba'al Tzephon had the image of a dog and the interpretation mentioned by R' Nissim of Marseilles that some understand Ba'al Tzephon as referring to the \"dog of the sky\" (i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sirius</a>) (<a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH001963866/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aseh Nissim, pg. 317</a>) and with the direction the Israelites were going (towards the land of Canaan, east of Egypt). As such, his temple was probably somewhere along Egypt's eastern border. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohanan_Aharoni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yochanan Aharoni</a> in \"The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography\", pg. 157 in the Hebrew edition, Ba'al Tzephon's location is known from extra-Biblical sources as a temple of a group of seafarers located at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbonian_Bog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sabkhat al-Bardawil</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

[Bava Batra 15b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the Torah tells us that many other Gentiles also had contact with God.  For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God said to Noah... [Gen. 6:13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And God appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night. [Gen. 31:24]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why do they not count?  Because they came before the Exodus?  Because prophecy is more than just God speaking to a person?  What is the definition of a Gentile prophet?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>If you read the next few lines in the gemara Bava Batra 15b, you will see that the premise of the question is incorrect. The gemara clarifies that these seven listed are not gentile prophets, but rather prophets to the gentiles. Thus, possibly Iyov, included in the list, and certainly Elihu ben Barachel, included in the list, are Jewish, but prophesied <strong>to</strong> the nations of the world. Which is in fact what you quoted above from the gemara in your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seven prophets prophesied to the nations of the world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>without mention that they were gentiles. Here is what the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15b.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ensuing gemara clarifies</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וליטעמיך אליהוא בן ברכאל לאו מישראל הוה והא כתיב ממשפחת רם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>that is,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said to him: And according to your reasoning that Job could not have been Jewish because he prophesied to the nations of the world, was Elihu ben Barachel not a Jew? Is it not written: “Of the family of Ram” (Job 32:2), meaning Abraham?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא אינבוי אינבי לאומות העולם ה\"נ איוב אינבוי אינבי [לאומות העולם] אטו כולהו נביאי מי לא אינבוי לאומות העולם התם עיקר נביאותייהו לישראל הכא עיקר נביאותייהו לאומות העולם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>that is,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather, one must explain that Elihu is included in this list because he prophesied to the nations of the world; and so too it may be maintained that Job is included in this list, even though he is Jewish, because he prophesied to the nations of the world. The Gemara asks: But did not all the other prophets also prophesy to the nations of the world? Why then are only these seven mentioned? The Gemara answers: There, with regard to the other prophets, their main prophecies were directed to Israel, whereas here, with regard to these seven prophets, their main prophecies were directed to the nations of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This point was spelled out in Joshua 4,24 when he referred to G’d having split the waters of the Jordan to enable the people to wade across.

    "content": "# What does Judaism think about predatory animals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This dichotomy has always bothered me.</p>\n<p>(1) No predators are kosher.  The Ramban went so far as to say that we may not eat them because they are cruel and we do not want to absorb their bad traits.  In the Torah, God promises that if we follow His commandments, He will spare us from them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִשְׁבַּתִּ֞י חַיָּ֤ה רָעָה֙ מִן־הָאָ֔רֶץ -- I will remove evil beasts from the land. [Leviticus 26:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet:</p>\n<p>(2) In the Torah, Jacob compares some of his sons to predators.  Judah is identified with a lion [Gen. 49:9], Dan with a serpent [Gen. 49:17], and Benjamin with a wolf [Gen. 49:27].</p>\n<p>In the Talmud, Rabbi Yehudah ben Teima said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be bold as the leopard, light as the eagle, swift as the deer, and strong as the lion, to do the will of your Father in Heaven. [Avot 5:20]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Familiar expressions glorify carnivores and vilify domesticated and useful herbivores.  For example, being called a lion, a tiger, an eagle, a fox, or an owl, is a compliment.  Lions and tigers convey strength, eagles convey majesty, foxes convey cleverness, and owls convey wisdom.  But being called a pig, or a dog, or a cow, or a weasel, or a chicken, or a turkey, or an ass, or an elephant, or a goat, or a monkey, or a rat, or a shrimp, or a toad, or a worm, is a grave insult!</p>\n<p>Is this disconnect ever discussed in the Sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a difference between learning from an animal and ingesting it. We can learn to be bold as the leopard to serve G-d, while not taking its predatory nature. And Jacob can bless Judah with the strength of a lion, without telling him to be predatory in nature. But when you ingest something, you get it in its entirety, good and bad. And so the Torah forbids us to eat predators, lest we ingest their predatory nature.</p>\n<p>Jacob also compares Joseph to a bull, Yissachar to a donkey, and Naftali to a deer, so comparing people to prey animals is not inherently bad.</p>\n\n\n",

However, to now eat the mixture  isn't an Issur Deorisa of Basar Bchalav, therefore you wouldn't get Malkus. The Rambam explains this, there's no Issur Bishul by Nevelah/Chelev, therefore when you're M’vasheling it with Chalav you're oiver on BB”ch and deserve Malkus. Whereas you wouldn't get Malkus for eating the Nevelah/Chelev mixed with Chalav due to BB”ch, since the Issur to eat Nevelah/Chelev exists, hence the concept: Ayn Issur Chal al Issur. Now, in a case of BB”ch Nevelah/Chelev the Rambam says it's not Assur B'hana'ah. The reason being: because Ayn Issur Chal Al Issur, the Issur of Hana'ah is learnt out from Achilah, therefore since there's no Issur of Achilas BB”ch by Nevelah/Chelev due to Ayn Issur Chal Al Issur (since they're Assur M'diorisa by themselves), therefore there's no Issur of Hana'ah by Achilas BB”ch Nevelah/Chelev. Tosfos doesn't seem to argue with the Rambam, concluding by saying in a place where's it's not Assur B’achila it's also not Assur B'hana'ah, therefore B’makom Hefsed Lo Yafsed. The Pri”mg says we learn that BB”ch is Assur B'hana'ah M'diorisa. See the Sh”t Chasam Sofer where he brings the Mi’el Tzedakah in the sefer Kanfei Yonah who says: Workers that'd make candles out of Butter and Chelev are Assur B'hana'ah. Since the candles made out of Chelev aren’t legit Chelev (chiyuv kares), therefore it's an issue of BB”ch. Now, there's no Issur of Achilas BB”ch D’orisa, there's still an Issur Hana'ah here because most meat from goyim is nevelah, so even though there's no Issur BB”ch D’orisa B’achilah, there's still an Issur BB”ch D’orisa B'hana'ah. Says the Chasam Sofer, if you pasken like the Dagul M’rvava then we're not Mazchichim you, but I And my others pasken L’chumrah that it'd be Assur BB”ch B'hana'ah. Even the Dagul M’rvava is only talking about getting Hana'ah from the flame of the candle, but to get Hana'ah from a Kruziel (where you're madlik it b’yadim) the Dagul M'rvava would be Choshesh for Bishul BB”ch. However, if Kruziel is M’sarev with with Acherim then it's pashut that it's batul because there's no min bmino here, whereas by Chanukah candles there is a Minyan.

I don't believe there is a right answer to your questions. I did struggle with many of these same issues when I wrote a sefer on Chumash. Here are a few thoughts on some of them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You need to decide how you will publish it. If you will use a regular publisher, ask them, they have a lot of experience. If you're publishing it yourself, you still maybe should get an editor and other advisors. It is not possible to believe how much time everything takes if you do it yourself.</li>\n<li>I don't believe that a sefer on Shas can avoid quoting the Hebrew/Aramaic. Whether you translate is a choice as to who you think is the intended audience. For my sefer, translation was critical. Many modern writers for an English-speaking audience do not even quote the Hebrew, just the English translation in italics. That would not have worked for my sefer at all. In most cases I quoted and translated, and I didn't hesitate to make exceptions.</li>\n<li>Sometimes I paraphrased, when the exact words were not at all critical to understanding, but you are taking a risk of getting it wrong. Use your judgment.</li>\n<li>I always gave a reference, but where I didn't think they needed to look it up, I didn't always give a full reference (\"The Mabit says in Beis Elokim...\") My son tends to mark each such instance and tell me I need to fix it, and I expect he's right.</li>\n<li>I don't know how to judge when there are several sources; sometimes one of them is clearly the original and the other one is the one your readers will know. Quoting the first is the \"right\" choice but probably you should quote the second.</li>\n<li>One good guide is to look at what's out there now. Check other sefarim in a similar genre. <em>However</em>, these days it seems like most of what's published now in English is by Artscroll or Feldheim. It may make sense to just imitate their customs, and I did that a lot. It does have the advantage that the readers are used to it.<br />\nWhenever I did differently, someone complained - even when I was absolutely right. Examples: I chose not to italicize words that were familiar to my intended audience, because it fills the page with italics, and I wanted to use italics for emphasis. Shabbos, kashrus... People told me I should do like Artscroll, and I told them that the Chicago Manual of Style agrees with me, and they still complained.<br />\nI similarly did not capitalize Him and He etc. when it referred to Hashem, because no one does that any more except Christian theologians, and people didn't like that either. I explained to them that Hebrew does not use capitalization.<br />\nPeople even told me that I was wrong to put the page numbers on the bottom, because Artscroll (almost) always puts them on the top. Oh, well...<br />\nPeople are used to Artscroll; their conventions put them at ease.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyhow, again b'hatzlacha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a Yisroel perform shira for his own korban? Also, if a Yisroel does shira in the Beis Hamikdash (not for himself), is his shira kasher בדיעבד?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>About the first question, if a Yisroel can perform shira on his own korban:</p>\n<p>According to the Meishiv Davar chelek 4 siman 11 Leviim are simply hired by Yisroelim to perform shira (therefore he says that if a Levi says that he doesn’t want to do shira there is a hava amina that he wouldn’t have to, if not for a pasuk that says otherwise). If so if the Yisroel himself wants to not hire all the Leviim, and wants to do his own shira for his own korban, maybe he can. He only can’t do shira for another Yisroel (or Levi or Kohein) since the Leviim are the ones who get the monopoly on being hired for shira, and the pasuk is קובע that they and they alone are the ones who are hired to do shira for everyone else. But here he isn’t hiring anyone so maybe his shira is acceptable.</p>\n<p>About the second question, if the shira of a Yisroel is kasher bedieved (when not for his own korban):</p>\n<p>Relevant is the Minchas Chinuch 389:3 who says that there is no issur for a Yisroel to do shira in the Beis Hamikdash. My question is if there is no issur and it's kasher, or if there is no issur but it's still pasul. And even if you say not like the Minchas Chinuch, it's still possible that it's kasher bedieved, even though there's an issur.</p>\n<p>[edit - I have since seen the Rambam who says that there is no shira for a korban yachid. If so it would seem to be a davar pashut that the 'baal hakorban', which means any yisroel since we are dealing with a korban tzibur, can't do shira at all, since it's always for a korban tzibur. If any yisroel can do shira then where is it chal the din that leviim are the ones who do shira? So the first question would seem to be answered. The second question however does remain.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See Erechin 11a. It would seem to be a machlokes as to whether a Yisrael can sing the shira.

They both hold that only Leviem may sing the shira.</p>\n<p>This is with regard to singing because we pasken that the main shira was done by singing. However, playing instruments would be different as the Rambam writes in Klei Mikdash 3,3 and the Chinuch in mitzva 394 based on the gemara in Erechin 11a.</p>\n<p>For a longer discussion on this topic see Minchas Chinuch mitzva 394.</p>\n\n\n",

(Rambam Hilchos Rotzeach 1:8)</p>\n<p>Normally Beis Din would only give the death penalty if the infectious disease was given through lethal injection that had the normal ability to kill and if there were  witnesses and warning  . Potential to kill or indirect infection would not suffice. After the infection it would have to seem like the person IS (not may) going to die (Sanhedrin 78a-b).  It would not have to be instant death though . It would be similar to locking someone into a smoke filled room where they will suffocate to death. (see Sanhedrin 77B and Rambam ibid 3:9)</p>\n<p>Even without the death penalty the guy causing the infection would  be considered to be a murderer if the victim dies (Rambam Hilchos Rotzeach 2:3) Sanhedrin would have  the right to kill such a person and if they don’t he would still be severely punished (ibid 2:4-5)</p>\n<p>If the infectious disease only has the potential to kill or the infection was caused indirectly  then it would be like sending a rabid dog or poisonous snake at someone. (see Sanhedrin 76B) The Halacha is that the one who sent the snake or rabid dog would not by killed by Beis Din but the goel hadam (redeemer of the blood)would be allowed to kill him (ibid 3:10) The Gemora Sanhedrin 78A explains that the reason sending a snake on someone doesn’t carry the death penalty is because it is only the causing as opposed to directly killing  someone.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# טט בכתפי שתים - is Katfi Coptic?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.34b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 34b</a> learns the number of parshiyos in tefillin in various ways. One is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"ע אומר אינו צריך טט בכתפי שתים פת באפריקי שתים<br />\nRabbi Akiva says: ... four compartments can be derived from \"totafot\" itself: \"tot\"\nin Katfi means two, \"pat\" in Afriki also means two [and therefore totafot can be\nunderstood as a compound word meaning four.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I once heard Rav David Cohen shlit\"a speak, and he noted that the whole gemara there likes to divide the parshiyos of tefillin into two groups - see for example the ברייתות there of which parshiyos are used, and the machlokes Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam on it, whether the <em>second group of two</em> is in order or switched. Also גר\"ז או\"ח סי' כ\"ז: the reason that tefillin must be precisely centered on the head is so that these two batim should be on his left, and those two on his right.<br />\nRav David said [the rest is my memory or reconstruction]: It makes sense. The first two parshiyos קדש and והיה כי יביאך are in Shemos Parshas Bo as Israel entered the desert, and have to do with Israel leaving Mitzrayim, discussed in those sections a lot. The last two שמע and והיה אם שמוע are way off in Devarim in Parshiyos Va'Eschanan and Eikev, just before Israel leaves the desert and enters Eretz Yisrael.<br />\nTherefore, the first two are represented by כתפי, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Coptic</a>, the language of Egypt. The last two are represented by אפריקי. [See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.222?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut</a> at the end of Parshas Bo, that the Canaanites who fled before Israel were rewarded with another good land - אפריקי. And similarly <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.91a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 91a</a>.]</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful idea.

This was a nation who at kriyas yam suf (the splitting of the Reed Sea), even the shifcha (the maidservant) experienced levels of nevuah (prophecy) like that of Yechezkel (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.15.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, Shemos 15:22</a>). Owing to their higher spiritual level, it seems at odds that they could engage in an experience seeking greater physical pleasures.</p>\n<p>It says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.6.4?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 6:4</a> that the way of Torah is to partake of bread with salt and water to drink.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Ketubot.104a.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos in Kesubos 104a s.v. 'Lo'</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...דאמרינן במדרש עד שאדם מתפלל שיכנס תורה לתוך גופו יתפלל שלא יכנסו מעדנים לתוך גופו</p>\n<p>We say in a Midrash that until a person prays that Torah will enter his body, he should pray that delicacies should not enter his body....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, if the more spiritual/Torahdik way of living is to eat more modest meal, which conceivably they were on the level to appreciate, how are we to understand the fact that the Man gave them the option to partake of whatever fare they fancied?</p>\n<p>Do any Jewish sources touch on this apparent dichotomy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>So after a lot of searching I came across the interpretation of the Gerrer Rebbe in the Sfas Emes Likuttim at the end of Parshas Beshalach <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=154331&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=16091555989699682&pagenum=116\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which helps gives a little a bit of an approach to answering the question.</p>\n<p>Although he is talking about the Man taking on a greater level of taste on the double portion over Shabbos, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן אותו הדור שהי' כל רצון ותשוקה שלהם להש\"י זכו ללחם מן השמים, וזה הכוונה מה שהי' רוצה לטעום הי' טועם, פירוש כפי שינוי הרצון ומדרגת כל עובד ה' כך הי' מוצא במן</p>\n<p>And therefore this generation that had all their will and desire for Hashem, merited to receive bread from heaven, and this is the understanding of whatever a person wanted it to taste like, it would taste. This can be explained to mean, that according to the change of will and level of one who serves G-d, so it was found in the Man...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I think what this is saying, is that the people of the time were indeed on a higher spiritual level and there was a great deal of aspirational striving to get close to Hashem. This drawing close to G-d was reflected in the man. Namely, that those who sought a closeness with Hashem were able to 'taste' this level of ruchniyos in the man - i.e. the eating wasn't a physical experience in isolation but one that transcended the corporeal nature of food - it was a 'taste' of the Divine.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we can build on this, by noting a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.16.6.1?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 16:6</a> which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונמצא שאנשי המן ומלאכי השרת נזונין מדבר אחד</p>\n<p>And we find that [people who ate] the man and the ministering angels were nourished from [the same] thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it is clear that the Man was what the malachim ate which means that its essence was something of innate spirituality. I imagine that the experience of partaking of the man was something that is not of a gashmiyus nature like I initially thought and therefore it no longer would seem like a contradiction that it could taste of whatever it wanted as it had much deeper spiritual connotations.</p>\n\n\n",

Meaning, I thought it was potentially dangerous force which could be used for good endeavors or the opposite, yet this Chazal tells us iron was particularly created for killing.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps it's a reference to what metal was first used for when it was first developed into tools. Rabbi Philip Bieberfeld in \"Universal Jewish History\", Vol 1, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The development of human civilization was brought about by two different races, the descendants of Cain and those of Seth...It is highly significant that Cain, the first killer...became the first city builder. His new goal, of necessity, was to defend himself against a hostile world...He settled in \"the land of Nod, on the East of Eden\". This points to Elam...The choice of this country is easily understood as...Its deposits of ores, especially copper and lead, indicate, furthermore, that metallurgy was initiated there...Among his descendants, urban civilization experienced a tremendous expansion...The climax came with the rise of metallurgy, which is connected with the name of Tubal-cain, the first smith of copper and iron. This new art was soon misused to produce weapons of war. It is possible that the possession of such weapons inspired Lamech, the father of Tubal-cain, in his triumphal song which marks the appalling growth of the spirit of Cain.\" (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4187&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pg. 62-63</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Another city obviously connected with the descendants of Cain is mentioned in the earliest Babylonian king-list. Its name, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad-tibira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Badgurgurru</a>, means 'fortress of workers in bronze'; and it seems very probable that it was one of those founded by Tubal-cain, the originator of metallurgy...This would indicate that the descendants of Cain, after the discovery of metallurgy, conquered the land with their superior weapons and founded new cities (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larak_(Sumer)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Larak</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sippar</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuruppak\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shurippak</a>) among which a constant fight for supremacy raged until they were destroyed by the Flood.\" (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4187&pgnum=68\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pg. 68</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It had already been pointed out that the descendants of Cain, obviously with the help of their superior metal weapons, had conquered the land. Their way of life dominated the earth, and for them life meant unscrupulous selfishness and the deification of power and pleasure...\" (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4187&pgnum=73\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pg. 73</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Rabbi Bieberfeld, metals were used practically from the beginning to further warfare. As such, the art of metallurgy has since inherently been tied to weapons of death and destruction.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This may refer to the halachot of murder:</p>\n<p>Bamidbar 33:16-18</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone, however, who strikes another with an iron object so that death results is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death. If he struck him with a stone tool that could cause death, and death resulted, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death.\nSimilarly, if the object with which he struck him was a wooden tool that could cause death, and death resulted, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbis learn from this that a tool made of stone or wood must be investigated to figure out whether it was likely to cause death in an ordinary case. So if someone threw a pebble, it took out someone's eye, and the victim got infected and died, the pebble-thrower would not be executed.</p>\n<p>In contrast, any blow with an iron tool is always considered legally serious enough to cause death. If someone died from a poke with a needle (however unlikely that was to happen), it is considered murder (Mishneh Torah Hilchot Rotzchim 3:4).</p>\n<p>In other words, ANY tool made of iron is liable to be a murder weapon that 'shortens one's days', unlike tools made of other materials. Therefore, as Rashi says, such a tool is not fit to be used to build an altar to Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

Intimate sowing of seed, cannot apply to a dead person.</p>\n<p>(The Talmud did not simply assume that upon death, the married woman ceases from being a \"wife\", so that should exclude her from being the object of a prohibition; as the Talmud continues:</p>\n<p>\" Rather, according to this opinion, the verse excludes one who has intercourse with a dead woman. As it might enter your mind to say: Since after death she is also called \"her husband’s kin\" (\"She-ey-ro\"), say that one who had intercourse with her should be liable to receive punishment for committing adultery with a married woman. It therefore teaches us that intercourse with a dead woman is not considered intercourse at all.\")(Sefaria online version)</p>\n<p>See Rashi on this Gemara who refers to Leviticus 21:2. The word \"She-ey-ro there means close relative and Rashi  on this verse identifies the term as referring to the Kohen's wife who has died; see also Yevamos 22b and Toras Kohanim 21:5. Thanks to The GRAPKE for asking about this.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Talmud concludes that there is no Torah prohibition for an act of necrophilia upon a neighbor's wife, since the woman has already died.</p>\n<p><strong>Source #2:</strong> Deutoronomy 22:22 \"If a man is found lying with a married woman, even both of them shall die; the man lying with the woman and the woman. So shall you clear away the evil from Israel.\"</p>\n<p>The Talmud in Sanhedrin 66b explains that the Torah teaches here that the term \"both of them shall die\" comes to say that there must be a special case where one person cannot be found guilty because the other partner to the intercourse, is not liable for this act.</p>\n<p>Rashi and Tosafot recognize that there is an opinion mentioned in some versions of the Talmud that the case of exemption taught would be \"The act of Herod\"</p>\n<p>\"The act of Herod\" is necrophilia as can be seen by looking at the Talmud</p>\n<p>in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.3b.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baba Basra 3b</a>: \"It is related that Herod preserved the girl’s body in honey for seven years to prevent it from decaying. There are those who say that he engaged in necrophilia with her corpse and there are those who say he did not engage in necrophilia with her corpse. According to those who say he engaged in necrophilia with her corpse, the reason that he preserved her body was to gratify his carnal desires. And according to those who say he did not engage in necrophilia with her corpse, the reason that he preserved her body was so that people would say he married a king’s daughter.\" (Translation from Sefaria online)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Talmud has one opinion that from the terminology in this verse (Deut. 22:22), the Torah does not prohibit an act of necrophilia.</p>\n<p>The party performing the act of necrophilia upon the corpse cannot be held liable because the \"partner\" to the act is also not liable in this case (the dead cannot be held liable).</p>\n<p>(<strong>NOTE: there are other cases where a party can be held liable where the partner is exempt ie: raping a helpless married woman.</strong>)</p>\n<p><strong>Source #3:</strong> However, in Sanhedrin 78a, the talmud discusses the case of a \"trey-fah\" which is a man who is injured or sick to such an extent, that it is assumed he will shortly, and most certainly, die. Therefore the \"trey-fah\" is given the Halachic (Jewish Law) status, as someone who is technically already dead, regarding many Halachic considerations.</p>\n<p>However, Rava states an exception regarding necrophilia:</p>\n<p>Rava explains that although a man who commits an act of sodomy upon another man who has the status of a \"trey-fah\", should technically be exempt from punishment (<strong>as there is no prohibition of sodomy with the dead</strong>); Still, since the offender had pleasure from the act, and the other person was technically alive with all the physical characteristics of a living body, then the Torah prohibition applies to obligate the offender in the death penalty for sodomy.</p>\n<p>So this Talmudic passage also states that there is no Torah prohibition against necrophilia with a bona-fide corpse.</p>\n<p>But what about an animal and if an animal is dead; or between dead and alive status?</p>\n<p><strong>Source #4:</strong> The Talmud in Chulin 121b, discusses the case of a non-kosher animal slaughtered by a Jew (so he could feed it to his Gentile friend it would seem) that is still thrashing about in its death throes.</p>\n<p>Abayye says (that although an act of necrophilia upon a truly dead animal is not liable at all), that in this case, since the animal is still thrashing, the offender would in fact be liable for committing the act of beastiality with this quasi-dead animal.</p>\n<p>The Chasam Sofer on Chulin 121b, suggests that for technical reasons, Rava and Abayye may argue vis-a-vis comparing source #3 to #4 etc. (See also Rashash in Chulin as well).</p>\n<p>We can conclude by quoting the Rambam Hilchos Issurei Biah, Ch. 1 Halacha 12: (who deals with this issue and finalizes the Law in his opinion)</p>\n<p>\"When a person enters into sexual relations with one of the arayot as a casual act, although he did not intend to do so, he is liable. Similar concepts apply with regard to one who enters into relations with women forbidden by a negative commandment alone or with one of the shniyot.</p>\n<p>When, however, a man has relations with one of the arayot after she died, he is not liable at all. Needless to say, this applies with regard to those women with whom relations are forbidden by a negative commandment alone. When, by contrast, one has relations with a person who is trefe or who has relations with an animal which is trefe, he is liable. [The person or the animal] is [now] alive even though he will ultimately die from this illness. Even when the two signs (in the throat) which validate ritual slaughter were slit but [the woman or the animal] is making its last movements, if one enters into relations with [her or it] he is liable until she or it dies or is decapitated.\" (Chabad.org English online version)</p>\n<p>But besides the above exception about a dying and thrashing animal there is no prohibition in the Torah about necrophilia with a person or animal.</p>\n<p>(It would seem there are Rabbinical and ethical prohibitions under Jewish law, and Jewish thought, that may apply; but that is beyond the question of the OP.)</p>\n<p>I hope this helps,</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.1.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam (Issurai Biah 1:12)</a> says that there is no death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהַבָּא עַל הַטְּרֵפָה אוֹ שֶׁשָּׁכַב עִם בְּהֵמָה טְרֵפָה חַיָּב. חַי הוּא אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁסּוֹפוֹ לָמוּת מֵחלִי זֶה. וַאֲפִלּוּ שָׁחַט בָּהּ שְׁנֵי סִימָנִין וַעֲדַיִן הִיא מְפַרְכֶּסֶת הַבָּא עָלֶיהָ חַיָּב עַד שֶׁתָּמוּת אוֹ עַד שֶׁיַּתִּיז רֹאשָׁהּ:</p>\n<p>(Partial translation) One who lies with a fatally wounded animal is liable... until she (the animal) dies or her head is severed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Without a specific source to the contrary, we would assume that an exemption from the death penalty is an exemption from the Torah level prohibition.

I believe he was saying ‘this is what human life amounts to in your land’: as we know, the concubine was treated like nothing more than a piece of meat, and this fact the Levite chose to demonstrate in unmediated form, like a piece of ‘performance-art’: ‘the play’s the thing wherein to catch the conscience of the king’, as Hamlet said. The modern day equivalent would be an anti-abortion protestor displaying a foetus that has been killed / removed and publicly throwing it in a garbage can: it would show the bystander what they are doing by not taking action against the people who are doing such things. In short, I believe the Levite was saying ‘this is what you are doing if you do not take action’. He was holding a mirror up to Israelite society, confronting them with Truth rather than trying to convince or persuade them of it. ‘Mediation’ of any kind would have been too soft on his audience. <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadaism#:%7E:text=Dadaism%20is%20an%20avant%2Dgarde,art%20greatly%20for%20a%20time.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dadaism</a> might be considered a modern parallel to this approach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Multiple Tribes of Binyamin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the book \"<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99#%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yosef Breslevi</a>\", there's an essay by Yisrael Ben-Shem in which he raises multiple questions related to various appearances of people from the Tribe of Binyamin throughout Tanach. One of the questions he asks is about the phrase \"שבטי בנימין\" (the tribes of Binyamin) which appears twice in Tanach, once in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.20.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 20:12</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיִּשְׁלְחוּ שִׁבְטֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֲנָשִׁים בְּכָל <strong>שִׁבְטֵי בִנְיָמִן</strong> לֵאמֹר מָה הָרָעָה הַזֹּאת אֲשֶׁר נִהְיְתָה בָּכֶם.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And once in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.9.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:9:21</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיַּעַן שָׁאוּל וַיֹּאמֶר הֲלוֹא בֶן יְמִינִי אָנֹכִי מִקַּטַנֵּי שִׁבְטֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וּמִשְׁפַּחְתִּי הַצְּעִרָה מִכָּל מִשְׁפְּחוֹת <strong>שִׁבְטֵי בִנְיָמִן</strong> וְלָמָּה דִּבַּרְתָּ אֵלַי כַּדָּבָר הַזֶּה.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He writes that only Binyamin is ever referred to as being made up of multiple tribes. The question is, of course, why? What does this mean?</p>\n<p>He answers that indeed Binyamin was made up of two distinct ethnic groups which eventually merged: Tribe A: The descendants of Binyamin, natural Israelites; and Tribe B: A group called \"Bnei Yamin\" or \"Bnei Yemini\" which, besides being distinct phrases in Tanach, are also seemingly attested to having existed in <a href=\"http://cojs.org/mari-_1789-1759_bce/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a tablet</a> discovered in the ancient city-state of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mari</a>. According to him, this answer solves all of the other questions he raised, such as 'why did the people of Yavesh Gilad burn the bodies of Shaul and Yonatan if that wasn't Israelite custom?'</p>\n<p>The classic commentators, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.20.12?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from what I've seen</a>, explain that the plural term refers to the families or clans (בתי אב/משפחות) of Binyamin - each family or clan within the tribe was also called a \"tribe\". Ben-Shem points out that this explanation would work, were this a one-time thing or if it was used to describe more than one tribe, but as it's used twice and both times referring to the same tribe - seems odd, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Is there a more Orthodox/traditional answer to this problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi on the verse in Shoftim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.20.12?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Judges.20.12.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that the ten families of Binyamin were counted as separate tribes, so that Rachel could be said to be the ancestress of twelve tribes in her own right (those ten, plus Menashe and Ephraim).</p>\n<p>(It is true that the sons of Yosef are never called שבטי יוסף collectively. However, they are referred to individually as שבט אפרים and שבט מנשה in numerous places, and of course for many purposes they do count as separate tribes.)</p>\n<p>Also note <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 36b</a>, that Yosef by rights should have had twelve tribes descend from him, but that he lost that privilege, and instead ten of them came from Binyamin. That might then be another reason to call those ten families \"tribes.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The reason why Binyamin specifically is referred to as having multiple tribes could be based on a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.33.3.1?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>, that each tribe is also called its own nation is learned from a prophecy concerning Binyamin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף חבב עמים. גַּם חִבָּה יְתֵרָה חָבַב אֶת הַשְּׁבָטִים; כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד קָרוּי עַם, שֶׁהֲרֵי בִנְיָמִין לְבַדּוֹ הָיָה עָתִיד לְהִוָּלֵד כְּשֶׁאָמַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לְיַעֲקֹב (בראשית ל\"ה), \"גּוֹי וּקְהַל גּוֹיִם יִהְיֶה מִמֶּךָּ\":<br />\nאף חבב עמים YEA, HE LOVED THE PEOPLES — Also He loved the tribes with exceeding love. — Each individual tribe may be termed עם (or גוי), “a people”, for, you see, Benjamin alone was yet to be born when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Jacob, (Genesis 25:11, see Rashi thereon) “A nation and a congregation of nations shall be of you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Sanhedrin, ch. 336; Choshen Mishpat, end of Sec. 34,37 regarding testimony38), where it is stated that if a potential witness simply abandons and does not repeat the transgression that had previously disqualified him, he is once again able to testify.39</p>\n<p>(כִּדְאִיתָא בַּגְּמָרָא פֶּרֶק ג' דְּסַנְהֶדְרִין וּבְחֹשֶׁן־מִשְׁפָּט סוֹף סִימָן ל\"ד לְעִנְיַן עֵדוּת),</p>\n<p>This means that he must resolve in perfect sincerity never again to revert to folly, to rebel against G‑d’s rule;</p>\n<p>דְּהַיְינוּ, שֶׁיִּגְמוֹר בְּלִבּוֹ בְּלֵב שָׁלֵם, לְבַל יָשׁוּב עוֹד לְכִסְלָה, לִמְרוֹד בְּמַלְכוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ,</p>\n<p>he will never again violate the King’s command, G‑d forbid, neither a positive command40 nor a prohibition.41</p>\n<p>וְלֹא יַעֲבוֹר עוֹד מִצְוֹת הַמֶּלֶךְ חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, הֵן בְּמִצְוֹת עֲשֵׂה הֵן בְּמִצְוֹת לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה.</p>\n<p>This is the basic meaning of the term teshuvah (“repentance”)—to return to G‑d with all one’s heart and soul, to serve Him, and to observe all His commandments,</p>\n<p>וְזֶהוּ עִיקַּר פֵּירוּשׁ לְשׁוֹן \"תְּשׁוּבָה\" לָשׁוּב אֶל ה' בְּכָל לִבּוֹ וּבְכָל נַפְשׁוֹ, לְעָבְדוֹ וְלִשְׁמוֹר כָּל מִצְוֹתָיו,</p>\n<p>for so does Scripture state: “Let the wicked abandon his path, and the sinful his thoughts, and return to G‑d….”42</p>\n<p>כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב: \"יַעֲזוֹב רָשָׁע דַּרְכּוֹ וְאִישׁ אָוֶן מַחְשְׁבוֹתָיו, וְיָשׁוֹב אֶל ה' וְגוֹ'\";</p>\n<p>In the Torah portion of Nitzavim43 it is likewise written:44 “You shall return unto the Lord your G‑d and hearken to His voice…with all your heart….”45</p>\n<p>וּבְפָרָשַׁת נִצָּבִים כְּתִיב: \"וְשַׁבְתָּ עַד ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ וְשָׁמַעְתָּ בְקוֹלוֹ וְגוֹ', בְּכָל לְבָבְךָ וְגוֹ'\",</p>\n<p>[So, too:] “Return, O Israel, unto the L-rd your G‑d…”46; [and elsewhere:] “Bring us back, O L-rd, unto You….”47</p>\n<p>\"שׁוּבָה יִשְׂרָאֵל עַד ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ וְגוֹ'\", \"הֲשִׁיבֵנוּ ה' אֵלֶיךָ וְגוֹ'\".</p>\n<p>Repentance, then, entails returning to G‑d, performing His commandments, and refraining from sin.</p>\n<p>This differs from the popular conception that repentance is synonymous with fasting on account of one’s sins.</p>\n<p>וְלֹא כְּדַעַת הֶהָמוֹן, שֶׁהַתְּשׁוּבָה הִיא הַתַּעֲנִית.</p>\n<p>Even in the case of sins punishable by excision or execution, where atonement is made complete by suffering, as previously quoted from the Baraita in Yoma,</p>\n<p>וַאֲפִילוּ מִי שֶׁעָבַר עַל כְּרֵיתוֹת וּמִיתוֹת בֵּית־דִּין, שֶׁגְּמַר כַּפָּרָתוֹ הִיא עַל־יְדֵי יִסּוּרִים,</p>\n<p>this means that it is G‑d Who brings suffering upon the sinner in order to complete his atonement</p>\n<p>הַיְינוּ, שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ־בָּרוּךְ־הוּא מֵבִיא עָלָיו יִסּוּרִים</p>\n<p>(48as the verse clearly specifies, “With a rod shall I remember [their sin]”).</p>\n<p>(וּכְמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב: \"וּפָקַדְתִּי בְשֵׁבֶט וְגוֹ'\" – \"וּפָקַדְתִּי\" דַיְיקָא),</p>\n<p>That is to say: When G‑d finds his repentance acceptable, as he returns to Him with all his heart and soul, out of love,</p>\n<p>וְהַיְינוּ, כְּשֶׁתְּשׁוּבָתוֹ רְצוּיָה לְפָנָיו יִתְבָּרֵךְ, בְּשׁוּבוֹ אֶל ה' בְּכָל לִבּוֹ וְנַפְשׁוֹ מֵאַהֲבָה,</p>\n<p>then following the initiative undertaken from below, and “as water reflects the countenance…,”49 there is an awakening Above, arousing G‑d’s love and kindness, to scour his sin and entirely cleanse him of it through affliction in This World,</p>\n<p>אֲזַי, בְּאִתְעָרוּתָא דִלְתַתָּא וְ\"כַּמַּיִם הַפָּנִים וְכוּ'\" – אִתְעָרוּתָא דִלְעֵילָּא, לְעוֹרֵר הָאַהֲבָה וְחֶסֶד ה' לְמָרֵק עֲוֹנוֹ בְּיִסּוּרִים בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה,</p>\n<p>in the spirit of the verse, “For he whom the L-rd loves, He chastises….”50</p>\n<p>וּכְמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב: \"כִּי אֶת אֲשֶׁר יֶאֱהַב ה' יוֹכִיחַ וְגוֹ'\".</p>\n<p>This is something quite different from any fasts or afflictions that an individual undertakes himself.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that the Rambam and Sefer Mitzvot Gadol51 make no mention whatsoever of fasting as related to the mitzvah of repentance, even in the case of sins punishable by excision or capital sins.</p>\n<p>וְלָכֵן לֹא הִזְכִּירוּ הָרַמְבַּ\"ם וְהַסְּמַ\"ג שׁוּם תַּעֲנִית כְּלָל בְּמִצְוַת הַתְּשׁוּבָה, אַף בִּכְרֵיתוֹת וּמִיתוֹת בֵּית־דִּין,</p>\n<p>I.e., fasting is not required even with regard to those sins whose atonement is completed through suffering.</p>\n<p>They cite only confessing [verbally] and requesting forgiveness, as the Torah prescribes, “They shall confess their sin….”52</p>\n<p>רַק הַוִּידּוּי וּבַקָּשַׁת מְחִילָה, כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב בַּתּוֹרָה: \"וְהִתְוַדּוּ אֶת חַטָּאתָם וְגוֹ'\".</p>\n<p>Why are confession and requesting forgiveness indeed part of repentance?</p>\n<p>Every sin consists of a body and a soul. The actual misdeed itself is the “body” of the sin, and the bodily pleasure and ensuing desire with which it was committed are its “soul.” Repentance involves eliminating both these elements.</p>\n<p>The “soul” of the sin is eradicated by the earnest regret of the individual, who is mortified and pained by his past. Inasmuch as pain is the opposite of pleasure, it negates the pleasure which had earlier aroused his desire to sin and thereby obliterates the “soul” of the sin.</p>\n<p>However, the “body” of the sin also needs to be nullified. Simply refraining from further transgression lacks the action that would negate the sinful act itself, its “body.” This is accomplished through verbal confession, for “verbalization is also considered to be an action.”53</p>\n<p>At any rate, verbal confession is thus a component of repentance while fasting is not.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is perhaps a bit more general than you want, but Rabbenu Yonah, in his definitive treatise on repentance (שערי תשובה – Shaarei Teshuvah) details twenty steps towards a full repentance, the tenth of which is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Act in a manner contrary to the sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the Midrash says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have done piles of sins, do piles and piles of commandments that correspond to them.

Or is this טומאה that he still has the remainder of the old טומאה; the הזאות aren't מטהר him completely and leave over this remaining טומאה until טבילה והערב שמש.</p>\n<p>I have some ראיות and נ\"מ on this, was wondering if anyone had any more for me.</p>\n<p>A possible nafka mina in this chakira is if someone who touches this person who was tamei mes and then had hazah done to him, is it considered tamei mes for the din of tumah hutra btzibur where the halacha is that only tamei mes is hutra btzibur (see gvuras ari Yuma 14a d”h lmaze umazin alav tahor vnogeah tamei). If the old tumah of tumas mes is still there, then we would say tumah hutra btzibur, but if it’s a new tumah, maybe not.</p>\n<p>With this chakira perhaps we can also answer the question of the Chavatzeles Hasharon on Tosfos in chulin 11a (d”h מנא). Tosfos says that the chezkas tumah of the gavra is misnaged to the tahara of the mei chatas (and therefore says that the parah is a treifa). The Chavatzeles Hasharon asks, why is it misnaged to the hechsher of the mei chatas, the hazah isn’t metaher the gavra until tvila, so the chezkas tumah shouldn’t be soser that.\nAccording to the tzad in our chakira that the hazah is metaher him legamri it’s possible that this kasha is answered, the tahara of the hazah is indeed misnaged to the tumah of the gavra.</p>\n\n\n",

So the text goes וברא בו נקבים נקבים חלולים חלילים and we interpret Nekavim to mean holes of some sort, and Chalulim to mean veins or organs, aka solid things. So the bracha says “holes and solid things”. But then later in the bracha it says שאם יפתח אחד מהם או יסתם אחד מהם, where it mentions “if one of them OPEN or one of them CLOSE.” Obviously the opening would be referring to the Chalulim, the solid things, while the closing would refer to the holes. So why doesn’t the line say closing before opening so that it would line up with “holes and organs.” In other words, first the holes are mentioned and then the organs are.

In order to remove absorbed flavor, a higher\ntemperature is needed than the temperature in which the food was\ncooked. The temperature of the water must be boiling in order to\nremove all of the flavor.</strong> It should be noted, however, that Rav Moshe\nFeinstein (Igrot Moshe YD 4:36) and other poskim ruled that in\nsituations of severe need, hag’alah may be done using water only\nslightly hotter than the temperature at which the food was absorbed.\nThe OU does not rely on this leniency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rather, it's simply a symbolic title intended to represent Nevuchadnetzar's might and power as king, akin to the other title in the verse, \"king of kings\" - after all, the only king of kings we know of is Hashem. So why would Daniel call Nevuchadnetzar so? Because that was one of the titles used in the Babylonian court to refer to the king:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...והראיה על כך שלא ניתנה השליטה על בעלי חיים אלא במקום מציאות בני אדם והוא ובכל די דירין בני אנשא, כלומר בכל הארץ, ואין ספק כי בעלי החיים תחת שעבוד האדם והוא שולט עליהן בתבונתו, ולכן מי שמשל על בני אדם יהיו בעלי החיים תחת שלטונו...ולפיכך כלומר מחמת משמעת המלכים לו תיארו באמרו אנת מלכא מלך מלכיא, כלומר יחסך אל המלכים כיחס המלכים למי שלמטה מהם מבני אדם...ואין תימה במה שתיארו דניאל בתאר זה אף שיש שיתואר בו הבורא יתעלה, אבל יהיה מוזר מה שיהיה מן התארים מיוחד לו יתעלה בלבד, אבל יתר התארים הרי רובן דרך השאלה ביחס אליו יתעלה, ומושאלין מתארי הנבראים...ולא יהיה מלך מלכים חמור מן אלהים ויש שהוא נאמר על המלכים, ואף על הדיינים, ונכבדי בני אדם, וזה פשוט מאד ולכן אין צורך להרתע מזה ולהתפתל...ודומה לתואר הזה מה שנאמר בעזרא בהתכתבות ארתחשסת מלך מלכיא לעזרא כהנא, ראיה שהם היו מתכנים בכך מפני שתחת לשטונם מלכים אחרים...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"...and evidence on that control over animals is only where humans can be found, and that is \"wherever men dwell\", meaning all over the land, and this is without a doubt, for the animals fall under the control of man and he commands them through his wisdom, and therefore whoever rules over men, the animals will also fall under his control...and therefore, meaning, because the kings answer to him, he described him by saying \"You, O king—king of kings\", meaning your relation to the kings is like the relation of the kings to those of mankind that are under their control...and it is not surprising that Daniel describes him with this title, though this is also used to describe the Creator, Exalted is He, but it would be strange if he used for him one of the titles that are special to the Exalted alone, but the other titles most of them are borrowed for use toward the Exalted, and these titles are borrowed from the titles of those created...and \"king of kings\" would not be worse than Elohim, and there are cases in which this is used for kings, and for the judges (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.22.7-8?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for example), and the nobility among mankind, and this is very simple, and therefore there's no reason to flinch away from this and squirm...and similar to this title is what is said in Ezra when writing of \"Artaxerxes king of kings, to Ezra the priest\", evidence that they were called so because under their rule were other kings...\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Rabbi Qafich's translation can be found in the Judeo-Arabic section of the Cairo Genizah's website.

    "content": "# Are Muslims fit to be Noahides?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If I'm not mistaken, to be a Noahide you must accept that the Torah is unchanged and from G-d. (I am <strong>not arguing</strong> that this is one of the 7 Noahide Laws by the way, I'm merely saying that this could be a <strong>prerequisite</strong> to be considered a Noahide).</p>\n<p>However, according to my understanding, Muslims are <strong>not</strong> Noahides, since they reject the infallibility of the Torah. In other words, they say that the contemporary Torah has been altered from the one that Moshe Rebbeinu received at Sinai. Therefore, according to their beliefs, they would not feel compelled to abide by the 7 Noahide Laws because they don't believe it to be from G-d in the first place.</p>\n<p>I say the above in light of what Maimonides says in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-8.htm#v11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Melachim uMilchamot, Chapter 8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who accepts upon himself the fulfillment of these seven mitzvot and is precise in their observance is considered one of 'the pious among the gentiles' and will merit a share in the world to come.</p>\n<p><strong>This applies only when he accepts them and fulfills them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and informed us through Moses, our teacher, that Noah's descendants had been commanded to fulfill them previously.</strong></p>\n<p>However, if he fulfils them out of intellectual conviction, he is not a resident alien, nor of 'the pious among the gentiles,' nor of their wise men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> <em>What categories do Muslims fit into in light of what Rambam says above? Are they Noahides?

Not sure if he's referring to just the last one. I think all three could apply.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Quran of the Muslims,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not to worship idols.

But in order to be considered \"Pious among the gentiles\" (i.e, a Noahide) one must accept that these laws came from the Torah, and that they were revealed to us through Moshe Rabbeinu A\"S. According to the Rambam in Mishneh Torah; Melakhim uMilchamot 8:11:</p>\n<p>\"This applies only when he accepts them and fulfills them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and informed us through Moses, our teacher, that Noah's descendants had been commanded to fulfill them previously.\nHowever, if he fulfills them out of intellectual conviction, he is not a resident alien, nor of 'the pious among the gentiles,' nor of their wise men.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Qur’an repeatedly affirms that the Word of Allah is unchangeable and that its texts remain preserved for all time. As stated in Surah Al-An’am: <strong>“And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His words”</strong> <strong>(6:115).</strong> Similarly, in Surah Al-Kahf, Allah declares: <strong>“None can alter His words”(18:27).</strong> This fundamental principle applies to all revealed scriptures, as they are all divine words, and Allah’s revelation remains intact and protected across generations. Anyone claiming that the Word of Allah has been altered is, in effect, denying the clear testimony of the Qur’an itself.</p>\n<p>Our belief is that the <strong>Torah</strong>, too, is a divinely revealed and pure scripture, and that its original text remains preserved. The Qur’an describes it as a source of <strong>guidance and light (Al-Ma’idah: 44)</strong> and <strong>instructs the People of the Book to refer to it in matters of dispute (Al-Ma’idah: 43–44)</strong>. This confirms that the <strong>Torah exists in its original form and that no one can alter Allah’s words.</strong></p>\n<p>However, the Qur’an also clarifies that, at times, certain individuals among the Children of Israel distorted the interpretation or exegesis of the scripture according to their desires, rather than altering the original text itself. As stated: <strong>“They change the words from their proper places” (An-Nisa: 46)</strong>. The phrase <strong>“from their proper places”</strong> indicates that while the original text remains intact, its contextual meaning and interpretation were misrepresented. <strong>The Qur’an thus distinguishes between the preservation of the original scripture and the wrongful manipulations of some individuals.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This principle is also evident in contemporary misrepresentations. For example, some people attempt to justify homosexuality using the Qur’an or other revealed texts. Such attempts involve taking the verses out of context and misinterpreting their meaning. The story of the people of Lot in the Qur’an serves as a clear example: Allah explicitly condemned their unnatural acts and prescribed severe punishment. This demonstrates that there is no legitimacy for such behavior in Islamic law, and those who try to validate it are misrepresenting the divine message.</strong></p>\n<p>In simple terms, <strong>our position is that the Torah remains pure and preserved in its original form, and no alteration has occurred to its text. However, some individuals have historically distorted its interpretation according to their desires, which is explicitly condemned in the Qur’an. Similarly, anyone who misuses divine words for worldly gain or personal inclination commits a sin, while the original texts of Allah remain safeguarded.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

And even if one says the entire Torah\noriginated from Heaven except for this verse, i.e., any one verse,\nclaiming that the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not say it but Moses\nhimself said it on his own, this is included in the category of:\n“Because he has despised the word of the Lord.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question: We know that there are disagreements on various versions of our Sefer Torah, an extra or missing vav here or there, an aleph in place of the hey there. How far can one disagree with the current version (say, in the Aleppo Codex) without falling afoul of this gemara?<br />\nAfter all, the text of the gemara is \"but Moses himself said it on his own\" (אלא משה מפי עצמו). That isn't what I'm asking here. I'm asking, if someone says, \"For sure the entire Torah is exactly what G-d gave Moshe. Not one letter was made up or added by Moshe, ח\"ו. But I think <em>that</em> posuk was a copying error later, by mistake.\"<br />\nObviously this kind of thing lends itself to outrageous abuse and people playing games. I've heard that the Muslims claim that we switched Isaac and Ishmael in the Akeidah, ח\"ו! [This example illustrates that someone doing this is likely to run afoul of some other issues, like trust in our Sages and their transmission.] I'm asking about an honest sincere Bible critic, say, if there is such a thing.<br />\n(This came up because I heard today that some secular scholars make exactly such claims about the Ibn Ezra; I know nothing about the details, maybe others do. But I just heard a chareidi chacham reject such claims because, \"Chas Vashalom!, the Ibn Ezra wouldn't believe something heretical!\" So that would go into my question: Is it possible someone could believe that because there's nothing really wrong with it?)</p>\n<p>Added: I am assuming here that the answer to the related question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/44618/how-can-the-rambams-eighth-principle-of-jewish-faith-be-believed-in-light-of-ha\">How can the Rambam's Eighth Principle of Jewish Faith be believed in light of Hazal?</a> is the one given there in the name of Rav Yaakov Weinberg z\"l: The Rambam's Eighth Principle is not concerned with the accuracy of our current text.</p>\n\n\n",

It was a very big chumrah for two reasons. Firstly, there was\nonly a very slight possibility that these cushions and mattresses were\nflexible enough to wrap around a person and give him warmth. It is\npermissible to sit on stiff objects, even if they contain shaatnez.\nSecondly, such cushions and mattresses only contain linen and wool\nfibers, not woven shaatnez, and the halachah follows the other\nRishonim, that a mixture of linen and wool fibers is only assur\nmiderabbanan. Thus, these pious Jews acted in deference to the lone\nopinion of the Rambam, and were machmir even with stiff cushions and\nmattresses, that could only vaguely be seen as providing warmth and\nprotection in the manner of a piece of fabric that is worn. For these\nreasons, such cushions were seen by the great majority of Klal Yisroel\nas entirely permissible, but were avoided by the scrupulous.</p>\n<p>The situation with cushion and mattress stuffing today is different\nthan it was many years ago. This is due to the preponderance of cotton\nand synthetic fibers in the textile industry. By combining the wool\nand linen with a third substance (min shlishi) that is greater in\nproportion to either the wool or the linen, any shaatnez that might be\npresent is nullified. Once this is done, the fibers can even be spun\nand woven into a fabric. Halachah permits shaatnez to be nullified\neven if the wool and linen combination had been created first, before\nthe introduction of the cotton or synthetic fibers.</p>\n<p>The fibers used for stuffing cushions are made entirely from offcuts\nfrom the garment and upholstery industries. They are sold in bulk to\nshredding factories, who make the stuffing that is used in anything\nfrom baseball gloves to shoulder pads to upholstery. These shredding\nfactories purchase whatever scrap material is available. In today’s\nmarket, most of the fabrics are synthetic and wool, whilst linen\naccounts for only a very small percentage of the total. It is always\nthe case that the crushed fiber fillings contain at least enough\nsynthetics to nullify the linen, and often there is enough to nullify\neven the wool. This means that today, there is no reason at all to be\nconcerned about shaatnez in cushions and mattresses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Were it so that \"[he] lived\" was written, this would have contradicted the spirit of the Hebrew language in this context...every schoolboy understands that what's written is that Daniel continued on his duty in Babylon until the rise to power of Cyrus, and then he moved to Persia, and there he saw his final vision \"on the bank of the great river—the Tigris\" (Daniel 10:4)...\"</p>\n<p>According to Rabbi Marcus, the first verse refers to how long Daniel lived in Babylon.

Although I haven't merited to personally know Rabbi Marcus (he died almost a century ago), I've read a few of his books and one essay of his.

Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda said: One who follows Yehuda desecrates Shabbat. Ultimately, Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda himself suffered pain in his eye. He sent a message to Rav Yehuda: Is it permitted or prohibited for me to treat my eye on Shabbat?  Rav Yehuda sent back to him: For everyone else, it is permitted; for you, it is prohibited. [Av. Z. 28b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What do we make of this story?  It almost sounds like a joke.  Can rabbis make exceptions for spite?  Why did Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda even ask Rav Yehuda instead of following his own opinion?  They even seem to be talking about two different things: One cosmetic and the other curative.</p>\n<p>At any rate, the Rambam ruled:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one feels pain in his eyes, being inflamed or affected by some disease, and pus, tears or blood flow from them, he is considered seriously ill, and we may break the Sabbath in preparing whatever cure he needs. [Mishneh Torah, Shabbat 2:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the context (i.e. the passages immediately before and after) it's pretty clear the only discussion is with regard to a therapeutic application, not a cosmetic one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב זוטרא בר טוביה אמר רב: עין שמרדה מותר לכוחלה בשבת. סבור מיניה: הני מילי הוא דשחקי סמנין מאתמול אבל משחק בשבת ואתויי דרך רשות הרבים לא. א\"ל ההוא מרבנן ורבי יעקב שמיה: לדידי מיפרשא מיני' דרב יהודה: אפילו .מישחק בשבת ואתויי דרך רשות הרבים מותר. רב יהודה שרא למיכחל עינא בשבת. אמר להו רב שמואל בר יהודה: מאן ציית ליהודה מחיל שבי! לסוף חש בעיניה. שלח ליה: שרי או אסיר? שלח ליה: לכ\"ע שרי לדידך אסיר. וכי מדידי הוא?! דמר שמואל היא - ההיא אמתא דהואי בי מר שמואל דקדחא לה עינא בשבתא צווחא וליכא דאשגח בה, פקעא עינא. למחר נפק מר שמואל ודרש: עין שמרדה מותר לכוחלה בשבת. מאי טעמא? דשורייני דעינא באובנתא דליבא תלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Zutra bar Toviyya says [that] Rav says: With regard to an eye that is <em>marda</em>, it is permitted to apply <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohl_(cosmetics)#Middle_East_and_North_Africa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kohl</a> to it on Shabbat. The Sages initially thought that [this ruling] applies only where one had already ground the ingredients yesterday, [i.e., before Sabbath], but it would not be permitted to grind them on Shabbat, or to bring them through a public domain, [as this would constitute a desecration of Shabbat by Torah law]. [To dispel this notion], one of the Sages, named Rabbi Ya’akov, said to them: This matter was explained to me by Rav Yehuda, who said that even if he plans to grind the ingredients on Shabbat and bring it through a public domain, it is permitted. [Accordingly], the Gemara relates that Rav Yehuda permitted application of kohl to the eye on Shabbat. Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda said to the Sages: One who adheres to the ruling of Yehuda desecrates Shabbat. Ultimately, Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda [himself] suffered pain in his eye. He sent a message to Rav Yehuda, asking: Is it permitted or prohibited for me to treat my eye on Shabbat? Rav Yehuda sent back to him: For everyone else, it is permitted; for you, it is prohibited. Was it of my own accord [that I issued this\nruling]? It is [the ruling] of Mar Shmuel, [as demonstrated in the following incident]: There was a certain maidservant who was in the house of Mar Shmuel whose eye became infected on Shabbat. She screamed in pain, but there was no one who attended to her. Eventually, her eye burst (<em>paka</em>). The next day, Mar Shmuel went out and taught: With regard to an eye that rebelled, it is permitted to apply kohl to it on Shabbat. What is the reason for this [leniency seeing as one may desecrate Shabbat only to treat life-threatening afflictions?] The reason is that the tendons [shuraynei] of the eye are connected to the valves of the heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282596196_Kohl_Use_in_Antiquity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mahmood et al, <em>Kohl Use in Antiquity</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ancient civilizations used a vast number of natural substances in ophthalmic preparations. These preparations were not only used to treat and prevent eye disease, but were also applied to protect the eyes from harsh physicochemical environmental conditions as well as for cosmetic purposes. One such preparation was given the name kohl, the main constituent of which is lead sulfide, commonly known as galena. Kohl may contain certain herbs and natural substances in an ultrafine powder for application to the eyes... Recent findings suggest that Egyptian eye preparations in the form of kohl led to increases in the production of nitric oxide, a chemical substance with antimicrobial properties. Nitric oxide has also been reported to be an important regulator of ocular blood flow, which is involved in controlling basal blood flow in the choroid, the optic nerve, and the retina.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With regard to why the ruling might be different for Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahum_Rabinovitch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Nachum Rabinovitch</a>, z\"l,  <em><a href=\"http://s.ybm.org.il/hebrew/Product.aspx?Product=83&Category=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siach Nachum</a></em> YD 89 p. 298 where he rules that certain low level risks can be subjectively decided with regard to overriding Shabbos, i.e. based on an individual's personal assessment of acceptable risk to life. Perhaps, since Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda revealed that the risk was acceptable to him, he no longer had the right to override Shabbos. For everyone else, we view the risk as unacceptable and Shabbos is overridden.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(<em>Notably, Rav Rabinovitch is <em>not</em> discussing a case where there is an overwhelming medical consensus that a risk is unacceptable; where there could arise a desecration of G-d's name by ignoring the risk; nor where the risk is to a large population.</em>)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Standard Archway design in Gemara Covers\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I noticed that Mesoras Hashas, Oz Vehadar, and Artscroll Gemaras all have a title page where the title of the Masechta and the name of the publisher are placed in a picture of an elaborate archway. There is some variation, but generally speaking the design is consistent. I have also seen this design on other Jewish stationary like teffillin bags. Does anyone know what the origin of this design is?<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hR0s4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hR0s4.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The design is from the gate-page (also known as Daf Shaar or Shaar Blatt) of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romm_publishing_house\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Romm Press</a>'s famous Shas Vilna:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rjfzX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rjfzX.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(From an original Vilna Brachot. <a href=\"https://dlib.rsl.ru/viewer/01006624106#?page=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n<p>The design is sometimes simply known as \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=vilna%20gate%20page&sxsrf=ALeKk01jxeyDQ8qyWci--C7FnAo1D8PEJA:1612883725790&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjph6iMjN3uAhVDKuwKHQbHDV4Q_AUoAXoECAgQAw&biw=1536&bih=722\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Vilna gate</a>\". There's a lot of symbolism in the design. First of all, the entire concept of gate-pages symbolizes inviting the reader to come and enter the world within the book. In this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8093o4ZT4c&list=PL42CF669D1A2E5485&index=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">video</a>, it's pointed out that the lion on the left is frowning while the lion on the right is smiling. This symbolizes what happens when you see how much you've studied so far and this makes you happy, but then you see how much you have left, which makes you sad. I personally think that the lions look very human-like, and that they may be caricatures of real people, but couldn't find out who (among those I considered were famous Jews, the owners of the Romm Press and even contemporary world leaders).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in styling, it is very similar to Synagogue arks of the Renaissance and Early Baroque periods, and, l'havdil, also altars in churches of the same periods. For example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/66g15.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/66g15.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izaak_Synagogue\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Izaak Shul</a> in Krakow, Poland)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oDmJu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oDmJu.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/jewish-museum-venice/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Great German Schola</a> in Venice, Italy)</p>\n<p>[I think it's preferable I don't post church pictures here, for obvious reasons]</p>\n<p>I contacted a number of people in the fields of Jewish history and Jewish art. Unfortunately, it's not currently known who designed this specific gate-page or whether it was based on an older design - from some other book, or some synagogue - or if the general design was an invention of the artist's mind (which is an engraving, by the way, not a drawing).</p>\n<p>One art expert from <a href=\"http://www.vilna.co.il/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Association of Jews From Vilna and the Vicinity in Israel</a> told me she doesn't know who made the page, but in styling it looked to her like Venetian Renaissance specifically, and there's a good chance that it was based off of a design that Romm employees found in an old Jewish book in Padua (the Romms sent employees all over to copy manuscripts). <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Motti Zelkin</a> of Ben Gurion University, who's considered an expert on the Romm Press and is currently heading a project dedicated to scanning hundreds of Romm documents and organizing them, told me that this story is unlikely. It's possible that the design was found in a book in Rome (Romm employees focused mainly on manuscripts in the Vatican Library (at the end of the Vilna Shas's Niddah, there's an entire description of the making of the Shas. This can be found also in modern editions of the Shas. I recommend checking it out)), but more likely, if it was based on another book, then it was a book already in Vilna.</p>\n<p>However, I did manage to find what appear to be three \"inscriptions\" scrawled onto the lower half of the design:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WvxOr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WvxOr.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to an expert from the Hebrew University's <a href=\"https://cja.huji.ac.il/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Center for Jewish Art</a>, this inscription reads something like \"Bruchocki\" or \"Bruchoski\", with many other illegible letters. Prof. Zelkin informed me that inscription likely reads Baruchocki or Baruchoski, which means \"son of Baruch\", likely a reference to <a href=\"https://www.geni.com/people/Baruch-Romm/6000000005301014015\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baruch Romm</a>, the person who founded the press. He said that it was customary for printers to write their names on the cover pages of books.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CjBms.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/CjBms.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the top-left corner of the \"cube\" at the base of the column, there's something that vaguely looks like Hebrew letters. It may be a mistake, though. Prof. Zelkin thought it might have been adding by a different worker of the press.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H9APv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H9APv.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm almost certain this reads P.Y.S HOLG, though I've searched top and bottom for who this may be referring to and couldn't find anything.</p>\n<p>Prof. Zelkin wrote to me that when the National Library of Israel will re-open, he'll examine the inscriptions I sent to him with proper magnifying devices at the NLI and see what he can come up with.</p>\n<p>If anyone knows anything else, I'd be very happy to hear!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did the Samaritan cities fight with the Hellenists against the Maccabees?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The antipathy of the Judeans towards the Samaritans is well known. Is this simply because of the ethnicity ascribed to them in 2 Kings 17:24-26 and their unsanctioned temple, or were they also mortal enemies in the time of the Maccabees?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Jonathan Bourgel in his essay \"<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/11/628/htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Samaritans during the Hasmonean Period: The Affirmation of a Discrete Identity?</a>\", there isn't any strong evidence for either option at the moment. On one hand, according to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Maccabees%206&version=GNT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Maccabees 6:1-2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Not long after that, the king sent an elderly Athenian to force the Jews to abandon their religion and the customs of their ancestors. He was also to defile their Temple by dedicating it to the Olympian god Zeus. The temple on Mount Gerizim was to be officially named Temple of Zeus the God of Hospitality, as the people who lived there had requested.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-like the Temple in Jerusalem, the temple in Mt. Gerizim was also defiled and repurposed, which would suggest the possibility of some form of kinship or an alliance between the Jews and the Samaritans against the Greeks.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Here again, the category of Jews includes both the [Hashem] worshippers in Jerusalem and on Mt. Gerizim. However, the depiction of the Samaritans in this account remains a matter of controversy, much of this discussion depending on the meaning of the phrase [something in Greek]...none of the main explanations proposed is free of difficulties...many have inferred that the Mt. Gerizim temple was renamed after Zeus Xenios, at the request of the local inhabitants. this interpretation seemingly corresponds to the letter found in Josephus penned by the people referring to themselves as the \"Sidonians in Shechem\" and asking Antiochus IV to allow that their temple be renamed after Zeus Hellenios...There is, however, a noticeable discrepancy between the mention of Zeus Xenios...and that of Zeus Hellenios...As mentioned above...Josephus <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link122HCH0005\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quotes</a> a memorandum allegedly sent by the Samaritans to the Seleucid king...The authors of the missive, who described themselves as the \"Sidonians in Shechem\"...asked not to be persecuted as Jews on the grounds that they were of Sidonian sotck, and that although they observed the Sabbath and \"offered the appropriate sacrifices\", they practiced different customs from the Jews. In addition, they demanded that the temple on mount Gerizim be dedicated to Zeus Hellenios. Josephus, who identifies these Sidonians with the Samaritans, presents this letter as illustrating that the Samaritans were opportunists...Some scholars have assumed that they were reformed Hellenized Samaritans who sought to root themselves in Hellenistic culture...A further suggestion...that the Samaritans were called \"Sidonians\" simply because this name was tainted with the pejorative connotations in certain passages of Isaiah (23:2;4)...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, there might have been a group of stray Samaritans who, like Hellenistic Jews, accepted the rule of the Greeks and worked against the Samaritans (and Jews).</p>\n<p>Bourgel's mention of Josephus, however, is interesting, because it seems that even if one would argue that these \"Sidonians\" were a small sect and were not representative of the majority, the impression made on the Jews, especially as more and more years went by, was that the Samaritans as a whole were Grecian collaborators.</p>\n<p>And later Bourgel writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"After the death of Judas (161 BCE), his brothers, Jonathan (161-142 BCE) and Simon (142-134 BCE), took the lead in the struggle against the Seleucids...Interestingly enough, the grant of these districts was supplemented by the award of exemption from all royal taxes for \"all those who offer sacrifices in Jerusalem...\" This clause, which certainly derived from a specific request of Jonathan (1 Macc 11:28), implies that those inhabitants of the three annexed districts who continued to bring sacrifices to the Samaritan temple on Mt. Gerizim were denied the exemptions. In other words, it seems that Jonathan used persuasion to convince those [Hashem] worshippers dwelling in the regions of Lydda, Aphairema and Ramathaim to recognize the Jerusalem temple as the only legitimate place of worship...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To me, it seems that even if the Samaritans had attempted to side in the war with the Chashmonaim, they would have demanded to be allowed to keep their temple and to have it recognized as legitimate by the new rebel leadership, which would have probably resulted in having the demand denied, which would lead the Samaritans to probably having remained neutral (not having any particular love for the Greeks either).</p>\n<p>So while they it seems unlikely that as a whole they were mortal enemies of the Jews, and most likely remained passive/inactive during the Chashmonaim-Grecian war, their style of worship was probably the main driving factor in growing tensions between the two groups. The problem doesn't seem to have been their ethnicity but their refusal to fall in line with the Judaic mainstream whilst continuing to pass themselves off as legitimate Jews (note that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/104854/non-jewish-altars-and-sacrifices-through-the-history/104855#104855\">non-Jews can make sacrifices outside of the Temple in Jerusalem</a>. If the Samaritans hadn't claimed they were Jews, and there wouldn't have been halachic debates on their status, I believe they would have been allowed to keep their temple as nothing more than a fancy altar).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although they contain \"Jewish blood,\" and are therefore part Jewish, they probably did not take part with the Maccabees against the Hellenists.</p>\n\n\n",

It has always been my understanding that once you have recited <em>Shehakol</em> once you do not need to keep reciting it for each sip.  Perhaps I have been doing it wrong all these years?

Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet even if we were incapable of explaining the strange events in this story; even if we were forced to conclude as the רמב\"ן concludes -- אברהם אבינו חטא חטא גדול בשגגה, \"Our father Avraham committed a grave sin by placing his virtuous wife before a stumbling block of iniquity because of his fear of being killed... His leaving the Land, about which he had been commanded, because of the famine was another sin he committed (עון אשר חטא)\" -- nevertheless, none of this would perplex us. <strong>The Torah does not seek to portray our great men as perfectly ideal figures; it deifies no man. It says of no one: \"Here you have the ideal; in this man the Divine assumes human form!\"</strong> It does not set before us the life of any one person as the model from which we might learn what is good and what is right, what we must do and what we must refrain from doing. When the Torah wishes to put before us a model to emulate, it does not present a man, who is born of dust. Rather, God presents Himself as the model, saying: \"Look upon Me! Emulate me! Walk in my ways!\" We are never to say: \"This must be good and right, because so-and-so did it.\" The Torah is not an \"anthology of good deeds.\" It relates events not because they are necessarily worthy of emulation, but because they took place.</p>\n<p><strong>The Torah does not hide from us the faults, errors, and weaknesses of our great men, and this is precisely what gives its stories credibility. The knowledge given us of their faults and weaknesses does not detract from the stature of our great men; on the contrary, it adds to their stature and makes their life stories even more instructive.</strong> Had they been portrayed to us as shining models of perfection, flawless and unblemished, we would have assumed that they had been endowed with a higher nature, not given to us to attain. Had they been portrayed free of passions and inner conflicts, their virtues would have seemed to us as merely the consequence of their loftier nature, not acquired by personal merit, and certainly no model we could ever hope to emulate.</p>\n<p>Take for example, the ענוה (humility) of Moshe. Had we not known that he was capable of flying into a rage, we would have assumed that his humility was an inborn trait not within our capacity to emulate. It is precisely his outburst שמעו נא המורים (Bamidbar 20:10) that lends his humility its true greatness: We thus infer that he acquired humility through hard work, self-control, and self-refinement, and that we are obligated to emulate him, since it is within our capacity to do so.</p>\n<p>Also, the Torah relates no sin or error without telling us of its consequences .</p>\n<p>Let us learn from our great teachers of Torah -- among whom the רמב\"ן certainly is one of the most outstanding -- that we must never attempt to whitewash the spiritual and moral heroes of our past. They do not need our apologetics, nor would they tolerate such attempts on our part. אמת, truth, is the seal of our Torah, and truthfulness is the guiding principle of the Torah's great teachers and commentators.</p>\n<p>(Feldheim translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Good question. The Hebrew Bible doesn’t try to hide the faults of the patriarchs. Like all people, they were humans, and, like all people, they made mistakes. No one is perfect. The patriarchs were humans. Yet, since the vast majority of people needed heroes to exemplify, many later tried to conceal their wrongs in the Tanakh. For example, despite the Torah showing David's adulterous relationship with Bat Sheba, the Talmud insists that David did no wrong.[1]</p>\n<p>In addition to your list, we might add how Abraham lied to the Egyptians that Sarah was his sister and for when he sent Hagar and Ishmael away. Nachmanides criticized Abraham for these acts.[2] Arguably, Jesus made mistakes,[3] but why would we want to read about extraordinary people to whom it is impossible to relate? Isn't Jesus and Mohammad efficacious as fairies? Rather than accept superheroes, the faults of biblical figures serve as examples for us to improve and learn from their mistakes.</p>\n<p>[1] Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 56a</p>\n<p>[2] Despite these critiques, I think the stories adds validity to the tales of Abraham. For example, the Bible says a prostitute (Rahab) was instrumental in helping Joshua by saving the Israelite spies. If the book was a fake it would not have mentioned this.</p>\n<p>[3] When he cursed a fig tree.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=57b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 57b</a>) tells us that sleep is 1/60 of death:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Five things are a sixtieth part of something else: namely, fire, honey, Sabbath, sleep and a dream. Fire is one-sixtieth part of Gehinnom. Honey is one-sixtieth part of manna. Sabbath is one-sixtieth part of the world to come. Sleep is one-sixtieth part of death.

Here, too, the Sages apparently chose to refer to death by something (sleep) which is 1/60 of it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Well obviusly the reason why he did these sins was because he lacked sleep. A person with the right amount of sleep would never dream of doing these sins.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Many of the things are those resulting from holding water in your hands.

You're noticing a Kabbalistic practice called כתיבת השם בחילוק writing God's name by parts. I won't begin to pretend to understand it, but those who practice it write the different limbs of the letters of the Tetragrammaton in a specific order with specific Kabbalistic meditations for each one, and you end up with some of the letters looking a bit different. (Usually the best give-away is the left leg of the first ה poking leftwards.)</p>\n<p>Note even in communities that generally incorporate Kabbalistic practices, not all do this, either because they hold there's no point in doing the specific writing motions if you don't understand the Kabbalistic intentions (which is common) or because they interpret the Kabbalistic source texts as prescribing a set of motions which don't wind up with the letters looking different. But it's certainly not surprising at all to see it popping up in a Chabad scribe's work.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this include traveling through time, or is one free to roam the annals of history ?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>A deep understanding of the Theory of Relativity is necessary for a Torah scholar - only מיוחסים (Experts in relativity) can be on the Great Sanhedrin. One of the principles of relativity is that space and time intervals are equivalent, with the conversion factor being the speed of light.</p>\n<p>We can then see that a person may travel in time only by the equivalent of 2000 amot - which is around 3 microseconds. Unfortunately, that means that traveling through history on Shabbat is forbidden.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>One of the standard Shabbat songs states in reference to the day of Shabbat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יונה מצאה בו מנוח</p>\n<p>On it Jonah found Manoah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jonah</a> lived after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Manoah</a>, he could only have found him via time travel. As the song states that he found him on Shabbat, this may indicate that time travel is permitted on Shabbat. Though I suppose one could argue that he time travelled prior to Shabbat and only found Manoah on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Note that there is external confirmation beyond the song that Manoah was indeed visited by by a prophet. Judges 13:13 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר מלאך ה' אל מנוח</p>\n<p>And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> in his commentary writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה זה המלאך שדבר למנוח ולאשתו היה נביא בהכרח</p>\n<p>And this angel that spoke to Manoah must have been a prophet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably, then, Scripture is describing this very meeting of the prophet Jonah with Manoah.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is some evidence that this may not have actually occurred, and Manoah would not be a trustworthy source. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Saadia Gaon</a> in Emunot V'Deiot writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, for example, certain monotheists shunned the view <strong>that God was unable to bring back yesterday</strong> in order not to ascribe to him impotence. They thereby, however, let themselves into something worse by ascribing to God an absurdity, as we shall note in part of the second treatise of this book, if God, exalted be He, is willing.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p.25, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It will not, therefore, praise Him for being able to cause five to be more than ten without adding anything to the former, nor for being able to put the world through the hollow of a signet ring without making the one narrower and the other wider, <strong>nor for being able to bring back the day gone by in its original condition</strong>. For all these things are absurd.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 134, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this it seems that time travel is not in fact possible, even for God, and only someone ignorant would believe that it is possible. And we know that Manoah was ignorant, as the Talmud (Berachot 61a and parallels) explicitly declares that he was an <em>am ha'aretz</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב נחמן מנוח עם הארץ היה</p>\n<p>R. Nachman said \"Manoah was an ignoramus\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, apparently Manoah would have simply been one of the ignoramuses who believed the absurdity that time travel was possible, even though in actuality it is not.</p>\n<p>However, to make matters more complicated, if this indeed occurred on Shabbat then perhaps we <em>should</em> trust Manoah. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> explains in his commentary to Demai 4:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמרו בתלמוד שהטעם בעניין שהוא נאמן בשבת לפי שאימת שבת עליו רוצה לומר שעמי הארץ הוא חמור בעיניהם לעשות עבירה ביום שבת מפני כבוד היום לפיכך לא ישקר</p>\n<p>They said in the Talmud that the reason for the fact that he is believed on Shabbat is that the awe of Shabbat is upon him. Meaning to say that the ignoramuses (<em>amei ha'aretz</em>) consider it serious in their eyes to do a sin on the day of Shabbat because of the honor of the day; therefore he will not lie.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would seem to indicate that even Manoah the <em>am ha'aretz</em> should be believed about the claim of time travel, as long as he claimed it on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>However, this only seems to mean that we believe that he is not (deliberately) lying, but who is to say that he is not simply mistaken even though he believes he is telling the truth?</p>\n<p>To address this we need to reconcile a contradiction posed by an explicit Mishnah (Avot 2:5) which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין בור ירא חטא ולא עם הארץ חסיד</p>\n<p>A boor does not fear sin, nor (even) a pious ignoramus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to be saying that an ignoramus does not fear sin even at the time when he is pious, i.e. on Shabbat when the fear of the holy day is upon him. In order to reconcile the previous explanation with this Mishnah we would have to say that when Rambam said that the ignoramus wouldn't lie, he didn't mean that he wouldn't deliberately engage in the sinful activity of telling an untruth (since we just established that even on Shabbat he does not fear sin); rather he meant that he wouldn't utter any untruth at all even mistakenly.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>If this is the case then we would have to assume that Manoah would not only be trusted to tell the truth, but he would even be trusted to provide an ignoramus's perception of the truth. We would then have to accept Manoah's account even over the philosophical objections of R. Saadia Gaon. In case the reader feels uncomfortable attributing such an error to R. Saadia Gaon, it should be noted that he himself acknowledges such a possibility in his introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although I do acknowledge that my learning is far from perfect and admit that any scientific attainments are lacking in excellence, and I am not wiser than my contemporaries,</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And shortly thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also adjure by God, the creator of the universe, any scholar who upon studying this book, sees in it a mistake, that he correct it, or, should he note an abstruse phrase, that he substitute for it a more felicitous one. Let him not feel restrained therefrom by the fact that the book is not his work, or that I had anticipated him in explaining what had not been clear to him.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in sum, it seems that there is certainly a case that can be made for the permissibility of time travel on Shabbat, though it is not quite iron-clad.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1. See e.g. Rashi to Ketubot 57a (which I discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9093/how-does-eilu-veilu-work-out-with-an-absolute-truth/88650#88650\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/110602/can-eilu-veilu-apply-to-historical-factual-reality-or-not/110604#110604\">here</a>) where it seems obvious that the term משקר means a false statement rather than a deliberate lie.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Of course. \"There is no before or after in the Torah\" say Chazal.</p>\n\n\n",

But if you really dislike Shabbatonim, perhaps you should be asking yourself why you keep going to them time and again in the first place?</p>\n\n\n",

He should be compensated according to a consideration of how much less a slave would be worth if the slave had a injured arm. The rabbi said that's a clever way of working it out.</p>\n<p>Then, or another time, we did a Gemara that seemed to teach, that if your father is sleeping, then even if somebody comes offering a large amount of money for some diamonds he has on offer, you should not wake him up.

One example among many:  most locusts are kosher, but most Jews don't know that and assume they are insects, hence unkosher.  The practice is <em>not</em> to refrain from eating them because of Marit Ayin.  (I was surprised, because I thought we must always assume the average passer-by has the knowledge and IQ of a turnip.)</p>\n<p>On (2), the Mishnah says that Jews are supposed to practice דָן אֶת כָּל הָאָדָם לְכַף זְכוּת <em>dan l'khaf zekhut</em> [Avot 1:6] -- giving people the benefit of the doubt, judging them favorably [Leviticus 19:15], not thinking ill of them, but rather advising them as needed.

So the answer is both. The Jews who worshipped idols believed in them, and the prophets of the Tanakh rebuked them for this erroneous belief.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Your question is: \"Judging from the Tanakh, did ancient Jews also believe other gods like Baal actually existed?\"</p>\n<p>Your question if written in scholarly terms would be \"Did ancient Jews believe in monotheism, or monolatry?\" Monolatry is defined as: the worship of one god without denial of the existence of other gods.</p>\n<p>Because of how your question is written the answer is <em><strong>we don't know and as of now no one can know for sure.</strong></em> We don't know because the Tanakh is not usually concerned with describing beliefs. You will find scriptures that portray other gods, or witches, or sorcerers as being real or having powers. And you will find scriptures that disregard anything outside of nature other than God. We also don't know because the Bible isn't a book, it's a <em>library,</em> which means it has multiple authors that span well over a thousand years of history.</p>\n<p>If Book A of the Bible seems to describe other Gods as existing, but Book B doesn't; does that mean that Book B should be used to discredit Book A? Or is it that in Book A's time people believed differently than Book B's time? When Genesis describes as God walking through the Garden, but Deuteronomy says \"behold you saw no shape or form of me on the mountain,\" which of these statements definitively proves what ancient Israelites thought about God's form? The answer is neither of them.</p>\n<p>The only way to truly answer that question is to find other outside evidence from the time to compare against these books. First hand written evidence about beliefs would be great, but we haven't found any such documents. Archaeology would be second best, especially when compared to what the Bible says about Israelite practice during that time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolatry#In_ancient_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Based on the archaeology from within the land of Israel during pre-exilic times, especially when compared against Biblical narratives, monolatry seems likely to be the belief of Pre-Exile Israelites</a>. This is not only because of the vast amount of idols we find all over Israel that date to this time period, but the <em>types</em> of idols we find. For example Asherah seems to be one of the most prominent idols, but she isn't usually worshipped alone. She is often described as being the wife or consort of Y-H-W-H, which is monolatry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Further evidence for Asherah-worship includes, for example, an 8th-century BC combination of iconography and inscriptions discovered at Kuntillet Ajrud in the northern Sinai desert where a storage jar shows three anthropomorphic figures and several inscriptions. The inscriptions found refer not only to Yahweh but to ʾEl and Baʿal, and two include the phrases \"Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah\" and \"Yahweh of Teman and his Asherah.\" The references to Samaria (capital of the kingdom of Israel) and Teman (in Edom) suggest that Yahweh had a temple in Samaria...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah#In_Israel_and_Judah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah#In_Israel_and_Judah</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/20-4/Meshel.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/20-4/Meshel.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Post exilic Judean belief seems to trend heavily toward monotheism. We start to get writings that have survived to the present day that often describe monotheistic practices or beliefs. Archaeological evidence shows idols as a whole tapering off. So a strong argument could be made that post exilic Judeans believed in monotheism and not monolatry.</p>\n<p>But what we do know for certain is that after about the year 1,000 CE monolatry seems to stop existing within Judaism. We see this most clearly because of the writings we have from Jews describing \"proper\" beliefs such as Maimonides 13 Principles of Faith. The clarity of such writings, their focus on monotheism, and their widespread acceptance amongst Jews all over the world are the best proof we have of the vast majority of Jews no longer believing in monolatry, the same way vast majority of Jews stopped believing in exorcism and demon possession.</p>\n\n\n",

And what does he intend to do with them?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In answer to your first question, grapes play a very important factor in our avodas Hashem, as it says expressly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.10.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 10:17</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>תַּאֲוַ֬ת עֲנָוִ֣ים</strong> שָׁמַ֣עְתָּ ה' תָּכִ֥ין לִ֝בָּ֗ם תַּקְשִׁ֥יב אָזְנֶֽךָ׃</p>\n<p>Hashem - You will listen to the <strong>desire of grapes</strong>, You will make their hearts firm; You will incline Your ear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what is it that makes grapes so important? It is because they contain more than just healthy goodness, they are imbued with an innate holiness. As it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.25?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 25:9</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יַדְרֵ֣ךְ עֲ֭נָוִים בַּמִּשְׁפָּ֑ט וִֽילַמֵּ֖ד עֲנָוִ֣ים דַּרְכּֽוֹ׃</p>\n<p>He guides the grapes in the right path, and teaches the grapes His way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, historically, those who imbibe the way of the grape are the natural leaders of klal yisroel. We famously say about Moshe Rabbeinu in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 12:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָאִ֥ישׁ מֹשֶׁ֖ה ענו מְאֹ֑ד מִכֹּל֙ הָֽאָדָ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה׃</p>\n<p>Now Moses was of a very grape-like personality, more so than any other man on earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it stands to reason, as Hashem personally tends to the grapes, and their holy essence helped to shape undoubtedly the greatest Jewish leader in Moshe Rabbeinu,  it follows that the Messiah will have to purchase grapes to gain from this inherent Kedusha and be fitting to lead the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Once these grapes have been purchased he can effectively distribute them to the rest of the Jewish people so that they too embrace the heightened levels of Kedusha. As it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.69.33?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 69:33</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.22?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 22:27</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רָא֣וּ עֲנָוִ֣ים יִשְׂמָ֑חוּ דֹּרְשֵׁ֥י אֱ֝לֹהִ֗ים וִיחִ֥י לְבַבְכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>They will see grapes and they will be happy, you who are mindful of G-d, take heart!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יֹאכְל֬וּ עֲנָוִ֨ים ׀ וְיִשְׂבָּ֗עוּ יְהַֽלְל֣וּ ה' דֹּ֣רְשָׁ֑יו יְחִ֖י לְבַבְכֶ֣ם לָעַֽד׃</p>\n<p>They will eat grapes and they will be satisfied. Let all who seek the LORD praise Him. Always be of good cheer!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the Messiah will purchase grapes, gain from their G-dliness/goodliness and then share them with the rest of the Jewish people to usher in a time of much happiness and  good cheer. Those who do not partake of this grape-fest the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.48b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Yerushalmi Kiddushin 48b</a> warns expressly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי חזקיה ר' כהן בשם רב עתיד אדם ליתן דין וחשבון על כל שראת עינו ולא אכל</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chizkiya, Rabbi Cohen in the name of Rav said, in the future (a reference to the times of Moshiach) a person will have to give judgment and accounting over every grape he saw and did not eat(!)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>A grape is an essential fruit for anyone who hopes to be a king forever.

What is the issue with reading 'kisvei kodesh' on Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The grain of this prohibition and its exclusions, to which SH is alludes, is from the Mishna in Shabbat and Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.116b.3?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">116b</a>). Although the mere recitation of a verse or word, especially of liturgical nature, from Writings is not of Talmudic origin, as far as I know.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As DoubleAA referenced, this starts in the Talmud with Shabbos 116b, then codified by Rambam -- his Shabbos 23:19 reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף לקרות בכתובים בשבת בשעת בית המדרש אסור גזירה משום ביטול בית המדרש שלא יהיה כל אחד יושב בביתו וקורא וימנע מבית המדרש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even to read the Writings on Shabbos <em>at the time of study assembly</em> is prohibited, as the study assembly could become empty -- we wouldn't want everyone sitting home and reading, rather than attending the study hall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically when study relied on communal sessions (recall that a great deal of the law in the Talmud was still based on oral teachings, including so much of practical halacha), we didn't want people missing those. Rashi on the Gemara noted that \"at the time of study hall\" meant before the main meal of the day; once people feasted, they might have a couple drinks to go with it.</p>\n<p>As your local Orthodox rabbi how all of this applies today...</p>\n\n\n",

According to the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.102a.14?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama</a>, we do not assume there is an order to which tractate of the Mishnah was originally written first. This makes a difference because within one tractate, if there is a discrepancy in the Mishnah, we follow the later one, because we assume that was the author's (Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi) final intent. But if the discrepancy comes from two tractates, we don't know the order of which came first or second, as sometimes Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi taught them out of order.

Yaakov actually had 14 daughters: one daughter was born with each of his sons – except for Binyamin – making 11 and then there was Dinah, and Binyamin’s two twin sisters. They subsequently died by the time Yaakov entered Egypt, as evidenced by the fact that they were not counted in VaYigash as part of the 70 who came to Egypt. Yaakov was therefore a bereaved parent 14 times over for the deaths of his 14 daughters. This makes the brothers' causing their (bereaved) father Yaakov to grieve even worse. What child puts a bereaved parent through such hell - again?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Midrash says it was God’s plan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The brothers] decided: “Let us make a vow to excommunicate any one of us who tells our father, Jacob, that Joseph is alive.”  Judah said: “Reuben is not here, and a vow of excommunication cannot be executed unless ten witnesses are present.” So what did they do? They included the Holy One, blessed be He, in their pact of excommunication [and God agreed]. [Midrash Tanchuma, Vayeshev 2:5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So God agreed that Jacob must not be told, because it suited His plan.</p>\n<p>Another Midrash tells us that Jacob’s father Isaac knew prophetically that Joseph was alive, but said nothing. The Torah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And all of Jacob's sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him [for the loss of Joseph].  But he refused to be comforted and said: “No, I will go down to the grave mourning for my son.” And his father wept for him. [Gen. 37:35]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This does not refer to Jacob weeping for Joseph, but Isaac weeping because of Jacob's deep pain...  And why did Isaac not reveal to Jacob that Joseph was alive? Because Isaac thought: If the Holy One, blessed be He, has not revealed it to him, who am I to reveal it to him? [Genesis Rabbah 84:21]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The entire story is one of extreme action. How could they put Yaakov through such grief? Well, how could they plot to kill Yosef, and then carry out a plan to sell him into slavery? This is part of the extreme action that they took, and from the perspective of the story itself, one is not more surprising then the other. They wouldn't sell him only to immediately get caught.</p>\n<p>In terms of the premise of the question, that Yaakov had many daughters who died. Yes, this is one of the two positions in the Rashi you cite, from Rabbi Yehuda (the other position, of Rabbi Nechemiah, being that these were daughters-in-law). And you could bolster your follow-up deduction that they died by pointing to the explicit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.26?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi in Vagiyash</a>, counting the 66 souls. There, Rashi explains according to each position. If like Rabbi Yehuda, then since we are counting women (Serach and Yocheved), then these twin sisters must have died. And if these were daughters-in-law before, then they didn't die, but were simply not counted here since we aren't counting wives. (We don't know that Rabbi Yehuda himself would have agreed with this particular assumption that this is why the twin sisters weren't listed; for instance, it could be because they were also wives.)</p>\n<p>With this assumption firmly established, you write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This makes the brothers' causing their (bereaved) father Yaakov to grieve even worse. What child puts a bereaved parent through such hell - again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the lie to Yaakov was earlier, before the death of these twin sisters. Otherwise, how could the daughters have tried to console Yaakov at the time?! Your question might instead be how they could have continued to remain silent about it...</p>\n\n\n",

I would appreciate an answer with sources. The sun, which determines the arrival of morning and evening in the literal sense, had not been created. Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Hebrew word \"Erev\" as used in Genesis 1:5, means \"mixed up\" in English or \"confusion\". This is because when things get darker, the human eye cannot properly identify forms; and reality is blurred.</p>\n<p>The Hebrew word \"Boker\" means \"clarity\" or \"break-through\" (of light). This is because the coming of light will allow the human eye to once again recognize distinct forms and end all confusion.</p>\n<p>This understanding and translation can be seen in the commentaries of Ibn Ezra, Radak, and Rav Shamshon Rafael Hirsch on Genesis 1:5.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I simply like to translate the verse as:</p>\n<p>There was chaos, and then there was order, one day.</p>\n<p>If you follow the pattern of the creation account, you will see that the six days each have a starting point of \"chaos\" that is set right and becomes \"orderly\".</p>\n<p>The seventh day, is \"all light\" since it had no chaos and was the culmination of the works of Creation. That's why the 7th day has no mention of \"it was erev, and then it was boker\" because the 7th day was perfect.</p>\n<p>Another proof to this approach, is that Targum Onkelos (Aramaic Translation by Onkelos the Convert, lived 35CE - 120CE), translates \"and it was good\" throughout Gen. chapter 1, as \"and it was good\" in Aramaic (\"Ar-ey Tav\"). However, in Gen 1:31, when G-d says (at the end of Creation): \"..it was very good\", Onkelos translates that it was (\"Takin Chadata\") \"a unified order\".</p>\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Genesis 1:1–4 says that G-d created light on Day 1. The light was called \"day\" and the dark was called \"night.\" Verse 5 follows: And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</p>\n<p>How are we to understand this when the sun was not created until the fourth day? We know that light and darkness depend on the position of the sun. So, how is it possible to have light without a sun? The rabbis noted the problem. A Midrash answers that G-d created a \"brighter and more enjoyable sun\" on the first day but hid it for the righteous to enjoy in Heaven.[1] This is not explicit in the text. Another possible solution is that this is the biblical style (Ibn Ezra). For example, Chapter 1 informs us in a broad statement that G-d created a man and woman, humankind, and chapter 2 explains it in detail, Adam and Eve. Similarly, it is possible that G-d created the sun on the first day (verse 3) and improved this light on the fourth day. This improvement would not only grant light but also support life, allowing vegetation to grow (verses 1–4). Although this view is also not explicit, arguably it is a more reasonable view.</p>\n<p>There is one more possibility. It is possible that the Torah account is not meant to be taken literally. It is a parable (Maimonides). The Torah could have used terms such as “light,” “day,” “morning,” and “evening” as metaphors to mean there was an unidentified creation during an unspecified length of time that stopped for a new period of time to begin. Understanding the text this way, we might say that the six-days are to be understood as six periods of time. The Bible is saying that creation took place during a long process with different eras.[2] Thus, Judaism can accept evolution and that the world is millions of years old.</p>\n<p>[1] This is also a Catholic tradition</p>\n<p>[2] See Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 57b, where yamim (days) could mean years</p>\n\n\n",

See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The internal protocol by which tefillin communicate during tefilla is not known. This is an example of well-designed <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering\" rel=\"noreferrer\">component architecture</a>. While it is given to us to know certain things about the public interface of tefillin (the four Torah verses, the straps, the calf's hair, etc), and the design is sufficiently polymorphic to allow for more than one object with a compatible interface (both Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam), we cannot break the encapsulation and know how they internally work. The documentation indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it shall be for a sign for you upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand did the LORD bring you out of Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This tells of their functionality, so that we may use them without ignorance of their purpose, but how they accomplish that task is not our concern. Indeed it is possible that the internal mechanism of tefillin has been changed multiple times if it were the will of Ha Kadosh Baruch Hu, but because the public interface remains unchanged, any upgrades (or let's be honest downgrades) to the internal protocol should not effect our usage of them.</p>\n<p>It is known, however, in the name of Rav Joel Spolsky, that <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">all abstractions are inherently leaky</a>. Actual implementations in the real world will always show behavioral details and differences that are not intended. For example, the Rambam writes that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As long as the tefillin are on the head and on the arm of a man, he is modest and God-fearing and will not be attracted by hilarity or idle talk; he will have no evil thoughts, but will devote all his thoughts to truth and righteousness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can tell you from experience that this expected behavior does not work on all people at all times. Similarly, we have stories of sages of the past using tefillin to drive away demons or protect women in childbirth.  Given the encapsulated nature of the internal tefillin protocol, we cannot know if <em>all</em> tefillin or <em>our</em> tefillin support this advanced functionality.</p>\n<p>This shows how your notion of \"black box\" testing can be quite useful in telling us some information that is not captured in the documentation. Thus far we have mainly used anecdotal testing of tefillin in specific scenarios. We can tell when their use as a sign is effective. We have some non-statistical evidence of their use to enhance tefilla or expel demons, but a rigorous testing framework has not yet been developed. It may be that you are just the person to undertake such a task so that we could then discern which tefillin or which people at what times are able use the more advanced functionality.</p>\n<p>I leave it to you to work out the details of how to implement such a large scale testing framework, and wish you kol tov, and a freilichin Purim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is also easy.</p>\n<p>We know to \"search the Torah over and over, for everything is in it\".  Everything obviously includes all software, firmware, wireless, and technology, which is, was or could be. So we should not be surprised to find that hidden within these strange objects, is some very advanced technology, whose functioning at least we can deduce much about.</p>\n<p>Indeed, inside the Tephillin, we do find writing of a prescribed fixed nature, not a dot or comma of which we also know, may be changed.  The writings within, are clearly some form of advanced  software, probably designed to interface precisely with the hardware - which not uncoincidentaly, is also highly prescribed.</p>\n<p>Attached to each of the hardware items are two long cables of an organic nature. We know that the body produces electricity and that voltages develop between different parts of the body. The cables are of an absorptive durable flexible material that will tend to absorb sweat - a form of salt water, or in other words, a conductive medium. The other side is dry and covered with a dark insulating film also organic in nature.  We know that batteries stack cells to built up ample voltage, so we should not be surprised to find a complex construction of stacked layers, again in a prescribed layout, at least at one cable end.  Hence why we have a redundant setup, but both have long cables.

Tosafot in Bechorot 2b, mentions putting a non-jew in a position to take a oath would be okay if he agrees to the one living God of Heaven and Earth and includes another \"saint\" as well. Some interpet Tosafot that a non-jew is permitted in all cases not just oaths but, even service.</p>\n<p>In Your case, it is direct asking of the \"saint\" and including God in the service. This is different than Serving God with added \"saints\" (which is what Tosafot intended by שיתוף) and would be not permitted.</p>\n<p>Remember that all Idol Worship is שיתוף, very few times in the Torah was there service to Idols without inclusion of God. (etc. Sun, Moon, Stars, Angels, Hosts) The question is which is the focus, if God is the focus than you can rely on Tosafot, if the other Gods are the focus, then even Tosafot would agree that it would be Idol Worship.</p>\n<p>(In my experience with Christianity (which is not much), I see a-lot of variation with this and it seems that each person has his approach to this. Some you can hear the name of the \"saint\" more than God, and some you can hear God, and less the name of the \"saint\", my point is that it's not the religion but, the specific services in the religion)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>The Seven Noahide Commandments prohibit</strong> praying to angels. It is likewise prohibited to talk with the dead because this is impossible. The dead never spoke to anyone. This was the very sin of King Saul. The Bible prohibits it not because it works but because it does not.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Those with empty brains say 'Were it not that fortune tellers and\nmagicians were true, the Torah would not prohibit them.' But I (Ibn\nEzra) say just the opposite of their words, because the Torah doesn't\nprohibit that which is true, but it prohibits that which is false. And\nthe proof is the prohibition on idols and statues.\" (in his commentary\nto Leviticus, 19:31).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for angels, in his fifth Principle of Faith (which every Jew must accept literally), Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is the Blessed One Whom it is proper to worship, to exalt, to\npropagate His greatness, and to fulfill His commandments. But one must\nnot do so for anything of lower existence than G-d Himself], such as\nthe angels, the stars, the spheres, the elements and whatever is\ncomposed of them . . . It is likewise improper to pray that they act\nas intercessors to present [our prayers] to Him. Only to Him shall\none's thoughts be directed; and all besides Him should be ignored . .\n.\" (Commentary of Mishnah, Sanhedrin ch. 10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban agreed. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The third form of idolatry is considering the angels  capable of\nserving as intermediaries between G-d and His worshipers . . . Realize\nthat even to pray to them for this purpose is forbidden to  us ...\"\n(Toras HaShem Temimah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The first Noahide commandment is the prohibitions against idolatry, and praying to angels is idolatry.</p>\n<p>PS I agree with you. Angels are the natural forces. Whenever an angel appears in Scripture this is a vision or a dream (Rambam).</p>\n\n\n",

It is prohibited to read from the Torah, from the Prophets, and from the Writings, or to study from the Mishna, from the Gemara, and from midrash, and from collections of halakhot, and from collections of aggadot. However, one may read from a place in the Bible that he is unaccustomed to reading, as it will be difficult for him and he will not derive pleasure from it, and he may likewise study from a place of the Talmud that he is unaccustomed to studying. And one may read from the book of Lamentations; from the book of Job; and from the evil matters in Jeremiah, i.e., his prophecies of doom. And schoolchildren interrupt their studies for the day because it is stated: “The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart” (Psalms 19:9). Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even read from a place in the Bible that he is unaccustomed to reading, nor may one study from a place of the Talmud that he is unaccustomed to studying.

In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.8.32-33?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:32-33</a> it says they rested for three days and on the fourth were ready to count the donations they brought for the Temple.

At first glance, it seems as though Ezra heard this a very short time after his arrival. Ezra makes an impassioned prayer to Hashem in public, begging for forgiveness, which leads to many people gathering around him, attempting to repent. Subsequently, all the Jews in the land are commanded to arrive within three days' time to Yerushalayim. This is stated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.10.7-9?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:7-9</a> to have happened in the twentieth of the ninth month (four months after he arrived in Yerushalayim)!

I don't think it's accidental that this concept is introduced in the very same verses you are asking about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ezra 9:1-2;</strong></p>\n<p>א.\nוּכְכַלּ֣וֹת אֵ֗לֶּה נִגְּשׁ֨וּ אֵלַ֤י הַשָּׂרִים֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר\nלֹֽא־נִבְדְּל֞וּ הָעָ֤ם יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ וְהַכֹּהֲנִ֣ים וְהַלְוִיִּ֔ם\nמֵעַמֵּ֖י הָאֲרָצ֑וֹת כְּ֠תוֹעֲבֹֽתֵיהֶם לַכְּנַעֲנִ֨י הַחִתִּ֜י\nהַפְּרִזִּ֣י הַיְבוּסִ֗י הָֽעַמֹּנִי֙ הַמֹּ֣אָבִ֔י הַמִּצְרִ֖י\nוְהָאֱמֹרִֽי׃</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Now when these things were done, the princes drew near\nunto me, saying: 'The people of Israel, and the priests and the\nLevites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands,\ndoing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the\nHittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,\nthe Egyptians, and the Amorites.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ב.\nכִּֽי־נָשְׂא֣וּ מִבְּנֹֽתֵיהֶ֗ם לָהֶם֙ וְלִבְנֵיהֶ֔ם וְהִתְעָֽרְבוּ֙ <strong>זֶ֣רַע הַקֹּ֔דֶשׁ</strong> בְּעַמֵּ֖י הָאֲרָצ֑וֹת וְיַ֧ד הַשָּׂרִ֣ים\nוְהַסְּגָנִ֗ים הָֽיְתָ֛ה בַּמַּ֥עַל הַזֶּ֖ה רִאשׁוֹנָֽה׃</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for\ntheir sons; so that the <strong>holy seed</strong> have mingled themselves with the\npeoples of the lands; yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath\nbeen first in this faithlessness.'</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will now give my personal opinion and thus I am the only source. It's my belief that Ezra didn't \"notice,\" or take action sooner because intermarrying the locals had <em>somehow</em> not caused widespread sin and debauchery. We don't get any public complaints in Tanakh of these intermarried exiles offering sacrifices to pagan Gods, or having idols inside their houses, going to \"high places,\" or eating unclean animals, etc. It seems like these \"local\" wives and husbands though of non Israelite/Judean stock were willing to either practice Judaism on some level, or at least not corrupt their Israelite spouses to idolatry. Therefore Ezra wouldn't necessarily notice things are amiss, because everyone is acting more or less like they should be. It's also likely that the local Samaritan/Ammonite/Egyptian/Hittite looked very similar to a Judean, so it wouldn't be visually obvious that a couple was intermarried.</p>\n<p>But then Ezra is \"informed,\" that all these people have intermarried and have \"mingled\" the <strong>holy seed</strong> with the peoples of the lands. These informers also say that abominations are happening.... but no evidence is actually presented. So it is my opinion that the issue of intermarriage wasn't necessarily one of paganism, or idolatry, but rather one of \"racial purity.\" Keep in mind that while racial purity may not matter greatly for a common Israelite/Judean, the same can't be said for the priestly class, the levitical class, and potentially for the descendants of Dawid as princes.</p>\n<p>This potentially explains why these informers also emphasize that the \"The people of Israel, and the <strong>priests and the Levites</strong>, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands...yea, the hand of the <strong>princes and rulers</strong> hath been first in this faithlessness.\"</p>\n<p>And perhaps this sheds light on why a council needed to be appointed to seek all these intermarriages out, because otherwise these intermarriages might fly under the radar for generations. This would run the risk of destroying the legitimacy of the priesthood, the levites, and the descendents of Dawid within just a few more generations. So if the idea is that racial purity must be maintained for these classes, it's understandable why Ezra needed to be informed, and why he might take so drastic a measure as sending away all the wives and children, even those of normal Israelites/Judeans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/120280/9045\">Another answer here</a> makes the argument that it's possible Ezra didn't believe in conversion. This idea has merits worth contemplating as the author points out that Ezra and his court didn't try to convert these foreign spouses, instead insisting that they must all be sent away, without exception. This seems odd when you consider an average Israelite is allowed to marry converts, so why not convert these spouses? My response is: Because maybe it wasn't a question of whether or not Ezra believed in conversion <em>in general</em>, but maybe the question is whether Ezra believed that Priests, Levites, and Princes could marry a convert from Moabites/Hittites/Egyptians/Amorites/Samaritans/etc.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Nothing in my answer is an attempt to extol, justify, or even critique the idea of racial purity. It is my opinion that Ezra and his informers were motivated by racial purity, but I leave it up to you the reader to decide what you think about racial purity as a concept.</em></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=20129#p=299&fitMode=fitwidth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Doros Harishonim (vol. 2, pp. 653</a>ff) discusses this. He first makes a couple of background points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The \"sarim\" who inform Ezra are actually the national Sanhedrin (the nucleus, if not the totality, of the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah), which he had re-established from among the group he had led from Babylonia. (Note that the \"sarim\" in v. 1 accuse the \"sarim\" in v. 2 of being among the most prominent of the intermarriers; the first are the Torah sages, the second the local noblemen.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The regional government and the (Jewish) lords didn't care much, if any, about halachah. So even though there were local batei dinim in the various towns, they lacked power to enforce their rulings. That was why the king's rescript (Ezra 7:12ff), granting Ezra and his group official government backing, was crucial. (The governors and nobles and their minions also had government backing, so it wasn't necessarily possible to force them to obey Ezra and the Sanhedrin, but at least now they couldn't interfere with its operations.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The four months, then, were spent in getting the national Sanhedrin up and running, and familiarizing themselves with the local conditions. Once that was done, lines of communication were opened between the local batei dinim and the Sanhedrin (either the former came and reported to the latter, or the opposite - the members of the Sanhedrin started traveling around the towns), and the first item on the agenda was about the intermarriages (which had indeed been going on for some time, but which the local batei dinim had hitherto had no ability to prevent). The Sanhedrin in turn promptly informed Ezra, and he and they were then able to make things happen using a combination of Ezra's moral suasion (making a public spectacle, to get the people themselves to realize that this needs to be corrected) and the Sanhedrin's temporal power (to force everyone to attend the meeting).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It took Ezra a while because he came from Persia as \"King's eye\" and he probably needed approval from the Great King [of Persia] before he could act. When he learned that conversion did not exist in Judaism, as it did not in Zoroastrianism, from which he was very familiar, he told the Jews to send away their non-Judean wives. He was against intermarriage because the practice of conversion simply didn't exist. If conversion existed, they would have converted.</p>\n\n\n",

Yet we are also taught to cry to Hashem during times of suffering, depression, sorrow, mourning, etc. Is the Shechinah present when one has no simcha in their heart?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If exile, i.e. the forcible uprooting of a people, qualifies as a time of sorrow and difficulty, then there are a several instances where it writes that the Shechinah accompanies the Jews when they are exiled.</p>\n<p>Firstly, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.12.40.1?vhe=Mekhilta_--_Wikisource&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta 12:40</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן את מוצא בכל מקום שגלו שכינה עמהם. גלו למצרים שכינה עמהם, שנאמר הנגלה נגליתי אל בית אביך בהיותם במצרים (שמואל א ב'). גלו לבבל שכינה עמהן, שנאמר ושמתי כסאי בעילם (ירמיה מט). גלו לאדום שכינה עמהן, שנאמר מי זה בא מאדום חמוץ בגדים מבצרה (ישעיה סג). וכשעתידין לחזור, כביכול שכינה עמהן. שנאמר ושב ה' אלהיך (דברים ל) אינו אומר והשיב אלא ושב. ואומר אתי מלבנון כלה (שיר השירים ד) וכי מלבנון היא באה, והלא מלבנון הוא עולה. כביכול אני ואת (ללבנון) עולים</p>\n<p>And thus do you find, that wherever they were exiled, the Shechinah was with them. They were exiled to Egypt — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.2.27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Samuel 2:27</a>) \"Did I not reveal Myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt?

(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.49.38?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 49:38</a>) \"and I set My throne in Eilam.\" They were exiled to Edom — the Shechinah was with them, viz.

This concept is based on Psalms 91,15: \"I will be with him in distress.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>More generally speaking, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.9.1.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Berachos 9:1</a> where it demonstrates that Hashem personally, as it were, comes to the aid of someone who is in distress.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רִבִּי יוּדָן אָמַר מִשְּׁמֵיהּ דִּידֵיהּ בָּשָׂר וְדָם יֵשׁ לוֹ פַּטְרוֹן. <strong>אִם בָּאָת לוֹ עֵת צָרָה</strong> אֵינוֹ נִכְנַס אֶצְלוֹ פִּתְאוֹם. אֶלָּא בָּא וְעָמַד עַל פִּתְחוֹ שֶׁל פַּטְרוֹנוֹ וְקוֹרֵא לְעַבְדּוֹ אוֹ לְבֵן בֵּיתוֹ וְהוּא אוֹמֵר אִישׁ פְּלוֹנִי עוֹמֵד עַל פֶּתַח חֲצֵירָךְ. שֶׁמָּא מַכְנִיסוֹ וְשֶׁמָּא מַנִּיחוֹ. <strong>אֲבָל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא אֵינוֹ כֵן אִם בָּאָה עַל אָדָם צָרָה לֹא יְצַווַח לֹא לְמִיכָאֵל וְלֹא לְגַבְרִיאֵל אֶלָּא לִי יְצַווַח וַאֲנִי עוֹנֶה לוֹ מִיַּד</strong> הָהוּא דִּכְתִיב כָּל אֲשֶׁר יִקְרָא בְּשֵׁם ה יְמַלֵּט.</p>\n<p>Rebbi Yudan said in his own name: Flesh and blood has a protector. <strong>If someone is in distress</strong>, he does not enter the protector’s place suddenly but rather stands at his door and calls his slave or member of the household and that one will say: \"Ploni is standing at the door of your courtyard.\" Perhaps he will make him enter, maybe he will let him stand. <strong>But the Holy One, praise to Him, is not like this: If a person is in distress, he should cry neither to Michoel nor to Gavriel, rather he should cry to Me and I shall answer him immediately</strong>; that is what is written (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joel.3.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoel 3:5</a>): “Every one who calls on the name of G-d will escape.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Are there any guidelines or sources as to how to attenuate those unkind motives which will enhance one's attitude towards others and make one's speech more kindly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Judaism isn't as overtly focused over negative thoughts like some other religions are. The Christians follow a Rabbi who says that someone who murders in their heart or commits adultery in their heart is guilty of the actual thing. Judaism as a whole is not willing to take this stance. Thinking about murder is definitely different than murder itself, since one causes no harm outside the self and the other ends a life. But I believe Judaism still has a concept of the place you let your mind go will eventually be the place your mind spends most of its time. If you let yourself have unchecked fleeting thoughts of adultery, you will eventually have unchecked periodic thoughts of adultery, and then possibly frequent thoughts of adultery. This is not ideal and there is value in trying to prevent your mind from regularly going to such negative places unchecked.</p>\n<p>For me, these kind of negative thoughts occur most often when I'm driving in LA. Someone cuts me off, or does something legitimately dangerous and I might have a momentary thought about that person that is terrible. So I apologize to God, in English. Because I know that the more often you let yourself \"go there\" guilt free, the more likely you will keep \"going there.\"</p>\n<p>Another common situation is when I have negative thoughts toward how someone dresses. So I take another moment to apologize to God for judging how a person is dressing, rather than doing the right thing and judging myself for how I looked at them and my emotional response to them. The only one responsible for where my eyes go is me, not someone else.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hutner says that the foundational <em>issur</em> of <em>lashon ha'ra</em> is judging unfavourable (<em>dan le'kaf chov</em>).</p>\n<p>The <em>lashon ha'ra</em> is an expression of the negative evaluation that you have attributed to the person whom you have judged unfavourably.</p>\n<p>So the basic <em>issur</em> of <em>lashon ha'ra</em> is to construe someone else as having negative value.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, one who takes great pride in his deeds and boasts and preens himself always with the shame of his companions, and seeks to obtain honor through his companion's disgrace, such a man is like one who fills a barrel with fine wine, but there is in the bottom of the barrel a little hole. There is no doubt that all of the fine wine will be lost because of the small hole, if he does not stop it up. So this man who is arrogant, even though he is filled with Torah, will lose everything through this evil quality if he does not hasten to repair it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see from Orchos Tzaddikim that our whole Torah observance is predicated on tikkun hamiddos. It is not necessarily a mitzvah in isolation, but is the basis through which we are able to grow spiritually through the prism of mitzvos and the like.</p>\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.35.4?vhe=Moreh_Nevuchim,_translated_by_Ibn_Tibon&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim 3:35</a> without specifying exactly what they actually are, classes a whole group of mitzvos based on rectifying middos. So again, it is not its own mitzvah but a vital quality for mitzvah performance. He write there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הכלל השלישי כולל ה'מצוות' התלויות בתיקון המידות</strong> והם אשר ספרנום ב\"הלכות דעות\". וידוע שבטוב המדות תשלם חברת בני אדם וקיבוציהם אשר הוא הכרחי לסידור עניני בני אדם:</p>\n<p><strong>The third class is formed by commandments which are connected with the improvement of the moral condition [of mankind]; these are mentioned in Hilkot de‘ot</strong>. It is known that by a good moral state those social relations, which are indispensable for the well-being of mankind, are brought to perfection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once again, it would seem that it is not necessarily an inherent mitzvah but rather a pre-requisite for spiritual growth. If we want to grow in our levels of holiness and get close to G-d then it can only come through rectifying and improving our own character failings.</p>\n<p>This too is echoed by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Leviticus%2C_Shmini.15.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sfas Emes on Shemini 15:2</a> where he notes that the Jewish people, prior to Matan Torah had to spend time fixing their middos and purifying themselves so that they were in a fit state to receive the Torah. Again, it would seem that it is a crucial step to practising mitzvos but not a mitzvah in its own right.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Moshe's exact month of birth\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a recent shiur, the Rav said that Moshe told Yehoshua to pick men to fight Amalek.  The reason appears in the following passage:</p>\n<p>למה ליהושע, כדי שיבחר אנשים שנולדו באדר שני כמותו</p>\n<p>On the source sheet, it says that this פרוש comes from the Midrash Torah Shleimah, which I've never heard of before.</p>\n<p>Was Moshe A'H really born in Adar Sheni?  I always thought that Moshe was born in Adar Rishon and niftar in Adar Sheni.  Please clarify.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This comes from Midrash VeHizhir <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38577&st=&pgnum=83\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (num. 3).</p>\n<p>(What was given in the source sheet might’ve/should’ve been “מדרש, תורה שלמה” = ‘[a] Midrash’ cited in ‘Torah Shelemah’ by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Kasher</a>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Let me start my Answer by explaining that It's not possible  Moshe could have been born on 'אדר א and be niftar on 'אדר ב, for two simple reasons #1. Moshe Rabbinu was niftar at 120 years old. #2 He lived a complete (full) number of years. (Meaning he passed away after a full 120 years to the day of his birth (on ז' אדר). If Moshe passed on 'אדר ב that would be an un- full 121 years.</p>\n<p>Perhaps what you always thought,  (And some Midrashim do in fact say-  (it's a Machlos)  was that Moshe was born on a Regular ז  אדר  and he was niftar on a \"Leap Year\" with an אדר ב, and he passed on 'ז' אדר ב. That's considered \"A Full 120 years\" (As the  שולחן עורך brings down the Halacha by a Bar Mitzva. A kid born Reg. Adar who turns 13 on a Leap Year becomes a Bar Mitzvah on the 2nd Adar. Interestingly, this case works the opposite way as well.)</p>\n<p>Now, the bottom line is that it's an Argument when Moshe died.The Pasuk.  in V'Zot HaBerachah at Moshe's passing says: וַיִּבְכּוּ֩ בְנֵ֨י יִשְׂרָאֵ֧ל אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֛ה בְּעַֽרְבֹ֥ת מוֹאָ֖ב שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים י֑וֹם וַֽיִּתְּמ֔וּ יְמֵ֥י בְכִ֖י אֵ֥בֶל מֹשֶֽׁה׃</p>\n<p>Some Midrasim explain: After his death that Beni Yisrael mourned for Moshe Rabbinu for 30 days,  and then had Hespedim for him for another 30 days, totalling 60 days in which case Moshe passed on  a Leap Year on אדר ב.    Other Midrashem hold they Mourned for 30 days ( Hespid included in that time), and he passed on  a Regular אדר.</p>\n<p>Now, According to this Midrash VeHizhir that \"Oliver\" brought and \"Double AA\" found out was brought down by Rabbi M. Kasher who wrote a \"Likud\" (gathering) of various Midrashim, in his Sefer titled Torah Sheleima, that your Rav told you about, were it says that Moshe picked Yehoshua to help him lift his hands so Beni Yisrael will be victorious over Amalek, because they were both born on אדר ב, then the Midrash VeHizhir can hold either way.      Either that Moshe died on a Regular ז אדר  or on a \"עיבור שנה\" (Leap Year) on 'ז' אדר ב.</p>\n<p>Hope I helped. Good Shabbos.\nP.S.

These are prohibited as shaatnez. Yet, in the case of the hides used for the covering of the Mishkan, we find that non-kosher types are not allowed to be used. Why here is something treif required?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This really is not unexpected that something that is the choicest material and is used in the service of God is not allowed to be used by normal people for everyday use. For example the blood and fats of animals (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.3.16?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 3:16-17</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִקְטִירָ֥ם הַכֹּהֵ֖ן הַמִּזְבֵּ֑חָה לֶ֤חֶם אִשֶּׁה֙ לְרֵ֣יחַ נִיחֹ֔חַ כָּל־חֵ֖לֶב לַיהוָֽה׃\nחֻקַּ֤ת עוֹלָם֙ לְדֹרֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם בְּכֹ֖ל מֽוֹשְׁבֹתֵיכֶ֑ם כָּל־חֵ֥לֶב וְכָל־דָּ֖ם לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ׃</p>\n<p>The priest shall turn these into smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire, of pleasing odor. All fat is the LORD’s.\nIt is a law for all time throughout the ages, in all your settlements: you must not eat any fat or any blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See Ibn Ezra ibid.)</p>\n<p>While the reason for not wearing shaatnez is not revealed, and may not be because of its use in the Mishkan and priestly garments, the exception can be understood in this context.\nFurthermore, there is an exception to shaatnez even for a layman in the performance of a mitzva (before Rabbinic prohibition), to put Techeiles made of wool on a linen garment (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.3b.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 3b-4a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא תעשה גרידא מנלן דדחי דכתיב (דברים כב, יא) לא תלבש שעטנז גדילים תעשה לך</p>\n<p>with regard to a prohibition for which one is punished by lashes alone, from where do we derive that a positive mitzva overrides it? As it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds of wool and linen together. You shall make for yourself twisted fringes on the four corners of your covering with which you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12). These verses teach that despite the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds of wool and linen, it is permitted to prepare ritual fringes of diverse kinds, e.g., sky-blue dyed threads of wool on linen garments. This shows that the positive mitzva of ritual fringes overrides the prohibition of diverse kinds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As is written in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.11a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 11a</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Since Shmuel HaKatan and his great piety were mentioned, the Gemara now relates several incidents that shed additional light on his personality. The Sages taught: <strong>After the last of the prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, died, the Divine Spirit of prophetic revelation departed from the Jewish people</strong>. But nevertheless, they were still utilizing a Divine Voice, which they heard as a kind of echo of prophecy. One time, a group of Sages were reclining in the loft of the house of Gurya in Jericho, and a Divine Voice was bestowed upon them from Heaven, saying: There is one here who is fit for <strong>the Divine Presence to rest upon him as it rested upon Moses our teacher, but his generation is not deserving of this distinction. The Sages set their eyes upon Hillel the Elder, trusting that he was the one indicated by the Divine Voice</strong>. And when he died, the Sages said about him: Alas, the pious man, alas, the humble man, a disciple of Ezra. The baraita continues: Another time, a group of Sages were reclining in the loft in Yavne, and a Divine Voice was bestowed upon them from Heaven, saying: There is one here who is fit for <strong>the Divine Presence to rest upon him in prophecy, but his generation is not deserving of this distinction. The Sages set their eyes upon Shmuel HaKatan</strong>.

The class was about prophecies that <em>predicted the leaving of the Shechinah</em> from the Temple and hence from the Land of Israel. Based on what the sages tell us, we may infer that these prophecies also predicted the disappearance of prophecy, too. There are thus three such prophecies in Tanach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.6.1-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the year that King Uzziah died, I beheld my Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; and the skirts of His robe filled the Temple. Seraphs stood in attendance on Him. Each of them had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his legs, and with two he would fly. And one would call to the other, “Holy, holy, holy! The LORD of Hosts! His presence fills all the earth!” The doorposts would shake at the sound of the one who called, and the House kept filling with smoke. I cried, “Woe is me; I am lost! For I am a man of unclean lips And I live among a people Of unclean lips; Yet my own eyes have beheld The King LORD of Hosts.” Then one of the seraphs flew over to me with a live coal, which he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. He touched it to my lips and declared, “Now that this has touched your lips, Your guilt shall depart And your sin be purged away.” Then I heard the voice of my Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me.” And He said, “Go, say to that people: ‘Hear, indeed, but do not understand; See, indeed, but do not grasp.’ Dull that people’s mind, Stop its ears, And seal its eyes— Lest, seeing with its eyes And hearing with its ears, It also grasp with its mind, And repent and save itself.” I asked, “How long, my Lord?” And He replied: “Till towns lie waste without inhabitants And houses without people, And the ground lies waste and desolate— For the LORD will banish the population— And deserted sites are many In the midst of the land. “But while a tenth part yet remains in it, it shall repent. It shall be ravaged like the terebinth and the oak, of which stumps are left even when they are felled: its stump shall be a holy seed.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is of course a very famous prophecy, one of the main reasons being that it's part of our daily prayers. However, in context, its meaning is different than the way it's used in prayer. In prayer it's used to sanctify Hashem. In Tanachic context, however, it's describing one of the greatest catastrophes in Jewish history, which is Hashem's presence leaving the Temple and Israel. For this reason, rather than simply being awestruck at the sight, Isaiah cries out in mourning: \"Woe is me!\". Rabbi Bin-Nun explained that though the term \"ושוליו מלאים את ההיכל\" in modern Hebrew is understood as referring to the corners of Hashem or His clothing filling the Temple, in ancient Hebrew it actually refers to His base, i.e., Isaiah was watching Hashem launch out of the Temple like a rocket (metaphor used by the rabbi).</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Amos.9.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Amos 9:1</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I saw my LORD standing by the altar, and He said: Strike the capitals so that the thresholds quake, and make an end of the first of them all. And I will slay the last of them with the sword; not one of them shall escape, and not one of them shall survive.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason Amos saw Hashem stand by the altar and not sitting in the Holy of Holies was because, just like Isaiah, he was seeing Him exiting the Holy of Holies, and just before leaving the Temple, He stopped, turned to Amos, and told him of the coming days.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.8.1-11.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ezekiel Ch. 8-11</a> (it's long, so I'll bring only select verses):</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting at home, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, and there the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me. As I looked, there was a figure that had the appearance of fire: from what appeared as his loins down, [he was] fire; and from his loins up, his appearance was resplendent and had the color of amber...And the Presence of the God of Israel appeared there, like the vision that I had seen in the valley...Now the Presence of the God of Israel had moved from the cherub on which it had rested to the platform of the House...Now the cherubs were standing on the south side of the House when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court. But when the Presence of the LORD moved from the cherubs to the platform of the House, the House was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the radiance of the Presence of the LORD...And when they moved, each could move in the direction of any of its four quarters; they did not veer as they moved. The [cherubs] moved in the direction in which one of the heads faced, without turning as they moved...The cherubs ascended...Whenever the cherubs went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubs lifted their wings to ascend from the earth, the wheels did not roll away from their side...Then the Presence of the LORD left the platform of the House and stopped above the cherubs. And I saw the cherubs lift their wings and rise from the earth, with the wheels beside them as they departed; and they stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the House of the LORD, with the Presence of the God of Israel above them...The Presence of the LORD ascended from the midst of the city and stood on the hill east of the city...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ezekiel tells us of the most detailed version of the same sight seen by Isaiah and Amos<sup>1</sup>, that of Hashem's Presence leaving Israel; Ezekiel describes a gradual ascent: First Hashem leaves the inner court, then He leaves the Temple, then He leaves Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>However, this does not mean that future prophets cannot be expected. Prophecy hinges upon the return of the Shechinah; when that happens, we can expect the return of prophecy, b\"h.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Someone told me once that the more detailed a highly mystical prophecy is, the lower the prophetic level the prophecy was given on was (because the more spiritual something is, the harder it is to put into words). On the other hand, I read somewhere or heard somewhere that as Ezekiel was one of the last two prophets of the First Temple period (along with Jeremiah), he experienced the dying spasms of prophecy, which were very powerful, and for this merited to have these kinds of prophecies (it's also noteworthy about Ezekiel that many of his prophecies begin with the special term \"son of man\". As for Jeremiah, Jeremiah's prophecies echoed just about all of the prophets who came before him. He paraphrases many of them).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>During the time of the Second Temple, the Sages of the Great Assembly saw that the people's ability to resist the temptation for idol worship was weakening, and realized that if the pattern continued, there would come a point when it would be all but impossible to resist. In order to avoid this situation, they prayed to G-d that he should remove the temptation for idol worship from the world, and G-d agreed to do so.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.64a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 64a</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vilna_Gaon_on_Seder_Olam_Rabbah.30.2.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Gr\"a in his commentary on Seder Olam Raba</a> says that as a \"side effect\" of removing the inclination towards idol worship, G-d also removed the spirit of prophecy from the world.</p>\n<p>I have learned (thought I don't have a source offhand) that this is because the temptation towards evil and towards good must be relatively evenly balanced, otherwise humans don't really have free choice and they can't get any credit for their decisions. If G-d's word, in the form of prophecy, was readily available, yet the temptation for evil was reduced, <em>of course</em> nobody would sin, and therefore people wouldn't be able to get reward for their positive deeds.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11310/no-yetzer-hora-of-idolatry-so-no-nevuah/11318#11318\">this question from Mi Yodeya</a></p>\n\n\n",

Once Melchizedek, traditionally identified as Shem, placed the blessing of Abraham before the blessing of the Omnipresent, He had the priesthood emerge from Abraham in particular, and not from any other descendant of Shem. As it is stated: “And he blessed him and said: Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, and blessed be God the Most High” (Genesis 14:19–20). Abraham said to him: And does one place the blessing of the servant before the blessing of his master? You should have blessed God first. Immediately the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave the priesthood to Abraham, as it is stated: “The Lord says to my lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool” (Psalms 110:1), and afterward it is written: “The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: you shall be a priest forever, because you are a king of righteousness [al divrati malki tzedek]” (Psalms 110:4), which is explained homiletically to mean: Due to the improper words [divrati] of Melchizedek, the offspring of Abraham shall be priests of God forever.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the War of the Four and Five Kings, Malkitzedek first blessed Avraham and only then Hashem, and for this he lost his priesthood (as the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.121b.8?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamot 121b</a> says: \"the Holy One, Blessed be He, is exacting with His surroundings, i.e., the righteous who are close to Him, up to a hairsbreadth\"), which was then given to Avraham.

    "content": "# Parshas Zachor during Mincha reading?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was told about a synagogue where they had a second reading of Parshas Zachor during the reading for Mincha with the following procedure: The first two aliyos are read normally, and for the third aliya (people are told to be mechaven for Zachor) the blessing is said and the normal portion is read, then the Sefer is rolled from where it is to Zachor, the reading is continued there and the final blessing is said. This is done during the regular Mincha. Supposedly, this procedure is approved by Rav Avigdor Neventzal, the Rav of the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>I find this procedure very difficult to accept, and question if it really was said by Rav Neventzal. This approach is directly against two halachos in Shulchan Aruch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.144.1?lang=bi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 144:1</a></p>\n<p>מדלגין בנביא ואין מדלגין בתורה מפרשה זו לפרשה אחרת והני מילי בשני עניינים דחיישינן שמא תתבלבל דעת השומעים</p>\n<p>We skip in the Prophets, but we do not skip in the Torah from one section to another section. And these words are regarding two subjects where we are worried that perhaps the mind of the listeners will be confused,</p>\n<p>144:3</p>\n<p>אין גוללין ס\"ת בצבור מפני כבוד הצבור ואם אין להם אלא ס\"ת אחד והם צריכים לקרות בשני עניינים גוללים וידחה כבוד הצבור:</p>\n<p>It is not proper to roll the Torah scroll in the presence of the congregation, so as to honor the congregation. And if they only have a single Torah scroll and they have to read two portions they may roll, and they defer the honor of the congregation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To clarify the second issue, while (apparently) some of the congregation (let's even say some of the men) still need to hear Zachor, the congregation as a whole does not. How is the honor of the congregation pushed off for the need of the individuals? (If the only ones who need to hear Zachor are women, that can only make the issue worse.)</p>\n<p>Can anyone 1) explain how this is not in conflict with both or either of these halachos, or 2) confirm that any notable Rabbi has ruled to follow this procedure?</p>\n\n\n",

They are referred to as <em>Counting (or quantification), Writing (or Sofrut ספרות)</em> and <em>Speaking.</em></p>\n<p>What this means is that proper and complete comprehension of Hebrew as found in the Holy writings encompasses the numerical meaning of the letters (<em>The Hebrew letters have numerical meaning. Numerical and mathematical transformations of all types give additional meaning and understanding to any text.</em>).</p>\n<p>Additionally, the form of the letters themselves, meaning how they are formed <em>both when they are engraved like in the Tablets of the 10 Commandments and when they are written with ink and pen</em> convey additional levels of understanding in terms of any text. This also relates to the traditions of large and small letters, reversed letters and other types of transformations pertaining to the form and shape of the letters and also the number and types of crowns found on different letters.</p>\n<p>And the third category is how the letters are pronounced and spoken. This encompasses both variations where the letters are written one way and the reading or pronunciation of the text is different and also in regard to what part of the mouth and throat the pronunciation of those letters originates from. Those which originate from the same part of the mouth are interchangeable. It also relates to the whole subject of <em>Nekudot</em>, which can be thought of as the vowels in Hebrew and <em>Ta'amim</em>, also known as <em>Trope</em>, which can be conceived of as a type of punctuation marks. But they also have a much deeper meaning relating to the flow of a given text. This too is a very large field of study unto itself. Also included in this division is the general subject of grammar, verbs and nouns as it relates to Hebrew.</p>\n<p>What follows in the translation of the Wikipedia link explains how these three categories of Counting, Writing and Speaking also correspond to the three divisions of the twenty-two letters themselves (22 corresponding to the 10 fingers and 10 toes for 20 total digits and the 2 general categories of fingers and toes. That 10 utterances in the first chapter of Bereshit (Bereshit 1:1-31) corresponds to the 10 commandments from the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people at Mount Sinai which is comprised of both the Written and Oral Torah תורה שבכתב ותורה שבעל פה.), the 3 <em>Amot</em> (which corresponds to the 3 times in the first chapter of Bereshit that it says ויעש אלהים, Bereshit 1:7, 16, 25), the 7 <em>Doubling Letters</em> (which corresponds to the 7 times in the first chapter of Bereshit that it says וירא אלהים, Bereshit 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31) and the 12 <em>Plain letters</em>, which corresponds with the 12 constellations and 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night.</p>\n<p>And the rest of Sefer Yetzirah goes into further explanation of all these arrangements and how they are the basis and model for the existence and structure of all of Creation.</p>\n\n\n",

Eliyahu Hatishbi confronts them with a proposal that they will test who is the accurate God, and give an offering, if their offering is received then, they are correct.

    "content": "# Does the Talmud say that Jesus writhes in excrement and Mary was a prostitute?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a widespread belief among many Christian denominations that Jesus and Mary are referred to in overly disrespectful, even scatological, language in the Talmud.

One of these is a man called \"יש\"ו\"/\"Jesus\":</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene<sup>1</sup> from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12). Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world. As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, there is indeed a story in the Talmud about a man called Jesus being burned in excrement. However, there are multiple stories in the Talmud in which a man called \"Jesus\" is mentioned, and not all stories perfectly line up together, and also not necessarily with the figure known as \"the historical Jesus\" (that they don't fit with the NT is of less consequence to Judaism). As such, there are those that believe that none of these stories refer to the same Jesus, like Rabbi Gil Student in the <a href=\"http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/jesusnarr.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link</a> that @TurkHill brought, or only a couple of them. There are those that disagree, however, and say that at least some of the stories refer to the same Jesus, and perhaps even all of the stories can be connected together.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharal of Prague</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Netzach_Yisrael.5.59?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wrote</a> on this story in his book Netzach Yisrael. His version has some variants to our edition of the Talmud, most notably that in his version the Jesus mentioned in Gittin is not called \"Jesus\" but \"Hahu Gavra\", \"that man\", which is a long-in-use Jewish term for the famous Jesus. This is likely the result of censorship - the Church sought to censor all mentions of Jesus in the Talmud, on the basis of anti-Christian polemics. The result would be editing references to Jesus or even completely editing out whole portions of the Talmud.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.104b.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat 104b</a> it says:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was taught in a baraita that Rabbi Eliezer said to the Rabbis: Didn’t the infamous ben Stada take magic spells out of Egypt in a scratch on his flesh? They said to him: He was a fool, and you cannot cite proof from a fool. That is not the way that most people write. [An addition from the missing portions of the Talmud: Incidentally, the Gemara asks: Why did they call him ben Stada, when he was the son of Pandeira? Rav Ḥisda said: His mother’s husband, who acted as his father, was named Stada, but the one who had relations with his mother and fathered him was named Pandeira. The Gemara asks: Wasn’t his mother’s husband Pappos ben Yehuda? Rather, his mother was named Stada and he was named ben Stada after her. The Gemara asks: But wasn’t his mother Miriam, who braided women’s hair? The Gemara explains: That is not a contradiction. Rather, Stada was merely a nickname, as they say in Pumbedita: This one strayed [setat da] from her husband.]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This story tells of this Miriam person who cheated on her husband, Pappos ben Yehuda, with a man named Pandeira, and this resulted in the birth of a man nicknamed \"ben Stada\", who brought witchcraft to Judea.</p>\n<p>Like in the previous story, some think this story refers to Jesus. One reason is that in the Aramaic, \"Miriam who braided women's hair\" is מרים מגדלא שיער נשיא - \"Miriam megadla se'ar neshia\", which sounds an awful lot like Mary Magdalene.</p>\n<p>Another reason is because of the version of this story that's brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.67a.14-15?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 67a</a>, which is one of the Talmudic sections that was clearly censored by the Church:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"[an addition from the missing portions of the Talmud: And the court did the same to an inciter named ben Setada, from the city of Lod, and they hanged him on Passover eve. The Gemara asks: Why did they call him ben Setada, when he was the son of Pandeira? Rav Ḥisda says: Perhaps his mother’s husband, who acted as his father, was named Setada, but his mother’s paramour, who fathered this mamzer, was named Pandeira. The Gemara challenges: But his mother’s husband was Pappos ben Yehuda, not Setada. Rather, perhaps his mother was named Setada, and he was named ben Setada after her. The Gemara challenges: But his mother was Miriam, who braided women’s hair. The Gemara explains: That is not a contradiction; Setada was merely a nickname, as they say in Pumbedita: This one strayed [setat da] from her husband.]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, in this version, ben Stada was hanged on Passover Eve, which is another connection to the NT Jesus.</p>\n<p>A third reason is a parallel story in the Talmud, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.43a.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 43a</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...from the outset, before the accused is convicted, he does not go out. The Gemara raises a difficulty: But isn’t it taught in a baraita: On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene<sup>2</sup> after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus [the Nazarene]<sup>1</sup> is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see here that was a man called Jesus who was also put to death on Passover Eve on the charge of, among other things, witchcraft, much like ben Stada. The Talmud in Sanhedrin then brings another story about the trial of five students of this Jesus: Mattai, Nakai, Netzer, Buni, and Toda.</p>\n<p>Some have speculated parallels between these five and characters in the NT. Mattai is of course similar to Matthew. Netzer is similar to Nazarene (especially in Hebrew where they have the same root letters - נצר (Netzer)). Nakai might be Nicodemus. Buni might be Barnabas. Toda might be Thaddeus.</p>\n<p>But like with the story in Gittin, there are those that disagree with this interpretation. They may say that this might be a figurative tale in the Talmud, or perhaps it tells of another such sectarian with the same name, or perhaps by the time the Talmud was written, the name \"Jesus\" was a generic name for \"bad man\", or that Mary Magdalene wasn't even Jesus's mother, and so forth.</p>\n<p>To conclude, the Talmud is vague in these stories. Whether on purpose or not - we can't be sure. Who these stories refer to - that's open to debate, much like how it's being debated to this day how much of the NT is reliable (in particular considering contradictions between the Gospels).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> So in MS. Vatican 130. Other textual witnesses in the Genizah website are either too badly preserved, simply have \"ישו\" or were censored and have \"ההוא גברא\" (<a href=\"https://jel.jewish-languages.org/words/1514\" rel=\"noreferrer\">that man</a>) instead.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> So in MSS.

One Lubavitcher Rabbi I listened to [ I believe it was Rabbi Mendel Kaplan ] stated [ Paraphrasing ] that the reason behind their garb was simply to not be like the others, and if the gentiles were to adopt wholesale their current style, they would again have to change. In this sense, G-d commands the Jews to have a sort of antagonism with the nations of the world who would wish to have them assimilate into their societies.</li>\n<li><strong>Historical</strong><br>History as it is taught by Jews [ in my experience, consuming virtually every history class found at Chabad.org ], focusses on what you can call perpetual periods of Christian Persecution against them while in diaspora, with brief respites here and there, to the point of ad nauseum. It does well to both villainize and to paint Christians as sanctimonious selfish unenlightened ignorant barbarians. There is no attempt to rationalize the behaviour of the alleged persecutors, thus implanting an antagonism.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What is going on in the text?</h2>\n<p><strong>Pre-Context Added</strong><br>\nThe Talmud in general approaches Christianity with a very puzzled and curious demeanour, something akin to mystical cult that probably amounts to nothing in particular. [ Even Rabbi Gamliel in the New Testament, testifies as such, preferring to take a wait and see approach with Christianity, not particularly concerned that it will amount to anything. ]</p>\n<p>The talmud states that the Christians were capable of various sorceries, and that its followers words could have an intoxicating quality which they should be wary of. Even when it rationalizes the execution of Christians withholding mercy unto them [ During the Bar Kochba revolt ], it does not read like a screed, but just ordinary talmudic dialect.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Context Added</strong><br>\nThe Talmud becomes very much more of a screed, at least in this case. It really is a far stretch to suggest that Christ was using a euphamism for himself, because that defies a lot of common sense.</p>\n<p><strong>A plausible explanation:</strong><br>\nPre-Context, this passage <strong>suggests</strong> that Christ was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One who tickles the imagination and curiosity of the Jewish People. [ Why else would you summon him specifically? You could have summoned Hillel or Shammai for example. ]</li>\n<li>One who was capable of offering insight and wisdom. [ Why else would you ask him such important pertinent questions? ]</li>\n<li>One who was implied to not being in a sort of Hell, ergo having good favour in the afterlife, ergo a good omen to potential Christians.</li>\n<li>One who revered the Sages, suggesting he was a good and honourable Jewish Person.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Given the mentioned antagonisms, it would be scandalous for a Jewish student to stumble across this passage and be at all intrigued or ambivilant about what turned out to be the founder of the largest religon in history that is directly antagonistic towards Judaism as we know it today. As such, it is plausible steps were consciously or subconsciously taken much later by the various Rabbis to poison the well, by changing the context completely to have it suggest that Christ himself was burning in excrement.</p>\n<p>This way, no student reading this passage risks experiencing spiritual death by becoming a Christian.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Re: Mary</h2>\n<p>The simple answer is yes, but for any Christian offended by this, they omit or are ignorant of the narrative driven by the New Testament, [ and implicitly by G-d ] which is extremely cynical [ in the classical sense of the term ]. In short, Christ is a subversion to the romantic notion of a Messiah, to be the \"cornerstone that was rejected\". In order to amplify that to its absolute extreme, his origin story has to be plausibly ... of depraved and lowly origins, which is really the entirety of his ministry. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Born in a Manger [ absolute poverty alongside animals ].</li>\n<li>A Messiah who succeeds through failure ( Persecution ).</li>\n<li>One who wears a crown, but the crown is a crown of thorns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>etc.</p>\n<p>So to have anger directed towards the Jews at the time for the disrespect, one would be more appropriately directing that anger towards G-d, because he explicitly would have manufactured the conditions and circumstance that would lead people to plausibly believe that a woman baring a child out of wedlock was anything but a lascivious individual.</p>\n\n\n",

He treats of science, or composes hymns, exhorts his fellow-men, discusses political and theological problems; all this he does while awake, and in the full possession of his senses. Such a person is said to speak by the holy spirit. David composed the Psalms, and Solomon the Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon by this spirit; also Daniel, Job, Chronicles, and the rest of the Hagiographa were written in this holy spirit; therefore they are called ketubim (Writings, or Written), i.e., written by men inspired by the holy spirit.

They belonged to the class of men that spoke, inspired by the ruaḥ ha-kodesh, \"the holy spirit.\" Also in the order of the holy writings, no distinction is made between the books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Daniel, Psalms, Ruth, and Esther; they are all written by divine inspiration.

And that is because there are surely cases in which the prophet grasps content, but he is not restricted in the words; such that the prophet can say it with the words that he wants. <strong>But there are other cases in which they grasp content that that is also restricted by words, such as the prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other prophets that were written for [all] the generations. Those were restricted in their prophetic words to include many [simultaneous meanings]. And even in this, the metaphor varied according to the prophet's own understanding and his ways; and it even varies according to the nature of his language and his way of speaking.</strong> And frequently, prophets were given to do actions alongside their prophecies, such as Jeremiah with his belt (Jeremiah 13) and with his yoke (Jeremiah 27), Ezekiel with his brick (Ezekiel 4) and many others like those. And the content of this was that through these actions, they would arouse the higher powers that were required according to the true essence of what the prophecy - in all of its facets - was about. And then they would be prepared and stored to bring the thing out to be actualized at the time that was fit for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the prophecies come from G-d, and were dictated by him. They may even have more meanings than the prophet originally understood. To quote Ramchal again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible for a prophet to miss something included in his prophecy, but it is impossible for him to imagine that which was not [part of] it: Behold it is also possible that one of the prophets will grasp something true in his prophecy, but will not grasp all of the true things included in it. For example, [regarding] the prophecy of Jonah the son of Amittai, to whom it was stated (Jonah 3:4), \"and Nineveh will be overturned\" - two [possibly] true understandings were included in this statement: The first was that it was the punishment destined for them according to their sin; and the second was that what would [actually] happen to them was foreseen in front of Him, may He blessed - that is that they would overturn themselves from bad to good. However if only the matter of the punishment had been truly included in the statement, once the Holy One, blessed be He, came back and regretted the [punishment], He would have revealed the thing to the prophets, and especially to Jonah - that a new decree had come out besides the first one. But since the Holy One, blessed be He, truly included both understandings in the first statement, He did not need to make a new decree for them. Rather the statement would stand according to the second understanding, and not the first. However at the beginning, Jonah only grasped the first [understanding], and not the second. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 89b), \"It is Jonah that did not comprehend.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about the parts of Tanach that are not recordings of prophecies? The Talmud in Bava Basra is clear that the entire Pentateuch was dictated by G-d to Moses (though the last eight verses may have been dictated to Joshua.) The Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.7a.10?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah</a> is pretty clear that in order for a book to make it into Tanach, it must have been written with Divine Inspiration. Otherwise, even if it was written by King Solomon, the wisest of men, it is just a regular book. It also seems that we look at the entire book as being written on the same level, or else the discussion of Esther there does not make sense.</p>\n<p>So to go through your questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does \"inspired\" by God mean:\n(1) the same as written by God?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not necessarily, but sometimes yes. The recorded prophecies (including the entire Pentateuch) were written by G-d, but some parts of Nach were just written with \"inspiration.\" See Ramchal ad loc for more detail.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(2) a collaboration between people and God, each providing input, both authoritative? But why would God want a collaboration when it comes to laying down His instructions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They were either written with G-d's complete dictation, or were people prophetically relaying G-d's will. But the entire content was written with Divine assistance (and approval) throughout.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(3) that God said one thing but the scrivener wasn't always paying attention and may have written something else? Honest mistakes?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. See Ramchal above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(4) that scribal errors may have crept in over the centuries and we must find them and remove them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbis put major effort into keeping the text of Tanach accurate. They created an entire masoretic system to maintain the integrity of the text as much as possible. This ensures that the words and phrases are accurate, but there definitely are cases when we are not sure about the spelling of words, etc. The main book on the topic is Minchas Shai. The Jerusalem Talmud records cases of three authoritative scrolls that each had one word differences, and the Rabbis went with the majority.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(5) that some teachings have eternal value (that's God's part) and other teachings are transitional (that's the human part), and our task is to find which is which and, at the right time, remove the second according to the political correctness of the day?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Pentateuch is very clear that it contains the entire Torah of G-d, and nothing can be added or removed, ever. The other works of Nach were written to explain and clarify the Torah, and as such have the same validity and permanence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>There are a few more possibilities. It's possible that Moses meditated on nature and produced the Torah. It is also possible that the Torah was inspired by the experiences of the Israelites in Sinai. The Babylonian Talmud Megilla 7a seems to agree. It says the Book of Esther was composed with divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This is similar to some rabbis who feel the Oral Torah was developed in the spirit of the Torah. It was, in other words, \"divine inspiration.\" Similarly, Nachmanides felt that the patriarchs observed the Torah by divine inspiration.</p>\n<p>Was it divine inspiration? Does G-d inspire people to write the Tanakh? I think so.</p>\n\n\n",

It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן שִׁבְעָה קִפְּלוּ אֶת כָּל הָעוֹלָם כּוּלּוֹ מְתוּשֶׁלַח רָאָה אָדָם <strong>שֵׁם רָאָה מְתוּשֶׁלַח</strong> יַעֲקֹב רָאָה אֶת שֵׁם עַמְרָם רָאָה אֶת יַעֲקֹב אֲחִיָּה הַשִּׁילוֹנִי רָאָה אֶת עַמְרָם אֵלִיָּהוּ רָאָה אֶת אֲחִיָּה הַשִּׁילוֹנִי וַעֲדַיִין קַיָּים</p>\n<p>§ After discussing the generation of those who died in the wilderness, the Gemara mentions a tradition that relates to that generation. The Sages taught: Seven people spanned in their lifetimes the whole world in its entirety, i.e., their lives have spanned all of human history. Methuselah saw Adam in his lifetime; <strong>Shem saw Methuselah</strong>; Jacob saw Shem; Amram saw Jacob; Ahijah the Shilonite saw Amram; Elijah saw Ahijah the Shilonite; and Elijah is still alive.

Another example is that Avraham sent for Shem when he required bris milah (circumcision) and Shem performed the bris on both Avraham and his son Yishmael (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.80.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni, Bereishis 80</a>)</p>\n<p>Shem definitely outlived Avraham, and the Midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.61.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 62</a> mentions the fact that he helped bury him. The Midrash there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָן שֵׁם וְעֵבֶר הָיוּ מְהַלְּכִין לִפְנֵי מִטָּתוֹ וְרָאוּ גַּבָּהּ מָקוֹם מֻפְנֶה לְאָבִינוּ אַבְרָהָם וְקָבְרוּ אוֹתוֹ בִּדְיוֹטְרִין שֶׁלּוֹ בַּמָּקוֹם הַמּוּכָן וּמְזֻמָּן לוֹ</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shmuel son of Nachman said: Shem and Eiver were walking before his (Avraham's) bier, and they saw that the space (next to Sarah's grave) was free for Avraham, and they buried him in the spot that had been destined (lit. prepared) for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38103&st=&pgnum=119&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaGadol, Bereshis 11:11</a> definitively writes that he lived through a substantial part of Yitzchak's life too and the first third of Yaakov's life:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויחי שם - חיה שם עד שעבר מימי יצחק מאה ועשר שנים והיה יעקב באותו הפרק בן חמשים שנה ובאותו זמן מת שם בן נח</p>\n<p>And Shem lived - Shem lived until 110 year's of Yitzchak's life had passed, and Yaakov during this period was 50 years old, and at that time Shem the son of Noach died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to return to the question, yes - Shem lived in physical years for this amount of time, during which time he outlived Avraham, and lived whilst both Yitzchak and Yaakov were alive. The <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=628137&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=16140312972112102&pagenum=25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Hadoros HaKotzair p.7</a> places the year of birth at 1558 and his death at 2158.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Seder Olam sets up the timeline of the world based on the life spans as shown in the torah. The Torah says that Shem was 100 years old two years after the Flood and lived 500 years after that. Thus Shem actually lived 600 years (500 years after the birth of his first son).  The normal lifespan was then gradually reduced after the flood. Shem was 100 years old in 1658 and died in 2158. Avraham was born in 1948, Yitzchak in 2048, and Yaakov in 2108. Thus, Shem died when Yaakov was 50 years old, before Yaakov left his parents for the Yeshivah of Ever.</p>\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8171/showrashi/true#v3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 6:3</a> explains that the 120 years means the time until the flood was going to start.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>and his days shall be:</strong> Until a hundred and twenty years I will delay My wrath towards them, but if they do not repent, I will bring a\nflood upon them. Now if you ask: from the time that Japheth was born\nuntil the Flood are only a hundred years, [I will answer that] there\nis no [sequence of] earlier and later events in the Torah. This decree\nhad already been issued twenty years before Noah begot children, and\nso we find in Seder Olam (ch. 28). There are many Aggadic midrashim on\nthe words לֹא יָדוֹן, but this is its clear, simple explanation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The normal lifespan was reduced gradually after the flood.</p>\n\n\n",

If another Jew is committing suicide, would one still be obligated to save him because of this mitzvah? If so, to what level? (Derabannan or Deoraytah)</p>\n<p>Note: By all means, it is for sure pious to save someone from suicide. This question is just asking if one is obligated to do so because of this mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <em>Minchas Chinuch</em> (Mitzva 237) writes that the prohibition of לא תעמוד על דם רעך does not apply to a case of deliberate suicide.</p>\n<p>He proves this from a Gemara (Sanhedrin 73a), where the Gemara asks why it was necessary to explicitly prohibit לא תעמוד על דם רעך, if we could have reached this conclusion through a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudical_hermeneutics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kal vechomer</a></em> from <em>hashavas aveida</em> (the obligation to return lost items to save the owner from monetary loss) to <em>hashovas gufo</em> ('returning' a person's life).</p>\n<p>From this question of the Gemara, the Minchas Chinuch concludes that the parameters of the obligations are the same, and therefore one can infer laws of לא תעמוד על דם רעך from the laws of השבת אבידה. Consequently, he rules that there would be no obligation to save a life by suicide, just like there is no obligation to return a lost item which the owner deliberately destroyed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראה לכאורה דאם אחד מאבד עמצו לדעת ויכול אחד להצילו, אפשר דאינו מוזהר\nעל הלאו, לא מיבעיא דעל העשה והשבותו לרבות אבידת גופו וודאי אינו מצווה,\nכי העשה דהשבת אבידה אינה נוהגת בממון באבידה מדעת כמבואר בשו\"ע חו\"מ סי'\nרס\"א ס\"ד, אלא אף על הלאו הזה אינו מוזהר, דמקשה הש\"ס בסנהדרין שם למה לי\nהלאו על טובע בנהר הא מוהשבותו לו נפקא ליה לרבות אבידת גופו, הא יכול\nלומר דנפקא מיניה במאבד עצמו לדעת דאינו מצווה על אבידת גופו, כמו דאינו\nמצווה על אבידת ממונו מדעת, א\"כ על כן כתבה התורה הלאו הזה, אלא על כרחך\nדגם בלאו הזה אינו מוזהר ומצווה, כן נראה לי ברור</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, R Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe YD 2:174:3) takes issue with this line of reasoning, explaining that the leniency that applies to a deliberate <em>aveida</em> would not apply to suicide, because one does not have the same ownership of ones' body that he has on ones' money:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אינו ראיה של כלום גם לחדוש המנ\"ח לפטור להציל מאבד עצמו לדעת, דהא\nל\"ד כלל לאבדת ממון מדעת, שלהשליך לחוץ במקום הפקר שיאבד ממנו הוא דבר\nשרשאי אדם לעשות כן בשל עצמו ואין מחוייבין למנעו מרצונו ולהשיב, ואף אם\nישליך למקום אבוד מן העולם שיש איסור בל תשחית, הרי עכ\"פ לא שייך לחייב\nבשביל זה להשיב לו דוקא אלא היה שייך לחייב ליקח ממקום האבוד ולהניחו אף\nבמקום הפקר, וזה הא לא חייבה תורה לאדם להציל דברים מהשחתה דהתורה אסרה\nרק להשחית בידים ולא להציל מהשחתה כשאין לחייבו מצד הפסד הבעלים, אבל\nלאבד נפש הא אינו רשאי אף נפש עצמו ולכן ודאי לא שייך שבשביל מה שהפקיר\nנפשו שאין לו הרשות לזה יפטרו אחרים מלהצילו, ואף בממון אם היה מציאות\nכה\"ג שהיה עליו איסור להפקיר נמי היו מחוייבין להחזיר לו, שלכן אין צורך\nלקרא דלא תעמוד על דם רעך בשביל זה דאף מקרא והשבותו לו דהיינו אומרים\nשהוא רק כדין ממון נמי היינו יודעין שמחוייבין להציל גם מאבד עצמו לדעת.\nונמצא שגם לסברת המנ\"ח ליכא שום ראיה. ולכן ברור ופשוט שחייבין להצילו\nואף לחלל שבת על הצלתו, ואמרו לי שכן מפורש בספרו של הגאון מהרי\"ל דיסקין\nובספר חלקת יואב בפשיטות דמחוייבין להציל גם בחלול שבת גם את מי שאיבד\nעצמו לדעת והוא ברור לדינא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>שו״ת מהר\"ם מרוטענבערג סי' לט</li>\n<li>קבא דקשייתא קושיא א</li>\n<li>שו\"ת מנחת יצחק ח\"ה סימן ח</li>\n<li>שו\"ת מהרי\"ל דיסקין קונטרס אחרון סימן ה' ס\"ק לד</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

( ה\"ג הדולפנין פרים ורבים מבני אדם - שאם בא אדם עליהם מתעברות הימנו )</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rashi on Bekhorot 8a:1:2</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Sons of the sea - there are fish in the sea that are half in the form of a man and half in the form of a fish. Sirene in old French. ( בני ימא - דגים יש בים שחציין צורת אדם וחציין צורת דג ובלע\"ז שריינ\"א )</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ramban on Leviticus 11:10:1</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nIn my view, however, “creature that creeps [sheretz]” includes the fish swimming in water, because the connotation of shritza is movement, and “any living creature” refers to the sea animals that walk on their feet like the beasts of the field. All of them have one law. The Midrash in Toras Kohanim, however, says: “‘Living’ — this refers to the beasts of the sea, ‘creature’ — this includes the mermaid. \n</blockquote>\n<p>[https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/206651?lang=bi]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The concept of a Mermaid seems similar to the Philistine false idol Dagon.</li>\n<li>Why would a false mythological being be accepted as a real sea-creature by Rashi & Ramban?</li>\n<li>Does Judaism still support Mermaids are real?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, mermaids do not exist. The Gemara describes dolphins, which Rashi mistook as mermaids or read it that way in Worms. Similarly, what Christopher Columbus and the Spanish explorers thought were mermaids were actually manatees.</p>\n<p>The Gemara states:[1]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything copulates front facing back, except for three species that\ncopulate face-to-face: fish [dolphins], humans and snakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, there is a variant in the Gemara. It reads that \"dolphins mate LIKE humans [kivnei adam], not \"with humans\" [bivnei adam].\" Rashi substituted the \"like\" with \"with.\"[2]</p>\n<p>[1] See Bechoros 8a. The \"people of the sea\" who breed like humans are dolphins because dolphins breed like humans, they are actually not fish but mammals.</p>\n<p>[2] I thank @Shalom in the comment section for bringing this to my attention.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I dont think its forbidden to believe in something which youve never seen. Even if you were to show me Jewish sources which ascribe supernatural powers to mermaids, it likely wouldnt be an issue of avodah zarah as long as it isnt being worshipped (actively seeking its favor). Furthermore, the fact that it may have been a philistine deity does not mean it wasnt a real thing - see the cow in hinduism. Also, perhaps rashi and ramban dispute the claim that dagon was a mermaid.</p>\n\n\n",

Connecting various details, including in variant versions, Geula proposed that this list reflects a (significantly) variant version of the list of the sages of the Septuagint, likely preserved in Eretz Yisrael or in Byzantium, and then later merged with or built over a drasha on the verse \"ואספה לי שבעים איש\". See in his article for an explanation of the association of the passage to the above-mentioned Rav Shmuel.</p>\n<p>Adding to @Aryeh's answer, both the author of the Letter and Josephus wrote that the name of the High Priest at the time of the translation was Elazar (<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link122HCH0002\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities XII:2:4-7</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Now when this had been done after so magnificent a manner, according to the king's inclinations, he gave order to Demetrius to give him in writing his sentiments concerning the transcribing of the Jewish books; for no part of the administration is done rashly by these kings, but all things are managed with great circumspection...he commanded that an epistle should be drawn up for Eleazar, the Jewish high priest, concerning these matters; and that they should inform him of the release of the Jews that had been in slavery among them...When Onias the high priest was dead, his son Simon became his successor. He was called Simon the Just because of both his piety towards God, and his kind disposition to those of his own nation. When he was dead, and had left a young son, who was called Onias, Simon's brother Eleazar, of whom we are speaking, took the high priesthood; and he it was to whom Ptolemy wrote...This was the reply which the high priest made. But it does not seem to me to be necessary to set down the names of the seventy [two] elders who were sent by Eleazar, and carried the law, which yet were subjoined at the end of the epistle...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Josephus most likely based himself on the Letter of Aristeas for information on the exchange between Elazar and Ptolemy, and for the rest of information, it seems he had another source.</p>\n<p>A number of scholars have suggested over the years that this Elazar the High Priest was Rabbi Elazar ben Charsom. The first appears to have been Avraham Mevarech in his essay (in Hebrew) \"Al Mishpachot Ashirot Ba'aretz Bizman Bayit Sheni\", <em>Shanah be'Shanah</em> 5740, pp. 318-321.</p>\n<p>This was later independently proposed and greatly expanded upon by Dr. Chaim Chefetz in his essay (in Hebrew) \"Hakohanim Hagedolim Be'tchilat Yemei Bayit Sheni M'shimon Hatzaddik V'ad Yochanan Kohen Gadol\" (The High Priests In The Beginning of the Second Temple Era From Simon the Just until Yochanan the High Priest), in the book \"Mincha L'Ish\", pp. 230-232 (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...According to Hirsch, it's doubtful whether Elazar really served as High Priest after Shimon Hatzaddik (Simon the Just), and doubtful even more, in his view, whether this Elazar even ever existed...however, with all due respect, I must object to this doubt on principle, because, as prior explained, we mustn't blame Josephus on inventing things, without clear evidence from a different source...thanks to Josephus we are able to solve a mystery that hovers over a famous figure mentioned in the Talmud, named Elazar who served as a High Priest during the time of the Second Temple. We learn in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.9a.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tractate Yoma 9a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But the years of the wicked will be shortened; that is a reference to the Second Temple, which stood for four hundred and twenty years and in which over three hundred High Priests served. In calculating the tenures of the High Priests, deduct from the figure of four hundred and twenty years forty years that Shimon HaTzaddik served, and eighty years that Yoḥanan the High Priest served, ten years that Yishmael ben Pavi served, and some say <strong>eleven years that Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsum served</strong>...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...and in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.23.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to his commentary on the Mishna</a>...the Rambam places R' Elazar ben Charsom in the time of Antignos of Socho, noted student of Shimon Hatzaddik. All commentators and researchers note that Rambam's source for this statement is unknown. From what we know about the Rambam, there's almost nothing in terms of halacha and aggadah that's found in his books that he didn't take from the spectrum of Talmudic and Midrashic literature. The existence of this source is proven, in my opinion, entirely from Josephus, who also took from that source his statement that after Shimon Hatzaddik, his brother served in the role of High Priest after him, meaning his \"brother\" in justice and Torah, Elazar. And even the historical logic requires this, because after the ugly story that happened between the sons of Shimon Hatzaddik [explained earlier in the essay], when the slyness of one and the lack of Torah knowledge of the other were discovered, it would be safe to assume that the elders of the priesthood and the leaders of the people would decide to elect a wise, knowledgeable figure...a student-friend of Shimon Hatzaddik, who would serve as High Priest until the rage will dissipate and give way to shame, and of the descendants of Shimon Hatzaddik will rise in age and in wisdom...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Aharon Hyman</a> in Toldot Tannaim V'Amoraim also hints to this interpretation in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%90/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%9B%D7%94%22%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his entry on R' Elazar ben Charsom</a>.</p>\n<p>tl;dr Elazar the High Priest at the time of the LXX was Rabbi Elazar ben Charsom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A3_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%99#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%AA%20%D7%A8%D7%99%22%D7%91%20%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9F,%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">According</a> to Rabbi Avraham Zaccuto in Sefer Yuchasin, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_(2_Maccabees)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elderly Elazar</a> who was beaten to death on the command of Antiochus IV in 2 Maccabees 6:21, 23 was one of the sages who translated the Septuagint.

He then went to each one of\nthem and said to him, ‘Write for me [a translation of] the Torah of\nMoses your master’. The Omnipresent inspired them and the mind of all\nof them was identical, so that each on his own wrote the [same\ntranslation of the] Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not familiar with other rabbinic accounts as to the identity of the rabbis, but the Jewish historian <strong>Philo of Alexandria</strong> provides an account of the Septuagint writers that might be helpful. It appears in a biography that he wrote on Moses (<em>Moses 1 and 2</em>, 2:31-38), and in it he praises the translators. He mentions the location of the translation, some context (e.g., they were determined by the Cohen Gadol), and claims that they received <em>ruach hakodesh</em> in completing the task (which, considering the many differences from the original, has led many scholars to conclude that Philo wasn't fluent in Hebrew, like many Alexandrian Jews at the time). Here's his report:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This great man [Ptolemy], having conceived an ardent affection for our laws, determined to have the Chaldean translated into Greek, and at once dispatched envoys to the high priest and king of Judaea, both offices being held by the same person, explaining his wishes and urging him to choose by merit persons to make a full rendering of the Law into Greek. The high priest was naturally pleased, and, thinking that God’s guiding care must have led the king to busy himself in such an undertaking, <strong>sought out such Hebrews as he had of the highest reputation, who had received an education in Greek as well as in their native lore</strong>, and joyfully sent them to Ptolemy. When they arrived, they were offered hospitality, and, having been sumptuously entertained, requited their entertainer with a feast of words full of wit and weight. For he tested the wisdom of each by propounding for discussion new instead of the ordinary questions, which problems they solved with happy and well-pointed answers in the form of apophthegms, as the occasion did not allow of lengthy speaking.</p>\n<p>After standing this test, they at once began to fulfill the duties of\ntheir high errand. Reflecting how great an undertaking it was to make\na full version of the laws given by the Voice of God, where they could\nnot add or take away or transfer anything, but must keep the original\nform and shape, they proceeded to look for the most open and\nunoccupied a spot in the neighborhood outside the city. For, within\nthe walls, it was full of every kind of living creatures, and\nconsequently the prevalence of diseases and deaths, and the impure\nconduct of the healthy inhabitants, made them suspicious of it. In\nfront of Alexandria lies the island of Pharos, stretching with its\nnarrow strip of land towards the city, and enclosed by a sea not deep\nbut mostly consisting of shoals, so that the loud din and booming of\nthe surging waves grows faint through the long distance before it\nreaches the land. Judging this to be the most suitable place in the\ndistrict, where they might find peace and tranquillity and the soul\ncould commune with the laws with none to disturb its privacy, they\nfixed their abode there; and, taking the sacred books, stretched them\nout towards heaven with the hands that held them, asking of God that\nthey might not fail in their purpose. And He assented to their\nprayers, to the end that the greater part, or even the whole, of the\nhuman race might be profited and led to a better life by continuing to\nobserve such wise and truly admirable ordinances.</p>\n<p>Sitting here in seclusion with none present save the elements of\nnature, earth, water, air, heaven, the genesis of which was to be the\nfirst theme of their sacred revelation, for the laws begin with the\nstory of the world’s creation, they became as it were possessed, and,\nunder inspiration, wrote, not each several scribe something different,\nbut the same word for word, as though dictated to each by an\ninvisible prompter. Yet who does not know that every language, and\nGreek especially, abounds in terms, and that the same thought can be\nput in many shapes by changing single words and whole phrases and\nsuiting the expression to the occasion? This was not the case, we are told, with this law of ours, but the Greek words used corresponded literally with the Chaldean, exactly suited to the things they indicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We would thus have to explain Shemos 24:5 as having occurred \"before Matan Torah\" as per Rashi to 24:1, and if a cow would wish to bring a Shelamim today, we would not accept it. (Non-Jews are permitted to bring Korbanot even nowadays- עיין ברמב\"ם שם יט:טז.)</p>\n<p>However, another possible explanation of the cows' actions in Shemot would be that cows have a special status, similar to Rabbis:</p>\n<p>פרים ורבים</p>\n<p>I'm not sure why this would be - perhaps because their speech puts you to sleep?

However, Jewish cows can. The cows referred to in this verse were converting to Judaism. This is clear since the prototypical case of conversion to Judaism is learned from this very verse, teaching that olah and shelamim sacrifices are an integral part of the conversion process (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Keritot.8b.18?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Keritot 8b with Rashi</a>).</p>\n<p>In fact, it was not only the cows but may also have been the sheep who were converting (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chagigah.6b.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chagigah 6b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בעי רב חסדא האי קרא היכי כתיב וישלח את נערי בני ישראל ויעלו עולות כבשים ויזבחו זבחים שלמים לה' פרים או דלמא אידי ואידי פרים הוו</p>\n<p>Rav Chisda asked: How are we to read this verse? \"And he sent the youth of Israel, and <em>sheep</em> offered olot, and <em>cows</em> offered shelamim?\" Or perhaps cows offered both of them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know that the sheep had already fulfilled their obligation for the shelamim with the pesach sacrifice. The question was simply whether they had also already made the olah sacrifice at the same time, or whether they waited until now to perform the olah. The cows, however, who hadn't previously participated in a sacrifice, would have been obligated in both.</p>\n<p>The mass-conversion of the Jews' animals should come as no surprise, since it was already mentioned by Moses when Pharaoh tried to negotiate to keep the animals in Egypt (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.26\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 10:26</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְגַם־מִקְנֵ֜נוּ יֵלֵ֣ךְ עִמָּ֗נוּ לֹ֤א תִשָּׁאֵר֙ פַּרְסָ֔ה כִּ֚י מִמֶּ֣נּוּ נִקַּ֔ח לַֽעֲבֹ֖ד אֶת־יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ</p>\n<p>And our livestock will come with us too, not a hoof will remain, since we'll take them to serve the Lord our God!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>I think the translation of the Rambam is different than cited:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>העכו\"ם אין מקבלין מהן אלא עולות בלבד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The acronym עכו\"ם is actually potentially short for:\n\"all cows moo\", and the ה makes the phrase into a question (like hawmeen hawayts), so the Rambam would mean simply:</p>\n<p>\"All cows moo? Yes! We accept from them [everything!] Except for oyloys, only [implying other sacrifices, such as shlawmeem, are accepted]</p>\n<p>Blessings and success</p>\n\n\n",

Does the Torah encompasses some of G-ds essence? Does it expresses G-ds essence in some way? What does it mean when G-d is in it; when what He wrote and gave contains G-ds soul?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028886/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Tanya, Likutei Amarim, chapter 5)</a> explains that when we study Torah, G-d clothes the soul and envelops it from head to foot with the Divine light:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hence the special superiority, infinitely great and wonderful, that is in the commandment of knowing the Torah and comprehending it, over all the commandments involving action, and even those relating to speech, and even the commandment to study the Torah, which is fulfilled through speech. For, through all the commandments involving speech or action, the Holy One, blessed be He, clothes the soul and envelops it from head to foot with the Divine light. However, with regard to knowledge of the Torah, apart from the fact that the intellect is clothed in Divine wisdom, this Divine wisdom is also contained in it, to the extent that his intellect comprehends, grasps and encompasses, as much as it is able so to do, of the knowledge of the Torah, every man according to his intellect, his knowledgeable capacity, and his comprehension in Pardes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028879/jewish/Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 4 of Tanya</a>, the Alter Rebbe writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, since the Torah and its commandments \"clothe\" all ten faculties of the soul with all its 613 organs from head to foot, it [the soul] is altogether truly bound up in the Bundle of Life with G‑d, and the very light of G‑d envelops and clothes it from head to foot, as it is written, \"G‑d is my Rock, I will take refuge in Him,\" and it is also written, \"With favour (ratzon— will) wilt Thou compass him as with a shield,\" that is to say, with His blessed will and wisdom which are clothed in His Torah and its commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what exactly does the statement \"Ana Nafshi Ketivat Yehavit\" means?</p>\n<p>The answer can be found <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org.il/Concepts/Item.asp?ArticleID=98&CategoryID=200&SubjectID=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאשר הקב\"ה נתן את התורה בהר-סיני, הוא פתח במלה 'אנכי'. אומרת על כך הגמרא, ש'אנכי' ראשי-תיבות: \"אנא נפשי כתבית יהבית\" (=אני את נפשי כתבתי ונתתי). כלומר: בתורה נתן לנו הקב\"ה את עצמו, כביכול. הוא הלביש בה את חכמתו האין-סופית ואת רצונו העצמותי. כאשר יהודי לומד את התורה, מתמזג שכלו עם שכלו של הקב\"ה, כביכול.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>אנא נפשי כתבית יהבית means that G-ds very essence is within the Torah and, when we study the Torah, we so-to-speak \"merge with G-d\".</p>\n<p>The Torah is G-ds \"divine wisdom\" as the Alter Rebbe (Tanya, chapter 5) explains. Through Torah study, we can \"grasp\" that divine wisdom and merge with G-ds mind so to speak.

They were to observe them as days of feasting and merrymaking, and as an occasion for sending gifts to one another and presents to the poor.\" ( כַּיָּמִ֗ים אֲשֶׁר־נָ֨חוּ בָהֶ֤ם הַיְּהוּדִים֙ מֵא֣וֹיְבֵיהֶ֔ם וְהַחֹ֗דֶשׁ אֲשֶׁר֩ נֶהְפַּ֨ךְ לָהֶ֤ם מִיָּגוֹן֙ לְשִׂמְחָ֔ה וּמֵאֵ֖בֶל לְי֣וֹם ט֑וֹב לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת אוֹתָ֗ם יְמֵי֙ מִשְׁתֶּ֣ה וְשִׂמְחָ֔ה וּמִשְׁל֤וֹחַ מָנוֹת֙ אִ֣ישׁ לְרֵעֵ֔הוּ וּמַתָּנ֖וֹת לָֽאֶבְיוֹנִֽים )</blockquote></p>\n<p><strong>Megillah 7a:20</strong> <blockquote>\nוּמַתָּנוֹת לָאֶבְיוֹנִים תָּנֵי רַב יוֹסֵף וּמִשְׁלוֹחַ מָנוֹת אִישׁ לְרֵעֵהוּ שְׁתֵּי מָנוֹת לְאִישׁ אֶחָד וּמַתָּנוֹת לָאֶבְיוֹנִים שְׁתֵּי מַתָּנוֹת לִשְׁנֵי בְּנֵי אָדָם</p>\n<p>The mishna mentions: And gifts distributed to the poor. Rav Yosef taught a baraita that the verse states: “And of sending portions one to another” (Esther 9:22), indicating two portions to one person. The verse continues: “And gifts to the poor” (Esther 9:22), indicating two gifts to two people.</blockquote></p>\n<p><strong>Are Bread + Hummus acceptable as the 2 Food portions? - Yes.

However, with regard to Shmuel’s proof from the fact that they confirmed above what they took upon themselves below, there is certainly no refutation. Ravina said: This explains the folk saying that people say: One sharp pepper is better than a basketful of pumpkins, as the quality of the pepper’s taste is more significant than the quantity of the pumpkins.</blockquote></p>\n\n\n",

Other unsuitable animals are left to graze and be sold.  Is there any comment that this starvation death is blatantly against tzar baaley chaim?

If the prior - one can speculate that this is a \"גזירת הכתוב\" to which we can say that the animal that was destined to die because of a person's sin, as a sacrifice, must die anyway, but who can really know.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if this is a decree of the Sages, then the principle is that it is permissible to harm animals for the benefit of man, up to a certain limit of reasonableness, according to the severity of the harm on the one hand and the magnitude of the benefit on the other. The harm here is clear and obvious; the question is how we measure and relate to the benefit.  In the view of the Sages, the possibility of a Jew committing a sin with his own hands, even if it were accidental, is more serious than the pain caused to an animal. AH YD 309:63:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who does something out of fear of a sin - there is no prohibition of hurting animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, when a person causes pain to an animal in order to prevent another transgression from a human - there is no prohibition of hurting animals, because this is to the persons benefit.</p>\n<p>In the Responsa Noda b'Yehuda ( YD. 82-83) which discusses pain of animals, explains that since at the time of entry to the enclosure the animal is not in pain, and it comes naturally after some time it is not considered that the person caused harm. Although animal suffering is a very severe sin, in terms of the prohibition of animal cruelty, the measure is more from the perspective of the human act, to what extent he was involved in the matter. This consideration highlights the centrality of man in creation, and the strictness of animal cruelty is primarily in terms of the purity of man's soul.\nA similar response is given in the Responsa Igrot Moshe, CHM 2nd part, 47, regarding the preferred way to destroy pests, see there).\nThe intention of these two responsa is not to diminish the severity of animal cruelty, but to draw attention to the the possibility of having benefit from  הקדש.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If one subscribes to the <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/divine-command-theory/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">divine command theory</a>, namely that there is no morality external to God, as God determines what is moral and there is no external objective morality, then all is well.</p>\n<p>One articulation of this concept is Aish Kodesh, page 68:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה אומות העולם, גם הטובים שבהם, חושבים שהאמת הוא דבר עצם לעצמו, וה' ציווה על האמת מפני שהאמת לעצמו אמת... מה שאין כן ישראל אומרים 'אתה אלוהים אמת', הוא יתברך אמת, ואין אמת זולתו, וכל אמת שנמצא בעולם הוא רק מפני שכן ציווה ה' ורצה, וכיוון שהוא יתברך אמת, לכן גם זה אמת. ואסור לגזול מפני שה' האמת כן ציווה. ובשביל ציווי של ה' האמיתי, מעשה זה גם אמת. וכשה' ציווה ההיפך, שהפקר בי\"ד הפקר, אז זה נעשה אמת, שהונו של זה הפקר. כשציווה לאברהם אבינו שיעקוד את יצחק בנו, היה זה האמת לעקדו, ובאם לא אמר לו אחר כך 'אל תעש לו מאומה', היה זה האמת לשחטו.</p>\n<p>Behold, the nations of the world—even the best among them—believe that truth is an entity unto itself, and that God commanded truth because truth, in and of itself, is true. Not so Israel, who say: “You are God, truth” — He, may He be blessed, is truth, and there is no truth besides Him. Any truth that exists in the world is only because God so commanded and willed it. And since He, may He be blessed, is truth, therefore this too is truth. It is forbidden to steal because the true God so commanded. And due to the command of the true God, this action becomes truth. And when God commanded the opposite—that “a court’s declaration of ownerlessness renders it ownerless”—then that too becomes truth: that this person’s property is now ownerless. When God commanded Abraham our father to bind his son Isaac, then it was truth to bind him. And had He not subsequently said, “Do not do anything to him,” it would have been truth to slaughter him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Secondly, the shekhinah is not a distinct entity, separate from G-d. This anti-monotheistic view reflects the dangers of a polytheistic belief. Rather, we should understand the shekhinah figuratively, as a human feeling of the presence of G-d. To do otherwise borders on polytheism.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore the Torah must reflect that fact and, just as it mentions it elsewhere, start with \"And God spoke [this Torah] to Moses, saying: \"in the beginning...\" etc.</p>\n<p>Also, this would \"prove\" that the historical parts were also dictated by God and not passed orally, or invented.</p>\n<p>Why doesn't it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is actually discussed in two sources. One is Zohar to Bereshit 15b and afterward. The second is Me’or Einayim to Parshat Terumah 3.</p>\n<p>The essence of this is that Moshe is present in all generations. (אתפשטותא דמשה בכל דרא ודרא)</p>\n<p>Sometimes that is in a revealed state and sometimes it is in a concealed state.</p>\n<p>In the case of the beginning of creation, and Israel which precedes creation, Moshe is in a concealed state in that context.</p>\n<p>The explanation of this subject could fill volumes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My opinion.</p>\n<p>The Torah doesn't begin with \"God spoke to Moses saying:...\" because Moses didn't need to exist according to the Torah. The Torah does not seem to take for granted that everything that happens was intended to happen. Somethings are definitely foreshadowed and prophecies are given, but that isn't true for everything.</p>\n<p>Case in point is Ishmael. God clearly tells Abraham that he'll have a son, and so Isaac and his descendants are definitely part of \"the plan.\" However, it seems to me that Ishmael wasn't a part of \"the plan,\" and instead became something that God has to work around because Sarah and Abraham were trying to make the prophecy of Abraham having a son come true by introducing Hagar into the mix. But if Sarah and Abraham had just continued to wait and not had Hagar become a concubine, then so many things would have happened so differently and God even has to kind of correct Abraham's expectations or ideas about Ishmael because it's a deviation from the plan.</p>\n<p>On that same vein I don't believe it was destined for Moses to exist or for Israel to need a human redeemer. Perhaps if Joseph's family hadn't have had so much infighting, attempted murders, and deceit to the bitter end then things with the famine and Egypt could have played out differently. I also don't recall any prophecy or foreshadowing of a great redeemer taking Abraham's descendants out of Egypt, but instead that they would be enslaved for centuries and God would punish the Egyptians and set the Israelites free, with no mention of a Moses type figure.</p>\n<p>Genesis 15:4-14;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ד  וְהִנֵּה דְבַר-יְהוָה אֵלָיו לֵאמֹר, לֹא יִירָשְׁךָ זֶה:  כִּי-אִם\nאֲשֶׁר יֵצֵא מִמֵּעֶיךָ, הוּא יִירָשֶׁךָ.     4 And, behold, the word of\nthe LORD came unto him, saying: 'This man shall not be thine heir; but\nhe that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.'\nה  וַיּוֹצֵא אֹתוֹ הַחוּצָה, וַיֹּאמֶר הַבֶּט-נָא הַשָּׁמַיְמָה\nוּסְפֹר הַכּוֹכָבִים--אִם-תּוּכַל, לִסְפֹּר אֹתָם; וַיֹּאמֶר לוֹ, כֹּה\nיִהְיֶה זַרְעֶךָ.     5 And He brought him forth abroad, and said: 'Look\nnow toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count\nthem'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed be.' ו  וְהֶאֱמִן,\nבַּיהוָה; וַיַּחְשְׁבֶהָ לּוֹ, צְדָקָה.   6 And he believed in the\nLORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness. ז  וַיֹּאמֶר,\nאֵלָיו:  אֲנִי יְהוָה, אֲשֶׁר הוֹצֵאתִיךָ מֵאוּר כַּשְׂדִּים--לָתֶת\nלְךָ אֶת-הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת, לְרִשְׁתָּהּ.   7 And He said unto him: 'I am\nthe LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee\nthis land to inherit it.' ח  וַיֹּאמַר:  אֲדֹנָי יְהוִה, בַּמָּה אֵדַע\nכִּי אִירָשֶׁנָּה.    8 And he said: 'O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know\nthat I shall inherit it?' ט  וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו, קְחָה לִי עֶגְלָה\nמְשֻׁלֶּשֶׁת, וְעֵז מְשֻׁלֶּשֶׁת, וְאַיִל מְשֻׁלָּשׁ; וְתֹר, וְגוֹזָל.\n9 And He said unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a\nshe-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a\nturtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' י  וַיִּקַּח-לוֹ אֶת-כָּל-אֵלֶּה,\nוַיְבַתֵּר אֹתָם בַּתָּוֶךְ, וַיִּתֵּן אִישׁ-בִּתְרוֹ, לִקְרַאת\nרֵעֵהוּ; וְאֶת-הַצִּפֹּר, לֹא בָתָר.  10 And he took him all these,\nand divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the\nother; but the birds divided he not. יא  וַיֵּרֶד הָעַיִט,\nעַל-הַפְּגָרִים; וַיַּשֵּׁב אֹתָם, אַבְרָם.   11 And the birds of prey\ncame down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away. יב  וַיְהִי\nהַשֶּׁמֶשׁ לָבוֹא, וְתַרְדֵּמָה נָפְלָה עַל-אַבְרָם; וְהִנֵּה אֵימָה\nחֲשֵׁכָה גְדֹלָה, נֹפֶלֶת עָלָיו.     12 And it came to pass, that, when\nthe sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a\ndread, even a great darkness, fell upon him. יג  וַיֹּאמֶר לְאַבְרָם,\nיָדֹעַ תֵּדַע כִּי-גֵר יִהְיֶה זַרְעֲךָ בְּאֶרֶץ לֹא לָהֶם,\nוַעֲבָדוּם, וְעִנּוּ אֹתָם--אַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת, שָׁנָה.  13 And He said\nunto Abram: 'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a\nland that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict\nthem four hundred years; יד  וְגַם אֶת-הַגּוֹי אֲשֶׁר יַעֲבֹדוּ, דָּן\nאָנֹכִי; וְאַחֲרֵי-כֵן יֵצְאוּ, בִּרְכֻשׁ גָּדוֹל.    14 and also that\nnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they\ncome out with great substance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I might be way off base here, and if so please let me know, but I don't understand why it's a question.</p>\n<p>Every time it says \"And G-D spoke to Moses\" it doesn't say \"and he told him to write as follows\" it just says what He told him. It is a historical fact of what took place. (I.e. at this or that time, or at this it that place, G-D said the following commandment). Then later,  at the end of the 40 years, right before Moses's death, he wrote the sefer Torah with everything that G-D had said to him over the last 40 plus years, and also included the things that took place beforehand, from creation until the time of Moses death.</p>\n<p>The entire Torah was given to Moshe on Har Sinai and he transcribed it exactly as it was given to him.

    "content": "# Hypothetical, what should a wife do if she discovers her husband is uncircumcised?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Circumcision is an integral part of Judaism. That being said, there really isn't an \"inspection\" to verify someone is circumcised. Unless the individual is a convert, there isn't a circumstance I'm aware of where the Rabbis \"verify\" someone has been circumcised. We take everyone's word for it.</p>\n<p><strong>That brings me to my hypothetical question.</strong></p>\n<p>A husband and wife are married and they engage in relations once the ceremony and events have been finished.</p>\n<p>In this moment, the wife comes to the realization that her husband has never been circumcised. While he is Jewish and comes from a Jewish mother, the family never had him circumcised <em><strong>(this is a hypothetical so we can just say it was because they disagreed with circumcision like many secular folks do)</strong></em></p>\n<p>What is a wife supposed to do in such a situation?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the wedding considered valid?</li>\n<li>Is she supposed to tell the Rabbi?</li>\n<li>Is she forbidden from having relations with him?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What exactly is the wife suppose to do in such a situation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Being circumcised does not affect one's status as a Jew. His wedding is valid, and he can continue living with his wife.</p>\n<p>There are certain males who are not allowed to be circumcised, including those whom it may be hazardous to their health, and those who are born circumcised.</p>\n<p>Thus, if a wife (or anybody else) discovers a male is uncircumcised, they should talk to him about it, and - in consultation with a Rabbi - if it's because of health issues, nothing need be done.</p>\n<p>If the person is uncircumcised because of ideological reasons (of him or his parents), or ignorance then the person should be persuaded to undergo a professional <strong>Jewish</strong> circumcision by a professional <strong>Jewish</strong> Mohel.</p>\n<p>A Jewish male who should be circumcised and isn't, is liable to be punished by the heavenly punishment called Kareth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>She should ask him about it (yes, in bed on the wedding night). This could potentially be an embarrassing but otherwise inconsequential point, or possibly a show stopper.</p>\n<p>That is, if the reason for his not being circumcised is because of a health issue, while it is funny that he never mentioned this until now, there is no fundamental problem. A rabbi must be consulted to see if the medical objection is in line with halacha, but that can wait.</p>\n<p>If, however, there is an ideological objection, then things get tricky. \"Disagreeing\" with circumcision is apikorsis, denying the validity of the commandments. If the wife thought that she was marrying a more or less religious man, that could be reason the invalidate the marriage, and if so make relations forbidden as pre-marital (out of wedlock) relations. The marriage would be in doubt, because the man might have intended to be religious at the time of the formalizations of the marriage, and now he is returning to his problematic position. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.38.31?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source.</a>)</p>\n<p>One way out would be if she knew that he was not religious, in which case this wouldn't effect the validity of the marriage. He has a personal issue, and a very serious one that goes to the core of his religious identity, but his status as a born Jew is not hurt by his misdeeds or heresy. He should be persuaded to accept circumcision, but that again doesn't have to happen already on the wedding night.</p>\n<p>Another way out would be if the man never though about it. His parents rejected circumcision, but he didn't know that one who was not circumcised at eight days is required to do so himself. In this case also they can wait till the morning to get in touch with a mohel to do the circumcision.</p>\n\n\n",

From the Prefatory Remarks in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>In our commentary on the Mishnah we stated our intention to explain difficult problems in the Book on Prophecy</strong> and in the Book of Harmony. In the latter we intended to examine all the passages in the Midrash which, if taken literally, appear to be inconsistent with truth and common sense, and must therefore be taken figuratively. Many years have elapsed since I first commenced those works. <strong>I had proceeded but a short way when I became dissatisfied with my original plan.</strong> For I observed that by expounding these passages by means of allegorical and mystical terms, we do not explain anything, but merely substitute one thing for another of the same nature, whilst in explaining them fully our efforts would displease most people; and my sole object in planning to write those books was to make the contents of Midrashim and the exoteric lessons of the prophecies intelligible to everybody. We have further noticed that when an ill-informed Theologian reads these Midrashim, he will find no difficulty; for possessing no knowledge of the properties of things, he will not reject statements which involve impossibilities. When, however, a person who is both religious and well educated reads them, he cannot escape the following dilemma: either he takes them literally, and questions the abilities of the author and the soundness of his mind-doing thereby nothing which is opposed to the principles of our faith,--or he will acquiesce in assuming that the passages in question have some secret meaning, and he will continue to hold the author in high estimation whether he understood the allegory or not. As regards prophecy in its various degrees and the different metaphors used in the prophetic books, we shall give in the present work an explanation, according to a different method. <strong>Guided by these considerations I have refrained from writing those two books as I had previously intended.</strong></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp008.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Adding to @Alex's answer, this is also mentioned in Rambam's Commentary On The Mishna:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In his Introduction to Perek Chelek:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And a hundred pages would not suffice just for this matter - and even if it was greatly shortened.

Since chachamim allowed making personal requests within mandatory tefilot (shaharit, mincha, and maariv), Moshe rabbeinu used such an option to request entering Eretz Israel. Moshe started praying on the morning of Tu b'Av of the 40th year in the desert and he finished on the 7th of Adar. Moshe did not make such requests on Shabbos or any Yom Tov in between. Thus, if one were to count the number of requests by the number of tefilos, noting that on the last day Moshe only prayed shararis and mincha, Penei Yehoshua calculates the number 515.</p>\n\n\n",

In the book, a rabbi named Rabbi Avraham Hachozeh<sup>1</sup> is mentioned, and a portion from his book \"Sha'arei Mitzvot\" (שערי מצות) is quoted. When looking for this section in an edition of Chochmat Hanefesh in Hebrewbooks, I saw that in that version they wrote in brackets that this Rabbi Avraham is none other than the Ibn Ezra (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4691&pgnum=136\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pg. 136</a>).

Fleischer explains that this doesn't null the view that Ibn Ezra and Rabbi Avraham Hachozeh are one and the same, because there are multiple examples in which rabbis quote certain ideas in the name of other rabbis, even though the latter clearly state they disagree with those views. He notes, however, that Kaufmann could only prove that the Rabbi Avraham mentioned by the Roke'ach and by Rabbi Avraham ben Azriel is the Ibn Ezra, but not that in the other sources. He then sets out to attempt to do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>About the kinah \"Tzion K'chi\", there's some basis to attribute it to Ibn Ezra: a. It's written in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)#Classical_Arabic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Arabic metrical system</a> with \"long\" (תנועה) and \"short\" (יתד) with the following form: two longs, one short, one long, one short, two long, one short and two long, which is a meter that Ibn Ezra brings in his book \"Hatzachut\" as a legitimate meter that he and others have used. b. This kinah was placed among the kinot of the 9th of Av right after \"Tzion Halo Tish'ali\", by Rabbi Yehudah Halevi, who was a contemporary and close friend of Ibn Ezra. c. Ibn Ezra was a poet and an astrologer, just like Rabbi Avraham. d. The author of the kinah uses terms similar to those used by Ibn Ezra in his \"Sefer Ha'ibur\" and \"Igeret Hashabbat\" (related to astronomy and calendrical calculations). e. The author of the kinah wrote \"From Eden, the place of all that's precious, came out your rivers\", which means that there are two rivers in Eretz Yisrael that come out of Eden, and it seems that only Ibn Ezra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.11?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">held the view</a> that two of the four rivers of Eden come to Eretz Yisrael. f. It's possible to find some hint of this in the last stanza of the kinah where it says: \"לר<strong>א</strong>ות <strong>ב</strong>זיו זה<strong>ר</strong>ך שלום י<strong>ה</strong>י לך ורוב שלו<strong>ם</strong> ל<strong>עזר</strong>יך\", which is almost Ibn Ezra's name (Avraham Ezer).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The piyut \"Avi Re'eh\" is written in a metric form of two long, one short, two long. This is also a form brought by Ibn Ezra in \"Hatzachut\" among the customary meters.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fleischer notes that despite all of this, it's hard to imagine that these were written by Ibn Ezra, because they're so different in content and styling from his usual poems. For example, Ibn Ezra usually inserts many terms from verses in Tanach, and that's not found in these two.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>On the Rabbi Avraham Hachozeh mentioned by Rabbi Binyamin of Tudela: In Fleischer's view, this person couldn't have been the Ibn Ezra. Fleischer believed that by the time Rabbi Binyamin reached Teveria, the Ibn Ezra was no longer alive: From Teveria, Rabbi Binyamin travelled through various locations until he arrived in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mosul</a>, 24-25 days' journey from Teveria. Mosul at the time was ruled by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayf_al-Din_Ghazi_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sayf al-Din Ghazi II</a> (Rabbi Binyamin mentions a Rabbi Yosef Brahan who was an astrologer to King Zun al-Din II), who only began ruling in 1170, while most scholars believe that Ibn Ezra died in 1167 and Fleischer himself thinks he died in 1164. Even if we were to say that Rabbi Binyamin rested in Teveria for a whole year (it's conceivable that he occasionally took long breaks from his long journey), that would still bring us only to 1169, at least two years after Ibn Ezra's death. Furthermore, both Ibn Ezra and Rabbi Binyamin were originally from Tudela. It would be odd that Rabbi Binyamin would refer to a fellow cityman by an odd title, when all over the world he was referred to as Ibn Ezra or Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra. Finally, there's not enough evidence that Ibn Ezra <em>ever</em> lived in Eretz Yisrael.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fleischer concludes therefore that in four of the five references - these are likely referring to Ibn Ezra, although there's still some room for debate about the kinah and piyut, while with Rabbi Binyamin's reference - this is most likely referring to someone else.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%90_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shraga Abramson</a> in his essay \"Navi, Ro'eh and Chozeh - R' Avraham Hachozeh\" (\"A prophet, a watcher and a seer - R' Avraham the seer\" (Sefer Yovel - <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kirshblum-mordecai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Mordechai Kirschblum</a>)) explains that in the past, the titles \"Navi\", \"Ro'eh\" and \"Chozeh\" were reserved for the wisest of Torah sages all over the the world. They were not meant to suggest that these men were actual prophets, but that they were men of great stature. A couple of examples: a. The First Ra'avad in \"Sefer Hakabbalah\" <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36858&pgnum=82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>: \"...והיו בנרבונא חכמים גדולים...ר' יעקב הנביא גאון בר' משה בר' אבון...\" (\"...and in Narbonne there were great sages...R' Yakkov the prophet the gaon, son of R' Moshe, son of R' Abun...\"). b. Rabbeinu Tam in an answer to R' Meshulam, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14542&st=&pgnum=106\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">refers</a> to Rashi as \"וכמו שפי' נביא לבב חכמה\" (\"and as explained by the prophet, the wise of heart...\").</p>\n<p>Most of the essay is dedicated to explaining the meaning of these titles and bringing many examples, but later Abramson discusses Rabbi Avraham Hachozeh. He analyzes several sections of Arugot Habosem and shows that teachings of Ibn Ezra appear in several places, not just when Rabbi Avraham is mentioned. He also shows the original sources of these teachings, within the Ibn Ezra's writings.</p>\n<p>He concludes with saying that it's doubtful that Ibn Ezra was ever referred to as \"hachozeh\" merely because he was learned in astrology, but rather, more likely, that it was a form of rhetoric employed by talmidei chachamim to express admiration towards the person given the title. As for seeming references to calendrical calculations in the piyut by Rabbi Avraham - he believes that these are doubtful and were probably just a form of rhetoric by author.</p>\n\n\n",

They observed how little objects produced by rapid motion a loud, shrilling, and terrifying noise, and concluded that this must to a far higher degree be the case with the bodies of the sun, the moon and the stars, considering their greatness and their velocity. The Pythagoreans believed that the sounds were pleasant, and, though loud, had the same proportions to each other as the musical notes. They also explained why these mighty and tremendous sounds are not heard by us. This belief is also widespread in our nation. Thus our Sages describe the greatness of the sound produced by the sun in the daily circuit in its orbit. The same description could be given of all heavenly bodies. Aristotle, however, rejects this, and holds that they produce no sounds. You will find his opinion in the book <em>The Heavens and the World</em> (De Cœlo). You must not find it strange that Aristotle differs here from the opinion of our Sages. The theory of the music of the spheres is connected with the theory of the motion of the stars in a fixed sphere, and our Sages have, in this astronomical question, abandoned their own theory in favour of the theory of others. Thus, it is distinctly stated, \"The wise men of other nations have defeated the wise men of Israel.\" It is quite right that our Sages have abandoned their own theory: for speculative matters every one treats according to the results of his own study, and every one accepts that which appears to him established by proof.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp095.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What are their rationales?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Haftara for Tzav (a portion from the Babylonian annual Torah cyle) is from Jeremiah 7 (mentioned in Bavli Megillah 23b). The Haftara for the Israeli triennial cycle section that begins near the beginning of Tzav (at Vayikra 6:12) was from Malakhi 3. As in other matters, some customs from Israel made there way to some European communities. (Recall Tzav in non-leap years, and in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/112106/759\">some ancient customs</a> even in leap years, is always on Shabbat HaGadol.)</p>\n<p>Or Zarua (393) quotes a responsum of a R' Menachem about which of the two Haftarot is to be preferred for Tzav:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתוב בתשובות למה לא בטלו עולותיכם ולא הנהיגו [להפטיר] בוערבה שמא משום דסיום דוערבה יום דין הגדול והנורא לכך לא הנהיגו להפטיר וערבה ואני מנחם רוח אחרת עמי מחמת וערבה ולקיים מנהג אבותינו שהיא תורה ושמשו גדולי הדור ורואה אני את דבריהם ואומר אני כשחל י\"ד בניסן להיות בשבת שאי אפשר להפטיר אשר לא צויתי ולא עלתה על לבי ביום שחיטת הפסח משום דכתיב במועדו וא\"א להפטיר ביום שחיטת הפסח גזי נזרך והשליכי ושאי על שפים קינה בשבת שהוא ערב הפסח ולהפיל לבן של ישראל עולי רגלים ומצאתי סייג לדברי כשבא לידי ספר של ה\"ר משה בר משלם זצ\"ל ההובא מארץ בבל והיה בהנביאים סימני הפטרות לפרשיות התורה לכל השנה וראיתי סימן צו את אהרן גבי עולותיכם ועוד סימן צו את אהרן גבי וערבה לה' ולכך כיונתי האמת לומר שפעמים מפטירין לצו את אהרן בעולותיכם ופעמים בוערבה ותנאי בדבר זה אם שנה פשוטה היא וחל צו את אהרן בשבת הגדול שלפני הפסח יפטירו בוערבה וכל שכן כשחל ערב הפסח בשבת ואם שנה מעוברת היא וחל צו את אהרן באחד משבתות של אדר השני ושבת הגדול יהיה באחרי מות אז יפטירו בעולותיכם לצו את אהרן אם לא תהיה אחת מארבע פרשיות באותה שבת ולפי שאין רגילות נוהג כן בכל שנה ושנה מפני שנת העיבור לפיכך נשמט מפי הסדרנים ונהגו תמיד להפטיר בעולותיכם לפי שהוא תדיר ע\"כ התשובה עוד כתוב בתשובו' בשנת העיבו' הי' שב' הגדול בזאת תהיה והפטירו רבותינו בארבע' אנשי' לפי שבאש' כי תזריע לא יכלו להפטיר בנעמן מפני שהית' פרשת החודש והפטירו לויקהל משה בן ז' שנים ולאלה פקודי ותשלם כל המלאכה עד מלא כבוד ולא ויעש חירם ע\"כ לשון התשובה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short (the text is a bit confusing at times, probably somewhat corrupted), he writes that when Tzav is Shabbat HaGadol and all the more so when it is Erev Pesach, we use the Israeli Haftara (Malachi 3) because Jeremiah 7 is too mournful for such a celebratory day. But in a leap year when Tzav is not Shabbat HaGadol (nor one of the special 4 weeks in Adar) we use Jeremiah 7. He even cites an occasion when Metzora' fell on Shabbat HaGadol in a leap year and they read the Haftara about the 4 Lepors (Kings 2:7:3).</p>\n<p>This solves your question about its relevance to the weekly portion. It is indeed a traditional Haftara for the weekly portion of Tzav that we are choosing to use then.</p>\n<p>Now we understand the customs of reading on every Shabbat HaGadol (of non-leap years) and reading on Shabbat HaGadol that falls on Erev Pesach (of non-leap years). (See <a href=\"https://faculty.biu.ac.il/%7Eofery/papers/Ofer-ShabatHagadol.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yosef Ofer's article on the subject</a>.)</p>\n<p>Levush (OC 430) explained the connection of Malachi 3 to the time just before Pesach by noting that verse 10 is reminiscent of the obligation, which falls on Erev Pesach, of giving or destroying any leftover gifts from the previous 3-year tithing cycle (\"Biur Maaserot\"). Accordingly, we get two new practices emphasizing that connection: reading Malachi 3 only when Erev Pesach is after Shabbat which allows the Haftara to serve as an announcement for a future obligation (instituted by the Vilna Gaon (Maaser Rav 176)), and reading only in years 4 and 7 of the Shemitta cycle when Biur Maaserot actually happens (<a href=\"https://www.toraland.org.il/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%94/%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99/%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">advocated by the Adere\"t</a>).</p>\n<p>Another connection given by Levush between Malachi 3 and Pesach is from verse 23 which speaks of the final redemption which clearly parallels the themes of redemption on Pesach. This is the only connection I know of which is calendar independent and could justify reading Malachi 3 in all years. It seems quite likely though that that is not a very old practice.</p>\n<p>Finally I note that many <a href=\"https://nosachteiman.co.il/wp-content/uploads/inner/dbsAttachedFiles/vearva.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baladi Yemenite communities</a> do not read Malachi 3 ever (which makes sense given the Yemenite connection to Babylonian customs).</p>\n\n\n",

Inside, below the berachot, it says that it was printed by the Hebrew Publishing Company.</p>\n<p>Here is a Google Photos album with pictures of the entire thing: <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/yhBt7YtNCi15Sm6r9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://photos.app.goo.gl/yhBt7YtNCi15Sm6r9</a></p>\n<p>Observations from the pictures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is clearly meant to be used in shul, since it says at the top to listen to the berachot from the reader, and it has the end beracha at the end.</li>\n<li>It is 42 lines, which is one of the common layouts.</li>\n<li>It is not a \"Hamelech\" layout</li>\n<li>Some of the columns are a lot wider than other columns (which I have seen in some real megillot too).</li>\n<li>The ten sons of Haman are spaced unevenly, which I've never seen in a real Megillah.</li>\n<li>The glued seams between the sheets of paper look exactly the same as how it is done on a newspaper printing press.</li>\n<li>There are small dots of ink at the top of some columns (which I assume are registration marks for press alignment) and a few places where too much ink caused artifacts.</li>\n<li>To me the lettering looks similar to that which was found in the old Ktav Tikkun Kor'im (which is somehow <a href=\"http://www.ktav.com/index.php/tikkun-torah-lakorim.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">still</a> <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0870685481\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">available</a> to <a href=\"https://www.israelbookshop.com/tikkun-lakorim-ktav.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">purchase</a> 50+ years after publication!), except for the Berachot at the beginning and end which are in the standard font used by Hebrew Publishing Company for their Siddurim (though much larger than anything I've seen in any old Siddur).</li>\n<li>It looks like the berachot may have been movable type, since some of the bigger letters have the top or bottom cracked off, but the text of the Megillah itself is clearly not movable type - it's too crooked and there are places where ascenders of one line cross descenders of the line above.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am trying to find out more about this item, for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I like old sefarim.</li>\n<li>I'm curious exactly how old it is but it doesn't have a year printed on it.</li>\n<li>My wife's grandparents were <em>extremely</em> Yekke (they both grew up in Germany before the war), and I don't know how they would have ended up with something like this from a Chassidish yeshiva.</li>\n<li>Ignoring the case, I'm curious if this was a product that Hebrew Publishing Company actually sold, or if it was a special run done just for the Yeshiva.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does anyone know anything about this item?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While I didn't find information regarding the megillah specifically, it <a href=\"https://www.danwymanbooks.com/pages/books/37456/herman-klopper-henry-russotto/matnah-me-et-yeshivat-rabbeinu-shlomo-kluger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seems</a> that it was customary for the yeshiva to solicit contributions through various 'gifts' given (or sold?) around the chagim. The yeshiva also considered these to be a form of community outreach. The yeshiva (naturally) struggled with money for years. In the NY Times of March 24, 1930 there's an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1930/03/24/archives/lack-of-funds-closes-free-hebrew-school-600-pupils-at-yeshiva-rabbi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> about the yeshiva temporarily closing down and planning a financial campaign. It's behind a paywall, so I can't see the entire article, but it's possible that the campaign included the same type of solicitation.</p>\n<p>As @Mike <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/120742/looking-for-more-information-about-this-megillah/137184#comment399419_120742\">pointed out</a> in the comments, the range of dates for when the Hebrew Publishing Company was located at 632-34 Broadway fits the time of the NYTimes article. So it seems likely the megillah was printed and handed out as a form of soliciting donations.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the yeshiva handed out other items related to the chagim:</p>\n<p>In the 40s, for example, they printed haggadot, titled \"מתנה מאת ישיבת רבנו שלמה קלוגער זצ\"ל\" (A souvenir from Yeshivat Rabbeinu Shlomo Kluger\") (see <a href=\"https://www.danwymanbooks.com/pages/books/37456/herman-klopper-henry-russotto/matnah-me-et-yeshivat-rabbeinu-shlomo-kluger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://merhav.nli.org.il/primo-explore/search?query=any,contains,%22%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%90%20%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%95%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92%D7%A8%20(%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%20%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A7)%22&tab=unified_tab&search_scope=uni&sortby=lso01&vid=NLI&lang=iw_IL&offset=0&cachekey=commonformats&cachekey=ag-commonFomatsItemsQuery&_gl=1*1aqjrn*_ga*MTU0NjAxNzQxNy4xNjUyNjEyMzM0*_ga_8P5PPG5E6Z*MTY5NTk3MjA4OS4zNzguMC4xNjk1OTcyMTA5LjQwLjAuMA..*_ga_8PQRSYT854*MTY5NTk3MjA4OS43NC4wLjE2OTU5NzIxMDkuNDAuMC4w*_ga_4207HLQSXF*MTY5NTk3MjA5MC43NC4wLjE2OTU5NzIxMDkuNDEuMC4w\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Circa the late 40s or early 50s (shortly before they merged with Yeshivat Chasan Sofer) they handed out \"Chanukah tokens\" with a request for donations in the form of \"Chanukah gelt\" (<a href=\"https://mishpacha.com/chanukah-gelt/#:%7E:text=Yeshiva%20and%20Mesifta,new%20Israeli%20currency.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G8oPM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G8oPM.png\" alt=\"Yeshivat Rabbeinu Shlomo Kluger flier for Chanukah gelt\" /></a></p>\n<p>The token in question probably looked something like this (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Shekel1976v9n2MarApr/page/n29/mode/2up?q=%22solomon%20kluger%20school%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>):\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pfiQe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pfiQe.png\" alt=\"Kluger Chanukah token\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

However, there is one who says that it is not practiced except in the Land, but outside of the Land fruits that are produced after the years of Orlah are over are permitted without redemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, practically, one must redeem the fourth year fruit without a beracha. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.294.7?lang=bi&with=Siftei%20Kohen&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.294.7?lang=bi&with=Ba%27er%20Hetev&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bear hativ</a>.)</p>\n<p>The opinion that there is no Neta Revai outside of Eretz Yisroel is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Foods.10.15?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam (Maachalos Asuros 10:15)</a>. He explains his reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יֵרָאֶה לִי שֶׁאֵין דִּין נֶטַע רְבָעִי נוֹהֵג בְּחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ אֶלָּא אוֹכֵל פֵּרוֹת שָׁנָה רְבִיעִית בְּלֹא פִּדְיוֹן כְּלָל שֶׁלֹּא אָמְרוּ אֶלָּא הָעָרְלָה. וְקַל וָחֹמֶר הַדְּבָרִים וּמַה סּוּרְיָא שֶׁהִיא חַיֶּבֶת בְּמַעַשְׂרוֹת וּבִשְׁבִיעִית מִדִּבְרֵיהֶם אֵינָהּ חַיֶּבֶת בְּנֶטַע רְבָעִי כְּמוֹ שֶׁיִּתְבָּאֵר בְּהִלְכוֹת מַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי. חוּצָה לָאָרֶץ לֹא כָּל שֶׁכֵּן שֶׁלֹּא יִהְיֶה נֶטַע רְבָעִי נוֹהֵג בָּהּ. אֲבָל בְּאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל נוֹהֵג בָּהּ בֵּין בִּפְנֵי הַבַּיִת בֵּין שֶׁלֹּא בִּפְנֵי הַבַּיִת</p>\n<p>...for they only said Orlah (is practiced outside of the Land). And it is a kal vachomer; if Syria, which has Ma'aser and Shevi'is on a Rabbinic level, doesn't have Neta Revai, as explained in Hilchos Ma'aser Sheni, (places farther) outside of the Land, certainly Neta Revai will not be practiced there. However, in the Land of Israel it is practiced both when the Temple is standing and when the Temple is not standing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Still working on this, but for now...)</p>\n<p>The next question is, can the Neta Revai be brought to Yerusalaim and eaten according to the opinion that it applies at all. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Second_Tithes_and_Fourth_Year%27s_Fruit.1.14?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam (Ma'aser Sheni 1:14)</a> says that it may not be brought to be eaten and may only be redeemed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי הוֹאִיל וְטָעוּן הֲבָאַת מָקוֹם אֵין מְבִיאִין אוֹתוֹ מִחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ כִּבְכוֹר בְּהֵמָה. לְפִיכָךְ לֹא חִיְּבוּ לְהַפְרִישׁ מַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי בְּסוּרְיָא. וְיֵרָאֶה לִי שֶׁמַּעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי שֶׁמַּפְרִישִׁים בְּאֶרֶץ שִׁנְעָר וּבְמִצְרַיִם פּוֹדִין אוֹתוֹ וּמְבִיאִין דָּמָיו לִירוּשָׁלַיִם. וְכֵן יֵרָאֶה לִי שֶׁלֹּא חִיְּבוּ מְקוֹמוֹת אֵלּוּ בְּמַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי אֶלָּא כְּדֵי לִקְבֹּעַ מַעֲשֵׂר עָנִי כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּהְיוּ עֲנִיֵּי יִשְׂרָאֵל סוֹמְכִים עֲלֵיהֶם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the Rambam according to his reasoning that there is no Maaser in Syria, but the other opinion about Maaser seems to disagree. For example the Raavid there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מעשר שני הואיל והוא טעון הבאת מקום כו' עד מעשר שני בסוריא. א''א אין הטעם הזה מספיק דר''ע הוא דס''ל הכי ולא אמר אלא ליקרב אבל לקדש מיהא קדוש והכי איתא בבכורות פ''ב ונ''ל מה שאמרו שאין מעשר שני בסוריא מן התורה קאמר ואם גזרו עליה מעשרות לא גזרו עליה נטע רבעי:</p>\n<p>ויראה לי שמע''ש וכו' עד סומכין עליהן. א''א אלו דברי רוח:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He theorized that traditions such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.91a.15?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the name of David's mother</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.91a.10?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the identification of Boaz with Ivtzan</a> and many many more such traditions in the Talmud, Midrash and even some Targums may have been part of Sefer Yochasin, which was a baraita to explain and expound upon the genealogies of Divrei Hayamim (per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.62b.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Pesachim.62b.8.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a>).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.62b.15?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 62b</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rami bar Rav Yuda said that Rav said the following about it: From the day the Book of Genealogies was hidden and no longer available to the Sages, the strength of the Sages has been weakened, and the light of their eyes has been dimmed, as the book contained the reasons for many Torah laws and lists of genealogies that are now lost.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is why was it hidden away? It seems like it contained important information, especially if Krauss's theory is to be accepted - bits of this information were certainly important enough to be included in the gemara! Especially as the gemara explains in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.91a.15?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Batra 91a</a> that this information was used when arguing with the minim about traditions of Judaism. If it was lost, why not write \"מיום <strong>שאבד</strong> ספר יוחסין\" (\"from the day that the Book of Genealogies was <strong>lost</strong>...\")?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Pesachim.62b.15.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi to Pesachim 62b</a> explains נגנז as נשתכח.

For the same reason, this list of lineages was hidden away and only taught orally and infrequently, before that practice also eventually stopped.</p>\n\n\n",

That epochal 1 Tishrei, however, is merely a theoretical construct used for calendrical calculations, not a point in the history of the Universe, which began on 25 Elul, 349 days \"later.\" (As the ephochal 1 Tishrei is assumed to be a Monday for these calculations, and the Creation of humanity is assumed to be a Friday, that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/75796/why-do-kisidran-years-only-occur-when-starting-on-a-tuesday-or-non-leap-thursday/75798#75798\">implies</a> a 354-day year.<sup>1</sup>) Therefore, for the purposes of this calculation, the calendar includes 349 theoretical days preceding Creation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>0.

    "content": "# What does \"omniscience\" really mean?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Standard teaching is that God is omniscient.  But what does the word mean?  To most, it means \"One who knows everything\".  To me, it means \"One who knows everything that there is to know\".  Some things are simply not there for anyone to know.</p>\n<p>Enter quantum mechanics, the most successful physical theory ever devised, predicting things correctly to seven significant figures.  It says that Schrödinger's cat is both alive and dead, and only observation can bring one of these two possibilities into reality.  Before observation, it is actually <em>wrong</em> to say \"the cat is either alive or dead\", because that statement leads to things different from what we observe in the laboratory.  So even God does not \"know\" whether \"the cat is alive or dead\", because that knowledge is simply not there to be had.</p>\n<p>So Rabbi Akiva's dictum, \"Everything is foreseen and free will is given\", means \"Everything [that there is to foresee, namely the probabilities of occurrence of various outcomes,] is foreseen, and free will is given [because we can influence that outcome]\".</p>\n<p>As I see it, all the \"infinity\" attributes of God reflect the influence of Greek philosophy.  They are not included in God's 13 attributes.  The Rambam was careful to say, in his 10th principle of faith, that God knows what people are doing NOW, but adds nothing about their future:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Tenth Foundation is that God, blessed be He, knows the actions of mankind and does not turn His eyes from them... \"Great in counsel, and mighty in work; for your eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men; to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings\" (Jeremiah 32:19).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, my question is:  Where, in traditional sources ancient and modern, is the definition of \"omniscience\" discussed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"No one, not even God, knows whether the cat is alive\" is technically true, according to Rambam. Right now it is not alive or dead and Rambam's formulation of God's \"knowledge\" is that which <em>exists</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God knows His own essence and, by knowing Himself, knows <em>all that\nexists</em> that proceeds from Him (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904962/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesodei HaTorah 2:9-10</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what exists for this cat? Something perfectly defined: a <em>superposition vector</em> and a <em>probability measure</em>.</p>\n<p>So how to read Rabbi Akiva's statement in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 3:15</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\"הַכֹּל צָפוּי\" – the entire space of possibilities; the wave function ψ (probability amplitudes etc) is known to Him - its full unitary evolution.</li>\n<li>\"וְהָרְשׁוּת נְתוּנָה\" – the collapse of ψ* (or branch‑selection for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Everett</a>**) still hinges on the act of the observer: observing/interacting or even\n<em>choosing</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can read this in line with several classic positions for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/856/do-we-really-have-free-choice/114432#114432\">free will</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911903/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 5:5</a>): God's knowledge is atemporal - it does not \"precede\" or \"follow\" our choices, and thus doesn't override free will.</li>\n<li>Raavad, Crescas, Albo: God does know which outcome will occur, yet His knowledge does not influence it.</li>\n<li>Ralbag, Kaspi: God's knowledge is only of what exists, so He \"knows\" outcomes only once they become ontologically existant - even if that moment is not \"after\" in any human sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It really starkly shows just how much we \"partner\" with Hashem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the Kabbalistic/Chassidic answer to this will add something. Ein Sof means \"infinite\" and as we learn in <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A1%22%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashana 5666</a> (read it <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/58811\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) et al., this is a misnomer. The term \"Ein Sof\" is meant to mean <em>lifnei ha-hagdarah</em>; beyond all categories and definitions totally, beyond infinite/finite, beyond being/not-being, actual/potential. All states of perfection are already present \"within\" Him because they are <em>from</em> Him (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gevurot_Hashem%2C_Second_Introduction_to_Gevurot_Hashem.2?ven=hebrew%7CGevurot_Hashem,_with_footnotes_and_annotations_by_Rabbi_Yehoshua_D._Hartman,_Machon_Yerushalyim,_2015-2020&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gevurot Hashem Hakdama 2</a>).</p>\n<p>Therefore, on the level where Hashem \"allows\" Himself to know (the Sefirot of Atzilut - see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4094498/jewish/Mitzvas-Haamanas-Elokus-Section-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha Ha'amanut Elokut 4-6</a>), the answer is as above.

Words such as omniscience and omnipresent are not in the bible. Maimonides writes that it is philosophically impossible to know anything at all about G-d, save negatives, such as G-d does not have a body, is neither male nor female, etc. Thus the idea that G-d is all-knowing may not be true.</p>\n<p>Abraham ibn Ezra felt that G-d only knows the generalities, the rules of the laws of nature, but not the particular details. Ralbag, like many others, felt that Divine knowledge is not aware of all the details about people; G-d only knows what might occur. Some scholars even think the Rambam held this view also. For example, Rambam's 10th principle, as you write, says that \"G-d knows what people are doing NOW, but adds nothing about their future.\" Is he saying that G-d does not know humans, people as individuals?</p>\n<p>Maimonides writes that G-d cannot do everything. He cannot make a  square-circle, for example. The first principle of faith:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G-d exists, is eternal, is perfect in every way and is the cause of\nall existence, but He cannot do impossible things such as turning a\ntriangle into a square.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many verses in  Scripture seem to imply that G-d does know or is unaware of the situation. For example, after Noah's flood, we are told that “His heart was saddened.” This has caused some scholars to ask the question, “Does G-d regret?” Another example is the famed trial of Abraham in Genesis 22 (Akedah, the binding of Isaac). Why did G-d felt the need to test Abraham? Isn't He all-wise? Didn’t G-d know the outcome of the test? Isn't G-d all-knowing? What does the word test even mean? Rambam seems to say that G-d did not test Abraham, it was an internal struggle. “G-d tested Abraham” by the laws of nature.</p>\n<p>Maimonides writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The sole object of all the trials mentioned in Scripture is to teach\nman what he ought to do or believe…. This is the way how we must\nunderstand the accounts of trial; we must not think that G-d desires\nto examine us and to try us in order to know what He did not know\nbefore. Far be this from Him; He is above that which ignorant and\nfoolish people imagine concerning Him, in the evil of their thoughts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He later quotes Rabbi Ishmael, “The Torah speaks in human terms.” Radak agreed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“When it says that He ‘regretted,’ this is the Torah speaking in human\nterms, for in truth, ‘He is not human that He should change his mind\n[le-hinahem]’ (I Sam. 15:29), for in the Almighty there is no change\nof will.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Based on Rambam and sages' interpretation of Biblical passages, Divine omniscience means that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For every event X in the Creation in time t, the statement<br />\n\"God knew that X, in time t - t1\" is true, for any positive t1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A star shall shoot forth out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel… A ruler shall come out of Jacob... [Numbers 24:12-19]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage is understood by all commentators to refer to the future Messiah.  The prophet Isaiah elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government is upon his shoulder.  His name shall be “Wonderful Counselor of the Mighty God, of the Everlasting Father, of the Prince of Peace”. [His mission shall be] to increase government, establish unending peace upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, and uphold it through justice and righteousness from that time forth and forevermore.  [Isaiah 9:5-6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, Isaiah adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And there shall come forth a rod from the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow from his roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord... And he shall not judge by what his eyes see, nor decide by what his ears hear, but he shall judge with righteousness... and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked...\nAnd the wolf shall dwell with the lamb\nAnd the leopard shall lie down with the kid\nAnd the calf and the young lion and the fatling together\nAnd a little child shall lead them.\nAnd the cow and the bear shall feed.<br />\nTheir young ones shall lie down together.<br />\nAnd the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\nAnd the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp.\nAnd the weaned child shall put his hand in the vipers' den.\nThey shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse... To which the nations shall seek... And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again, the second time, to recover the remnant of his people... and He shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth... Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not harass Ephraim. [Isaiah 11:1-13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The questioner is correct, there is no explicit commandment in the Bible/Torah to believe in a Messiah. And if someone bases religious requirements as: statements or commandments within the Torah/Bible; then there is no \"need\" to believe in a Messiah. The Torah has no outright mentions of a Messiah, and while others mention a \"hint\" of the Messiah in the Torah I find this hint to be far fetched.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[I] heard the words of God, and know the knowledge of the most High,\n[and] saw the vision of the Almighty... A star shall shoot forth out\nof Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel… A ruler shall come\nout of Jacob... [Numbers 24:12-19]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure the above statement from the Torah could be referring to a Messiah.... Or it could just be referring to a Kingship coming from the line of Judah, which I think reflects the words of the prophecy much more, and is still impressive considering the nation of Israel has no king and won't for hundreds of years. But to then say this hint must apply to a Messiah instead of a king from Judah seems like too much of a stretch to me.</p>\n<p>However, the concept of the Messiah is one of the longest ongoing concepts in Judaism, with Messianic \"hints\" increasing toward the closing of the Tanakh. Byy the time of the Mishnah, belief in a Messiah is so common it can be considered a central tenet of \"normative Judaism\" from then til today. We even find outside religious sources such as Josephus discussing a Messiah. Fast forward close to a thousand years and belief in a Messiah is codified as one of Rambam's principles of faith, which a lot of Jews believe is a definitive list of belief requirements. So in the year 2021 it would be hard to be taken seriously as a religious Jew if you didn't believe in a Messiah.</p>\n<p>But from a strictly Torah commandment perspective, I cannot find even a worthwhile hint of a Messiah or a required belief in one from the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>According to Rashi, Rav Joseph did not call Rabbi Hillel a heretic when Hillel said that the messiah will not come.

    "title": "Were the Talmudic Sages fools according to R. Saadia Gaon?",
    "content": "# Were the Talmudic Sages fools according to R. Saadia Gaon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Emunot V’Deiot (7:5) R. Saadia Gaon writes the following, with regard to some verses in Chapter Nine of Ecclesiastes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[An example,] again, of the third type [of verses presenting difficulty so far as the doctrine of resurrection is concerned] is such a statement as: <em>For him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, etc.... As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is long ago perished, etc.</em> (Eccles. 9:4-6). Now although these three verses were pronounced by the sage, they do not represent his personal opinion. They are rather a quotation of the view of the foolish, because they are preceded by an account of the agitation aroused in the hearts of the foolish by his condition. He says, namely: <em>Yea also, the heart of the sons of of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead</em> (Eccles. 9:3).</p>\n<p>Then, after having first stated that men have <em>evil and madness</em> in their hearts by reason of their life as well as of death, he explains what is actually in their hearts by expressing it in the three [subsequent] verses. The import of these verses is that, in the opinion of these fools, a living dog is better than a dead lion and that the living know what they are going forward to but the dead do not know anything, for all their activities are over and they have no more portion in this world.</p>\n<p>Since, however, the sage does not make these statements before prefacing them with the observation that they represent the agitations of the fools and their evils, <strong>therefore whoever adheres to these views is a fool, a person who does not turn toward God and does not prepare to meet, aye who does not draw near, the presence of the light of his Master.</strong> For men of <em>evil and madness</em> stand aside from God, as it is said: <em>Evil shall not sojourn with Thee. Madmen shall not stand in Thy sight</em> (Ps. 5:5,6).\n(Rosenblatt translation p. 275, italics in original, bold added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Talmud (Berachot 18b) appears to accept the truth of these verses, as it cites them as proof that the dead do not know what goes on in this world:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Hiyya and R. Jonathan were once walking about in a cemetery, and the blue fringe of R. Jonathan was trailing on the ground. Said R. Hiyya to him: Lift it up, so that they [the dead] should not say: Tomorrow they are coming to join us and now they are insulting us! <strong>He said to him: Do they know so much? Is it not written, But the dead know not anything?</strong> He replied to him: If you have read once, you have not repeated; if you have repeated, you have not gone over a third time; if you have gone over a third time, you have not had it explained to you. For the living know that they shall die: these are the righteous who in their death are called living as it says. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a living man from Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down and also slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow. ‘The son of a living man’: are all other people then the sons of dead men? Rather ‘the son of a living man’ means that even in his death he was called living. ‘From Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds’: this indicates that he gathered [kibbez] numerous workers for the Torah. ‘He smote two altar-hearths of Moab’; this indicates that he did not leave his like either in the first Temple or in the second Temple.   ‘He went down and also slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow’: some say that this indicates that he broke blocks of ice and went down and bathed; others say that he went through the Sifra of the School of Rab on a winter's day. <strong>‘But the dead know nothing’: These are the wicked who in their lifetime are called dead, as it says. And thou, O wicked one, that art slain, the prince of Israel.</strong></p>\n<p>(Soncino translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While it is true that the proof from the verse was rejected, it was only on account of it being a misinterpretation of what the verse meant, not that the entire source was inadmissible as the view of the fool.</p>\n<p>According to R. Saadia Gaon, then, are the Talmudic Sages fools for accepting the views portrayed in Ecclesiastes?</p>\n<p>Or did R. Saadia Gaon only mean that the value judgement expressed was that of the fool, but the underlying fact that the dead know nothing is still true?</p>\n<p>Or was R. Saadia Gaon perhaps merely  polemicizing for the purpose if his theological point, but would in reality agree with the Talmud?</p>\n<p>Is this potential conflict discussed in subsequent rabbinic literature?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Prerequisites for attending Yeshiva as a middle aged Baal Teshuva\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are the prerquisites for attending yeshiva for the first time as a middle aged man without a strong background in Yiddishkeit? The yeshiva graduates I've meet seem very intelligent, does one need to be at that level to study at a yeshiva, particularly as concerns yeshivot geared towards baalei teshuva?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are many yeshivot geared specifically to both Israeli and foreign balei teshuva in Jerusalem. Admissions criteria vary, but in general their mission is to educate Jews and they are not selective. It would certainly help to have a command of the aleph-bet (Hebrew alphabet) and some knowledge of Chumash (the five books of Moses) before entering a yeshiva, but the only hard and fast rule is that you must be willing to keep Shabbat. Most of the time you will be living in a dorm and/or attending meals and shiurim on Shabbat, and I don't think a single yeshiva would tolerate on-site Melacha Shabbat. Kashrut is not so much of a problem- all yeshivot provide meals, and you can be reasonably confident they're kosher- but you would do best not to be seen eating a dairy ice cream after a meaty lunch!</p>\n<p>In terms of raw intellect, the Torah meets everyone at their level. I have seen very learned people in secular subjects struggle with Torah learning, I have seen people who seem rather simple grasp Torah concepts with ease, and everything in between, and, most remarkably, I have seen people who were clearly not born with the highest possible level of innate intellectual ability who have become truly brilliant through years of Torah study. The key is bending your own mind to the Torah rather than trying to bend the Torah to your mind. I.e. accepting, for example, that not keeping chametz in your home over Pesach is not \"stupid\" or \"outdated\" but rather that G-d and our sages know and understand something that you don't. This is not an admissions prerequisite but will certainly bring you much success.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the intro of Jose Faur's dissertation on the \"Guide for the Perplexed\" (thanks Alex) it says: A dimension of Hebrew perfection is the desire to share it with others.</p>\n<p>In that regard, there will be a place for you. I don't know what stage of life you're in, but as a bal ha'bais, I would go to a local yeshiva several times a week. Fortunately a brilliant bucher was willing to teach me.</p>\n<p>On a practical note, I would echo what Josh K said above. You might consider taking some steps on your own as preparation and also to see how much intellectual effort you're willing to commit.</p>\n<p>Not that you should necessarily do as I did, but you might begin by teaching yourself lashon kodesh (the Hebrew of the Chumash). There are several such books available, many more so than what I used 40 years ago. Then you can try to translate some of the early parshahs - quite an uplifting experience. Also I used Brown, Driver and Briggs Lexicon which can give you a breadth of the meanings( <a href=\"https://hebrewcollege.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BDB.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewcollege.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BDB.pdf</a>) and a grammar (I used Gesenius - <a href=\"http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/GeseniusGrammar.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/GeseniusGrammar.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p>You can also access a number of daily mishna shiurim on-line.</p>\n<p>These are foundational yet exalted. However, in my personal experience, once in the yeshiva curriculum, the focus was on gemara. As you may know that is largely in Aramaic. I preferred to learn l'iyun - which is a glacial pace (along with the commentaries of Rashi and Tosfos found in the side margins of each page (daf).</p>\n<p>Studying at that pace, you can do a small section at a time, and really get the flavor (tam Gan Eden). No need to get anywhere - ayn l'dovar sof (no end to the matter) and \"swimming in the sea of Talmud\" are applicable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Only attend one that has classes in basic Torah Judaism: introductory halacha, Hebrew, introduction to the mitzvos, a forum for questions, Mishnah. Some places just toss you into a Gemara shiur and don't even give an introduction to that. Consider staying in America. Toras Dovid in Monsey is a possibility as are the Chabad institutions in NJ, Miami, and Brooklyn. There's also Shar Yashuv in Far Rockaway, NY. Going to Israel is too much for some people. The environment there is very intense, and you'll hear all kinds of propaganda of how you should never leave the yeshiva or Israel. You might also consider just going at night or attending classes online. There are zillions of on-line classes. Disruption of one's life to go full-time is not productive for some people and once you move into the yeshiva building, it's not so easy to leave even if you don't like what you hear there.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, the Nazir himself is holy, and the hair is holy, and each one is mentioned in its own verse.</p>\n<p>You see the holiness of the hair in that it is burned with the offerings the Nazir brings at the conclusion of his Nezirus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Nazir shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is true that other sources in Chazal apply the verse to the Nazir himself, but Rashi in his commentary to Chumash relies very heavily on the Sifri, since it was actually written on the Chumash itself.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Rosh in his commentary to Nazir says that Rav Mattana's interpretation is not a real halachic interpretation (which have to be rooted in the 13 methods of Rabbi Yishmael) but an <em>asmachta</em>, or mnemonic for memorization. Maimonides says the same in his commentary to the Mishnah. The rules for these mnemonics are looser than for full halachic interpretations.</p>\n<p>And finally, Rav Mattana is only coming to show <em>how long</em> the period of Nezirus must be. That is valid even if he agrees to Rashi that the verse refers to the hair; you still see the time period is thirty days.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is being Jewish a race / ethnicity or a religion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I am genuinely interested, whether Jewish people identify as an ethnicity / race, or as \"religious people\" (of any race, i.e. as \"Christians\": not tied to any particular race).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a non-Jewish man becomes a believer in Judaism, will he then become a \"Jew\"?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Both and a third option as a nationality.</p>\n<p>It is an ethnicity in the sense that being born or raised in a Jewish community comes with a culture attached; a community-specific language-variant, shared historical and cultural symbols, food and norms. What exactly makes 'ethnicity' is difficult to define, but if we define it as a grouping of people who identify with each other based on ingroup-destinguishing attributes such as traditions, ancestry, language, history, culture, religion, or social treatment then Jews as a people check of all these boxes.</p>\n<p>Jewish ethnicity is also defined by its religion, in many ways because Jewish religion is community centred. Jewish religion is designed to be practice communally, and is not what many secular people now often think of religion, namely an individual philosophy you live behind your front door. Jewish religion shapes all aspects of an observant Jew's life from the food that is eaten to the way shoelaces are tied.</p>\n<p>You can be part of the Jewish ethnicity without yourself being religious, because the religion has shaped the ethnicity. You can speak Jewish lingo, grow up with Jewish food, music and history without being religious. But religion is an important aspect of being a religious Jew and being one means you become part of a sub-ethnicity within the larger Jewish ethnicity.</p>\n<p>Jews are a nation, because not only were we a literal nation with a King and whatnot, but entry to the Jewish religion also means entry to the Jewish ethnicity (at least in Jewish eyes). This is more than just 'religion'. Some religions evangelize and deem it important to convert the world. Jewish religion does not view the world this way. In Jewish thought, every non-jewish 'nation' has its own intrinsic value and mission in the world. It is not an inherently good thing for non-jews to become jewish. To become Jewish you have to demonstrate a willingness to be part of the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>To become Jewish is similar in many ways to how one becomes a Dutch or US citizen: you apply for citizenship, you demonstrate that you have knowledge of important things that would make you an effective citizens, such as important laws or cultural norms, and as soon as you are okayed, you get your passport and from that point onward you are a citizen of that nation. This means that all laws applied to its citizens now also apply to you. So transgressing laws of kashrut, such as eating cheeseburgers, will now be put on your record. The main difference with Jews is that your Jewish citenship is applied retroactively.</p>\n<p>Note (to answer one of your specific questions): merely adopting Jewish religion is not sufficient to become a Jew. You still have to apply for citizenship so to say. How the conversion process works is very time and community specific, but generally you approach a Rabbi, actively live in a Jewish community, learn Judaism and eventually, if it is decided (by the relevant religious authorities) that you are ready to become a sincere observant Jew, than your citizenship will be made official. Browse this site for excellent questions and answers going into details about this process.</p>\n<p>So, to summarize. Yes.</p>\n\n\n",

Second, I don't see in Sarah's request any hint on sending them to die in the desert. Third, God didn't add anything to Sarah's words. Fourth, Abraham only \"sent her away\", presumably from his household, without insisting on facing their death in the desert.</p>\n<p>Except for fitting the narrative, why would Hagar choose an inevitable and horrible death for her and her son in the desert instead of staying in cities or coming back to her father?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.14?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.21.14.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> on the passuk writes two noteworthy points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bread and a skin of water.

She went and lost her way. Avraham gave her sufficient supplies to reach Beer Sheva had she not become lost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So on the one hand according to the Ibn Ezra, the passuk only lists a very meagre handout from Avraham to show how he was acting on Sarah's instructions, but later after Sarah's death he went out of his way to give them suitable gifts. On the other hand, alternatively, he did supply them with other things and Hagar was suitably supplied to get to Be'er Sheva but they did not account for her getting lost.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.14?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.21.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> adds that he did not leave her completely in the lurch.

He gave her also silver and gold so that she could replenish her supplies, although the Torah did not make a specific mention of this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, I would argue that Hagar did not choose 'an inevitable and horrible death' this was part of her being expelled from the household.

He foresaw that the Ishmaelites would hate the Jews more than any other nation on earth hated them. Avraham was careful not to deny Hagar and Ishmael the necessities to ensure their survival, something with which Jews provide even their enemies.

He who learns from every man. [Avot 4:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does it mean?</p>\n<p>(1) That every individual who enters your life, in person or from afar, has something useful to teach you.</p>\n<p>(2) That you should go out of your way to seek out people, especially people who are very different from you, because they know some wisdom you don't know.</p>\n<p>Most people would say (1).  But is (2) to be rejected out of hand?  Should you try to learn, say, about other religions, other cultures, in case their different point of view might add positively to yours?  The danger is that they may lead you astray, and you may not know enough to take the good and reject the bad.</p>\n<p>In the Talmud, God refuses to quote the opinions of Rabbi Meir because Rabbi Meir learned from Acher, the heretic.  Then a rabbi told God there is nothing wrong with taking the good and rejecting the bad, as Meir did.  God accepts that teaching and starts quoting Rabbi Meir. [Ḥagigah 15b] (One of the many times God is \"taught\" and accepts the teaching saying, \"לִמַּדְתַּנִי – <em>Lamadtani!</em> You have taught Me!\" [see, e.g., Numbers Rabbah 19:33].)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir knew how to recognize the good from the bad, but you and I may not.  So is my (2) out of the question?  But that situation would occur also in my (1).  So what is the resolution?  How far should one go in trying to \"learn from every person\"?</p>\n\n\n",

What should one eat for <em>seudah shelishit</em>? (I am aware that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Magen_Avraham.444.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 444:1</a> suggests also eating <em>seudah shelishit</em> in the morning in this case; leave that to one side.)</p>\n<p>For Ashkenazim (who are not accustomed to eat <em>matzah ashirah</em>) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.444.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rema to Orach Chaim 444:1</a> recommends eating fruit, meat or fish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Magen_Avraham.444.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 444:2</a> quotes Maharil who wrote that in theory it would be right to use cooked <em>matzah</em> for this meal, but he has not seen that this is customary practice. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.444.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 444:8</a> writes that one can use cooked <em>matzah</em> products for this meal.</p>\n<p>Inasmuch as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.291.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 291:5</a> sounds like using <em>mezonot</em> products for <em>seudah shelishit</em> is preferable to using meat, fish or fruit, is it better to use cooked <em>matzah</em> for this meal? If that is the case, does anyone explain why Rema omitted it? Or Maharil's observation that this is not the custom? Or why Mishnah Berurah presents it as an option, without seeming to endorse it?</p>\n<p>Alternatively, are there any reasons not to use cooked <em>matzah</em> for this meal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question. Common knowledge would seem to indicate that there is no problem with eating cooked matza since you definitely can't use it for the seder and that Mezonot-foods seem to be preferred to other non-bread options for the Third Sabbath Meal generally. So why was this not the obvious solution for Erev Pesach (EP)? Why was no one doing this and instead eating meat and fruits? To defend all those people, here are a few ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crushed cooked matza may have been prohibited by a different custom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rama (471:2) quotes a custom (of which he disapproves, but apparently existed) that forbids crushing matza on EP. A different custom prohibits porridge-like foods on Shabbat EP (444:3) lest it be hard to clean the pots. In principle neither of these customs need apply to cooking matza before Shabbat EP for use on Shabbat, since the crushing is happening earlier and the pot here doesn't need to be cleaned, but perhaps this explains why people refrained from utilizing your suggestion. (Matza balls are not a porridge but it's not unusual to find undercooked matza in the center of a dense ball, so from that perspective a porridge would have been preferred.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps cooked matza is still forbidden on EP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is it so obvious that cooked matza is permitted on EP? Just because the reason of the prohibition may not apply perfectly? Would anyone think you can eat Pat Akum if you've dipped it in your soup so it's no longer technically proper bread?</p>\n<p>One conception of such a prohibition is that the prohibition on eating matza on EP was always intended to include matza-like foods and not only foods that could literally be used for the mitzva at the seder. Indeed, were this not the case, we could find much better solutions for our Shabbat meal than cooked matza, like matza baked with the intention of not using it at the seder since matza for the seder must be made \"lishmah\". (Maharsha (Pesachim 99b) explicitly rejects that option and R' Shlomo Kluger (HaElef 322) extends his argument to cooked matza.) Indeed so many Rishonim say explicitly that there is no Pat (bread/matza/hamotzi) that can be used on EP afternoon except matza ashira for those who eat it. Note as well that Rabbenu Tam's allowance of matza ashira on EP is quoted in early sources almost as a novelty. Did no one think of that before Rabbbenu Tam? Perhaps that too was close enough to have been inappropriate for consumption so close to the seder itself. This is indeed how the Vilna Gaon (commentary to 444:1) interprets the Rambam's position. See too <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ateret_Zekenim_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.444.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ateret Zekeinim OC 444:1</a> that some prohibit matza ashira on EP.</p>\n<p>Another conception of such a prohibition is that the prohibition on eating matza on EP indeed only applies to bona fide seder-worthy matza, but once prohibited the food can't lose its prohibition. We see this idea in two ways. First, Rama (471:2) writes that crushed up matza mixed with egg or honey can't be eaten on EP because it doesn't convert to become matza ashira after it was baked kosher originally. Many, many later authorities (eg. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37572&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshivat Nafesh OC 4</a>) struggled with this rule since it seems obvious that such a cake would not be considered bread by any rule. Arguably, the prohibition is such that once it attaches to an object it doesn't leave. Secondly, some (eg. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Responsa_Rav_Pealim%2C_Volume_III%2C_Orach_Chayim.27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Pealim 3:27</a> quoting <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1120&st=&pgnum=139\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit David 248</a>) rule that matza cooked <em>on EP</em> remains prohibited for this reason since the prohibition already took effect. While that won't matter for EP on Shabbat since everything must be cooked before Shabbat, it's not hard to imagine an extension to that position which assumes the status of matza takes effect even before the prohibition is relevant, not unlike how chametz before pesach is considered by many to be a prohibited substance regarding kashering vessels (OC 451:4). See too Yehuda Ya'aleh YD 4, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1120&pgnum=138\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit David OC 247</a>, Yosef Ometz 729, and Da'at Torah (Maharsham) OC 444:1.</p>\n<p>Finally, while cooked matza indeed can't be used for the mitzva at night, bread that was cooked and then baked is still fully bread (like a bagel, OC 168:14) so arguably cooked matza is still potentially usable at night and hence should remain prohibited.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Perhaps meat is actually better than cooked matza crumbs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The opinion that allows not using bread for the third meal allows the meal to be fulfilled with types of food called \"Targima\" (Tur OC 291). Targima foods show up in three halachic contexts: The Talmud (27a) tells us that Targima can be used for the minimum number of meals in a Sukkah (according to the opinion that there is such a minimum) and [arguably] by extension the minimum number of meals on Shabbat, by implication we see Targima is obligated to be consumed in a Sukkah, and the Talmud (Pesachim 107b) tells us Targima foods are not subject to the prohibition of eating substantive food on EP late in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>There is a three way dispute what counts as Targima foods: 1) cooked grains (תבשיל דגן‏), 2) meat, cheese, legumes and things that are eaten with bread (מלפפין הפת‏), 3) fruits. Most Rishonim hold of opinion 2, while some hold of 3 and a few hold of 1. (The main proponent of 1 is the Rosh and thereby his son the Tur and they base themselves off a variant version of a Tosefta which is not found in most manuscripts or our printed editions. 2 and 3 are commonly known as the positions of Rabbenu Peretz and Maharam respectively.)</p>\n<p>(<strong>Note</strong> cooked grains are not the same as cakes/crackers: the latter is a type of snack bread that can be considered bread when eaten as a meal; whether or not cakes/crackers can count for the third Sabbath meal <strong>as bread</strong> without establishing them as a full meal with the blessings Hamotzi/Hamazon is a dispute among Rishonim, but is irrelevant to our question which is about fulfilling the third meal not through bread. Don't get confused by the similar blessing of Mezonot.)</p>\n<p>I listed them in that order because it's likely those who hold 2 or 3 would agree that the items before theirs would be at least as sufficiently substantive as their position. Thus, for the third Sabbath meal, it's best to use definition 1 since all would seemingly agree it qualifies as Targima. This is seemingly why the Shulchan Aruch lists out all the options in that order in his discussion of the third Sabbath meal (OC 291:5). For eating EP late in the afternoon though the stricter opinion is 3 since if 3 is Targima and permitted, foods of type 1 and 2 would plausibly be prohibited as too substantive.</p>\n<p>Thus, for the Rama who is generally strict (OC 639:3) about eating EP afternoon even after 6 hours not just 9 hours, he has little reason to risk eating matza balls to accommodate a minority opinion about what constitutes Targima (which is itself relying on an extreme minority opinion that Targima counts at all for the third Shabbat meal) at the expense of violating a prohibition of eating that same food at that time. Even for those who aren't strict from 6 hours on, the spirit of the prohibition clearly dictates against eating heavy cooked matza balls in the afternoon, and that may be enough to dispense with being strict for this minority opinion (so suggests Arukh HaShulchan 444:5).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Certainly it's much easier to argue for the permissive side here to allow eating matza balls and we are talking about \"only\" a rabbinic prohibition so it's hard to argue too strongly to be strict. But also realize that many great people in great communities did not think that was necessary and it isn't 100% clear it's even permitted. Even if the reason to miss out on the third Shabbat meal that week is just customary prohibitions on certain permitted foods (a weaker claim than those who claim there is no command to eat a third meal), Jewish law clearly (OC 288:2-4) exempts one who is practically unable to eat a Shabbat meal from doing so, such as one with a medical condition rendering such consumption uncomfortable or due to a voluntary fast. There is little reason to worry that the obligation to eat a third meal should force one to eat traditionally proscribed food.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sub> You asked about matza balls, but really the stronger question, mentioned by R' Akiva Eiger 471:2, is from cooked whole matza since it is still Hamotzi. Put two sheets of matza in boiling chicken soup for a few minutes on Friday, take them out whole, and use them as Lechem Mishneh on Shabbat afternoon. This is indeed Rav Ovadia Yosef's recommendation (Yechavveh Daat 1:91, Yabia Omer 6:39). The Targima discussion seemingly wouldn't apply here, so the only excuse we could have to not do that is either accept the above suggestions of a more expansive EP prohibition on matza, a much more reasonable argument for whole sheets of matza which do very much resemble regular matza (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3273&st=&pgnum=259\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chiddushei Gr\"i Pesachim 56</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chokhmat_Shlomo_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.471.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chokhmat Shelomo OC 471</a> that the prohibition is indeed linked to a status as a kind of bread), or question (as does Da'at Torah (Maharsham) OC 444:1 and Gan HaMelekh 64) to what extent whole boiled matza remains Hamotzi when the \"matza\" is a modern matza-cracker instead of a classic \"soft\" matza.</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Great question!</p>\n<p>I came across this <a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/erev-pesach-shabbat-problems-solutions-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which is quite insightful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most acute problem that Erev Pesach on Shabbat poses is fulfilling the requirement of eating Seudah Shlishit (the third meal of Shabbat). Though there are opinions that fish and meat or even fruits may be used for Seudah Shlishit the accepted ruling of the Shulchan Aruch is to eat bread unless that is impossible. Ideally the third meal should be eaten after midday (to be precise from the time of Mincha about half an hour after mid-day) though on this Shabbat bread is prohibited at that time. The Shulchan Aruch suggests the use of egg or fruit juice matzot. These should be eaten before the tenth hour of the day so that one will have a proper appetite at night for the matzah. The Rama writes that in Ashkenazik communities such matzot are not eaten on Pesach and they should not be used after the time Chametz is prohibited. (For a different understanding of the Rama see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.444.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan OC 444/5</a>) <strong>He therefore states that we should treat this as a situation where bread can’t be eaten and suffice with fruits or meat</strong>. (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.444.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 444/2</a> and Aruch Hashulchan for discussion on whether meat or fruit are preferable for this purpose.)</p>\n<p>Other suggestions are to eat two meals with bread or matzah made with egg or fruit juice before the time Chametz is prohibited. Though this means that the third meal is eaten before midday, according to this opinion eating bread takes precedence. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.444.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berurah 444/8</a>) <strong>Alternately one may use cooked matzah such as matzah balls (knaidlach) though most poskim write that this option was never accepted</strong>.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Finally it should be noted that there is an opinion, based on the Zohar, that exempts one from eating the third meal on this Shabbat</strong>. The basis of this opinion is that as on Yom Kipur, which comes out on Shabbat, there is no requirement to eat three meals, so too on this Shabbat there would be no need for a third meal. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.444.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan 444/6</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This appears to be the advice of Star-K <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/seasonal/pesach/app/371/a-guide-to-erev-shabbos-that-occurs-on-pesach/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

It seems to contradict the earlier mishna (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kilayim.4.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:5</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַנּוֹטֵעַ שׁוּרָה שֶׁל חָמֵשׁ גְּפָנִים, בֵּית שַׁמַּאי אוֹמְרִים, כֶּרֶם. וּבֵית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים, אֵינוֹ כֶרֶם, עַד שֶׁיְּהוּ שָׁם שְׁתֵּי שׁוּרוֹת. לְפִיכָךְ, הַזּוֹרֵעַ אַרְבַּע אַמּוֹת שֶׁבַּכֶּרֶם, בֵּית שַׁמַּאי אוֹמְרִים, קִדֵּשׁ שׁוּרָה אַחַת. וּבֵית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים, קִדֵּשׁ שְׁתֵּי שׁוּרוֹת:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the latter mishna, when kila'im are planted within 4 amos of a vineyard, Beis Hillel say this destroys 2 rows, but Beis Shammai say only one row (because this is consistent with their respective definitions of what is a vineyard). Even according to Beis Hillel here, the blast radius is no more than 2 rows, i.e. 4 amos into the vineyard. Yet in mishna 5:5 above, kila'im in the middle of the vineyard destroy everything within 16 amos!</p>\n<p>I saw an explanation in Kehati that this is because for the קרחת הכרם (an empty patch inside the vineyard) you need 16 amos to permit planting other species in the middle. But that explanation is unsatisfactory on two counts: 1) the 16 amos there is across the <em>entire</em> area, so it should be diameter, not a radius and 2) in the case of the empty patch you are allowed to plant 8 amos square within the 16 amos, leaving a gap of only 4 amos from the vines on each side!</p>\n<p>If I hadn't seen this mishna, I would have prohibited no more than 4 amos radius from where the kila'im were planted. Or maybe, taking into account Beis Hillel's view that a vineyard is at least 2 rows, I would require two rows to be destroyed from the epicenter.

Sefer HaChinuch was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">based off</a> the Rambam's list. So why are they different?</p>\n<p>For example, you scroll to the bottom of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a>, it gives the Rambam's list in both his order (which is what, exactly?) and order in terms of appearance in the Torah. However, the last mitzvah in Sefer HaChinuch is to write a sefer Torah, while it's 612 (not 613) according the that order. Why is this the case? If the Chinuch is basd of the Rambam, and the Chinuch is chronological, wouldn't listing the Rambam's list in chronological order produce the same list twice?</p>\n<p>Also, for example, the first mitzvah listed in the Torah (per Chinuch) is procreation. The above list has it at 125. Is there a reason the Rambam places it where he does?</p>\n<p>So is the Chinuch's list the same as the Rambam's or are the 613 mitzvot different in these two sefarim? And why is the order so different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch writes at the beginning of his work that he based his list off of the Rambam's. Meaning, any <em>mitzvah</em> that the Rambam lists, the Chinuch makes a point of doing so as well.</p>\n<p>That does not mean that they are in the same order. The Sefer HaChinuch writes that he wrote his work as a means to get his son excited about the weekly <em>parsha</em>. Therefore, he \"reordered\" the <em>mitzvos</em> of the Rambam by <em>parsha</em>. The original edition had all the positive <em>mitzvos</em> in each <em>parsha</em> listed first, and then the negative <em>mitzvos</em> in that <em>parsha</em>. Subsequent editions made it entirely chronological.</p>\n<p>The Rambam however doesn't list his work by <em>parsha</em>. They seem to be more ordered by theme, where for example he groups together Temple <em>mitzvos</em> and forbidden foods, etc. The exact reasoning for his ordering is unknown. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/15291\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">One work</a> makes an attempt at figuring it out, but it's all speculation. More on this is found in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/101868/1739\">this question</a>.</p>\n<p>There are however <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/84101/1739\">some discrepancies</a> between the two works. Besides the one I linked to, another example which may produce the issue you're seeing is there are many verses which could be sources for a <em>mitzvah</em>. The Rambam often lists more than one. The Chinuch therefore felt free to choose whichever source he felt best represented the <em>mitzvah</em>. This means that he might list a <em>mitzvah</em> \"earlier\" than the Rambam would have, had the latter's been chronological.</p>\n<p>One example that comes to mind is the Rambam sources many <em>mitzvos</em> related to the holidays in <em>parshas Pinchas</em> (the end of Numbers), whereas the Chinuch cites them from verses in <em>parshas Emor</em> (in Leviticus).</p>\n<p>Regarding the specific case you mention, they have the Rambam listing his <em>mitzvah</em> against drinking wine that was used for idol worship as his last <em>mitzvah</em>. That's because he lists the source for it as Deuteronomy 32:38. The Chinuch however when he lists this <em>mitzvah</em> (#111), he cites Exodus 34:12,15 as the source. That verse is referring to food of idol worship, and the Chinuch includes in that wine of idol worship.</p>\n\n\n",

We picked Pirkei Avoth because a lot of it is not very complicated, and there are many good translations available out there.  We used Artscroll's <em>Children's Pirkei Avos</em> and a standard, Artscroll Hebrew-English Siddur.  In general we used Sefaria.org for our learning, which made it easier, but of course on Shabbath we couldn't.

Presumably this appointment was by local leadership and/or the local court. From there, he might advance in rank and eventually reach the Great Sanhedrin in the Chamber of Hewn Stone. Examples for such cases can be seen from Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai who was a posek in the Galilee for many years before moving to Yerushalayim, according to Buchler, presumably because he was made a member of one of the higher courts and perhaps also Rabbi Yochanan ben Hachoranit<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shalom Albeck</a> in his book \"Batei Hadin Bimei Hatalmud\" (The Courts In The Time of the Talmud) notes that the local courts' power came from the people, meaning, there were no laws to compel people to come be judged in front of the local courts. Rather, the local courts were more like halachic advisors that were also available for judicial proceedings, should cases be brought before them. As such, the appointment of these sages as judges was no different than the appointment of other religious figures within every community, as defined in the baraita in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.17b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 17b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And it is taught in a baraita: A Torah scholar is not permitted to reside in any city that does not have these ten things: A court that has the authority to flog and punish transgressors; and a charity fund for which monies are collected by two people and distributed by three, as required by halakha. This leads to a requirement for another three people in the city. And a synagogue; and a bathhouse; and a public bathroom; a doctor; and a bloodletter; and a scribe [velavlar] to write sacred scrolls and necessary documents; and a ritual slaughterer; and a teacher of young children.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only difference between the judges and the other appointees is that appointing judges is a mitzvah. These appointments were decided by the community itself, as was the case of the appointment of Levi bar Sisi (appears in several places, such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.81.2?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 81:2</a>) and the unnamed Babylonian scholar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shevi%27it.17a.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Shvi'it 17a</a>).</p>\n<p>It was often the case, however, that the local judges were the local rashei yeshiva, who had smicha. The smicha was mainly an appointment to becoming a head of a yeshiva or beit midrash and to teach students, but also gave them the ability to judge various types of court cases (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Albeck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chanoch Albeck</a>, <a href=\"https://www-jstor-org.nli.idm.oclc.org/stable/23547038?refreqid=excelsior%3A747e2fe6c542d29886f804ac483ea8f5&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Smicha and Minnui and Beit Din, pg. 86</a>). As such, the appointment of these judges was naturally different from that of those described previously, as they were appointed by local sages, rather than the general community. As such, Judicial processes that came to their doorstep were more of \"it comes with the territory\" rather than being chosen specifically for that role by the community. An example of this can be seen in another baraita, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.32b.10?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 32b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Sages taught: The verse states: “Justice, justice, shall you follow.” This teaches that one should follow the Sages to the academy where they are found. For example, follow after Rabbi Eliezer to Lod, after Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai to Beror Ḥayil, after Rabbi Yehoshua to Peki’in, after Rabban Gamliel to Yavne, after Rabbi Akiva to Bnei Brak, after Rabbi Matya to Rome [Romi], after Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon to Sikhnei, after Rabbi Yosei to Tzippori, after Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira to Netzivin, after Rabbi Yehoshua to the exile [gola], i.e., Babylonia, after Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi to Beit She’arim, and after the Sages in the time of the Temple to the Chamber of Hewn Stone.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To reach the Great Sanhedrin following this path, explains Shalom Albeck, one began as a sage with smicha from one of the communities and eventually makes his way to the Sanhedrin. According to him, this process of rising in rank is hinted in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifrei_Devarim.346.1?vhe=Sifrei_Devarim,_Hebrew&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim 346</a><sup>2</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"\"And He was a King in Yeshurun\"...When the Nasi places elders in the yeshiva of below, His great name is exalted above, viz. \"And He was a King in Yeshurun\" — When? \"when the heads of the people gathered.\" And there is no \"gathering\" but that of the elders, as it is written (Bamidbar 11:16) \"Gather unto Me seventy men from the elders of Israel.\"\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> It seems there were two ways a member of the Sanhedrin was appointed: a. A scholar was first appointed by the community to serve as a local judge or halachic advisor/posek - from there, he might receive summons to join a higher court (presumably by the members of that court) - eventually he'll reach the level of Sanhedrin, at which point, if the Nasi saw fit, he would be summoned to join the Sanhedrin. b. A scholar would receive smicha, i.e, an appointment by his rabbi and other sages to serve as the head of a local beit midrash - from there he might move on to a greater beit midrash or to a higher court - and from there, eventually, he might receive summons from the Nasi to join the Sanhedrin. In both cases, the final say came from the Nasi, but it seems that appointees could only be deemed suitable for the position if they managed to advance in the ranks beforehand, which wasn't up to the Nasi.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I think he means that the name \"ben Hachoranit\" or \"ben Hachorani\" is a reference to his hometown (Choron, Beit Choron or perhaps even Choran in Syria), and not the name of one of his parents and that he was called so because he eventually came to Yerushalayim to be a member of one of the higher courts (for example, Rabbi Elazar ben Tzaddok mentions something he learned from Rabbi Yochanan ben Hachorani in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Sukkah.2.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Sukkah 2:4</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=2755\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">we know</a> Rabbi Elazar ben Tzaddok had many teachings about the customs of the people of Yerushalayim). And if such titles are meant to demonstrate the fact that these sages were sent as representatives of their hometowns to the higher courts, then perhaps also Rabbi Elazar Ha'Moda'i can be added.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> This is based on the Sifrei edition <a href=\"https://www.schocken-jts.org.il/hebrew/bookstore/prodView.asp?idproduct=288\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">published</a> by Louis Finkelstein, which is not the version that appears in Sefaria, hence my own edits based on the Hebrew quote brought by Albeck. In the edition, on this passage, Finkelstein notes that this version of the midrash comes from Midrash Hagadol, in Yalkut Amos 548.</p>\n\n\n",

However, although he doesn't explicitly claim it as his invention, Heidenheim does devote two full pages to explaining his system and the need for it in the introduction to his siddur שפה ברורה (see pages 9 and 10 <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH990025049110205171/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Yosef Ofer (in an article in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/i24330026\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leshonenu vol 64</a>, pp. 297–313) credits this to Seligman Baer in his siddur עבודת ישראל (see the bottom of p. 299). I'm not sure what to make of Baer postdating Heidenheim; perhaps Ofer meant that it was popularised by Baer.<sup>*</sup></p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>* He also writes (footnote 8) of a 14th-century Italian mishna manuscript that marks the accent with a <em>meteg</em> mostly for non-ultimately-accented words, ie. the system in question.

    "content": "# In Tanuro Shel Akhnai, from where did R' Eliezer learn that miracles prove Halachic opinions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the famous argument between R'Yehoshua and R'Eliezer (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.59b.1?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Steinsaltz&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanuro Shel Achnai, B\"M 59b</a>), the latter chose to prove his approach by appealing to miracles:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabbi Eliezer answered all possible answers, but the Rabbis did not accept his explanations... R'Eliezer said to them: If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, this carob tree will prove it. The carob tree was uprooted from its place one hundred cubits, and some say four hundred cubits.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where did R'Eliezer learn that miracles prove Halachic opinions? Are there previous examples where this approach has ever worked?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is, probably, Halochoh Le'Moshe, but not from Sinai, a bit earlier. When God sends Moses to lead the Hebrews out of Egypt (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.3.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus.3.10 and on</a>), He starts with reasoning, but when Moses continues to refuse, He teaches some handy tricks Moses can use to convince the people that he's the one. This pattern perfectly mimics the dynamics of R' Eliezer's argument with the Sages:</p>\n<p>At first, He reasons:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Come, therefore, I will send you to Pharaoh, and you shall free My people, the Israelites, from Egypt. But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and free the Israelites from Egypt?” And He said, “I will be with you; that shall be your sign that it was I who sent you. And when you have freed the people from Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain. Moses said to God, “When I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say to them?” And God said to Moses, “Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh.” He continued, “Thus shall you say to the Israelites, ‘Ehyeh sent me to you.’... They will listen to you;”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Moses foresees the reaction of his people and the fact that reasoning alone will not do the job and continues to demand further assurances:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But Moses spoke up and said, “<strong>What if they do not believe me and do not listen to me</strong>, but say: The LORD did not appear to you?” The LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he replied, “A rod.” He said, “Cast it on the ground.” He cast it on the ground and it became a snake, and Moses recoiled from it. Then the LORD said to Moses, “Put out your hand and grasp it by the tail”—he put out his hand and seized it, and it became a rod in his hand— “that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did appear to you.” The LORD said to him further, “Put your hand into your bosom.” He put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, his hand was encrusted with snowy scales! And He said, “Put your hand back into your bosom.”—He put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out of his bosom, there it was again like the rest of his body.— <strong>“And if they do not believe you or pay heed to the first sign, they will believe the second</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the very first encounter with God has taught Moses that witchcraft does work in proving God's points. He kept using it many times after the receiving of the Torah also, for example, in Korakh's case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And Moses said, “<strong>By this, you shall know that it was the LORD who sent me</strong> to do all these things; that they are not of my own devising: if these men die as all men do, if their lot be the common fate of all mankind, it was not the LORD who sent me. But if the LORD brings about something unheard-of, so that the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, you shall know that these men have spurned the LORD.” <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.16.28-30?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers.16.28</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, God's miracles prove Moses' righteousness.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about the underlying mechanisms, and it might be based on the Biblical idea of a Prophet's truthfulness - the only way of telling a true prophet from a false one is to see his prophecies fulfill and especially most improbable ones and that shows that Hashem is with this person (later known as Ruah Hakodesh). So if a prophet says: \"this tree will now move 400 cubits\" and it moves, that proves his truthfulness.</p>\n<p>Early Tannoyim traditionally relied on this prophetic tradition of appealing to miracles as proofs of their Ruach Hakodesh and therefore truthfulness, for example, the verse \"כי מציון תצא תורה\" was interpreted that the Halachah should come forth from the place of constant divine miracles (the Temple, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.5.4?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot.5.4</a> ). But R' Yehoshua promoted a more pragmatic idea, following the destruction of the Temple, of detaching from mysticism and divine guidance that accompanied the Jewish people for the last 1500 years (since Matan Torah) and sticking with human authorities (Nassi, majority of a gathering, etc).</p>\n<p>Even nowadays, <em>some</em> prominent Sefardic AND Ashkenazi Rabbis are highly esteemed (especially in the eyes of low socioeconomic groups) for alleged miracles they perform, and their Halachic authority is maintained by the surrounding mysticism.</p>\n\n\n",

He should confess his sin verbally in contrast to his [evil] speech, and he should burn the inwards and the kidneys [of the offering] in fire because they are the instruments of thought and desire in the human being. He should burn the legs [of the offering] since they correspond to the hands and feet of a person, which do all his work. He should sprinkle the blood upon the altar, which is analogous to the blood in his body. All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his G-d with his body and his soul, and that “his” blood should really be spilled and “his” body burned, were it not for the loving-kindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Yirmiyahu 45).<br />\nRabbi Reissman wondered how it is then that Baruch's contemporary, Yechezkel, was able to prophecy.</p>\n<p>To answer this he quoted a Pri Tzadik on Succos (he didn't give an exact source) who wasn't coming to answer this particular question, but whose words answer it nonetheless.\nReb Tzadok says about Yechezkel's nevuah that all of klal Yisroel went into galus crying, but Yechezkel went with great happiness.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Reissman explained this to mean that Yechezkel had the trait of positivity. Where everyone else was crying about the destruction, Yechezkel saw the opportunity for a fresh start once the nation would be cleansed from their sins of idolatry.\nThat is the happiness Chazzal were referring to when discussing prophecy. Positivity, and the silver lining.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>thanks for the great question. There are so many avenues with which to tackle it, but I think your main kasha is <strong>how can happiness coexist with sadness, or anger etc?</strong></p>\n<p>Chassidut<sup>1,2</sup> has an answer to this, and it does so by rigorously defining <em>Simcha</em>. Next to the three <em>chayot</em> emotions (<em>Chesed</em>, <em>Gevura</em> and <em>Tiferet</em>), there are three <em>dispositions</em>. They are <em>Simcha</em> (happiness), <em>Atzivut</em> (sadness) and <em>Merrirut</em> (bitterness).</p>\n<p><strong>Simcha</strong> is defined <em>not</em> as simply positive mood (that's chesed). It's defined as the state in which one's heart is open and receptive, and they are <em>able to feel emotion</em>, including negative emotions like anger, and mourning.</p>\n<p><strong>Atzivut</strong> isn't defined as negative mood. It's defined as the state in which one is <em>unable to feel emotion, positive or negative</em>. It is more akin to depression really, and has nothing about it that serves holiness and one must strive to get out of it. <strong>Having a closed heart will prevent even <em>ruach hakodesh</em> (which is lower than prophecy)</strong><sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>This fact that <em>Atzivut</em> is not holy, and is forbidden, is pretty much all the proof we need that it would prevent prophecy. Prophecy is something that one achieves through holiness and high levels of spiritual development.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>This line of thinking also explains how Yirmiyahu was crying during prophecy, and deals with what I've extracted as your main kasha: <strong>Due to his state of <em>simcha</em>, he was able to feel - strongly enough to cry - the negative emotions associated with the dark prophecy he was receiving.</strong> Had he been in a state of <em>atzivut</em>, he wouldn't have felt anything at all.</p>\n<p>So yes, it seems that prophecy would require having and open and receptive heart. <em>Atzivut</em> is the antithesis to this, as we know that Yaacov lost his prophecy the entire time he thought Yosef was dead.

Ashkenazi Jews from Europe have a custom to not eat \"kitniyot,\" which is commonly translated as legumes. And as part of this custom they have decided that mustard is a legume. Therefore it's not actually prohibited, but Kashrut agencies do their best to adhere to the very large Ashkenazi custom of prohibiting kitniyot and so they will often list mustard and other kitniyot products as forbidden.</p>\n<p>Jews of Sephardic, Ethiopian, Yemenite, and other Jewish heritages from the middle east all eat mustard on Passover, along with most other types of Kitniyot. So it's important to distinguish what is actually forbidden from \"a custom of refraining,\" because otherwise someone might see a Sephardic Jew eating mustard and think the Sephardic Jew is sinning by eating a prohibited food.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kashrut Status of Certain Oral Tobacco Products During Pesach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em><strong>NOTE: I plan to pose this question to a qualified Rav. But first I am trying to think through the relevant issues to get a sense of how one might pasken this.</strong></em></p>\n<p>My question is regarding whether snus would be acceptable for use on Pesach without certification.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Snus:</strong>  Snus refers to a small pouch of tobacco that one puts between their gums and lip. A tin of snus contains 15-20 of these small pouches. The snus in question is produced in Sweden and the ingredients are regulated there as a food product. The standard <a href=\"https://www.swedishmatch.com/Our-business/smokefree/Ingredients-in-snus/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ingredients</a> are: tobacco, water, salt, propylene glycol,    sodium carbonate, and \"<strong>flavoring</strong>\". By weight, the flavoring represents a minute portion of the total ingredients.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Despite the flavoring, only a long-term user would actually say that a snus \"tastes good\". Likewise, a tin of snus does not smell good, despite the flavoring - it gives off a musty tobacco smell. When someone used snus, they want the tobacco, the flavoring is just window dressing that makes the taste palatable or more interesting. Notably, \"juice\" from a snus pouch sometimes drips out during use and enters the user's mouth. This is typically swallowed because it is a very small amount, but this is done only for convenience sake, because the \"juice\" tastes quite bad. A snus pouch is typically discarded when this begins to occur.</p>\n<p>The closest I can find to my question being addressed is via the CRC's position on chewing tobacco during Pesach. They hold that chewing tobacco \"contains flavors and other sensitive\ningredients\" and thus requires certification. I believe the OU's position on chewing tobacco during Pesach is essentially \"no comment\". Chewing tobacco and snus are not materially that different. One important difference would be that chewing tobacco is produced in the US, and almost anything goes in terms of what ingredients/flavors get put in. In Sweden snus is regulated as a food product and its ingredients are much more limited and \"pure\".</p>\n<p>Relevant to my question is that for the user, abstaining from snus during Pesach would be detrimental to his Oneg Yom Tov and Shabbos. As such, the goal is not to be machmir if there is sufficient room to be meikil.</p>\n<p><em>I am also curious about this question vis-a-vis the nicotine pouch product <a href=\"https://us.zyn.com/questions/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zyn</a>. This is essentially the same as snus except nicotine salt is used rather than actual tobacco.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>FWIW I contacted On! And they said it was totally gluten-free. However I researched more and legally it can be considered gluten-free if there is a miniscule amount.</p>\n<p>I asked my Rav and he wouldn't allow it. If anyone has gotten a hetter since this was posted or has more info please post.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>What did the rabbi say? I found a kolel's website in Lakewood where the rabbis say Nicorette, Equate gum, and Snus are kosher. I really want to know about non-tobacco nicotine pouches like Velo, On!, or Zyn. I've asked a few rabbis but they have never heard of these types of product and won't say without knowing what the \"flavors\" in the ingredients lists are.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the connection between שחר (morning/light) and שחור (black)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How do we understand the connection between שחר (morning/light) and שחור (black) which seem to be opposites of the spectrum? (The definition should also be able to fit into 'shaver' as Rashi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beitzah.35b.11?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Beitzah.35b.11.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beitza (35b)</a> writes השחור - תער על שם שמשחיר את השער אלמא לשון השפלה הוא)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The earliest uses of שחר as \"morning\" (which is perhaps better known as בוקר) seem to be in the form of עלות השחר, the שחר has ascended. See Bereishis 19:15, 32:27. So, maybe עלות השחר means the darkness has ascended and been replaced by light.</p>\n<p>Another possibility would be that morning is called שחר because it is like a young man with dark hair (see mishna avos 3:12)?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Leshacher</em> is \"to discern\"; you can start making out pictures and forms at dawn; and black ink is easily read.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/321723?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">created</a> a list containing most of the times Shachar, Shachor, and Shichor come up in Tanach with the respective mefarshim who explain the connection to the shoresh ש.ח.ר.</p>\n<p>This is a post from the Hebrew etymology extraordinaire <a href=\"https://www.balashon.com/search?q=shachar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Balashon</a>:</p>\n<p>\"Is shachor (shahor) שחור - \"black\" related to shachar (shahar) שחר - \"dawn\"? The best way to tell would be to see if there are common or divergent etymologies.</p>\n<p>Klein, who tends to be more conservative in these questions, shows different derivations. Shachor, he writes, is related to Syrian שוחרא shuchra and Akkadian shuru, meaning \"coal\". On the other hand, shachar is related to Moabite שחרת, JAram שחרא, Arabic sahar, Akkadian sheru and shirtu - all meaning \"dawn\".</p>\n<p>Steinberg also provides different etymologies. He writes that shachar is related to צחר, צהר and זהר - all meaning \"to shine\", whereas shachor is the Shaph'el form of חרה - \"to burn\". For an example, he writes that the Targum for Iyov 30:30 offers שחם for שחר - also Shaph'el of חם, \"to be warm\".</p>\n<p>However, there are those that disagree, and find a connection. Almagor-Ramon writes that there is a phenomenon in Hebrew and other languages, where when there is a root that has words which approach the limit of that meaning, from that limit they have a tendency to switch meanings. For an example, she writes that at night, everything is black (shachor), and toward the end of the night, on the limit, when there is already more light than black, we still refer to that period as shachar - dawn. This concept is used in word games called \"synonym chains\" as described here.</p>\n<p>This site quotes a couple of Rabbinic sources:</p>\n<p>Immediately before the rise of the morning star, the night is at its darkest...(Midrash Shocher Tov)\nShachar---\"morning\" or \"dawn\"---is related to shachor---\"black\"---because the moment immediately preceding the dawn is the blackest, darkest part of the night. (Vilna Gaon, Avnei Eliyahu)</p>\n<p>It even goes so far as to suggest that the expression \"It is always darkest before the dawn\" has its origins in the connection between shachar and shachor. Curiously, even Klein gives three definitions to shachar: 1) dawn, 2) daybreak 3) the blackness preceding the dawn (emphasis mine).</p>\n<p>One verb that everyone connects is שחר - \"to seek, to search\". Klein writes:</p>\n<p>Probably derived from שחר ( = dawn), whence arose the meaning 'to rise early in the morning; to go out early in the morning and seek', whence 'to turn toward'.</p>\n<p>Jastrow offers \"to break through, dig, to search, seek\" - and from here to the break of dawn.</p>\n<p>Other derivatives of shachar are shacharit שחרית (the time of, and the name of the morning prayer) and shocher שוחר - a fan, a friend, as in שוחר שלום - \"a lover of peace\".</p>\n<p>Shachar can also mean \"meaning, sense, significance\". This derives from Yeshayahu 8:20 - אֲשֶׁר אֵין-לוֹ שָׁחַר - which literally meant \"with no dawn\", for no light will be shone upon it. Today the expression often refers to rumors \"that have no foundation\".</p>\n<p>Whether or not shachar and shachor are connected, there is one word that people derive from one or the other. In Kohelet 11:10, we find the pairing of הַיַּלְדוּת וְהַשַּׁחֲרוּת - childhood and youth (shacharut). Ibn Ezra connects shacharut to dawn, the beginning of a person's life. The Targum indicates that shacharut means youth due to the darkness of hair (יומי דאוכמות שער).</p>\n<p>As we've done with the other colors, we should also ask: does shachor only mean black? Kaddari writes that there are times when shachor means the color black (VaYikra 13:31), and other times where it means \"dark\" (Shir HaShirim 1:5-6).</p>\n<p>In Modern Hebrew slang, shachor can refer to the Haredim, the black market, and members of the Tank Corp in the army.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Given that this is so, it would make sense to attempt to appoint justices to whom we are instinctually disposed towards. When not just their wisdom and understanding appeals to people but the entirety of their persona draws people to heed their decisions.</p>\n<p>Armed with this understanding, we see that it is not that we are placing aesthetics on a pedestal, but rather it is an attempt to speak to and exploit the natural human condition, in order to effectuate the needs of justice.

Thus, the commandment to judge favorably only applies to Jews who are considered \"your fellow.\" Additionally, the commandment is not to judge them favorably, but rather to judge them \"with justice,\" meaning that you must judge them according to their actions, whether they have a history of wickedness or righteousness, etc.</p>\n<p>However, when the Sages in Ethics of the Fathers say, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Judge every man favorably,\"</a> this is only a \"middas chassidus:\" it is recommended, but by no means required, to judge someone whose previous actions are unknown favorably.</p>\n<p>Havig an ayin tova, though, is less about halacha and more about a way of life. In order to see the good in G-d's creations and other people, especially those who you <em>must</em> see the good in, it is recommended to think this way about everyone. The Chafetz Chaim says that, while one is allowed to speak Lashon Hara about a non-Jew, it is not a good idea, because it trains one's mind to think negatively about people in general, which can lead to transgression. In order to be in the habit of thinking positively, one should refrain from judging negatively when it is not necessary.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We need to show respect to all people.

    "content": "# Why are trace amounts of chametz in milk or eggs bittul before Pesach, but not in spices or quinoa?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(Note:  It's entirely possible that one or more of the premises of this question is incorrect; if that's the case, I would very much appreciate any clarification of what the actual underlying halacha is.)</p>\n<p>My understanding is that it is permissible to use eggs and (non-chocolate) milk on Passover, even without a KLP certification, provided they were purchased before the holiday, and that the reason for this permission is that any trace amounts of chametz that might be present become <em>bittul</em> before the <em>chag</em> begins.  (Incidentally, I have also heard the same argument given with respect to olive oil, orange juice, and sugar, but there seems to be less consistency in this regard.)</p>\n<p>But I have also been told that when purchasing quinoa, it is essential to make sure that it is sourced from a producer who ensures that the quinoa does not come into contact with other grains at any point in the harvesting or packaging process, and therefore quinoa can <strong>only</strong> be used if it is purchased with a KLP hechsher.  The same, I am told, applies to ground spices.</p>\n<p>Why doesn't the same principle that permits us to use eggs or milk without a KLP (provided it was purchased before Pesach) also apply to quinoa and spices — or, for that matter, tomato paste, apple juice, amaranth, or other non-kitniyot, \"single-ingredient\" products?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Plain milk contains added vitamins which pose a <em>slight</em> risk of chametz. Therefore, it is recommended to buy milk certified for passover, or if this is <em>not possible</em>, you can buy it before Pesach so the chametz will be battul.<br />\nEggs and olive oil do not need to be certified for passover, and can even be bought on Pesach.</p>\n<p>Quinoa, on the other hand, has a much higher risk of being contaminated. It is often grown with barley and stored in sacks that contained flour, see <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/seasonal/pesach/1864/kosher-for-passover-quinoa/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Star-K's website</a> for details.</p>\n<p>Spices have an entirely different problem, where they might actually be adulterated with chametz or kitnios (think corn starch to prevent caking), which may be omitted from the ingredients list legally or illegally, and therefore must be certified for Passover. Additionally, some spices are grown near grain and might contain actual grains before it is ground.</p>\n<p>A similar problem arises with sugar, where powdered sugar, which contains starch that may be chametz or kitniyos, can be re-worked into plain sugar, and should therefore be certified for Pesach, see this <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/662/raising-cane-the-kashrus-and-other-halachic-issues-of-cane-sugar/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article from the Star-K</a>. The <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/articles/ou-p-not-ou-p-products-require-passover-certification/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU</a> disagrees, and says that plain white cane sugar can be used with no certification (and bought on Pesach).</p>\n<p>Many of the other products you mentioned are not produced on dedicated equipment, and the equipment used to process them is very likely used for chametz or kitniyos as well. For example, tomato paste is cooked and then canned using canning equipment, any of which was likely used for chametz or kitniyos. Unless you know how the food was produced, you can't accurately asses the risk of containing chametz.</p>\n<p>In short, it is recommended to buy kosher-for-passover milk and other similar products because of the risk of containing chametz, but in cases where this is not possible, because of the very low risk, it is permissible to buy the products before Pesach and rely on the fact that the possible chametz will be battul. However, other products are more likely to contain chametz or kitniyos, and in larger proportions, and therefore must be certified.</p>\n<p>For more information, the <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/guidelines/food-items/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU</a> has a list of common products, whether they must be certified, and why, as well as a <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/PG21-Products-OU-CERTIFIED-FOR-YEAR-ROUND-USE.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">list</a> of products that are kosher for passover and may be bought on Pesach even without certification.</p>\n\n\n",

Then they killed the young men, or servants, of Job, by the sword. Only one of these servants got away, and it is he who is telling Job these things.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וָאִמָּלְטָה רַק-אֲנִי לְבַדִּי לְהַגִּיד לָךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, וָאִמָּלְטָה is cohortative. In Joüon & Muraoka's <em>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</em> (2nd Ed.), pg. 127 it says that the cohortative is the \"volitive mood of the first person. It has a direct use (e.g. May I kill!, I wish/want to kill!) and an indirect or subordinated use (with ו), (e.g. in order that I may kill)\".</p>\n<p>The grammar indicates that one discerns the difference b/t the direct/indirect depending on how the prefixed ו is used, which seems somewhat subjective.</p>\n<p>On pg. 346 it says about the indirect volitive, “the volitive nuance is often very weak and does not always need to be translated.\" It goes on to say that it can indicate purpose under certain circumstances. It seems to me, however, that this is not an indirect volitive, from the context.</p>\n<p>It seems quite unclear generally how וָאִמָּלְטָה should be understood and translated.</p>\n<p>\"And they struck the servants by the sword, and I wanted to escape, only I alone, to tell you.\"?</p>\n<p>This doesn't seem right, given that we have a Niphal for the verb. Another alternative is \"...and [they] wanted me to escape, only I alone, to tell you.\" So the idea is that the Sabeans wanted to kill everyone but leave one to relate what happened to Job.</p>\n<p>Both of these seem quite different from standard translations I have seen, which render the verb as a simple past \"I, only I, <em>escaped</em> to tell you.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I don't think that the final ה indicates the cohortative here, but rather it is a paragogic ה- attached to a wayyiqtol form of the root מלט (nif`al).

I've read the rabbinic approval that comes with the lamp, as well as any teshuvot I can find on the topic; but I can't find any specific details as to why halachically the cover is considered a separate piece from the body of the lamp.

This machine can save lives if you put someone in it. However, for some patients, this will not make them live, rather just delay their deaths. Let's say patient A walks in. He is in a very bad situation, he will die within 1 hour if not put in the machine for a 24 hours minimum. If he is put in the machine, he will survive for 1 month. Is it better to put him in the machine and let him live for a month? However, if you do this, you may have to face a situation where patient B, who will die in an hour but will live until his normal life expectancy if put in the machine, will show up. And you have must either take Patient A out of the machine, directly killing him, and put patient B in, saving him. Or you could leave patient A in, let him live for another month, and indirectly kill patient B. What should the CEO do?</p>\n<p>P.S.

You can find the responsa on KolCorona.</p>\n<p>Rabbis Hershel Schachter and Asher Weiss both wrote that you don't take someone off of a ventilator, so long as they're still alive, as that would be an act of murder, even if you could use it to save someone with a much better prognosis. (Now if the patient isn't clearly living ... or if the ventilator needs to be occasionally switched off anyhow ... it gets trickier.) Rabbi Shachter is adamant on this point. Rabbi Weiss assumes this is the case as well. He then notes that R' Zalman Nechemya Goldberg zt\"l (who we sadly lost in the past year) would allow the hospital to take a poor-prognosis person off a ventilator to give it to a better-prognosis patient; Rabbi Weiss simply comments -- <em>this requires deeper analysis</em> (pilpul).</p>\n<p><em>If</em>, however, nobody is yet hooked up to a ventilator; it's the middle of a pandemic, and every day for the past two weeks you've maxed out your daily ventilators; it's 7am, you have one free ventilator, and a frail patient already in renal failure comes in -- Rabbi Weiss and Schachter agree that you may triage based on the supposed healthy-other-than-this-virus patient you strongly expect will show up within a few hours. Pandemic circumstances allow one to imagine all the people likely to show up at the ER today, and then triage accordingly. (Rabbi Weiss proves from a thought experiment -- say at 7am a poor-prognosis patient is brought in, and just then you get a call from an ambulance that a good-prognosis-if-ventilated patient should arrive in 15 minutes.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a concept that you don't skip over a mitzva that is in front of you.

That's why we do what's in front of us now and save patient A.</p>\n<p>If patient B shows up you CAN NOT remove patient A from the machine it is murder.</p>\n<p>In Judaism, we value every minute of life if we can extend life even for a minute we do what e can to so that will happen.

But let's assume, for the sake of this question, that we follow the Shulchan Aruch, R' Moshe Feinstein, and R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach -- that you are defined by your \"home\" vis-a-vis how many days to keep.)</p>\n<p>When we switched to a fixed calendar (let's assume around the year 500) and the Talmud ordered diaspora Jews to continue keeping two days, some of the parameters may have thus changed in that decree, compared to what people had been doing previously. It appears the decree was: \"Diaspora Jews keep two days.\" Some have suggested this was a way of gently pushing folks to move to Israel, or that Jews outside of Israel needed more of a spiritual lift. We already had treatments of \"local practices\", for which you are defined by your home; so how-many-days-should-I-keep fell into this category as well.</p>\n<p>(Just to make it even more fun: when they relied on messengers, who kept two days? People who lived beyond the range of the messengers. Rambam says this is estimated by the minimalist borders in Gittin Ch. 1, and therefore those are the places that keep one day of yomtov. Ritva, if I'm not mistaken, says that when the enactment changed from \"keep two days if you didn't get a messenger\" to \"keep two days outside of Israel\", they used the maximalist definition of \"Israel\", i.e. the borders found at the end of Bamidbar. Even though that didn't align perfectly with what the practice had been in the messenger era.)</p>\n\n\n",

I do not agree with Rabbi Akiva’s belief. I agree with Rabbi Ishmael that “the Torah (which is intended for humans) speaks in human language.” It is also possible that Chronicles tried to show the biblical characters in a more favorable light, as opposed to the Bible admittance of their flaws. the patriarchs were human. This might explain why Chronicles attributes a greater number to David, 7,000, as opposed to Samuel's 1,000 captured horses. Such a high number extols David.</p>\n<p>One more possibility and, this was pointed out to me by one of the commentators, Torahlover613, that according to Redak, Samuel only counted the officers while Chronicles includes everyone. Redak explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>David captured 1,000 chariots and 7,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot\nsoldiers of his force; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses\nexcept for 100, which he retained.[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[1] See Radak on Chronicles 18:4:1</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Meaning of the word \"Devash\"",
    "content": "# Meaning of the word \"Devash\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sometimes, when Devash is mentioned in scriptural passages, Rashi observes that the Hebrew word is general and included many sweet fluids.</p>\n<p>For example, Leviticus 2:11 commands “For you shall not cause to go up in smoke any leavening or any Devash”; Rashi remarks that any sweet fruit extract is called Devash. At Deuteronomy 26:02, Rashi discusses Deuteronomy 8:8 and the identity of Devash as date honey.</p>\n<p>At these places, I have always thought that Rashi was trying to correct the assumption that bees’ honey was intended; Rashi meant that not only bees’ honey was included, but a broader class of sweet fluids. But I wonder: maybe bees’ honey really has nothing to do with it at all, and Rashi thought some other example would come to the reader’s mind, like molasses made from sugar cane; and he was broadening from that narrow case. I’m trying to figure out what suggested bees and whether that association is correct.</p>\n<p>In the first place, of course, the use of the word English “honey” suggests bees. And perhaps the translators choose the word “honey” because of Judges 14, which seems to be the one clear scriptural association of Devash to bees. Translation of some other passages use the word “honeycomb,” as Psalm 19:11 and Proverbs 27:7; but the latter refers to trampling a “honeycomb”, and since it would be unlikely that anyone would trample a beehive, perhaps that translation should be questioned.</p>\n<p>I suppose that the flow of thought in the Deuteronomy citations, and the emphasis on products of the land, seemed motivated by the idea that bees’ honey is not a product of the land because bees are flying animals. But maybe Rashi meant that sugar cane could not be the intended Devash, because the land of Israel is praised for dates but not for sugar cane.</p>\n<p>At 1 Samuel 14:25 to 27 and Song of Songs 5:1, Rashi seems clearly to understand that bees don’t enter into it, although English translations there might use the word “honey.” Similarly, in Deuteronomy 32:13, there seems to be no thought of bees.</p>\n<p>So perhaps the correct translation of Devash is “syrup” or \"molasses\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We find in the Mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makhshirin.6.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makhshirin Perk 6 Mishna 4</a> that דבש means honey of bees specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שִׁבְעָה מַשְׁקִין הֵן. הַטַּל וְהַמַּיִם, הַיַּיִן וְהַשֶּׁמֶן, וְהַדָּם, וְהֶחָלָב, וּדְבַשׁ דְּבוֹרִים. דְּבַשׁ צְרָעִים, טָהוֹר, וּמֻתָּר בַּאֲכִילָה:<br />\nThere are seven liquids: dew, water, wine, oil, blood, milk and bees’ honey. Hornets’ honey does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness and may be eaten</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it is reasonable that Rashi in Chumash has to explain that in Tanach, דבש is used to mean all sweet foods generally as opposed to bees' honey.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As a general rule, unless specified otherwise, d'vash will mean fruit honey,\nparticularly date honey (see shiva'as haminim where d'vash is reffering to dates),\nand also fig honey (a few examples are found in the gemara with stories relating\nto figs' honey).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think you might technically be correct that דבש just means a sweet sticky substance; honey, molasses, and syrup should all be equally applicable.</p>\n<p>Rashi in Leviticus 2:11 clearly says that the term דבש refers to any sweetness from fruit. It's even clearer from his commentary on 2:12, where he says that you bring from the דבש the first fruits, such as the first figs and dates. This fits with his explanation of Exodus 13:5 ארץ זבת חלב ודבש refers to fig and date honey.</p>\n<p>As you pointed out, in 1 Samuel 14:25-27 Rashi explicitly says that יערות דבש refers to sugar cane. He even quotes \"R' Nathan the Ishmaelite\" that in arabic that kind of דבש is called 'sukra.' This approach is also taken by Mahari Kara and the Metzudos.</p>\n<p>(In contrast, the Radak, Rabbeinu Yeshaya and Ralbag (loc. cit) all assume the reference is to bee's honey.)</p>\n<p>We see that Rashi assumes דבש can refer to sugar cane sap, date honey or fig honey (as the OP cited). I don't know of an explicit source in Tanach where Rashi explains דבש to mean bee honey. Perhaps he learns that when the mishna and gemara refer to דבש דבורים it's a borrowed term.</p>\n<p>(If he understood that דבש in Tanach can refer to bee's honey, it's difficult to explain why he needed to explain that Shmuel 14 was talking about sugar cane- which is exactly what the Radak asks on Rashi. It's much simpler to assume that the verse is talking about honey from a beehive, a common occurrence, instead of assuming that sugar cane grows in israel and needing to bring a proof from the arabic.\nBut if דבש always means a fruit sweetness in Tanach, it would explain why he couldn't simply explain it as bee honey.)</p>\n\n\n",

I'd focus on areas of practice: prayer, non-prayer tasks, theological questions, and the practice of engaging the Torah.</p>\n<p>tl;dr - Christian Avodah Zarah is unique in it's claiming to be inheritor of Judaism, but rejects MOST of what Islam does still adhere to: Idolatry, Diet/Cleanliness/Practices, Theologically unique in understanding human sin, and finally, unique in approach to Torah.</p>\n<p>the too long:</p>\n<p>Christian prayer practice by and large is obvious idolatry. A figure or memory of a man/god is worshiped. That's pretty serious Avodah Zarah.  Is it unique too Christianity?  No.</p>\n<p>Non-prayer tasks, such as diet, cleanliness, charity, etc are very different from Judaism.  Most importantly, they consider their religion to be a nullification, or some strange sense of \"completion\" of the very laws we live by.  I'd say that makes doing christian non-prayer practices very uniquely non-Jewish, as they're seen as the precise nullification of them. The willful nullifying and overcoming or superceding of Jewish normative life is the uniqueness to me.  What KIND of Avodah Zarah would it be?  It was be a conscious rejection, with no appeal to ignorance.  It would be a kind of Avodah Zarah directly purposed to be destructive of Jewish life.  How many other types of Avodah Zarah are so consciously and arrogantly violent to Jewish law and normative practices?  Sharia? I don't know.</p>\n<p>Theologically, what Christians believe - that there is a unique incarnation of the divine spirit that existed in order to setup and resolve an \"original sin\" and that human sin can ONLY be absolved through this incarnation of the divine spirit.  This flies in the face of all Jewish thought - we know that the soul is pure, the soul is good, and that humanity has teshuvah available always to clear away the problems and reveal the inherent and ineluctable goodness of the soul.  In this way, by the foundational concept that the human soul is somehow impure, this type of Avodah Zarah is directly in conflict with Jewish ideas.  It creates a psychological state of being that is exclusionary and rejects other traditions.  In this way, the Avodah of HaShem, seeing and living universal consciousness bounded at the very least by the seven laws of Noah, is made impossible.  Know this, as christians who know Judaism must, they are again arrogantly trying to replace fundamental Jewish theological ideas.  It's the Avodah of Negation, perhaps, to coin a phrase.</p>\n<p>Finally, wrt engaging Torah.  Christians do not read the Torah according to our tradition.  They read the Torah from a completely different point of view, without any reference to pre or post exhilic Jewish commentators, traditions, etc.  They do not involve themselves in Mishnah, Gamara, or any of the ways we practice understanding Torah.  As reading Torah is a normative Jewish spiritual act, an Avodat HaShem, they are espeically reading it in a way the cancels the Jewish tradition.  Since they claim to be inheritors and supplantors of the tradition, I'd also call it a willful Avodah Zarah.  This time I'd call it one of perversion of the mean, spirit, and text of the Torah, in order to teach falsehoods about the Torah.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap-up, this Avodah Zarah is special, as it claims to be the supplantor of the Jewish tradition, it is often quite obviously idolatry despite their protestations, it casts out just about all the practical acts, warps the theological teachings to create a pitiful humanity imprisoned in sin, and willfully rereads the Torah to suit their theology, casting off the tradition from which the Torah came into the world and teaching from the \"same\" book the destruction of the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>So, it's unique Avodah Zarah, indeed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think we can set Christianity aside from all other forms of Avodah Zara, is that Christianity, as you write, accepts the Old Testament (ie all five books of the Torah and the Tanakh) where Islam claims these are a corruption of the word of G-d and recreates them in the Qur'an. Also, it could be argued that the Christian Father is the same HaShem of Judaism, save Jesus while Islam's Allah is a moon god of sorts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You may be interested in Franz Rosenzweig’s reconceptualization of the Jewish-Christian relationship, in which he saw Christianity as Judaism’s pre-eminent ‘junior partner’ in the redemption of the world, indeed, the ‘rays of light’ in relation to the ‘fire’ of Judaism. He may not have been speaking Hashem’s word, but he seems to me to have grasped something important about Christianity’s ‘special status’ and pre-eminence over all other rival religions and philosophies. His philosophical analysis is complex, and not for the faint-hearted, but I for one have found his work very rewarding to study. Rosenzweig was first and foremost a great philosopher of History, which might make him helpful with regard to your reference to Christian ‘success’. I wish you success in your enquiries into this great subject :)</p>\n\n\n",

And behold through this,\nit may repair at a different time what it corrupted in a [previous]\ntime; or perfect what it did not perfect. However at the end of all\nthe incarnations in the judgement in the future to come, the trial\nwill surely be regarding [the soul], according to all of the\nincarnations that it experienced and all the states in which it\nexisted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are here to repair ourselves and our world using all the resources, talent, etc. at our disposal. If we don't succeed at first, we might return to this world to try fixing ourselves and our world again under different circumstances. Then we might return yet again after another failed attempt. During Krias Shema Al Hamita, we are forgiving anyone who has harmed us in any way, whether in this lifetime or a previous one. Why? When another is punished on our account, we too suffer some of the consequences. Chazal say one cannot be mekabel pnei haShechina while others are punished on their account. We don't wish that on ourselves, and we don't wish that damage on the world - whether in our current lifetime or previous ones, because they are all intertwined.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Mishna Berura (239:9) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.239.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">adds</a> that forgiving those who harmed you will grant you a long life -  גם ראוי למחול לכל מי שחטא כנגדו וציערו ובזכות זה האדם מאריך ימים. Following the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.28a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah (28a)</a> listing why each individual merited a long life:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלֹא עָלְתָה עַל מִטָּתִי קִלְלַת חֲבֵרִי כִּי הָא דְּמַר זוּטְרָא\nכִּי הֲוָה סָלֵיק לְפוּרְיֵיהּ אֲמַר שְׁרֵי לֵיהּ לְכׇל מַאן\nדְּצַעֲרָן Rabbi Neḥunya also said: Nor did I ever allow the\nresentment caused by my fellow’s curse to go up with me upon my bed.\nThis is referring to conduct such as that of Mar Zutra. When he would\ngo to bed at night, he would first say: I forgive anyone who has vexed\nme.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that premise in mind, we aspire to forgive others from previous gilgulim each night because some of the tests we faced today may very well have been a rerun of a failed test in a previous lifetime. For instance, if Reuven sideswiped your wagon in the 1800s but didn't pay, and you didn't forgive him since the damage was never renumerated, then if he's granted the opportunity to fix what he broke once again, you and Reuven will come back in the 2000s and he might sideswipe your car. Maybe he'll fail the test once more and decide to hit-and-run. It's now up to you to forgive this person. You certainly don't have to, but you might come back again in the 2050s and he'll sideswipe your hover car all over again. Since we never know which of today's tests are \"new episodes\" or \"reruns\" from a previous lifetime, it's wise to forgive everyone who harmed us each day. Helpful for them to finally be let off, but most helpful for us not to need to return all over again.</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, in Moses's books, there is an almost forty year gap in the book of Numbers without much notice at all (probably early on in Parshas Chukas near the section on Miriam's death) - then the entire book of Deuteronomy was given and written in about 37 days, from the first of Shevat till the seventh of Adar.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, vegetarianism is better for Jewish observances. One does not need to wait six hours after consuming meat for dairy. Only one pair of dishes is required, save for Pesach. One also saves money on kosher meat, which, if you avoid all meat products altogether, you can’t transgress at least twenty mitzvot!</p>\n<p>For all the above reasons I think vegetarianism is superior. It also keeps the complexion of the face intact.</p>\n<p>Second, the Bible prefers vegetarians (Genesis 2:16). Adam and Eve are only permitted to eat plant food. This changes when humans become cruel and eat meat, resulting in the flood. After the flood, Noah is told that he may consume “Every moving creature that lives will be yours to eat” (Genesis 9:3), with the exception of a live animal (Genesis 9:4; also see Rashi on Genesis 9:3). Noah was \"allowed\" to eat meat as a concession to human nature. Similarly, Rambam writes that G-d does not want or need sacrifices but \"allowed\" them as a concession for human needs. Rav Kook wrote that the sacrifices will not continue in the messianic age and that Jews will no longer be carnivores but enjoy plant food.</p>\n<p>Since the ideal state for the world is a state when the world will return to the state of the Garden of Edan, an ideal world will sacrifice and meat-eating is barred, it is safe to assume that the Kohen will also be a vegan.</p>\n\n\n",

This last halacha is not common by us, since we are not accustomed to withdraw our hands from the bread until Birchas HaMazon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is this considered a case that never happens (other that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/121054/19563\">Erev Pesach</a>)? At wedding meals, for example, they usually serve bread at the beginning of the meal, and for the second course there is no bread to be found. Or one who doesn't have a lot of challa, when the bread is finished he continues his meal. And dessert often is served after the table is cleared. Is this just a change in the practice from hundreds of years ago, and we really should apply this halacha, or is there some reason why it doesn't apply to theses cases.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Many Rabbis say it is indeed a problem at weddings.\nRav S.Z. Aurbach and Rabbi Scheinberg who are quoted as saying weddings are not an issue, is because the removal of the bread/tables was not because they are in fact done with the bread, but rather for a different reason, the dancing.\nSee the picture from the Dirshu Mishna Berurah below.\nBut certainly when people are done with the bread because they are done with the bread this law still exists in full.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uLPtm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.177.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biur Halacha</a> on that Shulchan Aruch who discusses the case of large meals where they would clear off the bread from the table and bring out fruit and dessert. He says that this case would depend on one's understanding of which action requires making a new bracha on the food.\nWhile some opinions say that removing the bread is enough, many others refer to removing the actual table.</p>\n<p>And while he seems to lean towards the commentators who only require removing bread, he doesn't conclude that one should actually make a blessing in such a situation. If anything, he quotes the language of the chayei adam that the minhag is to be lenient.\nIt would seem that he would follow the general rule of \"safek brachos le'hakel\" (in case of a doubtful need to make a blessing, don't make it.) He actually rules this way later on in the same biur halacha.</p>\n<p>Thus, in almost all of our meals nowadays, we generally stay sitting at the table and merely clear off the bread. We don't usually remove the actual tables.</p>\n<p>The question comes up regarding weddings, when they do remove the tables after the meal and then, later on during the dancing, bring out desserts. In this case, as mentioned in another answer here, there is a machlokes among contemporary poskim whether to require another brocha or not. (I believe Rav Yisrael Belsky zatza\"l also sided that a new bracha was required, in a teshuva printed in Shulchan Levi. I'll add a source when I can verify this.)</p>\n\n\n",

I think this is limited to Jews, although I may be wrong. It ended with Malachi and the end of prophecy, or alternatively around the second Temple period. (For example, T.B. Chullin 13b suggests that idolatry is not as serious an issue when outside the land of Israel.)

Yes, there is Islam and Christianity, but they are based on Judaism and do not constitute a dangerous threat to Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Jews abandoned idolatry after the return from Babylon.  The Talmud has a colorful explanation: The Jews captured the idolatry demon and destroyed it.  They were about to do the same for the sexual immorality demon, but didn't because sex is needed for procreation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[After the return from Babylonian captivity, the Men of the Great Assembly said:] Woe, woe!  It is [the evil desire for idolatry] who has destroyed the Sanctuary, burned the Temple, killed all the righteous, driven all Israel into exile, and is still dancing around among us! You [God] have surely given him to us so that we may receive reward [by resisting him.] We do not want either him or reward through him!... [So the evil desire for idolatry] was surrendered to them.  He came forth from the Holy of Holies like a young fiery lion... They said: How shall we act? Perhaps, God forbid, Heaven may have mercy upon him!... The prophet said to them: Cast him into a pot made of lead and close its opening with lead, because lead absorbs the voice...  [They did so and he died.]\nThey said... Let us [also] pray for mercy for the Evil Inclination.  They prayed for mercy, and he was handed over to them. [The prophet] said to them: Realize that if you kill him [also], the world goes down. They imprisoned him for three days [to see what would happen], then looked in the whole land of Israel for a fresh egg and could not find it. [The Evil Inclination is responsible for sex, which is required for reproduction.] They said: What shall we do now? Shall we kill him? The world would then go down. Shall we beg for half-mercy [allow him to live, but not to tempt us]? They do not grant half-measures in heaven. They put out his eyes and let him go. It helped inasmuch as he no longer entices men to commit incest. [Yoma 69b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Hunia said in the name of Rabbi Dosa bar Tebeth: God created two evil inclinations in His world, the inclination to idolatry and the inclination to [sexual immorality].  The inclination to idolatry has already been uprooted [from the Jewish people]. The inclination to [sexual immorality, however,] still exists... [Song of Songs Rabbah 7:14]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After Babylon, the Jews did not just ignore idolatry, they were willing to die rather than be forced to worship idols! (Maccabean revolt, etc.)  So no, idolatry is no longer a problem for Jews.</p>\n\n\n",

The ruling of the ruling of Shulchan Aruch (OC 60:4), at least by a biblical commandment, is that <em>kavanah lotzeis</em> - the intent to fulfil the obligation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש אומרים שאין מצות צריכות כוונה, ויש אומרים שצריכות כוונה לצאת בעשיית\nאותה מצוה, וכן הלכה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With regards to <em>kriyas shema</em> specifically, the Shulchan Aruch writes (60:5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הקורא את שמע ולא כיון לבו בפסוק ראשון שהוא שמע ישראל לא יצא ידי חובתו\nוהשאר אם לא כיון לבו אפילו היה קורא בתורה או מגיה הפרשיות האלו בעונת\nקריאת שמע יצא והוא שכיון לבו בפסוק ראשון:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A casual reading of the Shulchan Aruch may lead to the conclusion that the intent to fulfill the obligation is only crucial in the first verse. However, it is evident in the Rishonim in Berachos that <em>this</em> law is not discussing the <em>intent to fulfill the obligation</em>, but the <em>understanding of the meaning</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A1_%D7%94#%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%9E%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mishne Berura</em></a> brings two conflicting opinions on how to understand the Shulchan Aruch, whether he means to limit to requirement of concentrating on the meaning to the first verse, or the intent to fulfill the obligation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונה זו האמורה כאן איננו הכונה האמורה בסעיף ד' דשם הוא <strong>הכונה לצאת ידי חובת\nמצוה זה בעינן לכל הפרשיות</strong> [כמו שכתב הריטב\"א בר\"ה ושיטה מקובצת בברכות]\nמשא\"כ כונה זו הוא להתבונן ולשום על לבו מה שהוא אומר ולכך הוא לעיכובא\nרק בפסוק ראשון שיש בו עיקר קבלת עול מלכות שמים ואחדותו ית' וי\"א <strong>שאפילו\nכונה לצאת הוא לעיכובא רק בפסוק ראשון</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, if one didn't have intent to fulfil the obligation of Shema, one would not have 'accidentally been <em>mekayem</em> the morning shema' - at least in the the first verse, and according to most opinions, the rest of Shema too.</p>\n<p>Even in situations where intent is not required, most Rishonim agree that if one has specific intent <em>not</em> to discharge his obligaton, he doesn't discharge his obligation.

The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88b.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 88b</a>) relates that when Moshe Rabbeinu went up to Heaven to receive the Torah, the angels protested: they wanted it for themselves. With the help of G-d, Moshe challenged the angels on several points relevant to our case, most notably:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What else is written in it? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12). Moses asked the angels: Do you have a father or a mother that would render the commandment to honor them relevant to you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if an AI was created to somehow procreate, feel jealousy, have arms and feet etc, there would inevitably be some small detail in which their experience differs from the human experience. Bottom line, the Torah was given for Man. Not for angels, not for AI, and probably not for aliens either.</p>\n<p>Not sure what they would do about religion. They would need some sort of religion. Perhaps they could become Noahides, which is universal enough that it's conceivable many extraterrestrial societies would be able to find meaning in it. Or perhaps they would have already had a prophetic experience. Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik is quoted in \"The Rav Thinking Aloud\" to believe in the possibility of an extraterrestrial \"am hanivchar\", which would imply a separate prophecy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The assumption your making is just that - an assumption. Many technologists do not believe that AI can ever truly have a 'soul', as described by John Searle's Chinese room argument. Meaning a simulation of something is never the thing itself - AI inherently cannot be a human being despite it's amazing ability to replicate it. And machine learning exists, at the point it potentially ellipses human intelligence it will have morphed into something non-human. Furthermore the point at which human intelligence and computer intelligence are equal will be extremely short - artificial intelligence will grow at a much more rapid pace than pure human intelligence. In my opinion will will fuse with AI - similar to how our iPhones are a natural extension of our biological selves, therefore we will be the AI - and thus we will be AI Yidden.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Being Jewish involves having a specific type of neshama.

Interesting to think about if they would be chayav if they kept shabbat.)</p>\n<p>They would definitely be encouraged to believe in and serve H' though.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate sources in the comments for the following (I will bl\"n afterwards edit them in as appropriate):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Jewish soul is a different type than the non-Jewish soul.</li>\n<li>When undergoing a conversion to Judaism one's soul type changes.</li>\n<li>We encourage everyone to believe in and serve H', regardless of whether they are Jewish.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

It is merely explaining why the conclusion would be rejected even if the premise is correct.)</p>\n<p>I’m not sure if the laws you want to abolish are referring to Biblical laws or Rabbinic laws,  so let’s address both. Regarding Biblical laws, Maimonides in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:34 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this consideration it also follows that the laws cannot, like medicine, vary according to the different conditions of persons and times; whilst the cure of a person depends on his particular constitution at the particular time, the divine guidance contained in the Law must be certain and general, although it may be effective in some cases and ineffective in others. If the Law depended on the varying conditions of man, it would be imperfect in its totality, each precept being left indefinite. For this reason it would not be right to make the fundamental principles of the Law dependent on a certain time or a certain place; on the contrary, the statutes and the judgments must be definite, unconditional and general, in accordance with the divine words: \"As for the congregation, one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger\" (Num. xv. 15); they are intended, as has been stated before, for all persons and for all times.</p>\n<p>(Friedlander translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding Rabbinic laws, Maimonides in Hilchot Mamrim 2:2-3 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following rules apply when a court issued a decree, instituted an edict, or established a custom and this practice spread throughout the Jewish people and another court arose and sought to nullify the original order and eliminate the original edict, decree, or custom. The later court does not have this authority unless it surpasses the original court in wisdom and in its number of adherents. If it surpasses the original court in wisdom, but not in the number of adherents, or in the number of adherents, but not in wisdom, it cannot nullify its statements. <strong>Even if the rationale for which the original court instituted the decree or the edict is nullified, the later court does not have the authority to negate their statements unless they are greater.</strong></p>\n<p>How is it possible that the later court will surpass the original court in number? For every Supreme Sanhedrin consists of 71 judges. The intent is the number of sages in the generation who consent and accept the matter stated by the Supreme Sanhedrin without opposing it.</p>\n<p>When does the above apply? With regard to matters that were not forbidden to create a safeguard for the words of the Torah, but rather resemble other Torah laws. <strong>A different principle applies, by contrast, with regard to matters which the court sought necessary to issue a decree and create a prohibition as a safeguard. If the prohibition spread throughout the Jewish people, another Supreme Sanhedrin does not have the authority to uproot the decree and grant license even if it was of greater stature than the original court.</strong></p>\n<p>(Touger translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Rb Yaakov Weinberg, <em>avodah zarah</em> is any value system defined outside of the perimeters of the Torah. The entire world today is <em>mistovev</em> on re-defining value systems.</p>\n\n\n",

He attended religious elementary school and yeshivas, acquired the reputation of a prodigy, and prepared to become a rabbi.  After the traditional period of support from his father-in-law, he became a bookseller and worked at it until he was quite old.  He was the founder of the first Jewish lending library in his city, and although a religious man himself, he nevertheless influenced youngsters in the spirit of the Jewish Enlightenment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edit: Having searched through more of your link, I see that these two <em>were</em> the same person, as it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A library existed in Siedlce from the end of the nineteenth century. <strong>The owner of this library was Yitzchak Lipietz, a book dealer</strong>, who would sit between minchah and ma'ariv in the assembly room and study with the everyday Jews the portion of the week.

It's in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=626380&pagenum=32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his piece</a> explaining why the four cups aren't mentioned in the <em>Ma Nishtanah</em>. The following is an excerpt from an English <a href=\"https://parshaponders.com/pesach-tzav-5777/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writeup of that piece</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The prophet Yirmiyahu describes what happened when the Jews were exiled from Israel by the nation of Babylon <sup>1</sup>. He describes a vision of the matriarch Rachel crying for her children. Her cries echoed in the heavens and were accepted by Hashem. Why is it specifically Rachel? Undoubtedly the other foremothers were crying <sup>2</sup>, yet only Rachel’s cries are mentioned in the verse.</p>\n<p>The Jewish nation’s cries against the attacks from the Babylonians, the Edomites and the Amalekites stems from their overt baseless hatred they have for the Jews <sup>3</sup>. Most nations when they conquer a different nation don’t destroy all of their buildings. Rather, once captured, they add the buildings to their nation. This is not true with these nations. When the Edomites captured Jerusalem, they didn’t stop there; they destroyed the temple and all the surrounding buildings <sup>4</sup>. All of this came from pure hatred.</p>\n<p>When Reuven goes before a King and pleads for help from what Shimon did to him, perforce Reuven can’t have done the same injustice himself. Otherwise, why should the King bother to help Reuven when he himself is guilty of the same crime? The same is true with the other foremothers, who were surely crying when their descendants were sent into exile. Their cries couldn’t have been answered, because their children were just as guilty of baseless hatred. The ten sons of Yaakov sold Yosef to the Egyptians due to their baseless hatred <sup>5</sup>. Only Rachel and her children were clean from this sin. Yosef was the victim and Binyomin was too young to be involved in the sale. Therefore, only her cry regarding the baseless hatred being done to the Jews was answered <sup>6</sup>.</p>\n<p>The ruling of Pharaoh to reinstate the שר המשקים, the chief of the cup-bearers, and to execute the שר האופים, the chief of the bakers, seems to be backwards. What was their original crime? The שר המשקים failed to prevent a fly from entering the cup of the Egyptian King, and the שר האופים failed to notice a tiny needle which had fallen into the King’s bread <sup>7</sup>. The crime of the שר המשקים is substantial; he literally handed the King a cup of wine with a fly in it! It’s not normal for the baker to hand the bread directly to the King. Even though there ended up being a needle in it, it’s not as much of an affront to the King’s honor. In fact, the bread might not have even reached the King’s plate. Why was the one with the smaller crime punished with death, and the other reinstated? Also, why such an extreme ruling? Pharaoh could have simply fired them both. Why was this considered a capital crime? The Torah even calls their crime a sin; it’s surprising to call simple lack of attention a sin.</p>\n<p>A possible explanation is what was going on behind the scenes. The two ministers, due to their baseless hatred for one another, were brazen enough to try to get the other in trouble. The שר המשקים put a needle in the bread, and the שר האופים put the fly in the King’s cup. From this we see the sin of the שר האופים was much greater; he caused the שר המשקים to give the King a cup with a fly in it! That’s why he was sentenced to death. This is unlike the שר המשקים. Although putting the needle in the bread was a crime, there was a chance the King would have never even had that piece of bread. In the end, he was reinstated.</p>\n<p>Another explanation brought for the four cups of wine is they correspond to the four exiles that were destined to fall upon the Jews. The meaning behind this is clear. It makes sense to drink a cup of wine as celebration for every salvation that is given to us, as the verse states <sup>8</sup>: כוס ישועות אשא, the cup of salvations I will raise [to drink]. Since the four exiles will have four redemptions, we drink four cups of wine.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that the reason for most of the exiles is the sin of baseless hatred <sup>9</sup>. This is what the story of Yosef in prison is alluding to. Yosef was innocent from the sin of baseless hatred. The dream of the שר המשקים and its interpretation teaches us that just like baseless hatred caused them to be thrown in prison, the Jewish people’s baseless hatred of each other caused their four exiles. Each of these exiles deserves its own cup of wine to celebrate the salvation that was given to us, and the salvation that is yet to come.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Yirmiyahu</strong> 31:14</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Cf.</em> <strong>Eicha Rabbah</strong> <em>Pesikta</em> § 24 which only mentions the forefathers Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, as well as Moshe, crying and praying to Hashem alongside Rachel, with no mention of the other foremothers</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> See the prophets <strong>Amos</strong> 1:11, <strong>Ovadiah</strong> 1:1 and 1:12, and <strong>Psalms</strong> 137:7 who describe this baseless hatred</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Even though the verse with Rachel crying is referring to the Babylonian exile, the <strong>Leil Shimurim</strong> seems to switch the focus of the discussion to Edom and its descendants, including the nation of Amalek</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup> See <strong>Genesis</strong> Chapter 37. It’s not clear to me why it’s considered baseless hatred, the verses explicitly describe the source of their feelings towards Yosef</p>\n<p><sup>6</sup> This also explains why King Shaul and Queen Esther, descendants of Binyamin, were specifically chosen to combat Amalek and no one from the other tribes. It also explains the concept of Moshiach ben Yosef paving the way for Moshiach ben Dovid</p>\n<p><sup>7</sup> <strong>Rashi</strong> to <strong>Genesis</strong> 40:1, quoting <strong>Bereishis Rabbah</strong> 88:2</p>\n<p><sup>8</sup> <strong>Psalms</strong> 116:13</p>\n<p><sup>9</sup> <strong>Yoma</strong> 9b</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In addressing how Yosef interpreted the butler's dream in a positive way against the baker, <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/classics-and-beyond-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Avraham Bukspan in Classics and Beyond 1</a> (Mikeitz) quotes those who say the butler repeatedly noted his devoted service to Pharaoh: \"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I placed the cup on Pharaoh's palm.\" On the other hand, the baker passively described: \"There were three wicker baskets on my head. And in the topmost basket were all kinds of Pharaoh's food, the work of a baker, and the birds were eating them from the basket atop my head.\" The baker's lack of loyalty to the throne (\"it's just my day job\") revealed that only the devoted butler would reassume his responsibility.</p>\n<p>Based on this, perhaps we may suggest the four cups parallel butler's four cups because he wanted to devotedly serve his king similar to our nation risking our lives by following our King's command to slaughter and barbeque the sheep gods of Egypt.</p>\n\n\n",

Can the apples and nuts be used on Pesach, for example as charoset?</p>\n<p>My (limited) understanding is that the <em>ta'am</em> of a food is only transmitted from a vessel or utensil into the food item if heat is applied, or if the food has an intrinsic \"sharpness\" (like onions or radishes).  And in any case the <em>ta'am</em> of the chametz would be stale at the time the food is prepared.  Furthermore, we know that before Pesach chametz can be <em>batel</em>.  So it would seem that there is really no reason one could not use such food on Pesach.  And yet, I am sure that everyone would agree it may not be done.  What am I overlooking?</p>\n<p>A follow-up question:  What if instead of charoset, you are making home-made sauerkraut?  Again there is no heat, and no intrinsic sharpness in the cabbage.  The only difference here is that the chopped cabbage is pounded to soften it and bring out the brine, before being allowed to ferment.  Does either the act of pounding, or the natural fermentation process, behave analogously to heat insofar as the transmission of <em>ta'am</em> is concerned?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You write</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that there is really no reason one could not use such\nfood on Pesach. And yet, I am sure that everyone would agree it may\nnot be done. What am I overlooking?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first part of your statement was correct. You can actually use this food on Pesach if the cutting board and knives were clean and you are sure no <em>hametz</em> was around and might have mixed in.</p>\n<p>More than that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if before Pesach food was cooked (or remained soaking for 24 hours) in\na <em>hametz</em> utensil that was not a <em>ben yomo</em> [wasn't used for 24\nhours], the food may even be eaten on Pesach, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.447.5?lang=bi&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brura\n447:39</a> (quoted from footnote 4 to Artscroll's Kitzur Shulchan\nAruch 112:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason is that, as you write, taste doesn't transfer if the utensils are cold and clean. In addition, <em>hametz</em> that might be absorbed in the dishes is annulled in sixty times its volume before Pesach (but <strong>not</strong> during Pesach).</p>\n<p>Regarding the sauerkraut, there is indeed a rule of <em><a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-10-14/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kavush k'mevushal</a></em> (soaking is like cooking) but if the cabbage is clear of <em>hamets</em> and with the rule above, it can still be eaten during Pesach.</p>\n<p>Now whether or not you can rely on this ruling in practice, either before the fact or after the fact, depends on what your rabbi will tell you. In modern days, when getting Pesach dishes is so easy and cheap, there is less need to rely on leniencies and \"risky practices\".</p>\n<p>PS. As always things get complicated when cutting onions or other <em>davar charif</em> so the above might not apply directly in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this also the case for judaism?  I tried to seach the internet but got nothing.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to some, this appears to be the case. Nachmanides was convinced that G-d was constantly involved in the world, from a falling leaf to the winter snow. He wrote that there were no laws of nature. He felt that there was such a thing called \"hidden miracles.\" He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“From [belief in] large perceptible miracles one [comes to believe] in\nhidden miracles, which are the very foundation of the entire Torah. A\nperson has no share in the Torah of Moses our teacher until he\nbelieves that all that occurs is the result of miracles, not the laws\nof nature. … Everything happens by divine decree.”[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maimonides disagreed. He felt that the world works according to the laws of nature and that G-d is not involved in human affairs. He explains miracles as natural phenomena. Maimonides wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”through the interference of divine providence that a certain leaf falls [from a tree], nor do I hold that when a certain spider catches a certain fly, that this is the direct result of a special decree and\nwill of G-d in that moment… In all these cases the action is,\naccording to my opinion, entirely due to chance, as taught by\nAristotle… The prophets even express their surprise that G-d should\ntake notice of man, who is too little and too unimportant to be worthy\nof the attention of the Creator…. Study this chapter as it ought to be\nstudied; you will find in it all the fundamental principles of the\nlaw.”[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, there are two views. Nachmanides, who was a mystic felt that there are no laws of nature, everything happens by divine decree, whereas, Maimonides, who was a <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2020/04/a-maimonidean-view-of-why-coronavirus.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rationalist</a> felt that the world generally works according to the laws of nature that G-d created.</p>\n<p>[1] Nachmanides’ Commentary to Exodus 15:26</p>\n<p>[2] See Guide, 3:17 and 18</p>\n\n\n",

Even further research seeing Rabbi Akiva's argument/assertion/thoughts on the matter <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.36a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.  Outside of taking the leaven out of one's household <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/interlinear/exodus/12-17.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemoth/Exodus 12:17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0516.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim/Deuteronomy 16:3</a> makes mention of eating and guarding the Matzah in remembrance as a Zikron/Memorial and a Khag/Feast of the liberation.

From here we see that matzoh needs supervision that it does not become chometz. Matzoh that was not supervised like that can not be recommended for eating on Passover and may not be used at the Seder under any circumstances. It could be chometz, even though it most likely it isn't.</p>\n<p>This makes a difference. On the day before Passover one is not allowed to eat matzoh, and that should include unsupervised matzoh. However, matzoh produced specifically not for Passover is not included in the prohibition <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/121165/19563\">according to some opinions</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

They spread a sheet of fine linen between him and the people in the interest of modesty. And he sanctified his hands and his feet and removed his garments. Rabbi Meir says that this was the sequence: He first removed his garments and then he sanctified his hands and his feet. He descended and immersed a second time. He ascended and dried himself.

However, one can infer from other Rishonim (Tosafot, Rambam) that such <em>matzah</em> would still be included in the prohibition.</p>\n<p>Practically speaking, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%96%27%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Bezalel Zolty</a> seems to have permitted this practice, whereas <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Yaakov_Weiss\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yitzhak Ya'akov Weiss</a> forcefully opposed it.</p>\n<p>R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach was also reported to be opposed, although it may be possible to draw a distinction within his viewpoint between <em>matzot</em> manufactured without any particular intention at all, and those made specifically not to be used as <em>matzot mitzvah</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>The <em>mishnah</em> in Pesachim</strong></p>\n<p>The starting point for our discussion is the <em>mishnah</em> on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.99b.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 99b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עֶרֶב פְּסָחִים סָמוּךְ לַמִּנְחָה לֹא יֹאכַל אָדָם עַד שֶׁתֶּחְשַׁךְ.‏</p>\n<p>On the eve of Passover, adjacent to <em>minḥa</em> time, a person may not eat until dark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_on_Pesachim.99b.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosafot s.v. <em>lo yochal</em></a> inquire as to what precisely the <em>misnah</em> is forbidding one to eat at this time. After all, absent the ruling of the <em>mishnah</em>, one would not eat be able to eat <em>chametz</em> (which becomes forbidden after the fourth hour of the day), nor <em>matzah</em> (which the Yerushalmi forbids on <em>erev pesach</em>)?</p>\n<p>Tosafot answer that the <em>mishnah</em> is forbidding <em>matzah ashirah</em> from <em>mincha</em> time, which would otherwise be permitted. It is not <em>chametz</em>, but also does not fall into the category of forbidden <em>matzah</em> on <em>erev pesach</em>, because one cannot use it to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>matzah</em> at the <em>seder</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Meiri_on_Pesachim.99b.5?lang=bi&\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meiri</a> asks the same question as Tosafot, but gives other suggestions as to what the <em>mishnah</em> is prohibiting, including <em>betzeikot shel akum</em> - <em>matzah</em> manufactured by non-Jews, which cannot be used to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>matzah</em> at the <em>seder</em>, as it was produced <em>shelo lishmah</em>.</p>\n<p>So it seems clear from Meiri that one is allowed to eat such <em>matzot</em> on <em>erev pesach</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chidushei_Halachot_on_Pesachim.98b.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharsha</a> infers from Tosafot, who only suggest the eating of <em>matzah ashirah</em> on <em>erev pesach</em>, that they would prohibit <em>matzah shelo lishmah</em>. The rationale is that <em>matzah shelo lishmah</em> tastes exactly the same as <em>matzat mitzvah</em>, and would therefore be prohibited (as opposed to <em>matzah ashirah</em> which tastes different from <em>matzot mitzvah</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Rambam's position</strong></p>\n<p>Rambam writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Leavened_and_Unleavened_Bread.6.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Chametz uMatzah 6:12</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָסְרוּ חֲכָמִים לֶאֱכֹל מַצָּה בְּעֶרֶב הַפֶּסַח כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּהְיֶה הֶכֵּר לַאֲכִילָתָהּ בָּעֶרֶב.‏</p>\n<p>The sages have forbidden the eating of matzah on the day preceding Pesaḥ, in order to make it conspicuous at night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One could make a convincing case that Rambam would include eating <em>matzah shelo lishmah</em> in this prohibition, as it is not sufficiently distinguishable from the <em>matzah</em> one will eat at the <em>seder</em>.</p>\n<p>That being said, Rabbeinu Manoach (ad loc.) does allow eating <em>betzeikot shel akum</em> on <em>erev pesach</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Contemporary <em>poskim</em></strong></p>\n<p>R. Betzalel Zolty in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19954&st=&pgnum=103\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnat Ya'avetz Orach Chaim 16:5</a> argues for the approach of Meiri, and is willing to permit eating <em>matzot</em> produced <em>shelo lishmah</em> on <em>erev pesach</em>.</p>\n<p>In contrast, R. Yitchak Ya'akov Weiss in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1600&st=&pgnum=372\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchat Yitzchak VIII:37</a> strongly opposed using this innovation in practice.</p>\n<p>R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach is quoted in Shemirat Shabbat keHilchatah 56 f.n. 47 as also being opposed to the practice. He notes that any <em>matzah</em> which we would be willing to eat on <em>erev pesach</em> must have been specifically protected from turning into <em>chametz</em>. He believes that that in itself may be sufficient (<em>lechumrah</em>) to make it <em>matzah lishmah</em>, which would preclude its being eaten on <em>erev pesach</em>.</p>\n<p>R. Neuwirth notes that maybe one could distinguish between <em>matzot</em> produced without a specific intention that they be used for <em>matzat mitzvah</em>, where R. Shlomo Zalman's issue would arise, and <em>matzot</em> manufactured with specific intention that they not be usable for the <em>mitzvah</em>, which possibly could be eaten on <em>erev pesach</em>, even if they were manufactured while being protected from becoming <em>chametz</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The credibility of National revelation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was discussing the credibility of \"National Revelation\" as a standard to accept or reject proof. I am a science, mathematic and law orientated person and this threshold to accept or reject a proof is actually mathematically and logically unjust. In law we base things on <strong>probability</strong> and <strong>justice</strong>. Say if seven people witness a person murder someone, the probability that person killed the person is very high. In life we base everything on probability. You would not put your hand in a bee’s hive, because the probability you would get stung is very high. You go to school as there is a higher probability of a better job with education etc... To say this person did not commit the murder as the whole town did not witness it is unjust as he probability did do it and frankly is playing blind. We know from significance testing based on sound reasoning, which we use for drugs and vaccines, that a small sample gives good mean of the entire population. This is mathematically and logically a fact, a proof and a evidence, but is not necessary to go through the math to show you this it is also just common sense. (If you want to research more on sample size for significance testing do some research on \"power analysis\").</p>\n<p>If you believe that only a whole nation or the whole world discerning something is evidence then you should not take any vaccines or Drugs. I have worked with drugs for diabetes where we have published data on just 5 cells. To base evidence on a qualitative tag of \"a person\", \"a group\", \"a village\", \"a Town\", \"a nation\" or \"the world\" is not based on probability, And thus unjust as even if there are qualitative reasons why you think this is evidence, e.g. you as a Jewish nation together have witnessed, but in terms of probability this threshold is highly misleading to what is actually significant.</p>\n<p>In some qualitative respects as a non Jew, if you look at it morally your way Moses could never have been a messenger of God as the world did not witness his miracles, surly God carers for all. In fact, correct me if I am wrong but according to Talmud, 80% of the Jews did not even decide to leave, so the whole nation could not have experienced this; your children did not witness this sign.</p>\n<p>I have had experience with witchcraft and magic unfortunately being a victim of it and have some knowledge of how it is done, what it can do and what it cannot do. To have something speak to you and see something can be done by magic, to a person, a group or even a nation especially if the nation is stood in one place. In fact this is done very easily with magic.</p>\n<p>My question is why would you reject evidence based on probability? This way of reasoning is unjust, it does not weigh up the evidences for and against in a just way. Secondly if there was messenger now, what would it take for you to believe in Him, \"a town to witness\", \"a nation\" or \"the world\" where is the cut-off point.</p>\n<p>Please forgive the spelling as I am a science, mathematic and law orientated person and hate language/writing.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Few points to make.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The probability that Moses lied to a nation and they accepted his story without question is practically impossible. If Moses came down the mountain and lied the Jews would have never accepted the Torah. It is more likely that he was telling the truth or some other thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The cut-off point is a national revelation. Rabbi Joseph Albo in Sefer Ha-ikkarim says that a future prophet can technically abolish all the biblical commands except for the Ten Commandments but he must do so in front of mass witnesses.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A Midrash says there were one billion Jews in Egypt, but midrashim are parables, not factual history.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Lastly, magic does not exist.[1] You cannot fool an entire nation with magic. At some point, they will realize it is a trick. Additionally, if you drugged the people they will soon become sober and realize the trick. Besides, what masses today become drunk and fooled so easily?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, there is no alternative Jewish history. It's mathematical possibly, indeed acceptable to say something took place in the desert that changed the world forever. All three great world religions accept that Sinai revelation took place.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] The Ibn Ezra (to Leviticus, 19:31) says, \"Those with empty brains say 'were it not that fortune tellers and magicians were true, the Torah would not prohibit them.' But I (Ibn Ezra) say just the opposite of their words, because the Torah doesn't prohibit that which is true, but it prohibits that which is false. And the proof is the prohibition on idols and statues.....\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It would seem that two assumptions are being made which I believe are untrue. The first is that national revelation is a threshold standard. The second concerns the reason for national revelation.</p>\n<p>The national revelation during the Exodus from Egypt and at Mount Sinai is a historical fact. It is exceptional evidence that God actually relates to the Jewish nation as recorded in the Torah. But that is not the standard needed to accept someone as a prophet. Moses was accepted by the people in Egypt with three minor signs, and perhaps even that was superfluous. National revelation is, however, the gold standard. Once there was national revelation, no lesser revelation can contradict it.</p>\n<p>So, to answer the question, would we reject a prophet who performs miracles or even makes predictions that are witnessed by as few as two people? No, we would not reject him, but with a condition. If the prophet is in line with the teachings of Moses, he is to be believed; if he contradicts Moses, he is not to be believed.</p>\n<p>The second assumption I would like to address, tangentiality, is the purpose of the revelation at Sinai. All people of the world would be expected to accept it, but it is not directly relevant to non-Jews. The purpose was to establish an absolute trust in the teaching of Moses. To show that God exists and runs the world was already demonstrated in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Once this was established, there is no need for reestablishing it for future generations; the fathers will teach the children. There was no need for the revelation to be for other nations; the commandments were not given to them. The fact that much of the nation did not leave Egypt is of no consequence, as they were not included in the commandments either (they were dead, BTW).

But the voice was only one part of the whole experience. Can magic produce \"sounds and lightning, and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the very strong sound of a horn\"?

After seeing the Ten Plagues and the Splitting of the Sea?</p>\n<p>And even if the external events could have been achieved by magic, who are we to question the ones who experienced the prophecy and said \"today we have seen that God can speak to a person and he can live.\" They were sure that it was really God speaking to them; how can we argue?</p>\n\n\n",

The Rabbi then said: “Such, too, is the way of the Holy One, blessed be He: although it was clear to Him that in the end men would sin and would be destroyed, He did not refrain from creating them for the sake of the righteous men who were to issue from them” (Genesis Rabbah 27:4).</blockquote>\n<p>Based on Rashi's example, <strong>are we required to defend the Omniscience of HaShem?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not necessarily, although it would be good to do so.</p>\n<p>Ralbag felt that G-d does not know the future. ibn Ezra wrote that G-d only knows generalities but not the details.</p>\n\n\n",

But with that said, hopefully, you will find this helpful.</p>\n<p>You open your question by asking, \"How do you become a <em>Baal Teshuvah?\"</em></p>\n<p>For many, this specific term (in English, someone who has mastered the process of <em>returning to G-d</em>) has a particular meaning relating to someone who is working on themselves to correct some kind of transgression either against G-d, or their fellow human beings, or both and has completed that work. This concept is discussed in many places, but one clearly worded place discussing it is in Rambam's Mishneh Torah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Laws of Teshuvah, Chapter 2, Law 1</a>.</p>\n<p>But reading the balance of your question indicates that you mean this in a more general sense. That you are trying to learn more about what it means to incorporate traditional Jewish observance into your life on a daily basis. And that is a very big question indeed!</p>\n<p>While agreeing with all the good recommendations already offered by mbloch in the first answer, I would suggest that you might find the following very helpful because of its broadly encompassing nature.</p>\n<p>Rambam, Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, wrote an all encompassing book dealing precisely with the subject of your very big question entitled Mishneh Torah.</p>\n<p>Rambam himself wrote in his introduction to this book that any Jew who used his book would not require any other resource to know what was required to live a traditional Jewish life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Therefore, have I</strong>, Moses son of Maimon, of Spain, girded up my loins, and, supporting myself upon the Rock, blessed be He, made a comprehensive study of all those books and <strong>minded myself</strong> <strong>to construct out of all these compilations a clear summary on the subject</strong> of that which is forbidden or permitted, defiled or clean along with the other laws of the Torah, the whole scope in pure language and concise style, <strong>so that the Oral Torah be entirely methodical in the mouth of everybody,</strong> without query and without repartee, without the contentious thus of one and such of another, but <strong>clear text, cohesive, correct, in harmony with the law which is defined out of all these existing compilations and commentaries from the days of our Holy Master till now; so that all laws be open to young and old,</strong> whether they be laws concerning each and every commandment or whether they be laws concerning matters instituted by scholars and prophets. <strong>The main object of the matter being, that no man shall have a need of any other compilation in the world for any law of the laws of Israel</strong>, but this compilation shall be a cyclopedia of the whole Oral Torah together with a code of the statutes, customs and edicts which were enacted since the days of Moses our Master until the close of the Talmud, even as they were interpreted for us by the Gaonim in all their compilations which were compiled by them since the Talmudic era. <strong>Therefore, have I named this compilation Mishneh Torah; for, when one studies Holy Writ first and thereafter reads this Work, he obtains herefrom a complete knowledge of the Oral Torah, having no need to read any other book in between them.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book is intended to be read in order and each idea presented is built upon what preceeds it. The following link will connect you to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Overview_of_Mishneh_Torah_Contents.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the beginning of his overview to the contents of the Mishneh Torah</a>.</p>\n<p>May it be a continuous source of inspiration for you in learning how to take on traditional Jewish observance so that you may progress for the rest of your life, going from strength to strength and may it be with joy (<em><strong>Serve G-d with joy!</strong></em>) and without boredom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It would appear than your efforts can nominally be divided into the following areas</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Halachah</strong>: E.g. shabbos, keeping kosher</li>\n<li><strong>Emunah</strong>: Belief in Hashem and Divine providence, e.g. includes <em>tefillah</em> (prayer) and seeing the hand of Hashem in your everyday life</li>\n<li><strong>Personality development</strong>: I once saw a very nice comment from a <em>ba'al teshuvah</em> as follows, \"Of course it was traumatic becoming a <em>ba'al teshuvah</em>.

    "title": "How do I resist the urge to use my phone on Shabbat, and have fun?",
    "content": "# How do I resist the urge to use my phone on Shabbat, and have fun?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I get bored on shabbat and have a hard time staying away from my phone do you have any advice for fun things to do on Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This question is more a psychological one and it really depends on your personal situation. I will try to answer a bit more generally.</p>\n<h2>1.   Keep the phone away</h2>\n<p>The easiest first step, regardless of all else,  is to keep the phone in a place that is inaccessible in moments of weakness. If you use the phone as an alarm clock consider an alternative alarm clock for Shabbat. If you use the phone as an alarm so that you can use its functionality to automatically switch off after a set amount of seconds, then consider keeping it in a drawer so that you can still hear the alarm, but can’t see the phone. Every psychical and visual barrier between you and your phone will help prevent giving in to the urge to use it. Don’t make it a battle of willpower, because you will lose that battle eventually.</p>\n<h2>2.   Be wary of conditioned behavior.</h2>\n<p>Regardless of your situation it is important to realize humans are creatures of habit. As such it helps to keep in mind that the urge to use the phone can feel like the urge to entertain, but is most likely in large part the urge to keep your routine. It is not really possible to just stop doing something that has become routine and which has become a behaviour that is associated with other behaviour; it needs to be replaced with a new routine.\nMany people are aware of Pavlov’s research into classical conditioning, where a dog would start drooling whenever a bell was rung after having been served food whenever a bell was rung repeatedly. Similarly, casual phone use, like smoking, gambling and other ‘addictive’ behaviour is difficult to stop because we condition ourselves, even when discounting the chemistry behind certain behaviours. If you are used to pick up the phone whenever you crash on the couch, merely sitting on the couch will trigger the urge to then also pick up the phone.</p>\n<p>There are two things one can do to break this conditioned habit: If you use the phone whenever you sit on the couch it can be helpful to sit on a different part of the couch, or a comfy chair, if available. Do things on Shabbat differently. Alternatively, you can change your behaviour with the phone during the week. For example, condition yourself to use the phone more deliberately so that you have an easier time deviating from that routine on Shabbat. It doesn’t really matter how you do it, as long as you make it easier for yourself to live your day on Shabbat without constantly doing something that you (unconsciously) associate with using your phone.</p>\n<h2>3.   Fill the empty space</h2>\n<p>It is not always easy to change routine behaviour, especially at home. The easiest way to break up the routine is to prepare for a Shabbat routine. Delay the moment that you would normally start looking for the phone. The first few Shabbatot will feel off, but over time your body will adapt to a new Shabbat routine.\nThe key here is <strong>preparation</strong>. As I mentioned earlier, never make a habit change become a battle of willpower, because that is a losing battle. Any ad-hoc solutions are potentially failing solutions. It helps to run the Shabbat-script in your head ahead of Shabbat. Some activities can help with minimizing the time where you need to find the motivation in yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Synagogue. It can depend on your community how long the Shabbat service is relative to how long Shabbat is. I live in an area and far enough from shul so that after Shabbat-shacharit it is about 14:00 when I get home.</li>\n<li>Invite guests. Or be a guest. Inviting friends, tourists, family are ways to stretch the day with a new routine. I used to be fearful of inviting people over for Shabbat lunch because I was really unsure about my Shabbat-cooking, but I told my guests that they were welcome at 15:00 for a conversation later. In time I had no issue with taking guests home from shul for a simple lunch. Before you know it you will have had fun talking, singing and eating with your guest(s) and it is already 16:00. Depending on the time of year and where you live this might mean that Mincha-Maariv is soon. In the summer months you still need to ‘survive’.</li>\n<li>Prepare an activity: get yourself excited about a book you will read, or buy a board-game that you can enjoy. Try to deliberately set Shabbat aside as a part of the week where you can do new things you get excited about. Don’t look for a good book when Shabbat has started, but pick it at least a day in advance.</li>\n<li>Go for a nap. The ‘shabbes-shluf’ is a great way to re-energize yourself and to not become bored.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are probably many more suggestions, but you probably get where I am going with this: don’t try to get through Shabbat with ad-hoc activities, but try to make a mental script of how you are going to spend your time on Shabbat. Some have had Shabbat-routines ingrained in them through childhood, or have spent many years building their own in adulthood. But don’t be discouraged if it feels that you are the only one who struggles. Everyone struggles with the break in their routine behavior, some just have the luxury of experience in dealing with it.</p>\n<p>So the bottom-line is to make sure you have a battle plan: start with an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ approach so that you have to cross a few barriers before you can indulge an urge. Keep the urge under control by firstly finding sufficient distractions and avoid mundane weekly-routines, and secondly by planning for alternative activities.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>So I'm assuming you go to shul on Shabbos. That gives you a couple of hours to daven to Hashem. Tell him your struggles and ask him for help. Then after shul you can eat kiddush, take a nap, read a book, or play a game. Fun games to play on shabbos include chess, rummikub, and checkers. Hangout with some friends, maybe do a little learning. Take a walk with some family members, and talk about your week. Hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Belsky rules that it is chometz and must be put away and sold for Pesach.

If you would add cyanide to the Play-Doh before Pesach, then everyone would agree that it is no longer Chometz and can be kept.

    "content": "# Burning chametz when one still has chametz left over\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While it is accepted that the mitzva of <em>biur chametz</em> can be accomplished in different ways (see e.g. Shulchan Aruch O.C. 445:1 and Mishna Berurah 445:1-2, cited <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Biur_Chametz#Burning_or_Other_Means\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), there is also an accepted practice to specifically accomplish the <em>biur</em> by burning the chametz (see Ramo ad loc).  This may be based on the view of Rabbi Yehuda in the Mishna in Pesachim 21a. The Kaf Hachayim (445:11), suggests that specifically <em>burning</em> the chametz symbolizes burning of the evil inclination.</p>\n<p>According to Rabbenu Tam (Tosfoth Pesachim 12b s.v. <em>eimatay</em>) even Rabbi Yehuda holds that before midday of <em>erev pesach</em> one can dispose of chametz in any way. Nonetheless, the Tur (OC 445:1), basing himself on the opinion of Rashi (and arguing with his father the Rosh [Pesachim 2:3]), suggests  that there is a mitzvah to burn the chametz even before midday.</p>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon (ad loc) suggests that even according to the chachamim who argue with Rabbi Yehuda, one should ideally burn the chametz.  However, the reason it is not obligatory is because, even according to Rabbi Yehuda the chametz would need to be burned <em>after</em> its prohibited time.  Since we do our <em>biur</em> before that time, it can really be done any way.</p>\n<p>According to those opinions that there is value in specifically burning chametz even before the time it becomes prohibited, is this also true when the person will still have other chametz that he will not dispose of by fire?  Or is the idea of <em>biur</em> through fire only of value if the act of burning results in there no longer being any chametz in the person's possession? For example, this year when Erev Pesach falls out on Shabbath and most have the practice to continue to eat chametz until Shabbath morning, is there any value in doing a token burning of some of one's chametz - e.g. of that found during the search Thursday night?</p>\n\n\n",

All the more so, if one does respond he will become more heretical. His heresy is assumed to be intentional, and any attempt to rebut it will only cause him to reinforce his position.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That does not mean you need to waste your breath, but you should show them that you did not come to your positions out of ignorance.

This person then went on to complete a conversion course from a different denomination. This person told me that their Orthodox rabbi considers them to be a Noachide, not accepting, naturally, the legitimacy of their conversion.\nI am aware, also, that this person believes in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Documentary Hypothesis</a> and that many of the stories in the Torah are myths (which is one aspect of the original Hypothesis by Graf-Wellhausen), including, ironically, the story of Noach and the flood.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to my question: The story of Noach includes the covenant between Hashem and Noach and the giving of the Noachide commandments.

If you believe an olive is 27cm3 (<a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Reference_of_Measurements_in_Halacha#Kezayit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>), which for barley converts into 16.2 grams (according to <a href=\"https://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-to-weight\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a>), then <strong>an olive's worth of barley is 1.13cl of whiskey</strong> (16.2 grams * 70 cl of whiskey / 1000 grams of barley).</p>\n<p>As to your second question, of why there is a prohibition on liquid chametz, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.120a.21?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 120a</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reish Lakish said: One is liable even for drinking leavened bread. The\nverse states: “For all who eat leavened bread from the first day until\nthe seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel” (Exodus\n12:15). The term “soul” is interpreted homiletically to include in the\nprohibition one who drinks leavened bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now all is to be <em>chayav m’doaraisa</em>. As is well known, one if forbidden to consume <em>chametz</em> on Pesach in minute quantities, as the Radbaz (quoted at the end <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/prohibitions-chametz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) nicely explains</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, I rely upon that which the Rabbis taught that <strong>chametz\nsymbolizes the “evil inclination,”</strong> the “se’or she-be-issa.” <strong>Therefore,\na person should utterly banish it from his midst and search for it in\nall of the inner chambers of his consciousness, as even the smallest\namount is not nullified.</strong> And this is true and correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Passover occurred on the fourteenth day of the first month, Nisan, the first month of the year. However, when the Jews were exiled to Babylon in 586 BCE, they discovered the Babylonian calendar.[1] As a result, they changed it to the seventh month Rosh Hashanah, “New Year.” The talmudic rabbis said that the world was created in Nisan.</p>\n<p>[1] Also, the names of the months were renamed after Babylonian months.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Remembering the exodus was an important part of Israelite identity, at least in the northern kingdom.  It is mentioned by the prophet Hosea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Israel was a child, I loved him\nand out of Egypt I have called my son.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Passover is mentioned, in a negative way, by the prophet Amos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold, I am setting a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass by them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in a positive way by the book of Deuteronomy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Observe the season of ripe grain, and keep passover to the Lord your God, for in the season of ripe grain the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>חדש normally means \"month\", but it can mean \"season\", Jeremiah 2.23-24.</p>\n<p>In pre exilic Israel and Judah, the calendar year began in the fall.  In the late pre exilic period or the early exilic period, the Israelites adopted the Babylonian calendar, which has a new year in the spring.  The author of Exodus 12.2 is using this state of affairs to illustrate the same point made by the book of Deuteronomy:  remembering the exodus.  The Passover Haggadah makes the same point when it states that every Israelite should view himself as having come out of Egypt.</p>\n<p>As for why the exodus happened in the springtime rather than as some other time:  why shouldn't it happen in spring, the season of new beginnings?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>We find in the [Mishnah][1] that there are multiple New Years in the Jewish calendar, one of which is the first of Nissan.</p>\n<p>אַרְבָּעָה רָאשֵׁי שָׁנִים הֵם. בְּאֶחָד בְּנִיסָן רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לַמְּלָכִים וְלָרְגָלִים. בְּאֶחָד בֶּאֱלוּל רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לְמַעְשַׂר בְּהֵמָה. רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אוֹמְרִים, בְּאֶחָד בְּתִשְׁרֵי. בְּאֶחָד בְּתִשְׁרֵי רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לַשָּׁנִים וְלַשְּׁמִטִּין וְלַיּוֹבְלוֹת, לַנְּטִיעָה וְלַיְרָקוֹת. בְּאֶחָד בִּשְׁבָט, רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לָאִילָן, כְּדִבְרֵי בֵית שַׁמַּאי. בֵּית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים, בַּחֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר בּוֹ:   T\nThey [sic: should be there] are four days in the year that serve as the New Year, each for a different purpose: On the first of Nisan is the New Year for kings; it is from this date that the years of a king’s rule are counted. And the first of Nisan is also the New Year for the order of the Festivals, as it determines which is considered the first Festival of the year and which the last. On the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes; all the animals born prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and are tithed as a single unit, whereas those born after that date belong to the next tithe year. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: The New Year for animal tithes is on the first of Tishrei. On the first of Tishrei is the New Year for counting years, as will be explained in the Gemara; for calculating Sabbatical Years and Jubilee Years, i.e., from the first of Tishrei there is a biblical prohibition to work the land during these years; for planting, for determining the years of orla, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden; and for tithing vegetables, as vegetables picked prior to that date cannot be tithed together with vegetables picked after that date. On the first of Shevat is the New Year for the tree; the fruit of a tree that was formed prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and cannot be tithed together with fruit that was formed after that date; this ruling is in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai. But Beit Hillel say: The New Year for trees is on the fifteenth of Shevat.</p>\n<p>And as to why the Torah focuses on the leaving of Egypt over the cessation of work, the answer is that the work ended only because the Egyptians no longer had the capacity to enforce the rules. The Jews were not truly free until they left Egypt completely, and the Egyptian people were destroyed.\n[1]: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n\n\n",

Ed.] The sound was meant to alert the people that the time for him to perform the service in the Tabernacle had arrived.

A <em>siddur</em> is a Jewish prayer book used for daily prayer, and for some holidays. This is not quite the same as a <em>machzor</em>, a <em>bentcher</em>, a <em>haggadah</em> or a <em>tiklal</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>In halakhic matters, it is common to use technical terminology from the Talmud or other rabbinic works where these matters are discussed. In modern Law, Latin terms are similarly often used in part because historically, Latin was the <em>lingua franca</em> of legal discourse. Just as a lawyer says <em>a fortiori</em>, a Yeshiva bochur may say <em>kal vakhomer</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>HAY terms can be prestige markers, since they reflect the education level of the speaker. This is analogous to the situation in Yiddish, where Aramaic words and phrases are used far more frequently by those (primarily men) educated in halakha.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>HAY terms can be used to distinguish Jewish religious terms from secular terms or analogous terms in other religions. I already mentioned how <em>Shabbat</em> (or <em>Shabbes</em>) can be used in contradistinction to <em>Sabbath</em>. <em>Bible</em> is another example of a term often associated with Christianity, which is why some Jews prefer <em>TaNaKh</em> or <em>mikra</em>. Some terms can even be used by Jews to distinguish themselves from other Jews. For instance, <em>Temple</em> is a word for Synagogue used by Reform and other liberal denominations, with the notion that they act as replacements for the destroyed temple in Jerusalem. Orthodox Jews, however, will often use the traditional Yiddish terms <em>shul</em> or <em>shil</em>. To quote the <a href=\"https://jel.jewish-languages.org/welcome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish English Lexicon</a> website:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Jews use words from this list within their English speech or\nwriting, they indicate not only that they are Jewish but also that\nthey are a certain type of Jew. Some are Yiddish lovers, some are\nengaged in religious life and learning, some have a strong connection\nto Israel, some have Sephardi heritage, and some are all of the above.\nBecause Jewish and non-Jewish social networks overlap, these words are\nnot used exclusively by Jews. Some are English words that certain Jews\nuse in distinctive ways, and some are Yiddish-origin words that have\nbecome part of the English language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The usage of HAY terms in English speech tends to be restricted to Jewish circles, while in secular communcation these terms are not used. It is is therefore an instance of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">code-switching</a>. For more information on Jewish modes of English, see the chapter \"Jewish English\" by Benor, in the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=3IJ1DwAAQBAJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Handbook of Jewish Languages</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Most of the users of this site are currently observing Pesach, so please do not be offended if you do not get an authoritative response for at least a couple of days. I am a Gentile believer, and am as such not permitted to observe Pesach, so I will do my best to ‘mind the shop’ whilst the more informed members of the community are away.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you will see in Genesis (Beresheit) 1 that G-d uses the Hebrew language to name things - Day, Night, the Sky etc. - before ever a man was created. Note that in this chapter G-d is speaking ‘internally’: He is not addressing anyone outside Himself because these words were internal to G-d. It therefore follows that the Hebrew language is the language of G-d Himself, ‘in the beginning’: it has a special and preeminent status among languages. And if G-d says something is called X, then that is what it is, essentially.</p>\n<p>You will see in Isaiah (Yeshayahu) 45 that Hashem, our god, speaks the Truth, and that He declares what is right. He did not say that English is the right way to speak of the essence of things. He declared, in using Hebrew to name the attributes of Creation, that the Hebrew language speaks of the essence of things. You will be aware of that famous question, ‘What is Truth?’. Jews will tell you that Truth is G-d’s seal. It is His thoughts, His wisdom, His understanding, that is Truth. And if G-d is unchanging (see Malachi 3), then Truth must be unchanging. Knowing the proper names of things is part of the Truth.</p>\n<p>So, to answer your question, we use Hebrew words in the midst of English because we know that these are the correct ways of speaking of what we are speaking about. If one knows the correct way of speaking the Truth, but chooses to use another way of speaking, he is basically lying or deceiving. Using Hebrew words in the midst of English or any other language is a reminder that English is not a ‘final vocabulary’ and that we ought to be aware of the difference between Hebrew and other languages, and Hebrew speakers and other peoples.</p>\n<p>You can find a much deeper explanation of the Jewish relation to Hebrew, on the one hand, and secular languages, on the other, in Part Three, Book One, of Franz Rosenzweig’s Star of Redemption (first published 1921 CE). This book may perhaps help you on your quest. Please let me know if you require any clarifications. Keep seeking.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maybe similar to the reason Christians use the Hebrew words amen, hallelujah, hosanna. It is quicker than explaining them in English.

My question is what does \"חַיִל\" mean?  Does the denotation only have to only do with courage, bravery, might as pertaining to some sort of battle?  Is there a connotation of substance (spiritual, mental, physical, wealth, prosperity, health, etc)?  For example, would somebody who has a joyous life and a loving family but is dirt poor be considered to have or be of Chayil?

And if it enters your mind to say that the verse means this literally, there could be times when you find a case where both an eye and a life are taken for an eye, i.e., when the one who caused the damage is so weak that as the court blinds his eye, his soul departs from his body.\" (for more, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/search?q=%D7%93%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%94&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so forth.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chasam Sofer on Sefiras HaOmer\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard a mind-blowing idea a couple of years back in the name of the Chasam Sofer, and I would really love to know the source....</p>\n<p>It says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 23:15</a> -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּסְפַרְתֶּ֤ם לָכֶם֙ מִמָּחֳרַ֣ת הַשַּׁבָּ֔ת מִיּוֹם֙ הֲבִ֣יאֲכֶ֔ם אֶת־עֹ֖מֶר הַתְּנוּפָ֑ה <strong>שֶׁ֥בַע שַׁבָּת֖וֹת תְּמִימֹ֥ת</strong> תִּהְיֶֽינָה׃</p>\n<p>And from the day on which you bring the sheaf of elevation offering—the day after the sabbath—you shall count off <strong>seven weeks - They must be complete</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst these seven complete weeks are understood halachically that one needs to count the days consecutively without dropping a day (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.306.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch 306:5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.161.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaMitzvos 162</a>) they can also be seen as a qualitative measure, namely an auspicious time to work on oneself - a time for self improvement and an 'aliyah' (elevation) in ruchniyos (spiritual matters). We know that the Jewish people at the time of leaving Mitzrayim (Egypt) were on the 49th level of tumah (impurity) and with each subsequent day, ascended till they were on the requisite level of holiness to receive the Torah (e.g. see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kedushat_Levi%2C_Numbers%2C_For_the_Sefira.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kedushas Levi</a>). Thus with each day of sefirah, we are gifted the opportunity to improve ourselves and grow closer to Hakadosh Boruch Hu.</p>\n<p>Now here's the Chasam Sofer....</p>\n<p>The Chasam Sofer wrote (somehere?!!) that a person can, during this 49 day period, achieve great heights, and on each individual day of Sefirah, can rectify that which would normally require two years of toil. As a result, 49 days of Sefirah (when used productively) can equate to 98 years worth of aliyah in ruchniyus!!!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Maybe you're thinking of <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21254&st=&pgnum=146&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Drashos Chasam Sofer II p. 280a</a> (Sefiras HaOmer, halfway down the right column):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזהו שאמר בפרשה זו (ויקרא כ\"ה ח') \"וספרת לך שבע שבתות שנים שבע שנים שבע פעמים והיו לך ימי שבע שבתות השנים תשע וארבעים שנה\", סיפא דקרא הוא כפול. אבל הענין רומז על ימי הספירה, שבכל שנה ושנה שנקדש אותם, ונספור מלשון זכזוך וספירה, שיהיו ספורים ומזוככים אצלנו עד שיחשב יום לשנה יום לשנה כידוע, ויעלו לנו מ\"ט יום למ\"ט שנה, ועם יום החג יום מתן תורה יהיה נחשב לחמישים שנה בקדושה. והנה ידוע כי כל יום, יום כפול הוא, כי מנה של קדש כפול הוא (ב\"ב צ' ע\"ב), ונקרא ימי שמים וארץ, כימי השמים על הארץ (דברים י\"א כ\"א), לכן כתיב (במדבר י\"ד ל\"ד) יום לשנה יום לשנה, ב' פעמים. ולכן אם תהיינה זה שבתות אלו תמימות בקדושה, אזי יחשבו חמישים ימים למאה שנה, סוד מאה ברכות, מאה אדנים במקדש כידוע.</p>\n<p>This is what it says in this <em>parsha</em>, \"You shall count for yourselves seven Sabbaths of years, seven years seven times. They days of the seven Sabbaths of years shall be for you 49 years\" (Leviticus 25:8). The end of this verse is redundant. Rather, the matter is a hint to the days of <em>Sefirah</em>. That is, every year that we sanctify them, and counting is a language of purification, that these days should be purified with respect to ourselves, until the days become equal to years (as is known). These 49 days would [then] become equivalent to 49 years, and including Shavuos, the festival of the giving of the Torah, this would be equivalent to 50 years in holiness. Behold, it is known that every day is really a double day, as the portion of holiness is double (Bava Basra 90b), and is called the days of heaven and earth, like the days of the heavens on the earth (Deuteronomy 11:21). Therefore it is written, \"a year for a day, a year for a day\" (Numbers 14:34), two times. Therefore, if these weeks will be perfect in holiness, then these 50 days will be considered 100 years. This is the secret of 100 blessings [every day], and the 100 sockets in the Temple, as is known.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This characterization brought forth the Talmudic Eliyahu who is an everyday teacher of the sages, typically depicted in sharing his secret wisdom or resolving conflicts, as well as serving as a mediator between Hashem and Am Yisrael, an especially necessary role in light of the loss of the Temple.</p>\n<p>Chaim Boaz in his Hebrew MA thesis, <em>Elijah and the Rabbis: Story and Theology</em> (סיפורי גילוי אליהו בספרות התלמודית), Bar-Ilan University 2022, similarly argued that the Eliyahu of the Talmudic literature is a distinct character from the wrathful, zealous figure in Tanach. In the Talmudic literature he is a hybrid figure. One aspect is his angelic aspect, where he acts as a mediator between men, and especially, the sages, and Hashem. This includes providing the sages with esoteric wisdom. The other aspect is his human aspect, where he assists people - including simple people, such as children - usually in normal, non-miraculous ways. A later development is the usage of this new Talmudic-Eliyahu as a trope planted into older legends, sometimes replacing original characters.</p>\n<p>As for my own theory (which I can naturally describe in more detail, but will still do my best to condense it as much as possible):</p>\n<p>In my seminary paper, I argued that many different sources and phenomena demonstrate that starting from the middle or late 2nd century CE and onward, a form of messianic despair or disbelief appeared especially among some Jews (and also perhaps among Christians, but I won't get into that here). For the chapter on this phenomenon as reflected in the words of one of the (IMO) tannaim, the mysterious Rabbi Hillel, see it linked in the comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/131499/opinion-that-mashiach-came-already/131502#131502\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>One of these phenomena, I argued, is the rise in popularity of Eliyahu, seemingly overshadowing the figure of the Mashiach. Indeed, the number of figures we know to have been in contact with Eliyahu from the Tannaitic period (i.e., those involving Tannaim, or contemporaries) is smaller than in the Amoraic period (according to a list I made, in the Tannaitic period there were between 11 to 13, while in the Amoraic period there were 20).</p>\n<p>The explanation for this, I believe, is symbolized well in the famous story of Rabbi Yehoshua b. Levi meeting Eliyahu and asking him when the Mashiach will come. Eliyahu directs him to the Mashiach himself, who's sitting among beggars by the gates of Rome. When asked when he'll bring the Redemption, the Mashiach responds: \"Today!\". Rabbi Yehoshua is at first very happy, until he discovers that the response hinges upon Am Yisrael being worthy of redemption (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.98a.15-17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Sanhedrin 98a</a>). A little-discussed aspect of the story is that Rabbi Yehoshua had no problem in identifying Eliyahu, but needed identity markers from Eliyahu to recognize the Mashiach. This signifies a certain spiritual gap: While Eliyahu, the semi-angel, is always near and recognizable, the ostensibly human Mashiach is not easily recognized, as well as being far, both physically (in Rome and not Eretz Yisrael or even Babylon) and spiritually.</p>\n<p>There are also some archeological findings that may be associated with the rise in popularity of Eliyahu, such as the Jewish and later Christian appropriation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Elijah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cave of Eliyahu</a> in Mt. Carmel, the appearance of the name of Eliyahu on Christian pottery lamps of the period, as well as a possibility that the Helios-like figure at the center of zodiac wheels in shuls was identified by contemporaries with Eliyahu (as first <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/157102/Wadeson_L_2008_Chariots_of_fire_Elijah_and_the_zodiac_in_synagogue_floor_mosaics_of_Late_Antique_Palestine_ARAM_20_1_41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proposed</a> by Lucy Wadeson), and more.</p>\n<p>In other words, setting aside the question of whether or not the sages actually met Eliyahu,<sup>1</sup> I believe that his steadily-rising appearances in Talmudic stories are a reflection of a phenomenon whereby his figure became more popular than that of the Mashiach. Eliyahu represented a highly spiritual and esoteric yet friendly, knowledgeable and reliable figure that Jews of the period could lean on for support during the difficult last centuries of the pagan Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire, unlike the Mashiach who sits waiting by the gate of Rome, or, according to a different aggadah, was swept far away (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.4.12?ven=hebrew%7CThe_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Brachot 2:4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eikhah_Rabbah.1.51?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah 1:51</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereshit_Rabbati%2C_Parashat_Vayetze.35?ven=hebrew%7CJerusalem,_1940&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbati 30:41</a>).<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Not wanting to make this answer any longer, I will note that I also attempted to argue that contrary to most scholars who argued that Talmudic Eliyahu is vastly different from Tanachic Eliyahu (and hence, fictitious), I believe that a careful reading of Tanach (see especially that which was suggested by Yosi Baruchi, <em>The Acts of Elijah and Elisha</em> [מעשי אליהו ואלישע], Merkaz Shapira 5781) shows that Eliyahu's zeal was always for Am Yisrael, and less-so for Hashem, a pattern that continues in the assistance he provides people in the Talmudic sources.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> The Beresheet Rabbati version is particularly ironic and IMO especially demonstrative of my theory, given that it presents none other than <em>Eliyahu</em> as the man searching for the baby Mashiach and despairing when winds - very similar to the winds that swept him in a chariot of flames in Tanach - swept away the baby.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a scriptural prohibition of establishing more than one Temple?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm aware of the fact that traditionally, there was one Mishkan and, derivatively, one Temple. I completely understand the logic of it - one nation, one God, one Temple. On the other hand, there are some speculations to the opposite: historically, there were alternative Jewish temples in parallel to the one in Jerusalem, for example, in Egypt or Motzah near Jerusalem; Bamot services were allowed in parallel; multiple Temples do not undermine God's unity or universality; God says \"אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר י\"א בּוֹ\" - \"...<em>the place that the LORD your God will have chosen</em>\", not specifying a place; and more.</p>\n<p>I'm interested to know if there are scriptural prohibitions (not a Rabbinic interpretation, like \"מקום\" is single therefore only one Temple) against establishing more than one Temple, maybe one per tribe, one per country, etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>We find in the book of Joshua ch. 22 that when the tribes on the other side of the Jordan built an altar on their land, that the entire Jewish people was ready to go to war with them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּשְׁמְע֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֵאמֹ֑ר הִנֵּ֣ה בָנ֣וּ בְנֵֽי־רְאוּבֵ֣ן וּבְנֵי־גָ֡ד וַחֲצִי֩ שֵׁ֨בֶט הַֽמְנַשֶּׁ֜ה אֶת־הַמִּזְבֵּ֗חַ אֶל־מוּל֙ אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן אֶל־גְּלִילוֹת֙ הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן אֶל־עֵ֖בֶר בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃\nA report reached the Israelites: “The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar opposite the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, across from the Israelites.”\n12\nוַֽיִּשְׁמְע֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וַיִּקָּ֨הֲל֜וּ כָּל־עֲדַ֤ת בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ שִׁלֹ֔ה לַעֲל֥וֹת עֲלֵיהֶ֖ם לַצָּבָֽא׃ (פ)\nWhen the Israelites heard this, the whole community of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh to make war on them.\n13\nוַיִּשְׁלְח֨וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל אֶל־בְּנֵי־רְאוּבֵ֧ן וְאֶל־בְּנֵי־גָ֛ד וְאֶל־חֲצִ֥י שֵֽׁבֶט־מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה אֶל־אֶ֣רֶץ הַגִּלְעָ֑ד אֶת־פִּינְחָ֖ס בֶּן־אֶלְעָזָ֥ר הַכֹּהֵֽן׃\nBut [first] the Israelites sent the priest Phinehas son of Eleazar to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead,\n14\nוַעֲשָׂרָ֤ה נְשִׂאִים֙ עִמּ֔וֹ נָשִׂ֨יא אֶחָ֜ד נָשִׂ֤יא אֶחָד֙ לְבֵ֣ית אָ֔ב לְכֹ֖ל מַטּ֣וֹת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְאִ֨ישׁ רֹ֧אשׁ בֵּית־אֲבוֹתָ֛ם הֵ֖מָּה לְאַלְפֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃\naccompanied by ten chieftains, one chieftain from each ancestral house of each of the tribes of Israel; they were every one of them heads of ancestral houses of the contingents of Israel.\n15\nוַיָּבֹ֜אוּ אֶל־בְּנֵי־רְאוּבֵ֧ן וְאֶל־בְּנֵי־גָ֛ד וְאֶל־חֲצִ֥י שֵֽׁבֶט־מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה אֶל־אֶ֣רֶץ הַגִּלְעָ֑ד וַיְדַבְּר֥וּ אִתָּ֖ם לֵאמֹֽר׃\nWhen they came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, they spoke to them as follows:\n16\nכֹּ֣ה אָמְר֞וּ כֹּ֣ל ׀ עֲדַ֣ת יְהוָ֗ה מָֽה־הַמַּ֤עַל הַזֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר מְעַלְתֶּם֙ בֵּאלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לָשׁ֣וּב הַיּ֔וֹם מֵאַחֲרֵ֖י יְהוָ֑ה בִּבְנֽוֹתְכֶ֤ם לָכֶם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ לִמְרָדְכֶ֥ם הַיּ֖וֹם בַּיהוָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does Rav Zevin see evidence of post-Churban editing in Vetechazena?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In HaMoadim BeHalachah, page 371, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Yosef_Zevin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Shlomo Zevin</a> endorses the idea raised by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Isaac_Halevy_Rabinowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchak Isaac HaLevy</a> that the tefillot were established before the destruction of the Second Temple. However, he takes issue with what he deems an overstatement, that aside from the Birchat Haminim, was no change <em>whatsoever</em> in the days of Yavneh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N56sU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N56sU.png\" alt=\"text from HaMoadim BeHalachah\" /></a></p>\n<p>He points out several changes in Tefillah that seem to indicate exile or destruction. Would they have said in Musaf, in Temple times, וּמִפְּנֵי חֲטָאֵינוּ גָּלִינוּ מֵאַרְצֵנוּ, \"and because of our sins we were exiled from our land\", or בְּנֵה בֵיתְךָ כְּבַתְּחִילָה וְכוֹנֵן בֵּית מִקְדָּשְׁךָ עַל מְכוֹנו, \"build your house as at first and establish your Bet Hamikdash on its place\"? It is logical that this nusach was innovated in the time of Yavneh. And even in the blessings of Shemoneh Esrei, would they have had the bracha of\nוַתֶחֱזֶינָה עֵינֵינוּ, \"and let our eyes see  (Your return to Jerusalem in Mercy)\", with its conclusion of \"who returns his Shechina to Zion\"?</p>\n<p>All of these are good evidence of post-Destruction editing. And it is convincing (to me, at least), that even this last proof, regarding וַתֶחֱזֶינָה עֵינֵינוּ, is true, in the sense that\nthe <em>point</em> of the blessing as it currently exists (starting with <em>retzei</em>), is the restoration of the Avodah, the service, such that returning the Divine Presence means with the rebuilt Beit HaMikdash. That is why it also includes וְהָשֵׁב אֶת הָעֲבוֹדָה לִדְבִיר בֵּיתֶךָ, that the service should be restored to the Beit HaMikdash.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>technically</strong>, isn't there a problem with his last proof from וַתֶחֱזֶינָה? After all, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.68b.14?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 21b</a>, we read of five differences between the First and Second Temples. One was Divine fire (though this is mitigated / interpreted in the gemara as a different level of fire). Another was the presence of the Shechina:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵלּוּ חֲמִשָּׁה דְּבָרִים שֶׁהָיוּ בֵּין מִקְדָּשׁ רִאשׁוֹן לְמִקְדָּשׁ שֵׁנִי וְאֵלּוּ הֵן אָרוֹן וְכַפּוֹרֶת וּכְרוּבִים אֵשׁ וּשְׁכִינָה וְרוּחַ הַקּוֹדֶשׁ וְאוּרִים וְתוּמִּים</p>\n<p>These are five differences between the First Temple and the Second Temple: The <em>Aron</em>/Ark, the <em>Kapores</em>/Ark covering and the <em>Keruvim</em>/Cherubs, the fire and <em>Shechinah</em>/Divine Presence, <em>Ruach HaKodesh</em>/Divine inspiration, and the <em>Urim VeTumim</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Which some commentators understand as a full withdrawal and some as a partial withdrawal.) If so, is Rav Zeven's last proof truly solid? Couldn't this blessing then have been a request, composed in Second Temple times, that the Shechina return (from its full or partial absence)?</p>\n<p>I understand that other words in the same blessing indicate otherwise (וְהָשֵׁב אֶת הָעֲבוֹדָה לִדְבִיר בֵּיתֶךָ), and that this interpretation might seem somewhat forced, but regardless, how could Rav Zevin have written this, and overlooked such an \"obvious\" point?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Indeed, one could ask such a technical question on Rav Zevin's last proof. Yet, in context, the point was that the obvious interpretation of this blessing was the asking for the rebuilding of the Temple, the resumption of sacrifices, and along with it (whether the Shechina had or had not been present before), Hashem's dwelling in Tzion.</p>\n<p>Footnote 61 can help us understand his reasoning. He writes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Vr6Qr.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Vr6Qr.png\" alt=\"footnote 61 in Moadim BeHalachah\" /></a></p>\n<p>That is, he notes historical evidence that this was indeed changed. He points us to Rashi on Berachot 11b, and on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.68b.14?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 68b, where Rashi</a> writes explicitly that in place of the blessing of וַתֶחֱזֶינָה, and the conclusion of הַמַּחֲזִיר שְׁכִינָתוֹ לְצִיּוֹן, they would say a different nusach, which was more in line with the Temple existing.</p>\n<p>That Rashi in Yoma reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל העבודה - רצה בעמך ישראל ותרצה העבודה בדביר ביתך וכו' שאותך לבדך ביראה נעבוד:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All the aforementioned difficulties in וַתֶחֱזֶינָה are obviated. Namely, it is \"let the avodah be accepted in Devir Beitecha\" as opposed to וְהָשֵׁב אֶת הָעֲבוֹדָה לִדְבִיר בֵּיתֶךָ, and no mention of longing of our eyes seeing Hashem's return.</p>\n<p>Presumably, it was this knowledge of an earlier form of the blessing, and that the current form was different, that made Rav Zevin correctly see the post-Churban implications of this blessing. The technical objection did not bother him. And he assumed people would be reading his sefer in Hebrew, or at least check the footnotes, to understand his words.</p>\n\n\n",

He lists Hillel as a seventh-generation student of Ezra:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בית דינו של עזרא הם הנקראים אנשי כנסת הגדולה והם חגי זכריה ומלאכי דניאל וחנניה ומישאל ועזריה ונחמיה בן חכליה ומרדכי בלשן וזרובבל והרבה חכמים עמהם תשלום מאה ועשרים זקנים האחרון מהם הוא שמעון הצדיק והוא היה מכלל המאה ועשרים וקיבל תורה שבעל פה מכולם והוא היה כהן גדול אחר עזרא אנטיגנוס איש סוכו ובית דינו קיבלו משמעון הצדיק ובית דינו ויוסי בן יועזר איש צרידה ויוסף בן יוחנן איש ירושלים ובית דינם קיבלו מאנטיגנוס ובית דינו ויהושע בן פרחיה ונתאי הארבלי ובית דינם קבלו מיוסי בן יועזר ויוסף בן יוחנן ובית דינם ויהודה בן טבאי ושמעון בן שטח ובית דינם קבלו מיהושע בן פרחיה ונתאי הארבלי ובית דינם שמעיה ואבטליון גרי הצדק ובית דינם קבלו מיהודה ושמעון ובית דינם הלל ושמאי ובית דינם קבלו משמעיה ואבטליון ובית דינם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably, the Talmud does not mean that Hillel was literally a student of Ezra; rather, it means that in some sense he embodied Ezra's teachings. Consider Hillel's own exhortation in Avot 1:12 to \"be of the students of Aaron\".

In the medieval period, around the time of the Spanish expulsion in 1492, many Jews in Spain converted to Christianity, including prominent Jewish figures like <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/seneor-abraham\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abraham Seneor</a> and, allegedly, Isaac Abarbanel's grandfather, <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/631-abravanel-abarbanel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Don Samuel</a>.

Are there any Teshuvot addressing this dilemma of whether to convert or not?</p>\n<p>I am aware that Rambam in his אגרת השמד encouraged the Jews who were being forced to convert to Islam to save themselves. Were there any equivalent Teshuvot by other Hakhamim defending the decision of the conversos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The history of Spanish <em>conversos</em>, from the forced conversions of 1391 until after the expulsion, is complicated and contentious. Nevertheless, while medieval rabbinic authorities broadly did not <em>defend</em> conversion to Catholicism, there are many teshuvot that deal with the practical implications of <em>conversos</em> (e.g., the status of children, marrying someone who was previously baptized, etc.). If you're asking about rationales for conversion from the very Jews who tried to retain their faith through conversion (as opposed to the majority of those who converted out of convenience/assimilation/secularism), there are various explanations.</p>\n<p>Here is one rationale, from Rabbi Marc Angel's work on Sephardic history, <em>Voices in Exile</em> (p. 46-47). As Angel explains, crypto-Jews did not have many Jewish texts or authorities to rely on during the 15th century, so it's difficult to talk about them receiving \"halakhic justification\" for their crypto-Judaism. They did, however, have the Christian Bible (which not only contained the Torah, as the \"Old Testament,\" but also books of Apocrypha), which they used for theological support:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The theory of crypto-Judaism found support in the Epistle of Jeremy, the last chapter of the [Apocryphal] Book of Barukh: \"When you see a multitude before you and behind bowing down, you shall say in your hearts: You alone are to be praised, O Lord\" (6:5-6). Conversos applied this lesson to themselves, holding that true worship of the Lord depends on one's heart, not on external actions. Converso theology also found precedent in the biblical Esther. She kept her Jewish identity secret from her husband, King Ahasuerus, conducting herself outwardly as a Persian queen, but inwardly remaining faithful to Judaism. The story had special appeal to the conversos because, after all, Esther was a heroine. She ultimately saved the Jewish people from destruction. Her crypto-Judaism was, thus, vindicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Angel goes on to detail the spectrum of opinions by medieval rabbis on how to understand the crisis of <em>conversos</em>, as well as the efforts by Sephardic communities outside of Spain and Portugal who maintained contacts with <em>conversos,</em> and actively worked to help them return as open Jews.</p>\n<p>The OP specifically asks about rabbis defending nominal conversions and crypto-Judaism. Considering the cardinal value against idolatry in Judaism, and the opportunities to leave Spain, contemporaneous responsa are overwhelmingly negative to the a priori idea of conversion (and while there are responsa that sympathize with the plight of conversos, I have yet to see any rabbinic authority defend 14th or 15th century conversion to Catholicism). Here is how historian Norman Roth summarizes the issue, in his work <em>Conversos, Inquisition, and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain</em> (p. 32):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Jewish authorities of Spain already considered the conversos to be not <em>anusim</em> but <em>meshumadim</em>, not \"forced\" converts acting under duress but complete and willful converts who were no longer part of the Jewish people, and this in the <em>fourteenth</em> century, not just in the fifteenth.</p>\n<p>One might suppose that the attacks on Jewish communities in the summer of 1391 resulted in massive conversions due to fear, like those of the First Crusade in Germany. Indeed, there is considerable evidence of mass conversion, but given the forceful reaction of the kings there was clearly no reason for \"fear,\" nor did the rabbinic authorities treat those conversion as happening under \"duress\" but, again, as complete <em>willful</em> conversion. Furthermore, those who had the opportunity to leave the country and return to Judaism did not do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And today we don't really care about this kind of <em>tamei</em> anyhow; many of my best friends are on the <em>chevra kadisha</em> and handle corpses -- everyone's <em>tamei</em> in a halachic sense, and we don't really worry about it.</p>\n<p>The question is trying to use \"tumah\" in a broader spiritual sense of \"bad things.\" That connects with the midrashic reading of <strong>this same verse</strong>, that \"venitmeitem\" refers to <em>timtum halev.</em> Thus people have occasionally gotten spooked about the horrible spiritual effects of non-kosher food, and occasionally forgotten that we do mitzvos because God commanded them. And God also says there is such thing as repentance, and also such thing as nullification! (If one drop of Campbell's chicken soup falls into a hundred gallons of water, the water is kosher. If halacha -- i.e. the will of God -- says it is kosher, then you don't have to -- and in fact, should not -- worry about it messing up your soul!)</p>\n<p>With that lesson in mind, in essence your question does in fact therefore translate into <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/119351/tikkun-for-timtum-halev\"><em>the question about timtum halev</em></a>, and the answer there said it best: if in Temple times it could be repaired with a standard animal sacrifice, then repentance is the medicine here.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, during his tenure as High Priest, the strip of crimson wool that was tied to the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel turned white, indicating that the sins of the people had been forgiven, as it is written: “Though your sins be as crimson, they shall be white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18). From then onward, it sometimes turned white and sometimes it did not turn white. Furthermore, the western lamp of the candelabrum would burn continuously as a sign that God’s presence rested upon the nation. From then onward, it sometimes burned and sometimes it went out. And during the tenure of Shimon HaTzaddik, the fire on the arrangement of wood on the altar kept going strongly, perpetually by itself, such that the priests did not need to bring additional wood to the arrangement on a daily basis, except for the two logs that were brought in order to fulfill the mitzva of placing wood upon the arrangement.

Enosh himself was one of those who erred.\nTheir mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.\nAfter conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.\nThis was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there is no other god except for this star.\nThis message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10: 7-8): \"Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood; \" i.e., all know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this emptiness as Your will\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following statement from the Talmud Bavli should be a Maimonides's source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"R.

Is there any reason to be machmir and not eat this mustard, given that (I imagine) the reasons not to eat kitniyot dont apply here, since I can see the actual plant and it is going from the plant straight into the mouth without any chametz in sight. Or is there a \"lo plug\", and it would be forbidden in any case.</p>\n<p>Stated otherwise: If the conditions for kitniyot clearly do not apply and can be verified as such i.e. my immediate personal experience standing in front of a wild mustard plant, is kitniyot still prohibited for this situation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The prohibition on kitniyot applies regardless. For example, if you were 100% sure that you had a mustard plant, picked it yourself, and then cooked it, the prohibition would obtain.</p>\n<p>However, in terms of your specific case of eating the dry raw mustard: as far as I understand it, the majority Ashkenazi position is that we don't treat kitniyot more stringently than the five grains. Since we are allowed to eat grains that haven't come into contact with water, so too can we eat kitniyot that haven't come into contact with water.</p>\n<p>According to a minority position, we treat kitniyot more stringently, forbidding their consumption even without contact with water. This is because there's no real reason to distinguish dry from wet with kitniyot (since they don't rise), and they don't want people to confuse kitniyot for the actual five grains.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-09-06/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halakha</a> for sources.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Someone who doesn't sell chametz gamur, yet accidentally put it with things to be sold",
    "content": "# Someone who doesn't sell chametz gamur, yet accidentally put it with things to be sold\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The following is purely hypothetical (;-)).</p>\n<p>Someone has the custom to not sell <em>chametz gamur</em> before Pesach, ie. real <em>chametz</em> items like cakes, cookies, bread, etc. They only sell things that might contain <em>chametz</em>, or things that aren't \"<em>Pesadik</em>\". As such, when they arrange the sale to the non-Jew, they didn't have in mind to sell any <em>chametz gamur</em>. Instead, the person's intent was to either consume, or seek out and destroy all <em>chametz gamur</em> before Pesach.</p>\n<p>What would be the law if, by some unfortunate mix-up, they put all their <em>chametz gamur</em> items in their box of \"<em>chametz</em>\" items to be sold to the non-Jew. They realize their mistake on Pesach. Were these items included in the sale? I could look at this in two ways. It's basically as if they had explicit intent not to sell these items, as they were supposed to go in the garbage/fire and not in the box with the other things. They also never sell these items to a non-Jew. On the other hand, maybe you could say that had the person known they had <em>chametz</em> in their possession on Pesach, even <em>chametz gamur</em>, they would have sold it before Pesach. Or maybe it depends on how the sale is formulated? I believe it usually says <strong>any <em>chametz</em> in my possession</strong>. Although, you would still need intent to sell for it to actually take effect.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps a more extreme example of this is when <em>erev Pesach</em> falls on Shabbos, so the person set aside two pieces of pita to eat during the Shabbos meal, before the prohibition of eating <em>chametz</em> kicks in. I believe in these instances the sale is conducted before Shabbos. What would be the law if these pitas went missing, and the person in the end didn't consume them on Shabbos. On Pesach they realize that they ended up in the bag in fridge with all the \"<em>chametz</em>\" items that were sold to the non-Jew. Were these pitas also sold? Or since the person had explicit intent before Shabbos to eat them on Shabbos, it's clear they weren't supposed to be sold. Yet again, maybe you can say that had they known they would have gone missing, they would have wanted to sell them.</p>\n<p>Do the <em>poskim</em> discuss such cases?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I think the sale is meant to cover any <em>chametz</em> that somehow was missed during the search-and-destroy. I would think that this would include <em>chametz gamur</em>, as a safety measure, even for those who normally don't knowingly sell <em>chametz gamur</em>. My only concern is this case is different, as these items <strong>were meant to be destroyed</strong>, yet got mixed up and put in the wrong box.</p>\n\n\n",

Its oldest attestation appears in the Fourth Book of Ezra, whose final redaction is dated to ca. 100 C.E.

He correctly believed that putting heavy labor, and taskmasters, upon them, would make it <em>less</em> likely, rather than more likely, that they revolt.</p>\n<p>The idea would seem to be that they were subjugated, restricted, and demoralized. Questions of the type of \"why didn't X happen\", which are alternate reality questions, are not really otherwise answerable.</p>\n<p>However, we can look further to what happened in the narrative when a possible revolt did occur. When Moshe brought them the signs, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9867\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 6:9</a>, we are told:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר משֶׁ֛ה כֵּ֖ן אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־משֶׁ֔ה מִקֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ וּמֵֽעֲבֹדָ֖ה קָשָֽׁה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel, but they did not hearken to Moses because of [their] shortness of breath and because of [their] hard labor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Pharaoh's program of demoralization via hard labor was working, to prevent any revolt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On a simple level, if we follow the Biblical narrative, the Hebrews were \"commanded\" to submit to Egyptians to fulfill the prophecy and they waited for a miraculous redemption.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And He said to Abram, “Know well that your offspring shall be strangers in a land not theirs, and they shall be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years;\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.15.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis.15.13</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Shall be enslaved\" can be interpreted as a one-time commandment (as \"you shall eat Matzah on Pesach\") and failure to do that would be interpreted as transgressing God's Mitzvah and ruining God's plans.</p>\n<p>On a Remez level, the Rabbis teach that it was necessary for inheriting the Promised land. Suffering is commonly seen in Judaism as refinement and purification of the earthly physical existence to elevate a person to higher spiritual levels worthy of \"inheriting the Land\". Rebelling would undermine this process and prevent them from entering \"the Holy Land\", as they wouldn't be freed/liberated from their physical bad inclinations.</p>\n<p>In general, this motif of viewing personal and national suffering (sometimes seen as a sacrifice/martyrdom) as an essential part of the redemption process is central to Judaism and is maintained in prophets and writings.</p>\n<p>Since the terrible failure of the Jewish revolts at the beginning of the first century, which led to the destruction of the Temple and great losses in the lives of the Jews, this approach became the leading method of coping with oppression, persecution, and exiles of the Jews in the last 1500 years. This was codified in the Talmud in the form of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Three Oaths</a>\", where the second one states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Two, <strong>the Holy One adjured Israel not to rebel against the nations of the world</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This narrative is repeated in the prayer, the Kedusha for Shabbos or Yom Tov the Chazan says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"הֵן גָּאַלְתִּי אֶתְכֶם אַחֲרִית כְּרֵאשִׁית לִהְיוֹת לָכֶם לֵאלֹהִים\" - \"I, God, will redeem you at long last in the way I did before to become your God\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in theory, the Jewish people should sit and wait for the miraculous redemption in the figure of the Messiah, and all suffering is justified as God's mercy to purify us and to inherit us even bigger parts of the world to come. This was the official Jewish Orthodox position toward the catastrophe and the establishment of the Jewish state.</p>\n<p>Worthy to mention that some anti-zionist Ultra-Orthodox factions, that base themselves on the aforementioned tradition, still prefer the Palestinian terror to Israeli prosperity, as fighting oppression (in that view) just pushes the final redemption off instead of bringing it closer.</p>\n\n\n",

[...] y<strong>ou should be lavish with meat, wine and\nsweets</strong>, according to your means.</p>\n<p>Every man is obligated to gladden the hearts of his wife, his\nchildren, and all who are dependent on him, in a way suitable for each\n[...] to the men, meat and wine. <strong>It is the custom to serve a greater\nvariety of foods on Yom Tov than on Shabbos</strong>, because with regard to\nYom Tov, the Torah mentions \"rejoicing,\" but it is not mentioned with\nregard to Shabbos.</p>\n<p>Even though eating and drinking on festivals is a positive\ncommandment, <strong>you should not spend all day eating and drinking</strong> [...]</p>\n<p><strong>And when you eat and drink, it is your duty to provide also for the\norphan, the widow and other needy people</strong> [...]</p>\n<p>When a person eats and drinks, and rejoices on the festival, <strong>he should\nnot overindulge in drinking wine</strong>, in laughter and lightheadedness,\nthinking that the more he indulges, the greater will be the mitzvah of\nrejoicing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>KSA doesn't explicitly address meals on Chol Hamoed. R Aharon E. Marcus, in his excellent Halacha 24/7/12, writes (p. 264)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to most Poskim, <strong>you should have a <em>reviit</em> or wine and a\n<em>kezayit</em> of meat every single day of Yom Tov, including Chol Hamoed</strong>. R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach says that grape juice and poultry qualify as\nmeat and wine, but R Moshe Feinstein and R Eliashiv say that you\nshould consume alcoholic wine and beef.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly R Dovid Zucker and R Moshe Francis in their <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Products/CHOH.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">book on the laws of Chol Hamoed</a> p. 21 write</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] each person should rejoice in the manner most compatible with\nhis nature. Thus [on Chol Hamoed] according to many authorities, <strong>a man should drink a <em>reviis</em> of wine daily</strong> (some authorities allow grape juice instead of wine). It is also preferable to <strong>eat a <em>kzayis</em> of\nmeat daily</strong> [and it is even permitted for women on their\n<em>mikve</em> day] (see there and appendix for sources)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/the-meals-of-chol-hamoed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the views of Shulchan Aruch HaRav.</p>\n\n\n",

Often, the overlap between those who get it right and those who enthusiastically edit Wikipedia is small. In this case, you are interpreting the word choice of a secondary source, that is, what some random Wikipedia editor understood of the underlying primary source in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 15b</a>, especially in your question about \"most rabbis\". The account in Wikipedia is somewhat botched, even before your attempt to interpret it (e.g. in omitting the \"exception\" even according to the standard version of the text).</p>\n<p>The five rabbis in that primary source, a brayta (Tannaitic unit of teaching) on Bava Batra 15b, don't explicitly speak of whether Iyov was Jewish or gentile, or whether he was a prophet. Rather, they each weigh in with a position of when Iyov lived. The Talmud, or to be more specific, the anonymous narrative voice of the Talmud (called the setama degemara), a stratum composed many centuries later, makes this deduction that \"these tannaim necessarily considered Job an Israelite\", with the exception of the one Tanna who placed Iyov fairly early.</p>\n<p>The basis of this deduction is logical, and rests on two premises, namely that after a certain time, Divine inspiration or prophecy would not rest on a gentile, and secondly, that Iyov was such a person who was privy to such prophecy, presumably based on verses such as <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2740.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 40:1</a>, \"Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said...\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Wikipedia statement regarding the Talmudic text of \"R. Chananel ben Chushiel\" is a reference to Rabbenu Chananel. He version is cited in a comment by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15b.7?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafists</a> on the page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בפירוש רבינו חננאל גרס כולהו תנאי ואמוראי מודו דאיוב ישראל היה ולר\"י נראה דל\"ג ואמוראי דרבא ע\"כ סבר לעיל דלאו מישראל הוה דקאמר לעיל הכי אמר להן משה למרגלים ישנו לאותו אדם ששנותיו כעץ כו':</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>where he includes not just Tannaim (those in the brayta) but also Amoraim (later generations of scholars), as also maintained that Iyov was Jewish. Tosafot cites the R\"i who says that this is an incorrect version, because one of the Amoraim earlier in the gemara in question, Rava, considered Iyov a gentile.</p>\n<p>However, in terms of your question,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Was he considered an Israelite, or a Gentile, according to the opinion of <strong>most rabbis</strong>?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>you might be reading too much into the wording of the Wikipedia editor. When explaining the meaning of \"all the Tannaim\", Rashi there explains it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכולהו הני תנאי כו' - מסקנא דתירוצא הוא דתריץ לעיל תנאי היא ההוא מתניתא דלעיל ס\"ל עובד כוכבים הוה והני תנאי דהך מתניתא כולהו סבירא להו דישראל הוה בר מיש אומרים דאמרי בימי יעקב הוה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, this is a Tannaitic dispute, that one Tannaitic source above maintains that he was a gentile, while these Tannaim of this particular brayta maintain that he was a Jew.</p>\n<p>For reference, there were approximately 3000 rabbis among the Tannaim and Amoraim. Here, we are counting independently listed opinions, which could be counted on two hands. That does not tell us what \"most rabbis\" of these 3000 held, about him being Jewish or gentile.</p>\n<p>It also does not tell us <em>explicitly</em> as to whether they deemed him merely righteous man or a prophet, in terms of your first question. (A better practice in asking questions here is separating multiple questions into separate posts, since each can get complicated, and people might be able to answer one but not the other.) Rather, this is the assumption of the anonymous voice of the Talmud, that is assuming that all these Tannaim accepted that Iyov received some Divine message, again presumably based on the verse, and then extrapolating on that basis.</p>\n<p>However, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, we see that <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2005/01/iyyov-lo-haya-velo-nivraatid-lihyot.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</a>, despite Iyov existing as a real person in the days of Abraham (and by extension, probably also not being Jewish), the account in the Book of Iyov of his sufferings and the ensuing conversations (which would presumably include the divine revelation) did not actually occur. Rather, it is Wisdom Literature, exploring the problem of why bad things happen to good people, and this fictional setup was ascribed to this real historical person because he was a such a good person that he would have withstood the tests and tribulations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Talmud in Tractate Megillah 14a says there were 48 Jewish prophets who are part of the Bible. While the Talmud does not list them, the commentaries Rashi and Rabbeinu Chananel do. Neither has Job in their list, even though Rashi says he can only find 46 prophets and is missing two.</p>\n<p>In relation to your earlier question, the non-Jewish prophets ended in the time of Moses. The opinions in Bava Batra boil down to this: If Job lived during Moses' time or earlier, he was non-Jewish. If he was Jewish, he lived after Moses.</p>\n<p>I don't think there is a consensus as to which option is more correct, but there is no possibility that he was a prophet to the Jews and a non-Jew at the same time. Even if he was Jewish, he is not listed as one of the main prophets of our history.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Psalm 82, G.d-Elyon",
    "content": "# Psalm 82, G.d-Elyon\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to have an explanation of Psalm 82. According to an absurd interpretation, G.d and Elyon are different individuals. In the Psalm it would be written that \"G.d resides in the assembly of El\". Here, now I come to the question. In Hebrew the words are baʿădat-ʾēl.</p>\n<p>I know it must be translated as \"divine-assembly\". But an author instead explains disputing this translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>«The phrase\" assembly of 'Ȇl \"(' ăḏaṯ - 'ȇl) is formed from the\nsingular feminine (' ăḏaṯ -) + the singular masculine noun ('ȇl). The\nnoun (' ăḏaṯ -) is in a constructive state with the noun ('ȇl), the\nlatter in an absolute state. For those who do not remember it, the\nconstruct state of Hebrew grammar is the complement of specification\nrendered with \"of\". The first noun is said in construct state or\nregent name, the second noun is said to be in an absolute state or\nright name. The right name ('ȇl) is here a proper name, and like all\nproper names they do not take the article because they are\nself-determined: the Semitic writer is referring to the supreme power\nof Ugarit and not to any power. The determination of the right name\n('ȇl) also determines the ruling name (' ăḏaṯ -), as the Hebrew\ngrammar dictates, so the translation is \"the assembly of 'Ȇl\" and not,\n\" divine assembly \".»</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is incorrect.If what this author says about the construct is true, then why, for example, in Genesis 31,13; 46: 3 the Torah says <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9C&tab=text&tpathFilters=Tanakh&tvar=1&tsort=chronological&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">האל</a> (hāʾēl) that is preceded by the article?</p>\n<p>Basically, how do you think of that author's explanation of the construct state above?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The grammatical point is incorrect. The construct mustn't always be translated as indicating possession. We commonly have, for instance, הַר קָדְשׁוֹ <em>his holy mountain</em> (Psalms 99:9), not <em>mountain belonging to his holiness</em>. But with respect to the word אֵל specifically, there is even more ambiguity, since God's name is habitually used in construct state to mean something other than a personal name. הַרְרֵי אֵל <em>the mighty mountains</em> (Psalms 36:7), אַרְזֵי אֵל <em>the mighty cedars</em> (Psalms 80:11), חֶרְדַּת אֱלֹהִים <em>an awful terror</em> (1 Samuel 14:15). See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.36.7?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radak to Psalms 36:7</a> for more examples not in construct state. So grammatical constraints alone have no bearing on whether to translate \"divine assembly\" or \"assembly of El.\" Both interpretations are grammatical.</p>\n<p>And again, El is the name of the Canaanite deity, but also the name of the God of Israel, אֵל אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל (Genesis 33:20), among the other meanings of the word. It's an interesting question whether the Israelites considered their El to be identical with the Canaanite El, but it's irrelevant to interpretation here. If they were considered to be two separate deities, a psalm by an Israelite author referring to \"El\" obviously means El of the Israelites, just as a psalm by a Canaanite author would obviously refer to El of the Canaanites. But an ambiguous name is not a grammatical problem that can be solved by grammatical means. We can still ask who the words אֱ‍לֹהִים and אֵל are referring to throughout this psalm, but Hebrew grammar has little to contribute to this question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am an Italian Noahide; I am not an expert in Hebrew and I do not know this presumed compatriot of mine named Maghen David, but I point out that the translation he proposed is radically contrary to the millennial exegesis of the masters of Israel.</p>\n<p>I would also like to add that even the translation of 'adat el with \"divine assembly\" seems to me somewhat questionable, precisely on the basis of the Midrashic tradition.\nI am of the opinion that the correct translation is \"assembly of mighty men\", reading \"el\" as a group singular or collective noun for \"elim\", a phenomenon that an Israeli friend of mine told me is quite common in Hebrew.</p>\n<p>In support of the aforementioned hermeneutics we can recall the Midrash.</p>\n<p>In Pirke Avot 3.6 it is written:</p>\n<p><em>Rabbi Halafta of Kefar Hanania said: when ten sit together and occupy themselves with Torah, the Shechinah abides among them, as it is said: \"the Almighty stands in the 'adat el\"</em></p>\n<p>The 'adat el is therefore the assembly composed of those who dedicate themselves to the study of the Torah, and this hermeneutic is confirmed by the Aramaic Targum of the Psalms, which in fact translates 'adal el as \"assembly of the pious scholars who are powerful in their Torah scholarship ”, as confirmed to me by Rav Reuven Lauffer in a private correspondence.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Climate and growing season in Iron Age Israel and Judah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Jan A Wagenaar, <em>Origin and Transformation of the Ancient Israelite Festival Calendar</em>, Harrassowitz Verlag, Wiesbaden 2005, proposes that the Feast of Unleavened Bread was originally in the month of Iyar, not Nisan.  He argues this by pointing out that the feast was originally at the time of the barley harvest (Exodus 9:31-32) and not assigned to a fixed date in the calendar.  He asserts, citing D.C. Hopkins, <em>The Highlands of Canaan: Agricultural Life in the Early Iron Age</em>, SWBAS, Sheffield, 1985, that the climate of Iron Age Palestine is about the same as today’s.  Then he notes that the barley harvest in the lowlands of what is now Israel begins at the beginning of May, and later in the highlands.  For this he cites a study of Palestinian agriculture from the first half of the 20th century, G. Dolman, <em>Arbeit und Sitte in Palästina</em>, Gutersloh, 1928-1942.  He quotes from Dolman 4 dates for the beginning of the barley harvest near Jerusalem:  June 3rd, 1911, May 21 1913, May 16th 1921, and May 24th 1925.  This is too late to fall consistently in the Babylonian month of Nisanu which in the time of Artaxerxes I (reigned 464 BCE-424 BCE) began as early as March 26th, though as late as April 23rd. (R.A. Parker and W.H. Dubber stein, <em>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C. - A.D. 75</em>, Brown University Press, 1956).</p>\n<p>The hypothesis that the Feast of Unleavened Bread could not have fallen always in Nisan in the late Iron Age depends on the proposition that the climate of modern Israel is the same as in the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah.  Does anyone have access to climatological studies that would refute or confirm this?  I found <a href=\"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/158454/1/Farber_Wright_Eighth_Century.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this study</a> on-line, in which one author holds that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the climate of the eastern Mediterranean generally has fluctuated in a fairly narrow range since the latter half of the EB IV.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which would support Wagenaar’s hypothesis.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I won't answer the question as stated. Instead I will address one premise of the question, which is actually very common with this type of question.</p>\n<p>The question assumes that Pesach is supposed to be at the time of the regular barley harvest. This come from a mistaken understanding of the Torah.</p>\n<p>The connection between Pesach and the barley harvest is from the Korban haOmer, which is described as the \"first of your harvest.\" This offering is described in Leviticus 2:14, according to Rashi and Toras Kohanim. There it says that the barley must be roasted, according to Rashi, because it is still moist and אביב, just ripening, and if it weren't roasted it could not be ground.</p>\n<p>This shows that the Omer offering is not brought at the normal time of the barley harvest, but before the barley is fully ripened and dry. This stage is reached today in late March, the time when Pesach is celebrated, even in the highlands.</p>\n<p>We see here that when one has a correct understanding of the Torah according to Rabbinic tradition, there is no conflict between Torah and Science. This answers many, many questions of this type.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This Wagenaar fellow seems to be ignorant of a basic fact about the Jewish calendar: the month of Nissan is determined by when Passover will fall out. That is, the Rabbis waited for the signs of spring, and then declared the month of Nissan. If there were signs the spring was delayed, they would add a second month of Adar before Nissan so that Passover and Nissan would be in the spring. Because the Jewish calendar has a flex month that in those days was determined on a yearly basis, even if Wagenaar is 100% right about the agricultural data, that just means that in those days they observed Nissan a month later. Over time as the seasons shifted, the calendar could shift with it.</p>\n\n\n",

[Therefore, they referred to the hare only by one of its characteristic features.] [Megillah 9b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How would the king even know that the Torah had the word \"Arnevet\" in it?

However, I think I have a theory now about that, which may also answer the OP.</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Aristeas\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Letter of Aristeas</a>, considered by academics the prime source of the story of the making of the Targum (sadly academics often are quick to write off Chazalic sources...), states that the Ptolemy of the Targum was Ptolemy II Philadelphus (in one place <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Letter_of_Aristeas.13?vhe=The_Letter_of_Aristeas_--_wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentions</a> Ptolemy son of Lagus, and when referring to the king, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Letter_of_Aristeas.41?vhe=The_Letter_of_Aristeas_--_wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> about Ptolemy, husband of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arsinoe his sister</a> - this was Ptolemy II), the Chazalic sources never state which one it was, so per p'shat - it could either be Ptolemy I or Ptolemy II.</p>\n<p>However, neither of the Ptolemys had any wife or consort named \"lagína\" or \"lagoudína\", the feminine forms of the Greek word for \"hare\" - \"lagós\" (per <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%8C%CF%82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wiktionary</a>).</p>\n<p>As stated by @mbloch, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ptolemy I</a>'s father was named \"Lagus\", which is very similar to the Greek word for hare, \"lagós\". His mother was named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_of_Macedon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arsinoe</a>.</p>\n<p>And as it turns out, there are three Tannaic sources that have slightly different versions of this tale:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.12b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Megillah 12b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואת הארנבת את צעירת הרגלים <strong>אמו</strong> של תלמי המלך ארנתא הוות שמה\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"and the [female] hare - and the hairy of legs the <strong>mother</strong> of King Ptolemy was named Arneta.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Vayikra_Rabbah.13.5?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabbah 13:5</a> (also appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.536.1?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni 536</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וְאֶת הָאַרְנֶבֶת, זוֹ יָוָן, <strong>אִמּוֹ</strong> שֶׁל תַּלְמַי אַרְנֶבֶת שְׁמָהּ.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"and the [female] hare, that's Greece, the <strong>mother</strong> of Ptolemy was named Arnevet [hare].\"</p>\n<p>It's entirely possible that Arsinoe, wife of Lagus, had been nicknamed \"lagína\" or \"lagoudína\" or something similar after her husband. Per this, it seems that according to p'shat, the king of the Targum was actually Ptolemy I. However, one could also say that when Chazal say \"mother of Ptolemy\", they mean figuratively: \"mother of the lineage of Ptolemy\" or \"mother of the dynasty of Ptolemy\".<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, as @mbloch pointed out, to call the mother of the king or of the dynasty an impure animal - and with no less than a nickname that might have had negative connotations (being that Lagus doesn't literally mean rabbit - see <a href=\"https://scriptaclassica.org/index.php/sci/article/download/4167/3663\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pg. 79) - would have seemed mocking on the part of the Jews, hence the need for the change. Therefore, it seems that there was only a slight distortion/scribal error in the Bavli's version (although admittedly no MS version on the Genizah's site can back me up on this...) - from mother to wife.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Both identifications have merit because both are descendants of Arsinoe wife of Lagus, and per calculations by Dr. Chaim Chefetz in his essay \"The High Priests In The Beginning of the Second Temple Era\", the High Priest during the end of Ptolemy I's reign and the beginning of Ptolemy II's reign was Rabbi Elazar ben Charsom, identified with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Letter_of_Aristeas.1?vhe=The_Letter_of_Aristeas_--_wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elazar the High Priest in the Letter</a> (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/120551/the-rabbis-of-the-septuagint/121508#121508\">here</a>).

It is clear from there that the bracha goes on the specific food I am planning on eating. There is a machlokes regarding the rest of the food, as mentioned there.</p>\n<p>We also see from Y.D. 19, regarding the laws of making the bracha over shechita, that the halachos are basically similar and we learn the halachos of blessing over food from blessings over mitzvos and vice versa.</p>\n<p>It's also assumed that the one making the bracha will be eating from that upon which he is making the bracha. If he is exempting others, however, they do not need to eat from his item.\nThis is clear from Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.167.15?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 167:15</a>. If one person is making hamotzei for multiple people, and they are all planning on eating from his bread, then he needs to eat first. But if they all have their own bread, and he is just exempting them in the bracha, then they can eat after he blesses even before he himself eats from his bread. There is no obligation for them to eat from his bread, though some say it is meritorious.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question eating a kezayis, look at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.475.1?lang=he&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 475:1</a> with the Mishna Berurah. There's a mitzvah to eat a kezayis of matzah since the mitzvah is \"to eat\" matza, and the minimum quantity of \"eating\" with halachic significance is a kezayis. The M.B. there points out that technically, the bracha of hamotzi only requires a small little bit. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.475.1?lang=bi&with=Beur%20HaGra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beur HaGra</a> points out that according to some opinions, eating both quantities from the same matzah would violate the principle of \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.102b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ein Osim Mitzvos Chavilos Chavilos</a>\", we don't want to use the same item to fulfill multiple obligations simultaneously. Although it is not clear that the principle would apply here, we use multiple matzos to avoid the controversy.</p>\n<p>However, we have a further doubt regarding which matzah to use for which mitzvah. We know that we take two matzos, the top whole matzah and the middle broken matzah (the bottom matzah is only for lechem mishna purposes and doesn't matter for this.) One matzah is for the mitzvah of eating matza (which requires a kezayis) and the other is for hamotzei (and only requires a bit). But since there's a machlokes which matza is for which purpose, it's proper to have a kezayis from each matza to fulfill both opinions.\n(Strictly speaking, it's only obligatory to have a kezayis from the middle matzah, since the halacha follows the opinion that the middle matza is for the mitzva).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rabbi Abraham of Viterbo challenged Maimonides?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apparently Rabbi Abraham of Viterbo in the third essay of Sefer Emunat Chachamim challenged Maimonides regarding his claim that the Torah cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Could someone post an excerpt of what he said?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I have previously cited this view of R. Abraham of Viterbo, with a link to the page in the book where it appears, in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101602/did-rabbi-joseph-albo-say-the-mitzvoth-will-be-abolished/104442#104442\">this answer</a>. The following is my translation of the relevant passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And behold [Maimonides] of blessed memory built a high wall with the Thirteen Fundamentals, without which, in his opinion, one cannot be a Jew. And he forced that anyone who denies one of them is a sectarian. But it is like a  falling breach, for he of blessed memory decreed in the Fourth Fundamental that all who are called by the name of Israel must believe that the Torah of Moses will never change. And it is possible that the matter could be as he has said with regard to the eternity of the Torah, but that which he decreed that whosoever does not believe this is not a Jew, is not true. And I don’t know why or whence he got [this idea]. And we don’t find this idea in the Talmud or Midrashim at all, and his fundamental is not true. For on the contrary, according to what is found in the Talmud it was forbidden for Adam the first [man] to eat living beings — it says “from all the fruits of the garden thou mayest eat” — yet afterwards it was permitted to Noah [when it says] “like the grass of the field I have given all to you”. And so it says in the Talmud: “like the grass which I permitted to Adam the first [man] I have permitted to you all eating of living beings”.</p>\n<p>He also allowed them to eat the sciatic nerve, but forbade it to Jacob. And Noah and Abraham brought sacrifices outside of Israel,  and Jacob was allowed to marry two sisters, though afterwards this was forbidden to Israel in the Torah of Moses.</p>\n<p>And what will [Maimonides] say?! For everything is good and proper according to the time, but when the times change the law changes [as well]. And this does not constitute regret [on God’s part] at all, for it is possible that at one time a certain approach works, but after years and on account of the time a different approach works.</p>\n<p>And given that God’s Torah that was given to our holy ancestors before the giving of the [regular] Torah changed many times, why does [Maimonides] definitively decree that the Torah of Moses will never change? And if Moses, or another prophet of equal stature in the work of God, arises and tells is that the Torah is revised in full or in part, and brings us to Mt. Sinai or another place according to what God decrees, and sounds His voice with miracles and wonders, with noise and trembling, and gives is another Torah from the hand of God, why should we not believe him and not accept his words?</p>\n<p>And [Maimonides] of blessed memory adds further that if a man — whether of the nations or of Israel — gets up and performs a sign or a wonder and says that God sent him to add a commandment or subtract a commandment or to explain a commandment in a way which we did not hear from Moses, or if he says that the commandments in which Israel was commanded are not eternal and for all generations but they were commandments of the moment, he is a false prophet since he comes to contradict the prophecy of Moses and his death is via strangulation. These are his words. But this is not true, and it has no root or branch in the Talmud.</p>\n<p>And R. Joseph Karo as well in his book Kessef Mishneh made himself as if he did not know and could not find his source. And the verse that he of blessed memory brings — \"and all of this commandment  thou shalt not add to it nor subtract from it\" — is to forbid to add or subtract on our own, like those who say \"what prohibition is there in sha'atnez?\" and the like, who erase the words of God from their evil heart and mind. And this is clear.</p>\n<p>Also that which he brought as a support for his words from the verse \"[God] is not a man that He should falsify\" is not a proof at all for we have already said that because the Torah is applicable among men, who are physical and corporeal, it is possible that today one thing works for them but tomorrow another thing is better and works for them, new with the changing of the air and the climate. And this does not constitute regret, as we have said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Bereishit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמשכילים יזהירו כזהר הרקיע ומצדיקי הרבים כככבים לעולם ועד (דניאל יב ג)<br>\n\"And they who are wise (mSKL) shall shine (yZHyRu) like the brightness (ZHR) of the firmament (RKIA), and they who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever\" (Dan. 12:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The name of the book \"Zohar\" is from there BTW.

The phrase: \"The two great luminaries\" indicates that the two great luminaries, (which are Zeir Anpin and his Female principle) were united at first. This is the secret of the full name Yud Hei Vav Hei - Elohim, which although not openly revealed can be surmised. So the \"two great luminaries\" appear in a full name, even though the name Elohim shines only in a concealed way. The word \"great\" means that Zeir Anpin and his Female principle grew in greatness by this name as equals, so much so that they were called by the name that unites everything together, which is Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi. Zeir Anpin received his greatness from the right one, his Female principle from the left one. In such a way, they are referred to as \"the two great luminaries.\" These are the most supernal names that precede the thirteen attributes of Mercy. The names Mem-Tzadi-Pe- Tzadi Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi are called \"great,\" because they became great and ascended, since they are supernal and derive from the secret of above. They benefit the world, as the worlds' existence depends on them. Similarly, the two luminaries that appear in the verse, which are Zeir Anpin and his Female principle, both rose as one, in one greatness.\n<br>The moon was not at ease with the sun because she felt embarrassed before it. The moon said to the sun: \"Where do you feed your flock? Why do you make your flock to rest at noon?\" (Shir Hashirim 1:7). This is as if to say: How can a tiny candle shine in the middle of the day? \"Why should I be like one who cloaks himself?\" (Ibid.) That is: how can I remain in shame? Then she lowered herself to be head of the lower beings, as it is written: \"Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock\" (Ibid. 8). Thus, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to her, 'Go and diminish yourself.'\n<br>From then on, she had no light of her own. She had only the light she received from the sun. At first, they were united as one on the same level, but she later lowered herself from all of its grades. This means that it lost all her grades and emerged from the world of Atzilut. Although she is the head of the lower worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, she is nevertheless considered to have lost all her grades, as in principle a woman has no significance unless she is together with her husband.\n...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's much more in Zohar and TZ and the other Sifrei Kodesh.

And in this similitude do the stars and mazals borrow from one another, and angels one from antoher, and the clue of the thing Umqablin dein min-dein, so doth the Shekhinah which is the SYHRA QDYSA borrow from Kudsha Brikh Hu, and receiveth from Him. As it says of her Ki SMS u'magen H' Elhym. And so did Yehoshua receive from Moshe, as they've established Pnei Moshe k'pnei ChMA upnei Yehoshua k'pnei LBNH.

The root of the question is: Do we say that when I make a bracha, it goes on all the food I am going to eat? Or does it really only go on the food I am holding and intending to eat first, and the rest of the food only is \"dragged along\" with the first food?</p>\n<p>This is discussed in Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.206.6?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 206:6</a>) and the commentaries.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berurah and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.206.6?lang=he&with=Biur%20Halacha&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beur Halacha</a> explain that there are three opinions in the rishonim, all of which are brought by some poskim:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Tosfos and Rosh assume that the bracha only goes the item being held, while all the rest of the almonds are only \"dragged along\" and included with the first one. So if the first one gets lost, one must make a new bracha before eating from the other ones. This is true even though they were all in front of the person while he made the bracha! This is how the Mechaber (R' Yosef Karo) rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Kol Bo in the name of Rabbeinu Tam, Maharil, Abudarham and other make a distinction on what sort of intention you have. If you had explicit intention to cover the other fruit, then we say your bracha was intented on those ones as well. So you could eat the rest of the almonds even though the first one was lost. This opinion holds that if the first one was not lost, and you in fact ate the first almond, then you can eat the rest of the almonds even if you only had \"stam daas\" (i.e. you didn't specifically think about eating the rest, but if was a possibility). In this case, these opinions would agree that the rest of the fruit would be \"dragged along\" with the first almond. This is accepted as halacha by the Rama (R' Moshe Isserles). These opinions only differ with the first opinion regarding whether it's possible to expressively include multiple fruits with your intention, or whether we always only \"drag along\" the other fruits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Raavad and R' Gershon ben Shlomo add an additional layer- even if a person has \"stam daas\", whatever is in front of him at the time of the bracha is included in his intention. The \"stam daas\" only applies to food which wasn't in front of him when he made the bracha, but he might have gotten (i.e. he has more almonds elsewhere which he could eat.) Those foods are \"dragged along\". But whatever he has in front on himself will always be included, unless he explicitely excludes them (\"I am planning on not eating these almonds\") The Beur Halacha says that the Mabit held this way.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The conclusion of the Beur Halacha is that safek brachos lehakel, since there's a doubt about what the halacha is, we would not go back and make a new bracha. So if you have almonds in front of you, and the one you held while making the bracha got lost, you would just take a new almond from the pile and eat it with no new bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

It does not make sense to make a bracha for another bracha. Like we see by <strong>bircas hamazon which is positive commandment and there is no bracha beforehand.

He writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אדני השדה. חיה הגדלה בשדות, וכמין חבל גדול יוצא מן הארץ שגדלה בו אותה חיה, ושמה ידוע, והוא ידעוני הכתוב בתורה, ומחובר בטבורו באותו חבל היוצא מן הארץ, וצורתו צורת אדם בפרצוף וידים ורגלים ואין כל בריה רשאה לקרב אליו כי הוא הורג וטורף כל הקרב אליו. וכשרוצים לצוד אותו מורים בחצים בחבל עד שנפסק וצועק בקול מר ומת מיד, ואליו רמז באיוב כי עם אבני השדה בריתך</p>\n<p>Adnei HaTzadeh - It was a large wild animal in the fields and a type of large cord goes out from the ground and into the creature <strong>and its name is the Yaduah</strong> - and this is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.31?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Leviticus.19.31.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'Yidoni'</a><sup>1</sup> that the Torah writes about. And it is connected by the navel by the same cord that comes out the ground, and its shape is a human form in the face and hands and feet, and no creature can draw near to it because it kills and tears apart all those who approach it. And when they want to hunt it, they have to fire arrows at the cord until it severs and cries out a bitter voice and dies immediately. And there is a hint to it in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.5.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov</a> - \"For you will have a pact with the rocks in the field\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kilayim.8.5?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Kilayim.8.5.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos Yom Tov</a> about the danger of drawing too near)</p>\n<p>The Rambam in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Kilayim.8.5.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peirush Hamishnayos</a> notes how this creature is of a man-like form and that it converses constantly but is not understandable. However he concludes interestingly by stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומגידים מעניניו בספרים דברים רבים</p>\n<p>It is talked about in many books</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This creature also makes a cameo in the plague of Arov (Wild Beasts). The pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.8.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 8:17</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֣י אִם־אֵינְךָ֮ מְשַׁלֵּ֣חַ אֶת־עַמִּי֒ הִנְנִי֩ מַשְׁלִ֨יחַ בְּךָ֜ וּבַעֲבָדֶ֧יךָ וּֽבְעַמְּךָ֛ וּבְבָתֶּ֖יךָ אֶת־הֶעָרֹ֑ב וּמָ֨לְא֜וּ בָּתֵּ֤י מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ אֶת־הֶ֣עָרֹ֔ב <strong>וְגַ֥ם הָאֲדָמָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־הֵ֥ם עָלֶֽיהָ</strong>׃</p>\n<p>For if you do not let My people go, I will let loose swarms of insects against you and your courtiers and your people and your houses; the houses of the Egyptians, <strong>and the very ground they stand on</strong>, shall be filled with swarms of insects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is understood by some commentaries as a reference to the Adnei HaTzadeh, as due to its umbilical cord that rooted it to the ground, it could only travel whilst moving along the ground that it was on. (Refer to the Vilna Gaon in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14228&st=&pgnum=16&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Eliyahu</a> - last paragraph on the page, The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14078&st=&pgnum=29&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chanukas HaTorah - 59</a> and the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=180096&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=16177887428278262&pagenum=47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Nitzutzei Shimshon</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It is worth noting the Rashi over there which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל תפנו. אַזְהָרָה לְבַעַל אוֹב וְיִדְּעוֹנִי; בַּעַל אוֹב זֶה פִּיתוֹם הַמְדַבֵּר מִשֶּׁחְיוֹ, וְיִדְּעוֹנִי הַמַּכְנִיס עֶצֶם חַיָּה שֶׁשְּׁמָה יַדּוּעַ לְתוֹךְ פִּיו וְהָעֶצֶם מְדַבֵּר (סנהדרין ס\"ה):</p>\n<p>אל תפנו DO NOT TURN [TO THE אבת NOR TO THE ידענים] — This is a warning addressed to the necromancers and the charmers themselves (not to the people who consult these tricksters). The בעל אוב, the controller of the spirit אוב, as the necromancer is called (cf. I Samuel 28:7), is identical with the פיתום (in Greek: πύξωυ); he is one who speaks out of his arm-pit; <strong>ידעני is one who puts a bone of an animal the name of which is ידוע into his mouth and the bone speaks</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.65b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 65b</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this Rashi and the Gemara in Sanhedrin (linked) refer to the point that the Sefer HaChinuch alludes to, about somehow getting hold of a bone from this creature with which one can insert in ones mouth, and the bone speaks on its own.</p>\n\n\n",

In the case of Pesach, various religious ceremonies have been constructed around the basic notion of remembering <em>yetzias mitzrayim</em>, so he refers to these <em>mitzvos</em> second.</li>\n<li><em>Mishpatim</em> as you say are logical <em>mitzvos</em>, the ordinary day-to-day observances. So the wise son asks first about Pesach with its ordinary and extraordinary ceremonies and then asks about the way we conduct ourselves the rest of the year.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

It shows an IDF \"misdar\", a kind of military formation/inspection/ceremony (not really sure how to translate it) on the Temple Mount after it was freed from the Jordanians.</p>\n<p>It's incredible, but my second thought was: What did the religious soldiers do? I believe there's a heter to free the Mount, which is holy, from enemy hands, but was there some sort of heter for them to remain there? I have no evidence that any of those hundreds of soldiers were religious, though, but knowing what the then-Chief Rabbi of the IDF, Rabbi Goren, was like, I'm sure that if it constituted any problem, he wouldn't have stayed silent.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know whether there was a heter, and if so, what was it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R Shlomo Goren and his autobiography (<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/with-might-and-strength-hardcoverhardcover\" rel=\"noreferrer\">With might and strength</a>) explains that he was at the Dome of the Rock the day it became liberated and saw it as a special one-time opportunity. He writes he went back up to the Temple Mount and went to the Dome of the Rock with sappers. He took a Sefer Torah and shofar with him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, because under normal\ncircumstances, Jews are not allowed in there. For one thing, this is\nwhere the Temple stood, and we are impure from touching the dead.\nDuring wartime, however, when we have to go in to check for\nexplosives, that is considered conquering the area and entry is\npermitted. During a military conquest, even entering the Holy of\nHolies is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R Goren, unlike the Chief Rabbinate, believed it was actually permitted to be on the Temple Mount. As Shifra Mescheloff notes in <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3363063\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a very relevant and interest paper</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Goren was of the opinion that the location of the Temple area\ncan be determined with certainty</strong>, by measurements, by relying on\nsources, mainly the writings of the Sages in the Mishna of Tractate\nMiddot, and from Josephus' descriptions. This would enable people who\nare impure from contact with the dead, ,i.e., everyone, to enter the\nplaces on the Temple Mount which are outside of the Temple area [...]</p>\n<p><strong>After Israeli Defense Forces entered the Temple Mount during the Six\nDay War, Rabbi Goren ordered the IDF Engineering Corps to measure the\narea of the Mount</strong>. The task lasted two weeks, after which accurate\nmaps of the Temple Mount were edited and drawn. In his words – \"on the\nbasis of these maps it is possible to delimit the areas in which\nentrance is prohibited according to Maimonides and his stringent\nfaction, and the areas which people impure from contact with dead\nbodies are permitted to enter\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chief Rabbinate rejected this view (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/jewish-world/jewish-news/chief-rabbis-reimpose-ban-on-jews-visiting-temple-mount-333741\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://en.idi.org.il/articles/3951\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) to the sorrow of R Goren.</p>\n<p><strong>The video you are referring notes it was taken \"moments after the Temple Mount was liberated\".</strong> I believe it is referred to on p. 12 of Shifra Mescheloff's paper. <strong>It is likely the soldiers were acting under the instructions of R Goren, the Chief Rabbi of the Army, and the incredible emotions of the day. The full debate on the permissibility of their actions only came to light later</strong> (see p. 13).</p>\n\n\n",

[this leniency applies] even when he cannot speak in a truly appropriate manner, i.e., when he speaks, it is apparent that he is tipsy, but still, <strong>he does not blunder or become befuddled.</strong> [this concept is derived from] the verse: “when you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless g‑d, your l‑rd.” now, after a person [eats to] satiation, there are times when he becomes tipsy. nevertheless, [even in such a situation,] the torah obligates him to recite grace....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Only according to the Gra and the Pri Megadim do brachos lichatchila need to be recited as one able to speak in front of a king, however the Rema writes one is allowed to recite brachos even if he is שכור.

Same thing if Miss Levi and Mister Israel have a girl -- let's call her Sarah Levi-Israel; when that girl grows up, <em>her</em> children, assuming she married an Israelite, need <em>pidyon haben</em> because Sarah's father is an Israelite.</p>\n<p>(This is, by the way, a common mistake; I know a fellow whose bas-kohen maternal grandmother, remembering her own son, insisted that the 100% Israelite grandson didn't need a <em>pidyon haben</em> -- mistakenly. The fellow realized this years later and had to do his own pidyon haben.)</p>\n<p>None of this really changes if the father wasn't Jewish -- the child halachically has a Levite mother, and halacha recognizes no particular father -- the child is basically an Israelite with subprime pedigree for those snobbish about such things. There's no \"Levite blood\" that halachically would affect a future generation.</p>\n<p>(Before arriving at the follow-the-womb logic, the Gemara Bechoros 47a entertained a possibility that the product of a Levite mother and non-Jewish father was more um, Levitic than if the father was an Israelite ... but once the Gemara reaches the follow-the-womb explanation -- and we follow it, per Tosfos s.v. <em>mar berei</em> pointing to Chulin 132a -- it appears we reject that as practical halacha.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is taarof allowed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Persian culture, there is a principle named taarof in which if something is being offered to you, you must decline it, even if you want it. The giver will ask again if you would like the object but even still you must decline it. This process repeats one more time. Then, if the giver was offering out of politeness but didn't actually want to give it to you, he would no longer ask if you would like it. However, if on the 4th round, the giver asks if you would like the object, only then can you accept this object. However, this principle may raise 2 halachic issues. Firstly, the taker lies when he says he does not want it. Second, it seems somewhat like gneivat da'at. One is lying and making a good impression on someone but he does not really deserve this good impression.  Here is the wikipedia page on it: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Welcome to complex Middle Eastern cultures!</p>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch says <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/18794/759\">almost this verbatim if you're asked to be chazan</a> -- you're supposed to decline the first two times, then only take them up on the third offer. It's a sign of showing you're not trying to be arrogant.</p>\n<p>Of course, this works when the person offering it to you understands this is the way the game is played -- which is what avoids the <em>genevat daat</em> issue -- you're not defrauding him if everyone's performing the same script. (It's suggested that often today, if you said \"no\" the Gabbai will think it's literal, and move on to someone else.)</p>\n<p>Mind you, there's a difference between a \"no thank you\" or \"that's really not necessary\" (probably leaves some room for negotiation) and an outright lie like \"I'm allergic to chocolate!\"</p>\n<p>On a similar note, the Mishna says two people can be haggling over a price. The buyer says <em>I swear I'll never eat bananas again if I pay one cent more than $800!</em>. The seller says, <em>oh yeah? I swear I'll never eat apples again if I accept any price less than $1000!</em> Then a few minutes later, they conclude at $900 and both sides walk away relatively satisfied -- and allowed to eat fruit. Everyone understands this is how the game is played.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Menashe and Ephraim in Chronicles 1:9",
    "content": "# Menashe and Ephraim in Chronicles 1:9\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.9.1-34?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chronicles 1:9:1-34</a> there's a description of the people who settled in Yerushalayim. There's a disagreement among commentators whether these people settled in Yerushalayim during the Second Temple period and this chapter is another version of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.11.1-36?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechemiah 11:1-36</a>, or if it's referring to another period entirely, from sometime during the First Temple period. There are noticeable differences between the two chapters. One difference is that only in Chronicles are people from the Tribes of Menashe and Ephraim mentioned to have settled in Yerushalayim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"while some of the Judahites and some of the Benjaminites and <strong>some of the Ephraimites and Manassehites</strong> settled in Jerusalem.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.9.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 3</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is not why they aren't mentioned in Nechemiah, but rather: The leaders of the people of Yehudah, Binyamin, the Kohanim and Levi'im are listed by name, while the leaders of Menashe and Ephraim are not. Why is this so?</p>\n<p>I read a theory presented by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Yehoshua Brand</a> on this, but it seemed way too conspiratorial to me and didn't appear to really fit in with what we know of the character of the authors of Tanach<sup>1</sup>. After all, Ezra and Chronicles were both written by Ezra, and the portion of Ezra that's dictated in the first person appears to have been written by Nechemiah, who was a contemporary of Ezra, and the two were both great and wise men. So I'm looking for something different.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It's an interesting idea nonetheless in my opinion, so I recommend reading, if you can get a copy of his book כלי זכוכית בתלמוד (Glassware in the Talmud). It's in the second section dedicated to various essays not relating to the main subject of the book. I don't remember the title, but it's got something to do with ברית דמשק - the Damascus Covenant. In short, with regards to the verse in Chronicles, he posited that the people of Judea initially welcomed returnees from the Ten Tribes who were living in the remains of the Assyrian Empire, but the Judeans were too proud a people and looked down upon them and refused to let them to actually be counted and listed among them in most official records.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I had a thought today that may possibly answer the question:</p>\n<p>In both chapters, there's an emphasis that the people listed here are leaders and heads of families. In Nechemiah it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>The officers of the people</strong> settled in Jerusalem\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"These are the <strong>heads of the province</strong> who lived in Jerusalem\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All the clan of Periz who were living in Jerusalem—468 <strong>valorous men</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Judah son of Hassenuah was the <strong>second-in-command of the city</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>The heads of the people</strong>: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and so forth, all throughout the chapter.</p>\n<p>Similar terms are used also in Divrei Hayamim, however, that's not the chapter banner. The chapter opens with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All Israel was registered by genealogies; and these are in the book of the kings of Israel. And Judah was taken into exile in Babylon because of their trespass. The first to settle in their towns, on their property, were Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants, while some of the Judahites and some of the Benjaminites and some of the Ephraimites and Manassehites settled in Jerusalem.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then it begins listing the names of the people from Yehudah and Binyamin. Cross-referencing Nechemiah, we know that these people are central in their tribes, but only at the end of the list of Yehudah and Binyamin does it actually say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"and their kinsmen, according to their lines—956. All these were <strong>chiefs of their ancestral clans</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like I said, in Nechemiah this was written right at the beginning of the chapter, while in Divrei Hayamim it was written only from the middle of the chapter and on.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I think perhaps the answer is that while the people from Yehudah, Binyamin, the Levites and kohanim were important leaders, the people from Ephraim and Menashe were not. Perhaps the names of the people who <em>did</em> come were not listed, to serve as a kind of rebuke towards the Ten Tribes, that none of their leaders came.</p>\n\n\n",

So did Rabbi Tanchuma explain it.\n[This does not appear in extant editions of Tanchuma, but in Yalkut\nShim’oni it is quoted from Tanchuma]. In Midrash Genesis Rabbah\n(23:4): Lemech did not kill anyone, but his wives separated from him\nafter they had fulfilled [the commandment of] propagation, because a\ndecree had been issued to destroy Cain’s seed after seven generations.\nThey said, “Why should we give birth in vain? Tomorrow, the Flood will\ncome and inundate everything!” He answered them, “Have I slain a man\nfor whom I should be wounded?

    "content": "# Taking advantage of cultural customs: Stealing or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Persian culture, there is a principle named taarof in which if something is being offered to you, you must decline it, even if you want it. The giver will ask again if you would like the object but even still you must decline it. This process repeats one more time. Then, if the giver was offering out of politeness but didn't actually want to give it to you, he would no longer ask if you would like it. However, if on the 4th round, the giver asks if you would like the object, only then can you accept this object. Here is the Wikipedia page on it: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof</a></p>\n<p>Let's say that you know about this custom. You go into an Iranian jewelry store and ask for the value of a necklace. As per taarof, the shop owner says it is worthless (\"ghaabel nadaareh\"). You know this is taarof but you thank the shop owner and take the item free of charge. You are aware that her offer was mere etiquette but you took advantage of her and 'stole' a necklace.</p>\n<p>Is this halachically allowed? If not, is this considered a robbery in public or robbery in private? What penalties must he pay?</p>\n<p>P.S. I am aware that this is extremely unethical and goes against all ethical and moral values. This is a hypothetical question. I am not actually going to do this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In general, the concept of <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%91_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9D_%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דברים שבלב אינם דברים</a> (see Kiddushin 48b) dictates that if one verbally expresses his participation in a legal or halachic process, it is legally binding even if one didn't actually mean it.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, if you were to ask someone for the price of an item and the merchant tells you to take it for free – and you performed a <em>kinyan</em> – the merchant would not be able to subsequently claim that he didn't mean it.</p>\n<p>However, there is a limitation to this rule – 'דברים שבלבו ובלב כל אדם'. If something is self-evident (אומדנא דמוכח) – where through the context it is self-understood that the verbal expression was not meant to be binding – then we do take his 'דברים שבלב' (thoughts) into account.</p>\n<p>How to define אומדנא דמוכח is a complicated question, which I do not have a clear answer to. I believe that the answer to your question depends on this: In a situation where the <em>taarof</em> process is self-understood and apparent, one who walks out the store with the item is stealing. However, in a situation where this would not constitute the level of self-evident necessary to be considered <em>אומדנא דמוכח</em>, it would be permitted to take the offer at face-value, and take the item without paying for it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "מִלֵּא יָדָם “Ordination” for non-priests?",
    "content": "# מִלֵּא יָדָם “Ordination” for non-priests?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to “Ordination In the Old Testament”\nby Afolarin Olutunde Ojewole, Ph.D.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"The phrase “fill the hand,” containing the word mālēᵓ is translated as “consecrate” or “ordain.” The phrase ultimately became the idiomatic expression for “installing a priest into office,” or “ordination” . See passages like: Exod 28:41; 29;9, 35; 32:29; Lev 8:33; 16:22; 21:10; Num 3:3; Judges 17:5, 12; 1 Kings 13:33; 1 Chron 29:5; 2 Chron 13:9; 29:31. This could have originated from the wages or support a priest received for his services as evidenced in Judges 17 where Micah made his son a priest by ‘filling his hand’ with silver (17:5) and later hiring a Levite and paying him for his priestly services (17:10-12). It could reflect the practice of filling the priest’s hands with the offerings of the sacrificial animals as the reason for the term. In Lev 8:25-29, Moses placed portions of the sacrificial ram and cake offerings in the hands of Aaron and his sons to offer them as a wave offering to God and later consumed them on the altar as “an ordination offering for a soothing aroma” to the Lord (Beck, 1962, p. 667). Numbers 3:3 reads: “These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to minister as priests.” The multiplication of verbs that refer to cultic actions in this short verse is interesting:lemallôt yādô , literally, “fill his hand” meaning “consecrate himself.” This has no cultic connotation but that they commit themselves and their services to God whole-heartedly and sacrificially. In Judges 17:5, a man named Micah made a shrine and installed one of his sons as the priest for it. He waymallēᵓ ᵓet-yad , literally “filled the hand of” meaning “he consecrated.” Later on in Judges 17:12, Micah had found a Levite to install as his personal priest instead; literally: “Micah filled the hand of the Levite” meaning “Micah consecrated the Levite.” Like Numbers 3:3, these two verses have strong cultic connotations pointing to some form of “ordination.” In Numbers 3:3, the phrase millē yādā, as a figure of speech, it literally means: “fill their hand,” thus describing the ceremonial rite of ordination (Kiel & Delitzsch, 1973). This signified two things for the ordination of priests. First, it represented the duty and privilege the priest had in making offerings to the Lord on behalf of others. Second, it represented that the Lord would indeed fill their hand in the sense of providing for the material needs of the priests, representing God’s sufficiency. “‘To fill one’s hand’ (with sacrifices) is ‘to consecrate’ one’s service (1 Chron 29:5; Exod 32:29) or a priest (Judges 17:5)” (Kaiser, p. 506). In Exodus 32:29, after the molten calf experience, Moses told all the children of Israel to milᵓû yedḵem , literally, “fill your hand” meaning “consecrate yourselves.” This has no cultic intention but just that they confess their sins, and re-dedicate themselves to serving God alone.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the writer the term מִלֵּא יָדָם could be used with non-priests ,to mean \" confess ones sins, and re-dedicate himself to serving God alone\"  ...</p>\n<p>in one Jewish apocalyptic text (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_Moses\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">testament of Moses</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And then His kingdom shall appear throughout all His creation, And then Satan shall be no more, And sorrow shall depart with him. Then <em><strong>\"the hands of the angel shall be filled.\"</strong></em> Who has been appointed chief, And he shall forthwith avenge them of their enemies. For the Heavenly One will arise from His royal throne, And He will go forth from His holy habitation With indignation and wrath on account of His sons.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question:</p>\n<p>Why did the writer use The phrase “fill the hand,” with an angel?\nwhat is his intention behind such strange usage?\nwhy do the hands of an angel shall be filled (as a priest ),for a mission of revenge?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First, it must be noted that the text which your question concerns is not canonical in Judaism and there is no extant Hebrew or Aramaic version of the text. So your question concerns the wording of phrasing that passed through multiple stages of translation - Hebrew/Aramaic, to Greek, to Latin, to English.</p>\n<p>That said, assuming that the phrase was in fact originally מלא יד, the general understanding of the phrase is that it typically denotes an investiture of authority, or designation for a particular task or function. While the idiom may have originated in the priestly context, it is not restricted to it.</p>\n<p>For example, see Rashi on Exodus 28:41:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ומלאת את ידם: כל מלוי ידים לשון חנוך, כשהוא נכנס לדבר להיות מוחזק בו מאותו יום והלאה הוא מלוי, ובלשון לעז כשממנין אדם על פקידת דבר, נותן\nהשליט בידו בית יד של עור שקורין גנ\"ט בלעז [כפפה], ועל ידו הוא מחזיקו\nבדבר, וקורין לאותו מסירה ריוישטי\"ר בלעז [להסמיך] והוא מלוי ידים</strong></p>\n<p><em>Heb. וּמִלֵאתָ אֶת-יָדָם, [lit., and you shall fill their hands.] Every mention of “filling of the hands” is an expression of\ninitiation. When he a person begins something such as a position that\nhe will be in possession of from that day on it is referred to as\n“filling” a position. In Old French, when they appoint a person to be\nin charge of something, the ruler puts in his hand a leather glove,\ncalled guanto [gant in modern French], and thereby he grants him\nauthority over the matter. They call this transmission revestir,\ninvest, transmit this glove, and this is the expression “filling of\nthe hands.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, the sectarian author of the work under question appears to have intended that the specified angel was appointed to the particular task, and did not intend to imply that the angel assumed any sort of priestly capacity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have found a commentary on Ezekiel 9:2, that may clarify the matter!</p>\n<p>Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary:\nEzekiel 9:2</p>\n<p>(2. clothed with linen—(Da 10:5; 12:6, 7). <strong>His clothing</strong> marked his office as distinct from that of the six officers of <strong>vengeance</strong>; \"linen\" characterized <strong>the high priest</strong> (Le 16:4); emblematic of purity. The same garment is assigned to <strong>the angel of the Lord</strong> (for whom Michael is but another name) by the contemporary prophet Daniel (Da 10:5; 12:6, 7). Therefore the <strong>intercessory High Priest in heaven</strong> must be meant (Zec 1:12).)\n...................</p>\n<p>It is possible that the writer of \"testament of Moses\" believed the same as what Jamieson-Fausset-Brown ,claims to be the meaning of Ezekiel 9:2</p>\n<p>avenging Priestly angelic heavenly being, who will take that role at the end of days.</p>\n<p>..........</p>\n<p>any comments?</p>\n\n\n",

Since a lunar month is about 29 ½ days, a Hebrew month (which has to have a whole number of days) can have either 29 or 30 days. So the court then had to get the word out to the rest of the Jewish world about which day had been declared the first of the month, so that everyone could observe the holidays on the same day. Originally this was done by signal fires (as in The Lord of the Rings), which transmitted the message rapidly. <strong>But then the Cutheans, a sect opposed to the rabbis, launched the first phishing scam and made signal fires on the wrong days to throw people off.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://reformjudaism.org/passover-7-or-8-days\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://reformjudaism.org/passover-7-or-8-days</a></p>\n<p>When did the \"phishing scam\" occur?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is discussed in <strong>Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 2:2</strong> <blockquote></p>\n<p>Initially, after the court sanctified the new month they would light torches on the mountaintops, from one peak to another, to signal to the community in Babylonia that the month had been sanctified.

I have listened to a few Torah reading tutorial tapes, listened to the Chabad cantillation tune many time, and even did some informal sessions with some of my friends. However, I always seem to fail. I can sing very familiar songs, but I can't figure out why I have never picked up the Chabad trop after so many years of listening to Torah Reading.</p>\n<p>Are there any Chabad Torah Reading tutors or just people with some experience that can give some advice on how to help people who have trouble picking up tunes learn how to lein?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are lots of Torah reading tutors, for almost every possible musical tradition. There are CDs, youtubes, and even programs you can buy. I have no idea what tradition you're looking for, but here's some things to keep in mind generally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you aren't the most musical, then properly learning to read with grammatical rules should be your focus. You can work on the musical aspects later over the course of your lifetime.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Not every tradition has the same melodies, some are more simple, others are more complex. You are not expected to sing perfectly as long as your pronunciation and pauses are done correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Having a teacher is always the best as there are lots of subtleties that get missed when you only practice with tapes or recordings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To the already excellent answers I'd like to add my own take. Mainly out of personal experience, but also out of experiences shared with me. It is not clear to me from your question how you have approached leining so far. But applying a trope to text and memorizing both for leining is a pretty advanced skill. A bar mitzwah can spend months learning an aliyah or more just by hearing the portion leined with trope and commiting it to memore, but this amount of focused practice is not really scalable to actual leining.</p>\n<p>My advice is to start from humble beginnings, a long road that will be short. I will assume for my answer that hebrew might also be a barrier to leining, but if this is not the case, this will help speeding along the steps. The problem is not that you can't commit the trope to memory. From your description it seems you have skipped steps that would have made committing to memory much easier.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: start with knowing the cantilliation marks, know their tune by themselves, and gradually apply this to whatever you are leining or learning about leining.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Find a resource</h2>\n<p>If the specific trope is important to you, then it helps to find someone who knows the trope or find a good online resource for that specific trope. That would be step 1.</p>\n<p>sidenote:\nAlthough not a 'step 1' thing, this (re)source will be important to you from step 4 onward. There are a lot of special rules and circumstances that can pop up now and again, which are not visible in the cantilliation marks, or are almost never mentioned in more general introductury texts about trope. To name some specific examples to the Dutch trope, most of which are probably pretty universal in some variant or another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The basic melody of the sof pasuk (full stop) ends with bending down low note. But whenever Hashem's name is the final word of the sentence the sof pasuk melody needs to stay high, or bend towards a high note</li>\n<li>The community of the Hague has a different (fourth) aliyah break then the community of Amsterdam.</li>\n<li>There might be special melodies required at some parts</li>\n<li>Some parts (such as the 'curses') need to be leined silently yet audible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 2: learn the ta'amim with trope.</h2>\n<p>Once you have someone or another resource that gives you acces to the trope, try to familiarize yourself with the way the trope is used. You have done this part if I read your question correctly: you have heard the trope applied. Listen to it with a new focus: every tradition has some variation, and you will often find specific rules or embellishments unique to that trope, or to the baal koreh. Don't be afraid to make the trope yours. Maybe the way you've heard it just isn't 'you'. Sometimes a little superficial change can help make it more natural to you and easier to reproduce. If you know a baal koreh, or you hear a recording that leins a trope in a musically advanced way: don't be afraid to simplify it.</p>\n<p>Also, don't fall into the trap of learning the trope by committing to memory every 'melody' for a grouping of ta'amim. Most of these memories are little more than the melodies of the individual ta'amim in sequence. Depending on your trope there might be some combinations you need to know, such as the kadma-zakef_katon combined on one (hyphenated) word, but these will become apparant when you have a recording available. For me, these long lists of 'groupings melodies' were incredibly demotivational. After deciding to not even try to learn them I have not missed out. Every once in a while i check whether I'm missing something and so far I haven't really found a unique melody in a grouping that I couldn't also produce just be knowing the basic melody of each individual ta'am.</p>\n<p>Word of caution: mind the 'munach'. This is the only ta'am that is truly contextual. If you are practicing from a ta'am 'set' the munach will be included wherever its melody is adapated to serve the accompanying ta'am. When you start leining develop an ear for the munach when you hear other people leining. With experience you will develop a musical feeling for how to play with the munach.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Musical grammar before music.</h2>\n<p>First and foremost the ta'amim represent a grammatical tradition, and are the heart and soul of the language of the Torah. Make sure you understand how the trope serves to support the grammar. You don't have to start learning Hebrew grammar, rather start getting a basic understanding of the types of ta'amim and what their function is in a sentence. This helps tremendously because knowing which ta'amim need to be correctly leined and which ones don't require correction during leining will bring focus to your learning. Not every ta'am will draw equal focus and attention, and you can feel the flow of the ta'amim; how they are grouped, which ones are logical given the text, etc. Just understanding the ta'amim in a simple, basic way will help you memorize trope in a big way. If you are serious about leining, don't skip this step.</p>\n<p>My first advice is to not start leining. If you have difficulty remembering melodies the best start in my opinion is to learn the trope without applying it to text. Many siddurim, chumashim, or trope website contain the list of cantilliation marks (ta'amim). If you have found your resource in step 1, and you've heard the trope used on text in step 2 you are ready to commit the basic trope to memory. Depending on your hardship with remembering melodies you could opt for two routes (A) repeat and repeat and repeat the trope for all the ta'amim, or (B) start repeating the most common and important ta'amim, and only add the less common and special ta'amim when you are comfortable with the 'normal' set. In the end it won't matter much what route you take as long as you take the route that keeps you motivated to continue.</p>\n<p>For route A: find a list with all the ta'amim, such as <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/cant4.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://bible.ort.org/books/cant4.asp</a></p>\n<p>Just say the name of each ta'am at first. No melody. Just repeat all the ta'amim in order, by name until you can recognize each ta'am. Your teaching yourself a new alphabet basically, so this phase is necessary to learn to read the ta'amim.</p>\n<p>If you can comfortably recognize each ta'am and identify it by name you can start adding melodies at your own pace. The link to bible.ort.org has helpful coloring that might aid in deciding how to 'chunk' your learning. The colors help identify the common grouping of these ta'amim. Don't worry too much about what that means. Hear the melody of each ta'am, pick a few you are comfortable repeating. And each day make some time to repeat the melodies of one group of ta'amim. If you feel comfortable expanding, because you feel you can produce the melody of one group without having to hear a recording, then feel free to do so.</p>\n<p>Don't worry that this phase can take a while. It is very common that people need about two weeks of practice to memorize the tune of the whole ta'am set. Route A can take a month in total for some people. The great thing is that every hour spent on this step (either route A or B) will greatly help you make progress further down the road. Take your time and enjoy knowing the basic trope to the ta'amim.</p>\n<p>For route B:\nBasically, route A with less pressure on the melody-recall</p>\n<p>What helps is to understand that not all ta'amim are equal. The ta'amim that represents the stops and pauses, the Melachim (Kings) are critical. Fortunately, they are not that hard musically. The most prominent of these are the sof posuk (and of sentence), the etnachta (semicolon) and the zakef katon (comma). Just knowing these few will help you through a lot of text. Then you have what I would call the 'transitive' ta'amim, such as the kadma, mapach (shofar holech), etc. that are meant to connect one word with the subsequent word, and are very low on melody and are not to be emphasized as a standalone melody. Together the Melachim and the transitive are very very low on melody, and just getting these right in pacing (clear stops, clear transitions) will make you a great baal koreh. There are even some beginning baalei koreh that only apply trope to the Melachim and homogenize the rest, but even though I know this is halachically allowed I have never felt good about this. But: if this is an option that helps you stay on course: choose it.</p>\n<p>The more embellished ta'amim have some space for personalization. I know people who make extra work on the melody of the segol or of the tlisha ketana, but within the same trope I also know some great baalei koreh who do these with a minimalistic melody. So my takeaway: as long as you focus on the critical ta'amim during leining, and your personal adaptation of the trope is sufficiently recognizable as that trope, then you are ready to scale your work up.</p>\n<p>I cheat. Some melodies are easy to remember with a bit of knowledge: a shalshelet is basically a triple darga, so I just copy-paste a darga three times and there is my beautiful shalshelet. Just knowing this helped me because it was one ta'am I didn't really have to remember. Same with the karnei farah, which might have its own melody, but your Tikkun will probably explain that it is a combination of two common ta'amim, and that you just need to do them in the right order (tlisha ketana first, even though it is written at the end of the word).</p>\n<p>In the beginning focus on the common ta'amim. If you have a hard time remembering the special ones: don't bother as of yet. Start leining aliyot that do not have these special ta'amim, or if you do encounter one: just learn to one special ta'am for the occasion. I never seem to get the mercha kefulah of the Torah-trope committed to memory. The rare occasion I need to know it I just relearn it for that occasion. As long as I know the basics it won't hamstring my other leining</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Choose your path: Haftarah or Torah</h2>\n<p>Many people I know would probably advise you to start learning Hebrew grammar, and leining specifics, but I like getting down in the trenches and building from there. Depending on your background there are two options that will help you prepare for Torah leining:</p>\n<p>A: Lein Haftarah first.\nOkay, this requires going back to the first steps, because those same ta'amim need to be relearned with a new melody. Downside two is that haftarah Hebrew is (at least to me) more difficult than Torah Hebrew. The advantage is that you don't need to learn the text by heart (in most communities). You can spend one or two weeks practicing the Haftarah with trope, focus on the trope, and lein it to the congregation. In most communities, I've been in, so I assume yours is similar, lein or allow leining Haftarah from books that have both nekudot and cantillation marks (ta'amim). It is hard enough to read a text with musical grammar, so focusing on just learning to read in such a way can help to build a musical memory for text.</p>\n<p>Once reading Haftarah becomes second nature, you will notice that memorizing Torah and its trope has its challenge reduced, because now 'reading' Torah will mean 'reading with trope'. The trope has become second nature and you can start tackling just remembering the parasha, instead of both the text and trope as completely separate elements. There will certainly be some separation that makes practicing Torah leining so challenging (and rewarding), but this is tackled in a later step.</p>\n<p>B: Start with Torah.\nSome people like facing their challenges head-on. If you just want to lein Torah and focus on that, start with the Maftir. Usually, the maftir is also the one who leins Haftarah, so you can also opt to combine A and B. But: if you let your rabbi-gabbai-baál koreh know that you just want to lein the maftir portion, then there are ways to let you do that without also letting you do the haftarah.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what you started with you will have to start doing Torah leining at some point. and the maftir is a good start. The maftir is usually between 3 to 5 verses, with only some maftir-portions considerably longer. In the beginning, even such a small portion can prove a challenge, so don't worry that if this is the case for you that it must indicate a failure on your part. Leining is just hard, especially if you didn't start young.</p>\n<p>After the maftir has become too easy to be personally rewarding consider taking up the Shabbat-mincha portions. The first regular-aliyah is separated into three portions, and just scaling up to the cohen-portion can be a worthy challenge.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Scaling up: portion size and knowledge-base.</h2>\n<p>If you have reached step 5, then you are probably so far on this road that you know what you need. For the sake of completion, there is only one tip that is sufficiently universal:</p>\n<p>Learning Torah leining takes time. A lot of time. If you were leining and you forgot the tope midway, or the words escaped you: the only true solution for the next time is to spend more time. If you spent 40 hours memorizing the parasha and it wasn't enough, spend 50 hours.</p>\n<p>That's it. The following tips help overcome problems with melody and text over time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the text: understanding the hebrew you are reading will help memorize the trope. Text you understand will reduce cognitive load and increase working memory capacity for committing and recalling melody to and from memory.</li>\n<li>Understand biblical Hebrew grammar. Start with basic things that aid memorization. For example: knowing that words like 'lechem' become 'lachem' at the end of a (part-) sentence will greatly increase your ability to recall the word and ta'am. On the one hand knowing that the word requires a zakef katon or munach, means its not 'lachem', and conversely, just knowing that the word is 'lachem' will also help you recall that this word requires an etnachta or sof pasuk.</li>\n<li>Don't postpone scaling up to full parshiot until you can do single aliyot flawlessly. For one: everyone makes mistakes once in a while; flawless performances are utopian. Secondly and more importantly: the type of practice that works for single aliyot does not scale up to multiple aliyot or full parshiot. Especially long parshiot are not easily repeated multiple times in full during one practice session. So if you stay practicing single aliyot you will not learn how to handle the big portions. At some point decide you know how to lein and just take the plunge. Take something manageable such as Nitzawim or Vayelech, or pick four aliyot of a larger parasha, and struggle through it. It will pay off.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sorry for the long post.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Dunno if this is <em>the</em> way, but there is a standard tune for the Ashkenazi trop, running through all the symbols.

Rosh Hashana comes from the verse</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ דֹּרֵ֣שׁ אֹתָ֑הּ תָּמִ֗יד עֵינֵ֨י יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ בָּ֔הּ <strong>מֵֽרֵשִׁית֙ הַשָּׁנָ֔ה</strong> וְעַ֖ד אַחֲרִ֥ית שָׁנָֽה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and Rosh Chodesh comes from the verse</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַחֹ֧דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֛ה לָכֶ֖ם <strong>רֹ֣אשׁ חֳדָשִׁ֑ים</strong> רִאשׁ֥וֹן הוּא֙ לָכֶ֔ם לְחָדְשֵׁ֖י הַשָּׁנָֽה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think part of the question is your statement \"is called\". I am cobbling together some thoughts with no real authority so I apologize, but I think it difficult to account for conveniences and popular trends that might not have any halachic weight.</p>\n<p>The first thing is that there are contexts in which the noun has no introductory definite article -- the primary one I thought of is the first mishna in Masechet Rosh Hashana. The text reads אַרְבָּעָה רָאשֵׁי שָׁנִים. Since there are four, when discussing any particular one of them, the text specifies which one</p>\n<p>בְּאֶחָד בְּנִיסָן רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לַמְּלָכִים וְלָרְגָלִים</p>\n<p>בְּאֶחָד בֶּאֱלוּל רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לְמַעְשַׂר בְּהֵמָה</p>\n<p>etc.</p>\n<p>So the \"ha\" is the beginning of a longer phrase which might suggest that the actual name of the holiday we celebrate on 1-2 Tishrei is properly called \"רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה לַשָּׁנִים וְלַשְּׁמִיטִּין וְלַיּוֹבְלוֹת לִנְטִיעָה וְלִירָקוֹת\" and we just abbreviate it to \"Rosh Hashana.\"</p>\n<p>Additionally, the word \"chodesh\" can be used not just for a month, but for any period of 29-30 days (as we say מבן חדש ומעלה even if the child is not born on a new moon). So is it possible that we are simply saying \"the beginning of this counting of 30 days\" which would not mean any specific one and would not need a definite article?</p>\n<p>Maybe, but it is also important to remember that when we talk about a specific month, we DO use the definite article. The Ibn Ezra, on Hoshea 2:13 writes, \"הוא ראש החדש שתתחדש הלבנה\". In fact, in our davening, when we commemorate the celebration of the new month, the language is יום ראש החדש הזה (from back in the Yerushalmi, through early siddurim to today). Again, the \"ha\" is introducing a specific month, not the general idea of 30 days (as in the Abarbenel on Pinchas, \"אברבנאל במדבר פרשת פינחס פרק כט\nולפי שהיה יום תרועה ראש החדש השביעי\").</p>\n<p>There is the same 'tension' when referring to the weekly Shabbat. In some cases, people call it \"Yom Shabbat\"</p>\n<p>the Medrash Tanchuma writes, \"כיצד ברא הקב\"ה ימים וברר לו אחד מהם שנא' (תהלים קלט) ימים יצרו ולו אחד בהם איזה הוא א\"ר לוי זה יום שבת\"</p>\n<p>and there are a bunch of other Aggadic uses of the phrase, whereas other situations, starting in the chumash use Yom HaShabbat.</p>\n<p>All of these conventions of naming might simply be evolutions of comfort, not statements of exegetical import.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, they recognized that they were  acting AGAINST the Bible's claim that there is only one G-d.</p>\n<p>The concept of G-d being one and multiple at the same time does not appear in Jewish literature until after the establishment of Christianity, when the Jewish authors of philosophical works started to counter it as being illogical and wrong. It does not seem at all possible that an idea that almost all Jews have considered heretical, and which many Jews died rather than agree to, would have existed previously without occasioning comment.</p>\n<p>It is worth pointing out that the Rabbinic descriptions of Jesus do not have him claiming divinity. Instead, they have him disputing the rabbis and claiming to be the Messiah. In the Jewish tradition, the claims of divinity for Jesus came later as a result of his followers trying to spread Christianity among non-Jews. They tried to give him the qualities pagans expected of a divinity (birth from a divine being, etc.) without losing their claim to monotheism, which resulted in the awkward \"have your cake and eat it too\" claim of the trinity.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but the claim would not stand up to the deeper understanding of G-d's Oneness.

He is not two nor more than two, but One; so that none of the things existing in the universe to which the term one is applied is like unto His Unity; neither such a unit as a species which comprises many units (e.g. sub-species), nor such a unit as a physical body which consists of parts and dimensions. His Unity is such that there is no other Unity like it in the world. If there were plural deities, these would be physical bodies; because entities, that can be enumerated and are equal in their essence, are only distinguishable from each other by the accidents* that happen to physical bodies. If the Creator were a physical body, He would have bounds and limits, for it is impossible for a physical body to be without limits; and where a body is limited and finite, its energy is also limited and finite. And our God, blessed be his Name, since His power is infinite and unceasing—for the Sphere (of the Universe) is continually revolving—His power is not the energy of a physical body. And since He is not a physical body, the accidents that happen to physical bodies do not apply to Him, so as to distinguish Him from another being. Hence, it is impossible that He can be anything but One. To realize this truth is an affirmative precept, as it is said \"The Eternal, our God, is One God\" (Deut. 6:4).<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>1 <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-One.htm#v7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesodei haTorah - Chapter One\nBy Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (\"Maimonides\"); translated by Eliyahu Touger</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 1\nTrans. by Eliyahu Touger</a></sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Since Abraham, the first Jew, Judaism has been devoted to a simple one God.  \"Minim\" מינים heretics I believe refers to various Gnostic groups (does its etymology mean \"kinds\" as in those two view different kinds and numbers of gods?)</p>\n<p>When is the \"advent\" of Christianity -- Jesus or Paul or the later Gospels?

The effects of this warfare left their scars on Judaism. When the Greek Gnostic challenge threatened the Torah way of life, two distinct trends emerged; one to fight Gnosticism tooth and nail, and the other to incorporate elements of Gnosticism into Judaism. <br>\nThe latter view held that as long as Jewish law or basic philosophical theological concepts were not compromised in any way, there was no harm in this. Among those that chose the route of no-compromise, there were those who felt that any acceptance of Gnostic thought and its neutralization into the faith would be a constant source of danger and dissension. Others chose to accept the no-compromise route as their personal preference, and withheld from publicly challenging the compromisers. However, those who compromised were, nevertheless, bitter enemies of pure Idolatrous Gnosticism. The tensions engendered in these attitudes have surfaced throughout Christian and Jewish history.\nIn Judaism, the Midrashic literature encompassing much legendary material on the Bible as well as minor randomly interspersed legendary sections of the Talmud between its major legalistic sections, initially became the repository of the tamed Gnosticism. Out of these basic writings grew a unique literature that resulted in the development of some of the finest ethical and morally influential systems on Jewish life, which even anti-Gnostic purists acknowledged had spiritual edification despite their opposition to what they considered the basic superstitious premises upon which these ethical systems were built. The Zohar is exemplary of this literature.\n...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Our understanding of God is (for the most part) limited to a reflection of our understanding of man.</p>\n<p>Within the human psyche there are quite well defined areas of thought and feeling that are identified in modern psychology (e.g. see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis#The_ego-state,_or_Parent%E2%80%93Adult%E2%80%93Child_(PAC),_models\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis#The_ego-state,_or_Parent%E2%80%93Adult%E2%80%93Child_(PAC),_models</a>) which correspond relatively well to the kabbalistic areas of \"God's mind\" (e.g. see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot</a>).</p>\n<p>So the notion of, for example, the functions of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are not new.

He also tentatively suggests that in Italy, France, Northern Spain, i.e. lands where Christianity predominated, it was deleted due to the possible danger associated with its recitation. However he admits that this perspective is not without challenge due to the various cases of exception that can be identified.</p>\n<p>Other than the matter of not departing from one's received nusah (which is a point that could be rallied by either side in favor of its inclusion/exclusion), I'm not sure why you assume that the different traditions on this point are rooted in a halakhic rationale.

The whole Kaddish is praying for G-d's greatness and exaltedness to be revealed to the whole world. The time when this will be carried out will be the Messianic era. Thus, it's very appropriate to include it. The question therefore is: why do Ashkenazim not say it?</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Products/AL1H.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleinu Leshabeach</a> in Parshas Vayechi, there appears an explanation in the name of <a href=\"http://www.eilatgordinlevitan.com/kovno/kovno_pages/kovno_stories_shulman.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Mordechai Shulman</a> of why Ashkenazi custom leaves out the phrase.</p>\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.98b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 98b</a>) quotes the amoraim Ulla and Rabba as saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ייתי ולא איחמיניה\n<strong>Let the Messiah come, but</strong> after my death, so that <strong>I\nwill not see him</strong>, as I fear the suffering that will precede his\ncoming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The non-bolded words are the explanation from R' Steinsaltz)</p>\n<p>In other words, as much as we want Moshiach to come, there is also reason to hope not to actually see him in our lifetime since his coming will be accompanied with lots of suffering.\nBased on this, we do not add in the words \"May He make the salvation sprout forth and bring His Moshiach close\" to Kaddish, even though it fits with the general theme of Kaddish. As much as we are praying for salvation, this is one facet of the redemption that we would prefer not to be hastened.</p>\n<p>It should be mentioned that although Rav Shulman used the gemara to explain the custom of ommitting the phrase, it is not clear that he was actually explaining the original source of the minhag. He may just have been giving an explanation of the custom, not the source.</p>\n<p>(It should be mentioned that in that same gemara, Rav Yosef emphatically declares that he wants to see the coming of Moshiach and would be willing to suffer any negative consequence necessary.

For clarity's sake, \"holy\" is <em>usually</em> applicable to <em>sentient</em> beings who owe the status to themselves and \"sacred\" applies to inanimate objects and animals (\"holy cow\" notwithstanding) whose status is conferred on them by sentients. However, this is <em>not</em> important.</p>\n<p><strong>PS2</strong>. Hebrew also has a single word לאהוב for \"love/like\". The lack of nuance might be an artifact of the language being ancient.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think part of the issue with the question is that the terms \"holy\" and \"sacred\" are not clearly enough defined in distinctly different ways.</p>\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> page, there appears the following distinction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Holiness is generally the term used in relation to persons and\nrelationship, whereas sacredness is used in relation to objects,\nplaces, or happenings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A couple of lines later, the same Wikipedia page quotes a different source saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship\nof God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration,\nholy (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply that the difference is whether the holiness is intrinsic or just imposed from the outside; seemingly this disagrees with the first explanation.</p>\n<p>Then, I found the following <a href=\"https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Holiness is a concept, a virtue that is inside a person or a thing. It\nis because of this virtue that he is called or referred to as holy.\nThus, you consider a saint as holy, but he is not sacred to you.\nHowever, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the\nholy bible. Sacred is a word used to distinguish worldly things and\nconcepts from those that are godly or in some way connected with god.\nIn general, holy is more of an abstract concept whereas concrete\nobjects are considered sacred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then I came across this answer here on the <a href=\"https://english.stackexchange.com/a/84864/382302\">English stack Exchange</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whenever you have two Modern English words that mean almost exactly\nthe same thing, it is probable that only one existed in Old English,\nwhile the other was imported from the Romance languages, there having\nbeen several such bulk imports in English's history. This appears to\nbe the situation with holy and sacred: the former is Old English, the\nlatter comes from Latin sacer by way of French sacre and the oldest\ncitation in the OED is 1380 (referring specifically to the Eucharist)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(He then quotes the Oxford English Dictionary which basically implies this is correct.)</p>\n<p>The practical upshot of this is that it's not clear at all what the difference between holy and sacred is, if at all.\nIt either has to do with what sort of noun is being described (animate vs. inanimate), or being an intrinsic or extrinsic quality, or being \"godly\" vs being set aside for god, or perhaps there is no difference at all!</p>\n<p>Since there does not seem to be a clear-cut distinction between the words, it does not bother me that the root ק-ד-ש accounts for them all.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>i did find one other distinction drawn <a href=\"https://hinative.com/en-US/questions/12769241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and this does find a parallel in Hebrew.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my understanding, as you pointed out, these days one can say sacred\nnot necessarily in religious context but also figuratively when\nsomething is really important to somebody, as if it had been sacred in\nthe traditional sense. e.g. His extensive collection of 60s rock\nrecords is sacred to him. On the other hand holy is specifically used\nin relation to God, gods or transcendence, and it has rather strong\nChristian connotations to be more specific. Correct me on it if I had\na major misunderstanding about it, if you please</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this explanation, sacred just means dedicated and special for, without a reference to G-d. Holy, however, always applies to G-d.</p>\n<p>This is also the 4th definition listed <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/sacred\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This does have a parallel in Hebrew. The root ק-ד-ש does have different connotations depending if it is in the פיעל or הפעיל form.</p>\n<p>The word מַקְדִּישׁ (makdish) always refers to dedicating an item to G-d and the Beis HaMikdosh- making it holy. The word מְקַדֵּשׁ (mekaddesh) refers to designating something and making it set aside, unique, without it becoming the property of G-d or the Beis HaMikdosh.</p>\n<p>Thus when a man betroths a woman, he is מקדש אותה (mekaddesh otah). When a man designates an animal to become a korban (sacrifice) in the Beis HaMikdash, he is מקדיש (makdish) the animal.</p>\n<p>In summary: The terms \"holy\" and \"sacred\" are <em>not</em> so clearly defined enough as to really be different words, so that having one Hebrew word is adequate. It could be that there is no difference at all between holy and sacred. And according to one definition which does make a distinction between the words, we found that Hebrew does indeed account for the difference in terms.</p>\n\n\n",

That when he says space about something spiritual, he doesn’t mean some sort of aura that fills or surrounds it. Rather any space related term, when used in a spiritual context is meant as an allegory. So what exactly does space mean when used in a spiritual context? My understanding is something like an idea/ paradigm. We could say that an idea is memaleh/inside of you. Meaning you understand it and it’s changed you in some way. Or that the idea is sovev you meaning you are in the midst of trying to understand it and so are focused and busy with the idea.  (Both examples are from chapter 5(?) of Tanya.) we could also say someone lives in a particular spiritual world if they think/emote/act in a particular paradigm. So someone is lives in yetzirah if they have changed their basic emotional response to be in line with hashem being the master of everything. Obviously this person also loves in the physical world and those two things aren’t a contradiction. He physically lives in this physical space and mentally/spiritually lives in a particular spiritual “space”.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>He is saying (paraphrased):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not like physical space, where there is a concept of encircling</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then he says <em>what it really means</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but the meaning is that it “encircles and encompasses from above” insofar as the revelation of this influence is concerned, for influence, which is in the category of “revelation” in the worlds, is referred to as “investiture,” being “clothed” within the worlds, for the influence that they receive is clothed and comprehended by them, i.e., they are able to comprehend and internalize it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is identical to what he does with the explanation of space to mimaleh. He basically says \"it doesn't mean height/length\" like in physical terms, and then he explains <em>what it really means</em>.</p>\n<p>So, I don't see a difference.</p>\n<p>Also worth noting that <em>Mimaleh</em> is within the spiritual. <em>Sovev</em> is not \"spiritual\", chas veshalom.

    "content": "# Can the word Cushi be used for non-blacks?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I came across an argument that the word Cushi can be used for both non-blacks and gentiles. They argued that Moses married a Cushi, yet Moses' wife, according to Rashi, was not actually black. Therefore, the word Cushi can be used to refer to those who are not actually black and, in extension, can be used to refer to gentiles in general.</p>\n<p>I wasn't so sure what to make of this. Is this interpretation far-fetched? Are there examples of the word Cushi being used to refer to those without dark-skin in traditional sources (Talmud, Midrashim, etc.)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The plain meaning of Cushi refers to someone of the Cushite Nation, and indeed there's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HaYashar_(midrash)%2C_Book_of_Exodus.33?vhe=Sefer_HaYashar,_Livorno_1870&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a midrash</a> that suggests that Moshe first married a Cushite princess before marrying Tzippora. With that said, \"Cushi\" was sometimes interpreted to refer to someone who stood out in their actions. There are a few examples I'm aware of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>King Shaul:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The response to this admonishment is found in the verse, as it is written: “Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite” (Psalms 7:1). Is Cush his name? Saul is his name. Rather, this is a designation that indicates: Just as a Cushite, a native of the ancient kingdom of Cush in eastern Africa, is distinguished by his dark skin, so too, Saul was distinguished by his actions, as he was absolutely righteous and performed many good deeds.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Moed_Katan.16b.18?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moed Katan 16b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Michal, daughter of Shaul and wife of David:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rather, we must say that it is this tanna who maintains that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries, as it was taught in a baraita: Michal, daughter of Kushi, King Saul, would don phylacteries, and the Sages did not protest against her behavior, as she was permitted to do so.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eruvin.96a.13?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eruvin 96a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Baruch the Scribe:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One Scripture saith, \"And Ebedmelech, the Cushite, said\" (Jer. 38:12). Was it Ebed? Was he not Baruch, son of Neriah? But just as this Cushite is different in his body from all other people, so was Baruch, son of Neriah, different in his deeds and good ways from the rest of the sons of men. Therefore was he called a Cushite.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.53.6?vhe=Pirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 53:6</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>King Tzidkiyahu:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Gemara continues: Similarly, you can explain the verse: “Now when Ebed-Melech the Cushite heard” (Jeremiah 38:7). Is his name Cushite? Zedekiah is his name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his dark skin, so too, Zedekiah was distinguished by his righteous actions.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Moed_Katan.16b.19?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moed Katan 16b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The People of Yisrael:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Similarly, you can explain the verse: “Are you not as much Mine as the children of the Cushites, O children of Israel?” (Amos 9:7).

But is her name Cushite? Zipporah is her name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his dark skin, so too, Zipporah was distinguished by her actions.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As others have answered the word Cushite could be used to refer to people who aren't necessarily black. But in my opinion the amount of mental gymnastics the commentators use to justify such a non literal reading isn't usually helpful. Cushite's most common and straightforward meaning is blackness. So much so that it allows Jeremiah to make the following statement without any confusion to the reader:</p>\n<p><strong>Jeremiah 13:23</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֲיַהֲפֹ֤ךְ כּוּשִׁי֙ עוֹר֔וֹ וְנָמֵ֖ר חֲבַרְבֻּרֹתָ֑יו גַּם־אַתֶּם֙\nתּוּכְל֣וּ לְהֵיטִ֔יב לִמֻּדֵ֖י הָרֵֽעַ׃</p>\n<p>Can the Cushite change his skin, Or the leopard his spots?

For example, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/2346085/jewish/The-Cushite-Woman.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Cushite Woman</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tzipporah, the wife of Moses, is referred to as a Cushite. Why is she\ndescribed as a Cushite when she actually was a Midianite?</p>\n<p>The Cushites historically were a dark-skinned people. A dark-skinned\nwoman is a rare visage in the Torah; thus, the Torah is metaphorically\ndescribing that Tziporah was unusual in her deeds. (Talmud, Moed Katan\n16b)</p>\n<p>Commentaries explain that just as a dark-skinned person is immediately\nnoticeable, so too an individual described as a Cushite possesses a\ncharacter that is obvious and clear to all. (Ben Yehoyada, ibid.)</p>\n<p>What was so great about Tzipporah? She was exceptionally modest and\nunassuming in her actions. (Talmid Rabeinu Yechiel of Paris, ibid.)</p>\n<p>Alternatively, she was capable of transforming the physical into\nspiritual and darkness into light.

It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּנְיָא: אָמְרוּ עָלָיו עַל רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל, כְּשֶׁהָיָה שָׂמֵחַ שִׂמְחַת בֵּית הַשּׁוֹאֵבָה, הָיָה נוֹטֵל שְׁמֹנֶה אֲבוּקוֹת שֶׁל אוֹר, וְזוֹרֵק אַחַת וְנוֹטֵל אַחַת וְאֵין נוֹגְעוֹת זוֹ בָּזוֹ. וּכְשֶׁהוּא מִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה, נוֹעֵץ שְׁנֵי גּוּדָלָיו בָּאָרֶץ וְשׁוֹחֶה וְנוֹשֵׁק אֶת הָרִצְפָּה וְזוֹקֵף, וְאֵין כׇּל בְּרִיָּה יְכוֹלָה לַעֲשׂוֹת כֵּן, <strong>וְזוֹ הִיא קִידָּה</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita: They said about Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel that when he would rejoice at the Celebration of the Place of the Drawing of the Water, he would take eight flaming torches and toss one and catch another, juggling them, and, though all were in the air at the same time, they would not touch each other. And when he would prostrate himself, he would insert his two thumbs into the ground, and bow, and kiss the floor of the courtyard and straighten, and there was not any other creature that could do that due to the extreme difficulty involved. <strong>And this was the form of bowing called kidda</strong> performed by the High Priest.

Rabbi Berel Wein, for example, has said that a convert who keeps wanting to go to their non-Jewish family's Christmas party is bad news for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>Here's an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://judaismconversion.org/geirus-policies-and-standards/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbinical Council of America's conversion procedures</a>; this is mainstream Centrist Orthodox (and a conversion they do will be recognized by the Israeli rabbinate). Emphasis added below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exposure to Communal Life by Living in an Orthodox community</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As far as the halacha is concerned, conversion involves the creation of a transformed, fully reborn, new person. Becoming fully part of the Jewish family, one literally acquires a new family, a new life and as such one reorients one’s entire being. The candidate will be expected to cultivate new friendships, new relationships, new social activities, new Torah commitments. Moreover, as with any Jew, the growth and learning process continues throughout one’s life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Requirements of Other People in a Candidate’s Life</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a candidate is previously intermarried or is converting for the sake of an individual Jew (as per above), the spouse’s observance level and attitudes must be consistent with the present and future Torah observance of the candidate and not be a source of conflict or opposition to the convert’s adopting a halachic lifestyle. <strong>The Beit Din should also consider whether other significant individuals in the candidate’s life such as parents, or any existing minor children, will have an impact on the success or failure of the process and the aftermath of conversion.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds much more like a \"be prepared for some difficult conversations\" than a slam-the-door.</p>\n<p>(It is true that <em>halacha</em> views a new convert as no one's relative per se from a technical standpoint; that's different.)</p>\n<p>I will take it a step further, in light of Rabbi Feinstein's nuances on this very topic, and say the sever-everything position is ... well perhaps someone misunderstood, or it was only intended in particular circumstances.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's responsum YD2:130, summer 1962, to Rabbi Samuel Yalow of Syracuse -- an adult convert who hasn't visited her non-Jewish mother for years, and now wants to do so as her mom is ailing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion: even without the illness, she was allowed to occasionally visit, if not doing so would have been seen as ungrateful; but to be a regular visitor would be prohibited, to prevent sliding back from Judaism. [The convert's] children certainly shouldn't get used to going there, as they may serve them non-kosher. But now that the non-Jewish mother is ailing -- besides the fact that we are obligated to tend to sick non-Jews too -- she is <em>obligated</em> to go visit her, with the children, as a small amount of honor for parents vs. disgrace, as Maimonides wrote [befits the non-Jewish parents of converts] and is ruled as such in Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein's secretary records similar missives in <em>Mesoras Moshe</em> Volume II, pages 265--266:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Must a convert distance from his non-Jewish family</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... a sincere convert who cried as <em>someone</em> had told her to distance herself completely from her parents -- [Rabbi Feinstein said] that's not what she was actually obligated to do. As Maimonides says he must honor them somewhat, out of gratitude ... <strong>once Maimonides introduces the concept of honor, to plain-out sever and decree they can't meet at all is tremendous wickedness.</strong> [<em>Rish'us gedolah!</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... In this particular case, the parents were in England ... the whole point of distancing was to prevent any concern that they'd influence her to return to her old life ... the rabbi advised that she go visit once a year, bring her [Jewish] husband, and stay at a hotel, not her parents' house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another time, the rabbi answered that a non-Jewish grandfather could be addressed as <em>Sabba</em> or \"grandfather\", just be careful to only visit him every so often [<em>b'akrai</em>], with the same explanation as listed above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rabbi told Rabbi Twersky of Denver to tell converts that they should visit their non-Jewish parents several times a year -- while we don't want too much closeness, don't distance them to the point of \"disgrace\", which Maimonides prohibited ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He will build the Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel.</p>\n<p>Then, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah.</p>\n<p>Anyone who does not believe in him or does not await his coming, denies not only the statements of the other prophets, but those of the Torah and Moses, our teacher.

Even if your Diaspora is at the ends of the heavens, God will gather you up from there... and bring you to the land....</p>\n<p>These explicit words of the Torah include all the statements made by all the prophets.</p>\n<p>Reference to Mashiach is also made in the portion of Bilaam who prophesies about two anointed kings: the first anointed king, David, who saved Israel from her oppressors; and the final anointed king who will arise from his descendants and save Israel in the end of days.

And maybe, if he wanted to put each proof in it's own halacha, then why are the first two grouped together?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>why does the Rambam say the name of the parsha that the second proof is located in, \"in the parsha of Bilaam...\", while the other proofs don't mention the name of the parsha?

This introduction was composed when the balance of the text had been essentially completed.</p>\n<p>Beginning in what is listed on Sefaria as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paragraph 34 to the introduction</a>, Rambam explains that essentially with the close of the Talmud Bavli all the laws that are incumbent upon and accepted by all of the Jewish people had been codified. In other words, <em><strong>what we are required to do and what we are prohibited from doing.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Rambam goes on to say in what are listed as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paragraphs 41 and 42 in that same introduction</a> that his intention with the very precise and exacting language of the entire Mishneh Torah is to enumerate those laws.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>the whole scope in pure language and concise style</strong>, so that the Oral Torah be entirely methodical in the mouth of everybody, without query and without repartee, without the contentious thus of one and such of another, <strong>but clear text, cohesive, correct, in harmony with the law</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So your contention that Rambam must be trying to do more than what he states explicitly is his intention with the composition of the Mishneh Torah is not in agreement with his own words.</p>\n<p>As Rambam wrote in his letters, he did not include source citations in the Mishneh Torah generally. Something which he actually had regrets over later in his life after seeing the objections raised by some.</p>\n<p>That means that anything found in the language of the Mishneh Torah itself must be taken as something necessary to know what to do or not do.</p>\n\n\n",

Would this be an impediment to the conversion process? Would it continue to be permissible even after conversion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya and thank you for sharing your question. May it be G-d's will to send a complete and speedy recovery to your Aunt and also to give you peace of mind, tranquility of spirit  and the strength to deal with the challenges facing you at this time.</p>\n<p>You say that you are \"a potential convert\" to Judaism. That means that at this time you are not an actual convert, which would present a whole different set of questions. (<em>It is worth emphasizing that even in a Jewish home, caring for a convalescent non-Jew is not something forbidden.</em>)</p>\n<p>It seems fitting that you should consider the first chapter of the book of Ruth, verses 4 through 8; Ruth whose descendants would give rise to the house of King David. Ruth at that point was also not Jewish. But was praised by her Jewish mother-in-law, Naomi for her kindness both in regard to her dead son and toward her.</p>\n<p>In general, in Mishnah Peah 1:1 it emphasizes those actions which have no (limiting) measure and includes acts of kindness among them.</p>\n<p>In Avot 1:2, Rabbi Shimon HaTzaddik teaches that the (whole) world stands on three things. One of those three is acts of kindness.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Sukkah 49b brings the words of Rabbi Elazar who teaches:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Acts of kindness, are greater than charity, as it is stated: “Sow to yourselves according to charity, and reap according to kindness” (Hosea 10:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All these things are definitely Jewish teaching but are clearly not confined to Jews or the Jewish world. They apply to everyone and in all places.</p>\n<p>Your home, if you are single at this time and raising your child, is not a Jewish home. So put that concern out of your mind.</p>\n<p>There are no restrictions upon you in any way at this time from caring for your Aunt in her convalescence. On the contrary, it is in your merit and demonstrates that you are a kind individual.</p>\n<p>Even if you are in the process of study that will potentially lead to your conversion, that doesn't have to happen by any specific due date. G-d is in control of the world and also your life and the circumstances around it.

These matters have been spread to the furthermost islands to many stubborn-hearted nations.

The Mashiach has already come and revealed those hidden truths.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is referring to the Christian claim that the commandments either no longer apply or were not meant literally, specifically as a result of a claimed Messiah (Jesus).</p>\n<p>In fact, in the original Hebrew, Maimonides writes להחליף התורה.

But unfortunately they have multiple \"truths\" that they've come to believe, and then feel a need to re-insert those \"truths\" into the text.</p>\n<p>Most of the time the changes they make to the Hebrew Bible is to insert Jesus places, or add comments or doctrines that reflect Jesus or Trinity, even when the text doesn't really support it.</p>\n<p>Some of the time there are other theological \"truths\" Christians have come to believe that they re-insert into the Hebrew Bible. Such as their belief in Lucifer and therefore inserting the name Lucifer into Isiah 14:12. They've similarly taken the virgin birth concept of the Christian Scriptures and mistranslated it into the Hebrew bible. Even more vague concepts such as Christianity's opposition to abortion leads them to mistranslate Exodus 21:22-23.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day I believe Christians always want to understand the truth of the Hebrew Bible. But Christians aren't taught to realize that \"the truth,\" doesn't exist. Hebrew as a language is word poor, which means words often have various meanings. So it's a rare event that a verse in the Hebrew Bible has only \"one true meaning.\" Instead, there are often multiple truths to every verse, which is why we encourage people to learn and read Hebrew directly rather than rely on translation. But because Christians insist that they can derive \"one true meaning\" of the text in translation, they usually make the mistake of inserting \"their truth\" into the Hebrew text, even when it doesn't belong there.</p>\n\n\n",

He asks how it was possible that the students of R' Akiva, who motto was \"love your fellow as yourself\", could lack kavod for each other? It happened to be that R' Akiva's teachings were extremely personalized to each student, and when the students compared what they had learned, they thought their colleagues had learned incorrectly, not like the halachah! That being the case, it was davka because of their feeling of \"love your fellow as yourself\" that they felt they needed to educate their fellows to understand the Truth; but either side couldn't be swayed in their conviction. Therefore, they couldn't give each other kavod.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Talmud [Yevamot 62b] says that the 24,000 students died of askerah, which Rashi interprets to be diphtheria [on Shabbat 33a].  The Maharal adds that the disease blocked the power of speech, a punishment he deems fitting to the crime.  The Midrash adds that they practiced stinginess [of spirit]. [Bereshit Rabbah 61:3] They felt that another student’s success in Torah study diminished them. [Sifsei Chayyim 3, 44-48].  I don't believe the sources are more specific than that.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore a Niddah when she looks in a mirror there will be found an impression of blood there, as brought (in the books).  Now know, the Segular for Ayin haRa is the fin of a fish, to make it smoke.  The proof is SNPIR (400) is gematria R'A 'AIN (270+130)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שיחות הר\"ן - אות רמב\n<br>\nאָמַר: עִנְיַן <strong>עַיִן הָרָע</strong> הוּא כִּי יֵשׁ כּחַ מַמָּשׁ בְּהָרְאִיָּה\nכִּי כּחַ הָרְאוּת הוֹלֵךְ לַחֲבֵרוֹ וּמַזִּיקוֹ כְּשֶׁעֵינוֹ רָעָה כִּי הָרְאִיָּה הִיא כּחַ מַמָּשׁ שֶׁהוֹלֵךְ כּחַ הָרְאוּת וּפוֹגֵעַ  בְּהַדָּבָר הַנִּרְאֶה וּכְשֶׁעֵינוֹ רָעָה מַזִּיק בִּרְאִיָּתוֹ מַמָּשׁ כַּנַּ\"ל\nוְעַל כֵּן נִדָּה כְּשֶׁתִּסְתַּכֵּל בַּמַּרְאָה יִמָּצֵא שָׁם רשֶׁם דָּם כַּמּוּבָא\nוְדַע שֶׁסְּגֻלָּה לְעַיִן הָרָע סְנַפִּיר שֶׁל דָּג לְעַשֵּׁן בוֹ\nוְסִימָן סְנַפִּיר בְּגִימַטְרִיָּא רַע עַיִן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's more mesugal is SNPIR of a fish called Shlayyin, which sounds like \"Shel Ayin.\"  Also I heard in his name, his memory is blessed, a different wording:\nHang that fin on that man or child who sometimes has Ayin haRa.  Hang that fin on him and he'll be saved, as mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבְיוֹתֵר מְסֻגָּל סְנַפִּיר שֶׁל מִן דָּגִים שֶׁקּוֹרִין אוֹתוֹ שְׁלְעַיֶין לָשׁוֹן נוֹפֵל עַל לָשׁוֹן, שֶׁל עַיִן\nעוֹד שָׁמַעְתִּי בִּשְׁמוֹ זִכְרוֹנוֹ לִבְרָכָה, נסַּח אַחֵר\nלִתְלוֹת הַסְּנַפִּיר הַנַּ\"ל עַל הָאָדָם אוֹ תִּינוֹק שֶׁמֻּרְגָּל שֶׁיִּהְיֶה לוֹ לִפְעָמִים עַיִן הָרָע, יִתְלוּ עָלָיו סְנַפִּיר הַנַּ\"ל וְיִנָּצֵל כַּנַּ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now he also told me more at that time.  He said Ayin haRa is drawn from the 400 men going with Esau to wage war with Yaakob, as it's written, \"And four hundred men with him,\" and it's commented (in the Zohar etc.) that they came to cast Ayin haRa, God save us, on Yaakob's camp.  And SNPIR is 400, numerical to RA AIN, as we've related above.  So all this is against these 400 men of Esau, from whom Ayin haRa derives as mentioned.  Therefore SNPIR delivers from this, as mentioned. And he made consideration of several more things that add up to 400, that pertain to this matter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְסִפֵּר לִי עוֹד שֶׁאָז אָמַר שֶׁעַיִן הָרָע נִמְשָׁךְ מֵהָאַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת אִישׁ שֶׁהָלְכוּ עִם עֵשָׂו לְהִלָּחֵם עִם יַעֲקב\nכְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב \"וְאַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת אִישׁ עִמּוֹ\"\nוְאִיתָא שֶׁהָלְכוּ לְהָטִיל עַיִן רָעָה חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, בַּמַּחֲנֶה שֶׁל יַעֲקב\nוּסְנַפִּיר הוּא מִסְפַּר אַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת שֶׁהוּא מִסְפַּר רַע עַיִן בִּמְכֻוָּן כַּנַּ\"ל\nוְכָל זֶה הוּא כְּנֶגֶד הָאַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת אִישׁ שֶׁל עֵשָׂו הַנַּ\"ל\nשֶׁמֵּהֶם נִמְשָׁךְ הָרַע עַיִן כַּנַּ\"ל\nוְעַל כֵּן סְנַפִּיר מַצִּיל מִזֶּה כַּנַּ\"ל\nוְעוֹד חָשַׁב אָז כַּמָּה דְבָרִים שֶׁעוֹלִים אַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת שֶׁהֵם שַׁיָּכִים לְעִנְיָן זֶה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This option, though, is not given for other offerings, and yet those same people would have the same financial limitation. Would they then not be allowed to atone for other sins or satisfy other sacrificial obligations?</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 14:21</a> (regarding a metzora/leper), the text again discusses someone of limited means. One who can't afford 2 lambs (as per pasuk 10) can bring one lamb and 2 birds. But while the text acknowledges that someone might not have money, and includes the variable notion when making the offering, there is no option for \"only flour\" (at least to replace the animal part of the offering).</p>\n<p>How does the poor person satisfy his various obligations if there is no \"flour only\" option and why doesn't the text offer the same option for the poor man as it does in those limited cases in perek 5 in other situations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>They're not entirely identical -- earlier in Leviticus, the <em>atonement</em> for a handful of sins requires a sacrifice, and there are options from livestock to birds to flour.</p>\n<p>Here we are dealing with those who have become impure due to various weird bodily things, and the sacrifice is needed for them to be fully pure enough to allow regular access to the Temple. Note that those who became impure due to bodily functions require some amount of blood when they're finished! Something's going on there.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I suspect there are more options in the \"sinner\" category because if someone is thinking about admitting that (for example) he swore falsely when he was supposed to testify, we want to make the atonement process easier.

From the opening mishnah, as well as a beraita cited in the Gemara, it seems that R. Eliezer agrees with you that there is no problem with saying morid hageshem all year round.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאימתימזכירין גבורות גשמים רבי אליעזר אומר מיום טוב הראשון של חג ר' יהושע אומר מיום טוב האחרון של חג אמר לו ר' יהושע הואיל ואין הגשמים אלא סימן קללה בחג למה הוא מזכיר אמר לו ר' אליעזר אף אני לא אמרתי לשאול אלא להזכיר משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם בעונתו אמר לו א\"כ לעולם יהא מזכיר</p>\n<p>WHEN DO WE [BEGIN TO] MAKE MENTION OF THE POWER OF RAIN? R.\nELIEZER SAYS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST. R. JOSHUA SAYS: ON THE LAST\nDAY OF THE FEAST. R. JOSHUA SAID TO HIM: SEEING THAT RAIN ON THE FEAST IS A\nSIGN OF [GOD'S] ANGER WHY MAKE MENTION OF IT? THEREUPON R. ELIEZER SAID\nTO HIM: I ALSO DID NOT SAY TO PRAY4 BUT TO MAKE MENTION [IN THE WORD] ‘HE\nCAUSETH THE WIND TO BLOW AND THE RAIN TO FALL’ -IN ITS DUE SEASON. HE [R.\nJOSHUA] REPLIED TO HIM: IF THAT IS SO ONE SHOULD AT ALL TIMES MAKE\nMENTION OF IT.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Taanith.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>, capitals in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לו ר' יהושע והלא גשמים בחג אינו אלא סימן קללה אמר לו ר' אליעזר אף אני לא אמרתי לשאול אלא להזכיר וכשם שתחיית המתים מזכיר כל השנה כולה ואינה אלא בזמנה כך מזכירים גבורות גשמים כל השנה ואינן אלא בזמנן לפיכך אם בא להזכיר כל השנה כולה מזכיר</p>\n<p>R. Joshua said to him: Is not rain on the Feast a sure sign of [God's] anger? R. Eliezer replied:\nI too did not say to pray but to make mention. And just as one makes mention of the Revival of the\nDead all the year round11 although it will take place only in its proper time, so too should mention be\nmade of the Power of Rain all the year round although it comes only in its due season. Therefore if\none desires to make mention all the year round he may do so.</p>\n<p>(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Talmud immediately proceeds to record the opinion of Rebbe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי אומר אומר אני משעה שמפסיק לשאלה כך מפסיק להזכרה</p>\n<p>Rabbi says: I hold the view that when\none ceases to pray [for rain] one should also no longer make mention of it.</p>\n<p>(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this opinion, praising God for rain is fundamentally linked with asking God for rain. Rashi there explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בימות החמה אינו מזכיר הואיל ואין זמנו</p>\n<p>In the summer months we do not mention [rain] since it is not its time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eventually the Talmud presents the final ruling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר חנינא הלכך בימות החמה אמר משיב הרוח אין מחזירין אותו אמר מוריד הגשם מחזירין אותו בימות הגשמים לא אמר משיב הרוח אין מחזירין אותו לא אמר מוריד הגשם מחזירין אותו</p>\n<p>R. Hanina said: Therefore, if in the summer one inserted [in the Tefillah the words], ‘He\ncauseth the wind to blow’, he is not compelled to repeat [the Tefillah]; if, however, he said, ‘He\ncauseth the rain to fall’, he is compelled to repeat [it].</p>\n<p>(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we conclude that saying morid hageshem all year round actually invalidates the prayer. Here Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפי שהגשמים בקיץ סימן קללה הן מפני הקציר</p>\n<p>For rain in the summer is a sign of curse on account of the harvest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This apparently harks back to the debate between R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua, with the conclusion that rain at the wrong time is bad, and thus it should not be mentioned during the times when its presence would be bad. As explained by Tosafot on the mishnah, R. Eliezer does not care about \"a sign of curse\" (which is why he allows morid hageshem all year round). But the Talmud's conclusion (which is followed in the codes) apparently follows the view that we do care about \"a sign of curse\".</p>\n\n\n",

Which was considered superior?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>From what I've read, there are a lot of disagreements among both rabbis and academics about what the exact role of the Knesset Hagedolah was, particularly in light of the Sanhedrin/Beit Din Hagadol (Great Court) (for example, both the Torah says that there need to be 71 sages (Moshe and seventy elders) and we know that that's how the Sanhedrin was structured, but there were 120 men in the Knesset Hagedolah). There are also disagreements about the exact structure and authority of the Sanhedrin, in light of sources that use similar terms to seemingly describe completely contrasting things (for example, the priestly Sanhedrin described by Josephus, when we know there were also non-priests in the Sanhedrin<sup>1</sup>).<sup>2</sup> It's my understanding that there's no definitive answer at the moment for your question, but I can present some different views on the subject.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaaqov_Medan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Medan</a> in his essay in Hebrew \"<a href=\"http://www.herzog.ac.il/vtc/tvunot/mega14_medan.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction To C. Chefetz's Essay On the Persian and Median Empire</a>\", pg. 76, Megadim 14, brought two views about the Knesset Hagedolah:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Goren\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Goren</a> in Torat Ha'Moadim opined that the Knesset Hagedolah was comprised of three courts: The Great Court of 71 men, and two secondary courts, of 23 men each (see for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.1.6?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 1:6</a>). This brings us to 117 men, and adding to them the prophets Chaggai, Zechariah and Malachi, we get 120 men.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>While accepting that Rabbi Goren's idea of the structure of the Knesset made most sense, Rabbi Medan himself believed that the number 120 was never thought of as a must for a high spiritual and judicial leadership institution. Rather, Chazal concluded that the Knesset Hagedolah itself <em>happened</em> to be made up of 120 men, based on the number of elders that appear in Ezra and Nechemiah, together with Chaggai, Zechariah, Malachi and Shimon Hatzaddik (or variant possibilities, such as Daniel, Mishael, Azaryah and Chanayah).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A third view, brought by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuvein_Margolies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Reuven Margolies</a> in his book \"The Basis of the Mishna and its Editing Process\" (יסוד המשנה ועריכתה), 4th edition<sup>3</sup>, pg. 38-39 says that when the central court was being established in the time of Ezra and Nechemiah, the sages were unable to decide who would sit on the court and who wouldn't, so they decided to put everyone who was fit for the role (which happened to be 120 men), and waited until 49 passed away, thus returning to the customary number of 71. Only from then on, when an elder died or was unable to continue in his post, he was replaced by another elder. In his view, this is also the meaning of the term \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שיירי כנסת הגדולה</a>\" - from the moment that the first of the 120 elders passed away, the Knesset was now the \"remainder\" of the Knesset. This judicial body continued to exist for a couple of centuries until eventually becoming known as the \"Sanhedrin\" (the Aramean-Grecian term for the Great Beit Din). Interestingly, Rabbi Margolies <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32665&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thought</a> that the three things that the Knesset taught over in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 1:1</a> was a mirroring of the three tasks given to Ezra by King Artaxerxes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.7.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 7:25</a>).</p>\n<p>These three views more or less agree that the Knesset Hagedolah was the Sanhedrin of its time, the difference being what was the meaning of 120 elders as opposed to 71. However, there's another view:</p>\n<p>The fourth view is by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_HaLevi_Herzog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Halevi Hertzog</a>, who wrote in his essay \"Historical Notes On The Halachot of the Sanhedrin\", pt. 2, pg. 393-394, Sinai 3:5 that the Knesset Hagedolah was higher in rank than the Sanhedrin, and had different duties. Its duties comprised less of judicial decisions and more of spiritual ones, such as making sure Torah was being taught among Yisrael, creating fences around the Torah (סייג, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 1:1</a>), organizing the structure of prayer, and so forth. According to Rabbi Hertzog, the reason they were comprised of 120 elders was because 120 equals 12 times 10, and 10 is an edah (עדה, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.21b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 21b</a>). Each unit of ten men, each edah, symbolized one of the twelve tribes. He notes that though tribal mentality and awareness was considerably less significant during the Second Temple period, it still existed to a certain extent. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Arakhin.32b.15-33a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arachin 32b-33a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.36a.14?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfot in Gittin 36a</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.6.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 6:17</a>.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Seemingly in agreement with Rabbi Hertzog's view (though not stated explicitly), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Leib_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehudah Leib Maimon</a> wrote in the book \"Mazkeret - In memory of Rabbi Yitzchak Halevi Hertzog\", pg. 566, that the Knesset was a council created to oversee the aliyah during Shivat Tzion. It was first headed by Zerubavel and Yehoshua ben Yehotzadak. The council's duties included maintaining contact with the communities that remained in the diaspora, supplying those that made aliyah with \"silver, gold, goods, and livestock\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 1:4</a>) and were in charge of all spiritual and physical matters pertaining to the olim. Rabbi Maimon, however, disagrees on the reasoning for there being 120 men. In his view, the council started out with the first 9-12 leaders of the aliyah, then expanded to include all of the heads of the families, which is why it is stated in some sources that they amounted to 85 men (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.6b.3?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Megillah 6b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ruth_Rabbah.4.5?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruth Rabbah 4:5</a>) (in Nechemiah 10, 83 are listed, to which Chaggai and Zechariah are probable additions and Malachi was probably Ezra). Finally, the number expanded to 120 to reflect the ties of the council with the Jews in all 120 states in the Medo-Persian empire (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Daniel.6.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 6:2</a>).</p>\n<p>Side-note: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Finkelstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eliezer Finkelstein</a>, who mentioned Rabbi Hertzog's view in his book \"The Pharisees and the Men of the Great Synagogue\", points out that the word \"edah\" during the Second Temple period and afterwards, was synonymous with \"knesset\", \"beit din\" (court) and \"sanhedri\", comparing sources such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sotah.7.8?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sotah 7:8</a> with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Makkot.4.6?vhe=Tosefta_Makkot_-_Machon_Mamre&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Makot 4:6</a> (the chazan of the knesset is the chazan of the court), and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.469.15?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni 469:15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bamidbar_Rabbah.16.21?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 16:21</a> (edah equals beit din and sanhedri), so this strengthens Rabbi Hertzog's view that there's a connection between the edah, the Sanhedrin, the court and the Knesset Hagedolah.</p>\n<p>Finkelstein himself believed that the Knesset Hagedolah was some sort of central court, higher than the other courts/sanhedrins of the time, but still very much in charge of judicial rulings (unlike Rabbi Hertzog's position).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Zion_Melamed\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Prof. Ezra Tzion Melamed</a> in his book \"An Introduction to Talmudic Literature\", pg. 44-45 and footnote 43, opined that the Knesset was the Sanhedrin of its time.

Genesis Rabbah 23:3 identifies Naamah, the daughter of Lemech and sister\nof Tubal-cain (Gen. 4:22), as Noah's wife.  Another doesn’t state whose wife she is. As of her character? According to the Rabbis, Naamah was Noah’s wife; as her name indicates, her actions were pleasing (ne’imim—Gen. Rabbah 23:3). According to another view, however, she acted improperly, for she beat on a drum and drew people to engage in idolatry, and her musical activity increased corruption among people. This tradition is apparently connected with a different interpretation of the name Naamah, from ne’imah (melody and song) (Targum Pseudo-Jonathan on Gen. 4:22).  There does not seem to be singularity on whether Naamah was Noach’s wife, one of his son’s wives, or simply mother of the neflim and temptress of the fallen angels. In the instance of her being Noach’s wife (or that of one of his sons), there are portrayals of her being both wholesome and evil.</p>\n<p>Sefer haYashar and Genesis Rabba both agree that Noah's wife was called Naamah. According to the latter, she was the sister of Tubal-cain (Genesis 4:21); according to the former, she was a daughter of Enoch, and Noah married her when he was 498 years old. The 17th-century theologian John Gill mentioned a theory which identified Naamah instead with the name of the wife of Ham, son of Noah, who he believed may have become confused with Noah's wife.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The meaning of Yaldah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are several terms in the bible that indicate \"children\": <em>zehrah, bakar, yanek, gamul, taph, 'owlel, elem, naar, yathowm,</em> etc. Does the term \"Yaldah\" in the bible mean <em>child</em> (minor) or <em>girl</em>? It is used only three times in the bible and according to \"Gesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon\" the meaning is as follows:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Bi6lB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Bi6lB.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>According to the Jastrow dictionary, Yaldah means \"child\" only in rabbinic literature, and not in the Bible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fmVvV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fmVvV.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Does the meaning of Yaldah in Biblical usage mean child? What do you think about it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This question is predicated on a misunderstanding of the way that Jastrow's dictionary is organized. To point out the flaw in the reasoning, in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%99%D6%B6%D7%9C%D6%B6%D7%93.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">same entry</a> depicted above, Jastrow writes that \"yeled\" is a masculine Biblical Hebrew word (for that is what the letters \"b.h.\" mean in the entry) meaning \"child, young man\" but does not give examples from verses where this is so, such as Genesis 21:14 for the yeled who accompanied Avraham, or Exodus 2:3 when Moshe is placed in the basket on the Nile.</p>\n<p>Yet, he is not thereby declaring that \"yeled\" doesn't mean child / young man in Biblical Hebrew. It is simply that his is a dictionary of Rabbinic literature, and so his examples all stem from Rabbinic literature.</p>\n<p>When Jastrow transitions to mentioning that there feminine form is \"yaldah\", he does not say that this is non-Biblical Hebrew, or Chaldean (that is, Aramaic). He is continuing his earlier explanation, showing the feminine form.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the claim that \"yaldah\" means ungendered child is a difficult one to make, and one unlikely that Jastrow would have made. Generally speaking in Hebrew, masculine is the default, and so could be employed for both male and neutral genders. By way of analogy, in English, you would say \"actor\" and nowadays this could encompass both male and female actors. But, you would never write \"actress\" to encompass male actors or non-gender specific actors. Jastrow explicitly puts the gender-neutral \"child\" with the Biblical Hebrew \"yeled\" at the top of the entry, and does not put it there in the middle for the feminine form. Indeed, he seems to be saying explicitly the opposite of the idea that you are trying to advance and read into his words.</p>\n\n\n",

IIRC, the reason to prefer heter mechira over importing from outside of Israel was because it's a mitzvah to eat the holy shmita produce (according to Ramban, hasagos al sefer hamitzvos, third mitzvas aseh).</p>\n<p>I remember being puzzled by this at the time. One basic premise of the heter mechira is that land owned by non-Jews in Israel lacks (full) kedusha and therefore there is no prohibition of shmita (like Rav Yosef Karo's opinion, which is followed by \"minhag yerushalayim.\") That's why selling to a non-Jew would help at all.\nSo to the extent that the produce has no shmita sanctity, how can there be a mitzvah to eat it?</p>\n<p>Therefore I would like to clarify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Did Rabbi Aviner actually make this claim? Is there a copy of his drasha available including this specific claim?</li>\n<li>Are there legitimate halachic opinions which say that the mitzvah of eating shmita produce (according to the Ramban) applies even to produce from non-jews, ven according to the Rav Yosef Karo's position in which are treated as if they lack sanctity? (Of course, according to Mabit that non-jewish produce is still kadosh, the mitzvah would apply. I'm asking specifically according to the Beis Yosef.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Another possibility- perhaps Rabbi Aviner is assuming that the sale doesn't really work to actually make it owned by non-jews, and thus it still remains with the original kedusha; and yet the heter mechira would still be valid as a rabbinic \"fake sale\" or ha'arama)?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Update: <a href=\"http://harova.org/emitzion/tevet5768.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> is the article that I remembered seeing. In it he is clearly advocating relying on heter mechira as the proper course and obligatory, not just as a leniency.</p>\n<p>At the end when discussing not buying from outside of Israel, he finishes off by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also learned that there is holiness in the fruit of the Land of\nIsrael (Bach Orach Chaim 208) and even more so in the fruit of the\nseventh year according to the Ramban.\nNotice I did not say that I am\nholy. I am a regular Jew, but if The Holy One, Blessed be He, decreed that when I act like a regular Jew and when I eat fruit of our Holy\nLand, I absorb holiness within me – this is His will and I am happy to\nperform His will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is true that he is not addressing the \"mitzvah\" of eating fruit, but rather that there is holiness in the fruit. The Ramban says that the mitzvah is to eat the holy fruit.\nHowever, The question still remains- what is the source to say that the fruit which grew in a non-jewish field still (according to Rav Yosef Karo) has the kedushas shviis?</p>\n\n\n",

The Human consisting of a body that is subject to desires and sin and a spiritual part which is more or less capable to counter those tendencies and a soul in between for humans to choose which side they want to incline towards.</p>\n<p>While reading it occured to me that this view might not fit very well into how the Torah portraits humans. For one, Bereshit 2:7 says, that humans did not get a nephesh, they became a living nephesh when G-d breathed his nshamah into him. In 9:4 it says, that blood is the sign of the nephesh (so not a completely spiritual/invisible thing) and contrary to the greek idea, a nephesh can be both alive (Bereshit 2:7) and dead (Vayiqra 21:11) and therefore is (or seems to be) not eternal as the greeks understood it. And besides the nephesh, we also have G-ds ru'ach in us (Bereshit 6:3), which we can apparently loose (and die), but e.g. Iyyobh 4:9, 27:3, 32:8 suggest that they (ru'ach & nephesh) both convey the same idea or concept. Maybe the heart fits better into the role of deciding whether to follow G-ds commands or our own desires (e.g. Mishlei 16:9, 19:3, 20:9 in contrast to the Shema Yisrael)?</p>\n<p>And we haven't even touched the spiritual part (which provides the will to follow G-d). Is it something in us? Or is it just by studying the Torah that our desires somehow change? What about Yehezqiel 36:26-27? Is the heart the thing that provides the will?</p>\n<p>As you might have guessed by now I'm currently not quite grasping how the Tanakh understands humans and have a difficult time to wrap my head around this different mode of thinking about this topic. I would be thankfull for any attempt to clarify the different roles of the different aspects or parts of a human being.</p>\n<p>Also feel free to add some more tags, I didn't find any that seemed to fit.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a very complex topic about which books have been written, but I'll try my best to give a quick introduction. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that in Hebrew some words can be used both broadly and narrowly, so context matters.</p>\n<p>There are three words for the soul that can be used somewhat interchangeably: Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshamah. All three are related to the concept of breath or blowing. Nefesh usually is considered the lowest form of the soul: the basic life force that keeps people or animals alive. Thus it is used in Genesis to refer to animals too. As you point out, there are verses that specifically connect the Nefesh with the blood.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.21.11?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Leviticus.21.11.2&lang2=he&w2=Mizrachi&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra</a>, Nefesh is used to refer to a dead body to teach that the minimum amount of blood necessary to keep someone alive also transmits impurity the same as a corpse. As the Mizrachi explains, since a <em>revi'is</em> of blood is the amount that maintains the Nefesh, the term Nefesh can also apply to a <em>revi'is</em> of blood.</p>\n<p>The Lev or heart sometimes refers to the intellect, but it also often refers to human desires. In the Shma, we are warned not to stray after our hearts. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.39?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Torah_Temimah_on_Torah%2C_Numbers.15.39.14&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Sages</a> interpreted that as referring both to physical desire and idolatrous thoughts. The verses in Ezekiel prophecy that at a later date G-d will purify us of our physical desires, allowing us to focus more on spiritual matters.</p>\n<p>As to how all this fits with Greek philosophy, an introduction to the topic can come from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Ramban_on_Genesis.2.7.1&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nachmanides</a>'s commentary to the first mention of soul in the Bible.

He first has Tzidkiyahu claiming that Michayhu's prophecy had to be false because it apparently contradicted Eliyahu's earlier prophecy about the dogs licking up Achav's blood in Yizre'el, a good distance from Ramos Gilead.** Then he continues that Tzidkiyahu issued a challenge: just as Yeravam's hand froze when he tried to hit the prophet Iddo, so too, if Michayhu is a genuine prophet, the same should happen when Tzidkiyahu lifts his hand to strike Michayhu - and that didn't happen.</p>\n<p>* Not noted in the article, but the Gemara (Sanhedrin 89a) seems to imply that Tzidkiyah was indeed a genuine navi, and was just misled by the \"spirit of Navos\" into giving a false prophecy.</p>\n<p>** In the event, of course, both came true: see 22:38 and commentaries there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><sup>Note: I would still like a good answer based on the traditional reading and interpretation of the text (though the sources need not necessarily be traditional themselves).

This was probably still the case when the story was inserted into the work that would eventually become known as Sefer Melachim, but a later redactor<sup>2</sup> changed the names of the kings involved, likely - according to Baruchi - to associate all three Aram-Yisrael wars described in the cycle with the prophecy made regarding Achav's death (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.21.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:21:19</a>, cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.22.38?vhe=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:22:38</a>), demonstrating its fulfillment.</p>\n<p>The details that point to this possibility are the fact that in some of the Aram-Yisrael stories there are central characters strangely left unnamed: An unnamed king of Aram (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.22.3?vhe=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:22:3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.22.31?vhe=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">31</a>), an unnamed king of Yisrael (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.22.2-38?vhe=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:22:2-38</a>), and an unnamed prophet (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.20.13-14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:20:13-14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.20.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.20.28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">28</a>).</p>\n<p>Per this explanation, we understand why the king of Yehudah didn't intervene when Michayhu was punished - because Achazyahu was not a righteous king.

I found a class by Rav Medan on the subject of the Two Yeshayahus, but a few minutes into the class he mentioned this and again said that this particular point can easily be disproven, but stated that that should be an entire class in itself and so there, too, he didn't expand on the issue. I was unable to find any class of his that discusses this particular issue (there might be one, but I don't know).</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any idea what he could have meant by this statement?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Saying brocho in modern restroom\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been going through the <em>Mishna Berura</em> on saying <em>shma</em> in restrooms (מ״ב סימנים פ״א-פ״ז so far) and I'm rather curious what the <em>halacha</em> is relating to modern restrooms. (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4491/praying-in-a-restroom\">This question</a> only discussed restrooms generally). The entire discussion seems to revolve around (a) odor and (b) the visible presence of feces. For this question please assume there is <strong>no odor</strong> in the room, as that significantly simplifies things.</p>\n<p>Lets break this into two use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Residential restrooms</strong> – Modern restrooms with indoor plumbing removes the vast majority of the feces immediately, with minimal to no residue. Additionally, nearly all residential toilets come with a cover that can immediately cover up any remaining feces.</li>\n<li><strong>Public restrooms</strong> (the clean ones) – The actual toilets are in their own cubicles and use high-powered flushing mechanisms to remove nearly all waste, again with minimal to no residue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MB פ״ז:א:א-ו discusses whether one can say <em>shma</em> near a chamber pot (I believe) and seems to suggest (פ״ז:א:א) that the only issue is the smell. The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> in פז:ב suggests that \"<em>yesh osrim v'yesh matirim v'halacha k'divrei ha osrim</em>\", but the MB mainly points out (פ״ז:ב:ח) that the smell is the issue. For public restrooms, there's a discussion which I didn't entirely follow in the following <em>se'if</em> on cubicles, which seems to hinge on whether they reach the ground, which may make entire classes of restrooms OK for saying a <em>brocho</em> when near the sinks...? This is particularly relevant for people using the restrooms for something other than relieving oneself (e.g., taking drink of water, only washing <em>netilas yadayim</em>, etc).</p>\n<p>Curious to hear what modern <em>poskim</em> have suggested about this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Hargasha nowdays",
    "content": "# Hargasha nowdays\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are various reasons that the Poskim nowadays give to explain that there still is a concept of Nidda Min Hatorah despite women not having a Hargasha. From what I have managed to see, there seem to be three approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Aruch Hashulchan writes that a woman has Hargosho but doesn't recognise it.</li>\n<li>An approach based on the Sidrei Tahara that Hargasha is an indicator that the dam came from the mekor.</li>\n<li>Tumas Nidda was based on what is normal: Then, it was Hargasha; now, it is Derech Reiya.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have found all these approaches very hard to understand. It would seem that when a woman does a Bedika, we are suddenly concerned that she may have had a Hargosha. If so, why do Kesamim not create such a concern for hargasha, as there is no minimum limit for Dam with Hargasha (possibly one needs a minimum of two drops  - Bach 183)?</p>\n<p>Could it be that Nidda nowadays is only Miderabnan? This would seem to be the simplest approach but no one seems to want to go with this approach.</p>\n<p>Or one could learn the other way based on the Aruch Hashulchan and make the novel suggestion that nowadays there is no Hilchos Kesomim as we say that we are always concerned that a woman had a Hargasha but she didn't feel it just as we say when a woman does a Bedika that it is a Sfeika De'oirayso? R' Moshe explains the Aruch HaShulchan that this was only said by a woman getting her regular period but we are not concerned in that way in the case of a Kesem. So the question I had on it is: Why are we concerned that a woman had a Hargasha when she does a Bedika then?</p>\n<p>Is there another approach to explain this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that each of the three approaches you mention will answer your question differently.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Hargoshos Still Exist:</strong></p>\n<p>This mehalach holds that there remain hargoshos today. This seems to be the <a href=\"https://www.yoatzot.org/questions-and-answers/965/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reality reported by women</a>. Zivas davar lach, in particular, appears to still be common.</p>\n<p>According to this mehalech, your questions are much weaker. We are choshesh by bedikah because there's no alternative source of the blood--it is a vadai from the uterus--and she may have been margash. It is one safek d'oraysa.</p>\n<p>By a kesem, there was no hargasha and it isn't for sure from the mekor. It is a sfek sfeka. Moreover there isn't a known basis for why she would have missed the hargasha.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Hargosho is Lav Davka, the Key is Whether it Came From the Uterus</strong></p>\n<p>The Sidrei Tahara (and Tosafos Niddah 3a, DH: V'Ha Ika) holds that hargosho creates a certainty that the blood came from the uterus. But if we would have other means to establish the same certainty, she would be tamei m'd'oraysa.</p>\n<p>According to this mehalach as well, your questions are answered. A bedika--with an ed boduk--creates the same level of knowledge that the blood came from the mekor as a hargasha. And since tipas dam is enough, she is tamei vadai.</p>\n<p>A kesem on the other hand is a safek, did it come from her or did it come from elsewhere. And the Torah only prohibited a niddah vadai, not a nidda safek (according to the Sidrei Tahara).</p>\n<p><strong>3. The Key is Derech Reiya--Whether Through Hargosho in Talmudic Times or a Regular Flow in Modern Times.</strong></p>\n<p>According to this mehalech (R' Ovadia Yosef?), the halacha of hargasha is that niddah is only tamei d'oraysa if it is the normal way of seeing a period.</p>\n<p>A kesem is still not the ordinary way of seeing a period, so it remains a gezeirah. But what about a Bedikah? How is a Bedikah the ordinary way of seeing a period.</p>\n<p>I think the answer might be because halacha requires bedikos around the time of a woman's period. Because a woman is bodek during her vest and in the periods after her period, it is a normal way that a woman sees period blood just like seeing a regular flow is normal. So she saw blood that is for sure from the mekor and it is normal way of seeing dam nidda--tamei.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I concur with others who have written that hargasha exists nowadays as well. As far as I know all women are aware when they are having a period. Women also commonly find discharges in their underwear without having been aware of anything previously, and that is a kesem. How exactly to treat all the cases in between is a question which I won't get into.</p>\n<p>The real difficulty is why we treat things differently when there is a Bedika. The Rambam (Issurei Biah 9:1) actually answers this question explicitly, writing that any blood found internally is assumed to have come with hargasha. However, this answer is difficult conceptually and also seems to contradict the gemara in Niddah 57b, which states that liability to bring a korban after finding blood on a cloth following relations is contingent on hargasha (and even then, in some circumstances we are concerned that this hargasha may have been imagined because of the feeling of the cloth).</p>\n<p>I prefer to say that blood found on a bedika cloth is different to other kesamim on a rabbinic level only. The whole purpose of bedika is a safeguard to a severe transgression, and as such no leniencies were given. I am aware that this contradicts the Shulchan Aruch, who rules that blood found on a bedika cloth also counts as a standard emmission of blood regarding the laws of vesatot (YD 190:54).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>I am afraid all the poskim are mistaken. Hargosho is nothing to what they say it is. The pardes rimonim asks if the rechem is open why doesnt it all come out at once why take five or more days. He answers niflaos haborai. Other poskim ask similar questions with similar replies. The truth is they have no idea of how niddah works.So let me explain my understanding of it having looked at the internet. Goyim are also niddos and no different to Jewish ones. I know I am coming very strongly on this going against all poskim something  I being orthodox would never usually do. But this is a grave issur kores d'orayse so I have to make an exception.</p>\n<p>First let me say how a child is concieved. The rechem is always open, the opening gets bigger during niddos and child birth.\nWhen a man has intercourse part of his zera goes into the rechem and up the fallopian tube where if it meets the womans zera a child gets born there. It stays there slowly going down into the rechem where it eat the dam. If no child then there is a chemical in the womans zera which causes the dam. Now how does the dam come out.</p>\n<p>Unlike what the poskim think it just doesnt come out when the 'door' is open. The door is open all the time. The dam is enclosed in some kind of 'case' and has to be squeezed out through a cramp or spasm. The dam cannot otherwise come out and this is what hargosho is. The chasam sofer writes that if a woman puts her mind to it she can feel it and the internet also says the woman also feels it however slight.</p>\n<p>I am in no sofek that the poskim are all wrong and this is the correct hargosho.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I will add a few things. We know that there are heterim , less than a gris and coloured clothes.\nThis is wrong. There is no heterim for real niddah. The reason for the heter is only if there is no hargosho where it is only an issur drabonon. For an issur d'orayso there is no heter. It is not that the woman decides which kind of an issur it is. But like I have written and am sure about, without this spasm it cannot be dam nidda.But comes from a different place. Nidda can only come with a spasm and if there is none it is only drabonon and heterim apply.</p>\n<p>I should add that in my opinion a woman who never feels this spasm has no heter whatsoever because maybe she had one. Only a woman who always feels the spasm can have the heter when there isnt one for less than a gris or coloured clothes. I should also add that a kalla teacher should be teaching a girl what hargosho is.The spasm is on a special part of the body and like the chasam sofer says one can be trained to feel it. I think that is all. If I am mistaken about the metsius I would very much like to be put right.</p>\n\n\n",

And what is the difference between the two in the context of Bilam?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>That Bilam was a prophet is stated in a number of sources, such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.15b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Batra 15b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...

The Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.106a.17?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 106a</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is stated: “And Balaam, son of Beor, the diviner, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain” (Joshua 13:22). The Gemara asks: Was he a diviner? He is a prophet. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Initially he was a prophet, but ultimately, he lost his capacity for prophecy and remained merely a diviner. Rav Pappa says that this is in accordance with the adage that people say: This woman was descended from princes and rulers, and was licentious with carpenters.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Me'am Loez on Bamidbar 22:5 writes (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...and at the time Balak came to know Bilam as a soothsayer and great diviner, for at the time he prophecised to him that he would become king.</p>\n<p>And some say that for this reason that city was called P'torah, because Bilam at first solved dreams (poter), and afterwards became a diviner, and after that rose in level in that the holy spirit rested upon him and he would prophecise things of prophecy...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, Me'am Loez writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And at first Balak and Bilam attempted to work different sorts of enchantments against Yisrael. And upon seeing that these enchaments had no power against Yisrael, they went to curse...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that Bilam was both a prophet, a diviner and a magician. A prophet recieves his abilities from Hashem. A diviner, as explained by Me'am Loez, doesn't receive his abilities from Hashem. And magic, as outlined in the portion of the Me'am Loez that I didn't quote, comes from dark forces of impurity. Bilam attempted to use all of his abilities against Yisrael, and failed with all of them, save for his eventual advice to cause Yisrael to sin with Ba'al Pe'or.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Metzudat David on Nechemiah 6:12\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was debating with a chavruta today how to understand the following explanation from Metzudat David. The verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.6.12?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Nehemiah.6.12.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechemiah 6:12</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then I realized that it was not God who sent him, but that he uttered that prophecy about me—Tobiah and Sanballat having hired him.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question the commentaries attempt to answer is: How did Nechemiah figure out that Shema'ayah was being paid by Tovia and Sanbalat?</p>\n<p>Metzudat David wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כי הנבואה. כי אמר אשר הנבואה דבר עלי ללכת אל ההיכל והנה הרבה ריוח והצלה לפניו ומדוע א״כ יצוה לעבור מצותו כי אם אמרו מדעתו היה מקום לומר מפני פיקוח נפש הותר הדבר אבל ה׳ לא יצוה כזאת ובזה הכרתי שאין עצתו אמונה רק טוביה או סנבלט שכרו להכשיל אותי בעצתו.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"that prophecy. For he said, the prophecy he spoke to me to go to the sanctuary, for after all, there is much providence before Him, and if so, why would He command to desecrate His commandment, and if he said it from himself, there was room to say that because it is necessary for saving a life, it is allowed, but Hashem would not command so, and through this I realized that his advice is not trustworthy but that he was being paid by Tovia or Sanbalat to trick me through his advice.\"</p>\n<p>I understood the M\"D to be saying that Nechemiah thought there were two options: Either Hashem would speak through one of his prophets, Shema'ayah in this case, and tell Nechemiah not to be afraid, or Shema'ayah would tell him: \"Here's <em>my</em> advice: since this is a case of pikuach nefesh, you should go hide in the sanctuary of the Temple, where none but the kohanim are allowed.\" According to Nechemiah, the combination of seemingly Hashem having said through Shema'ayah that he should go hide in the Temple because it's pikuach nefesh and therefore, as a one-time thing, is allowed - was impossible, because Hashem Himself would not command a desecration of the Torah, even to save a life (rather, He would save Nechemiah some other way, as He has no shortage of ways to do so).</p>\n<p>From this I gathered that any hora'at sha'ah, at least according to M\"D, comes solely from the prophet himself and not commanded by Hashem. My friend disagreed with me. He thought there's no way that a prophet can command a hora'at sha'ah from himself, but rather, that it must come from Hashem. He doesn't know, however, how to explain the Metzudat David.</p>\n<p>What's the correct understanding of the Metzudat David?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Sion Qadosh's Ohr La'Yesharim (p. 391) explains the Mesudath Dawid as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלומר נחמיה הפעיל את ההיגיון השכלי שלא יתכן שה' יצוה לעבור עבירה כשיש\nאפשרויות אחרות ומכאן אתה למד שכל המייעץ דברים הנוגדים את ההלכה או\nאפילו דברים שאין השכל מחייב אין לקבל את הדברים ויש לחקור אחר המייעץ אם\nאינו מנביאי השקר של דורנו והבא להיטהר מסייעין בידו</p>\n<p>Which is to say, Nehemiah intellectually reasoned that it is not\npossible for God to command a transgression when there are other\npossibilities, and from this you learn that anyone who advises things\nthat are contrary to Halakhah or even [contrary to] things that the\nmind does not compel, these things should not be accepted and one\nshould investigate whether the advisor is not one of the false\nprophets of our generation and the one who comes purify will be\nassisted in his pursuit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to R. Qadosh's reading, it is due to the fact that Nehemiah had other avenues of pursuit that would not have incurred a violation of the prohibition of a <em>zar</em> (non-Kohen) entering the <em>Heikhal</em> (Sanctuary). If it were indeed the only option, presumably it would have been permitted (hora'ath sha'ah/piquah nefesh). Since it was not the only option, he understood that Shema'ayah was a false prophet.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that it makes more sense that a hora'as sha'ah must come from Hashem, because what is special about a Navi that allows him to decide on his own? In this case, Nechemiah already knew that there were people trying to discourage him from rebuilding Jerusalem, so he was suspicious of these so-called prophets. He reasoned that it is much more likely that they are trying to mislead him than having real prophecy, because it is <em>highly unlikely</em> that Hashem would tell him to do an aveirah for purely practical reasons.</p>\n\n\n",

Check out I Samuel 8:11--17, and backing up to Deuteronomy, it says the king can't amass \"too much gold and silver, or too many horses\" -- which means he has the power to amass <em>some.</em> The Jewish Bible was generally concerned with Jewish governments.</p>\n<p>The broader formulation of \"the law of the kingdom is the law\" (<em>dina demalchuta dina</em>) is described as such by the Talmudic sage Shmuel, who lived around the year 200. The Talmud thus says that if there is a reasonably-fair system of taxation and consistently following its laws, the tax collectors take your ox and then later say \"oops, you overpaid, here's your refund -- take this lamb\" -- the lamb is not \"stolen goods\" and you're free to use it normally.</p>\n<p>This appears not to be the rabbis coming along and decreeing something new (e.g. \"the Torah prohibited kindling fire on Sabbath, we will tell you not to carry matches so you don't space out and use them\"), but rather their understanding of Biblical law -- but the particular formulation of \"the law of the kingdom is the law\" wasn't written down as such until the year 200ish. (They had also previously dealt with corrupt, self-appointed tax collectors and ruled that Jewish law per se did not obligate obedience to such ruffians.)</p>\n<p>\"Megillah\", literally, is a scroll of the Book of Esther; in this context, we are referring to the book of the Talmud (the Talmud is divided into lots of books); in this case, the story was included in the final edition of the Babylonian Talmud, so it was written sometime before the year 500 or so.</p>\n<p>The criterion of using currency as a determination of a government's legitimacy per se appears to have been developed by consensus by rabbis in the <em>Gaonic</em> period, so probably between 700 and 1000. Maimonides then included it in his code, which was written around the year 1200 (he died in 1204).</p>\n<p>Mind you, currency is <em>a criterion</em> that was suggested for use in determining if a government was legitimate, especially when there's a coup or junta or whatnot. If a new boss shows up in town and no one is interested in his fiat currency, that means he's not really a government. Presumably it is not the only possible way to be a legitimate government. Millions of Ecuadorians today happily consider themselves Ecuadorian, vote in Ecuadorian elections, pay taxes to and receive services\nfrom the Ecuadorian government -- it just happens to be that Ecuador uses US Dollars.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The story is Megillah 14b -- David has been anointed king and perhaps could claim to be so <em>de jure</em>, but <em>de facto</em>, Saul still occupies the throne. Here's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.14b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria's text and translation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מוֹרֵד בַּמַּלְכוּת הוּא וְלָא צְרִיךְ לְמֵידַּיְינֵיהּ אָמְרָה לוֹ עֲדַיִין שָׁאוּל קַיָּים וְלֹא יָצָא טִבְעֲךָ בָּעוֹלָם אָמַר לָהּ בָּרוּךְ טַעְמֵךְ וּבְרוּכָה אָתְּ אֲשֶׁר כְּלִיתִנִי [הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה] מִבֹּא בְדָמִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nabal, your husband, is a rebel against the throne, as David had already been anointed as king by the prophet Samuel, and Nabal refused his orders. And therefore there is no need to try him, as a rebel is not accorded the ordinary prescriptions governing judicial proceedings. Abigail said to him: You lack the authority to act in this manner, as Saul is still alive. He is the king in actual practice, and your seal [tivakha] has not yet spread across the world, i.e., your kingship is not yet known to all. Therefore, you are not authorized to try someone for rebelling against the monarchy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word seen here is <em>teva</em>, which is \"nature\", but it appears others did have the reading <em>matbea</em>, coin.</p>\n<p>As for halachic literature -- the real government is the one whose coin is used -- see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Robbery_and_Lost_Property.5.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides' Laws of Loss and Theft Chapter 5</a>, where he addresses government's legitimate right to tax. (I've excerpted and translated my own here; see Sefaria's link for full text and their translation.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה,יא  [יב] וכן מלך שהשים מס על בני העיר, או על כל איש ואיש, דבר קצוב משנה לשנה, או על כל שדה ושדה דבר קצוב, ... וכל כיוצא בדברים אלו--אינו גוזל, וישראל שגבה אותן למלך אינו בחזקת גזלן, והרי הוא כשר:  והוא שלא יוסיף ולא ישנה כלום, ולא ייקח לעצמו כלום.\n...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה,יד  לפיכך גבאי המלך ושוטריו שמוכרים השדות במס הקצוב על השדות, ממכרן ממכר....</p>\n<p>ה,יז  מלך שכרת אילנות של בעלי בתים, ועשה מהן גשר--מותר לעבור עליו; וכן\nאם הרס בתים, ועשה אותן דרך או חומה--מותר ליהנות בה.  וכן כל כיוצא בזה,\nשדין המלך דין....</p>\n<p>ה,יח  במה דברים אמורים, במלך שמטבעו יוצא באותן הארצות, שהרי הסכימו\nעליו בני אותה הארץ, וסמכה דעתן שהוא אדוניהם והם לו עבדים.  אבל אם אין\nמטבעו יוצא, הרי הוא כגזלן בעל זרוע, וכמו חבורת ליסטים המזויינין, שאין\nדיניהן דין; וכן מלך זה וכל עבדיו, כגזלן לכל דבר.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a king who taxes the city or all the people, a fixed amount from year to year, or fixed amount per field ... and the like -- is not stealing, and a Jew collecting these sums for the king is considered \"kosher\" and not a thief, provided the tax collector not add, modify, or take some more for himself. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore the king's collectors and officers who sell fields that were collected as part of the tax, their sale is valid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a king cut down citizens' trees to make a bridge, the bridge may be used; or tore down houses to build a road or wall -- these items may be used, or anything like this. As the law of the king is the law...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>When was this said? Regarding a king whose coin circulates in those lands, as the people of that land have agreed upon him and accepted him as their master and they be his subjects. But if this king's coin does not circulate, he is just a strong-armed robber, like a band of armed bandits -- their law is not the law! In this case this king and his servants would be treated like thieves.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

These authorities reason that such a relatively large quantity is not required when using whiskey for kiddush because it is simply not the normal manner or quantity in which one normally drinks such beverages.[Taz O.C. 190 & 210:1] These highly alcoholic beverages are normally enjoyed 1-2 oz. at a time and served in what are known as “shot glasses”. Since this is the normal manner in which these drinks are consumed, one would be permitted to recite the Shabbat day kiddush upon them in this way.[Maharsham 1:175, Minchat Yitzchak 10:22] In fact, one who treats a shot of whiskey as if it were a kiddush-sized serving of wine may be required to recite a “borei nefashot” after drinking even this small amount.[Har Tzvi O.C. 159]</p>\n<p>Some suggest that the practice of reciting kiddush over a shot of\nalcohol evolved due to the scarcity and expense of wine in certain\nparts of Europe.[Mishna Berura 272:29] Since the situation has changed, many authorities\nassert that we should revert to the practice of making kiddush\nexclusively upon wine.[Shevet Halevi 5:32] Nevertheless, the custom of using chamar\nmedina for kiddush is a strong one, not likely to ever disappear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashbam in pesachim 107a explains that chamar Midina is only when there's no wine in the city.

Even after bringing the bidieved defence for it, says that it's still a mitzva min hamuvchar to use wine...\nThe Mishna brura holds that even if you use chamar midina you should fill up a cup that can contain a riviis. Shabbos day one can rely that its 3 oz. And you should drink a malei lugmav which is more than half a riviis, which in this case would be 1.6 oz.</p>\n\n\n",

Our author uses a parable to demonstrate this point, writing that when a wise woman wishes to rebuke her daughter-in-law for something both she and her daughter had been guilty of, she rebukes only her daughter instead, allowing her daughter-in-law to draw the necessary conclusions about her own behaviour. If G-d had rebuked Avraham in Sarah’s presence, he would have felt ashamed; He therefore did so in an indirect manner.

I remember Rav Moshe Shapiro zatza\"l saying a similar idea.)</p>\n<p>Then, after we have the general point- avoid sin by keeping the \"big picture\" in mind- we can discuss the specifics of each questions.\nBN</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>There is a sicha of the Rebbe on pirkei Avos to that chapter which says that the 3 clauses speak to 3 classes of people.</p>\n<p>First it just says \"reflect upon 3 things\", without saying what they are.</p>\n<p>This is said in regards to tzadikim. In general a Mishnah can include many ideas with a short language. When it says you reflect upon 3 things, it means to reflect upon \"things that are 3\", such as the third Beis Hamikdash, the third redemption, etc. etc. (And that will automatically cause one to not even come to the \"hands\" of a sin, since Tzadikim don't need to be told how to distance from sin itself, but even the possibility of sin, the \"hands\", one will be removed from)</p>\n<p>Next \"know from where (אין) you came\", etc is speaking to beinoni, the middle man, who needs things spelled out for him a little more, telling them that they came from the level of אין, nothingness that's beyond revelation.</p>\n<p>Similarly \"and where (לאן) you are going\", that you are going to the level of אן, 50+1, even beyond the 50th gate of understanding.</p>\n<p>\"And before who (מי) you are destined to give an accounting\", the level of \"who\", מי, is kesser, corresponding to the 50th gate\n(Not sure exactly why this would be less than the earlier level, so it requires further research)</p>\n<p>Then the next part of the Mishnah specifies everything, for one who is on a lower level of one who is a rasha, has no open connection etc , one needs to speak with harsh words of musar to get him to listen etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2865567/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Related</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a letter of the Chazon Ish where he says that sometimes the Mishnah would use extra words to make the Mishnayos easier to remember. I think that reasoning applies especially to Pirkei Avos, due to its ethical message. So the Mishna is written in a style more similar to a speaker: eye-catching headline, then a list of the three things, then an explanation of how they work. The repetition helps cement the concepts in the listener's mind.</p>\n<p>(I don't think it is online and I don't have the sefer personally, so I can't post a link.)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, in many <em>minhag Ashkenaz</em> communities, verses 2–4 of Psalm 118 are said only by the <em>ḥazzan</em>, and the <em>ḳahal</em> repeats verse 1 after each recitation (see for example the Koren <em>minhag Ashkenaz</em> siddur); in some Yemenite and Sepharadi communities, the <em>ḳahal</em> says הללו יה after almost every half verse of Hallel, and otherwise says almost none of Hallel (see for example <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3lSziPnhT0oYzY3Mzg3MWEtZWUwMS00MzY0LWIxY2ItODg0ZDk3YmFjNzM3/view?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and Tiklal Tefillat Kol Peh); and there are other <em>minhagim</em>.</p>\n<p>If you are not with the <em>ḳahal</em> for Hallel (on the days when even an individual says <em>Hallel</em>), you obviously do not do the call and response, but say all of Hallel yourself. I am wondering about the in-between situation, where you arrive join the <em>ḳahal</em> late, when they've already started saying Hallel. In this situation, if you catch up silently to the <em>ḳahal</em>, can you then join in the call and response (and not actually say several verses of Hallel), or since you started as an individual, must you finish as an individual? Does it matter when you arrived and caught up, eg. if you only missed the <em>ḥazzan</em>'s blessing, but none of Hallel, or you only missed a section that doesn't have any call and reponse?</p>\n\n\n",

They made it a law that a certain tree, the <em>asherah</em>, should be worshipped, and that of its fruit one part should be offered, and the rest consumed in the temple of the idol: this is stated in the regulations concerning the asherah. In the same manner, they made it a rule, that the first-fruit of every fruit-tree should be partly offered as a sacrifice and partly consumed in the idol's temple. It was also a widespread belief that if the first-fruit of any tree was not treated in this manner, the tree would dry up, its fruit would be cast off, its increase would be diminished, or some disease would come over it; just as they spread the belief that every child, that was not passed through the fire, must die. People in their anxiety for their property obeyed also this precept unhesitatingly. The Law, in opposition to this doctrine, commanded us to burn the produce of fruit-trees the first three years; for some trees bear fruit after one year, whilst some begin to yield fruit after two, and others after three years. The law is based upon the nature of trees grown in an ordinary way, namely, in one of the three well-known methods: planting, propagation, and inoculation (<em>neti‘ah</em>, <em>habrakah</em>, and <em>harcabah</em>). The Law does not take notice of the case that a kernel or stone is sown; for the ordinances of the Law are based on the usual condition of things, and as a rule a young tree in Palestine bears fruit for the first time not later than the third year after it has been planted. According to the divine promise, the waste and destruction of this first-fruit of the tree will be followed by years of plenty of fruit; for it is said, \"that it may increase unto you the fruit thereof\" (Lev. xix. 25). The fruit of the fourth year we are commanded to eat before God, instead of [the heathen custom of] eating ‘orlab, \"the fruit of the preceding years,\" in the temples of the idols, as has been described by us.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp173.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The law concerning the fruit of a tree in its fourth year has some relation to idolatrous customs, as has been stated by us (chap. xxxvii.), and is connected with the law concerning the fruit of a tree in its first three years. But it has in addition the same object as the law concerning the heave-offering (Deut. xviii. 4), the dough-offering (<em>ḥallah</em>) (Num. xv. 20), the first-fruit (Exod. xxiii. 19), and the first of the shearing (Deut. xviii. 4). For the first of everything is to be devoted to the Lord; and by doing so man accustoms himself to be liberal, and to limit his appetite for eating and his desire for property.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp175.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.2.28-34?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Kings 2 (28 -34)</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have a partial answer to this question:</p>\n<p>A number of commentators point out that the place Yoav escaped to wasn't where the Ark was located in Yerushalayim, but to the Mishkan in Givon:</p>\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.1.50?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_I_Kings.1.50.1&lang2=bi&w2=Midrash&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:50</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Of the horns [of the corners] of the Altar. Which was in Givon. He said, “Those who are executed by Beis Din are buried in the graves of Beis Din. I will die here, and be buried in the graves of my forefathers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this is referring to Adoniyah, Rashi quoted in his commentary something <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Masei.12.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the midrash</a> attributed to <em>Yoav</em>. From this one can understand that the midrash, which spoke about Yoav's escape, speaks about him escaping to the altar in Givon (per <a href=\"https://xn--febl3a.co.il/929/289/3261\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eitan Shendorfi</a>).</p>\n<p>Ritva on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Makkot.12a.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&p2=Ritva_on_Makkot.12a.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makot 12a</a> also says that the altar Yoav escaped to was the one in Givon.</p>\n<p>R' Tzvi Binyamin Wolf in his book \"Melachim According To The Mesorah\" notes that in \"Ohel Hashem\" in Yerushalayim there wasn't the altar built by Moshe, because that was in Givon, and in the bamah there weren't \"horns\" on the altar that had any halachic significance (meaning, there might have been horns, but they weren't an integral part of the alter, thus, it would be meaningless to grab onto them). For these reasons, it seems more likely that Yoav fled to the altar in Givon.</p>\n<p>This is a significant point, because the Ark was never in Givon (among sources, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Zevahim.13.8?vhe=Tosefta_Zevachim_-_Machon_Mamre&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Zevachim 13:8</a> which says that in in a big bamah there wasn't the Ark and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.3.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:3:4</a> it says that the big bamah was in Givon and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.17b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Megillah 17b</a> which says that when the Mishhkan was in Givon, the Ark was in Kiryat Ye'arim (and see <a href=\"https://www.temple.org.il/single-post/2018/03/18/-d7-92-d7-91-d7-a2-d7-95-d7-9f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well)). Therefore, there was only the danger of making the altar impure and not the Ark.</p>\n<p>As for the altar, it seems the altar wasn't in any danger of becoming impure, because the mishna in Chagigah 3:8 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All the vessels that were in the Temple required immersion after the Festival, apart from the golden altar and the bronze altar, because they are considered like the ground and therefore, like land itself, not susceptible to impurity. This is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: It is because they are coated.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the altar in Givon was a copper coated altar, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zevachim.61b.6?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 61b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rav Huna says that Rav says: The altar in Shiloh was fashioned of stones. This is as it is taught in a baraita: Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: Why must the verses state that the altar must be fashioned from stones (Exodus 20:22), and state again that the altar must be fashioned from stones (Deuteronomy 27:5), and mention yet again the word stones (Deuteronomy 27:6), with regard to the altar, for a total of three times? These allude to three different stone altars: One in Shiloh, and one in Nov and Gibeon, and one in the Eternal House, i.e., the Temple...Rav Huna stated his opinion in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Natan, as it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Natan says: The altar in Shiloh was fashioned of copper; it was hollow and full of stones.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, as stated in the beginning, this is only a partial answer, because it doesn't explain the view of the commentators that believed that Yoav fled specifically to where both the altar and the Ark were located (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.2.28?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_I_Kings.2.28.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudat David</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.2.34?lang=bi&p2=Abarbanel_on_I_Kings.2.34.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.2.34?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_I_Kings.2.34.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Makkot.12a.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>, despite what he appears to have concluded from Tanchuma (not that this isn't the first time that Rashi contradicts himself)).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=7065\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Medan</a> maintains that Benayahu first pulled Yoav away from the altar and then killed him, which may explain the view of these commentators.</p>\n<p>Another suggestion, brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Makkot.7a.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Makot 7a</a>, is that Yoav escaped to the vicinity of the altar, but not to the altar itself. Rather, he went to the Sanhedrin which communed near the altar. According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.48b.12?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfot</a>, this is one way to also understand the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.48b.12-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 48b</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The altar that Yoav held on to was the altar in the courtyard, not the altar inside the tent itself.</p>\n<p>Why, then, did it mention that he ran away to the \"tent\"? See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.2.28?with=Malbim&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> there, that this alludes to one of the three mistakes Yoav made in thinking that he could not be killed while holding the altar, that he didn't realize that this protection is only provided in the permanent temple.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחז\"ל אמרו שטעה ג' טעיות. ...  ב. שאין קולט רק בית עולמים, ועז\"א אל אהל ה',</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Could someone point me to Orthodox sources in the ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataphatic_theology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cataphatic</a>’ tradition - i.e. those who claim that Hashem may be known ‘positively’ (which is to say, known in the proper sense of the term)?</p>\n<p>Many thanks for your time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>“R.

All the sources quoted in previous answers maintain the apophatic understanding of Judaism. And while there are descriptions of G-d that are similar to how humans are described and which therefore sound cataphatic, they are not actually descriptions of G-d's essence but rather of the systems he uses to run the world. As explained by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Da%27at_Tevunoth.144?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramchal</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And do not understand when we said that the Holy One blessed is He is merciful, to say that his essence may He be blessed according to himself is such, like we would say about a person that there is this quality in his soul to be merciful - that it is so impressed upon his temperament, that it will be grasped and its matter understood from it even from one aspect G-d forbid, for this we should not think at all, for it is impossible to know from His matters may He be blessed, that which He is to himself in truth at all. But when we call him merciful, we understand that he desires in one characteristic, which is the characteristic of mercy, a character which is not according to he Himself, but is according to the values of the creations and measured in their measurements. But since he wants this, and he wants to be understood in this way, we call him by this name - merciful. But his complete and straight essence is certainly outside of all these matters. And this is the faith that we are obligated to believe in may He be blessed with certainty, as we explained above already.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much of the early opposition to Kabbalah came from those who did not realize the Kabbalists made this distinction. However, over time, that misconception was corrected.</p>\n<p>I will add some important quotations from one of the most authoritative works of Jewish philosophy, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_First_Treatise_on_Unity.10.70?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Duties of the Heart</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We ascribe to Him Eternity (no beginning), because rational arguments have demonstrated that the world must have a First (cause) which had no previous cause before it and a Beginning which had no prior beginning. It has been demonstrated that the number of causes cannot be infinite. It logically follows, that the Creator is the First Beginning before whom there is no Beginning, and this is what is meant by His Eternity, as written: \"From everlasting to everlasting, You are G-d\" (Ps. 90:2), and \"before Me there was no god formed, neither shall any be after Me\" (Isaiah 43:10).\nRegarding declaring of Him that He is One, we have already sufficiently demonstrated this by well known arguments and it has been established by clear evidence, that true Unity is inseparable from His glorious essence. This unity implies absence of plurality in His Being, the absence of change, transformation, incident, origin or destruction, joining or removal, comparison or association or any other properties of things that are plural.\n<strong>It is necessary for you to understand that these attributes do not imply any kind of change in His glorious essence, but only to denote a negation of their opposite. What the attribution of them should convey in our minds is that the Creator of the world is neither plural, nor non-existent, nor created.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This plurality in the Creator's attributes does not, however, exist in His glorious essence but is due to inadequacy of language on the part of the speaker to express the conception in one term. You must understand that, regarding the Creator, there is none like Him, and whatever attributes we speak of regarding Him, you are to infer from them the denial of their opposite. As Aristotle said \"negating attributes of G-d gives a truer conception of Him than affirming attributes\"</strong>. For all affirmative attributes ascribed to G-d must necessarily ascribe properties of Etzem (essence) or Mikre (incidental properties), and He who created etzem and mikre has not the properties of His creatures in His glorious essence. But the denial of such properties to Him is undoubtedly true and appropriate to Him. For He is above all attributes and forms, similarity or comparison. <strong>Therefore, you must understand from these attributes that they refer to the negation of their opposites.</strong></p>\n<p>A certain person led the prayer service before Rabbi Chanina and said: \"the great, the mighty, the awesome, the powerful, the glorious, the potent, the feared, the strong, the powerful, the certain, and the esteemed G-d!\". R' Chanina waited until he finished. When he finished, R' Chanina said to him: \"did you complete all the praises of your Master? What need is there for all of this? even us, these three praises that we say (in the daily prayers), if not for the fact that Moshe Rabeinu said it in the Torah (Deut. 10:17), and the men of the great assembly came and established it in prayer, we wouldn't be able to say them! And you say all these praises and continue? It is analogous to a king of flesh and blood who had thousands upon thousands of golden coins, and they would praise him for possessing silver coins, isn't this a disgrace to him\"?\n62And \"to You silence is praise\" (Ps. 65:2), to which our teachers said: \"the best potion is silence, the more you praise a flawless pearl, the more you depreciate it\" (Megila 18a).\n63<strong>Therefore, you should exert your mind until you know the Creator through the evidences of His works and not strive to know Him in His glorious essence. For He is exceedingly close to you from the side of His deeds but infinitely remote in any representation of His essence or comparison with it. As already stated, we will never be able to find Him in this way.</strong> When you arrive at the stage where you abandon (trying to find Him) through your thoughts and senses because He cannot be grasped in this way, and you instead find Him in the evidence of His deeds, as though He were inseparable from you - this is the pinnacle of knowledge of Him which the prophet exhorts us on in saying \"Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the L-ord He is G-d in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else\" (Deut. 4:39).\n64One of the Sages said: \"the more one increases knowledge of the Creator, the more one is awe-struck with regard to His nature\".\n65<strong>Others said: \"the truly wise person in the knowledge of G-d realizes his ignorance regarding His glorious essence while the ignorant person thinks that he understands G-d's glorious essence.\".</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The pinnacle of knowing Him is to reach the stage where you admit and believe that you are completely ignorant of the truth of His glorious essence.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Rambam’s approach is similar to Rav Saadia’s, except that he writes (Moreh Nevuchim 1:64) that the phrase “Kevod Hashem” is a synonym; it could refer to either Hashem Himself, in all His glory, or it could be used to refer to the kavod nivra.

However, in Moshe’s later request, he was asking to see Hashem Himself, which is why he was unable to have his desire granted.</p>\n<p>Rav Sa’adia Gaon writes that the shechinah is indeed part of the physical world, but that it is a kavod nivra. In fact, Rav Sa’adia Gaon holds that the term “shechinah” refers to any miraculous thing that reminds the viewer that Hashem is shochein beqirbo, dwelling with him. Thus, the pillars of fire and of cloud were the shechinah, as were the vision of Mount Sinai and of the Merkavah. Rav Sa’adia Gaon’s notion of kavod nivra can be a physical object. Therefore this vision could occur through regular, physical sight.</p>\n<p>This is where the Rambam’s opinion diverges. He holds (Moreh Nevuchim 2:6) that the kavod nivrah could only be seen prophetically. It is different in kind to the pillars of fire and of smoke, which were physical entities created miraculously.</p>\n<p>The Ramban disagrees with both. In our verse, the Ramban says that “Sh-echinah” is a name of Hashem, not a created thing (nor a class of them). However, this does not mean that Mosheh and the elders actually saw Hashem in human form. The Ramban on our verse explains that the vision was prophetic. To the Ramban, nevu'ah is a message, and the things \"seen\" in it are symbols in that message, not (as the Rambam would have it) the experience of metaphysical existences. This is what frees him up to saying that the Sh-echinah can really be G-d Himself even though it is seen in prophecy.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to understand \"If a thief steals from a friend and modifies the object...\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an episode of \"<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtisel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shtisel</a></em>\" there is a scene where a Rabbi quizzes a Yeshiva applicant about the halacha (I think he says it is in Eruvin) \"If a thief steals from a friend and modifies (the object) then he owns it. The show only gives the start of the student's answer.</p>\n<p>Now maybe this is completely made up for the TV show, and maybe I just mis-understood the question.  But if the statement is even a little accurate, then I'd like somebody to explain what the halacha is, because it seems not to make sense.  What if I steal Ploni's wagon with the intent to pad the seats, and then I pad them (making an improvement) so I own it?  How is that right?</p>\n<p>Now if the Gemorrah (or Mishna) says he owns it and has to pay compensation \"from the best of his property\" (as in some cases in Bava Kama) then it makes more sense.  But to just keep it does not make sense to me.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The question is whether the original item must be \"expunged\" as-is, or whether simply the value has to be paid back. So the thief isn't gaining either way!</p>\n<p>As you suggested -- yes, if you modified the item, you keep the item, but instead have to pay back more. The dialogue in the TV show is saying that it still doesn't seem fair that this item per se can stick around -- effectively the thief bought it at 100% markup, without asking the owner.</p>\n<p>If I steal a block of wood worth $100 and the block is still sitting in my house, I'm obligated to return the said block, plus $100. Whereas if I stole that block and then turned it into a chair, I pay back $200. It's a more fair way, when you think about it -- otherwise we'd have to start figuring out the value of the chair now ... did your work mean you now have to pay less than $200 ... effectively ... but the critical point is that the verse reads <em>veheshiv es hagzela asher gazal</em> -- he shall return the stolen thing <em>he stole</em>, which the Talmud (Bava Kamma 94a) interprets as \"ka'asher gazal\" -- <em>as it was stolen</em>, i.e. the obligation to expunge the item itself, as-is, is only if it's in the original condition.</p>\n<p>This is pretty clear in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Robbery_and_Lost_Property.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides' Robbery & Lost Property 1:5.</a> And for lots more, it's the opening subject of the Talmud's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.93b.1-18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama Chapter 9</a>. (The chapter is literally known as <em>one who robs wood</em> because it opens with <em>one who robs wood but then carves it into implements should simply return the original value</em>)</p>\n<p>(Footnote: okay if you robbed it in broad daylight by force, you'd just pay back the original or its value. The penalty of an added 100% is if you snuck into their house or pickpocketed them. The main points are the same.)</p>\n<p>(Double footnote: the question of literal expungement after modification, vs. restitution, came up with Swiss banks that received blocks of dental gold from Nazi Germany. For bonus points, check out <em>Naska DeRav Papa</em> -- items made of precious metals are considered \"changed\" if molten down, but blocks of precious metals are not considered \"changed\" if molded into something, as it's easily molten back to a plain old block.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler gives an explanation for it, given in that link.<br />\nOne can suggest a slightly different explanation: Say Reuven sneers at Shimon for something he did wrong, and scoffs that he himself did the same thing right. So what is happening is that Shimon is suffering for the sin he did - and Reuven is enjoying Shimon's sin. Shimon is <em>also</em> suffering for the mitzvah Reuven did, and Reuven is using it to enjoy himself at Shimon's expense. לפום צערא אגרא - the reward for a mitzvah is for the difficulty it involved. Thus, here Shimon deserves to be rewarded for Reuven's mitzvah - which caused him suffering, and conversely Reuven deserves to be punished for Shimon's sin.</p>\n\n\n",

Would love a source if this is the case.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The prohibition of embarrassing someone applies in private too. However, the specific punishment of losing the portion in the world to come is only for public embarrassment.</p>\n<p>The Rambam (Deos 6:8) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המוכיח את חבירו תחלה לא ידבר לו קשות עד שיכלימנו שנאמר ולא תשא עליו\nחטא כך אמרו חכמים יכול אתה מוכיחו ופניו משתנות ת\"ל ולא תשא עליו חטא\n<strong>מכאן שאסור לאדם להכלים את ישראל וכל שכן ברבים</strong> אף על פי שהמכלים את\nחבירו אינו לוקה עליו עון גדול הוא כך אמרו חכמים המלבין פני חבירו ברבים\nאין לו חלק לעולם הבא לפיכך צריך אדם להזהר שלא לבייש חבירו ברבים בין\nקטן בין גדול ולא יקרא לו בשם שהוא בוש ממנו ולא יספר לפניו דבר שהוא בוש\nממנו</p>\n<p>He who rebukes a friend, at the beginning, no hard words should be\nused against him to shame him, for it is said: \"And thou shalt bear no\nsin upon him\" (Lev. 19.17). Thus did the wise men say: \"Understand it\nnot by rebuking him thou mayest cause his countenance to change\nexpression; for, it is said: 'And thou shalt bear no sin upon him'\"\n(Ibid.; Arakin, 16b); <strong>herefrom we learn that it is forbidden to put an\nIsraelite to shame, needless to say publicly.</strong> Although he who does put\nhis fellow to shame is not flogged, it is a grievous sin. Even so did\nthe wise men say: \"He who publicly puts his fellow's countenance to\nshame has no share in the world to come\" (Pirke Abot, 3.15). A man is,\ntherefore obliged to guard himself against putting his fellow to shame\npublicly, regardless of whether he be young or old; not to call him by\na name of which he feels ashamed, nor tell aught in his presence of\nwhich he is ashamed. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam clearly explains the prohibition in general terms, and further extrapolates the severity of doing so publicly.</p>\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim (Pesicha, Laavin 14) codifies this prohibition, and highlights the difference between private and public shaming:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאִם גִּנָּהוּ כָּל כָּךְ בַּדְּבָרִים הַנַּ\"ל וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶם\nבְּפָנָיו וּבִפְנֵי אֲחֵרִים, עַד שֶׁנִּשְׁתַּנָּה פָּנָיו עַל\nיְדֵי זֶה, עוֹבֵר גַּם כֵּן עַל לָאו (ויקרא י\"ט י\"ז) דְּ\"לֹא תִשָּׂא\nעָלָיו חֵטְא\" שֶׁהִזְהִירָה הַתּוֹרָה בָּזֶה, <strong>שֶׁלֹּא לְבַיֵּשׁ אֶת\nחֲבֵרוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל אֲפִלּוּ בִּמְקוֹם הַתּוֹכָחָה וּבֵינוֹ לְבֵין\nעַצְמוֹ</strong>, דְּהַיְנוּ שֶּׁלֹּא לְדַבֵּר אִתּוֹ קָשׁוֹת עַד\nשֶׁיַּכְלִימֶנּוּ, <strong>קַל וָחֹמֶר שֶׁלֹּא בִּמְקוֹם הַתּוֹכָחָה וּבִפְנֵי\nאֲחֵרִים.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>וְכָל זֶה שֶּׁלֹּא הָיָה בָּרַבִּים, אֲבָל אִם הִלְבִּין אֶת\nפָּנָיו בָּרַבִּים, כְּבָר כְּרָתוּהוּ רַזַ\"ל מֵעוֹלָם הַבָּא</strong>\nוְאָמְרוּ: הַמַלְבִּין אֶת פְּנֵי חְבֵרוֹ בָּרַבִּים אֵין לוֹ חֵלֶק\nלָעוֹלָם הַבָּא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And if he is one\nof the plain people, who guard themselves against sin, but\noccasionally stumble into it — if the doubt is balanced, he must\nincline it and judge him by the scales of merit, as Chazal have said:\n\"If one judges his friend by the scales of merit, G–d will judge him\nby the scales of merit.\" And this is included in the Blessed One's\nbehest (Vayikra 19:15): \"In [the scales of] righteousness shall you\njudge your fellow.\" And even if the thing seems more inclined to the\nscales of guilt, it is very fitting that he regard it as a doubt and\nnot judge it in the scales of guilt. And when the thing is inclined to\nthe scales of merit, where it is certainly forbidden, according to the\ndin to judge it in the scales of guilt, and he judges it in the scales\nof guilt, as a result of which he goes and demeans him — aside from\ntransgressing \"In righteousness shall you judge your fellow,\" he\ntransgresses further the issur of speaking lashon hara.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In paragraph 8 he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And even when the scales of guilt are more heavily weighted [than\nthose of merit], where, in respect to the din, the issur of judging\nhim in the scales of guilt is not so great — that is in the terms of\nperceiving him as not having acted in accordance with the din — but he\nshould not rush to shame him because of this before others without\nhaving ascertained that this is consistent with all of the\nqualifications listed above in Principles IV and V and in Principle X.\nFor there are many things where even though the din may not be with\nhim, it is still forbidden to shame him because of this, as will be\nclear to those who study these principles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the Be'er Mayim Chaim where the Chofetz chaim brings down his sources and adds some clarification.</p>\n<p>It comes out that there are 3 types of people:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Someone who is known to be a tzaddik (never stumbling) must always be judged favorably, even if it doesn't seem likely at all (as long as there is some possible way to exonerate him.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Someone who is a rasha (known to do wrong things willingly) should be judged negatively; we assume he had negative intentions unless we know otherwise.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Someone who is a beinoni- trying to do good but occasionally messing up: in this case it depends.\nIf the possibilities are balanced- there's a 50/50 chance that he did the right thing or wrong thing- then we need to judge favorably.\nIf it seems likely that the person messed up, then it is proper to avoid deciding definitely that the person messed up; it's better to say \"I don't know what the story is\" but it's not obligatory to avoid passing judgement.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that all of the above refers simply to the question of judging a person's actions favorably or not.

Because of her beauty, she led the sons of Elohim, Aza and <strong>Azael</strong> astray. She bore them all sorts of new kinds of Kelipah. Evil spirits and demons spread out from her into the world. They wander around the world during the night, deriding human beings and causing nocturnal pollution. Wherever they find men sleeping alone in their own homes, they hover over them and cling to them, arousing lustful desires and having offspring by them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>23a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another explanation of \"Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness...\" (Beresheet 1:26) was given by the friends as referring to the ministering angels who spoke this phrase (to Hashem). (R' Shimon) said to them: Since the angels already know the past and the future, they already knew that man was destined to sin. Why then did they want to make man? Not only that, but (the Angels) Aza and <strong>Azael</strong> also opposed (man's creation). When the Shechinah said to the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Let Us make man,\" they responded, \"What is man that You take knowledge of him?\" (Tehilim 144:3). Why do you wish to create man when You know that he shall definitely sin before you, with his wife, who represents darkness, because the light is the male and darkness is the Female principle, the Left, darkness of Creation. At that moment, the Shechinah said to them: You will fall by the same reasoning that you denounce, as it is written: \"That the sons of Elohim saw that the daughters of men were fair\" (Beresheet 6:2), so they went astray after them. And the Shechinah caused them to fall from their holy state. The friends said, Rabbi, Rabbi, Aza and <strong>Azael</strong> did not lie, because Adam definitely was destined to sin by his wife. He replied: This is what the Shechinah said, You, (the aforementioned Angels), have laid accusations before me that go beyond those of all the hosts above. If you were better than man in your actions, you would have had a right to accuse him, but man will sin only with one woman while you are destined to sin with many women. Therefore, your sins are greater than those of human beings, as it is written: \"The sons of Elohim saw the daughters of man.\" It is not written: 'the daughter of men,' but rather \"the daughters of men\". As man sinned, I prepared atonement for him to amend his sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>25a-b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>About the Nefilim (the fallen ones), it is written: \"That the sons of the Elohim saw that the daughters of men were fair\" (Beresheet 6:2). These are the second group (of the erev rav, emanating from the Chochmah of the Kelipot) from those fallen from above, (from Aza and <strong>Azael</strong>, who were angels above. Hashem dropped them out of the heavens). When the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to create man, he said (to the angels) \"Let us make man in our image...\" (Beresheet 1:26). He wanted to make him a leader over all (the angels above), so that he might govern all (the angels) and they would be under his rule, as is written about Joseph: \"And let him appoint officers over the land\" (Beresheet 41:34). Those (Angels) wanted to denounce him. They asked (Hashem), \"What is man, that You are mindful of him\" (Tehilim 8:5), for he is bound to sin before You? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, If you were down below like he, you would sin more than he does. Immediately, \"The sons of the Elohim saw the daughters of men...\" They were filled with passion for them, so the Holy One, blessed be He, dropped them down in chains.\nThese [25b] (i.e. the 'sons of Elohim') are Aza and <strong>Azael</strong>, from whom descended the souls of (the second group in) the mixed multitude, which are the Nefilim. They made themselves fall, and they fornicated with women who were fair. Because of this, the Holy One, blessed be He, also eliminated them from the World to Come, so that they may not have a portion there. And He gave them their reward in this world, as it is written: \"...and repays them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them\" (Devarim 7:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>126a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said to him, Where did Bilaam learn everything that he did and all that he knew? He said to him, He learned it from his father. But in \"the mountains of the east\" (Num. 23:7), in the land of the east, he learned the enchantments and kinds of magic, for in these mountains abide the angels Aza and <strong>Azael</strong>, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, caused to fall from heaven (because they denounced the creation of man). They are tied in chains of iron there and reveal spells to men. This is where Bilaam gained knowledge, as it is written, \"Balak the king of Moab has led me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east\" (Ibid.) (where Aza and <strong>Azael</strong> are).\nHe said to him, It is written, \"He went not, as at other time, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness\" (Num. 24:1). Rabbi Yitzchak said that the lower side, which comes from the unholy spirit above, is the unholy spirit that ruled over the wilderness at the time when the children of Yisrael defiled themselves by committing the sin of the golden calf. He cast his spells to all directions in order to uproot the children of Yisrael, [126b] but could not do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(There might be more occurrences; the translation I searched from here is still in progress:)\n<a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Zohar/Genesis#Bereisheet_/_%D7%91%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%A8%D6%B5%D7%90%D7%A9%D6%B4%D7%81%D7%99%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Zohar/Genesis#Bereisheet_/_%D7%91%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%A8%D6%B5%D7%90%D7%A9%D6%B4%D7%81%D7%99%D7%AA</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Occurrences of Azazel:</p>\n<p>142b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice...\" (Beresheet 27:8): It was then Pesach (Passover) eve, and the Evil Inclination had to be exterminated from the world, and the moon, the secret [142b] of faith had to govern. Therefore, Rivkah cooked two dishes.\nRabbi Yehuda said that this alludes to the descendants of Jacob, who in the future offered two goats on Yom Kippur, one for Hashem and one to <strong>Azazel</strong>. For this reason, Rivkah offered \"two kids of the goats,\" one for the supernal grade and one to subjugate the grade of Esau, so he would not rule over Jacob. Thus, there were two kids of the goats. From both, Isaac tasted and ate. It is written, \"and he brought him wine, and he drank\" (Beresheet 27: 25), (not 'he served him'). By this he hints that he served him wine from afar. According to Rabbi Elazar, this means that he brought him wine in which there is complete joy, to gladden Isaac, for he needed cheering, as the side of the Levites needs cheering, Therefore, \"he brought him wine, and he drank.\" \"And Rivkah took the best clothes of her eldest son Esau\" (Beresheet 27:15). These are the garments Esau took from Nimrod. They are the precious garments from Adam, which came to the hands of Nimrod, who used them when he hunted, as it is written, \"He was a mighty hunter before Hashem\" (Beresheet 10:9). And Esau went into the field, where he fought with and killed Nimrod, removing the garments from him. This is the meaning of \"and Esau came from the field, and he was faint\" (Beresheet 25:29). It has already been explained why it is here written, \"And he was faint,\" and elsewhere, \"for my soul faints before the slayers\" (Yirmeyah 4:31). These are analogous. There it is written \"faint\" to refer to killing. Here too, there is killing, because Esau murdered Nimrod.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Do any classic commentators explain Azazel as Eza-zal, meaning Goat-begone, i.e. ward off the influence of Esau-Seir(Goat)-Accuser which seems to be the pshat here? --</p>\n<p>145a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For when Yisrael offered a goat, the serpent was subdued and became a slave as we learned. Therefore, Jacob served his father two goats (Heb. se'irim), one with which to subjugate Esau, who is hairy (Heb. sa'ir), and the other for the grade upon which Esau depended and to which he cleaved. (i.e., Samael).\nTherefore the world is accursed until a woman comes, who resembles Eve, and a man, who resembles Adam. They will deceive and beguile [146a] the serpent and the one ruling him, (meaning Samael). We have already learned this.\nHe opened the discussion with the verse, \"and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents\" (Beresheet 25:27). The phrase \"a plain man\" means a whole man, according to the Aramaic translation, (for he was) \"dwelling in tents.\" He was plain because he dwelt in tents, he held fast the two sides, Abraham and Isaac. Because Jacob came to Esau from the side of Isaac. As we learned from the verse, \"With the merciful you will show yourself merciful...and with the perverse you will show yourself subtle\" (Tehilim 18:26-27). When he came to receive the blessings, he came with support of Abraham and Isaac from above, and so all was done wisely.\nCome and behold, When Jacob arose against Samael, the grade of Esau, Samael fought and wrestled with him, but Jacob overpowered him in several ways. He conquered the serpent with cunning and subtlety, but he was only overpowered by the goat (the two goats he served to his father Isaac). And though all is one, (meaning the serpent and Samael) nevertheless he also conquered and overpowered Samael in another battle. This is derived from the verse, \"and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he did not prevail against him\" (Beresheet 32:25-26).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Meanwhile I've found most of these answers below in Yoma 67b.

Therefore, the verse states: “In the wilderness.”\nAnd from where does one derive that the goat is pushed from a cliff? The verse states “gezeira,” indicating an area that is sharp, like a cliff.\nIt was taught in another baraita: Azazel is a reference to the hardest mountain, and so it says: “And the mighty [eilei] of the land he took away” (Ezekiel 17:13).\n[Azazel is interpreted as azaz-el, with the term el connoting something rough and hard.]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנָא דְּבֵי רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל עֲזָאזֵל שֶׁמְּכַפֵּר עַל מַעֲשֵׂה עוּזָּא וְעַזָּאֵל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Azazel is so called because it atones for the actions of Uzza and Azael.\n[These are the names of “sons of God,” accusing angels who having been cast down by God usurped their power to sexually exploit lowly “daughters of men” (Genesis 6:2) and thereby caused the world to sin during the generation of the Flood.]</p>\n\n\n",

The attribute of mercy stood before Moshe Rabbienu and told him: “I will tell you of good tidings and you shall be happy because of them, turn your face towards the Throne of Mercy and see” and he turned his face towards the Throne of Mercy and saw the Holy One Blessed Is He building the Temple out of pretty stones and jewels, and between every stone the splendor of the Shechinah, which is greater than the jewels, and Mashiach ben David standing in it, and Aharon his brother standing on his feet and his tunic upon him.</p>\n<p>Aharon spoke with Moshe: “The time has come. Do not touch me, because I fear for you from the Shechinah, because no man can enter here without tasting death and having given his soul to the angel of death.” Upon hearing the words of Aharon, he fell on his face before the Holy One Blessed Is He and said to Him: “Master of the Universe, give me permission to speak with your Mashiach before I die.” Said the Holy One Blessed Is He to him<sup>1</sup>: “Go and teach him my Great Name, so that the heat of the Shechinah will not burn him.”</p>\n<p>When Mashiach ben David and Aharon his brother saw him, they understood that Hashem had taught him His great Name, and Mashiach and Aharon stood before him and said to him: “May he who enters be blessed in the name of the LORD.” Moshe asked Mashiach ben David, and he told him: “The Holy One Blessed Is He will build the Temple in the Land of Yisrael, and I will also see Him build the Temple in His hand in heaven.” Said Mashiach to Moshe: “Moshe! Yaakov your forefather saw the House that He will build on earth and saw the House that with His hand in heaven, and understood will every fiber of his being, that the House that the Holy One Blessed Is He will build with His hand in heaven and with pretty stones and jewels and with the splendor of the Shechinah is the House that will stand for Yisrael for eternity until the end of all of the generations. And so he spoke during the night that he sat upon the rock, and saw Yerushalayim build on earth and saw Yerushalayim built in heaven, and he saw [he(?)] stood(?) For Yaakov our Forefather, and the Holy One Blessed Is He spoke to Yaakov: “Yaakov my son! In this time I stand over you, until your sons shall stand before Me, as it says: “And the LORD was standing beside him”, and about Yisrael it says: “and they took their places at the foot of the mountain”, “you stand today”, and when Yaakov saw one Yerushalayim on earth and one Yerushalayim in heaven and said “This that is upon earth is but nothing”, as it says: “This is none other than the House”, this is not the House that will stand for my descendants for generations upon generations, but rather that House of God that He builds with His hands, and if you say that the Holy One Blessed Is He build for Himself the Temple in heaven with His hands, so He will build the one on earth with His hands, as it says: “The sanctuary, O LORD, which Your hands established”.”</p>\n<p>When Moshe Rabbienu heard these things from the strength(?) of Mashiach ben David he became incredibly happy and he turned his face towards the Holy One Blessed Is He and said to him: “Master of the Universe, when will this Yerushalayim, that is build, descend down?” Said to him the Holy One Blessed Is He: “The time – I haven’t told it to any created being – not to the first ones nor to the last ones, and to you I shall tell?!” He said to him: “Master of the Universe, give me a hint from the events.” Said to him the Holy One Blessed Is He: “I shall disperse Yisrael first with a thresher(?) At the gates of the land and they shall disperse to the four corners of the world among all of the nations and shall come to pass upon them the words “Even if your outcasts etc”, and I shall apply My hand a second time and bring those that went with Yonah son of Amitai to the Land of the Patrosites and those that were in the Land of Shinar and in Chamat and in Elam and in Cush etc as it says “my Lord will apply His hand again etc”. At that time, Moshe descended from heaven, happy, and the angel of death descended after him and he did not give his spirit and soul to the angel until Hashem showed him His face and he gave his soul to the Holy One Blessed Is He wholeheartedly and willfully for “this is none other than the house etc”.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here's the second version:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is written: “Many women have done well, But you surpass them all” (Mishlei 31:21) about whom did Shlomo say this passage? He did not say this but alone about Moshe Rabbeinu, that the Holy One Blessed Is He weighed all of the righteous people against him and Moshe outweighed all of them. What did the Holy One Blessed Is He out of His great love for Moshe? He brought all of the creations of Genesis and put them on what scale and Moshe on the other scale, and Moshe outweighed all of them.</p>\n<p>To what were Adam and Moshe similar? To two great doctors, one who was bitten by a snake and didn’t know how to heal himself and died, and one who healed everyone who had been bitten by a snake, who is greater? Not the one who healed everyone? Such was Adam, as it is said about him: “The serpent duped me [and] I ate”, and he died because of the snake, but Moshe made a copper snake, and everyone who was bitten by a snake would look at it and would be healed, as it is said: “And if anyone who is bitten etc(?) looks at it, he shall recover”, therefore Moshe was greater than Adam.</p>\n<p>To what were Noach and Moshe similar? To two men who brought gifts to a king. The first one entered, and the king took from his hand and sniffed it, and it was not acceptable to him. Entered the second and when the king took from his hand, he told him: “Know that I shall eat by you twice every day, in the evening and in the morning.” Such was Noach, when he would make a sacrifice before the Holy One Blessed Is He, it is written: “The LORD smelled the pleasing odor etc”. But Moshe, when he made a sacrifice, the Holy One Blessed Is He said: “Know that I shall eat by you twice every day”, as it is said: “You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other lamb at twilight”, therefore Moshe was greater than Noach.</p>\n<p>To what were Avraham and Moshe similar? To a matron who had two sons: One took tools and mortgaged them to another, and one went and paid off the mortgage. Which of these is more beloved? Not the one that freed them? Such was Avraham, for one single thing he mortgaged off Yisrael and caused them to dwell in Egypt, as it is said: “And He said to Abraham: “Know etc” but Moshe went and freed them, as it is said: “He sent His servant Moses, and Aaron, whom He had chosen”.</p>\n<p>To what were Yitzchak and Moshe similar? To a candle and a lamp, the candle burned out from the evening and the lamp remained lit until the morning. Which is greater? Not the lamp? Such was Yitzchak that because he looked at the Shechinah, his eyes were blinded, but Moshe ascended to heaven and looked upon the figure of the Holy One Blessed Is He, as it is said: “The LORD would speak to Moses face to face”, and what is written “Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated”, therefore Moshe was greater than Yitzchak.</p>\n<p>To what were Yaakov and Moshe similar? To two men who descended into cages(?). One grabbed a lion and fought it and defeated it, and the lion injured him, and the other descended into a cage that was full of lion. When they saw him, they went and decorated him with wreaths and fell at his feet. Which is greater? Not the one that they fell at his feet? Such was Yaakov, an angel descended and did battle with him, and though he defeated him, the angel injured him, as it is said: “The sun rose upon him…limping on his hip”, but Moshe rose to heaven and the angels saw and fled from his face, as it is said: “You went up to the heights, having taken captives”, therefore Moshe was greater than Yaakov.</p>\n<p>To what were Yosef and Moshe similar? To an abstainer and a drunkard. The abstainer had a barrel of wine in his house for safekeeping, and the drunkard had a barrel of wine in his house. Came Yom Kippur and both fasted from the wine. Which of them is greater? Not the drunkard? Such was Yosef, who would abstain from the wife of his master, as it is said: “How then could I do this most wicked thing etc”, but Moshe had his wife with him and he did not lie with her, therefore Moshe was greater than Yosef.</p>\n<p>And not only that, but the Holy One Blessed Is He weighed him with all of the creations of Genesis that He made in the first six days of Genesis and Moshe outweighed [them], how was this so? In the first day the Holy One Blessed Is He created light, as it is said: “God called the light Day” and about Moshe it is written: “And He called to Moshe”, so the Torah was compared to light, as it is said “For the commandment is a lamp, The teaching is a light”, Moshe rose to heaven and took it captive, as it is said: “You went up to the heights, having taken captives”, which is greater, that which was taken captive or its captor? Therefore, Moshe was greater than the light.</p>\n<p>On the second day, the Holy One Blessed Is He created the expanse, and wrote about it: “God called the expanse Sky”, and about Moshe it is written: “And He called to Moshe”. Therefore, both are equal, which is comparable to two people, one had permission to walk in the his friend’s garden and the other did not have permission, so the expanse did not have permission to walk on earth, but Moshe rose to the expanse, therefore Moshe was greater than the expanse.</p>\n<p>On the third day, the Holy One Blessed Is He created the water, as it is said: “and the gathering of waters He called Seas”, and about Moshe it is written: “And He called to Moshe”. Therefore, both are equal, which is comparable to two lords who were walking along one path, one hid his legions from his friend and the other passed by. Such was Moshe, when the sea saw him it fled, as it is said: “The Sea saw and fled”, therefore Moshe was greater than the sea.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day, the Holy One Blessed Is He created the lights, as it is said: “And God created the two lights etc” and wrote of them that “to all He gave names”, and about Moshe it is written: “And He called to Moshe”. Therefore, both are equal. This is comparable to a king who wed off his daughter. Came the servant to light up the face of the bride, and the groom did not let him, so Moshe told the Holy One Blessed Is He: “It is not my will that the sun and moon shall shine, but that You shall”, as it is said: “The LORD went before them by day”, therefore Moshe was greater than the lights.</p>\n<p>On the fifth day, the Holy One Blessed Is He created the animals and birds, and Moshe brought them and slaughtered them for Yisrael, as it is said: “the flocks and herds he slaughtered for them”. Who is greater, the butcher or the slaughtered?</p>\n<p>Moshe began blessing every tribe by itself, but when he saw that time was short, he included all of them together in one blessing and said to them: “Yisrael, I walked with you for a great distance upon the Torah and the commandments, now forgive me.” They said to him: “Our master, Moshe Rabbeinu, forgive us. We have greatly angered you and brought great hardship and labor upon you, forgive us.” He said to them: “You are forgiven.” A heavenly voice rang out and said: “You have no life in this world but half an hour.” He said to them: “Please, I beg of you, when you enter the land remember me and my bones.” And they said: “Woe to the son of Amram who run before us like a horse and his bones fell in the wilderness!” At that time Yisrael cried bitterly, and they said to him: “Moshe Rabbeinu, if you leave us, what will become of us?” He replied: “My children, for all of those past days, the Holy One Blessed Is He was with you, and even now He was with you. Perhaps you shall say: “All those great miracles that were done for you, were done by me for me, they were not done but for the Holy One Blessed Is He’s mercy, as it says: “The LORD Is good to all etc”, all that He has done was done for His honor, if you will trust in Him fully, He shall do all you wish.” At that time Yisrael opened their mouths and said: “God is our refuge and stronghold etc”. Until now, a quarter of an hour had passed for him. A heavenly voice rang out and said to him: “Moshe, why do you cause yourself grief, you have but a quarter of an hour in this world!” Immediately Moshe stood and blessed all of Yisrael, and set before them the blessings by themselves and the curses by themselves, [and] once Moshe saw through Ruach Hakodesh the value of the world being a good reward and the great miracles that the Holy One Blessed Is He was to do for them in the future, he said to them: “O happy Israel! Who is like you” and he said goodbye and stood on his feet, and his voice cried out, and he cried bitterly, and he said to Yisrael: “In peace [b’shalom, a greeting tied to death, as opposed with l’shalom, to peace], I shall see in the resurrection of the dead, I shall see you in the coming future.” And he left with a great cry, and they too cried out bitterly and lamented greatly and bitterly until their cries rose and ascended to the heavens.</p>\n<p>What did Moshe do? He tore his robe and pulled out his beard and rolled his head in the dirt, and he took his tunic and covered his head like a mourner and he entered his tent in a great and bitter lament, and he cried and clapped his hands [in bitterness] and said: “Woe is me, that such a cry has befallen me, woe are my feet that did not step in the Land of Yisrael, woe are my hands that did not pick of its fruit, woe is my throat that did not eat from the fruits of the Land of Milk and Honey.”</p>\n<p>And no man should think that Moshe was [merely] saddened from not eating fruits, because all of it hinted to keeping the commandments that were kept there more than in other lands, for it was more beloved than all of the other lands,  as it says: “which the LORD your God forever looks after etc”, and it was created first as it says: “He had not yet made earth and fields” – these are the wildernesses, “Or the world’s first clumps of clay” – this is the Land of Yisrael which is called the Land of the Holy One Blessed Is He, as it says: “Rejoicing in His inhabited world”, and why was it called Tevel [world]? For it is flavored with everything [me’tubal], that each country has something that the other does not, but the Land of Yisrael is not lacking in anything, as it says: “where you will lack nothing”. Another option for why it was called Tevel, after the seasoning that is in it, which is the Torah, as it says: “more desirable than gold, than much fine gold”, and so said our sages in Genesis Rabbah: “The name of the first is Pishon, the one that winds through the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is”, said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: “Chavilah – that’s the Land of Yisrael. And why was it called Chavilah? Because it has longs for the Holy One Blessed Is He, as it says: “Have longing for God; I will yet praise Him”. “Where the gold is” – that’s the Torah, as it says: “The gold of that land is good”, Rabbi Yochanan said: “From here we see that there is no Torah like the Torah of the Land of Yisrael, and there is no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Yisrael. “Crystal is there, and lapis lazuli” – you think this is referring to the crystal of apothecaries? Let another verse clarify it for you, and the lapis lazuli, just as lapis lazuli is a pretty stone, as it is written: “stones of lapis lazuli”, so too crystal is a pretty stone. “Crystal is there” – the study of Torah, aggadot, calculations of seasons and gematriyot, for this Moshe Rabbienu wanted to see it, and he would say: “Let me, I pray, cross over and see the good land” – that’s the Land of Yisrael, “that good hill country, and the Lebanon.” – that’s the Temple which was called Lebanon because it whitened [helbin] the sins of Yisrael, as it says: “be your sins like crimson etc”. And our sages also said (Sotah 14): “For what reason did Moshe so dearly want to enter the Land, did he need to eat from its fruits or be full from its goods? No, so Moshe would say: “There are many commandments we were commanded that can only be kept in the Land, I shall enter the Land so that I may be able to keep all of them myself.”</p>\n<p>The Holy One Blessed Is He said: “Moshe, do you simply wish to earn the reward for [keeping] them? I shall make it as though you kept all of them! One might have thought that he will receive reward like the later ones and not like the earlier ones, so the verse states: “And he shall divide the spoil with the mighty,” meaning like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were mighty in Torah and in mitzvot. “Because he bared his soul unto death,” meaning he gave himself over to death on behalf of the Jewish people, as it is stated: “Yet now, if You will forgive their sin; and if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your book that You have written”. “And was numbered with the transgressors,” meaning that he was counted among those who died in the desert, for, just like them, he did not enter Eretz Yisrael. “Yet he bore the sin of many,” as he atoned for the incident of the Golden Calf. “And made intercession [yafgia] for the transgressors,” as he requested mercy for the sinners of Israel so that they should engage in repentance. And the word pegia means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession [tifga] to Me; for I will not hear you”.”\nUntil now, this costed him a moment and a half, what did Moshe do? He picked up the scroll and wrote upon it the True Name and handed it to Yehoshua, and did not fill the writing until the hour of his death came. At that hour the Holy One Blessed Is He said to Gavriel: “Bring Me the soul of Moshe.” Answered Gavriel before Him: “Master of the Universe, he who is comparable to 600,000, how can I act rudely before him?” Immediately He said to Michael: “Go and bring Me the soul of Moshe.” Immediately Michael cried. He said to Ganael: “Bring Me the soul of Moshe.” He said before Him: “Master of the Universe, I was his master and he was my student, I cannot take his soul.”</p>\n<p>Came Samael and stood before the Holy One Blessed Is He and said: “Master of the Universe, is Moshe, the master of Yisrael greater than Adam, who you created in your world, in your image and form, is he greater than Avraham your beloved who was thrown into the oven to sanctify your Name, is he greater than Yitzchak who was bound up on the altar and from Yaakov your firstborn son and from his twelve sons, your saplings, and none escaped my hands, give me permission and I shall take his soul.” Said the Holy One Blessed Is He: “All of them were not in the image of this one.” He said to him: “Out of where can you take his soul? If from his face, the face that was against My face, as it is said: “The LORD would speak to Moses face to face”, how would you be able to go near it? If you say “from his hands”, the hands that received the tablets, how can you go near them? If you say “from his legs”, they already came up to my mist, how would you be able to go near them? You have no permission for any of his limbs!” He said: “Master of the Universe, even so, give me permission to take his soul.” He said to him: “You have permission.” Immediately Samael left in great cheer from before the Holy One Blessed Is He, and buckled his sword and dressed in cruelty and wrapped himself in his anger and walked up to Moshe in his fury, but once he saw that he was writing the True Name and sparks of fire came out of his mouth and the light of his words shining like the sun and he resembled an angel of the Lord of Hosts, Samael trembled, and said in his heart: “It seems the angels spoke true when they said they couldn’t take his soul”, immediately Samael’s eyes were blinded from the radiance of Moshe’s eyes, and when Samael saw the radiance of Moshe’s eyes he fell on his face in awe and fear and he was overcome with a trembling like a woman in the throes of labor and he found that he could not say anything to his face until Moshe Rabbeinu said to him: “Samael, Samael, There is no safety—said the LORD—for the wicked, what are you doing, why are you standing before me?” He said to him: “Your time to leave this world has come; give me your soul.” He said to him: “Who sent you to me?” He said to him: “He Who created the world and the souls.” He said to him: “I will not give you my soul.” He said to him: “But, after all, the souls of all mortals are within my reach!” He said to him: “In me I have strength greater than that of all of the mortals!”</p>\n<p>He said to him: “What is your strength?” He said to him: “I am the son of Amram who left the intestine of my mother circumcised (and so our sages said in Sotah and when she saw him that he was a goodly [tov] child…They said he was good because he was born when he was already circumcised. And the Rabbis say: At the time when Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light, as it is written here: “And when she saw him that he was a goodly [tov] child,” and it is written there: “And God saw the light, that it was good [tov]”) and in that same day I spoke with my father and mother, and when I was three months old I prophesied and I said: “I am destined to receive the Torah from the fiery flames (and this is what our sages hinted at when they said And she opened it and saw it [vatirehu], even the child” (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara comments: The verse states: “And she saw it”; it should have stated: And she saw. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: In addition to Moses, she saw the Divine Presence with him. And this was at the end of three months, as is also written: “and she hid him for three moons”) and when I was eighty years old I made miracles and fantastic feats in Egypt and I took out from there 600,000, and I split the sea into twelves strips and I sweetened the water of Marah [bitter] and I crafted the two stone tablets and I rose to heaven and I saw the Shechinah and I spoke with it face to face and I received the Torah out of the fiery flames from the left and right of the Holy One Blessed Is He, and I wrote according to His mouth the 613 commandments, and I taught them to Yisrael, who is there in the whole world who could do as I did, wicked entity, go because I shall not give you my soul!” This cost Moshe a moment, [and] a heavenly voice rang out and said to him: “Moshe, why do you cause yourself grief, for you have only a moment of life left.”\nImmediately Samael returned to speak before the Almighty, in that moment the LORD became angry at him and said to him: “Go and bring me the soul of Moshe!” Replied Samael and said: “Master of the Universe, if you say to me “go to gehinnom and turn the bottom right-side-up”, I shall do it in a moment and will not delay to do as You command, but before the son of Amram I cannot stand!” Said to him the Holy One Blessed Is He: “Why not?” He said to Him: “Because he resembles a seraph of Your chariot and sparks came out of his mouth when he spoke to me and the radiance of his face resembled the radiance of the Shechinah; please, don’t send me to him, for I cannot stand before him.” At this, the Holy One Blessed Is He became angry with him and said to him: “From the fires of gehinnom you were created and to fire you are destined to return, at first you exited from before me with great cheer and when you saw his greatness and might, you tell me that you are unable to stand before him, it is clear to Me that you are destined to return before him with a great request.”</p>\n<p>Immediately Samael went and stood before Moshe and said to him: “Moshe, such is what the Holy One Blessed Is He told me: “Go and bring to Me the soul of Moshe”.” What did Samael do? He drew his sword from its sheath and stood above Moshe, immediately he stood in great awe and became angry with him, and he picked up the staff of God, upon which was carved the True Name and hit Samael and admonished him with all of his might, a great admonishment, until he fled from before his face. Until now, this cost him half a moment. A heavenly voice rang out and said: “Moshe, why do you cause yourself grief, for the time of your death has arrived.”\nImmediately Moshe stood in prayer before the Holy One Blessed Is He and before Him: “Master of the Universe, remember the day You appeared upon me in the bush, remember the day that I ascended before You atop Mount Sinai and I received Your Torah and gave it Your people Yisrael, please, I beg of You, merciful God, do not hand me over to the angel of death. At that moment a heavenly voice rang out and said to him: “I have already received your prayer, and I myself shall take care of your burial.” Immediately Moshe stood and sanctified himself like the seraphim of glory, and the Holy One Blessed Is He descended from the upper heavens to receive the soul of Moshe. When he saw the Holy One Blessed Is He, he fell upon his face and said: “Master of the Universe, with Your attribute of mercy You created Your world, and with Your attribute of mercy You manage it, please manage me with Your attribute of mercy. A heavenly voice rang out and said: “Moshe, do not fear, because your righteousness shall march before you, the honor of the LORD will collect you.”</p>\n<p>Three angels descended at that time with the Holy One Blessed Is He, Michael, Gavriel and Ganael [in other versions: Zagziel or Zagzagel or Zaganzagiel]. Gavriel prepared Moshe’s bed, Michael spread a sheet of purple and Ganael place a pillow of fine wool beneath his head. The Holy One Blessed Is He stood above his head and Ganael at his feet, and Gavriel from one side and Michael on the other side. Said the Holy One Blessed Is He to him: “Connect your two legs together.” And he did so. And again, He said to him: “Place your two hands on your chest.” And he did. And again, He said to him: “Lower your eyelids over your eyes.” And he did.</p>\n<p>At that moment, the Holy One Blessed Is He called to Moshe’s soul and said to it: “My daughter, one hundred and twenty years I have set aside for you in the body of Moshe, come out and do not be tardy, for your end has come.” She immediately replied to the Holy One Blessed Is He: “I know that You are the God of Spirits and Souls, and in Your hands are the spirits of the living and the dead, and You created me and You molded me and You put me into Moshe’s body for one hundred and twenty years, and who is there that has a body as pure as Moshe’s, I do not want to leave it!” Again, He said to her: “Do not be tardy, for your end has come, and I shall now raise you up to the upper heavens and seat you with honor beneath the Throne of Honor.” When Moshe saw that his soul was finding it difficult to leave, he said to her: “Say that the angel of death will be in control.” She said to him: “The Holy One Blessed Is He won’t do so, because you saved my spirit from death.” – “Say “I am about to be sent to gehinnom”.” She said to him: “my feet from stumbling” – he said to her: “And where are you destined to go to?” She said to him: “I shall walk before the LORD in the lands of the living”. Upon hearing this from her, he gave her permission and said to her: “Be at rest, once again, O my soul etc”. Once the Holy One Blessed Is He saw this, He kissed him and withdrew his soul with the kiss of the mouth as it is said: “So Moses the servant of the LORD died there, in the land of Moab, at the command of the LORD”.</p>\n<p>At that hour the Holy One Blessed Is He cried and said: “”Who will take my part against evil men etc”? When there will be sinners, who will asked for mercy for them?” And the serving angels cried and said: “And the wisdom, from where will it be found?” And the skies cried and said: “A pious man has been lost from the earth”, and the earth cried and said: “And the most just of man is not”, and all the creations of Genesis cried and said: “The righteous man has been lost and no one has taken notice”, and Yehoshua hugged Moshe and screamed and cried: “Save us LORD, because a pious man has been finished.” And all of Yisrael cried and said: “He executed the LORD’s judgments”, and the Holy One Blessed Is He praised him and said: “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses”, And the Holy One Blessed Is He said to him: “You said about Me “there is no other”, as it is written: “It has been clearly demonstrated to you that the LORD alone is God; there is none beside Him”, so too I wrote in My Torah: “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses” (the death of Moshe is an atoning altar for all of Yisrael, as our sages said Rabbi Yitzchak said etc).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> \"...to Matat\" (Metatron) in Eisenstein's version (i.e., Hashem told Metatron to teach Moshe His Name, and then Moshe goes to Aharon and Mashiach).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>What he is telling you is that there is a widespread medrash concerning the death of Moshe (i.e. occurs across multiple medrashim) in which Moshe complains that he should not have to die, wrestles with the <em>malach ha'maves</em> and in the end persuades his soul to surrender to its fate.</p>\n<p>Since this medrash is so widespread it appears (and appears in the <em>medrash rabbah</em>) it appears to be reputable and also from a very early source.</p>\n<p>The medrash is poetic and raises some interesting theological questions.</p>\n\n\n",

Any modern printed Torah and/or Tanach ultimately comes from those. The most famous of them, of course, is the one that was kept in Syria for many centuries, and is known as the \"<a href=\"https://barhama.com/ajaxzoom/viewer/viewer.php?zoomDir=/pic/AleppoWM/&example=viewer5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleppo Codex</a>.\"</p>\n<p>The scholars who handwrote the vowel-and-punctuation versions left notes in their margins. Some point out relatively simple things, such as \"this word is the midpoint of the Torah as counted by words\"; occasionally there's a note that while one word is written in the Torah, a different word should be pronounced (e.g. you will hear <em>and another man will sleep with your fiancee</em>, when a much stronger word is actually written in the place of \"sleep with\"); and many were intended as a form of error checking their work, e.g. \"note that this word is written with a funny spelling, and it occurs this way twice elsewhere in the Tanach in the following places.\"</p>\n<p>So today's Torah scrolls don't have any of these marks; you'll see all of them in an original codex; and some of them will appear in a modern printed Tanach, depending on the edition (where computers mean the error-checking notes aren't as necessary).</p>\n<p>Here's an example, from the Aleppo Codex near the end of the Book of Ruth:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rX8z4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rX8z4.png\" alt=\"Image of Aleppo Codex from end of Ruth\" /></a></p>\n<p>The blue box is the Biblical text, with the vowels and cantillation marks. The \"masoretic\" notes are above, in the red box. The first references the verse here reads <em>and may his name be called</em>, \"ve-yee-ka-rei.\" The note tells me that the word as vowelized, \"and may it be called\", occurs only once else, near the end of Genesis. (This is an error check as most other times a word with those letters appear, it is vowelized <em>vayikra</em> -- \"and he called.\")</p>\n\n\n",

I've participated in a couple of such events and I was never told about any general or event-specific Halachic precautions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bDHHZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bDHHZ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://avax.news/wow/Reality_of_a_Grand_Hasidic_Wedding.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">avax.news</a></em></p>\n<p>I know that there are numerous government rules and standards (for example <a href=\"http://www.osh.org.il/site/news/news011707.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Israeli standard ת\"י 5688 - בטיחות באירועים המוניים</a>) sanctioning such events and defining guidelines for emergency services, evacuation, etc.</p>\n<p>Did Rabbinic authorities ever issue Psakim or Takkanot regarding observing Venishmartem in such potentially life-threatening events?

Let's call it <em>na-GUHCH</em>.</p>\n<p>The much more common conjugation, \"nuh-GACH\" is to reverse those vowels and omit the dot inside the 2nd letter, which gives you the simple, third-person past tense, which is the simplest form of most vowel roots in Hebrew. (\"Gored.\")</p>\n<p>The form used here, however, refers to a profession. \"Melach\" is salt, and a <em>ma-LUHCH</em> is a sailor. <em>Ta-BUHCH</em> is a butcher (\"tuh-VACH\" means \"butchered\"); <em>chayil</em> is an army, and <em>cha-YUHL</em> is a soldier. (You've certainly heard it in Modern Hebrew, but it's also in Ecclesiastes; Numbers uses \"the army men\" [anshei hatzava], a term the Chafetz Chaim used in his work for Jews drafted in the Czar's army ... but <em>chayuhl</em> is shorter.)</p>\n<p>(There's a famous comment in Rashi about a king chatting up the \"camel drivers and donkey drivers\" -- use this same vowel construction and you realize it's the profession; not \"I chatted up the camels and donkeys.\")</p>\n<p>As I'm not aware of a full-time profession goring per se (okay, maybe bulls used in bullfighting), the Torah is cleverly using this construction here for \"a habitual gorer.\"</p>\n<p>Per request of other such nouns-derived-from-verbs in Tanach: I attempted to script it. Easy way to weed out the false positives was just look for this pattern in the masculine plural. Here's a few, in descending order of biblical frequency:</p>\n<p>טַבָּחִים (butchers/executioners)</p>\n<p>גַּנָּבִים (thieves)</p>\n<p>כַּוָּנִים</p>\n<p>לַעַזָּתִים (?)</p>\n<p>הַקַּלָּעִים (sling-shooters)</p>\n<p>וְהָחַמָּנִים (sun-gods)</p>\n<p>הַדַּיָּגִים (fishermen)</p>\n<p>צַיָּדִים (hunters/trappers)</p>\n<p>הַגַּלָּבִים</p>\n<p>וּבַטָּחִים</p>\n<p>וְגַמָּדִים</p>\n<p>דַּוָּגִים</p>\n<p>הָרַמָּכִים (breeding stock, most likely)</p>\n<p>הָרַקָּחִים (perfumers)</p>\n<p>For those playing along at home, if you don't want to put Hebrew into your code, turn everything into hex vals.</p>\n<pre><code>    # patach something dagesh kamatz something chirik yud mem-sofit \n\nre.match('.*0x5b7 0x.{3} 0x5bc 0x5b8 0x.{3} 0x5b4 0x5d9 0x5dd.*', hex_vals)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Woops, this doesn't get you the soldiers in Koheles 10:10. וַחֲיָלִים, יְגַבֵּר Exercise for the reader!</p>\n\n\n",

Of course, it is possible the thief might have other financial resources coming from honest activities which could provide a leniency with regard to institutions who received donations from him.</p>\n<p>Since we see above that, in many cases, the money can be accepted, the fourth question becomes less relevant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Egypt a case was discussed about donations from unsavory sources.

Raphael Aaron ben Shimon, Nehar Mitzrayim (Alexandria, 1908), vol. 1, p. 12a, discusses a case where not only did the prostitute donate a parochet, but she also inscribed her name into it in golden letters. As R. Raphael notes, this is especially problematic since if allowed then people praying in synagogue would see her name staring down upon them and this would invariably lead to improper thoughts. (He adds that this particular prostitute had been with a lot of the young Jewish men.) Therefore, he ruled that the parochet could not be used and any gifts from prostitutes to the synagogue could not have their names on it. He also mentions a prostitute who donated a sefer Torah to the synagogue (!), and this was accepted on the condition that her name not appear on it..\"</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://seforimblog.com/2014/08/the-pew-report-and-orthodox-community/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://seforimblog.com/2014/08/the-pew-report-and-orthodox-community/</a></p>\n\n\n",

Therefore I say my proof is a complete proof, because only this way is it a complete explanation of \"will be called to you seed\" to exclude Yishmael.  Indeed it's a complete explanation.  \"In Yitzchak\" [meaning] not all of Yitzchak, to exclude Esau, because otherwise it would have said \"Ki Yitzchak yikare lekha zera/ Only Yitzchak is your seed.\"  But instead it says \"Only <strong>in</strong> Yitzchak\" which seems a bit similar to \"Lekha\" – \"yikare <strong>le</strong>kha zera/ <strong>to</strong> you will be called seed\" so not all of you, namely Esau the wicked.  And since he's not called seed to Abraham, Yitzchak also is not called seed.  And those sworn off from the seed of Yitzchak will be permitted to seed of Esau.\nAnd do not say it's only regarding Abraham that Esau is not called his seed, since he's wicked and is not really his son; but in relation to Yitzchak he's is actual son; even though he's wicked he's called his son.For behold Yishmael who is really son of Abraham is not called his seed due to being unlike him, as it's explained, from the scripture \"Yikare lekha zera/ will be called <strong>to</strong> you [i.e. resembling your character] seed\" and not Yishmael, and all the more so Esau who did not cherish the seed of Yitzchak even though he was his actual son.  And he's more wicked than Yishmael.  Yishmael did teshuvah, and the fact that it's not taught that those sworn off from the seed of Yitzchak are permitted to Esau, is because there is reason it ought to be necessary to teach that those sworn off from the seed of Abraham are permitted to Yishmael, but after it's been taught [in Mishnah] that those sworn off from the seed of Abraham are permitted to Yishmael and Esau, all the more so those sworn off from the seed of Yitzchak are permitted to Esau, as it says.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולענין‬\n‫מה‬ ‫שהקשית‬ ‫על‬ ‫הראיה‬ ‫שהביא‬ ‫הריב\"ש‬ ז\"ל‬ ‫על‬ ‫נוסחת ‫ועקדת‬ ‫יצחק‬

They believe at the same time that the human soul does not die when the body dies, but that there is a stage of existence called Gan Eden (Paradise) where, immediately after death, the souls of the righteous are kept until they rise in resurrection and obtain the life in the world to come after the resurrection. <strong>This is what the Rabbis mean when they relate concerning Rabban Simon ben Gamaliel that he said to Rabbi Ishmael, who was weeping when he was condemned to die: Master, why weepest thou? In a brief moment thou wilt be placed in Gan Eden in the community of the righteous. We are also told that Rabbah bar Rab Huna said concerning Rabbah bar Shela, who died a short time before him: He preceded me in Gan Eden by a brief hour. This is the opinion of Nahmanides, of R.

Here is the paragraph reproduced with the footnotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is what the Rabbis mean when they relate concerning Rabban Simon ben Gamaliel that he said to Rabbi Ishmael, who was weeping when he was condemned to die: Master, why weepest thou? In a brief moment thou wilt be placed in Gan Eden in the community of the righteous.<sup>1</sup> We are also told<sup>2</sup> that Rabbah bar Rab Huna said concerning Rabbah bar Shela, who died a short time before him: He preceded me in Gan Eden by a brief hour.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

Also, the translation skips the Hebrew phrases wherein the author provides his own citations. These phrases are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזהו שאמרו רבותינו ז\"ל במסכת שמחות</p>\n<p>And this is what the Rabbis said in Tractate Semahot</p>\n<p>(My translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמרו גם כן במסכת נדה</p>\n<p>And they said as well in Tractate Niddah</p>\n<p>(My translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In regard to Rabban Shimon Gamliel and Rabbi Yishmael it is coming from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Semachot.8.8?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Semachot 8:8</a> as listed on Sefaria, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חוכשבאו רשב\"ג ורבי ישמעאל גזרו עליהם שיהרגו והיה רבי ישמעאל בוכה ור\"ש אמר אברך בשתי פסיעות אתה נתן בחיקם של צדיקים ואתה בוכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven't seen a proof of this concerning Rabbah bar Shela but based upon the expression that Rabbah bar Bar Huna is quoted as saying, לשעה קלה הקדימני לגן עדן, this appears to referencing <em>the nephew</em> of Rabbi Yossi ben Yoezer of Tzareida who is given the nickname <em>Ish Tzarurot</em>. Rabbi Yossi lived at a time of severe persecution by the Greeks and may himself have been executed <em>Al Kiddush HaShem</em>.</p>\n<p>The details of this reference can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.65?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 65:22</a> and also in the much later text, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avot.4.17.1?vhe=Magen_Avot,_Leipzig_1855&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avot at the end of 4:17:1</a>.

May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How come she uses the masculine form of the bolded words instead of the feminine form (עִמָּכֶן and עֲשִׂיתֶ֛ן) when she is speaking to females?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the commentary of the medieval rabbinic grammarian, R. Yosef Caspi, in biblical Hebrew, women are occasionally addressed in either masculine or feminine verb endings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין קושייא מאמרו אלו הכנויים לאלו הנשים פעם בדרך לשון זכר , כמו \"עמכם\" , \"עשיתם\" (לעיל , ח) , \"והֵמה\" (להלן , כב); ופעם לשון נקבה , כמו \"לכנה\" , \"שובנה\" (לעיל , ח) , ומצאן , ורבים זולת זה - כי כבר הודעתיך יסוד זה (מ\"כ ח\"ב ע' 20 - 21 ).</p>\n<p>There is no difficulty in that sometimes women are referred to these in the\nmasculine  form...and sometimes in the feminine form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, R. Shlomo Alkabetz (author of \"Lecha Dodi\"), in his commentary to Ruth (<em>Shoresh Yishai</em>), reads the the masculine form midrashically -- that the words with a final <em>mem</em> instead of a final feminine <em>nun</em> hints that Hashem would reward them for the <em>forty</em> steps the women took in accompanying Naomi thus far toward her journey back (the letter <em>mem</em> has the numerical value of the number forty):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אולם אומרו עמכם במ\"ם וכן כאשר עשיתם במ\"ם ואם הוא סימן זכרות לא נקבות אפשר שכיונה כי עד העת ההיא הלכו עמה מ' פסיעות כדאמרינן במדרש רות רבה ב כ ר' ברכיה בשם ר' יצחק ארבעים פסיעות הלכה ערפה עם חמותה ונתלה לבנה ארבעים יום שנאמר שמואל א' יז טז רגש הפלשתי השכם והערב ויתיצב ארבעים יום ע\"כ ובהיותה כעת בדלי דלות ולא מצאה ידה די השב להן גמולן אמרה כי בעל הגמול יגמול להן שכר הפסיעות ההנה כי ארבעים\nישי הנה ולכן אמר יעש ה' עמכם וכאשר עשיתם כי בפירוש אמרה על התכריכין ועל ויתור הכתובות כמדובר ובסתום הודיעה שאפילו שכר פסיעות תטולנה וכי הנן ספורות והן ארבעים</p>\n<p>It says \"with you\" and \"as you have dealt\" with a <em>mem</em>. If this is a\nmasculine, and not feminine form, it can be explained that they walked\nwith her <em>forty</em> steps\nas it is says in the <em>Midrash Rabba</em> of Ruth in the name of R.\nYitzhak: Orpah walked forty steps with her mother-in-law...therefore,\nHashem will reward you...even these steps taken which amounted to\nforty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, R. Shmuel Yerushami, who is the author of the modern <em>Me'am Lo'ez</em> commentary to Rut, suggests that it's masculine because the women had strong characters, which the Yerushalmi considers \"manly\". I'm not joking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שנכתב בלשון זכר, לרמוז שהיו נשים גברתניות, היינו בעלות רצון חזק.\nועוד שהיא שיבחה את מדותיהן, שזה שנתקרבו לחסות תחת כנפי השכינה לא היה מתוך פניה כל שהיא, אלא היו בעלות מדות טובות גם קודם לכן, והראיה שעשו חסד עם החיים ועם התמים, וזה מעיד על בור לבבם עם ה׳ ואנשים</p>\n<p>It's written in the masculine form to hint at the women's manliness, as they had a strong will. Ruth was thus praising their virtues...that they had good virtues even beforehand, and the evidence that they did acts of loving-kindness with both the living and the dead, testified to the purity of their heart for Hashem and man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Holmstedt's grammatical description of Ruth (<em>Ruth: A Handbook on the Hebrew Text</em>) states for 1:8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The use of morphologically masculine affixes when the referents are clearly feminine, Ruth and Orpah, is not typical although it is attested elsewhere (see <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/135._The_Personal_Pronoun#GHGpar-135-o\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GKC §135o</a>; JM §149–50). In Ruth this happens mostly in the mouth of No‘omi (see also 1:9, 11, 13), although the narrator and the “people of Bethlehem” both use the masculine-for-feminine, twice for the narrator (שתיהם 1.19  and המה 1:22) and once for the Bethlehemites (4:11 שתיהם) in each case the forms refer to two women. Neither Ruth nor Boaz utter the gender switch and even the narrator’s one switch in 1:19 is followed by multiple cases of 3fpl affixes. Moreover, while No‘omi uses a 2mpl <em>qatal</em> verb here in v. 8, she uses 2fpl <em>yiqtol</em> and imperative verbs throughout her speech in this section. It is thus difficult to discern either a grammatical or stylistic reason for the variation. Arguments that the forms reflect dialectal variation or a vestigal feminine dual (Campbell 1975:65) do not explain why the expected -ן suffixes for two females are used elsewhere (1:9, 19 [3x]). It is possible that the narrator uses marginal language to give the book a foreign or perhaps archaic coloring. The number of cases could not have been too many, though, or the language would have interfered with the narrative rather than contributing to it; this might explain the handful of cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It may also be an example of gender neutralization, wherein the less frequent feminine forms are replaced colloquially with the masculine forms.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara is clearly implying a marriage between a female convert and a Jew who is not necessarily a Kohen.</p>\n<p>Are there any other sources in the Gemara which say or suggest that a Jew should not marry a convert?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In context, this was a special directive from Rabbi Yehuda haNasi to his sons. It is unclear whether he actually said this, since his actual words were the cryptic \"Do not sit on the bed of an Aramean woman\", and this is one of several interpretations proffered by the anonymous narrative voice of the Talmud.</p>\n<p>In context, it seems to be a matter of good advice, rather than a prohibition. (Similarly, if it means not to literally sit, based on the incident with Rav Pappa where someone tried to frame him, it is good advice. Perhaps for the meaning of not sleeping without reciting Shema, a new recital of Shema at bedtime, as opposed to e.g. saying a pasuk, is a good idea.) He is not telling them not to eat a ham sandwich, for that is not something that needs to be said to one's children as particular advice.</p>\n<p>As such, we would not necessarily expect that such advice finds basis elsewhere in the Talmud. Rashbam in his commentary on the page, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא תינסוב גיורתא - משום דאמרינן גיורא עד עשרה דרי לא תבזי ארמאה באפיה (סנהדרין צד.):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, he refers us to Sanhedrin 94a, that a convert, even descendants ten generations afterwards, one should not disparage a non-Jew in front of him, because he still identifies in some small measure with than non-Jewish identity. This, firstly, might be the parallel Talmudic statement for which you are searching. But, secondly, this reinforces the idea that this is not a legal statement, but a piece of advice, on the basis of how the person's identity could impact the relationship.</p>\n<p>However, one should note that the royal members of Rabbi Yehuda the Prince's house had their pick of spouses, and could afford to be picky in this aspect. People are complex beings, and one should consider the whole person. While this is one aspect to consider (in terms of the person themselves and the identity of descendants, assuming that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi actually did say it to his children), there are other positive and negative traits that potential spouses have to offer, and one should not blindly refuse to marry a convert, who may be a wonderful person with whom one could built a fine Jewish household, based one line in the Talmud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.24b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 24b</a> states that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>One suspected of relations with a gentile woman and she subsequently converted, may not marry that woman</strong>, since this will strengthen the\nsuspicions against him. But if he did marry her, they, the judges of\nthe court, do not remove her from him, i.e., they do not require him\nto divorce her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara a bit later clarifies this is the opinion of R Nechemia, and Rav disagrees and states \"The halakha is in accordance with the statement of the one who says that they are all converts.\" and therefore it is possible to marry them. And such is the halakha (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.268.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 268:12</a>, MT <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960661/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Thirteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Issurei Biah 13:17</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

It is an active imperative, an instruction to the listener or congregation to sing joyful praise to Hashem.</p>\n<p>Hallelujah appears in 15 different Psalms, between 104-150, and in almost every case at the opening and/or closing of the Tehilm/Psalm.

My question (or chakira) is, is there any difference between the ones that are counted and the ones that aren't? לגבי us, is it all the same and we simply don't know the reasons why some are counted and some are not?</p>\n<p>Or, is it למשל like a tree, with 613 main branches, and the rest are offshoots of those branches, so the ones that are counted get a higher priority.</p>\n<p>If anyone knows any sources on this, or if you have a possible nafka mina in my chakira, please let me know.</p>\n<p>edit - I am primarily looking for nafka mina's in the two tzdadim of my question. Therefore I am not sure if the question marked as similar will help me. I am also looking for sources one way or the other, for this that question may help, I need to be מעיין in it more.</p>\n<p>edit 2 - I have seen the questions that are similar, but I am still not satisfied, I don't think they answer my question.</p>\n<p>(I was thinking that there might be a nafka mina for arvus (I have seen that there are achronim that discuss this about mitzvos that aren't counted), if the ones that are counted get higher priority than perhaps it is possible to say that arvus only applies to them, so as to be sure to keep the main 'tree' alive and well.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here are some mareh mekomos on this question:</p>\n<p>The Gra's brother in the beginning of Maalos Hatorah quotes the Gra who said that there is no nafka minah regarding the 613 mitzvos, because the number 613 is about roots, but in fact there is an infinite number of mitzvos and the whole discussion of minyan hamitzvos in the rishonim is just about what the roots are (like your 2nd tzad).</p>\n<p>R. Yerucham Perlow in his introduction to his commentary on the Rasag discusses the question of what the nafka minah is. He says that there is no direct nafka minah but there are indirect ones. In other words, he says, since every rishon has to come up with 613 mitzvos, if one is short a few mitzvos, they will have to find additional sources that they would not otherwise have counted as mitzvos to fill in the count, ayen sham.</p>\n<p>R. Zelik Epstein in Yeshurun, vol. 32, also discusses this question and quotes some approaches to it. His own approach is that the reason one is supposed to know what the 613 mitzvos are is because that is part of talmud Torah. In other words, there is a mitzvah to know  the Torah and part of knowing the Torah is knowing what the 613 mitzvos are.</p>\n<p>Others have suggested that there is a nafka minah regarding aseh docheh lo saaseh.</p>\n<p>In a recent podcast, R. Shnayor Burton also discussed this issue. He quoted the Gra, mentioned above, and explained that there is nevertheless a difference between mitzvos that are counted in the list of 613 and those that are only inferred as God's will. Basically, regarding the latter it is our duty to discover God's will but if we have not done so we have only failed in our Torah study; we have not violated an express command. Now printed <a href=\"https://shnayor.substack.com/p/the-land-i-will-show-you-sec-1-chapter-e8d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This seems to be a <em>machlokes</em>.</p>\n<p>The brother of the Vilna Gaon discusses this in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33865&st=&pgnum=31&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maalos Hatorah</a>. He gives the analogy you mention, considering the 613 roots with many hundreds of branches, although he continues to point out that there is no intrinsic relevance in knowing which are 'roots' and which are 'branches'. [See the <em>maalos hatorah</em>* with the commentary of R Yitzchak Isaac Chaver, for more depth.]</p>\n<p>Others (Rambam Teshuvos 141, quoted by Ramban in <em>Shoresh 2</em>; see also Minchas Chinuch in his introduction) do explain that there is an intrinsic value of knowing the count and recognizing which <em>mitzvos</em> do fit into the count. (I understand this is not relevant to your question, I won't elaborate.)</p>\n<p>However, some commentators assume halachic ramifications based on the Count. I'll quote some:</p>\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzlach</a></em> in his commentary to Beitza 19b discusses whether the dictum of <em><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36969/why-does-aseh-doche-lo-saaseh\">aseh docheh lo saaseh</a></em> applies to a <em>mitzva</em> that isn't in the count.</p>\n<p>In Sefer Binyan Adam (<em>Kisui Hadam</em>), the author posits that the laws of forcing one to perform <em>mitzvos</em> does not apply to one which is not part of the 613.</p>\n<p>There is a view in the Rishonim/Kabbalists that every person is obligated to perform all 613 mitzvos at least once in their lifetime (Sefer Chareidim, among others). Accordingly, the count makes a very large difference.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Maimonides wrote the Book of Commandments, or Sefer Hamitzvot (in Arabic: Ketab el Fara'id), where he lists the 613 and comments on each one of them. His list is the one most often used today.  He developed 14 principles to guide him in what commandments to include.  These are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Exclude the seven rabbinic commandments, which were later added to the list: Washing hands before eating bread, building an Eruv, saying a  blessing before eating, lighting Shabbat candles, reading the Megillah scroll on Purim, lighting Hanukkah candles, and reciting the Hallel on major occasions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exclude commandments derived from Rabbi Yishmael's 13 principles of hermeneutics, which derive commandments from other commandments. For example, “Revere Torah scholars.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exclude commandments that are not permanent.  For example, prior to the Exodus from Egypt the Israelites were told: “Put blood on the doors of your houses so the Angel of Death passes over them.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exclude commandments that encompass the entire Torah, such as “Observe all my laws, commandments and decrees, statutes and ordinances.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not consider the reason for a commandment as a separate commandment. For example, “Do not do this and do not bring guilt upon the land.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Count a commandment with both positive and negative components as two.  For example, “Rest on Shabbat” and “Do no work on Shabbat”.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exclude the details of a commandment.  For example, “Bring an animal sin-offering if you can afford it; if not, bring two birds; and if not, bring a flour-offering.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The negation of an obligation is not a prohibition.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>An instruction repeated many times counts only once. For example, “Do  not eat blood” is repeated seven times in the Torah, but counts as only one commandment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exclude the preparations for a commandment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not count the parts of a commandment separately.  For example, the four species required for Sukkot – lulav, etrog, aravah, and hadass – are only one commandment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not count separately the activities required to fulfill a commandment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Count only once a commandment performed over many days.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Count each form of punishment only once, regardless of context.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

For example, when the תורה speaks about כהן המשיח, the translation rendered by אונקלוס is כהנא רבא. Although משיח means \"anointed\" the term is often used to refer to an individual to whom הקב\"ה grants greatness and kingship, hence רבא, which means \"greatness\" in Aramaic. Thus, משיח is rendered by אונקלוס as רב and variants (רבא ,רבו ,רבה).</p>\n<p>Continuing with the background information, there are numerous locations throughout תנ״ך where משיח is called צמח or other terms that are roughly synonymous (i.e. חוטר and שרש are but two examples). It appears as though צמח is also rendered in תרגום as רב or a variant of that root.</p>\n<p>Now to the actual question.</p>\n<p>As is known, תרגום is central to enlightening us regarding the meaning of the biblical text.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I was wondering, what names could be related to צמח so that they would fit as a substitute or replacement for the actual word צמח (as per the various verses, i.e. הנה איש צמח שמו, etc. etc.).</p>\n<p>For example, גידל and פרץ seem potentially related to the definition of צמח.</p>\n<p>While not implying any connection to the ultimate משיח chosen by הקב\"ה, and while the name is a nickname (not a primary name), could רובי (as is the name of Israel's current president, be a variant of צמח?</p>\n<p>It would be especially interesting given how משיח is rendered by תרגום (as רב and variants of that root)</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the question is twofold:</p>\n<p>(1) what names could be related to צמח?\n(2) in particular, is the word רובי related?</p>\n<p>I want to reiterate  that I completely  understand that (i) the names given for משיח are not necessarily names per say but rather descriptive terms regarding virtues or other identifying characteristics.  I fully recognize that. Furthermore,  I mentioned רובי as being the name of the president of Israel only for reference sake, not for any political reason as someone commented. Not at all! In conclusion, I'd still love to hear what names, titles or terms may be relates to the words צמח (or צמיחה). Again, since תרגום renders משיח as רב, it would be interesting if צמח was also connected to that same root (ריבה, רבה, רובי, רוביה, and so on). Thanks!</p>\n<p>P.S.

Some headlines are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though never having studied in traditional yeshivot—being primarily an autodidact he developed a unique Talmudic methodology and was one of the pioneers in what has become known as the Analytical School of Talmudic scholarship...</p>\n<p>...Engel was the un-bifurcated consummate gaon who weaved the various streams of Judaic thought into a cohesive picture. He would use agada to explain halakha, halakha to explain agada and bring Talmudic proofs to Kabbalistic concepts<a href=\"http://www.neirot.com/jewish-prespective-values/some-thought-on-r-yosef-engels-scholarship\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>. For him Torah was a singular unite and the divides between sections was artificial. While at first glance the relationship between sections may not be apparent a deeper look—according to Engel—reveals that inherent association...</p>\n<p>...While many have the ability to locate the central theme of a Talmudic section, Engel had the ability to see how the seemingly trivial aspects of a Talmudic section were central as well. This was due to his study not only analyzing the section under-discussion but locate the conceptual paradigms that were conveyed in it as they pertain to a general Talmudic clause. Engel did not only know Talmud, he was a master of Talmud and employed the keen ability to manipulate the data and trick out new modes of thought...</p>\n<p>One of the central characteristics of Rabbi Yosef Engel’s Halachic methodology is his persistent search for Shoresh HaDin­—the philosophical conceptual roots underlying Halachic ideas.

They quoted a verse: “All flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto you...they shall come up with acceptance upon My altar” (Isaiah 60:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>מאי אותיבו ליה חברוהי would seem evident that this baraisa is in Aramaic (it then quotes a verse in Hebrew).</p>\n<p>Does anyone note/explain this curiosity?

And sometimes we find baraitot that in one place bring teachings of the Tannaim mixed with teachings of the Amoraim, and in another place in the Talmud we find these baraitot where the teachings of the Amoraim are [clearly] separated from the teachings of the Tannaim and stand by themselves...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And one of the examples he brings is the baraita you're quoting. He notes that this teaching of Rabbi Eliezer is not found in the mishna of Parah, nor in the Tosefta, nor, apparently, was it before the eyes of the sages of the Yerushalmi. However, this <em>can</em> be found in the Bavli:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"יתיב ר' אמי ורבי יצחק נפחא אקלעא דר' יצחק נפחא פתח חד מינייהו ואמר וכן היה ר\"א פוסל בכל הקרבנות כולן פתח אידך מינייהו ואמר מאי אותיבו ליה חברוהי לר\"א (ישעיהו ס, ז) כל צאן קדר יקבצו לך וגו' אמר להן ר\"א כולם גרים גרורים הם לעתיד לבא\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.24a.14-15?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 24a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, it seems that the v'tanya here is referring to this story about Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yitzchak Napacha.</p>\n<p>See the rest of his note for other examples.</p>\n\n\n",

This is similar to the case of a Jew who buys a Gentile's vessel (food vessel) for a non-food purpose. Since the buyer does not intend to use it for food purposes, it does not need immersion.</p>\n<p>However, the second Jew who then buys it from the first Jew (who bought it from the Gentile to cut parchments <strong>or</strong> for food purposes but merely for resale and not personal use), for personal purposes of using the utensil for food during a meal, must now \"toivel\" it.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the storekeeper who is not obligated to immerse his utensils he bought from the Gentile for resale, cannot even do you a favor and \"toivel\" them all for you, since an immersion when not required is premature and is of no effect. (SEE: Shailos u' Teshuvos Minchas Yitzchak 8:70; based upon Rema, Yoreh Deah 120:9)</p>\n<p>So what should a person do who buys such a glass cup of mousse and thereby becomes the new owner and wants to eat the mousse from it?</p>\n<p>The Maharal Diskin explains that the laws of immersion of vessels <strong>do not</strong> require one to have to remove the initial food from a dish first, and then immerse it and then put the food back. (SEE: Maharil Diskin Kuntrus Achron 136)</p>\n<p>A good example of this would be buying a bottle of beer or the OP's case of buying a glass cup full of mousse.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for more reasons if the vessel in question is considered disposable. According to many authorities, disposables do not require immersion. (SEE: Chelkas Yaakov 2:47; Minchas Yitzchak 5:32; Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach Zt'zl in Shmiras SHabbos ”KeHilchasa: 9 footnote 41; Igros Moshe (Rabbi Moshe Feinstein Zt'zl) Yoreh Deah 2:40</p>\n<p>I hope this helps your further study; If you have a real practical Halachic question; ask your Local Orthodox Rabbi. :)</p>\n\n\n",

If she will listen, or even if you are not sure about it, you have an obligation to stop her from saying the Lashon Hara<sup>1</sup>. You must be very gentle and sensitive in doing so. <strong>You could just say “Can we please rather speak about something else” or “wait, let’s think of a different topic to chat about”. Just be clear so they get the picture, but gentle so you don’t hurt them in the process.</strong> If they are someone who you know won’t stop so easily and will speak further negativity as a result of your attempt to stop them, then rebuke is forbidden and the best thing to do is leave the conversation. Go to the bathroom, make a phone call, do something to get out of the situation. If this is not an option, then you have no choice but to be strong; you can drift off mentally as they are talking (some people are good at this in non-Lashon hara situations anyway) but at least do not believe what is being said, don’t enjoy what is being said and don’t show your agreement with what is being said<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If you are concerned that the discussion will lead to Lashon Hara - do most the talking. <a href=\"https://hamodia.com/columns/how-to-avoid-speaking-lashon-hara/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hamodia</a> notes two stories that bring this out:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Harav Sorotzkin recounts that he heard from Harav Chaim Ozer Grodzenski that the Chofetz Chaim had a very unique system to ensure that he would not be exposed to hearing forbidden lashon hara. Whenever somebody approached him, <strong>he would immediately begin to discuss words of Torah and mussar with the individual until it was time for the conversation to end, and by actively filling the available time with the mitzvah of Torah study, a convenient side benefit was that there was no possibility of inappropriate gossip being shared</strong>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it is reported that somebody staying at an inn in Europe was told that the illustrious Chofetz Chaim and Gerrer Rebbe were both passing through the inn. Excited to receive their blessings, the man scanned the dining room until he saw a table with two elderly Rabbanim. Unsure about which was the Chofetz Chaim and which was the Gerrer Rebbe, the man observed the two Rabbanim for a few minutes and noticed that one of them was dominating the conversation and doing almost all the talking.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the Chofetz Chaim was renowned for his concern about every word that came out of his mouth, he assumed that the Rav who was listening quietly must be the Chofetz Chaim and approached the table to greet him. To his surprise, the Rav replied that he was speaking to the wrong person, as the Chofetz Chaim was seated across the table. The embarrassed man explained that he was sure that the Rav doing most of the talking couldn’t possibly be the Chofetz Chaim. The Chofetz Chaim responded that people mistakenly assume that in order to avoid sinning in the area of forbidden speech, the only option is to refrain from talking. In reality, somebody who is fluent in the pertinent laws will know what he is permitted to say and will have no problem finding permissible subjects to discuss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This is a mitzvah of Tochacha and is brought in the Chofetz Chaim numerous times. See Hil. Lashon Harah, clal 6, siif 5 and the Beer Mayim Chaim there in the name of Rabeinu Yona.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Ibid, siif 5.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I witnessed my son give the perfect repartee: \"Can we talk about something else\"?</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, it is a well known fact that all trees have a\n“heart” which becomes exposed when you cut down the trunk. The only\nexception to this rule is the olive tree. Perhaps this is the reason\nwhy eating olives led to the person who has consumed them forgetting\nthe Torah he has studied, his heart becoming dull and unresponsive to\nlearning. Our sages have distinguished between the effect of eating\nolives and consuming olive oil. The former has a negative effect even\non matters one has studied for seventy years whereas the latter has a\nbeneficial effect, restoring to one’s memory what one had forgotten\nfor a long time. (Horiot 13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does the \"heart\" of a tree refer to in the sense that the olive tree lacks one? (Extra credit: Why does not having that heart make one forget their learning?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is more a question related to Dendrology, the study of Trees and their taxonomy.</p>\n<p>But learning these details from the natural sciences, חכמת הטבע, is also beneficial in relation to understanding the parallel concepts discussed within the Torah, חכמת התורה.</p>\n<p>For everything in this material, physical world has its root and source which is derived from Above in the letters of the Torah.</p>\n<p>In this particular case, from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 20:19</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֤י הָֽאָדָם֙ עֵ֣ץ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That a Jew is a tree of the field...</p>\n<p>The Heartwood is that section of the tree when viewed in cross-section that is between the pith, meaning the innermost core of the tree and the sapwood. The following photo will illustrate its position in relation to the outer bark and the pith.</p>\n<p>Like is explained in this linked article from <strong><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.01701/full\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frontiers in Plant Science</a></strong>, The primary distinguishing feature of the heartwood is that it provides the quality of resistance to fungal degradation. In other words, it helps to prevent infection and disease which ultimately lead to premature death.</p>\n<p>Like is mentioned in the comments to your original question, The Hearts of Palm are eaten by many people, like is mention in <a href=\"https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/features/hearts-of-palm-food-ingredient\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article from the Michelin Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vk1x22g1mko\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this YouTube video</a> shows how the Hearts of Palm are harvested for food directly from the growing Palm trees and exactly what part of the Palm tree is the edible portion.</p>\n<p>As to the concept that Olive trees lack a heart, based on the Botany section of the article in <a href=\"https://www.crespo-olives.com/pages/history-of-the-olive\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this link to Crespo Olives</a>, it appears that the heartwood of Olive trees is susceptible to fungal degradation, unlike most other trees, and this causes the centers of the older Olive trees to rot away and become hollow.</p>\n<p>The suggestion from Rabbeinu Bechaye that this <em>may indicate</em> why the Sages say eating the fruit of the Olive tree can cause one to forget their Torah learning, which he calls <em>Timtum HaLev</em>, is because the fruit, meaning <em>the offspring (of the parent tree) including the external skin or shell</em> (קליפה) is derived from the innermost essence, the heart, so to speak, of the tree itself (the parent). So consuming the fruit could convey that same unusual quality related to the heartwood of the Olive tree.</p>\n<p>This last idea relates to the Mishnah found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yetzirah 2:2</a> that all that exists and all that will exist are formed from their spiritual root in the Hebrew letters. That the expression <em>Timtum HaLev</em> (טמטם הלב) through the letter transformation called Ic\"k-Bach'ar (אי״ק-בכ״ר), makes the letter Tet exchangeable with the letter Tzadi. Thus, the word Timtum becomes Tzimtzum (צמצם). That <em>Timtum</em> is referring to and an expression of the kabbalistic concept of the first Tzimtzum (צמצום הראשון) at the beginning Creation when the revelation of G-d's presence, <em>meaning that He is one and there is no other</em>, was concealed completely.</p>\n<p>This Tzimtzum took place in order that it was possible for there to be <em>others</em> created, (meaning quite literally the whole of Creation, את השמים ואת הארץ) something that <em>appears to be separate and apart</em> from G-d.</p>\n<p>And this is expressed in the two names that G-d told Moshe to reveal to the Jewish people, when he returned to Egypt, in order that they would know that he was the redeemer that G-d had promised to send them. Those names were אהיה and יהוה.</p>\n<p>That if taken in the order that G-d gave these names to Moshe, אהיה-יהוה, it is found that the inner letters (the heart formed from the union of the two names) are Yud and Heh, literally יהיה. And the A\"t-Ba\"sh (א״ת-ב״ש) letter transformation of those four inner letters is Tzadi-Mem (צמצם) which also alludes to the First Tzimtzum.</p>\n<p>And if looking at the outer letters formed by the union of those two names (<strong>אה</strong>״יה-יה״<strong>וה</strong>), you find the acronym (ראשי תיבות) of <em>the heavens and the earth</em> (<strong>א</strong>ת <strong>ה</strong>שמים <strong>ו</strong>את <strong>ה</strong>ארץ), meaning the whole of Creation.</p>\n<p>That G-d and His name (הוא אחד ושמו אחד) and the Torah are one. There is no other (אין עוד מלבדו).</p>\n<p>And so Rabbeinu Bechaye is suggesting that the eating of the fruits of the Olive tree is analogous to the <em>First Tzimtzum</em>, the concealment of G-d's presence. And that is analogous to forgetting ones Torah that they have learned, even over many years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2mY5e.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2mY5e.jpg\" alt=\"Tree Cross-section\n\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I assume  he means the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pith\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pith.</a> Although it seems like olives also have a pith, but perhaps he believed they don't.</p>\n\n\n",

What none of them address, however, is <em>why</em> in the halacha it is forbidden to enter a church or other non-Jewish place of worship. This question is aimed at understanding the reasoning in the scripture for not entering such a place.</p>\n<p>A few of the above questions make arguments to this point. For example, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/79121/17019\">this answer</a> says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One factor to keep in mind is how close one gets to the building itself as he notes, \" While church services are being held, it is clearly forbidden to enter the church’s parking lot because it may seem to a bystander that one is entering the parking lot in order to enter the church. When church services are not being held, it is permitted to cut through the church’s parking lot...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would seem to indicate that the problem is one of appearances. Were one to enter during off-hours, or in the dark, or ensure one were to remain unseen, perhaps the rule would not apply.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/3667/17019\">This answer</a> states that the prohibition is not against entering church grounds, but rather against entering the sanctuary proper, the specific site of non-Jewish worship:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, it is forbidden for a Jew to enter the sanctuary of the church, i.e. where the actual prayer services are held. As it is a marit ayyin as it could be interpreted as identification with the philosophy. However, it is permitted to enter other rooms in a church for non-religious purposes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Depending on the interpretation of the word \"interpreted\" (which reminds me a bit of Bill Clinton's famous \"It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is\"), and the reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marit_ayin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">marit ayin</a>, this would appear to support the notion that the problem is one of appearances, that being in a church, for example, may cause onlooking Jews to believe that it is permissible to worship as a Christian; of course it is not.</p>\n<p>Is it then to be taken that if one were surrounded entirely by non-Jews, with no Jews present, as is very likely the case in and around a church in a mostly-secular part of the world, that it is permissible to enter a church so long as one does not take part in the worship?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A not-always-known-fact about <em>marit ayin</em> is that it applies <strong>even when no one is watching</strong>. As the Rambam writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbath.22.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Shabbat 22:20</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And [regarding] every place that the Sages forbade [something] on\naccount of appearance, <strong>it is forbidden even in an inner chamber.</strong> [an expression meaning when the person is not seen by others]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.301.45?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 301:45</a>)</p>\n<p>As such, since entering a church is <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/weekly-halacha-5772-bo/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forbidden by many</a>, it doesn't help that there are no Jews around.</p>\n<p>Beyond this R Chaim Palagi (quoted <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2367\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) writes in his Responsa Chaim Be’Yad (Chapter 26) that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When one enters a church, <strong>a spirit of heresy immediately cleaves to\nhim; even if it does not cause one to sin, nevertheless, one\nimpurifies himself just by entering such a place.</strong> [...] One who enters a\nhouse of idol worship requires repentance and atonement for one’s sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The problem is multi-layered. As you cited in your question there's an issue of appearances and making others believe you are taking part in a church activity.</p>\n<p>Another issue is the nature of the location itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Churches are designed for implanting messages into a person's psyche.</strong></p>\n<p>This is extremely true for Catholic churches.</p>\n<p><em>The stonework, the statues, the paintings, the layout, the designs in the windows, the songs they sing, the clothing of the clergy, etc.</em></p>\n<p>These are buildings which have been created for a religious purpose and have been designed to promote a message and to implant that message into your psyche. Even if you reject Christianity consciously, the location is a house of foreign worship and there's a danger in trivializing the nature of the location as harmless. The location is designed to implant foreign teachings into your psyche.</p>\n<p>If you are a religious person, you know the power of ritual and you know the power of surrounding yourself with Jewish ritual. Witnessing the Torah in Shul, lighting shabbat candles, hearing Jews daven, seeing a mezuzah on the door, all of these impart messages and teachings and impact your spiritual psyche as a Jew. This connection to your environment and your space of worship imparts something within you.</p>\n<p><strong>The same is true of Christian houses of worship.</strong></p>\n<p>It can be argued that standing inside of a church and looking around is like reading the New Testament in a certain sense. It's imparting a religious message and impacting you psychologically even if you aren't aware of it. The risk of that is great enough that the Rabbis ban us from entering them for the sake of protecting us from that risk.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4091056/jewish/Why-Cant-Jews-Attend-Church-Funerals.htm#footnote2a4091056\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I'm attaching a Chabad article which touches upon this question.</a></strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi says that a Church is a place of idols and a Reform shul is even worse. He says a mosque is ok. I disagree. A Jewish temple is preferable to another religion's place of worship, especially when Arabs are anti-semites right now.</p>\n\n\n",

He felt that Abraham knew the Torah by prophecy. Accordingly, the patriarchs, although not obligated, asked G-d if they could keep the entire Torah, even though it would not be revealed centuries later.</p>\n<p>Maimonides disagreed. According to the Rambam, Abraham did not have the Torah. He felt that Abraham had only the Seven Noahide Laws plus eight for circumcision (eight mitzvot)[2]. It is possible that the rabbinical opinion that the patriarchs observed the Torah was hyperbolic; designed to highlight the importance of Torah observance. It is not meant to be taken literally.  The Torah did not exist during the days of the patriarchs. If Abraham or Noah kept the Torah the Torah would have mentioned it.</p>\n<p>[1] See Genesis Rabbah 79:7, 92:4, and 95:2, the Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 21.</p>\n<p>[2] See Mishneh Torah (Hilkhot Shmitah v’Yovel, 13:11).</p>\n\n\n",

I recently learned this was not the case in every community, some wait only for Kiddush, others don't wait at all.</p>\n<p>What are the halachic considerations behind these three views?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R David Brofsky (in his book <a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/hilkhot-moadimhardcover\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilkhot Mo'adim</a>, p. 573 and <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/halakha/orach-chaim/holidays/customs-shavuot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> online) brings sources on all sides of the debate. I have somewhat restructured the text to group opinions and added the sub-titles in bold.</p>\n<p><strong>(1) Those who argue one can pray before dark but need to wait for Kiddush</strong></p>\n<p>R. Yeshayahu Horowitz (1565–1630), the Shelah, writes in his Shenei Luchot Ha-Brit (Masechet Shavuot):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I received [a tradition] from my teacher, the Gaon R. Shlomo of\nLublin, who received [this tradition] person to person from the Gaon\nR. Yaakov Pollack, [that one should] not make Kiddush and eat on the\nfirst night of Shavuot until after the stars have appeared. The reason\nis because it says regarding the counting [of the omer], “Seven\ncomplete weeks there should be;” if one recites Kiddush while it is\nstill day, one slightly detracts from the 49 days of sefirat ha-omer,\nand Shavuot is supposed to be [observed] after the [full] count.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This tradition dates back to R. Yaakov Pollack (1460–1561), the forefather of the Polish rabbinic tradition. Interesting, R. Horowitz writes that even though one may not recite Kiddush before nightfall, one may still recite the evening prayers early, as even on Shabbat, one may recite the prayers of Motzaei Shabbat on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham (494), however, as well as the Peri Chadash (494), cites the Shelah, writing that one should not recite Kiddush until after dark.</p>\n<p><strong>(2) Those who argue one can pray and recite Kiddush before dark</strong></p>\n<p>R. Yosef Hahn (Frankfurt am Main, 1570-1637), a contemporary of R. Horowitz, records (Yosef Ometz 850) that he had not seen this practice in Germany. Furthermore, he argues this practice is not only an unnecessary stringency, but it also takes away from the time one could learn at night, as the night is relatively short during the summer. This seems to have continued to have been the practice in Germany thereafter as well, as R. Netanel Weil (1687–1769) writes in his comments to the Rosh, the Korban Netanel (Pesachim 10:2), that one may recite Kiddush and eat while it is still light on all Festival days, including Shavuot.</p>\n<p>R. Yaakov Emden (1697– 776), in his Siddur Yaavetz, insists that, on the contrary, one should pray before dark in order to fulfill the mitzva of adding from the weekday onto Shabbat and Yom Tov (tosefet Shabbat).</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Those who argue one should wait until dark to pray</strong></p>\n<p>Although these early authorities only mention delaying Kiddush until evening, the Taz (494) records that the congregation delays beginning Arvit so that the count should be “complete.”</p>\n<p>R. Shimon Sofer, in his Hitorerut Teshuva (56), suggests a different reason to delay Arvit; we should wait until night to ensure that even those who will stay up the entire night will not forget to recite Keri’at Shema after dark, its proper time. Similarly, R. Natan Gestetner (Responsa Lehorot Natan 7:31) suggests that Arvit is not recited until dark simply to ensure that people do not recite kiddush before dark. Numerous Acharonim, such as the Peri Megadim (Mishbetzot Zahav 494, s.v. me’acharin), the Shulchan Arukh Ha-Rav (494:2), the Kitzur Shulchan Arukh (120:11) and the Mishna Berura (494:1), rule that one should not recite Arvit until after dark.</p>\n<p>R. Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin, the Netziv, offers another suggestion in his commentary to the Torah (Ha-Amek Davar, Vayikra 23:21). The Torah says that one observes Shavuot “be-etzem ha-yom ha-zeh” – “this very same day” – in order to teach that there is no mitzva of tosefet Shabbat on Shavuot. We learn that we should observe Shavuot after dark from this verse, and not in order to ensure than our “count” is complete.</p>\n\n\n",

I wonder therefore: but according to Rambam, then, in what sense do the souls of the righteous live eternally at HaShem in the olam ha ba?</p>\n\n\n",

The most preferable way of performing the mitzvah is to bring each type of fruit in a separate container. If one brings them [all] in one container, he has fulfilled his obligation. [Even in such an instance,] he should not bring them mixed together. Instead, he should bring the barley below, wheat on top of it, olives on top of it, dates on top of them, pomegranates on top of them, and figs on the top of the container. There should be a substance, e.g., palm leaves, wild grass, or leaves, or the like, that intervenes between each type of produce.

The Ran says the former, is the ultimate מעלות השכלית. A footnote in the Artscroll edition states the assertion is implied and doesn’t need proof. By moral virtues, מעלות המידות, he goes out of his way to prove this assertion and uses the aforementioned braita to prove humility is the sublime state of moral virtue. In passing, we see being a חכם is a separate and distinct virtue.</p>\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n<p>1.) Is there a braita, like that of Rabbi Pinchas Ben Yair , but enumerating the intellectual virtues? If not\n2.) Does any Gaon, Rishon, or Acharon make mention of this omission?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a kofer be a dayan on a giyur beis din?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Assuming a person meets the Rambam's definition of a kofer as outlined in Hilchos Teshuvah Chapter 3, can such a person serve as dayan on a giyur beis din?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No,the bais din needs to be comprised of 3 kosher Jews and it is learned from the passuk in bamidbar 15 (משפט אחד יהיה לכם...) and the word משפט means 3 kosher Jews(Yevamos 46b) . See Yoreh Deah 268:3 with the Shach (8) .</p>\n<p>For further laws see Choshen Mishpat siman 7,and 34 which discusses who is disqualified for becoming a Dayan and witness .</p>\n<p>Text of Shach:</p>\n<p>צריך שיהיו בשלשה הכשרים. דכתיב גבי גר משפט אחד יהיה לכם ואין משפט בפחות מג' כשרים:</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The appropriate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.181.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch is 181:2</a> which discusses the subject of going before a secular court, as opposed to a properly constituted Jewish Beit Din.</p>\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Laws of Foreign Worship 2:5</a> explains that a Jew who is in the category of a kofer is not treated as a Jew, but as a non-Jew in all matters. Since the basis of your theoretical question is based on Rambam's definition of a kofer, the answer would evolve from that source.</p>\n<p>Based on your profile picture, you seem to hold Rav Ganzfried, the author of Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in esteem.</p>\n<p>He explains that submitting to a court comprised of such people is like is found in the section of Kitzur Shulchan Aruch quoted above. He emphasizes that such courts may even judge and operate seemingly in accordance with Jewish law. Nevertheless, it is prohibited to use them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Numbering in the Mordechai\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've noticed that the Mordechai has a strange numbering system (א,ב,ג etc.) that goes through it. I thought it might just be enumerating the individual halachos l'maaseh, but I noticed that it often appears mid-phrase in the Mordechai, suggesting that it's not just a numbering system. I looked around for something that it might be referencing, like another commentary, but it doesn't seem to point anywhere specific. For example, you can see the numbering in the first paragraph here going from עג to עח:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KU1ng.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KU1ng.jpg\" alt=\"Mordechai\" /></a></p>\n<p>Where are numbers these pointing to? What does it represent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is a great question, as it exposes the problem with the Mordechai, one of the thorniest medieval texts in terms of the significantly different versions and abridgments produced over the generations, which make an authoritative version of this thirteenth-century compilation of Ashkenazic laws and customs quite challenging.</p>\n<p>The numbering system you refer to developed out of Italian editions produced in the mid-16th century that included the Rif, Mordechai, and Tosefa in one book. <strong>R. Yehoshua Boaz</strong>, a Spanish exile who moved to Italy and wrote the commentary to the Mordechai called <em>Shiltei Hagibborim</em>, numbered the Mordechai in order to make the work an accessible companion to the laws of the Rif. Later editions of the Mordechai and the Rif corrupted this numbering system, exacerbated by the loss of a work Boaz made of this numbering system.</p>\n<p>This information is based on the wonderful research of Avraham Halperin. He explains the complicated textual history of the Mordechai and its commentaries in the Machon Yerushalmi edition of the Mordechai, a revised, critical edition that relies on several archived manuscripts. It is there, in the introductory volume (pp. 37-38), that he writes the following paragraphs (with my quick translation of the relevant information):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא עברו אלא כשלשים שנה מעת הדפסת הרי\"ף, עם המרדכי והתוספתא בוונציה\nכנ\"ל והנה התחילו בעת ובעונה אחת שני בתי דפוס באיטליה להכין מהדורא חדשה\nמהם. בית הדפוס האחד הוא של הנוצרי אלויזי בראגאדין בוונציה, והשני - של\nהמדפיס היהודי טוביה פואה בסביוניטה בדפוס בראגאדין הופיע הספר בשנת שי\"ב\n(1552) ובסביוניטה - בשנים שי\"ד-שי\"ט  (1554-1559). הטכסט בשניהם - גם של\nהרי\"ף, גם של המרדכי וגם של התוספתא  - מועתק מדפוס וונציה ואף סדר הדפים\nוהעמודים בהם הוא כמותו (ורק לעתים יש הבדל קל ביניהם, המתבטא בהעברת\nשורה אחת או שתיים מסופו של עמוד אחד אל ראשיתו של משנהו). בשניהם הופיע\nהספר בשלשה חלקים. החידוש המיוחד שהוכנס בהם הוא כפול: ציון ההלכות - גם\nברי\"ף וגם במרדכי - באותיות לפי סדר הא\"ב והוספת פירוש בשם ״שלטי\nהגבורים״ אף הוא בשניהם. ההלכות צויינו על ידי הדפסת מעגל קטן ליד מילת\nהמפתח בפנים והאות בשוליים בצד. בכל אחד משלשת החלקים ערוכים סימני\nהאותיות בסדר שוטף מתחילה. סידור זה, וכן הפירוש הנ\"ל הם פרי עבודתו של\nרבי יהושע בועז, בעל התורה אור, העין משפט והנר מצוה שעל הגמרא. בהקדמתו\nלמהדורא זו (והיא העתקה לרוב המהדורות הבאות של הרי\"ף ונמצאת גם אתו בראש\nהרי\"ף למסכת ברכות שבדפוסי הש\"ס דירן) כותב יהושע בועז, שהוא מיין וריכז\nאת כל הדינים שבתלמוד בשני חלקים: ״עצות בנפשי שמתי לתת בסדר על ספר\nתמי\"ם כל הדינים הפשוטים בלי מחלוקת וגמגומים וכל הדינים אשר בהן מחלוקת\nלהציגן כסדרן על ספר המחלו״קת״. וכוונתו היתה כדבריו שם: ״לערוך שלחן מכל\nהפוסקים אשר מתוך התלמוד הוציאו פסקים צדיקים, וסביב לו איש על מקומו\nבאותות אמרתי להקים, ואזי בשטיטת עין אחת ימצא איה איפה בספר דבריהם\nחקוקים״. מפרי עבודתו (אולי כהכנה לספרים המתוכננים הללו) נתברכנו במראי\nמקום כל דין שעליו פסק האלפסי ברב חילו, איפא (!) הביאו אותו בחבורים\nמיימון וסמ\"ג (ספר מצוות גדול) וטור באותות גדול על דגלו, כפי סדר שכתבתי\nלמעלה סביבו כתבתיהו, ולו שם עין משפט קראתיהו, גם לכל דין אות מאלפא\nביתא למנין שם חקקתיהו, לנר כל מצוה שם הצגתיהו. אולם הקובץ המרוכז של כל\nההלכות הללו במסגרת ״ספר חקר דינים״ של התלמוד, המבטח לנו בהמשך דבריו שם\nלא הגיע  לידינו</p>\n<p>לעומת זאת, מעבודת הסימון המקבילה שנעשתה על ידו לרי\"ף ולמרדכי (כדבריו שם: ״ועשיתיו לקצות פסקי הרי\"ף הנ\"ל סמני חקר דינין וסדרתיהו להלכותיו וכן ספר האשר\"י ז\"ל סדרתי סי' כל פסק דין שלו בדגלו לאותותיו וכן קיצור ספר מרדכי סדרתיהו להלכות בסימניו עם הגהותיו״)  נדפסו\nבשתי המהדורות הללו בראגאדין וסביוניטה לוחות הדינים לשניהם</p>\n<p>הלוחות לספר המרדכי יצאו גם אחר כך בהוצאה נפרדת בשם ״קיצור מרדכי\nוסימניו״. בדפוס וויצנטו קונסי בקרימונה, בשנת שי\"ז (1557). ואמנם חלוקת\nסימני הדינים שבלוחות אלה לפני אותיותיהם מתאימה בדיוק לסימנים שליד\nהטכסט ברי\"ף ובמרדכי</p>\n<p>הדפוסים המאוחרים נהגו בתחילה להעתיק על פי מהדורה זו את סימני האותיות\nבשולי הטכסט (ולא תמיד הדפיסו את לוחות חיקור הדינים) ואחר כך - בתוך\nהטכסט עצמו (כגון בדפוס ווארשה תרי\"ט-תרכ\"א, למברג שעם הש\"ס תר\"ך-תרכ\"ה\nובדפוסי ווילנא-ראם המאוחרים). כיון שסימני האותיות הללו נסובים רק על\nההלכות המצויות והמפוזרות בטכסט הרי שאין כל קשר ביניהם לבין חלוקתו של\nהטכסט לפיסקאות או לסעיפים. קורה להן, שבפיסקה מסויימת יש כמה סימני\nאותיות וכנגדה, בפיסקה אחרת שאין בה הלכה התואמת את המובא ברמב\"ם, אין כל\nציון. כמו כן באים כרגיל סימני האותיות הנ\"ל ליד מילות המפתח ולאו דווקא\nבראשי הפיסקאות שם. בגלל חוסר חלוקה מגדרת של הטכסט גם ברי\"ף וגם במרדכי\nהשתרש הנוהג לציין את המקומות בשניהם לפי סימני אותיות אלה לראות בהם\nמעין ציוני סעיפים, למרות שאין הם עונים כלל וכלל על כך</p>\n<p>Not thirty years since the Rif was printed alongside the Mordechai and\nthe Tosefta in Venice, as mentioned above, that two printing houses in\nItaly began to make a new edition of them at the same time. The first\nprinting house was by the Christian, Alvise Bragadin in Venice, and the\nother by the Jewish printer Tuvia Foa in Sabbioneta, the book appeared\nin the Bragadin printing press in 1552 and in Sabbioneta in the years\n1554-1559.</p>\n<p>The text in both editions - each with the Rif, the\nMordechai and the Tosefta - was copied from Venice, and even the order\nof the pages is the same (and only sometimes there is a slight\ndifference between them, which is expressed by moving one or two lines\nfrom the end of one page to the beginning of another). In both\neditions, the book appeared in three parts. The special innovation\nintroduced in them is twofold: <strong>the marking of the laws - both in the\nRif and in Mordechai - in letters according to the order of the\nalphabet</strong> and the addition of a commentary with the name \"Shiltei\nHagibborim\" in both.</p>\n<p>The laws were indicated by printing a small\ncircle next to the keyword on the inside and the letter on the side\nmargins. In each of the three parts the letter marks are arranged in a\nstarting order. <strong>This arrangement, as well as the aforementioned\ncommentary, are the fruit of the work of Rabbi Yehoshua Boaz</strong>, the\nauthor of \"HaTorah Or\", the \"Ein Mishpat\" and the \"Ner Mitzva\" on the\nGemara. In his introduction to this edition (and it is a copy of most\nsubsequent editions of the Rif and it is also at the\nbeginning of the Rif on Tractate Brakhot in the printed editions of\nShas), Yehoshua Boaz writes that he sorted and summarized all the laws\nin the Talmud ...However, the abridged compilation of all these laws in\nthe \"Sefer Heqer Dinim\" of the Talmud, assures us later in his remarks\nthere, that these works have been lost.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, from the parallel numbering work done by Boaz for the Rif\nand the Mordechai ... in both of these editions, Bragadin and Sabbioneta\nprinted the lists of laws for each of them.</p>\n<p>...Indeed, the division of the laws in these lists are according to\nletters that correspond exactly to the signs next to the text in the\nRif and in the Mordechai.</p>\n<p><strong>Subsequent editions started copying this edition, incorporating the\nalphabetically ordered arrangement on the margins of the text (and did\nnot always print the lists of the laws) and later - within the text\nitself (such as in the Warsaw and Vilna editions). Since these letter\nmarks revolve only on laws found and scattered throughout the text,\nthere is no connection between them and the division of the text's\nparagraphs or sections. Sometimes a certain paragraph  will have\nseveral letter marks and, by contrast, another paragraph that has no\nlaws corresponding to what is presented in the Rambam, doesn't have\nany.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Likewise, the aforementioned letter marks appear next to keywords and\nnot necessarily at the beginning of the paragraphs there.</strong> Due to the\nlack of a defined division in both the texts of the Rif and the\nMordechai, it has become customary to indicate the places in both\naccording to the lettered numbers to see as kinds of section markers,\neven though they do not correspond with each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In addition to Tamir's note on Rashi's commentary (to Megillah 3a) - that Daniel was not technically considered a prophet since he didn't publicly declare his visions to the Jewish people - here are a few other explanations.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Rambam</strong> offers an intermediate position - arguing that Daniel had a \"second degree\" of prophecy, like David and Solomon (cf. Guide II:45). A vision in a dream may be inspired by Ruach Hakodesh, but not necessarily prophecy, especially if that person doesn't understand what they experienced. Regarding this \"second degree,\" the Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It consists in the fact that an individual finds that a certain thing\nhas descended upon him and that another force  has come upon him\nand has made him speak; so that he talks in wise  sayings, in words\nof praise, in useful admonitory dicta, or concerning governmental or\ndivine matters-and all this while he is  awake and his  senses\nfunction as usual.  Such an individual is said to speak through the\nHoly Spirit.</p>\n<p>...Similarly you will find that Daniel applies to them the expression \"dreams,\" even though he saw an angel in those dreams and heard words spoken in them. He calls them dreams even after he has received knowledge through them. Thus it says:  T<em>hen  was the  secret  revealed  unto  Daniel in a  vision of the night</em>. It also  says:  <em>Then  he wrote the dream, and so on</em>; <em>I  saw in my vision by night, and so on</em>; <em>And the visions of my head affrighted  me</em>. And he says: <em>And I  was appalled at the vision, but understood it not</em>. There is  no doubt that this grade is  below the grade of those of whom it is  said: <em>I  do speak  with him in a  dream</em> [Num. 12:6].  For this reason the nation has reached a  consensus  to put the book of Daniel among the Writings, and not among the Prophets. For this reason  I  called your attention to the fact that in the kind of prophecy that came to Daniel and Solomon, they did not discover in their souls - even though they saw an angel in a dream - that this was a pure prophecy, but rather that <strong>this was a dream communicating the true reality of certain matters</strong>. This is characteristic of the group of people who speak through the Holy Spirit. This is the second degree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Ramban</strong> (Gen. 18:1) strongly disagrees with Rambam's understanding of prophecy. Daniel did have visions when he was awake <em>and</em> asleep. In any case, the explanation that Daniel was not a prophet, according to the Ramban, is that his message came through a vision of the angel Gabriel. Angels transcend human perception, and a vision of one indicates a lack of pure prophecy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובאמת כי כל מקום שהוזכר בכתוב ראיית מלאך או דבור מלאך הוא במראה או בחלום כי ההרגשים לא ישיגו המלאכים אבל לא מראות הנבואה כי המשיג לראות מלאך או דיבורו איננו נביא ... וכן לא נכתב ספרו עם ספר הנביאים מפני שהיה עניינו עם גבריאל אף על פי שהיה נראה אליו ומדבר עמו בהקיץ כמו שנאמר במראה של בית שני ועוד אני מדבר בתפלה והאיש גבריאל (דניאל ט כא) וכן המראה של קץ הגאולה (שם י ד) בהקיץ היתה בלכתו עם חביריו על יד הנהר</p>\n<p>In truth, wherever Scripture mentions an angel being seen or heard speaking it is in a vision or in a dream for the human senses cannot perceive the angels. But these are not visions of prophecy since <strong>he who attains the vision of an angel or the hearing of his speech is not yet a prophet</strong>... [Daniel's] book, likewise, was not grouped together with the books of the prophets since his affair was with the angel Gabriel, even though he appeared to him and spoke with him when he was awake, as it is said in the vision concerning the second Temple: <em>Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, etc.</em> The vision concerning the ultimate redemption also occurred when Daniel was awake as he walked with his friends beside the Tigris River.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another way to understand the sages' statement on Daniel, and the status of the Book of Daniel among the Ketuvim, is to consider the contextual location, authorship, and time of Daniel's visions in Bavel. This can be understood by two other teachings from <strong>Rashi</strong>. As Rashi explains in Bava Batra 15a, Daniel's visions were written close to when prophesy ended completely, a time when the Ruach Hakodesh was waning. Furthermore, it was only written/published by the Great Assembly in the Land of Israel, at a later time from when they originally happened:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תבו יחזקאל - שנתנבא בגולה ואיני יודע למה לא כתבו יחזקאל בעצמו אם לא מפני שלא נתנה נבואה ליכתב בחוצה לארץ וכתבום אלו לאחר שבאו לארץ וכן ספר דניאל שהיה בגולה וכן מגילת אסתר ושנים עשר מתוך שהיו נבואותיהם קטנות לא כתבום הנביאים עצמם איש איש ספרו ובאו חגי זכריה ומלאכי וראו שרוח הקדש מסתלקת שהיו הם נביאים אחרונים ועמדו וכתבו נבואותיהם וצרפו נבואות קטנות עמם ועשאום ספר גדול שלא יאבדו מחמת קטנם</p>\n<p>They [the members of the Great Assembly] wrote Ezekiel — for he prophesied in exile. And I do not know why Ezekiel didn't write it himself, if not because prophecy is not allowed to be written outside of the Land, so they wrote them after they came to the land. And thus the book of Daniel, which was in exile, and thus the Scroll of Esther and the Twelve of minor prophecies — the prophets did not write it together, but rather each wrote their own book. And Ḥaggai, Zecharia, and Malachi came and saw that the Holy Spirit was withdrawing, that they were the last prophets, and they arose and wrote their prophecies and attached the minor prophecies with them, and made them a great book that would not be lost because of their small size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi, in Ezekiel 1:3, also explains that Ezekiel first received his prophecy in Israel, which allowed him to later prophesy in exile:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואומר אני שאותה נבואה נאמר' לו קודם שגלו שהיא ראויה ליאמר לו בארץ שאין מפורש בה גולה והיא נכרת תחלת שליחתו אליהם ויונתן אף הוא כך תירגם מהוי הוי פתגם נבואה מן קדם ה' עם יחזקאל בר בוזי כהנא בארעא דישראל תב תניינות אתמלל עמיה במדינת ארעא כשדאי</p>\n<p>I say that this [Ezekiel's] prophecy was told to him before they were exiled, because <strong>it is worthy to be said to him in the Land</strong>, for the community of the exile is not mentioned explicitly in it. It can be recognized as the beginning of his mission to them. Jonathan [Targum], too, paraphrased in that manner: The prophetic word from before the Lord was revealed to Ezekiel the son of Buzi the Cohen in the land of Israel; it returned a second time and spoke with him in the state of the land of the Chaldeans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If, according to Rashi, prophecy must <em>first</em> be experienced in the Land of Israel, it would appear that Daniel's visions, which happened exclusively in exile, are thus not considered prophecy. This is how Rashi maintains that Ezekiel <em>was</em> a prophet, by arguing that Ezekiel first received prophecy in Israel (as did other prophets who prophesied outside the land, such as Jonah).</p>\n<p>For what it's worth, some of the earliest post-Biblical Jewish literature similarly classified Daniel a prophet. This includes the Septuagint, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, who is most emphatic about Daniel, writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Daniel was] one of the greatest prophets, and during his lifetime he received honor and esteem from kings and people, and, since his death, his memory lives on eternally. For the books which he wrote and left behind are still read by us even now, and we are convinced by them that Daniel spoke with God, for he was not only wont to prophesy future things, as did the other prophets, but he also fixed the time at which these would come to pass. And, whereas the other prophets foretold disasters and were for that reason in disfavor with kings and people, Daniel was a prophet of good tidings to them, so that through the auspiciousness of his predictions he attracted the goodwill of all, while from their realization he gained credit among the multitude for his truthfulness and at the same time won their esteem for his divine power. And he left behind writings in which he has made plain to us the accuracy and faithfulness to truth of his prophecies. (<em>Jewish Antiquities</em> ch.10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Josephus should always be taken with a grain of salt.

Sections for these individuals existed. <a href=\"https://www.anumuseum.org.il/the-ancient-synagogue-of-sardis-turkey/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">We have a synagogue in Turkey from the 3rd century</a> which has an engraving indicating it was a house of worship for Jews and for gentiles who weren't Jewish but acknowledged Hashem and Judaism as truth. If we shared spaces of worship with non-Jews, it's possible some of our knowledge trickled out through word of mouth. People talk.</li>\n<li><strong>It's possible this information was stolen by Christians.</strong> Jewish persecutions have existed throughout history. When Christianity became the official religion of the Romans, we became a target and remained a target throughout much of history. <strong>Judah Ha-Nasi <em>(the Rabbi who led the writing of the Oral Torah to preserve Judaism)</em> lived from 135 to 217 CE</strong>. This was well before the 7th century which meant it's possible these written records of Jewish tradition had begun getting leaked into Christian society. Once you write an idea down, it ceases existing within the nation. That was partly why we resisted doing so for so long.</li>\n<li><strong>The most logical explanation however is the first Christians were originally Jewish.</strong> Christianity was considered a renegade sect of Judaism in the very early part of their history. The Romans described them as such. If they were originally Jews then it's extremely likely they had an education in Jewish teachings and traditions which they then appropriated into the Christian religion. I mean, Jesus was himself a Jew. We know for a fact that for a very short period of time in Jewish history there were Jews who kept Jewish law but also endorsed idolatry of believing in Jesus. These people were eventually phased out and they formed their own church. The point still stands they likely were knowledgable in our traditions and took those with them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these is plausible and they could all be true and just one piece of a larger history.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Some scholars think that the talmudic stories found in midrashim are actually copies of Greek stories. If this is true it might explain how the non-Jews were able to record the same stories.</p>\n<p>If this is not true then the rabbis probably wanted to impart wisdom to the nations.</p>\n\n\n",

They brought him <strong>three hundred jugs</strong> of oil, for light and food, up to his upper story, and he sat isolated in the upper story and did not move from there until he homiletically interpreted all of those verses in the book of Ezekiel that seemed contradictory, and resolved the contradictions.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.13b.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 13b</a>) If Nedavai/Nervai/Garbai is a nickname rather than his father's name, then it would still be plausible that Chananyah's father was really called Chizkiyah.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I was wondering whether there were any Orthodox sources that identify one with the other, or discuss why they are not the same person?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> According to this, all three variants of the nickname make sense: Nedavai - because he was נדיב, generous. Nervai - as in ריבוי, either because of the plentiness of the offerings in his time or because of the many priests he managed to feed.

    "content": "# Looking for sources that explain why monotheism is true (as opposed to paganism) and how to attain that knowledge\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom.</p>\n<p>I am looking for sources (a list if possible) that explain why monotheism, as opposed to paganism, is true. I would also like to know how to attain that knowledge.</p>\n<p>I am aware that Chovos Halevavos is an authoritative source on the subject, but wish to know whether this question has been addressed by others (and if so, by whom and where).</p>\n<p>Many thanks for your time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This first place to look is the Torah itself. I would say that this is the primary purpose of the stories of the Exodus and the song of Haazinu. Also, the sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Da%27at_Tevunoth.34?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Tevunos</a> deals with clarifying this issue and seeking demonstration of monotheism in history:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(לד) אמר השכל - עתה כשנשיב אל לבנו כל סדרי מעשיו ית', כל המעשה הגדול אשר עשה מני שים אדם עלי ארץ, וכל אשר הבטיח לנו לעשות ע\"י נביאיו הקדושים, הנה מה שמתברר לנו מכל זה בירור גמור - הוא עוצם יחודו יתברך.</p>\n<p>(34) Said the Intellect - Now that we have returned to your hearts the order of HaShem's actions may he be blessed, All of the great actions He has done since placing man upon the earth (Job 20:4), and everything that her promised us to do through the holy prophets, behold that which is clear to us from this with complete clarity - is the might of His singularity may He be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל יחודו, אדרבא, זה מתגלה ומתברר לנו בירור גמור. ונמשך לנו מזה שלא די שהוא מתברר לנו, אלא שחייבים אנחנו להשיב אל לבנו הידיעה הזאת, לתקוע אותה בלבבנו בישוב גמור בלי שום פקפוק כלל. והוא מה שמצוינו משה רבנו ע\"ה מפי הגבורה (דברים ד, לט), \"וידעת היום והשבות אל לבבך כי ה' הוא האלהים בשמים ממעל ועל הארץ מתחת אין עוד\". ופי עליון מעיד בעצמו ומודיע כי כל הנלקט מכל מסיבותיו הגדולות אשר הוא מתהפך בעולמו, הלא הוא גילוי יחודו הגמור הזה; כענין אמרו (דברים לב, לט), \"ראו עתה כי אני אני הוא ואין אלהים עמדי\", ומקרא זה נאמר אחר שכלל כל סיבוב הגלגל, שהיה עתיד ומזומן להיות סובב בעולם, שנכלל הכל בדברי השירה ההיא של האזינו, וכמו שפשטן של כתובים עצמן מוכיח, והנה חותם החזון שלו חתם בלשון הזה, \"ראו עתה כי אני אני הוא\" וגו'. ובדברי הנביא ישעיה נתבאר בהדיא (ישעיה מג, י יא), \"למען תדעו ותאמינו לי ותבינו כי אני הוא, לפני לא נוצר אל ואחרי לא יהיה. אנכי אנכי ה' ואין מבלעדי מושיע\"; וכמו שכתוב (ישעיה מד, ו), \"אני ראשון ואני אחרון ומבלעדי אין אלהים\"; וכמו שכתוב (ישעיהו מה, ו ז), \"למען ידעו ממזרח שמש וממערבה כי אפס בלעדי אני ה' ואין עוד. יוצר אור ובורא חשך עושה שלום ובורא רע, אני ה' עושה כל אלה\". והנה \"למען ידעו\", \"למען תדעו ותבינו\" כתיב, משמע שרוצה שנדע בידיעה והבנה. ותכלית כל ההצלחה שהוא מבטיח לישראל הוא התברר יחודו לעיני הכל. ודבר זה נזכר פעמים אין מספר בדברי הנביאים ע\"ה (ישעיהו ב, יא), \"ונשגב ה' לבדו ביום ההוא\"; (זכריה יד, ט), \"והיה ה' למלך וגו' ביום ההוא יהיה ה' אחד ושמו אחד\"; (צפניה ג, ט), \"כי אז אהפוך אל עמים לקרוא כלם בשם ה' לעבדו שכם אחד\". וסוף דבר, הלא זה עדותנו בכל יום תמיד (דברים ו, ד), \"שמע ישראל ה' אלהינו ה' אחד\":</p>\n<p>35 But His singularity, is just the opposite, it is revealed and clarified focus in complete clarity. And it emerges for us from this that it is not enough that it be clear to us, but that we are obligated to return this knowledge to our hearts, to embed it in our hearts completely settled without any doubt. And this is what we were commanded by Moshe our teacher may he rest in peace from the mouth of The Mighty One (Deuteronomy 4:39), \"And you shall know today and return to your hearts that HaShem He is the G-d in the heavens above and on the earth below, there is no other\". And the mouth of the One on high himself testifies and informs us that everything that is gathered from all the great occurrences that He overturns in his world, is it not the complete revelation of this - His singularity; as it says (Deuteronomy 32:39) \"See now that I, I am He and there is no other G-d with me\", and this passage is said after He included all the future revolutions of the globe that are planned to occur in the universe, that include everything in the words of this song of HaAzinu, and like the straightforward meaning of these writings themselves prove, and behold the ending of His vision ends with this language, \"See now that I, I am He\" etc. And in the words of the prophet Isaiah it is described explicitly (Isaiah 43:10-11), \"In order that you know and believe me and understand that I am He, before me no G-d was created and there will be no other after me. I, I am hashed and there is no savior other than me\"; and as it is written (Isaiah 44:6), \"I am first and I am last and there is no G-d other than me\"; and as it says (Isaiah 45:6-7), \"In order that you know from the the east and the west that there is nothing other than me, I am HaShem and there is no other. The maker of light and creator of darkness making peace and creating the negative, I am hashed the maker of all of these\". And behold, it is written \"In order that you know\", In order that you know and understand\", meaning that He wants us to know with knowledge and understanding. And the purpose of all of the success that He promises to Israel is the explanation of His singularity to the eyes of all. And this matter is mentioned innumerable times in the words of the prophets may they rest in peace, (Isaiah 2:11), \"...and haShem will be exalted on that day.\"; (Zechariah 14:9) \"And haShem will be king [on all the earth] haShem will be one and His name will be one\"; (Zephania 3:9) \"For then I will overturn the peoples to all call in the the name of haShem and to worship him as one accord\". And in the end, is this not always our testimony every day (Deuteronomy 6:4) \"Hear O' Israel HaShem our G-d HaShem is One\":\nA general point that is critical for this question: make sure you are clear on the question before you put effort into discovering the answer!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As you say, paganism involves identifying deities who are exaggerated super-human forms, e.g. Thor, Zeus et al.

Supposing that there are many deities is equivalent to an admission that they are corporeal, because like individual beings do not differ save in chance traits characteristic of bodies and material things only. Thus supposing the Creator to be corporeal and material would force a conclusion that He is finite, for, it is impossible to imagine a body which does not end in dissolution; but our God, blessed is His Name! beholding that His power is infinite and uninterrupted, for lo, the universal sphere continues to revolve forever. His power is positively not a physical power. And, because He is Incorporeal, none of the chance traits, characteristic of bodies, so as to be divisible or an offshoot of another being, can be attributed to Him. Therefore, the impossibility for Him to be but One. And, the knowledge of this doctrine of Monotheism is a mandatory commandment, saying: \"The Lord our God is One God\" (Deut. 6.4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would bet that the Rambam elaborates in Moreh Nevichim, but I am not sufficiently familiar with that sefer.</p>\n\n\n",

Later on, it goes back to mentioning him sans name.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Technically, the sefer doesn't stop using Achav's name, seeing as the division between Melachim 1 and 2 is a later Christian invention. However, the question of course stands for this chapter.</p>\n<p>Da'at Mikra explain that the reason Achav is referred here as \"the King of Israel\" is because the main subject of the chapter is something of national importance to the Kingdom of Israel: The freeing of an Israeli city from enemy hands.</p>\n<p>I'll add that similarly, in chapter 20, Achav is referred to several times as \"the King of Israel\", each time in relation to matters of kingdom-wide importance. Once when he submits to King Ben-Hadad (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.20.3-4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:3-4</a>), once when he seeks counsel from the elders (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.20.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:7</a>), and three times during and after his meeting with the unnamed prophet who tells him he's going to fall as punishment (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.20.40-43?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:40-43</a>).</p>\n<p>Therefore, in a sense, we may say that chapter 22 is echoing chapter 20: Though Achav should be commended for also focusing on matters of national importance, ultimately, for his various sins, he was to be punished. He merited to bravely die in battle <em>because</em> he also cared about his people.</p>\n\n\n",

In Bechorot, it is brought up referring to Bamidbar 3:12, 3:39, 3:45. In Chullin, it is brought up referring to Ezra 3:8. In Tamid, it is brought up referring to Divrei Hayamim Aleph 26:17 (which may have multiple cases).</p>\n<p>Additionally, Torah Temimah proves from Bava Kamma 108b that Devarim 18:6 also refers to Kohanim. Rashi in Sukkah 55b (d.h. uvah) also writes that Devarim 18:7 refers to Kohanim. Sheyarei Korban to Yerushalmi Sotah 8:3 writes that according to the Yerushalmi, Divrei Hayamim Bet 35:3 also refers to Kohanim.</p>\n<p>Thus it is possible to assemble a list of 24 places in which Kohanim are referred to as Leviyim, especially if we consider separate mentions in the same paragraph or section to be multiple cases.</p>\n<p>I have no resolution to explain the Sha'ar Hagilgulim's statement, which is at clear odds with the Gemara and Pesukim. I have no idea how he resolves cases in Yirmiyahu and Yehoshua.</p>\n<p>Edit: I searched Otzar, and found one author (Harei Yehudah Volume 2 page 14) suggest that none are as explicit as Yechezkel, since he mentions Tzadok, who was a Kohen, by name, and refers to him as a Levi, whereas in all other places, it refers to Kohanim/Leviyim in general.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>For some reason everyone seems to be focus on the examples of \"כהנים לוים\" meaning \"כהנים\"; however, I found a number of places where the pasuk literally says just plain (לוי(ם and the meforshim say that it really means (כהנ(ים.

For aside from this being a great mitzvah in itself because of the sanctity of the place, as the holy books write, it is also of great avail to us in other respects 1) that the Torah one studies in the house of study and his prayers be complete, not lacking any answering of \"Amen\" and \"Amen yeheh shmer rabbah\" and \"Barchu\", 2) that through this there be in the accounting of the days of his life about ten years free of forbidden speech. For a Jew is found during the day in the house of study for his prayers and for some time after his prayer, for at least four hours a day, especially if he also has a set time for Torah study every day in the house of study for about two hours. Attending to this, about one-fourth of the full day is spent by him in Torah and prayer. If so, how good it will be for him when a fourth part of the days of his life will be added in which there will not have been any forbidden speech, but only Torah and prayer, 3) that though through this it becomes easier for him every day, too, to guard his faculty of speech, having taught himself every day to suppress it five or six hours all the time that he sat in the house of study.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Yereim is 324 in the old edition, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_Yereim.409.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">409 in the newer edition</a> (printed for the first time after sefer Chofetz Chaim):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למדנו כשאמרה תורה את מקדשי תיראו שבתי כנסיות ובתי מדרשות בכלל</p>\n<p>We have learned that when the Torah says \"fear my sanctuary\" that synagogues and study halls are included.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_Mitzvot_Gadol%2C_Positive_Commandments.164.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Smag positive comandment 164</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וגם בב״כ ובבתי מדרשות צריך מורא וכבוד ואין נוהגין בהן קלות ראש</p>\n<p>Also in synagogues and study halls awe and honor are required, and one does not act in them lightheadedly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_Mitzvot_Katan.6.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Smak 6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לירא מקדש דכתי' (ויקרא י״ט:ל׳) ומקדשי תיראו. ובזמן הזה הוה בית הכנסת מקדש מעט.</p>\n<p>To fear the sanctuary, as is written \"and fear my sanctuary.\" In these times the synagogue is a miniature sanctuary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why seven names for Jethro?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Jethro was called by 7 names in the Tanach.  Rashi summarizes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁבַע שֵׁמוֹת נִקְרְאוּ לוֹ: רְעוּאֵל, יֶתֶר, יִתְרוֹ, חוֹבָב, חֶבֶר, קֵינִי, פּוּטִיאֵל\nHe was called by seven names: Reuel, Jether, Jethro, Chovav, Cheber, Keni and Putiel. [Rashi on Ex. 18:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sources elaborate:</p>\n<p>1-He was called יֶתֶר  Yeter (from יִתֵּר, “to add”) because he caused the addition of a Torah portion, Yitro (Ex. 18:1-20:23) and he was he was “abundant” (yiter) in good deeds.</p>\n<p>2-Jethro, because when he converted to Judaism a letter (vav) was added to his name: יִתְרוֹ.</p>\n<p>3-Chovav חוֹבָב, because he “loved” (חִבֵּב) God and the Torah [Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 18:1:2].</p>\n<p>4-Reuel רְעוּאֵל: Torah says Reuel was Chovav’s father, but sometimes children call their grandfather “father”. [Sifrei Bamidbar 79, on Numbers 10:29]</p>\n<p>5-Keni  קֵינִי  [in Judges 1:16], because he was “zealous”(kinei) for God and “acquired” (kanah) the Torah [Mekhilta Yitro 1].</p>\n<p>6-Chever  חֶבֶר [in Judges 4:11], because he was the “associate” of God.</p>\n<p>7-Putiel פּוּטִיאֵל [in Ex. 6:25], because he had renounced idolatry (niftar). A different interpretation: “he fattened calves” (pittem) for idolatrous sacrifice. [Bava Batra 109b]</p>\n<p>(1) However, Balak, Korach and Sarah have Torah portions named after them and their names were not changed. Also, (3), (5) and (6) are the same general idea.  (2) and (7) are also the same idea.</p>\n<p>Do the Sources discuss why there was a need for this proliferation of names, not emulated elsewhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are several questions and premises packed into this one question, and I don't know if all can be answered in a single answer.</p>\n<p>The overarching question appears to be what Chazal to specifically create this proliferation of names for Yisro, and not for others. Secondary to that is that some of the reasons seem weak, like adding a portion, while Sarah, Balak and Korach \"added a portion\" by getting a parasha named after them (thus perhaps suggesting that they were going out of their way to create additional names). Underlying all of this is a desire for Chazal to be systematic and act with purpose.</p>\n<p>In terms of how unique such a proliferation of names were within the thought of Chazal, <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?mefaresh=raba&book=2&perek=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Rabba on Ki Tisa</a> provides a list of such persons:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראה קראתי בשם\nזה אחד משבעה בני אדם שנקראו להם שמות.\nיש שנקראו לו ארבעה,\nזה אליהו,\nבצלאל ו',\nויהושע ו',\nומשה ז',\nמרדכי ב',\nדניאל ה',\nחנניה מישאל ועזריה ד',\nאליהו ד'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It proceeds to elaborate each of those. But we see that Moshe had seven names (Yalkut Shimoni lists ten), and Yehoshua and Betzalel has six names. While Yisro is not one of the names mentioned, in its elaboration, we see one possible reason for naming these tzadikim by multiple names:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בצלאל, מה שקרא לו אומתו שלו, והקב\"ה קרא לו חמשה שמות של חבה על שם המשכן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the five additional names of Betzalel were names of Chiba, endearment.</p>\n<p>In terms of Yisro, your list is an aggregation of sources (Mechilta, Sifrei, Talmud), and presumes that Chazal were monolithic. However, it is possible that those who gave some of the alternate names did not give (or agree with) the other alternate names. It could, rather, be a case of localized interpretation by different Rabbinic figures, each grappling with a different aspect or difficulty of the text under discussion. And, as DoubleAA mentioned in a comment, the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/122394/759\">Law of Conservation of Biblical Personalities</a> is a common feature of midrash.</p>\n<p>In terms of adding a parasha in the Torah, this is not exactly the same as having a parsha named after you. In the language of Chazal, the weekly portion in Bavel by which one finished the Torah was called a sidra, not a parasha. A parasha is a section, as between the petucha and setuma gaps. Yisro successfully added such a section in the Torah by proposing new laws of a system of judges. Moshe ran the idea by Hashem, who gave his approval, and so there was now a new Divinely ordained section of laws. That is not the same as Sarah who died, and whose burial is discussed at the start of one of the sidrot, Korach who rebelled and had to be dealt with, Balak who hired Bilaam and had to be dealt with, all who had names at the beginning of the sidra. Nor is it the same as Pharaoh who enslaved the Jews and thus \"added\" all the sidrot where the Hebrews were enslaved.</p>\n\n\n",

The Sefer HaRazim, on the other hand, has most of its interest, from what I can tell at least, from New Agers and Hermeticists eager for more ancient wisdom that don't care about the amount of syncretism, scholars of religion, or people fascinated by its antiquity.

And this is consistent throughout the various Church Fathers that tried to explain the trinity. None have been able to explain it satisfactorily, but more importantly, the need to come up with different explanations already in itself shows that it is not purely monotheistic. Christians still struggle to explain it, both to themselves and to others.</p>\n<p>Judaism has a couple of problems with the trinity:</p>\n<p>a. The triune identity of god - this goes against various verses in the Bible that attest to God's oneness, such as: \"And the LORD shall be king over all the earth; in that day there shall be one LORD with one name.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zechariah.14.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zechariah 14:9</a>), \"Hear, O Israel!

The Prozbul dictates that all loans made <em>prior</em> to the writing of the actual Prozbul are to be given to the Beis Din during the Shemitah year, thus allowing the lender to collect them afterward. Therefore, if one pre-dates his Prozbul then it prevents him from being able to collect any other loans that he lent <em>after</em> the writing of the Prozbul, as the Shemita year cancels them.</p>\n<p>For example:\nReuven lent 100 dollars to Shimon 2 months before the coming of the Shemitah year (The month of Tamuz of the 6th year). In order to allow Reuven to collect the loan from Shimon after the Shemita year, we write a Prozbul that states that the loan will be given into the jurisdiction of the Beis Din during the Shemitah year. Now, this Prozbul only dictates that the loan of 100 dollars will be given into the jurisdiction of Beis Din, however any other loans Reuven lends to Shimon afterward, let's say in the last month before the Shemitah year, will not be included in the Prozbul and will become void at the start of the Shemitah Year. It is therefore in the best interest of the lender, in our case Reuven, to delay writing the Prozbul as late as possible. If Reuven decides to pre-date the Prozbul, it is only to his detriment, as he is preventing himself the opportunity to collect any loans he may make after the writing of the Prozbul. It is for this reason, a predated Prozbul is valid (We are always concerned for the borrower and not for the lender).</p>\n<p>If the Prozbul was post-dated it is invalid as it is a detriment to the borrower, for it doesn't allow the loans that were made after the writing of the Prozbul to become void, and thus the lender will collect from the borrower unlawfully. Using our example above, the writing of the Prozbul took place 2 months before the Shemita year. Now, let's say that Reuven lent an additional 50 dollars to Shimon 1 month before the Shemita year, after the writing of the Prozbul. This 50 dollar loan should become void at the start of the Shemita year as it was not included in the Prozbul. However, if Reuven post-dated the Prozbul with the date of the Prozbul being from 1 month before the Shemita year, this allows Reuven to collect the additional loan of 50 dollars, when it actuality this loan was lent afterward, thus unlawfully collecting the 50 dollars, for it was bound to be void at the start of the Shemita year.</p>\n<p>Standard monetary loan documents work in the opposite direction. When this loan document is post-dated, it is to the detriment of the lender and is therefore valid. When the loan document is pre-dated then it is to the detriment of the borrower and therefore rendered invalid.</p>\n<p>For example:\nReuven lent 100 dollars to Shimon on the 15th of Nissan. The loan document should dictate this exact date, so that if the borrower sells property afterward to a third party, let's call him Levi, then Reuven has the right to collect that property from Levi as he was owed that money prior to Levi's purchase. This is essentially what a lien on a property is.</p>\n<p>If the loan document was pre-dated and stated that the loan took place on the 1st of Nissan, this would allow Reuven to collect any property that the borrower sold prior to the 15th, the actual date of the loan, in an unlawful manner, as those sales were outside the realm of the loan. This is why a pre-dated loan document is invalid. (Anecdotal Note: not only is the loan document invalid in that it doesn't allow Reuven to collect property sold by Shimon from <em>before</em> the 15th, it doesn't even allow Reuven to collect from property sold by Shimon <em>after</em> the 15th, this is a consequence that the Beis Din enacts in order to reprimand Reuven for trying to essentially steal from Shimon.)</p>\n<p>If the loan document was post-dated and stated that the loan took place on the 1st of Iyar, this would restrict Reuven from being able to collect any properties sold by Shimon after the 15th, a detriment to himself as the lender. It is for this reason that a postdated loan document is valid.</p>\n\n\n",

Or is it not considered charity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>EBT is not from a person, it’s a taxpayer funded program run by the state. The money does not come from a goy but a government fund, therefore it is not accepting tzeddakah from goyim but the broader public.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The fact that money is coming from the government (public funds) doesn't seem to make it less of a charity.  The Gemora <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.10b.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 10b</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִיפְרָא הוֹרְמִיז אִימֵּיהּ דְּשַׁבּוּר מַלְכָּא שַׁדַּרָה אַרְבַּע מְאָה דִּינָרֵי לְקַמֵּיהּ דְּרַבִּי אַמֵּי וְלָא קַבְּלִינְהוּ שַׁדַּרְ[תִּ]ינְהוּ קַמֵּיהּ דְּרָבָא וְקַבְּלִינְהוּ מִשּׁוּם\nשְׁלוֹם מַלְכוּת שְׁמַע רַבִּי אַמֵּי אִיקְּפַד אֲמַר לֵית לֵיהּ בִּיבֹשׁ קְצִירָהּ תִּשָּׁבַרְנָה נָשִׁים בָּאוֹת מְאִירוֹת אוֹתָהּ וְרָבָא מִשּׁוּם שְׁלוֹם מַלְכוּת</p>\n<p>Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur sent four hundred dinars to Rabbi Ami, but he did not accept them. She then sent them to Rava, and he accepted them for the sake of peace with the government . Rabbi Ami heard what Rava had done and was upset. He said:  the The posuk : “When the boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come and set them on fire” (So why) did Rava accept the money? (The Gemara answers:) He did so for the sake of peace with the kingdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemora goes on to say that even Rava who accepted the money for the sake of Shalom Malchhus gave it to non-Jewish recipients.</p>\n<p>It is safe to assume that Ifera Hurmiz was sending public money. Not money she privately  earned on her own.</p>\n<p>On another note I know people  on government programs who would not accept Edus  by a Chasuna and I know people who would not give it to them because it so difficult to be 100% straight with the  government that they feel anyone on programs is not kosher for edus due to psul gazlan</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the following Trinitarian conceptual understanding of the deity polytheistic according to Jewish theology?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/122468/why-is-the-trinity-considered-polytheistic-in-traditional-jewish-thought/122472#122472\">previous question</a> on this topic was closed because it required knowledge of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.  To avoid that problem, I am proposing a particular formal definition of the doctrine formulated by Aquinas, and asking whether this formal definition is considered polytheism by Jewish thought.</p>\n<p>Basically, he says that there are intelligible relationships within the concept of the deity, which he seems to consider a necessary truth derived from scripture.  He gives <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1028.htm#article1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the example of the deity's word</a>, such as speaking the world into existence in Genesis, and the word must be identical with the deity to preserve divine simplicity.  Yet at the same time, there must be a relationship between the word and from whence it proceeds.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1028.htm#article2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">these relationships cannot be other than the essence of the deity</a>, otherwise that would violate the deity's necessary property of being fundamentally simple in its essence.  In other words, these relationships cannot in someway stand outside the deity, or be 'parts' of which the deity is composed.</p>\n<p>So, is there anything in this bare logical argument that necessitates polytheism?  I'll grant the premise about the deity speaking a word is controversial, but if all the premises were considered correct by Jewish thinkers, would they still somehow be forced to conclude Aquinas' idea still necessitated polytheism?</p>\n<p>============</p>\n<p>I apologize this question comes across as awkwardly phrased.  I am trying to avoid a couple problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Site members having to know another religion's doctrine (Christian doctrine of the Trinity) to answer the question.  To avoid this I am stating a specific formulation that is free from knowing anything about Christianity, stated in as plain a language as I can.</li>\n<li>Strawman arguments.  The majority of Christians believe the Trinity is a single deity, and the Jewish arguments against the Trinity I have seen seem to be against a strawman version, which is certainly believed by some Christians, but I am interested in what the Jewish argument is against the best formulation of the Trinitarian doctrine as consistent with monotheism.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully, my attempt is successful and doesn't get shut down again.  I am genuinely curious, since the doctrine of the Trinity is the main reason why Christianity is considered idolatrous due to polytheism, yet from what I have seen this appears to be an unfortunate misunderstanding, as Aquinas appears to have successfully demonstrated the doctrine of the Trinity is consistent with maximally strong monotheism.</p>\n<p>=============</p>\n<p>Finally, as a side note, I've <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">noticed</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/121675/1762\">other</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8920/why-isnt-the-kabbalistic-doctrine-of-sefirot-considered-shittuf-if-the-christia\">q&as</a> on this site drawing comparison between the Trinity and Sefirot.  This is a tangent, but the point is to demonstrate that when we boil things down to their logical essence, abstracting away the religious connotations, it looks like Aquinas actually is saying the same thing as the Sefirot.

Do three great human bodies constitute the Divinity?' 'No!' 'Or are there three ethereal bodies, such as the souls, or are there three angels?' 'No!' 'Or is an object composed of three kinds of matter, as bodies are composed of the four elements?' 'No!' 'What then is the Trinity?'</p>\n<p>He said: 'Wisdom, will, and power' [comp. the definition of Thomas Aquinas cited above].</p>\n<p>Then I said: 'I also acknowledge that God is wise and not foolish, that He has a will unchangeable, and that He is mighty and not weak. But the term \"Trinity\" is decidedly erroneous; for wisdom is not accidental in the Creator, since He and His wisdom are one, He and His will are one, He and His power are one, so that wisdom, will, and power are one. Moreover, even were these things accidental in Him, that which is called God would not be three beings, but one being with these three accidental attributes.'</p>\n<p>Our lord <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Aragon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the king</a> here quoted an analogy which the erring ones [the Christians] had taught him, saying that there are also three things in wine, namely, color, taste, and bouquet, yet it is still one thing.</p>\n<p>This is a decided error; for the redness, the taste, and the bouquet of the wine are distinct essences, each of them potentially self-existent; for there are red, white, and other colors, and the same statement holds true with regard to taste and bouquet. The redness, the taste, and the bouquet, moreover, are not the wine itself, but the thing which fills the vessel, and which is, therefore, a body with the three accidents. Following this course of argument, there would be four, since the enumeration should include God, His wisdom, His will, and His power, and these are four. You would even have to speak of five things; for He lives, and His life is a part of Him just as much as His wisdom. Thus the definition of God would be 'living, wise, endowed with will, and mighty'; the Divinity would therefore be fivefold in nature. All this, however, is an evident error.</p>\n<p>Then Fra Pablo arose and said that he believed in the unity, which, none the less, included the Trinity, although this was an exceedingly deep mystery, which even the angels and the princes of heaven could not comprehend. I arose and said: 'It is evident that a person does not believe what he does not know: therefore the angels do not believe in the Trinity.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This must have been a winning blow, because Nachmanides then recorded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"His [Pablo Christiani's] colleagues then bade him [Pablo] be silent.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>So apparently Aquinas was born in 1225, well after the main works usually quoted to explain the Jewish viewpoint were written. As they lay it out (Chovos HaLevavos and Rambam in the beginning of Mishna Torah), the very concept of divisibility or G-d having discrete parts is logically impossible. This concept is referred to as Achdus Hashem, or the Oneness of G-d. Thus Rambam explains that while G-d has intelligence, it is not separate or a characteristic as with humans, but part of the nature of his essence. So G-d is still one. That is, his intelligence is not in any way distinct from whatever G-d is.</p>\n<p>The Chovos HaLevavos is very clear that when we refer to G-d as one, what we really mean is that he is missing any multiplicity. We cannot know what G-d is, only what he is not, and he is not multiple in any way.</p>\n<p>Thus, any verses that seem to refer to G-d having parts are not meant to be understood literally. Verses that say G-d has limbs, emotions, etc. are all metaphorical, because it is a)against our tradition, and b)illogical for G-d to contain any parts or divisibility.</p>\n<p>These arguments would seem to leave no room for any kind of Trinity. As the Chovos HaLevavos says, the concept of the unity of G-d leaves no place for multiplicity of any kind. (While the term unity <em>in other contexts</em> can include multiplicity, it cannot here.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The distinction between true (absolute) unity and conventional unity is as follows.<br />\n2The term \"one\" is derived from the concept of \"unity\". The term is used in two senses. One of them is mikri (incidental), which is the conventional unity. While the second is in essence and enduring - this is true (absolute) unity.<br />\n3Incidental unity subdivides into two divisions. In one of these the character of multitude, collectivity, and aggregation is apparent in it, such as one genus which includes many species or like one species which includes many individuals, and like one man which is comprised of many parts or one army which includes many men.<br />\n4Or like we say one Hin (measure), one Rova (measure) or one liter (ex. of rice or water) which contain smaller measures, each of which is also called \"one\". Every one of these things we mentioned are called \"one\" conventionally, because the things included under the one name are alike. Every one of them may also be called \"plural\" since it includes many things which when separated and isolated will each be called \"one\". Unity in all these manners we mentioned is Mikre (incidental). Each is a unit from one perspective and plural from another aspect.<br />\n5The second division of incidental unity is the unity attributed to a single individual, who though seemingly not plural and not a collection of several things, yet is essentially plural, - being composed of matter and form, essence and incident, susceptible to \"creation\" and \"destruction\", division and combination, separation and association, change and variation. (see commentaries)<br />\n6Plurality must be attributed to anything for which any of these things we mentioned applies to, for they are contradictory to unity. Unity ascribed to anything essentially plural and variable in any way is undoubtedly Mikre (an incidental property). It is unity conventionally, but not in a true sense. Strive to understand this.<br />\n7True (absolute) unity is also of two kinds. The first in abstract thought and the second in actual reality.<br />\n8The abstract thought version is numerical unity, namely, the root and beginning of all numbers. It is the sign and symbol of a beginning unprecedented by any other beginning. For every true beginning is termed \"One\", as for example: \"And there was evening and there was morning, one day\" (Gen. 1:5). Instead of saying \"the first day\", the verse uses the term \"one (day)\", because the term \"one\" refers to any beginning unprecedented by any other beginning. When repeated, it is called \"the second\", and when repeated again - \"the third\", and so on until the number \"ten\", \"a hundred\", \"a thousand\", which are also units of new series, and so on to infinity.<br />\n9Therefore the definition of number is that it is a sum of units. The reason I called it \"abstract thought\" is because the notion of number is not perceived by the physical senses. Rather, it is grasped only in thought. It is the \"numbered\" object alone which is perceptible to the five senses or by some of them.<br />\n10The second kind of true unity exists actually. It is that which is neither plural nor susceptible to change or variation, is not described by any of the corporeal attributes, is not subject to \"creation\", destruction or end. Does not move or waver, does not resemble anything nor does anything resemble it, and is not associated with anything. It is from all possible perspectives - true Unity and the root of everything plural. For as we already pointed out, unity is the cause of plurality.<br />\n11The true unity has neither beginning nor finiteness because anything which has a beginning or finiteness necessarily must be subject to origination and destruction. And anything subject to these is also subject to change, and change is inconsistent with Unity. Hence, it would be more than one since it had existed as one thing and then changed into a different thing, and this necessarily implies plurality.<br />\n12Similarity is also an incidental property (mikre) in anything which is similar (to something else), and whatever has an incidental property is plural. But absolute unity, in its glorious essence, is not subject to any incidental properties whatsoever in any respect.<br />\n13<strong>If one will claim that the quality of \"unity\" is itself an incidental property in the Absolutely One.\n14We will answer this as follows: The ascribing of true unity is intended to express the exclusion of multitude and plurality. When we describe Him as One, we mean only the negation of any multitude or plurality. But the true Unity, cannot be described by any attribute that would connote in His glorious essence any plurality, change, or variation. With this we have completed our words, regarding the true unity and the relative unity. Note it well.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In your characterization of Aquinas, he seems to be going for a paradox: G-d is one and indivisible, while also being three. The impossibility of this making sense is also described in the Chovos HaLevavos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fourth argument: We will say to anyone who thinks the Creator is more than one as follows. <strong>It must be that the essence of all these (supposed creators) is either one or not one.</strong><br />\n25If you say, that in essence they are one, if so, they are one thing, and the Creator is not more than one.<br />\n26If you say that each one of them is, in essence, different from the other, <strong>it must therefore be there is some distinction between them due to their difference and non-similarity.</strong> If so, whatever is distinct is limited/bound. And whatever is limited/bound is finite. And whatever is finite is composite - and whatever is composite was brought into existence, and whatever is brought into existence must have a Creator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, in order to say there is a trinity, there must be some way of distinguishing the three entities. At that point they are no longer the true oneness of G-d.</p>\n<p>And while they are aware there are verses that indicate against this understanding of G-d, they are not greater challenges to it than the many verses that describe \"eyes\" or \"hands\" or other body parts to G-d. The solution is to say they are metaphorical, not that G-d's parts are part of a greater unity. As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.49a.11?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who translates a verse literally is a liar, since he distorts the meaning of the text, and conversely, one who adds his own translation is tantamount to one who curses and blasphemes God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So implicitly, when faced with verses that create greater challenges than the one posed by Aquinas, they rejected his answer as heretical, and insisted that it would be erroneous to follow the literal meaning of the verses.</p>\n<p>In addition, if Aquinas believed that the historical Jesus was part of the Trinity, all of this is unnecessary. No amount of rhetorical handwaving can make considering a flesh-and-blood person divine anything other than idolatry.</p>\n\n\n",

In all but one of those occurrences, the context provides no clue as to the sexual status of the young woman or women. <strong>Virginity is suggested, however, in Song of Solomon 6:8,</strong> where almah occurs in the plural (rnthp, alcunot): \"There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins (-nthy, alamot) without number.\"</p>\n<p>He wrote in \"I Dare You Not to Bore Me with the Bible\":</p>\n<p><em>The distinction between queens, concubines, and alamot is important.

This would suggest that the third group, the alamot, had no sexual relationship with the king. An almah in this text is a candidate to become a concubine or a wife. This is precisely what we see in the book of Esther. In Esther 2:3 and 2:8 we read that Esther was held in waiting for 12 months with \"young virgins\"(na'arah betulah) under the supervision of Hegai while the king sought a new queen. The use of na'ar and betulah indicates that a \"young woman\" (na'ar) could certainly be a \"virgin\" (betulah). Esther was eventually taken from the \"young virgins\" under Hegai to the king for an evening liaison. Afterward, she was  Afterward, she was assigned to a \"second harem\" supervised by Shaashgaz, who \"was in charge of the concubines\" (Esth 2:14)—indicating that Esther was no longer a virgin, but now a concubine. That Esther and the king had a sexual\nrelationship during the night is clear from Esther 2:14: \"She Esther would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.\" To \"go in\" to a man or woman is a common Old Testament euphemism for sexual intercourse (e.g., Gen 16:2; 29:21; 38:8; Dent 21:13; 25:5; Judg 15:1). The Esther story describes the king's harem as divided into three groups: queen, concubines and young virgins. The last of those groups is described as naarah betulah, \"young virgins.\" In parallel, Song of Songs 6:8 has the same threefold division, but uses almah (plural: alamot) to describe the third group. This indicates that (naarah betulah) and (alamot) are likely both descriptions of \"virgins.\" Nonetheless, since Esther is never called an almah, could almah still be excluded from the Old Testament vocabulary for \"virgin\"?\nFor the assertion that \"almah cannot mean virgin\" to be correct, naarah and betulah must never overlap with almah. But they do.\nIn Genesis 24, Rebekah is referred to with all three terms (naarah in 24:14, betulah in 24:16, and almah in 24:43), indicating that the terms could certainly be construed as synonymous.</em></p>\n<p>The question is: Is it true what he argued, that alamot in Song of Solomon 6:8 were necessarily virgins, and if not why not?</p>\n<p>If his argument is true and bethula means alone virgin, then why is בְּתוּל֖וֹת not used instead of וַעֲלָמ֖וֹת?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even if you accept his reasoning at face value, that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The distinction between queens, concubines, and alamot is important.

In fact, a virgin would be less likely to engage in or offer casual sex (even with a King) than a non-virgin.</p>\n<p>The point is not that almah can <em>never</em> mean a virgin, just that it specifically means a young woman, with no reference to her virginity or lack thereof. So in the case of the verse referring to an almah giving birth, it would be highly illogical to assume the almah in question is a virgin with no other basis than the use of the word almah. It definitely cannot be used to support the Christian faith in any way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<h2>The use of <em>עלמה</em> is specifically meant to <strong>not</strong> be a בתולה because the comparison to queen and concubine is a woman who may (or may not) have had sexual relations without being married. Shir Hashirim is deliberately set up for allegory and not literal meaning at all. Thus the literal meaning of almah is a young woman who is not attached to a man as the alternative to a queen or a concubine. That is why the allegory as explained below is given. If the term besulah had been given, the fourth alternative (an almah but not a besulah) would have to have been associated as well.</h2>\n<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong></p>\n<p>It does not necessarily refer to virgins. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16450/showrashi/true#v8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir Hashirim 6:8</a> as we see in Rashi, the three groups refer to the inhabitants of the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>8 There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and innumerable\nmaidens.</p>\n<p><strong>There are sixty queens:</strong> Abraham and his descendants (Song Zuta).

This \"idea\" falls under the category of \"things Non-Jews think that Jews believe.\" One reason this idea keeps being falsely attributed to us because Judaism is a religion, culture, and ethnicity and so it's harder for other religions to conceptualize. Another reason is because Jews don't view every verse in the Bible as applying to \"everyone.\" Jews view that most commandments are specifically commanded to the Jews and not necessarily to anyone else. In much the same way I give rules and expectations to my kids that I don't expect from other kids. But does that mean if I ever adopted a child I wouldn't treat them the same as my own children?? Or that I view other children as less holy or worthwhile than my children?? God forbid!</p>\n<p>I use this example to explain that God has specific expectations and rules for His firstborn children the Jews, but anyone who converts also becomes a Jew and is accepted into this special relationship with God.</p>\n<p>Grace Asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Jews do believe that he did call non-Jews to one God, how did they come to the belief that one can only be Jewish through some kind of blood heritage?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, Jews don't believe that blood is required to be Jewish. And Jews don't believe that Moses or God excludes non Jews. These ideas fall under the category of \"things non-Jews think Jews believe,\" and are easily disproven.</p>\n<p>The first and biggest example to show that Moses was sent specifically to the children of Israel as their savior and redeemer BUT not excluding anyone else who wanted to join can be found in Exodus 12:37. When the Israelites are getting ready to leave Egypt we hear of the mixed multitudes who join them. These mixed multitudes are a mix of other non-Israelite people who were living in Egypt when all the plagues and miracles were happening.</p>\n<p><strong>Exodus 12:37-39</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>37 Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six\nhundred thousand men on foot, aside from children. A <em><strong>mixed\nmultitude</strong> also went up with them</em>, along with flocks and herds, a\nvery large number of livestock. And they baked the dough which they\nhad brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread.

    "content": "# Is ethics a reason behind commandments?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One reason frequently advanced for shechitah is that it minimizes pain to the animal being slaughtered.  But Gentiles have no such restrictions (shechitah is not a Noahide law) and fish do not require shechitah.  Doesn't that invalidate that particular reason?</p>\n<p>More generally, one possible way to assess whether ethical reasons are behind a commandment is whether the commandment applies to non-Jews also.  For example, the Torah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may give [carrion] to the stranger who is in your cities, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. [Deut. 14:21]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, is God saying He doesn't care whether Gentiles live or die?  Surely not.

(Presumably, if you satisfy yourself that you know the reason, you will be even more inclined to follow a commandment.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In this answer, I'll first establish that this assumption about the operating principle of <em>darshinan taama dekra</em> doesn't fit with the sources, and then offer three possible resolutions to the difficulty.</p>\n<p>There is a big Talmudic dispute whether we interpret the reasons behind commandments, with Rabbi Shimon famously endorsing the position. However, even those who say we don't so interpret often discuss reasons for commandments, and it is meritorious to do so. The core difference is whether the interpreted reason can be used to qualify and restrict the application of the law. For instance, if the purpose of prohibiting taking the garment of a widow as a pledge (because otherwise, you need to return it at night because she will have nothing in which to sleep, and we don't want this to occur for other reasons), this should not apply to a rich widow. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.21a\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 21a</a> for this example.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דתניא אלמנה בין שהיא ענייה בין שהיא עשירה אין ממשכנין אותה שנאמר (דברים כד, יז) לא תחבול בגד אלמנה דברי רבי יהודה רבי שמעון אומר עשירה ממשכנין אותה ענייה אין ממשכנין אותה ואתה חייב להחזיר לה ואתה משיאה שם רע בשכנותיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As it is taught in a baraita (Tosefta, Bava Metzia 10:3): In the case of a widow, whether she is poor or whether she is wealthy, one may not take collateral from her for a loan, as it is stated: “You may not take the garment of a widow for a pledge” (Deuteronomy 24:17); this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: In the case of a wealthy widow, one may take collateral from her. But in the case of a poor widow, one may not take collateral from her, because you are obligated to return it to her, and you will give her a bad name among her neighbors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>To put your assumption to the test, according to Rabbi Shimon, how could he say that the ethical consideration of this poor widow be the concern? After all, this religious obligation does not apply to gentiles! If God wanted to protect widows, it would have applied to Jewish lenders and borrowers, and gentile lenders and borrowers alike! Yet, Rabbi Shimon still says what he says. This is, in my view, a proof by contradiction that the assumption underlying your question is somehow false. (Why it would be false is a separate question, but the proof by contradiction takes statements by Rabbi Shimon, the main proponent of darshinan taama dikra, as axiomatic, so any argument which then undermines these statements must be false. You can of course feel free to question Rabbi Shimon as well, and not take it as axiomatic. You could also argue that this reason regarding the poor widow is not ethically guided, but I don't see that as convincing.)</p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>As to why ethically-guided commandments would only apply to Jews and not gentiles, I can offer a few suggestions.</p>\n<p>a. It could be that while God desires the result, He is not imposing it as a requirement upon all people, only those who opt in to the more difficult level of obligations. There are different and good ways of living one's life, and righteous gentiles fulfill one level, and imposing all sorts of ritual obligations on gentiles is not what God intended, just that they broadly live ethical lives.</p>\n<p>b. The point is process rather than result. If indeed the purpose of shechita is that it is less painful (though I don't necessarily endorse this as the reason), God wants the Jewish nation to develop their trait of compassion, and slaughtering animals in this more compassionate manner helps develop that trait.</p>\n<p>c. There are several reasons for the commandment, and we might say that minimizing pain is one of the reasons. See Ein Ayah (to TB Shabbos 23b, §26) by Rav Kook, that there may be multiple reasons for the commandment. (In shiur, I heard this idea developed, that we may not know all the reasons for a commandment, which is why we don't rule like Rabbi Shimon to use this to limit the application of the law. After all, perhaps a different reason applies, and we don't even know all of the reasons.)</p>\n<p>Taking this idea and running with it, it could be that the ethical component is the reason for the particulars of the mitzvah. In other words, requiring that Jews slaughter their animals in a prescribed manner has several effects, such as distinguishing their diets from the diets of the neighboring nations (so that they won't intermarry). Why did God choose this specific way of changing the diet? Because it is also more ethical, and reduces the pain of the animal. Or, for another reason, it enhances health - not that it will <em>kill</em> the stranger or foreigner, but it will reward those who follow His commandments and promote His ethics, by giving them fewer health problems. That does not mean that He will impose upon the gentiles that they may not eat this food because it is less healthy. And it is one of several reasons which sum up to a commandment imposed upon Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:28 Rambam writes the following about reasons for commandments in general:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will show that all these and similar laws must have some bearing upon one of the following three things, viz., the regulation of our opinions, or the improvement of our social relations, which implies two things, the removal of injustice, and the teaching of good morals.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp164.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the specific examples you mention, in both instances Rambam states that the reason is that which you attempt to reject. In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:48 he writes regarding kosher foods:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I maintain that the food which is forbidden by the Law is unwholesome. There is nothing among the forbidden kinds of food whose injurious character is doubted, except pork (Lev. xi. 7), and fat (ibid. vii. 23). But also in these cases the doubt is not justified. For pork contains more moisture than necessary [for human food], and too much of superfluous matter. The principal reason why the Law forbids swine's flesh is to be found in the circumstance that its habits and its food are very dirty and loathsome. It has already been pointed out how emphatically the Law enjoins the removal of the sight of loathsome objects, even in the field and in the camp; how much more objectionable is such a sight in towns. But if it were allowed to eat swine's flesh, the streets and houses would be more dirty than any cesspool, as may be seen at present in the country of the Franks. A saying of our Sages declares: \"The mouth of a swine is as dirty as dung itself\" (B. T.

    "title": "Unusually high ratio of Levites to Firstborn-Levites",
    "content": "# Unusually high ratio of Levites to Firstborn-Levites\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Near the beginning of the Book of Numbers (from roughly <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.39?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:39</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.51?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:51</a>), G-d commands that all the firstborn Israelite males need to be redeemed via a 1:1 'trade' with a Levite. There were 22,000 eligible Levites, with the remaining 273 Israelite firstborns redeeming themselves via a monetary payment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.39?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.3.39.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> on verse 3:39 questions why weren't there enough Levites, when the counts from the individual Levite families totaled 22,300 Levites. He answers (based on a Gemara in Bechoros) that there were 300 Levites who themselves were firstborn, and therefore inelligible to partake in the redemption of the Israelite firstborn, since they were 'redeeming themselves'.</p>\n<p>While the narrative is straightforward, what strikes me as interesting is the ratio between firstborn Levites and 'standard' Levites. With 22,300 Levites and 300 of them being firstborn, that comes out to less than 1 in 70 Levites being a firstborn. That seems like an unusually low number of firstborns to me (or on the flip side, an unusually high number of non-firstborns)! Do any of the commentators address this seemingly unusual ratio?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A few side points based on comments and other thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While we are dealing only with male firstborn, assuming a relatively equal percent of male and female children, even if the numbers double the ratio should remain the same.</li>\n<li>The total number of non-Levite males comes out to a bit over 600k, per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.1.45?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 1:45-46</a>. That gives the ratio for non-Levites to be around 1 in  28. Much less than 1 in 70. It is worth noting that the total counts are only those aged 20 and older, while the firstborn count began at 1 month (per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.43?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 3:43</a>). However, even if you double the number of non-Levite non-firstborns (which seems generous, IMO, should probably be ~50% more at most), you would still have a lower ratio than the Levites (a difference of about 20 in the denominator).</li>\n<li>There is a Midrash (quoted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.1.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.1.7.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Exodus 1:7</a>) that Jewish women were regularly birthing sextuplets. That may account for an unusually high ratio, although the Levite ratio being higher would not be explained by this alone. It is also worth noting that some opinions say that the Levites were not included in this blessing, since it was a 'compensation' for being enslaved in Egypt and the Levites were not included in the subjugation (the ArtScroll Stone Chumash brings this down according to Rashi). According to this opinion, it would strengthen the question, as the Levite ratio should be significantly lower than than the non-Levite ratio.</li>\n<li>It is unclear what Halachic parameters were used here to determine 'Firstborn'. Obviously, standard Pidyon Haben rules weren't followed exactly, as by definition that would preclude Levites from being involved at all. Perhaps there was some unique combination of Halachos and familial makeup here that contributed to the ratio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I am unaware of any classical commentators who address this question. However, I know of 3 different approaches that have emerged in recent years:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Some cite the midrash about each birth in Mitzrayim being sextuplets. That would mean the average family would be six times larger than normal. (I'm not sure if this fully answers the question, but it certainly is a step in the right direction.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Others, including Prof. Eliyahu Beller of Bar Ilan, answer that these are only the firstborns who were born after Makas Bechorot. Notably, the Ramban mentions this idea and rejects it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Prof. Joshua Berman, also from Bar Ilan, in his book \"Ani Maamin\", argues that the census numbers in the Torah are not intended as literal, and brings the number of firstborns, along with several other internal pieces of evidence, as proof.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question is really even stronger. Besides the Levites, the general population had 603,500 from ages 20 to 60 with only 22,270 firstborn sons and that was counting from the age of 30 days! Assuming that every 20 years is 300,000 male adults (obviously later generations would be more but at a minimum it would be 300,000) that means the ratio for the general population is approx. 1:40 which is baffling in of itself. Moreover, any answer to these questions need to take into account the difference between Levites and the rest of the population. Why would Levites have bigger families?</p>\n<p>One idea that can possibly help clarify is the killing of the boys during the exile by Pharoh. Perhaps many firstborns were killed then, only boys not girls. Additionaly, the Levites did not work in Egypt while the rest of the Israelites did, which may have contributed to their larger family sizes. Including the idea of sextuplets may also help however many of those children should of been over 60 by now as that was around the time of the birth of Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Genesis 46:8 \"And these are the names of the children of Israel who\nwere coming to Egypt: Jacob and his sons Jacob's firstborn was\nReuben.\"<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8241/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Israel had 12 sons (from 4 different women) and yet only 1 of these sons were considered \"firstborn\". So, if a Levite had four wives, and if that wife that bore the firstborn had more sons, and the other wives also had scores of sons, then it is indeed possible to have \"an unusually low number of firstborns\" as the OP surmises.</p>\n\n\n",

The issue is complicated by the fact that there <em>are</em> texts scholars doubt the Rambam wrote, including a work that incorporates this letter. As Joshua Prawer writes in his work <em>The History of the Jews in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The text was found at the beginning of a Commentary on Tractate Rosh ha-Shanah wrongly assigned\nto Maimonides, but <strong>there is no reason to doubt the veracity and authenticity</strong> of the biographical note. It\nwas copied by one R. Samuel b. Abraham Secal in Acre. The copyist is probably a man from a well-known\nwealthy family in Narbonne in the last quarter of the 13th cent. (p. 142 note 37)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Jewish scholar David Kraemer writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the letter is quoted in a commentary erroneously attributed to him, <strong>it is accepted as genuine by scholars</strong>. (<em>Jerusalem, 1000–1400: Every People Under Heaven</em>, p. 302, n. 2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to see what the Secal copy of Rambam's letter looked like, here are the pages of the manuscript, archived in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (Manuscript 336):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i5ziU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/i5ziU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Dxl7v.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Dxl7v.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/l0q95.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/l0q95.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>As chortkov2 mentioned in a note, the letter was also replicated in <em>Sefer Haredim</em>. In terms of modern rabbinic scholars, Rav Yitzhak Sheilat, who edited a critical edition of the Rambam's letters (Ma'aleh Adumim), similarly affirmed its reliability by consulting other copies of the letter. After quoting the last part of the text, that it was copied from the Nagid R. David [the Rambam's great-grandson] in Akko, R. Sheilat writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה כי בעיקרה אמיתית היא , אך נתקצרה מלשונו המקורית של ר' דוד , ואף נפלו בה שיבושים\nסביר , איפוא , להניח שעדות כ\"י פריס נכונה , והיה בידי ר' דוד בעכו פירוש ראש השנה , וכן<br />\nהרשימה האוטוביוגרפית , בכתב ידו של הרמב\"ם</p>\n<p>It appears that this is <strong>essentially genuine</strong>, but was abridged from the original language of R. David, with some corruptions that entered. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that the testimony of <strong>the Paris manuscript is correct</strong>, and it was from the hand of R. David in Akko in the commentary on Rosh Hashanah, so that the  autobiographical section was by the Rambam (p. 224-225)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether or not the Rambam ascended to the Temple Mount depends on how you read his words of entering \"the great holy house\" in Jerusalem. Thus, it's not about the letter's authenticity as much as it is a question of whether the Rambam would go against his own writings on the subject (an issue that requires its own question). This is why scholars like Joel L. Kraemer, who agrees he visited Jerusalem, doesn't think he went up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was difficult for Jews and Muslims, though not impossible, to get access to the Temple Mount. <strong>Maimonides would most likely have prayed outside it at the Western Wall</strong>. At the time, the Church of St. Giles was located nearby. No matter where he looked, he would have seen one or more of the many churches established by the Crusaders in Jerusalem. Jews also prayed on the Mount of Olives, facing the Golden Gate.</p>\n<p>The Crusader historian Joshua Prawer understood Maimonides’\nstatement—“I entered the great and holy house and prayed in it”—to\nmean that he entered the Temple Mount and even the Dome of the Rock.\nBut there is no mention of the Dome of the Rock, and it is doubtful\nthat he would have described it as “the great and holy house.” Prawer\nfinds that this raises numerous questions. For example, Maimonides\nruled against Jews entering the holy precinct because of their ritual\nimpurity. The sites that had a special importance were the Mount of\nOlives and the area surrounding the Temple Mount, including segments\nof walls and specific gates. Maimonides’ opinion was rejected by Rabbi\nAbraham ben David in his comment on the ruling, and the halakhic\ndiscussion continues to our own day. (<em>Maimondes: The Life and World of One of Civilization's Greatest Minds</em> , p. 137-138 )</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Kiddushin prior to the ceremony may be but that is arguably a separate process.</p>\n<p><strong>Procreation is a commandment - (Peru Urvu) - but procreation cannot occur without a marriage.</strong> Technically, you're not required to marry but if you're suppose to have a family then it comes with the package.</p>\n<p>You're discussing more the issues of finding the best partner to spend your life with vs the fantasy in your head.</p>\n<p>We all deal with this. The issue relates partially to modern society and the constant need to \"upgrade\" or \"hold out\" for the better option.</p>\n<p>You're never going to find the \"perfect\" match because that isn't how marriage works.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3716712/jewish/Practical-Tips-for-Choosing-a-Soul-Mate.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Chabad has an article which discusses this:</strong></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Too many people remain single simply because they are waiting to meet\nMr. or Ms. Perfect. While certain qualities must remain non-negotiable\n– such as the ones mentioned above – one should be willing to\ncompromise concerning other non-essential preferences. Some examples\nof \"negotiable\" qualities are: appearances, career choices, political\nviews, and nationality.</p>\n<p>In simple words, one should not rule out dating certain people simply\nbecause they have a certain physical build, hair or eye color, or\nprofession. Oftentimes people are surprised to find that they can be\nintensely attracted to, and deeply love, someone who doesn't exactly\nfit their original vision of a perfect spouse.</p>\n<p>When looking to purchase a home, the most important factor to be taken\nin consideration is its structural soundness. After ascertaining that\nthe house will not collapse as a result of a shaky foundation or\nshoddy construction, then the décor and layout are considered. And\nunless building from scratch – an option which is not yet available\nwith regards to a spouse – no one ever finds a home which exactly\nmatches their stylistic wish list.</p>\n<p>No one is perfect. A person who meets all the major criteria and most\nof your minor preferences is someone you should seriously consider.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead of circumventing marriage and circumventing relationships, I think you need to take some time to really try and nail down what it is you want and need in a relationship. You seem conflicted and it seems that some part of the problem is a need to hold out for the fantasy in your mind while ignoring real and genuine people in front of you.</p>\n<p>You can't do that. It's not a functional way to go about this and you'll end up old and alone while waiting for the person in your head to materialize.</p>\n<p>You're not alone in this but you may end up alone if you stick to this.</p>\n\n\n",

הוא \"אַב הֲמוֹן גּוֹיִם\" (בר' יז:ד) ומטרתו\nלקרב את העולם כולו לאמונה בא-ל אחד.<sup>[6]</sup> בנין האומה הישראלית\nמתחיל מיעקב, כדברי חז\"ל על הפסוק \"אֶל־בֵּית אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב\" (יש' ב:ג):\n\"לא כאברהם שכתוב בו הר, ולא כיצחק שכתוב בו שדה, אלא כיעקב שקראו\nבית\".<sup>[7]</sup> הר פתוח לכולם אבל בית מיוחד למשפחה הדרה בו.</p>\n<p>אברהם בהיותו \"אב המון גוים\" הוא השורש האמוני של כל האומות: \"ויקרא שם\nבשם ה' אל עולם\" (בר' כא:לג), והוא גם שורש שלנו. אבל הבנין הפרטיקולרי\nשל האומה מתחיל באופן מעשי ביעקב, אם כי נרמז כבר ביצחק: \"כִּי בְיִצְחָק\nיִקָּרֵא לְךָ זָרַע\" (בר' כא:יב). יש כאן חמש מדרגות בבניין האומה: אברהם\n– האלמנט האוניברסאלי, יצחק – תחילת בנין האומה, יעקב – בונה האומה\nבפועל, יוסף – המאבק לאורך הגלות, ויהודה – המלכות והתיקון הסופי. יצחק\nהוא הנקודה הקודמת לראשית הופעת האומה. יעקב (ישראל) הוא עיקר הבית,\nואילו יוסף הוא זה שנאבק על מקומו של ישראל מול האומות. על כך יש רמז\nיפה. שם הוי\"ה, שהוא השם המפורש, מספרו בגימטריה 26. יצחק = 208 = 26 X\n8. יעקב = 182 = 26 X 7 ואילו יוסף = 156 = 26 X 6. יש כאן שלוש הופעות שונות של שם השם. הראשון הוא יצחק. ידוע מכתבי המהר\"ל מפראג שמספר שבע\nבתנ\"ך מסמל את הטבע, ומספר שמונה מסמל דבר שהוא מעל לטבע (כמו ברית מילה\nשמצוותה ביום השמיני שהוא שינוי בטבע. היא מסמלת את הברית עם הא-ל וגם את\nכל יתר 612 מצוות אשר יחד עמה בגימטריה -ברי\"ת). יצחק היה הראשון שנימול\nביום שמיני. לאחר העקידה הוא נשאר \"עולה תמימה\", מנותק מהעולם הזה, ועל\nכן היה צורך בעבד אברהם שיביא לו את אשתו. יצחק כמעט ואינו מדבר בספר\nבראשית. הוא כמעט ואינו יוזם דבר חדש; הוא חופר את אותן הבארות שחפר\nאברהם אביו וסתמום פלישתים, וקורא לאשתו בעת צרה \"אחותו\", כפי שעשה אביו.\nיעקב, המסומל במספר שבע, מבטא את ההופעה של שם ה' בטבע הכולל גם ימי חול\nוגם שבתות. על כן הוא נאבק עם לבן אבל יחד עם זאת הוא זוכה לברכות ארציות\nושמימיות יחדיו, ככתוב: \"הַקֹּל קוֹל יַעֲקֹב וְהַיָּדַיִם יְדֵי עֵשָׂו\"\n(בר' כז:כב).</p>\n<p>כל ענייני יעקב רומזים למספר שבע שהוא שלמות הטבע: הוא קיבל את כל שבע\nהברכות מאביו (רש\"י, 7X1); על-פי חז\"ל הוא למד בבית המדרש של שם ועבר\nבמשך ארבע עשרה שנה (7X2). הוא עבד שבע שנים בעד רחל (בר' כח:יח), וכאשר\nניתנה לו לאה במקומה, הוא מילא את שבע ימי המשתה (בר' כט:כז) ועבד שבע\nשנים נוספות בעד רחל (בר' כט:ל). היו לו אמנם שנים עשר בנים ובת, אבל הבן\nהשביעי שנולד לו היה גד (בר' ל:יא, וגד = 7). בסך הכול הוא עבד עשרים\nואחת שנים בבית לבן (7X3) והוא ירד למצרים עם שבעים נפש (7X10). יש גם\nגילאים משמעותיים בחייו הקשורים למספר שבע. לפי רש\"י, בגיל ששים ושלוש\nהוא קיבל את הברכות מאביו (7X9), בגיל תשעים ואחת הוא הוליד את יוסף\n(7X13) ובגיל מאה ארבעים ושבע (7X21) הוא נפטר (בר' מז:כח). המצריים\nהתאבלו עליו 70 יום (בר' נ:ג).<sup>[8]</sup> בעל הטורים מפרש את הפסוק\n\"ויחי יעקב\" ש \"ויחי\" = 34. בהיותו בגיל 130 אמר יעקב לפרעה שחייו היו\n\"מעט ורעים\", אבל 17 השנים האחרונות היו טובות. וגם 17 שנים הראשונות של\nיוסף לפני מכירתו היו שנים טובות. בסך הכול 34 שנים היו טובות וכולן\nקשורות לימי יוסף (4+3=7).</p>\n<p>יוסף, ששמו שווה לשם הוי\"ה שש פעמים כמו ששת ימי החול, מסמל את המאבק עם\nכוחות החולין. הוא שטנו של עשו והוא הנלחם לכל אורך הגלות על הישרדותם של\nישראל בגולה. יוסף בגימטריה – \"ציון\" (156), כי עניינו להביא את העם\nלציון \"וְהַעֲלִתֶם אֶת־עַצְמֹתַי מִזֶּה\" (בר' נ:כה), וכמו כל בניה של\nרחל, עניינו \"ראשית\": ראשית המלוכה (שאול מבנימין מבניה של רחל), ראשית\nהקדושה (משכן שילה שהיה בחלקו של יוסף), וראשית הגאולה (משיח בן יוסף\nהנלחם מלחמות ישראל על הארץ ויקבץ נידחי ישראל).<sup>[9]</sup> אז יושלם\nתפקידו, וכשיושלם תפקידו של יוסף יגיע זמן תפקידו של יהודה שממנו המלכות\nוהתיקון הסופי של עם ישראל. על כן, אף שספר בראשית מסתיים בנקודה זו,\nחז\"ל הוסיפו לנו את ההפטרה על פטירתו של דוד שהוא המשיח האחרון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, the six refer to the worldliness of Yosef's life. This explains IMHO why the five books of Moshe were given at Sinai (130=5*26).</p>\n<p>I believe this number represents a Godly spark that's reincarnated.

This is nearly impossible to do when following the prevalent traditions of the Ashkenazim and Sefardim, who have lost the tradition regarding the pronunciation of a “ד.” (Therefore, it is very likely that the Jews of Babylonia pronounced ״ד״ as a “th” sound.)</p>\n\n\n",

When in the <em>pa'al</em> form (<em>lilmod</em>) it means 'to learn', as opposed to the <em>pi'el</em> form (<em>le-lammed</em>) where it means 'to teach'.</p>\n<p>A nice example of the two forms juxtaposed can be seen in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Avot 2:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלֹא הַבַּיְשָׁן לָמֵד, וְלֹא הַקַּפְּדָן מְלַמֵּד</p>\n<p>Neither can the bashful learn, nor can the impatient teach</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Parenthetically, a crucial source in the context of discouraging women from studying Torah is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sotah.3.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Sotah 3:4</a>, which indeed talks about teaching one's daughter, not (explicitly) about a woman learning <em>per se</em>.)</p>\n<p>(A second parenthetical remark: there is also a different verb, <em>lehorot</em>, which has more of a specific connotation of 'instructing', rather than teaching in general.)</p>\n<p>The same holds true in Talmudic Aramaic. The root is י-ל-ף. <em>Lelef</em> means to learn, but <em>le-yallef</em> means to teach. (See e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jastrow%2C_%D7%99%D6%B0%D7%9C%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%A3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jastrow's dictionary</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

He notes that R' Filwarg was not aware of the shorter commentary to Shemot (Ibn Ezra wrote two commentaries, one long and one short, for some books), did not see any of the Ibn Ezra's other books, save for his commentary on Tanach, and as he didn't write a super-commentary on Ibn Ezra on Yesha'ayahu, perhaps he was not aware that such a thing existed. On the other hand, he did write a super-commentary on the pseudo-Ibn Ezra on Mishlei, Ezra and Nechemiah.</p>\n<p>It seems he learned only two prior super-commentaries: <a href=\"https://www.machonso.org/hamaayan/?gilayon=15&id=740\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Lipmann</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avi_Ezer?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avi Ezer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26223237\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Netter</a>'s commentary.</p>\n<p>He decided he would not comment on anything the Ibn Ezra wrote that was based on secular studies: philosophy, astrology and mathematics, and wouldn't look into the various \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/121613/ibn-ezra-list-of-secrets\">secrets</a>\" the Ibn Ezra mentioned in his commentary.</p>\n<p>Sometimes he chose to correct the Ibn Ezra's words, resulting in his sometimes guessing things that were correct per older manuscripts, but sometimes his ideas did not match the MSS (in other words, he did not examine any MSS). That's pretty much what Fleischer wrote about him and his commentary.</p>\n<p>As can be seen from <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44657&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the introductions to his book</a>, it seems that he had good ties with the rabbinical authorities of his city. From all of this info, in particular in his exceedingly traditionalist style of commentary, it seems he was very much Orthodox in his views and ways. As for whether his commentary is accepted - I think it is, just perhaps not so popular like Avi Ezer or some other super-commentaries. As a person, not much is known about him either way. I suppose that as long as his commentary is considered legitimate orthodox (i.e. not haskalic in nature), he is too.</p>\n\n\n",

He said that he had translated this text in Paris in 1339. Known as the “Epistola Samuelis Maroccani,’ it was later translated into several languages and widely circulated in Europe. In fact, it seems that he himself was the author, drawing largely from another tract in Arabic written by a Jewish convert to Islam, *Samawal b. Judah ibn Abbas, probably with the intent of presenting it as a Christian rather than a Muslim polemic. Alfonsus also translated another Arabic treatise by Samuel (or possibly wrote it himself): Disputatio Abutalib Saraceni et Samuelis Judaei quae fides praecellat: christianorum, an iudeorum, an saracenorum (Ms. Madrid Nac. 4402, fol. 103-10), a disputation between a Saracen and a Jew.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofmi0001unse_z7y7/page/40/mode/2up?q=alfonsus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages</a> writes this about him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ALFONSO BUENHOMBRE (late 13th c. - 1353), Alfonso Buenhombre (Alfonsus Bonihominis), a *Dominican missionary and polemist, born perhaps at *Toledo, led an adventurous life that took him notably to Egypt (1336), <em>Morocco (1337-1338) and Famagusta (1341) he was elected bishop of Morocco in 1344. His travels (and perhaps studies in one of the Dominican studia linguarum</em>?) gave him a good knowledge of Arabic, allowing him to translate several texts: an apocryphal <em>History of the patriarch Joseph</em> (1336), a <em>Life</em> of Sr Anthony the Hermit (1341). He also presented as translations from Arabic a <em>Disputatio Abutalib Sarraceni et Samuelis Iudei</em> on the best religion (1339-40) and his best known work, extremely widespread in the 14th c., the <em>Epistola rabbi Samuelis</em> (1339); in the latter case this is probably a fiction. This <em>Epistola</em> is an apology for the Christian faith, written in the character of a Jew addressing a co-religionist.

It had many improvements over the previous editions, which are listed in the volume of Maseches Niddah in their edition. This ultimately led to the Vilna Shabbos becoming the standard version everybody uses.</p>\n<p>The  term Shas is short for \"shisha sedarim\", or the six tractates of Mishnayos, but colloquially it is used for the Talmud Bavli, authored by Ravina and Rav Ashi. Minor tractates and Avot d'Rabbi Nosson are not part of what Ravina and Rav Ashi wrote, and neither is the Tosefta. Nevertheless, they are published in the Vilna edition, because they are useful supplemental material.</p>\n<p>So Avot is technically part of the \"shisha sedarim\" of Mishnah, but not Talmud Bavli. So it really depends on how you are using the word \"Shas\".  (But, it is important to remember that only the first five chapters of Avot are Mishnah. The sixth chapter is a Beraisa, which is why it starts with \"שנו חכמים בלשון משנה\", \"The Rabbis taught in the style of the Mishnah.\" This is also why there is no commentary of the Rambam and Bartenura to the sixth chapter, as they were writing a commentary on the Mishnah as a whole, not just Avot.)</p>\n<p>The Daf Yomi is to learn a page of the Talmud Bavli every day, so it does not include Mishnayos without Talmud or beraisos. (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14186/shkalim-kinim-midos-in-daf-yomi/14188#14188\">Interestingly</a>, it does include tractate Shekalim, even though it was published with Talmud Yerushalmi, not Bavli.) In the Vilna edition, that comes out to 2,711 pages, but that is just a random number without inherent significance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>What exactly is the Vilna Shas? Is it the only type of Shas used today?</em></p>\n<p>It is a Shas based on the typeset of the Shas printed in Vilna by the Romm family. It isn't the only one used today. Some but increasing rare Gemoras are still based on the Lemberg Shas (typeset in Lemberg) Both are based on the layout of Daniel Bomberg (a non-Jew) who based his Shas on the layout of Joshua Solomon Soncino, who printed the first individual Gomoras   in 1483, with the Gemora  in the middle of the page and  Rashi and Tosfos surrounding it. The Lemberg Shas is known to have minor inaccuracies. There are other Gemoras written but the Vilna Shas is the porotype for almost all other ones.</p>\n<p><em>I Know there are 2,711 pages of Daf Yomi; does this include the Mishnayos without Gemara?</em></p>\n<p>Daf Yomi does not include Mishnoyis for which there are no Gemora on</p>\n<p><em>If it doesn't include them, is the 2,711 number just a number for Daf Yomi rather than all of Shas? Wouldn't Shas include the Tractates without Gemara (like Avot) and perhaps even the minor ones?</em></p>\n<p>Daf Yomi also includes Sehkolim  which is from the Talmud Yerushalmi. There is some talk of incorporating  Mishnoyis into the Day Yomi cycle but it is unlikely to happen (too much of a change)</p>\n<p><em>Is Avot D'Rabbi Natan included in Shas?</em></p>\n<p>No. Although it was written in the same time period as the Gemora and is included in most volumes of Mescthas Avodah Zora, it was not authored by Ravina and Rav Ashi and does not have the status of Gemorah</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Some notes on editions of the Talmud Bavli (\"Shas\")-\nThe vilna Shas usually refers to the layout of the talmud page itself rather than the appendices. There have been a variety of additions in newer editions and there are also thin or reference volumes that leave all or many of them. There are some editions that have a different pagination but are not at all popularly used, at least not in Yeshiva circles. R shteinzaltz's edition got all the press, but I think the newer Hebrew edition take the same approach as Soncino/Artscroll. However the English is printed in the back which is a totally different layout. There is a green reference volume that has a multi column layout of just talmud with indexes. There was recently a not so well known project to add a number of commentaries to the page <a href=\"https://mamlechetcohanim.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mamlechetcohanim.com/</a>.\nAcademic commentaries on individual chapters often appear with a re-edited text of that chapter. There are usually printed section by section preceding the commentary.\nAside from layout, the text of the vilna edition is also the basis for almost all modern editions. The academic monographs mentioned above being the exception. More recently publishers will add notes or corrections (sometimes without any indication). This is more common in the Oz Vehadar edition as well as R shteinzaltz's. Transcriptions of manuscripts can actually be accessed freely and easily from fjms.genizah.org</p>\n<p>Because a number of respondents mentioned it I will remark that, although the common perception, Ravina and R Ashi are almost certainly not the final authors of the talmud.

All other breaking points are entirely customary.</p>\n<p>Historically some communities read sequentially to finish the Torah every 3 or so years, and others read to finish every year. The latter one is the widespread custom nowadays. To accomplish this, each community combines or splits various customary sections at various times as necessary into a new single reading for that week (with only seven readers and one haftara) to meet that community's goal.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the only way someone who always attends synagogue would miss any verses is according to some minority opinions that prohibit getting through (or what they call \"catching up\") too many customary sections at once (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/114686/759\">here</a>) for certain hard to understand reasons. But that is a minority opinion applied to a very rare case.</p>\n<p>(Note nowadays, nearly everyone follows one of 2 or 3 common sequences of how to combine and split the sections to accomplish this, and ad hoc rearrangements are incredibly rare.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If a <em>parsha</em> is skipped, it will indeed be read the following week. To achieve this, there are some Shabbatot where two Torah portions are being read (it will happen soon with Matot-Massei).

Yaakov buried Rachel in Kever Rochel in order that she should daven for those being led into Golus when the Beis Hemikdush was destroyed. Being a meilitz yoser however is no guarantee of results. In fact the Medrash relates how ALL the Avos and Imohos and Moshe Rabbeinu davened when the Beis Hemikdush was destroyed  but Hashem ONLY  answered RocheL with  מִנְעִי קוֹלֵךְ מִבֶּכִי וְעֵינַיִךְ מִדִּמְעָה כִּי יֵשׁ שָׂכָר לִפְעֻלָּתֵךְ נְאֻם ה וְשָׁבוּ מֵאֶרֶץ אוֹיֵב</p>\n<p>None of the seforim quoted here promise results.

Rav Moshe Feinstein זצ\"ל (שו\"ת אגרות משה חו\"מ חלק ב' סימן ל') was asked about ישיבות that allow their students to steal the answers to regents examinations. Rav Feinstein pointed out that aside from the prohibition of גניבת דעת, dishonesty on exams also constitutes actual גניבה of money. People rely on grades when making decisions about who to admit into schools of higher learning and even when making hiring decisions. When one is hired for a job based on falsified grades, he is stealing the financial gain that he achieves as a result of his dishonesty. Rav Moshe does address potential excuses that one may advance to justify dishonesty:\na.  One cannot claim that he is qualified for the job anyway and the grades are meaningless because grades do reflect a level of knowledge and diligence that are reasonable qualities for a potential employer to look at when making hiring decisions.\nb.  It is fairly common for ישיבה boys who dedicate themselves to תורה, to view secular studies as a waste of time. They may view studying as ביטול תורה, and instead opt to take whatever shortcuts are necessary to achieve a passing grade without having to take time away from their תורה studies. Rav Moshe points out the fallacy of such an argument. Such claims are more often based in laziness than in piety. In fact one who regularly cheats on exams trains himself to become lazy and inattentive in his intellectual pursuits, an attitude that will certainly carry over to his approach to torah study as well.\nc.  Rav Moshe concludes his תשובה by telling the questioner not to be too concerned by the rumors that ישיבות allow their boys to cheat. After all, such conduct runs so counter to everything that a ישיבה tries to accomplish and the values it tries to inculcate in the students, that these accusations cannot possibly be true. There is no doubt, argues Rav Feinstein, that those who hate ישיבות and are only interested in slandering the ישיבות and destroying them, are the source of such rumors.</blockquote><blockquote>\n2.  Rabbi Shmuel Wosner שליט\"א (שו\"ת שבט הלוי חלק י' סימן קסג) was approached by a principal of a girls school in Tel Aviv who was criticized for not allowing the students to cheat on exams. Apparently the parents in the school felt that it was a sort of tyranny being practiced by the principal in not allowing the students to be dishonest on exams. Rabbi Wosner, after expressing surprise that anybody would ever even need to ask this question, points out that cheating on exams involves multiple prohibitions. It is prohibited on account of גניבת דעת, lying (לא תשקרו ומדבר שקר תרחק), and it trains a person to become deceitful. Additionally, he runs the risk of being hired for a job for which he is not a competent candidate, thereby causing untold damage to his employer.</blockquote><blockquote>\n3.  Rabbi J.D. Bleich (Contemporary Halachic Problems II) adds two more considerations not mentioned by the other פוסקים.\na.  “Teachers are employed to serve as proctors during examinations. A teacher who is not vigilant in assuring honesty on the part of the examinees – or worse, one who tacitly condones dishonest conduct – accepts payment for services that (which) have not been rendered. This, too, is a form of theft.”\nb.  “When students or graduates of religious institutions engage in academic dishonesty of whatever form, their actions entail the gravest of all transgressions, namely, חילול ה', or profanation of the Divine Name.” (see רמב\"ם הלכות דעות פרק ו')</blockquote>\n<p><strong>If You “cheat on high school exams” then you violate both [Shemot 20:13] + [Vayikra 25:14] in order to falsely sell your “fraudulent intellectual property” for future financial aid from colleges | income from employers ( וְכִֽי־תִמְכְּר֤וּ מִמְכָּר֙ לַֽעֲמִיתֶ֔ךָ א֥וֹ קָנֹ֖ה מִיַּ֣ד עֲמִיתֶ֑ךָ אַל־תּוֹנ֖וּ אִ֥ישׁ אֶת־אָחִֽיו ).</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Learn them with the Beiur HaGra to understand why those opinions are followed from the machlokesin in the Gemara, and then learn the commentaries associated with that se'if.</p>\n<h3>A sample order of learning</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2OAHO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2OAHO.jpg\" alt=\"Shulchan Aruch\" /></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shulchan Aruch</li>\n<li>Be'er Hagolah (to see where the halachah is from--Gemara, Rambam, etc.)</li>\n<li>Beiur HaGra (to see how the machlokes plays out)</li>\n<li>The commentaries to the left and right of the Shulchan Aruch (in Orach Chaim that is the Turei Zahav, aka Taz, and the Magen Avraham).

Opinions on the subject ranged from that of\nHeraclitus, who held that one cannot step into the same river twice\n(because new waters are always flowing upon you), to Parmenides who\nheld that change is an illusion even in the case of a river. The question\ncrucially depends upon the concept of identity through time—whether\nwe can think of a river as “the same,” as persisting through time, even\nthough the waters coursing through it may be “different.”\nNow the Talmud asked almost the very same question, though camouflaging it in legal terminology: if one worships (prostrates himself\nbefore) a spring, are the waters of that spring made unfit to be offered as\na libation? “Is it the water before him that he worshipped, which is no\nlonger there, or is it the [entire] stream of water that he worshipped?”\n(Avodah Zarah, 48b). The question is not simply one of the idolater’s\nintention, since there is no way to determine that. Rather the question is\nphilosophical, whether or not the spring itself is an object which persists\nthrough time, and therefore could be the object of worship. We have\nhere the beginning of an ontological discussion, despite the ostensible\nhostility of the Talmud to “philosophy” or “Greek wisdom.”\nQuestions of identity permeate the halakhic literature. The Rabbis\nhad to decide when and whether two idols are the same deity; and at\nwhat point a sandal, undergoing alterations, becomes a different\nsandal. Identity questions can decide even questions of kashrut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note 12 reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The priestly portion of dough, hallah, can (outside the Land of Israel) be\nseparated retroactively: after the dough is baked into bread and eaten, what\nis left over is made hallah, retroactively permitting the non-priest to have\neaten the rest of the bread in the first place. (For a non-priest to eat the\npriest’s portion is a serious violation.) But since, in retrospect, the bread that\nwas baked contained the priestly portion, why do not the standard rules of\nkashrut dictate that the bread is made unkosher, just as if it had been baked\nwhile touching a forbidden substance? On examination, the question turns\non subtle issues of identity: are the flavor particles which allegedly contaminate this bread truly one with the hallah retroactively separated? It turns out\nthat this is a dispute between the Taz and his father-in-law, the Bah: the Taz\nin fact says that in any case of retroactive hallah separation, the rest of the\ndough must be more than sixty times the volume of hallah separated.

Assuming both communities are okay with eligibly-aged singles walking up to each other and striking up a conversation at kiddush after davening, no one would object if he was visiting Workville and started chatting with a single lady in Workville. Okay, now what happens if he does the exact same thing but at his own synagogue in Busytown?</p>\n<p><em>Really</em> hard to say there's an absolute open-and-shut halacha against it.

A rabbi must not abuse his power.  A rabbi must maintain appropriate interpersonal boundaries between himself and his congregants, and responsibly use the power and authority of the rabbinate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For an unmarried rabbi, romantic relationships with those with whom he serves as rabbi are subject to power imbalance and should be\navoided.  This creates challenges for single rabbis, especially in small communities, and careful guidance the RCA Ethics Committee or of senior colleagues is necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice the final caveat there ... \"consult higher-ups.\" So ... please be very, very cautious.</p>\n\n\n",

Ploni's mother is not halachically Jewish but has integrated into non-Orthodox Jewish culture. Ploni speaks, reads, and writes in Hebrew as his mother tongue, and knows no holidays other than Sukkos, Hanukkah, Pesach, etc. He fasts on Yom Kippur, has a huge traditional seder with all his family on Pesach, etc.</p>\n<p>Later, Ploni and his family move to America, where Ploni attends high school. Over the years, he gets more and more in touch with Orthodox Judaism, and starts to keep strict Shabbos, Yom Tov, kashrus, davening three times a day with tefillin and tallit, etc. Assume Ploni has been doing this, as well as studying a lot of Torah (daily Chumash portion, Gemara daf yomi, and Shulchan Aruch) and reading much Jewish literature, for two years, but is aware that he is not halachically Jewish. He has nonetheless not yet reached out to a Beis Din/rabbi.</p>\n<p>Would such a background have any tangible effect on Ploni's conversion process? I've read posts in this forum about the fact that Beis Dins should theoretically be more lenient toward \"Zera Yisrael\", but is this what takes place למעשה, especially if the conversion is done by the RCA?</p>\n<p>(Answers from personal experience would be appreciated)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question is how this background would affect his conversion process, but the set up of the case is that he has not approached a Beis Din for conversion. So, to start answering, we have to define where the process would start.</p>\n<p>One starting point would be the day that the boy approaches his rabbi and says that he knows that he is not really Jewish and wants to convert. I don't actually know this, but I was told that in case like this where the father is Jewish the Beis Din is supposed to be encouraging of the conversion, unlike when the potential convert is not Jewish, where they are required to be discouraging. In a case where he is already thoroughly acquainted with Jewish practice and commitment, the conversion would be very quick.</p>\n<p>A very different starting point is if the Rabbi discovers that the boy is not Jewish, knows that he is not Jewish, and is not making any attempt to convert. This demonstrated lack of desire to become Jewish is then a reason to distance the not-Jew from the Yeshiva. It is forbidden to teach a non-Jew Torah, and if he has decided that he does not want the responsibility of being a halachic Jew, we don't want to push him to make such a decision.</p>\n<p>This actually happened with a classmate of mine in high school. His father was a cohen, and we all thought that he was too, but his mother was not Jewish and mentioned this to him when he was already about 18. He did not ask to convert, and when the school found out about this months later they distanced him from the yeshiva.</p>\n<p>Caveat: I never spoke to this classmate after he left the yeshiva, and he left quietly, so I don't actually know if this was a push from the administration or a personal decision.</p>\n\n\n",

It is in general permitted to tear open packages of food (while being careful not to tear lettering on the package, and in some cases not to create a vessel) but forbidden to do so for non-food items.</p>\n<p>In the case of glued items, R Dovid Ribiat, the author of an encyclopedia on the 39 forbidden actions (<a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/the-39-melochos-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The 39 melochos</a>, vol. 3, p. 830) writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] all poskim [halachic decisors] agree that <strong>pulling apart any two\nobjects that are glued together</strong> (regardless of what material they are\nmade of) at their point of attachment <strong>is</strong> the melocho [<strong>forbidden</strong>\naction] of <em>koraya</em> [tearing]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, beyond the exception for food, <strong>there are also exceptions for medical needs</strong>. As such it is permitted to open band aids on Shabbat even when their protective paper is glued (R Ribiat p. 848, see bottom of <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/kashrus-kurrents-2019/6238/medicine-on-shabbos-questions-and-answers-from-rav-moshe-heinemann-shlita/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), one may tear the wrapping around a pill (Shmirat Shabat Kehilchata 33:4) and around a dressing (Shmirat Shabat Kehilchata 35:20). In all cases this is provided one doesn't tear the lettering if there is one.</p>\n<p>R Simcha Bunim Cohen writes similarly in Sanctity of Shabbos (vol. 1, p. 83-86) that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if a package is glued shut, one may not tear it open - even in a\nmanner that destroys the wrapping except in cases of food or\nmedicine [...] The dispensation applies only for obtaining items of\ntrue necessity such as food or medicine. It is forbidden to tear\ndestructively in order to obtain an item that is a mere convenience</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best summary of the entire issue with many detailed sources comes from R Akiva Niehaus (<a href=\"http://www.cckollel.org/parsha_encounters/5769/shelach_69.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Harav S.Z. Auerbach zt”l holds that one may open non-food packages on\nShabbos in a destructive manner <strong>provided that it is a tzorech Shabbos</strong>,\nbut the Mishna Brurah (according to one explanation) holds that one\nmay not open a non-food package on Shabbos. Since the Mishna Brurah’s\nposition is questionable, one may rely on the lenient opinion of Harav\nS.Z. Auerbach zt”l. However, the classification of “tzorech Shabbos”\nis quite vague and every case requires clarification if it is truly a\ntzorech Shabbos</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Two rabbis I discussed it with allowed opening such a package if they are considered a Shabbat need and of course if they are a form of bandage for the cornea.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

He spent time going through tomes. He then turned to the woman and provided her the answer.</p>\n<p>After she left, the rabbi’s students who had observed the interaction, asked the rabbi: “Rav, why did you spend to much time on that question? And why did you check the volumes? You obviously knew the answer. It was easy.”</p>\n<p>The rav replied, “Yes, it was a simple matter that required no research, no thought. But if I did not accord the woman’s question respect and give her time and research, she might never return to me with another question.

Jephthah said -- <em>I'm the political leader! I'm the military leader! If not for me we'd have lost! The big-scholar-priest guy should come to me!</em> And the high priest said -- <em>I'm the religious authority, and he put himself into this pickle!

It might be because I have very little knowledge on the religion and culture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"no no, it's true, they are all very clean and very hygienic when\nit comes to their kitchens and their food.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I said \"it's impossible for <strong>all</strong> Jewish people to be clean freaks, that's a sweeping generalisation\", they just kept reassuring me that their comments were true.\nI felt like I should immediately try to correct them on this, having known them for years I know they aren't racist, anti-Semitic, etc, however this comment made me slightly uncomfortable and their commitment to this belief of theirs was exclaimed with <strong>their experience of two Jewish girls who worked in the same company they used to work with and how they both always brought two lunch-boxes to work so they could also keep their high standards of food hygiene even in the work-place</strong>. I know they meant it as a kind of a compliment, but one that I have no way of knowing whether there's even a way to find out if it's true or not without anecdotal evidence.</p>\n<p>My immediate instinct is to just write it off as a 'backhanded-stereotypical-anti-Semitic-compliment' and move on but I care for this person deeply and don't want to write them off as having made anti-Semitic remarks without anything to go on besides basic assumptions of their comments.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason why I would like an answer to this is because of how my brain works. I have no doubt this person in my house is not anti-Semitic, but them having made remarks that could be anti-Semitic has me worried because for all they know about my life, I could be dating a Jewish person and am now extremely hesitant to the future prospect of bringing them to the house and meeting this person. Not that I think further anti-Semitic remarks would be said to them or any innappropriate jokes would be made, but more of just the general fear of having to explain any potential remarks to a hypothetical romantic interest whilst trying to explain to them that this person is not actually anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>Sorry if my first post here is a bit rambly.\nThanks in advance to any and all helpful answers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EdumacateMe</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The comment is an oversimplification, however there is some basis to it. The traditional dietary laws of Judaism, <em>kashrut</em>, do require some rather intricate thought processes of what goes into food, and they may have experienced some observant Jews following through on such actions.</p>\n<p>The two flaws here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>One can be a total slob while not technically violating <em>kashrut</em>; if someone needs to keep meat and milk separate and their kitchen contains both, then their kitchen needs a certain amount of organization and cleanliness. But suppose you have a \"greasy spoon\" restaurant that doesn't allow milk into the kitchen, and checks that all the meat entering is kosher. You could have a totally sloppy and unsanitary kitchen in which everything is technically kosher.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Many Jews don't observe the full laws of <em>kashrut</em> meticulously, and many don't observe them at all.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it's actually not too far from something like \"she's Saudi, so she must be okay fasting for 12 hours.\" It is true that most Saudis are Muslim, and that calls for fasting daylight hours during Ramadan, and most people who do so over time probably adapt to it, but there's no guarantee that a given person from the population follows the majority's religious laws, and even so, if they are good at it.</p>\n<p>So I wouldn't call it \"anti-Semitic\" per se, but assuming all Jews keep clean kitchens is a form of prejudice -- prejudging an individual based on the above assumptions.</p>\n<p>In this particular context, it's actually a logically-flawed prejudice at that -- most Jews who are okay with marrying non-Jews don't keep kosher.</p>\n<p>I don't consider it offensive, just a bit ignorant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My perspective is that it is indeed a simplification, but not intended to be negative. To try to 'argue it out' with someone has varying degrees of being unsuccessful. I may ask them further questions about the why's behind their statements.

But like is emphasized in kabbalistic and chassidic teachings, letters are defined in 2 ways.</p>\n<p>Written letters are defined by positive space/boundary. Engraved letters are defined by negative space/boundary.</p>\n<p>If one considers the analogy in the physical universe of matter (what we see and detect) and dark matter (the aspect of matter which we generally don't see or detect and which comprises according to current theories the majority of the universe), the idea isn't so difficult to comprehend. Dark matter would equate with the space around each letter in a Sefer Torah. For the Sefer Torah to be valid, each letter must have that clear space around it. When considering the entire klaf of the Sefer Torah (the surface of skin written upon which is also empty space) the dark matter is far greater than the matter (the ink).</p>\n<p>So absolute letter definition has both definition aspects resulting in the concept that the Torah contains (approximately) 600,000 letters. Doubling 304,805 results in exactly 609,610 letters.</p>\n<p>Dividing by 100 to draw the analogy to exact years results in 6,096 years that this world will last.</p>\n<p>This would then alter the calculations of how long a day in terms of G-d's years from Chapter 90:4 of Tehillim results in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday that has passed, like a watch of the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Messianic period begins before the end of the 6th day (actual Shabbat) following the halachic concept of when Shabbat should be brought in on Friday.</p>\n<p>Doing the math, 6096 years divided by 6 days means a single day is 1,016 years exactly. Dividing by 24 hours in a day results in 42.333 years per halachic hour.</p>\n<p>The earliest to take on Shabbat is Plag HaMinchah or 1.25 hours before actual night. 42.333 years times 1.25 results in 52.9 (53 years) before the 6,096 actual years that this world will exist, or the year 6,043 (which coincides to Plag HaMinchah of the sixth day) is the commencement of the Messianic period using that analogy with the actual number of letters of the Torah.</p>\n<p>But just to emphasize, this is not the way this concept has been taught, neither by the Vilna Gaon, nor within the teachings of Chassidut.</p>\n<p>The traditional teaching places Plag HaMinchah, meaning the beginning of the Messianic era, at the year 5750/51 or 1990/1991 on the secular calendar.</p>\n\n\n",

What definition of wicked is being considered here, the one in the Gemara, which I believe means a person who is predominantly evil, or the one in Tanya, where the person has unrepentant sins?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The very first verse in the Book of Psalms says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַ֥שְֽׁרֵי הָאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר ׀ לֹ֥א הָלַךְ֮ בַּעֲצַ֢ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים וּבְדֶ֣רֶךְ חַ֭טָּאִים לֹ֥א עָמָ֑ד וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב׃\n-- Happy is the man who has not followed the counsel of the wicked, or taken the path of sinners, or joined the company of the insolent. [Psalms 1:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In commenting on it, Malbim answers your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a difference between \"the wicked\" and \"the sinners\": \"the wicked\" sin intentionally and rebelliously, whether in matters between man and the Omnipresent or in matters between man and his fellow. That is why the Psalmist said, \"the counsel of the wicked,\" because they are the ones who sin with counsel and intentionally whereas in regards to the \"sinners\", it would not be right to say \"counsel\" since they do sin with counsel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I understand the second one to be the more accurate one at the end of the day, including any level/intensity of study. (I would actually suggest that \"engages in\" would be the best translation for עסק in this context. This is the translation used by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks in the Koren Siddur the same phrase in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Weekday%2C_Shacharit%2C_Preparatory_Prayers%2C_Torah_Blessings?lang=bi&p2=Jastrow%2C_%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%A1%D6%B7%D7%A7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birchas HaTorah</a>.)</p>\n<p>Rambam in his responsa (#524 in the mechon Yerushalayim edition, printed in part <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRambam.58.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) explains that one of the main reasons for this law is a concern that a non-Jew's beliefs regarding the validity of the Torah will lead him to misinterpret and misuse it, eventually leading Jews astray. I think this concern is applicable regardless of intensity of study. There is also a responsa from Rabbi Akiva Eiger (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49600&st=&pgnum=55\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1st collection, #41</a>) which assumes that the prohibition applies to basic study, discussing teaching scripture and the prayer book to a non-jew interested in conversion but prevented from doing so by European law in his day.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, it would seem to make sense to find a beit din locally to avoid travel expenses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The best way is for both spouses to appear before a beit din. (If necessary, or the couple can't stand to be in the same room, then the husband can appear before one beit din and arrange for a proxy to deliver the Get to his wife.) </p>\n\n<p>Most Orthodox rabbis in most Jewish cities can usually arrange for a <em>beit din</em> with the right expertise to travel in to the necessary city. (Though it may take some time to schedule that.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there a set price, or does it vary by beit din? What might the cost be and is there a way to keep the cost down?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It can vary, but it's basically the cost of the time of the experts. Anything more than a few hundred dollars is <strong>wrong.</strong> A competent beit din should never refuse someone who's truly unable to pay.</p>\n\n<p>After the ritual \"you are no longer married\" ceremony is over, a <em>beit din</em> can then, if the couple chooses, hear a civil case to determine the division of property and child custody. The longer that takes, the more expensive that will be. But if they just stick with the ritual ceremony, basically if no one tries to bog things down, it should be quick and cheap. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What documents will a beit din ask for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are only three variables in a Gett: the husband's name (including his father), the wife's name (including her father), and the name of the city where the Gett is being transacted. How to properly spell the city is the rabbi's job. So all they need is \"how do you spell your Hebrew name? Your English name? Your father's name? Are there any other names or nicknames by which you go?\" If the couple has a document like a ketubah, that can be helpful to ascertain some spellings of names. But generally, just think about the Hebrew names in advance and that should be all that's necessary.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How long will the process take, from beginning to end, assuming no unusual circumstances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Israel, the bureaucracy books them in 45-minute slots. Most other places allow 90 minutes to give people a bit more time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How does one locate a beit din to use for a Get?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Top-down: Email info@bethdin.org . The Beth Din of America (in NYC) will probably know who to call. Bottom-up: most <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/synagogue-finder/\" rel=\"nofollow\">local Orthodox rabbis</a> should know who to contact. (But once they give you a name, by all means do double-check it with bethdin.org to make sure it's someone reputable.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What other practicalities come to mind?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is nothing in a Gett about why they're getting divorced, whose fault it is, anything like that. The beit din will usually start off ascertaining that all hopes for reconciliation have failed, and should push no further. (Note: if the husband is a <em>kohen</em>, the process becomes more complicated as they'd be prohibited from remarrying.) If the couple can be civil to one another through the process, there's no reason for it to be antagonistic.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest suggestion in recent times concerns the wife: the typical Gett procedure will involve easily half a dozen men in the room, whereas the only woman required to be there is the wife. Even if everyone is trying to be understanding and helpful, that gender imbalance can feel awkward. There is no reason why she can't bring a friend or two for moral support, and in fact many beit dins encourage it today. (Note: \"moral support\" does not mean yelling at the rabbis.)</p>\n\n\n",

As such, Orthodox Judaism is hesitant to declare a single prophecy of that package fulfilled in case there is a snag in the fulfillment of the other and it turns out that that declaration was in error. The more Zionist groups of Orthodoxy will tend to declare that the State of Israel is definitely consistent with the prophecy and that the prophecy is in the process of being fulfilled. </p>\n\n<p>The less Zionist groups are concerned that the State of Israel doesn't fit their ideal of the Messianic state in that there is as yet no Temple, and the majority of Israeli Jews are secular. Also, they are wary of accepting Jewish States as the ones referred to in prophecy as the Hasmonean State turned to Saduceeism before becoming a puppet of Romans and the Bar Kochba state was also destroyed. Both of these states as well as other Jewish State movements such as the Revolt of 115 and the Shabetai Tzvi incident resulted in catastrophe.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>While the verse cited does predict a return of the Jews to the land of Israel it also includes details which have not yet been realized. The return of large numbers of Jews to Israel and an independent Jewish state are a necessary condition for the fulfillment of this prophecy (and others) but not a sufficient condition for its fulfillment. That this necessary condition has been met despite the overwhelming challenges has been taken by many as evidence that the full fulfillment of this prophecy is imminent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rambam <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188357/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 12</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are some Sages who say that Elijah's coming will precede the\n  coming of the Mashiach.

Am I supposed to pray both sections? If yes, each has a \"Shema Israel\" prayer in it, and in the morning I'm supposed to say it once, not twice. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This answer is based on the edition of <em>Tehillat Hashem with English Translation</em> published by Merkos L'inyonei Chinuch 1990.  Page numbers are for this edition.</p>\n\n<p>The section titled \"Morning Blessings\" begins on page 6.  It includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>blessing for washing hands</li>\n<li><em>asher yatzar</em> (the blessing for the body) and <em>elohai neshama</em> (for the soul)</li>\n<li>the 15 <em>nisim b'chol yom</em> (daily miracles like waking up, strength, opening the eyes of the blind, etc) and the <em>y'hi ratzon</em> (may it be Your will) petitions that follow</li>\n<li>blessing for torah study, and torah-study passages</li>\n<li>blessings for putting on the <em>tallit</em> and <em>t'fillin</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is then followed, on page 12, with the section entitled \"Shacharit - the morning prayer\".  This begins with <em>mah tovu</em> (how goodly are your tents O Jacob) and proceeds through the morning service (which I won't enumerate here).</p>\n\n<p>Now, to your questions:</p>\n\n<p>Yes, you are supposed to pray both sections, but you might do some at home.  The blessing on washing that begins the first section is something you say immediately upon arising in the morning.  The other prayers in this section, at least up to torah study, are often said at home too, though I think some say them in the synagogue too and I don't know what governs this choice.  (In particular, I do not know what Chabad does.)</p>\n\n<p>The tallit and t'fillin are donned in the synagogue if you are praying in a synagogue, so that and everything after it should be done with the community rather than at home.  (If you can't pray with a community you're still obligated to pray so you do so at home, but that is not the preference.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't see <em>Sh'ma Yisrael</em> in the first section you list, but I do see it early in the second, before <em>Barchu</em>.  The <em>Sh'ma</em> and <em>V'ahavta</em>, but not the other two paragraphs after, are on page 17 amidst other passages from <em>Tanach</em>.  This is part of a longer torah-study passage.  I would guess that this reading of the <em>Sh'ma</em> fulfills (or helps to fulfill) the obligation of <em>torah study</em>, but it does not fulfill the obligation to <em>say the Sh'ma</em> because it is incomplete and not in its proper place for that.  (Note the section on page 45 entitled \"Laws pertaining to the recital of Shema\".)  The <em>Sh'ma</em> of the morning service is on page 46 and following.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether any of this can be skipped (e.g. do you have to read <em>all</em> the torah-study passaages?), consult your rabbi.  But the two sections you list in your question are not redundant; you do both.</p>\n\n\n",

This would be because the \"witnesses\" who signed the get are probably not valid and the \"bait din\" that had the get written probably do not know the technicalities of a get. Given that a valid bait din is used, then the question would be is the heterodox \"marriage\" valid or did a valid marriage take place even though the \"ceremony\" itself was not valid.</p>\n\n<p>Since two kosher witnesses are required and the husband must present the ring in front of them, there is the possibility that a non-Orthodox \"ceremony\" <strong>may</strong> actually be valid (bediavad - after the fact). That is, there may be two kosher witnesses among the guests who see the \"ceremony\". As a result, there are those that would say that a get is required in order to avoid problems. This is especially the case when the couple intend to marry, since intercourse with intent for kiddushin is one of the valid methods from the Torah. I have found a <a href=\"http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/divorce-halakhic-perspective\" rel=\"nofollow\">citation</a> that says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The “legal formalities” exceptions to the need for a get have also\n  been applied with respect to marriages in which a double-ring ceremony\n  took place, as well as to Jewish marriages that are performed by\n  Reform or Conservative rabbis. Rabbi Moses Feinstein ruled that Reform\n  and Conservative ceremonies never meet the formal requirements of a\n  valid marriage “in accordance with the laws of Moses and Israel”\n  (Igrot Moshe, Even ha-Ezer part 3, siman 25; part 4, siman 77 and 78).\n  However, Rabbi Hayyim (Howard) Jachter, in an article entitled\n  “Conservative Kiddushin,” has taken the position that, with respect to\n  Conservative marriage ceremonies, such blanket rulings cannot be made\n  and that the validity of each Conservative marriage must be decided on\n  a case-by-case basis (Tehumin 18 [1998]: 84–91).</p>\n  \n  <p>In an Israel rabbinic court ruling of 2003, Rabbi Shlomo Dichovsky was\n  asked to determine the status of Reform marriages. He held that an\n  Israeli couple who married both in Cyprus in a civil ceremony and in\n  Israel in a Reform ceremony were not married “in accordance with the\n  laws of Moses and Israel” but were married in accordance with Jewish\n  law. Dichovsky deemed the Cypriotic-Reform marriage to be a “Noahite”\n  marriage. A “Noahite” marriage is not null and void ab initio. It is a\n  marriage that Jewish law recognizes and whose termination must be\n  declared by a court of law. Dichovsky held that the Israel rabbinic\n  courts could terminate the Noahite marriage following the\n  determination that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. But\n  since the “Noahite” marriage was not “in accordance with the laws of\n  Moses and Israel,” there was no need for the husband to give his wife\n  a get, or for the wife to accept the get in order for the marriage to\n  terminate. Thus, by applying the “formalities” of Orthodox marriage\n  ceremonies in such a manner as to invalidate Reform ceremonies, Rabbi\n  Dichovsky’s ruling presents an interesting solution for those Israeli\n  couples who choose to marry in non-Orthodox ceremonies and who want to\n  avoid the pitfalls of Jewish divorce law. It also preserves the\n  jurisdiction of the rabbinic courts over such marriages (Ha-din\n  ve-ha-dayyan [The Law and Its Decisor] 5 (February 2004): 5–9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Moshe Feinstein, z\"l</a>, maintained that marriages performed by the new, modern-era Jewish movements (that are based on a rejection of traditional halacha, e.g. Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist; henceforth: neoJewish) are completely invalid in the eyes of halacha. He even went so far as to suggest that these marriages were less valid than secular marriages (which he also invalidated) in that the couple erroneously assumed the ceremony was valid and had no further intent to marry at a later time. </p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Eliyahu_Henkin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Yosef Henkin, z\"l</a>, maintained that both secular and neoJewish marriages were valid, either because there may have been valid witnesses present at the ceremony, or because the assumption of marriage at consummation would itself generate a halachic marriage. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, because of the myriad legal minutiae essential to effect a valid halachic divorce, no traditional halachic authority recognizes neoJewish divorce ceremonies. As such, a marriage created by traditional Judaism (\"Orthodox\") could never be ended halachically in ceremonies performed by neoJewish movements. The converse, however, is not true in that it is highly unlikely that neoJewish movements would not recognize the far stricter requirements of traditional Judaism to effect either a halachic marriage or halachic divorce. Since even Rav Moshe Feinstein, z\"l, required a halachic divorce when possible even from the neoJewish or secular marriages he assumed to be invalid, it stands to reason that the advantage is to always have a traditional, halachic, \"Orthodox\" divorce regardless of the movement which effected or attempted to effect the original marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If a halachically valid marriage is not successfully ended, subsequent relationships with, e.g., a second \"husband\" are considered adultery in the eyes of halacha. Further, the progeny from the later unions are considered \"certain\" or \"uncertain\" <em>mamzerim</em>. Certain mamzerim may marry only other certain mamzerim and converts.  Uncertain mamzerim may marry only converts.  In either case, the progeny would continue to carry the halachic stigma of the certain or uncertain mamzer and have the identical rules as these original products of adultery with regard to whom they can marry).</p>\n\n<p>See, e.g. <em>Iggroth Moshe Even Haezer</em> I 74 and 76 and IV 75; Hapardes 38:7 (October, 1964): 5-6 reprinted in <em>Kitvei Hagri’a Henkin</em> vol. 2, pp. 123-125; all cited <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2007/03/rabbi-adam-mintz-rabbi-henkin-and-first.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Reform movement generally doesn't require Gittin.</p>\n\n<p>Conservative practices will vary.</p>\n\n<p>An Orthodox Get will be accepted by all denominations.

    "title": "\"Love thy neighbour as thyself\" while reviewing academic papers",
    "content": "# \"Love thy neighbour as thyself\" while reviewing academic papers\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Academic publications are judged, mainly, on two grounds: correctness and importance. A paper which contains incorrect statements should, unquestionably, be rejected from publication. However, importance is a more subjective issue. Typical rejection message related to importance are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"You present a new problem and solve it correctly, but the new problem is not very useful\".</li>\n<li>\"Your paper deals with a specific topic and it is not sufficiently general to be published\".</li>\n<li>\"Your results are correct but they are not surprising; the proofs are not technically challening.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Evidently, importance is subjective: what seems \"useful\"/\"general\"/\"challenging\" to one person, may seem the opposite to another person.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: when I review a paper (assuming it is correct), what should I do when I feel the paper is not sufficiently \"important\"?</p>\n\n<p>If it were my paper, I would certainly want the everyone to see its importance. So, based on rules such as: \"love thy neighbor as thyself\" (\"ואהבת לרעך כמוך\"), \"love your friend's property as your own\" (\"יהי ממון חברך חביב עליך כשלך\") and especially \"love your friend's honor as your own\" (\"יהי כבוד חברך חביב עליך כשלך\"), apparently I must consider the paper I am reviewing as important, too. Hence, I should recommend to accept it (again, assuming it is correct).</p>\n\n<p>Is this reasoning correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>You have restricted your understanding of “neighbour” to the author of the paper. </p>\n\n<p>If, however, you considered  the neighbour to be the other possible readers of the paper (of whom there are of course many more than the author), then those neighbours would rather have your best judgement of the importance of the paper.  To test this hypothesis, consider your feelings when you have started to read a paper which was supposed to be important but turned out otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest that this reasoning is more sound than that in the question. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>None of the principles that you cited imply that your line of thinking should be identical to that of your neighbor. Your reasoning does not make sense. There absolutely is value in making sure that your rejection is diplomatic; however, the fact that somebody else thinks that his paper is important does not mean that it is. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, you should try to find the importance in the paper that you are reviewing (you don't need a Jewish teaching for that; that's the job of the academic reviewer). But </p>\n\n<pre><code>I love my friend + He thinks this paper is important =/= I think this paper is important.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The entire purpose of your job is to express your opinion on the publication-worthiness of academic papers. If you just start pretending that all papers are important, then you aren't doing your job.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm going to \"harp\" on your statement of \"love your friend's honor as your own\" (\"יהי כבוד חברך חביב עליך כשלך\").</p>\n\n<p>Place that together with your 1st statement of quoting .ואהבת לרעך כמוך</p>\n\n<p>If you translate the 2nd one literally, it says, \"(Show) love TO your neighbor as to yourself.\". This means,, essentially, place yourself in your neighbor's position. Whatever you would do to love yourself, and pamper yourself, and want the best for yourself (assuming that you DO love yourself - many people, BTW, don't, but I assume that's not you) - that's what you do for your friend / colleague, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The 1st statement, about the honor of your friend should be as dear to you, applies very specifically to your academic situation, here.</p>\n\n<p>If you presented <strong>your</strong> paper, how would <strong>you</strong> wish to be honored? Wouldn't you want honest, harsh but diplomatic criticism? Would you want your colleague to just \"pass off\" your paper to the public only because he likes you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings, even if the public gets a \"nonsense\" or \"trivial\" paper? (I've read plenty of academic \"nonsense\" myself, and I'm an \"outsider\". I won't delve further, though.) Isn't it more honorable to you to publish a useful paper, and if it isn't that way, wouldn't you want your colleague to tell you that and suggest ways to improve it? Wouldn't you be more honored by a useful publication that the public can use?</p>\n\n<p>If you can answer the above questions honestly, I think, you can determine what you should do. It makes more sense to criticize if it's necessary.</p>\n\n\n",

In the responsum, they state that while it is technically problematic for a non-Jew to say the blessing which includes \"... who sanctified <em>us</em> with his commandments,\" doing so is seen as a \"positive indication that the home is to be Jewish.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The non-Jewish spouse's participation in the Friday evening ritual at home has evolved naturally. Frequently she does light the <em>shabbat</em> candles and through this indicates a wish to establish some ties with Judaism at home. Technically, of course, it is inappropriate for a Christian to recite the traditional benediction as it contains the words <em>asher qidshanu</em> - \"who sanctified us with his commandments,\" which indicates an obligation imposed on Jews. We have, however, taken this act as a positive indication that the home is to be Jewish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The responsum goes on to say that the same logic cannot be extended to synagogue services. \"[N]on-Jews may not lead in essential segments of the synagogue service or sections which utilize such phrases as 'who has sanctified us.'\"</p>\n\n<p>Since your question indicates that you are specifically asking about home observances, I think it is can be understood that from the position of the Reform movement you may participate as you wish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You may certainly do the prayers and make the kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>It would be best if you're still doing <em>something</em> that's not Sabbath-observant at some point in the day.

(I believe the Aruch HaShulchan tries to argue that he should even say the birchat kohanim replacement prayer that the chazzan inserts in <em>chu\"l</em>.)

There is one which has many stripes of color(the one we see commonly) and then there is the rainbow which is completely blue(techeiles color).

One of the explanations for 7 is that the seventh (unpaired) animal is the one that was to be sacrificed. Other commentaries state that it was supposed to be seven <strong>pairs</strong> of clean animals to allow for male and female sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch states that one of the reasons for the kosher laws given later is that the Bnai Yisrael were to be an Am Kohanim (nation of priests) and as such were only allowed to eat those animals that were allowed to be offered on the altar of Hashem (by Noach and his descendents). Note that the animals sacrificed by Bnai Noach were not restricted to the animals that Bnai Yisrael could sacrifice. According to Rav Hirsch, any animal that is kosher for Bnai Yisrael to eat (after the giving of the Torah) was allowed to be sacrificed by Noach (even for example a deer or a giraffe).</p>\n\n<p>Also see the answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3257/how-many-kosher-animals-were-in-noachs-ark?rq=1\">How many Kosher animals were in Noach's Ark?</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I would like to input my thoughts to this discussion; Moses is writing this book and is not describing for us modern readers. He is giving an account and what the people of Israel new what was food to eat, not all animals are considered food except for the one's YHVH described. An animal that is considered food had to go through a procedure before being considered clean or defiled depending how close they followed YHVH's instructions. YHVH would have told Noah what to sacrifice just like he must of told Adam because he was covered in animal skin himself and Cain did not sacrifice what he was to do and many others did not obey which began the downward spiral of destruction. Just as we see in the beginning how YHVH created the sabbath day to keep and had to let Israel know it again. YHVH had to tell Abraham but it doesn't mention that he did.</p>\n\n\n",

His words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקצתם קורים בפתח ומקצתם קורין נוטה לצירי וכן הוא מנהג האשכנזים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other commentators discuss the distinction between a <em>patach</em> and a <em>shva</em>, and many talk about using <em>chataf patach</em>, however I have not seen any other discussion of this \"tending toward <em>tseirei</em>\" besides those who quote the <em>Bach</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the <em>Bach</em> mean <em>tseirei</em> the same way we do?</strong> (From the <em>Be'er Heiteiv</em>, who quotes the <em>Bach</em>, and from the discussion of the <em>Be'er Heiteiv</em> in <em>siman</em> 6 <em>seif katan</em> 2, it would seem that he at least understands the <em>Bach</em> to mean a <em>tseirei</em> the same way we do.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does this pronunciation persist today?</strong> The <em>Bach</em> says that the \"tending toward <em>tseirei</em>\" pronunciation is the common <em>minhag</em> of <em>Ashkenaz</em>, so one would expect that it does survive.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You're right. \"tending toward <em>tseirei</em>\" is exactly equivalent to the <em>shva</em> that you already heard about.

Rather, the issue is in the timing -- Avraham laughed when he heard the news, but Sarah didn't believe that she would have a child until she actually saw her body change and her period return.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר ה' אל אברהם וגו'. צריך לדעת אומרו תיבת זה, עוד למה אמר תיבת לאמר. גם כל הכתוב מיותר שלא היה לו לומר אלא למה צחקה:<br>\n  אכן הכוונה היא להיות שמצינו בפרשה הקודמת כי אברהם גם כן צחק כשאמר לו ה' בשורת הזרע דכתיב (פ' י''ז) ויפול אברהם וגו' ויצחק ולא ראינו שהקפיד ה' על שצחק אברהם, ויאמר האומר מה נשתנית צחיקת שרה מצחיקת אברהם. ומצינו לאונקלוס שנתכוון לתרץ זה במה שתרגם צחיקת אברהם וחדי וצחיקת שרה וחייכת אבל על מי סמך הקב''ה להבין ב' פירושים משונים בתיבה אחת:<br>\n  אכן הנכון הוא כי הקב''ה דקדק בדבריו טעם הקפדתו על שרה ולא על אברהם, ותמצא כי אברהם בעת הבשורה צחק מה שאין כן שרה לא צחקה בעת שנתבשרה אלא בעת שראתה עדנה כאומרו ותצחק שרה וגו' אחרי בלותי היתה לי עדנה הרי זה מגיד כי לא נתאמת אצלה הבטחת הלידה עד שראתה השינוי ועל זה הקפיד ה', והוא אומרו למה זה צחקה פי' על צחוק זה אני מקפיד ולא על צחוק שלך, והטעם כי צחוק זה כוונתה לומר האף אמנם שנתאמת אצלה אחר מעשה שתלד וזה יגיד כי לא האמינה ולא סמכה דעתה על הבטחתי אותה כי הוא דבר פלא היפלא מה' דבר וגו':</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Bechor Shor (17:17) defends Avraham because he bowed in gratitude when laughing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויפל אברהם על פניו ויצחק:<br>\n  נפילתו והשתחויתו מוכיחים שהאמין, כי דרך הודאה הוא שמח וצחק והודה והשתחוה. \n  ואמר: כמה נס גדול, וכמה טובה בכללה שמשנה סדרו של עולם עלי לטובה...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In case you haven't noticed, the commentators quoted above all defend Avraham's actions, for different reasons. The Midrash Hagadol (17:17) is one of the few who actually criticize Avraham. He says that Avraham was meant to understand from Sarah's rebuke that what he did was wrong without explicitly being told so.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מפני מה מיחה הכתוב בשרה ולא מיחה באברהם, שנאמר \"ויפל אברהם על פניו ויצחק\"? אלא ללמדך ששנים שעשו דבר שלא כהוגן והיה אחד מהם גדול ואחד קטן ואין ממחין אלא בקטן והגדול מרגיש מאליו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually, I think it is obvious that there are two different laughters being spoken of. Avraham Avinu heard it from Hashem Himself. Obviously, Avraham is not laughing off Hashem's word. His laughing is because he already envisions it happening, and being so outlandish he laughs about it.</p>\n\n<p>Sarah Imanu, on the other hand, heard it now for the first time, from people (it seemed). There is no reason to be excited about it already happening just because someone mentioned it. Her laughter was therefore obviously laughing off the ridiculous idea. She didn't, God forbid, knowingly dismiss a promise from Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there is really not much to complain about, since she actually had no reason to think it will happen. Therefore, the Pasuk just says, is anything too hard for Hashem? The complaint is merely about laughing it off; about dismissing it so easily.</p>\n\n<p>The Medrash says that this complaint was just an excuse for Hashem to communicate with her.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that the <strong>blue</strong> one is the rainbow that is zocher habris because techeiles is from the lashon of kilyon (destruction).</p>\n  \n  <p>A side note: The Ben Ish Chai parshas Eikev 17 writes that from this drush from Yaaros Dvash it would appear that one should not make a bracha on a colored rainbow since only the <strong>blue one</strong> is the reminder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Saying a blessing on a rainbow requires one to see it.

(E.g. Judges, Jeremiah, Esther.)</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud is the work of men many, many years later, reflecting the teachings and traditions they received -- and their debates on them.</p>\n\n<p>A Torah book is handled as more sacred than, say, a book of Esther, which is more sacred than a volume of the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we can't understand the commandments contained in the Torah without the explanation of the Talmud. Too many things are too vague. And we believe that an oral tradition was given alongside the Torah that was eventually recorded in the Talmud. </p>\n\n<p>So they serve different purposes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My answer will be a further clarification of what Shalom said.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah, which means Teaching, refers to the first five books of Moses, are typically believed to be passed directly from God to Moses. These first five books are treated with the most \"reverence\" since they are considered God's most \"direct\" or \"pure\" words to mankind. In Christian translations, you will often hear statements of \"And they read the Law of Moses\" \"They found a scroll of the Law,\" \"Didn't Moses tell you in the Law?\" These statements are simplified attempts at translating the word Torah. Since the first five books of Moses contain many laws, many Christian translators translate Torah as \"law.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Torah is treated with the most reverence. Which means that no letters of it are changed, it is always kept in a separate place, is always well taken care of, and things like that. But when a Jew has a question on beliefs or what he should do in a given situation, more often than not he will not look up his quandary in the Torah. But instead will search for books from modern Rabbis, or the Talmud, or other works of laws or interpretations. This is because while we believe the Torah is immutable and pure, we also believe it is vague, and even slightly dangerous if not viewed in the proper lens. Someone could read it and come away with the notion that if one meets an adulterer, one should stone that person to death. Or if one is blinded by his fellow man, then his fellow man should be blinded. Both of these striahgt forward interpretations are viewed as incorrect by the Talmud, and we follow the Rabbinic interpretation of how to implement these laws, rather than by following the laws directly. So for example the adulterer can only be put to death after going to court, and then only on the testimony of witnesses who saw the action. In the case of the person who is blinded, his blinder has to pay for his recovery, and a value of how much work he will lose on account of being blinded, etc etc.</p>\n\n<p>We also have a very sharp distinction between the written text of the Torah and its possible interpretations. If you read a Christian translation of Exodus, they make it very clear that God wrote the second set of tablets, they do it subtly by saying \"and He wrote the tablets...\" but the Hebrew text doesn't actually tell you who the \"he is. The he could be Moses or God. We instead look to our commentators to hear the different interpretations possible, and we come to our own personal conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the Bible is viewed as sacred, but to a lesser degree. God spoke to Moses face to face, God spoke to the rest of the prophets in dreams and visions. So think of it  like the telephone game, the further down the chain someone is, the less reliable the message. Moses had the most direct revelation, the other prophets had less direct revelation. These books are also treated with sanctity, but again nearly no one opens them up for personal guidance on their lives.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (and further Rabbinic writings) are considered the least holy, but they are the most relied upon/used by Jews in their daily lives. i wanted to stress this point because a Christian person might hear that the Torah is our most sacred book and therefore would figure that we read it all the time to find out what God wants. But typically, Jews open up the Talmud or other Rabbinic works to try and discover how God wants them to live their life. And so while these Rabbinic books aren't considered as \"sacred,\" because they aren't written by prophets, they are what most Jews rely upon to live their lives. A good example of why this might be would be the following:</p>\n\n<p>According to the Torah, if a married man dies childless, the surviving brother is supposed to marry his widowed sister in law, have a child with her, and that child will carry the name of the deceased brother. Modern Judaism no longer practices this, due to the progression of ideas and laws passed to the Rabbis. One could make the argument that they've annulled God's law. But almost no one in this day and age thinks the right or Godly thing to do is to force the surviving brother to marry the widow. </p>\n\n\n",

There are other movements in Judaism that use their own ideas or outside ideas to be interjected into Judaism but orthodoxy as it defines itself is the one that uses Torah sources to define itself. This can be confusing for someone not currently an orthodox Jew as within Orthodoxy there are many different paths to follow and within those paths not everyone is 100% consistent as the human condition makes people (whether they realize or not). Something to consider is that Judaism isn't a religion. It's not an all in or nothing type of a deal when you are born Jewish. For such a person it is within the fabric of their being to be Jewish. They then can chose how to be involved in their Jewishness (hopefully by keeping the Torah as G-d wants us to). As for someone who converts. There is an idea that this person had within them a spark of a Jewish soul which only needed to be nurtured in order to be fully revealed which is done through the conversion process and by living a fully Jewish life according to the Torah. Like the Talmud says... a convert who converts. That is what was meant by true way to convert. Now as for the practical process of how that happens... </p>\n\n<p>As for how to convert there are a few steps...\n1) Acceptance of the whole Torah in belief and in practice. Before one finishes there are some comandments one will not fully observe such as sabbath and tefillin. (A rabbi can explain to you the details when you talk to him). Most conversion Rabbis require a period of learning as well. Strictly speaking that isn't part of the conversion process but the Rabbis want to set you up for success so that way when someone does convert they know how to live as a Jewish person according to the Torah.\n2) Bris Milah/circumcision. (Males only) If you haven't had one you will need to get one. If you have someone will need to inspect to find out if complete and no foreskin remains.If complete then only a small drop of blood is required.\n3) Mikvah. After the circumcision one showers, cuts nails, removes all dirt and anything that would come between the person and the mikvah water. Before going in the Rabbis will usually ask once more if you are sure if you want to go through with this as the Jewish people are persecuted and it will not be easy to keep all of the mitzvas. If yes you go under once then you say a blessing and then go under once more\n4) Sacrifice. Since the Beis HaMikdash currently does not stands were are not permitted to bring sacrifices but in the time of Moshiach we will once more and all converts will bring their sacrifices then</p>\n\n\n",

This is what you did to the generation of the flood and the generation of dispersion (following Noach).</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure of Rashi's source for this explanation, here. However, given that this is correct, it seems that God's judgement method towards humanity was much stricter until Avraham came. It seems that God exhibited more of his merciful attribute afterwards. Why was the judgement more severe then, and less severe afterwards? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It was not true that Hashem punished the wicked and the righteous together. In the time of Noach, only Noach and his family were tzadikim (and were less than the ten Avraham was asking for). Thus, everyone who died in the mabul deserved it.</p>\n\n<p>The punishment of the dor haflaga was actually a salvation of the world as the dispersion caused the wicked to lose power and allowed everyone the freedom to establish their own societies. Thus, it actually saved the world from having to be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi is saying that the people who <strong>do not understand</strong> will think that Hashem performs communal punishment with the righteous and the wicked punished together. As a result, they will think that it is not worth being righteous since they will be punished anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham was attempting to save the cities so that those who were potentially righteous could have a chance to do teshuvah. Even the reshaim could do teshuvah if they are frightened enough.</p>\n\n<p>Your comment brings up Avimelech in Perek 20 Pasuk 4 of Vayeirah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד: וַאֲבִימֶלֶךְ לֹא קָרַב אֵלֶיהָ וַיֹּאמַר אֲדֹנָי הֲגוֹי גַּם\n  צַדִּיק תַּהֲרֹג</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"4\">\n  <li>And Abimelech had not come near to her, and he said, \"O Lord, will You kill even a\n  righteous nation?</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>ה: הֲלֹא הוּא אָמַר לִי אֲחֹתִי הִוא וְהִיא גַם הִוא אָמְרָה אָחִי\n  הוּא בְּתָם לְבָבִי וּבְנִקְיֹן כַּפַּי עָשִׂיתִי זֹאת</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"5\">\n  <li>Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister'?

The claim is actually so ludicrous that Hashem does not even need to say that it is not true. We can see this because Avimelech has to issue a decree telling everyone to leave Avraham and Sarah alone. At least they were better than the Egyptians because Par'o could not trust his people to obey such a command. Thus, even Avimelech realized that this was not a valid argument. Also, Hashem did not threaten to kill everyone, this was Avimelech stating that if <strong>he</strong> were killed (as the king) the entire nation would be destroyed. Thus, even if the people were completely righteous, Hashem had not threatened anyone other than Avimelech.</p>\n\n<p>Avimelech says (according to Rav Hirsch's translation) \"In the innocence of my heart and the integrity of my hands have I done this\" Hashem answers \"in the innocence of thy heart\" but not \"integrity of thy hands\" which means, yes he thought she was not married, be he still sinned by kidnapping her.</p>\n\n\n",

Not asking at all does not necessarily imply lack of fear of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Q2: You ask if Avrohom was worried that ANYONE might kidnap Sarah, not just the king. </p>\n\n<p>V 11: says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Abraham said, \"For I said, 'Surely, there is no fear of God in\n  this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that the word “they” indicates just that. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Grammar question in Vayera\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been learning Bereshit with Rashi in school, and while reading a part of Vayera, I noticed that there were two grammatically different statements in one Pesuk.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bereshit (18:7)<br>\n  וְאֶל הַבָּקָר רָץ אַבְרָהָם וַיִּקַּח בֶּן בָּקָר רַךְ וָטוֹב וַיִּתֵּן אֶל הַנַּעַר וַיְמַהֵר לַעֲשׂוֹת אֹתוֹ<br>\n  \"And to the cattle did Abraham run, and he took a calf, tender and good, and he gave it to the youth, and he hastened to prepare it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first it says \"וְאֶל הַבָּקָר רָץ אַבְרָהָם\" (To the cattle ran Abraham).<br>\nAnd then it says \"וַיִּתֵּן אֶל הַנַּעַר\" (And he gave it to the youth).</p>\n\n<p>Why is it sometimes \"to <em>this</em> he did <em>this</em>\" and sometimes \"he did <em>this</em> to <em>this</em>\"?</p>\n\n<p>I know the question may sound dumb, but I believe there's a meaning behind every word in the Torah. And things were written in a way for a reason.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe this is the source for the comment in Pirqei DeRabi Eliezer [Chap. 35] that Avrohom followed the calf all the way to the <em>Me'orath HaMachpeiloh</em>. וירץ אל הבקר implies they were 'fixed' in their place and he ran to them; ואל הבקר רץ אברהם implies that they were creating their own place, in other words, they [or one of them] had moved prompting Avrohom to give chase. (I am not commenting whether or not this Midrash is to be taken literally - merely that this appears to be its source.]\nOn a simple level of the text, ואל הבקר רץ implies a greater alacrity: in other words, 'and to the cattle Avrohom had <em>already</em> ran' - he was there already [!] as opposed to a narrative וירץ אל - 'and he ran to'..</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I wasn't able to locate an explanation that addresses, directly, the grammatical aspect, here. Of course, the phrasing is grammatically correct, just \"unparalleled\" in that the beginning of the verse mentions the object / place first and the end mentions the verb first.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of why that occurs, here, specifically, I'm inferring a \"principle\" mentioned in</p>\n\n<p>Messilat Yesharim 8:3 (excerpt; Sefaria English translation):</p>\n\n<p>וכן תמצא כל מעשיהם של צדיקים תמיד במהירות. אברהם כתוב בו (בראשית יח): וימהר אברהם האהלה אל שרה ויאמר מהרי .</p>\n\n<p>It is to be observed that all of the deeds of the righteous are performed with alacrity. In relation to Abraham it is written (Genesis 18:6), \"And Abraham hastened to the tent, to Sarah, and he said, 'Hasten...'</p>\n\n<p>This is an explanation of the previous verse. So we see that now, Avraham is in Sarah's tent. Perhaps, as a from of continuation, we already know that Avraham was hurrying and running. So, perhaps to state again, \"He ran to the cattle (area)\" wouldn't really be necessary, as you know that he's hurrying. So, the next verse tells you right away the next place that he is going by emphasizing the place first, so it says, \"(Now) to the cattle he ran.\"</p>\n\n<p>Note, also, that as @DoubleAA hinted, that if you were to state the verse according to your suggestion, i.e. - \"Avrham ran to the cattle\", you would need the <em>vav hahipuch</em> format for the 1st verb, which is, currently not there. I.e. the phrasing would be:</p>\n\n<p>וירץ אברהם אל הבקר</p>\n\n<p>You can see that even though the end meaning is the same, there is an important nuance in whether the subject or the place is mentioned first. Compare, in English:</p>\n\n<p>\"I went to Citifield\" vs. \"To Citifield, I went.\" You can see, in each, what's more \"important\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simple answer seems to be that we never say one of the avos \"ran to\" an animal. It would sound very degrading. </p>\n\n\n",

The last one may apply somewhat differently to females and males.

(This question is even more difficult when you realize that in usual shechitah a bird is slaughtered from the front of the neck, but meliqah, a sort of slaughtering done for qorbanos with the kohein‘s nail was done from the back!) Rav concludes that mitzvos only “letzareif bah es habereios — to cleans people with it.”</p>\n\n<p>We do not follow the rules because Hashem cares about the rules themselves. We follow them because they are the Manufacturer's instructions for the proper care and development of the human soul.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a Chazan who praises G-d with the phrase “Your Mercy extends to the bird’s nest”, referring to the mitzvah of shiluach haqen, sending away the mother bird before taking her hatchlings or eggs, is to be deposed from leading the service. The mishnah (Megillah 25a) presents this law, and the gemara gives two explanations:</p>\n\n<p>a- “It arouses jealousy of other animals”.\nb- “Mitzvos are nothing but decrees.”</p>\n\n<p>The implication of the first answer is that G-d doesn’t run all of the world equally, and thus some species have a reason to be jealous of others. It opens room for polytheism or incomplete theism. This is consistent with other items on the list, like the chazzan who says Modim Modim”, saying “Thanks” twice. Which sounds like someone who believes in two gods. (Perhaps out of fear that he picked up some Zoroastrian thought about a demiurge of good and one of evil, as Zoroastrianism was more common among the local non-Jews of the area before the birth of Islam.) </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban (Devarim 22:6) explains the second answer in a manner similar to the conclusion of the medrash. The mitzvah is not an expression of Hashem's compassion. After all, if it were, it would be equally applicable to all of His creatures, not just birds. Rather, it's an exercise He gave us to practice and develop <strong>our</strong> compassion.</p>\n\n<p>G-d doesn't care about all those fiddling rules. He cares about us, and therefore gave us insight into how to shape ourselves to be everything He made us capable of being.</p>\n\n\n",

As we see in the following:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://messiahtruth.yuku.com/topic/4168/Dead-sea-scrolls-and-Psalm-22#.VjVbriunxf0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dead sea scrolls and Psalm 22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Written by Uri Yosef,  Psalms 22 - \"Nailing\" An Alleged Crucifixion\n  Scenario Lesson notes</p>\n  \n  <p>fragments containing Psalms 22:17[16] were discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS).\n  In the first fragment, which was found at\n  Qumran (4QPs-f; known as the Qumran MS, the word in question is not\n  preserved.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the second fragment, found at Nahal Hever (HHev/Se 4 (Ps); known as the Bar Kochba\n  MS, the word is preserved.</p>\n  \n  <p>The fragment HHev/Se 4 (Ps) shows the Hebrew letters (kaf), (aleph), (resh), and what\n  appears to be a somewhat elongated letter\n  (yod), which some perceive to be the letter (vav).[3] Thus, the\n  reading of this word would be either (ka'ari) or (ka'aru),\n  respectively.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although the latter of these two renditions of the term has been the focus of much\n  controversy and discussion, it is a fact that no\n  root verb exists which contains the letter (aleph) in it, conjugated\n  in this fashion (3rd-person, plural masculine gender, past tense),\n  with the meaning of they pierced, as rendered in most Christian\n  translations.</p>\n  \n  <p>Without the letter (aleph), and using, for the moment, the argument that the last letter\n  [the elongated (yod)] is a (vav), the\n  word would be (karu), for which the Hebrew root verb is (karah), [to]\n  dig [in dirt], such as digging a ditch (e.g., Ps 57:7). In other\n  words, (karu) has the meaning [they] dug [in dirt]. This verb is never\n  used in the context of piercing, either literally or metaphorically,\n  in any of its 15 applications in the Hebrew Bible.</p>\n  \n  <p>What could cause such a variation between the two terms (ka'ari) and (ka'aru), i.e.,\n  with an elongated letter (yod) that resembles the\n  letter (vav)? Since the word (ka'aru) does not exist in the Hebrew\n  language, the most plausible explanation is that such discrepancy is\n  simply a case of scribal variation (or error).</p>\n  \n  <p>The word in Psalm 22 is ka'ari (lion) not karu (which means \"to dig\"\n  BTW, as in digging a ditch, not pierce).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Dead Sea Scroll version of the Psalm has kaari, but some Xians\n  think it is kaaru because the yod is longer than normal and can be\n  mistaken for a vav.</p>\n  \n  <p>But here lies the problem: kaaru is NOT a word. There is no such word\n  in Hebrew ancient or modern. Karu is a word -- but that isn't what is\n  in the Dead Sea Scrolls or in any other Hebrew copy of the Psalm.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ka'aru is not a word but karu IS a word. Some Xians try and say that\n  the word in Psalm 22 should be karu. The only problem is that karu\n  doesn't mean \"pierced\" either. It means to dig\". If you use its\n  cognate 3rd person plural masculine gender \"KARU\" it translates to\n  they dug. But note that kara or karu do not us the letter \"aleph\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Kaf-resh-vav is a word. Kaf-ALEPH-resh-vav is not a word. It is as if\n  someone came upon dutg in English and wants to say it is dug.</p>\n  \n  <p>BTW the KJV translates ka'ari correctly in other places that arent\n  proof texts misquoted by the GT.</p>\n  \n  <p>Numbers 23:24 (veka'ari), and I as a young lion</p>\n  \n  <p>Numbers 24:9 (ka'ari), like a lion</p>\n  \n  <p>Isaiah 38:13 (ka'ari), like a lion</p>\n  \n  <p>Ezekiel 22:25 (ka'ari), like a lion</p>\n  \n  <p>So the KJV translators correctly translated it until they got to\n  Psalms 22:17[16] and suddenly the KJV doesn't know what it means and\n  translates it as \"they pierced.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>One more little bit of Hebrew grammar. If the word really was\n  \"pierced,\" (which we've proven it is not) the sentence would have an\n  \"et\" to identify the direct object which would be affected by that\n  verb. There is no et.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you're referring to the Nachal Chever fragment.

See Shir HaShirim for an extended example. The Prophets frequently compared the relationship between Hashem and Israel to the relationship between bridegroom and bride and/or the relationship between husband and wife. For example, regarding the reconciliation of Israel with Hashem, it is written, “As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you” (Isaiah 63:5). And it is also written regarding this reconcilation, “And it shall be on that day, spoke Hashem, that you will call Me, ‘my Husband’ ”(Hosea 2:18). There are many other examples that can be found, but here's my question, although it might be a little far fetched.. </p>\n\n<p>If Bnei Yisrael is compared to a bride, and it is the custom for brides to cover their heads, could the headcovering (for woman, when praying for example) be a symbolic sign of being a bride of HaShem (i.e. being a sign of commitment to HaShem; commitment to a covenent/Torah keeping lifestyle)?</p>\n\n<p>Are there any commentaries regarding to this? </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did the angel overturning Sodom visit Abraham?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone in my synagogue asked today as follows:</p>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> notes (<a href=\"http://chabad.org/8213#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Vayera</em> 18:2</a>, q.v.) that three angels visited <em>Avraham</em>'s tent: one was assigned to inform <em>Sara</em> [of her impending pregnancy], one to overturn <em>S'dom</em>, and one to heal <em>Avraham</em> [after his circumcision] and save <em>Lot</em> from <em>S'dom</em>. He further notes (<a href=\"http://chabad.org/8213#v=33&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">18:33</a>) that the one assigned to inform <em>Sara</em> was not needed afterward, so did not go with the other two angels to <em>S'dom</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why, then, did the one assigned to overturn <em>S'dom</em>, who (seemingly) was not needed at <em>Avraham</em>'s tent, go there?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The final decree on S'dom was not made until they visited Avraham and Sarah. Their behavior sealed the doom of S'dom. Had Avraham not received them as he did, there would have been an argument not to destroy S'dom.</p>\n\n<p>As the OP cited <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi Vayeirah 18:2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One to bring the news [of Isaac’s birth] to Sarah, and one to overturn\n  Sodom, and one to heal Abraham, for one angel does not perform two\n  errands (Gen. Rabbah 50:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is based on the various meforshim on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=17&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:17</a> and <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.21#e0n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:21</a> </p>\n\n<p>Also as Rav Hirsch says in <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.21#e0n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:20-21</a></p>\n\n<p>That the judgement about to be passed on S'dom was held up until the judge Himself had <em>investigated</em> the matter and determined that the behavior was sufficiently egregious as to require complete destruction as a punishment. Part of the <em>investigation</em> was the witnessing (by the mal'ach) of the behavior of Avraham. This showed that there existed an example of proper behavior and an ideal towards which others would have to strive.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, we see that Lot even in S'dom maintained a standard of behavior that could have saved the rest of the city had they learned from it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is an answer that I heard from one of my Rabbeim. It is from the Sefer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Meir_Alter\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Chidushei HaRim</em></a>, on Bereishis 18:9. While he gives the basic pshat mentioned below, he does not quote every source that I have. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ultimately the Davidic dynasty comes from Rus, who, in turn, came from Moav, Lot’s son by his eldest daughter. As Moav was only born after Lot was rescued from Sedom, the only reason Lot was able to be saved was because he would go on to be the ancestor of David HaMelech. (In the words of the Midrash<sup>1</sup>, “‘I have found my servant David.’<sup>2</sup> Where did I find him? In Sedom.”)<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<p>But all would be for naught if Moav’s descendant Rus would be unable to marry Boaz. In order for Lot to be able to father Mashiach, Rus needs to be able to marry into Klal Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>The passuk says,<sup>4</sup> “A Moavite and Amonite may not marry into the populace.” In order that Rus be able to marry Boaz, the exposition<sup>5</sup> “Moavite and not Moavitess; Amonite and not Amonitess” must be valid. But as Doeg challenged,<sup>6</sup> why don’t we make the same exposition of “Egyptian and not Egyptianess”? </p>\n\n<p>To that the Gemara responds<sup>7</sup> based on the following verse. Why may a Moavite and Amonite not enter the populace? “Because they did not greet you with bread and water.”<sup>8</sup> It’s not tznius for women to go out and greet men with food and water. So why did the women not greet the women? The Gemara answers<sup>9</sup> that it’s not tznius for women to be doing that at all. What is its source? Well, one source is from Tehillim 45:14. But the other source it brings is from our very story - “And they said to him, ‘Where is Sarah your wife?’ And he said, ‘She is in the tent.’”<sup>10</sup> As Rashi to that verse explains, the Malachim wanted to know why Sarah wasn’t out with Avraham, and Avraham responded that she is a tzanu’ah. </p>\n\n<p>Why do the Malachim need to know this information?</p>\n\n<p>If Rus can’t marry into the congregation, Lot can’t be saved. The Malach that was to destroy Sedom needed Lot to leave before he could do anything.<sup>11</sup> Therefore, Gavriel needed to know whether he should wait for Lot to leave before overturning the city. But since he could only be saved on account of Rus, he needed to know the answer to the critical question: where is Sarah your wife? Are women tzenu’os, and therefore the women would not greet the women either, or are they not tzenu’os, and therefore Rus is included in the ban on Moavim? With the answer in hand, the Malachim went to Sedom to save Lot before overturning the city. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Bereishis Rabbah 41:4</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>Tehillim 89:21</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup>The Gemara in Yevamos 77a says similarly, comparing “found” in this verse to “found” in Bereishis 19:15 about Lot’s daughters. I only picked the Midrash because it makes the point more explicitly. </p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup>Devarim 23:4</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup>Yevamos 86b</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup>Ibid. </p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup>Ibid.</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup>Devarim 23:5</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup>Yevamos 87a</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup>Bereishis 18:9</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup>See Rashi to Bereishis 19:16, that the Malach in charge of destroying Sedom helped take Lot out of the city. The Gur Aryeh’s second understanding of this Rashi is in line with my point above. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Feinstein raised this point in a shiur of his and answered that we find instances where angels keep to their duty, but utilize some wiggle room, such as Gabriel who had coals he was supposed to destroy Klal Yisroel, but handed them off to an intermediary angel, thereby cooling them off a bit, in order to spare us from destruction. Hashem did not want something like that to happen by Sdom. He wanted the angel to realize how bad they were and destroy them completely, so he had him stop off by Abraham the Tzadik first so he could see the difference. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Doing something bad with a good intention\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently studied the story of Hannah in school. I learned that Penninah would make fun of Hannah for not having children so she could reproach herself and pray deeply to G-d. Penninah was actually doing this with a good intention, believing G-d would see her agony and make her conceive. But Penninah was punished with the death of her children because one can't antagonize somebody even if it's for a good reason.</p>\n\n<p>But I've also learned that the intention counts. I've learned that if you think you're doing a mitzvah for G-d with all your heart and it results you're not doing it well, it still counts (although maybe not in the same level).</p>\n\n<p>This may sound arguable and wrong but I've also discussed with friends some philosophical questions regarding this subject. Like \"If a terrorist really believes he is doing the right thing and he is doing it for G-d, what happens to him in the afterlife? How is he judged?\"</p>\n\n<p>So back to the point, does G-d care about the intention?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>this was posed to <a href=\"http://www.rabbileff.net/shiurim/ask/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Zev Leff</a>, a well known halachic authority in Israel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The suicide bombing Moslems, who do their dastardly deed \"in the name\n  of G-d\", truly believe that what they are doing is right. They feel\n  like they are being mekadesh shem shamayim (Sanctifying G-d's name) by\n  murdering as many Jews as they can while making the ultimate self\n  sacrifice by giving up their lives, and thereby sending themselves\n  straight to Heaven. Does G-d when he judges them, take into\n  consideration the fact that they all seem to be doing what they do\n  leshaim shamayim (In the name of G-d)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>answer: Rabbi Weintraub answers they are not doing it for God's sake they have incentives of all sorts of pleasures they are going to get... see there for more</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rabbileff.net/shiurim/answers/0000-0249/0018.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rabbileff.net/shiurim/answers/0000-0249/0018.mp3</a></p>\n\n<p>as to the general question of whether intention is important, the chovos halevavos discusses this in the intro:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I found in the Torah regarding one who kills someone unintentionally,\n  no capital punishment is incurred. Likewise, one who performs a sin\n  unintentionally which if intentional would incur either capital\n  punishment or the penalty of Karet (excision), the person had only to\n  bring for them a sin-offering or an asham offering. All this is a\n  clear proof that the essential condition of liability for punishment\n  is the association of mind and body in a forbidden act, the mind by\n  its intention, and the body by its movement. So too our wise men said\n  (regarding good deeds): \"whoever performs a religious duty but did not\n  intend to do it for the sake of G-d - he will not receive reward for\n  it.\" And since the hinge and pillar of all deeds rests on the\n  foundation of intention and hidden sentiment of the heart, a system of\n  the duties of the heart should precede, by nature, a system of the\n  duties of the limbs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the talmud also discusses a sin with good intentions regarding Yael. forgot where.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I heard this from Rabbi Eli Mansour:\nPnina was a tzadeket a wife of a tzadik! she was doing this so Hanah would pray with more kavanah and tears, which two conditions known to be accepted by hashem in a prayer faster. That being said, she was punished anyway because out of her good intentions, she secretly came to enjoy it, hence she lost all her children.    So everytime we think we can do something bad with good intentions we should think that hashem rewards midah kneged midah, is it worth it? That's up to each person to answer to hashem!</p>\n\n\n",

I just want to understand what the idea is.  For me, saying the Torah existed before the creation of the world would not be an answer, as it would be an equally crazy and bizarre statement.  I do not mean to offend anyone with my questions.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that there is some kind of understanding of what the Torah is that is unknown to me.  Perhaps that can be explained.  My starting point, for anyone who cares to explain this to me, is that the Torah is a book; a holy book, transcribed by Moses long after the creation of the world.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Tatz says in his book \"Jewish Teenager's Guide to Life\" that God created the world by speaking the words in the Torah. Apparently, the letters and their combinations are a system of spiritual powers God created and can be combined in certain ways to \"create things\". This is the basis of the sefer yetzira. Though one has to be one a very high spiritual level to use it properly.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Talmud (sanhedrin 65b,67b), the Rabbis of the Talmudic era used its system to miraculously create a calf every friday and eat it on the Sabbath.

Therefore, the commandments, or the concept thereof precedes the creation.</p>\n\n<p>Another understanding, which is more common in Kabbalistic circles, is that the Torah as we have it is essentially God's thought as applied to earthly matters. By following and learning the Torah we are training ourselves to think like God.</p>\n\n<p>This God-thought is also a designed, somewhat-finite entity, which is designated as God's working overall plan for the creation. It is thought, which is essentially what Torah is, from which the world was created. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, it is saying that the Torah that we have encompasses the same logic upon which the universe is based.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the haftarah of Vayeira include the miracle of the oil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>haftarah</em> for Vayeira includes two stories about miracles performed by Elisha.  The second one, concerning the Shunamite woman, seems clearly tied to the <em>parsha</em>: a woman is barren; she and her husband provide hospitality to a prophet; the prophet announces she'll have a child; she doubts; she has the child; the child is taken away and then restored.  That would be a great <em>haftarah</em> for this <em>parsha</em> all by itself.</p>\n\n<p>But the <em>haftarah</em> starts with the poor widow who needs to save her children from slavery.  Elisha has her gather vessels from her neighbors and then causes her jar of oil to keep producing oil until she has filled all available containers.  This allows her to sell the oil, redeem her children, and sustain herself.</p>\n\n<p>It's a great story, but why did the rabbis choose to include it here?  Is there some connection to the <em>parsha</em> that I'm not seeing, or was there a more practical concern like (maybe) a desire for it to be longer than it would have been with just the second story?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The mefarshim on this portion of Navi (Targum, Rashi, Radak,  etc.) explain that the man who died was actually Ovadiah (see Melachim Aleph 18). He was the man who kept 100 true prophets alive during their persecution by Jezebel. He hid them in 2 caves. He also provided for all of their physical needs. The cost of secretly supporting them, not only risked Ovadiah's life, but he also had to take a loan at interest to save them.</p>\n\n<p>The Haftarah enters the point of the story where the lender was seeking to take away the widow's children to pay the debt which was caused by supporting the 100 prophets. Ovadiah and his wife knew they were impoverishing themselves in order to save those 100 innocents.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some similarities then, between the Haftarah and Parshas VaYera:</p>\n\n<p>1) There are only a few people mentioned in the Tanach who were called \"G-d fearing\". Abraham was called this in the parsha. Ovadiah was also called \"G-d fearing\" \"very much\". In the Haftarah, he is recognized by that label. That is how the mefarshim know who he is without his name being mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>2) Ovadiah had self sacrifice for the mitzvah to keep guests as Abraham did in the Parsha. He also risked his life to protect them. This reminds us also of the actions of Lot in the Parsha who also risked his life to protect guests.</p>\n\n<p>3) Abraham in the Parsha is called G-d fearing after agreeing to give his son back to Hashem. In the haftarah, Ovadiah risked the life of his two sons by impoverishing himself to save 100 lives. In both cases, Hashem did not wish to let the sons get hurt.</p>\n\n<p>4) In the Parsha, the angels strike the Sodomites with blindness and close Lot's family inside behind the closed door. They ask him: \"Who else do you have in the city?\"</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, In the Haftarah, we have words that remind us of those Parsha verses. The story in the Haftarah has Elisha tell the widow to close the door behind her with her children alone inside (so no one could see the miracle). He also asked her: \"What else do you have in the house?\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How is it that Abraham didn't ask that four save a city, yet four did so?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> (<a href=\"http://chabad.org/8213#showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Vayera</em> 18</a>:24 and passim) explains that <em>S'dom</em> was the most important of five cities in its neighborhood, and God was going to destroy all of them. First, though, He told <em>Avraham</em> of His intent to do so, and <em>Avraham</em> bargained with Him to save one or more of the cities. The conversation went like this (as explained by <em>Rashi</em> and in my very loose translation/paraphrase):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Avraham</em>: Will You destroy the righteous with the wicked? Perhaps there are fifty righteous people in the cities. Will You destroy…?</p>\n<p><em>Hashem</em>: If I find fifty righteous people in the cities, I'll spare the cities for their sake.</p>\n<p><em>Avraham</em>: What if the fifty are lacking five? That's nine per city. You, the Righteous One, can combine with those nine to make ten per city!</p>\n<p><em>Hashem</em>: I won't destroy the cities if I find forty-five there.</p>\n<p><em>Avraham</em>: Maybe forty can be found! Save four cities!</p>\n<p><em>Hashem</em>: For the sake of forty, I'll not destroy four cities.</p>\n<p><em>Avraham</em>: Save three cities for thirty righteous people?</p>\n<p><em>Hashem</em>: Okay.</p>\n<p><em>Avraham</em>: Two for twenty?</p>\n<p><em>Hashem</em>: Okay.</p>\n<p><em>Avraham</em>: One for ten?</p>\n<p><em>Hashem</em>: Okay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that was the end of the conversation. <em>Avraham</em> already knew that <em>Hashem</em> would save one city for the sake of nine righteous people if He would for the sake of ten: after all, <em>Hashem</em> had agreed to add Himself to nine early in the conversation. And there was no point in asking that eight righteous people should save a city because, after all, eight righteous people — <em>Noach</em> and his family — couldn't save the world from the deluge.</p>\n<p>Yet in <a href=\"http://chabad.org/8214#showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">19</a>:18–23, <em>Lot</em> asked that he be allowed to go to a city, and the destroying angel replied that, because of that request, he wouldn't destroy that city. (And indeed only four cities are listed in <em>Nitzavim</em> 29:22 as having been destroyed.)</p>\n<p>But <em>Lot</em> (with his family) was only four people! Was <em>Avraham</em> wrong to stop at ten — he should have bargained for even four righteous people to save a city? If not, how was <em>Lot</em> able to save the city if <em>Avraham</em> couldn't?</p>\n<p>(I know the saved city had fewer sins than the other four, as <em>Rashi</em> explains, but that doesn't explain why <em>Avraham</em> couldn't pray for that less-sinful city in the merit of four righteous people.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/alport/archives/vayera76.htm\">Rav Ozer Alport in his Parsha Potpourri Points to Ponder addresses this issue</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question: How was Lot able to intercede in order to save one of the cities (Tzo'ar) from destruction (19:18-22) when Avrohom, who was even greater and who argued even more on their behalf, was unable to do so? (Yad Yechezkel, Ayeles HaShachar, Derech Sicha)</p>\n  \n  <p>Answer:\n  1) Rav Chatzkel Levenstein answers that as fervently as Avrohom prayed on their behalf, it wasn't possible for him to match the intensity of the prayers of Lot, who personally dwelled in the cities being obliterated and was directly affected by their destruction. He also suggests that the angels were grateful to Lot for hosting them, which obligated them to honor his request, while Hashem had no such debt to Avrohom. Rav Chaim Kanievsky suggests that Avrohom didn't present the argument made by Lot (that Tzo'ar's sins were less than its neighbors), which would have indeed been accepted had he made it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi explains that Avraham learned from the flood that for the sake of 8 people He would not hold back. This didn't change. It remains true. In fact, in normal circumstances, Noach and family would have been swallowed up asking with his generation, which is why he had to be holed up in an ark. We find the Pasuk in Yecheskel referring to Noach, Daniel and Iyov as those few who survived a calamity that happened around them.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham Avinu couldn't separate one city from the other four. The decree was on all of them, and for good reason. His campaign was based on the apparent unjust aspect of having the righteous amongst the Sedomites getting caught up in the punishment. His request was to refrain from punishing at all for the sake of those righteous few. But the fact that one city had less sins was not a reason, even from the viewpoint of this world, not to include it. </p>\n\n<p>Lot, upon necessity was able to cash in on the difference, while requesting to save himself that way. There was indeed enough of a difference between Tzoar and the other four cities to exclude it because of technical issues. Lot had access to this technical issue, Avraham did not.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it seemed to me that Lot did this purposely to save that city. We see that he left there right away.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Avraham and lot were making two totally different arguments. Avraham was basing his argument on merit vs sin. There wasn't enough merit so the cities couldn't be saved. Lot was saying i am weak and can't walk so far, can't you let me go there. He wasn't asking for justice but for mercy. The addition of Zoar being younger was just something to which to \"hang\" the mercy on. Similar to how in tachanun we don't list our merits and say well if so you should forgive me, rather we say our sins and ask forgiveness. </p>\n\n\n",

Rabi was born frum\n  but went off, and in his autobiography he tells a story in which he\n  relates why he went off the derech. He writes that when he was 10\n  years old he was told that if someone looks at the kohanim during\n  duchening, they will go blind. He wanted to test this out to see if it\n  was true, but didn’t want to lose his eyesight in both eyes, so he\n  took a peek through one of them. When nothing happened, he opened his\n  other eye, and when he saw that what he had been taught was indeed\n  untrue, he decided to leave yiddishkeit. That was Rabi’s story.\n  Penzias, on the other hand, I have heard, is a ba’al teshuva.

First for those in Western Europe, but the development does reach Eastern Europe over the course of the next several decades. Until then, for most people Jewish observance and belief were not subject to conscious decision. This is the lifestyle of the Jew. Each area really only had one, they didn't differ all that much.</p>\n<p>Then the Enlightenment gave Jews a choice. People needed a reason to stick to Judaism. An ideal to aspire to. And that led to the rise of movements. Some movements, like German Reform, responded to the new opportunity by not insisting on those qualities of Judaism we call Orthodoxy. Chassidus was a different kind of early response; to give the people in the field that ideal, a way of being passionate about one's Judaism that would make it more appealing than the newly offered other choice -- assimilation. (In fact, it was not 100% clear in the 2nd generation which way Chassidus would end up going. The Tzemach Tzedeq, the 3rd Lubavitch Rebbe, allegedly credited the Vilna Gaon and the Misnagdic opposition to weeding out the more avant-garde and antinomian splinters of the Chassidic movement.)</p>\n<p>In Hungary, the Chasam Sofer's response was a counter-reaction, with the slogan \"<em>Chadash assur min haTorah</em> -- the new is prohibited by the Torah\".</p>\n<p>And similarly, Germany produced two very different forms of Neo-Orthodoxy -- one by R' SR Hirsch, the other based in Berlin. They did not mingle socially, and were in fact recognized by the Prussian Government as members of separate religions. (The Berlin form being unified with the non-O Jews, whereas Rav Hirsch's community \"walked out\", forming the Austritt community.)</p>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon's tradition evolved into the Yeshiva and Mussar Movements.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the more modern elements of East European Jewry embraced the new wisdom calling itself the Haskalah (Enlightenment, in Hebrew) and studied Judaism from a more academic and scientific perspective. In their hopes to modernize the community as a whole, they ended up undermining the more traditional movements. America developed its own version of Reform. Back in Europe, Neolog gained ground.</p>\n<p>Then we had Conservative, Modern Orthodoxy, Religious Zionism, the American and Israeli Yeshiva Movements (trying to recreate the Lithuanian original, but not quite ideologically identical), the rebuilding of post-War Chassidus, etc...</p>\n<p>All this went on among Ashkenazim. There was no similar culture shock in the rest of the Jewish world, so there was no similar rise of Isms. But when Ashkenazi, Sepharadic, Ottoman and Yemenite Jewish communities met, primarily in Israel, those other communities saw Orthodoxy as having the nearest equivalent of their One Jewish Lifestyle version of Judaism. And so the Chakham Baqshi, the Chief Rabbi of Palestine under the Ottoman Empire, worked together with the Orthodox rabbinate, not the other movements. Orthodoxy isn't a property these Ashkenazi movements mutually created, it is a property they preserved.</p>\n<p>So, Orthodoxy is less a movement as a set of movements, or at least the property they all share in common. Unlike Reform or Conservative Judaism, there is no defining group of ordination schools, that we can define \"Orthodox ordination\" by listing a handful of institutions, no synagogue umbrella, and most definitely O synagogues don't belong to any umbrella.</p>\n<p>That property, Orthodoxy, admittedly has yet to be addressed. To segue into that... The American Conservative movement is a good example to use for illustration. JTS, now JTSA, the Conservative rabbinical academy, was founded by the same people who had started the Orthodox Union. After the Great Depression, when charity money was at a premium, there was even discussion of a merger between Yeshiva College (now: Yeshiva University) and JTS. But now, no one would consider JTS and Conservative Judaism as an Orthodox Movement.</p>\n<p>What changed? Three things really:</p>\n<p>1- The negotiations with YU fell apart largely over a single person -- Mordechai Kaplan, who later leaves Conservative to found Reconstructionism. His philosophy was just too heretical (by Orthodox standards) to be acceptable in a religious teacher in an Orthodox institution.</p>\n<p>2- The driving responsum, allowing people who couldn't otherwise reach services to drive to them on Shabbos, was a leniency that the Orthodox halachic process couldn't countenance.</p>\n<p>Conservative developed from the Breslau Historical School (many of whom were considered Orthodox) who saw the sages of the Mishnah and the Talmuds in their historical context, and thought that this kind of analysis is important to understanding the <em>halakhah</em>. And once one accepts that <em>halakhah</em> has always been malleable enough to be used by the rabbinate for what they considered noble social and political ends, it is natural for contemporary rabbis to do the same.</p>\n<p>3- It became the norm in JTS to teach Document Hypothesis, the idea that the Torah was revealed piecemeal over the course of generations, rather than a literal revaluation to Moshe in the Sinai desert. (With a possible exception of the last few verses and other nits one can pick.)</p>\n<p>Whereas within Orthodoxy, acceptable beliefs are presumed to be explicable in some way as loosely conforming to the 13 Articles of Faith. Likely not the Rambam's original, but somehow affirming the versions in the siddur -- Ani Maamin and Yigdal.</p>\n<p>In other words. they disagreed on Who, What and Why.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, within Orthodoxy, Rav Moshe Feinstein, Rav Menashe Klein, an Rav Ovadia Yosef (e.g.) came from very different communities, had significantly different worldviews, and also disagreed on practical rulings. But they agreed on certain basics of the faith, and enough about the process of how to come up with a ruling, to mutually acknowledge and respect each other's positions as valid.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have used the word \"Orthodox\" and \"Observant\" in my questions, so perhaps I can answer, but I can only speak for myself, not anyone else on the site or for the site.  You should note 1) I just started participating on this site and 2) I am not Orthodox or observant which, from what I can tell, would put me in a very small minority of people using this site and probably means my perspective, my questions and how I frame them are very unrepresentative of the beliefs and frame of mind of people who use this site.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, my use of the term \"Orthodox\" is in the sense of Jews who believe the precepts of traditional Rabbinic Judaism and live or attempt to live accordingly. I also mean to include Hasidim in this. It is meant in contrast to Jews who identify as Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist, or simply as culturally or ethnically Jewish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It turns out that your question is actually a bit more complicated than you might have expected.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout history, Jews have always been divided among various groups. In the early- to mid-19th century, the Reform and Conservative Movements of Judaism formed. Without going too deeply into the details of those movements, they were (and are) more liberal movements within Judaism with respect to the extent to which they considered themselves bound by the <em>halachic</em> (Jewish law) rulings of the past. Orthodox Judaism, in contrast, is a movement within Judaism that considers Jews to be completely bound by an unchanging (more or less) <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason your question is difficult to answer, though, is because unlike Reform and Conservative Judaism, Orthodox Judaism does not have a monolithic structure. While the Reform and Conservative Movements have official organizational structures and policies determining who is \"in\" and who is \"out,\" the \"Orthodox Movement\" does not have any central governing body. Since there is no official organization which runs the \"Orthodox Movement,\" there is no universal agreement on what specific beliefs and practices are sufficient to be considered Orthodox. </p>\n\n<p>On this site (and this is also my practice in real life) we define Orthodox Jews basically as those who self-identify as believing that <em>halacha</em> is binding upon all Jews and cannot be abrogated. Orthodox Judaism is subdivided into many small groups, and there is considerable debate about which of those groups can really appropriately be called Orthodox and which of them do not really match the title; however, the differences between these groups usually does not revolve around <em>whether halacha is binding</em>, but rather <em>what the halacha is</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal opinion, anybody who believes that <em>halacha</em> is binding upon all Jews can accurately be called Orthodox. If they legitimately believe that the <em>correct</em> interpretation of <em>halacha</em> is different from what mainstream Orthodoxy believes is the correct interpretation of <em>halacha</em>, I would not revoke their Orthodox status.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps the change in status is the source of the Torah prohibition which would not apply logically to the married woman's daughter?</p>\n\n<p>3) If this Kal V'chomer were true, then the original \"permitted wife\" in the formula was not in fact permitted (since she herself is some married woman's daughter).

    "content": "# Did Abraham know that Lot survived the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In last week's Parasha, we all know the story of Abraham arguing with God to have God spare the cities on account of the righteous. However, I haven't heard much about the end of the story.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genesis Chapter 19</p>\n  \n  <p>24 Then the LORD caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone\n  and fire from the LORD out of heaven;... 27 And Abraham got up\n  early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD.\n  28 And he looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the\n  land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up\n  as the smoke of a furnace. 29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed\n  the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out\n  of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which\n  Lot dwelt. 30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain,\n  and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he\n  dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. ... 36 Thus were both the\n  daughters of Lot with child by their father. 37 And the first-born\n  bore a son, and called his name Moab--the same is the father of the\n  Moabites unto this day. 38 And the younger, she also bore a son, and\n  called his name Ben-ammi--the same is the father of the children of\n  Ammon unto this day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way i interpret this story, Abraham awakes the next morning and witnesses the destruction of the cities, and must therefore conclude that Lot is dead. The story picks up with Lot hiding in a cave, and stuff happening that discusses the heritage of certain peoples, but it never answers the questions as to whether or not he ever leaves the cave, or if he ever reunites with Abraham.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are: Did Abraham think Lot died with Sodom and Gomorrah, and did he ever find out Lot was alive after the fact?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Rashi on Genesis 20:1:1:</p>\n\n<p><b>ויסע משם אברהם.</b> (excerpt)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>להתרחק מלוט שיצא עליו שם רע שבא על בנותיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation (and context):</p>\n\n<p>The parsha (paragraph) following the story of Lot mentions that Avraham travelled to Grar. Almost every commentary asks why Avraham did this, as there was nothing wrong living in Elonei Mamre and there was no famine or other crisis forcing him to move. Rash\"i is commenting on why Avraham moved, and one of his reasons is:</p>\n\n<p>\"To distance himself from Lot, as a bad reputation came upon him (Lot) since he had relations with his daughters.\"</p>\n\n<p>If you follow the sequence of events, this story with Lot occurred in the cave after Lot left Tzo'ar. So, according to this explanation, Avraham had to have known that Lot was saved from Sodom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Maimonides (The Guide of the Perplexed II.42; as explained, I believe, by Rabbi Dr. Menachem Krakowski) maintains that the passage is describing the events as they were prophetically witnessed by Abraham, meaning he was aware of the entire sequence of events.</p>\n\n\n",

They are not \"chattering\". They are helping the community by selling necessary goods to them.

    "title": "What's this about a magical spitting bird?",
    "content": "# What's this about a magical spitting bird?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Christopher Hitchens's memoir <em>Hitch 22</em>, this passage caught my eye:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In her preface to his collection of essays <em>The Non-Jewish Jew</em> Tamara Deutscher, widow of the great Isaac, relates the story of how her husband, future biographer of Leon Trotsky, studied for his bar mitzvah.[6] Considered the brightest boy in any yeshivah for years gone by or for miles around, he was set to speak to the following question: somewhere in the looped intestines of Jewish lore there is mention of a miraculous bird which visits the world only at intervals of several decades and then only very briefly. On its periodic landings it delivers and leaves behind a beakful of bird-spit. This avian drool, if you can seize hold of even a drop of it, has wonder-working properties. Now comes the crucial question (surely you saw it coming?): Is the bird-spit to be reckoned as kosher or as treyfe? The boy Isaac spoke for several hours on the rival theories of this dispute, and on the competing commentaries on those rival theories, and of course on the commentaries on those commentaries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This bird appears to be known as the \"kikiyon\"<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wx1oM6FXs-4C&pg=PA236&dq=kikiyon#v=onepage&q=kikiyon&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, which quotes a claim that the Deutscher passage is conflating the term referring to a West African crypted with קיקיון, a plant which appears in the book of Jonah.</p>\n<p>Now I've been unable to get my hands on a copy of <em>The Non-Jewish Jew</em>, and googling \"magical bird+Judaism\" hasn't gotten me anywhere.  What exactly is this bird, what sources do we have for it, and is its spit kosher? (Or is this passage inaccurate about the magical spitting bird's existence?)</p>\n<p>EDIT: I did manage to get my hands on <em>The Non-Jewish Jew</em>, and here is the passage which started it all:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dressed in a new kapota of pure silk made especially for the occasion, little Iciu—as he was affectionately called' stood straight, collected his thoughts' and started on a two hour discourse on the theme of Kikiyon:</p>\n<p>Once in seventy years a bird appears over the world. The bird is big and beautiful and unlike all other birds. Its name is Kikiyon. This curious name, probably Greek in origin,\nhas never been explained. When the bird makes its flight once in seventy years-it spits on the earth, and it spits only once. This saliva is extremely precious; it has miraculous\nqualities, for it can cure any illness or deformity. What Isaac had to debate and give his most considered opinion on was this: Is the bird's saliva kosher or treyfe? In other words,.\ndoes it fulfil the requirements of the Jewish ritual with regard to food or not? Isaac quoted at length all that had been written on the subject before-all the commentaries, all the learned discussions that had been going on for millennia among the wisest of the wise. He showed command of his sources and a capacity to deal with the most abstruse details. His audience sat enthralled and in complete silence.They nodded their heads admiringly. Then, after a short consultation, they pronounced him, inevitably, fit and worthy to become a rabbi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>This is an example of how a little information can generate a great deal of confusion. It appears to be the blending of several different elements from the Torah into a single story.</p>\n\n<p>As Wasserstein states in the article you  linked to, the \"kikayon\" (קיקיון) is not a bird at all. Rather, it is a desert plant that is mentioned in the book of Yonah, chapter 4. It is most likely related to a type of agave plant which is also commonly called the century plant. That is because depending upon the amount of light and heat it is exposed to this plant blooms once in every 70 to 100 years. When it reaches the stage of blossoming it grows a single thick stalk much like a tree trunk. This is like the tree that sprouted overnight in the book of Yonah to provide him shade from the sun during the day. It has been reported that at this blooming stage the stalk can grow at an incredible rate of 6 inches to a foot per day. And then it blossoms and the stalk dies very rapidly. Here are a few links for examples:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.discoverseaz.com/Wildlife/AgaveBlooms.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.discoverseaz.com/Wildlife/AgaveBlooms.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://thetandd.com/news/local/blooming-century-plant-turning-heads-in-town/article_50016424-ef5c-11e2-bc5b-0019bb2963f4.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://thetandd.com/news/local/blooming-century-plant-turning-heads-in-town/article_50016424-ef5c-11e2-bc5b-0019bb2963f4.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3186076/American-agave-blooms-Britain-height-35ft.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3186076/American-agave-blooms-Britain-height-35ft.html</a></p>\n\n<p>This plant produces a kind of oil or sap that is sweet, like agave syrup. It has also been highly prized for its medicinal properties. See the following link.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cloverleaffarmherbs.com/agave/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.cloverleaffarmherbs.com/agave/</a></p>\n\n<p>It is worth pointing out that during biblical times, sweet seasonings were quite prized and valued commodities throughout the ancient world. So if there was a native agave to Israel it would have been highly prized as an export item.</p>\n\n<p>This is mentioned because there is another desert plant, that was native to Israel and was known for its oil that was essentially made extinct by the Romans when they attempted to remove it from Israel and introduce it to Italy. That is the \"Afarsimon Tree\". Today many speculate based upon linguistics that it may have been some kind of persimmon. Persimmon sounds like \"Afarsimon\". In fact, the Japanese variety of persimmon is called \"Kaki\" which sounds like \"Kikayon\". Keep in mind that according to Midrash, at the end of his life Avraham sent his children born from Keturah to the lands of the east with gifts. Those gifts or at least language elements could have included this \"Kaki\". But persimmon trees grow very slowly, requires a decent amount of water, a more temperate climate and would not do well in a desert climate. The Afarsimon Tree was native to Israel in particular around Ein Gedi, an extremely arid area near the Dead Sea.</p>\n\n<p>The Afarsimon Tree was also used in the making of perfumes and was part of the holy anointing oil. See the following link for details.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishmag.com/54mag/ein-gedi/ein-gedi.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.jewishmag.com/54mag/ein-gedi/ein-gedi.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>\"Afarsimon\" can also be translated as \"Oil from the Dust\" which alludes to it being native to desert conditions.</p>\n\n<p>This oil that comes from the \"Kikayon\" is also referred to in Mishna Shabbat, chapter 2, mishnah 1 as \"Shemen Kik\", oil of kik. It is also discussed in the Talmud on the same Mishna, Shabbat 21a which refers to the oil as \"Kik d'Yonah\". And this would introduce the mistranslation by the young Isaac Deutcher.</p>\n\n<p>\"Kik d'Yonah\" which actually means \"the oil of Yonah\", the oil of the kikayon mentioned in the book of Jonah, can be mis-read \"Oil of the Dove\". \"Yonah\" means dove. And this \"oil\" or mucus (called \"ki'ach\") or saliva (called \"rok\"), would be the source of his confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Once set upon the mythical bird element from the mistranslation, it would be easy to look at the special birds mentioned in Torah. There are essentially two.</p>\n\n<p>The first is the \"Bird of the Field\" (זיז שדי) mentioned in many places within the Torah. Here are a few citations:\nTehillim 50:11, Bava Batra 73b, Yalkut Shimoni Bereshit 27, Yalkut Shimoni Pinchas 776, Yalkut Shimoni Shmuel 94, Yalkut Shimoni Iyov 926, and Yalkut Shimoni Esther 1054.</p>\n\n<p>This \"Ziz Sadai\" is the paradigm or archetype for all birds and is discussed extensively in both Midrash and kabbalistic literature. It is associated with the famous Moshiach's seudah for the righteous destined to take place literally in the future. So the concept of whether this bird is kosher would be relevant.</p>\n\n<p>This feast will also include Leviathan (paradigm for fish), Shor HaBor (paradigm for domesticated animals) and the ancient wine stored away from the beginning of the creation.</p>\n\n<p>These three creatures comprise three different types of flesh, white, red and pink. This corresponds to the kabbalistic concept of the three general paths within Torah found in all of creation, namely the two extremes of \"Chesed\" (kindness), and \"Gevurah\" (strength or overpowering as in domination), and the intermediate, \"Rachamim or Tiferet\" (mercy or beauty). According to the Midrash, the Ziz Sadai has eternal life and is mentioned as being \"tahor\", meaning fit for kosher consumption.</p>\n\n<p>The second mythical bird mentioned in the Torah is what in English is referred to as the Phoenix. In Hebrew it is called the \"Chol\" (חול). It is also called the \"Avarashna\" (אוורשנא) in Aramaic. A few citations are:</p>\n\n<p>Iyov 29:18, Sanhedrin 108a, Bereshit Rabbah 19, Yalkut Shimoni Iyov 915, and Midrash Shmuel 12.</p>\n\n<p>This bird lives for 1000 years and the offspring arises from ashes or carcass of the expired parent. This is also discussed extensively in both midrashic and kabbalistic literature.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can olives infected with worms from the olive fly be used for making olive oil\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Here, in Portugal they produce olive oil from olives that contain worms (from the olive fly). In our harvest we see an infection that is above the 80%. We spoke with locals in the area and they told us that it is very normal and gives no problems for the oil.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that Torah prohibits the eating of worms and as a result prohibits the use of olive oil which is made out of olives which are affected with worms.</p>\n\n<p>Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>We want to make kosher oil. How can we do this and how do they solve this in other countries like Italy and Israël?</p>\n\n<p>Don't they have the same problem? Can someone help me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When the oil is made, the worms are also crushed so there is a bitul of their bodies and you only have to deal with their taste. The Shulhan Aroukh in Yore Dea siman 103 says that they give a <em>taam pagoum</em> and the Rama agrees with him in siman 107 but the Shah' is <em>mah'mir</em>. Whatever in the case of the oil, there is easily 60 times more oil than the worms. There is also no issue of <em>mevatel issur lekhateh'ila</em> since it's a non-Jew who does it and there is no intention to crush in order to allow the worms. \nOf course this is my opinion and I'm not possek.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is probably only slightly relevant (& hopefully not intrusive) however.. when pressing the olives later in the season you notice some fruit is much riper & falls easily when much of the fruit is hard and unripe..this dark fruit is usually the more infected fruit.also..upon questioning an associate who does chemical testing for acid content in olives he informed me that he's never detected any residual flesh in any amount in oil that was \"soft\" separated (meaning pressed as usual but left for several weeks to allow the water content to settle) when the first millimeter of oil (the line where separation begins) was discarded with the water..not even on the microscopic level.. the only differences he could associate with these fly larvae was an increase in the oils acidity that is roughly 4% higher than  uninfested olives.. I'm not of any particular faith so i don't know the details of your concern (weather its the flesh or the killing or both)  or if you can even accept advice from someone who is not thoroughly familiar with the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>These fruit flies come from the fruit .breed and inject the dart (egg) into the fruit & never leave the tree if fruit is on or under it. be sure all fruit is cleaned from your trees & around them each season & bury any unused fruit 4\" deep This reduces populations. </p>\n\n\n",

In modern English academic literature about ancient Israel and Judah, the pre-exilic Southern kingdom is referred to as \"Judah.\" During the Persian period, when we talk about the place to which the Jewish communities returned (think Ezra and Nehemiah), we call this geographical entity \"Yehud.\" And finally, during the Hellenistic period on (I don't know when this changes in late antique scholarship), we refer to the land as \"Judea.\" </p>\n\n<p>In this particular case, since the author is discussing the Persian period, he follows the common convention and refers to \"Yehud\" as the place in which the golah and <em>ʕam hāʔāreṣ</em> live.</p>\n\n\n",

Doesn't lend itself as naturally to \"sharing\" review.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3) Let your chavrusa read everything always</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>advantage: Makes your chavrusa happy.

In such cases, they may alternate these roles, as well. Sometimes, one is more competent in Gemarah but, perhaps can't read Rash\"i script.

It's not tied to the land but rather to covenant.</p>\n<p>Rambam, Kings and their Wars, 10:7-8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המילה--נצטווה בה אברהם וזרעו בלבד, שנאמר \"אתה וזרעך אחריך, לדורותם\"\n(בראשית יז,ט).  יצא זרעו של ישמעאל, שנאמר \"כי ביצחק, ייקרא לך זרע\"\n(בראשית כא,יב).  ויצא עשיו, שהרי יצחק אמר ליעקוב \"וייתן לך את ברכת\nאברהם, לך ולזרעך\" (בראשית כח,ד)--מכלל שהוא לבדו זרעו של אברהם המחזיק\nבדתו ודרכו הישרה, והם המחוייבין במילה.</p>\n<p>אמרו חכמים שבני קטורה, שהם זרעו של אברהם שבאו אחר ישמעאל\nויצחק--חייבין במילה.  והואיל ונתערבו היום בני ישמעאל בבני קטורה,\nיתחייבו הכול במילה בשמיני; ואין נהרגין עליה.</p>\n<p>Only Abraham and his descendants were commanded regarding circumcision\nas Genesis 17:9-10 states: 'Keep My covenant, you and your\noffspring... circumcise every male.' The descendants of Ishmael are\nexcluded as implied by Genesis 21:12: 'It is through Isaac, that your\noffspring will be called.' Esau's descendants are also excluded, for\nIsaac told Jacob Genesis 28:4: 'May God grant Abraham's blessing to\nyou and your descendants,' implying that only he is the true offspring\nof Abraham who maintains his faith and his upright behavior. Thus,\nthey alone are obligated in circumcision.</p>\n<p>Our Sages related that the descendants of Keturah who are the\noffspring of Abraham that came after Isaac and Ishmael are also\nobligated in circumcision. Since, at present, the descendants of\nIshmael have become intermingled with the descendants of Keturah, they are all obligated to be circumcised on the eighth day. However, they are not executed for failure to perform this mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though Islam practices circumcision, technically only those that descend from Ishmael/Keturah are required to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To paraphrase <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-vilna-gaon-part-3-review-of-eliyahu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article on the seforimblog</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Raphael Shuchat notes that in a manuscript version of the Aderet Eliyahu text there is an important addition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפילו הגוים הדרים בא\"י צריכים לקיים כל המצוות, לפי שכל המצוות תלויים בארץ ישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But even with this addition the text is still very difficult, and no one has been able to find a source for the notion that Gentiles have to observe all the mitzvot in the Land of Israel, meaning that the idea is probably original to the Gaon. </p>\n\n<p>R. Eliezer Waldenberg also takes note of the passage in Aderet Eliyahu, and seeing no way to explain it assumes that the text is a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Yet R. Waldenberg was unaware that in Aderet Eliyahu, Deut. 1:5, the Gaon says the exact same thing, namely, that in the Land of Israel non-Jews are obligated in all the mitzvot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן נענשו אפי' נכרים מפני שלא שמרו את התורה בארץ כמ\"ש (מ\"ב י\"ז) לא ידעו את משפט א-להי הארץ, שישראל מצווה על כל התורה בח\"ל ובארץ מצווה אפי' נכרי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This text appears in full even in the second edition of Aderet Eliyahu, which is the edition that censored the comment to Deut. 32:9. R. Elijah Dessler used the censored Aderet Eliyahu so he didn’t know the Gaon’s comment to Deut. 32:9, but he noted the comment to Deut. 1:5 and expressed his great surprise.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה דבר פלא לאמר דע\"פ דין תורה כל נכרי הדר בא\"י יהי' מחוייב בכל המצוות כל זמן שבחפצו לדור בה, ותו מה יהי' בדבר שמירת שבת, שהרי הגוי אסור בשמירתה, ומה יהי' באכילת קרבן פסח, וכדומה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While I don’t know of any talmudic or midrashic sources to support the Gaon’s position that a non-Jew in the Land of Israel has to observe all mitzvot,. there are some earlier texts that place additional obligations on non-Jews than what we normally assume.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra, Ex. 13:7, 20:8, Lev. 17:13-14, 20:25, states that a non-Jew living in the Land of Israel (i.e., a ger toshav) is obligated to observe Shabbat. He is also not to work on Yom Kippur, to refrain from eating hametz on Passover, and to only eat kosher food. This is Ibn Ezra's understanding of the peshat of the Torah, but the Talmud records no such laws.</p>\n\n<p>The most significant of the sources I can cite, and the one closest to the Gaon's position, is found in Avodah Zarah 64b. Here the Talmud quotes אחרים as saying that a ger toshav has to observe all the mitzvot with the exception of ritually slaughtered meat. The Hazon Ish, Yoreh Deah 65:6 wonders about this position, since does it mean that a non-Jew must wear tefillin and eat in a sukkah? He assumes that the talmudic passage means that non-Jews in the Land of Israel are only obligated in the negative commandments, and this is required so that Jews not be negatively influenced by their non-Jewish neighbors. See also R. Asher Weiss, Minhat Asher, Bereishit, p. 19.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, R. Elijah Gaon was of the opinion that gentiles living in Osrael must keep all the commandments, which would presumably include circumcision as well, but this is a minority view.</p>\n\n\n",

The water does not always take the identity of the vegetable itself, and in some cases the Berachah on the water would remain a Shehakol. Rosh explains that the water will only acquire a new Berachah-identity if, and only if, one is cooking the soup in order to eat the vegetables also. It is then that the water can be viewed as being one with the vegetables and allow it to be viewed as having become part of the “greater soup”. It is in such a case that the Berachah will be the same as the vegetable itself. However, if one is only cooking the vegetable so that the water should be infused with its taste, and not because he also wants to eat the vegetables, then he would only recite a Shehakol on the water as the water retains its own identity, albeit with a better taste; it’s just a cup of flavored water.</p>\n  \n  <p>Perach Mateh Aharon[14] writes that it is based on the reasoning of\n  the Rosh that we recite a Shehakol on coffee, tea and even beer\n  because the tea leaves are not being eaten, the coffee grinds are\n  definitely going to be thrown out and nary a hop will ever be found in\n  a bottle of beer. The whole intention of the cooking process in solely\n  for the resultant drink and not for the tea leaves, beans and hops at\n  all. So while it is true that the tea leaf and the coffee bean and the\n  hops are boiled in the water, and it is true that from the simple\n  understanding of the Gemarah the water should have required an\n  upgraded berachah. However, when you apply the Rosh’s qualification of\n  this Halachah it allows for, and even encourages, the general custom\n  to recite a Shehakol on a nice steaming cup of a morning Starbucks\n  coffee[15](see footnote) as one is only focused on the drink itself\n  and not anything else. On the other hand, the Panim Meiros counters\n  that tea and coffee are in a different class when it comes to this\n  Halachah. Tea leaves and coffee are planted, cultivated, roasted and\n  ground in order to produce this drink. This is the end result and the\n  bottom line for the tea and coffee; it was produced for just this\n  purpose and is only edible in this state. So, of course the water in\n  which the coffee/tea was boiled will take on a greater significance\n  than just being flavored water, whereupon it will take upon itself the\n  berachah of the tea leaf or the coffee bean, as this is what they were\n  grown for.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Panim Meiros has put forth a seemingly strong halachic argument\n  and brought many proofs to support his case[16]. However, he ends off\n  his responsa by stating that the beracha on coffee and tea still\n  remains a Shehakol as this has been the minhag of the Jews for as long\n  as he can remember and the minhag is not going to change, therefore,\n  he too only recited a Shehakol on coffee and tea. In addition, many of\n  the gedolim of his era, such as the Beis Meir[17], and the Shvus\n  Yaakov[18]differed with the Panim Meiros’ understanding of the Rosh\n  and were of the opinion that the correct berachah on these beverages\n  are a Shehakol.</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"13\">\n  <li>Shaalos U’Teshuvos HaRosh Klal 4, siman 15.

It's hard for us to grasp how much purity mattered to Jews/Israelites in times of yore since we no longer have a temple.

Most of that information has been lost. But we do know that people were doing it, and for lots of different reasons. From a historical perspective, it would be a fair statement to say that out of all the others doing immersion during that time, John was probably the most popular, and also why the New Testament probably mentions him so much. If John was famous in that contemporary time, to write and say that he was on your religious side would be a good advantage for spreading your message.</p>\n\n\n",

And I wasn't ready, so I stumbled through prayers I didn't comprehend, that took me forever because I was learning the language, and it was frustrating.  My rabbi advised me to back off; doing less, but doing it consistently, was more important than doing everything, getting frustrated, and then not doing it because of that.  I did that, and over time my ability increased.</p>\n\n<p>As women we have <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/11888/472\">fewer prayer obligations</a> than men.  Use that.  Start with the subset that is obligatory and try to form a habit with <em>that</em>.  You can expand later.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like you are praying on your own rather than in a minyan.  It's important to make a fixed time for your prayer; if you say \"I'll do it later, after I do this other thing\", time can get away from you and then you won't have done it at all.  Somewhere in Tractate B'rachot the g'mara says that if you're not praying with the community (minyan) you should nonetheless pray at the same time as the community service.  If that time works for you, do that -- both for the reasons in the g'mara and to force a fixed time.  In addition, as DoubleAA notes in a comment, if you pay careful attention to the rules about not eating/working before praying, that can serve as both a reminder and an incentive.  (For <em>halacha</em> about <em>mincha</em> and <em>ma'ariv</em>, see ShA OC 232 and 235.  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/22830/472\">This answer</a> cites Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Ch 8 concerning <em>shacharit</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>90% of prayer is consistent repetition.

    "content": "# When exactly was Eve named?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While reading <em>Paradise Lost</em>, I noticed that at some point in the text <em>before</em> the forbidden fruit is consumed, Adam refers to Eve by name. This bothered me: I read the beginning of Genesis a couple weeks ago and remembered that in the text, the naming of Eve is not recounted until <em>after</em> we are told of the consumption of the fruit and God's response (3:20).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(That it is Adam who comes up with a name makes sense to me, per 2:19-20.)</p>\n\n<p>It's always possible that the text doesn't describe events in a chronological progression---e.g. I certainly wouldn't interpret the events of Genesis 2 as occurring after those of Genesis 1. However, this does not appear to be the case here: the mention of Eve's naming is wedged between God's curses and a verse that states that \"garments of skin\" were created for the man and woman. The latter two events must occur after the fruit is consumed, and it would be odd then for a single line between them to take place outside of the time-frame they cover.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, my interpretation has generally been that Eve wasn't named until after the forbidden fruit was consumed. This raises two problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Am I correct about this interpretation? (If not, is there a reference I could consult?)</p></li>\n<li><p>If I am indeed correct, why <em>wasn't</em> Eve named earlier? After all, the reason for her name---that she is \"the mother of all living\"---doesn't seem contingent on the fruit having been consumed. (Or is it? Perhaps I'm just lacking additional context.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p><em>Malbim</em> explains that Adam had been calling her \"woman\" because of her role as his helpmeet.

She'd been called <em>Chaya</em> as the mother of all life.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"//www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.3.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Radak</em></a> says Adam named Eve after the sin because only then (on acquiring the desire for marital relations) did Adam realize that they would have children and that she would, therefore, be the mother of all the living.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#v=20&showrashi=true\">says</a> that the name occurred earlier and we're just being told this later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>And the man named:</strong> Scripture returns to its previous topic (2:20): “And the man named,” and it interrupted only to teach you that through the giving of names, Eve was mated to him, as it is written (above 2:20): “but for man, he did not find a helpmate opposite him.” Therefore, (ibid. 21): “And He caused a deep sleep to fall,” and since Scripture wrote, (ibid. 25):“And they were naked,” it juxtaposed the section of the serpent, to let you know that because he saw her naked and saw them engaging in intercourse, he desired her and came upon them with a design and with guile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In 2:23 Adam called the woman <em>ishah</em>, naming the \"category\" but not the individual as he had done for the animals.  Rashi says that he also named <em>this</em> <em>ishah</em> \"Chava\" at that time, but the torah delayed telling us.</p>\n\n<p>Why?  The torah intersperses the episode with the snake to connect their unashamed nakedness (2:25) with his (the snake's) own jealousy over seeing them naked.  <em>Adam and Chava</em> were not bothered by their nakedness, but the <em>snake</em> was.  And the torah wraps the snake episode in the \"bookends\" of naming so that we can learn this.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that Rashi bases this on B'reishit Rabbah 18:6 (Soncino translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>AND THEY WERE NOT ASHAMED. NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE SUBTLE, etc. Now surely Scripture should have stated, And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin (Gen. III, 21) [immediately after the former verse]? Said R. Joshua b. Karhah: It teaches you through what sin that wicked creature inveigled them, viz. because he saw them engaged in their natural functions, he [the serpent] conceived a passion for her. R. Jacob of Kefar Hanan said: It is thus written in order not to conclude with the passage on the serpent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

With the arrival of European, and eventually Israeli, Jewish educators, Beta Israel religious life underwent massive changes to align itself more closely with other branches of Judaism, and of course this process has only intensified in Israel. I know there are some Beta Israel synagogues emerging in Israel today and would be very interested to hear how they run their prayer services, and what they do with the Torah reading, <em>aliyot</em>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about Beta Israel liturgy, prayer, and religious life, check out these scholars (among others): <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ndTZGIxxJlgC&pg=PA136\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kay Kaufman Shelemay</a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=0YQfAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Margaret Hayon</a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=0YQfAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Frank Alvarez-Pereyre and S.

    "content": "# In the story about Eliezer searching for a wife for Yitzchak, why does the Torah alternate terminology about him between \"slave\" and \"man\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In viewing the story in Breishit 24, regarding Eliezer searching for a wife for Yitzchak, we see that the Torah first calls him עבד - slave (starting from the point that Eliezer leaves Avraham's home) in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>verses 10 and 17</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Beginning in verse 21, he is called איש - man, and we find this also in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>verses 22, 26, 30</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have excluded verse 34's use of עבד as Eliezer is talking, and he is describing himself and his \"job title\" (he was a civil servant :-)</p>\n\n<p>Then, beginning in verses 52, 53, 65 and 66, he is, again, called עבד.</p>\n\n<p>Verse 58, Rivka's parents call him איש, and I assume that's proper here in terms of asking Rivka the question of whether she will follow the \"man\" rather than asking \"Will you follow this slave?\" (I guess it would be less of an incentive for her to go with a slave?)</p>\n\n<p>verse 59, similarly uses the term ,  עבד אברהם  and I'm disregarding this example, as it  seems to describe his relation to Avraham in a similar way that verse 34 does.</p>\n\n<p>Verse 61 is a curious mix. First it calls him איש and then it calls him עבד .</p>\n\n<p>Why does the Torah alternate between these two terms? I couldn't quite notice a pattern, here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think that you will see that the reference to Ish occurs when he appears as the leader of a major caravan with 10 camels, showing wealth and needing to impress Rivkah's parents and brother with his position. Only when he gets to his mission is he called eved. This shows that his viewpoint is to do the best he can for his master and that his own concept of himself is that of eved. It is the viewpoint of the people who see him and see his dignity, and the way he bears himself who think of him as an ish.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Kaminetzky (Emes L'Yaakov Bereishis 24:39) explained that during the course of Eliezer's mission, he started out as \"eved\" (verses 2 - 17), but upon finding Rivka and completing his mission, he became \"blessed\" (as Lavan declares in verse 31), and therefore was transformed into an \"ish\" (verses 21 - 32). After completing his mission and about to bring Rivkah back to eved. Rav Yaakov thinks it is because he hinted that he had wanted his own daughter for Yitzchak. However, most meforshim say that this was to make sure that they would let Rivkah go. These meforshim say that he is referred to as eved because he insisted on completing his mission without delay. Note that in pasukim 58 and 61 he is referred to as Ish (with full dignity) because that is how he appeared to others, while eved is how he appears to himself and in 65 and 66 as compared to Yitzchak.</p>\n\n\n",

Ernest Klein's Etymological Dictionary (page 654) has 2 separate words spelled שיח. One is \"speak, talk, converse\" and is traced to the Arabic (was diligent) and is also spelled with a samech. The other means a shrub, traced to the Syriac and Akkadian (there are two other entries for words spelled this way, one being a swimmer and the other a pit or a ditch). So if both instances were employing one form (as will be shown in a moment) then they are linked. If the two instances are just two separate words which share a spelling then there is no connection.</p>\n\n<p>While Rashi says that lasu'ach is \"lashon tefilla\" and cites Tehillim (and calls forth a fascinating Siftei Chachamim), the Ibn Ezra disagrees. He says that lasu'ach means \"lalechet bein hasichim\" to go among the sichim, (my translation) -- with sichim being the trees or shrubs. The Rashbam says that he was simply walking among the trees (he doesn't mention talking or prayer at all) whereas the Sforno says that Yitzchak wandered off the road to \"pour his conversation (si'ach) bfore God in a field\" so he went (I am surmising) among the shrubs (sichim) in order to talk (si'ach). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>, in his <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0910818126\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary</a> on these two verses and on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.5?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 2:5</a>, says that \"שיח,\" in both contexts, refers to \"growth.\"</p>\n\n<p>In 21:15, R' Hirsch interprets \"תַּחַת אַחַד הַשִּׂיחִם\" as, generically, \"under something that was growing there,\" underlining Hagar's panicked indifference to where she dropped Yishmael, to the point of not taking note of whether the vegetation would be the comfortable kind or the harmful (e.g. thorny) kind.</p>\n\n<p>Slightly differently, in 2:5, R' Hirsch interprets \"שִׂיחַ\" as referring not to the vegetation (which Genesis 1 had told us predated mankind) but \"the activity of growth,\" which was awaiting rain, which God was yet to grant to the land as a gift to mankind.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, on 24:63, R' Hirsch comments that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שיח denotes the inner growth of spirit and feelings, gathering thoughts and feelings.

    "content": "# What kavanah should you have during *Atah Kadosh*?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The third blessing of the amidah, Atah Kadosh, seems mysterious to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are holy and your name is holy, and the holy ones bless you all day.   Blessed are you Hashem, the Holy God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there any particular kavanah that one one should be having while reciting this blessing? We know that God is holy but how is mentioning that a prayer and what significance does it have within the amidah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Amidah is divided up into 3 main sections. The first section, consisting of the first three <em>berachot</em> is called <em>shevach</em> (praise). The middle 13 <em>berachot</em> are called <em>bakasha</em> (request).  The final 3 <em>berachot</em> are called <em>hoda'ah</em> (thanks).</p>\n\n<p>The <em>beracha</em> of <em>ata kadosh</em> is part of the <em>shevach</em> section (not the <em>bakasha</em> section), so if your definition of the word \"prayer\" is \"request,\" then the answer to your question, \"[H]ow is mentioning that a prayer?\" is, \"it's not.\"</p>\n\n<p>I have heard the idea that the reason we put praise before request is because it is improper to approach God and immediately start asking for things. Instead, we start by praising him <em>and then</em> we proceed with our requests. I will attempt to find a source for this idea.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ran in his derashos, as well as the Kuzari, both explain the intent of the third blessing as follows:</p>\n\n<p>In the first two blessings, we focus on how Hashem is involved in this world, and in our lives, and does kindness towards us. We describe the <em>middos</em> of Hashem in how He relates to this world. One may incorrectly associate this with being descriptive of Hashem's essence. Therefore, before moving on to the request section of the Shemoneh Esrei, we declare that Hashem is <em>kadosh</em>, entirely separate and beyond our understanding. This is the intent that one should have, understanding that Hashem is, after all our attempts to relate to Him and understand Him, ultimately beyond our understanding.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://beureihatefila.com/files/The_Theme_Of_The_Bracha_Of_Ha_Kail_Ha_Kadosh-2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beurei Hatefilah</a> (see last page of article, esp.) the main focus of the bracha הקל הקדוש is the concept of קבלת עול מלכות שמים  (acceptance of the yoke of G-d's kingdom). While this has already been done during the recital of <em>Shema</em>, the article explains that there are 2 type of קבלות. The one in <em>Shema</em> is regarding the past, and the one in <em>Shemoneh Esreh</em> is regarding Mashiach. He claims that the original them of the blessing הקל הקדוש represents the Messianci fervor that existed after the destruction of the 2nd Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

The question however, seems to imply that someone has taken the sefer from the shul without first asking permission. Thus, using a sefer (that belongs to someone) in the <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5773/chayeisarah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">shul</a> is different than taking a sefer home from the shul without asking permission or notifying someone (such as the rav or the gabbai) who has the authority to allow it.</p>\n\n<p>If this is done, you have prevented someone else from being able to use it. That is why someone who uses a sefer in shul should return it to the shelf where it belongs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura in siman 14 sif 4 talks about borrowing a talis in a shul without permission. He brings down a number of reasons to limit the heter to do so (the Pri Megadim says that we don't rely on the chazaka of \"nicha lei\" when the owner is around and you could ask him; you can't take it out of the shul; there is a tumult in the poskim about how you must put it back). In the last sif katan in this sif he talks about borrowing seforim but does not talk about any of these reasons because the Rama himself asurs it based on the fact that seforim in those days were more fragile.</p>\n<p>The Piskei Teshuvos (great sefer, highly recommended) brings down a list of four other reasons not to rely on the heter (by a talis):</p>\n<p>A) The Mishna Berura says it's only mutar to rely on this heter \"b'akrai (happenstancially)\", but the geder of this is unclear.</p>\n<p>B) Some poskim say that this heter of nicha lei only applies by a mitzvah chiyuvis (unconditionally obligatory, think of tefillin), but not by a mitzvah kiyumis (is a mitzvah only under certain conditions, think of tzitzis). And in all likelihood, it's possible to accomplish talmud Torah (assuming it's a mitzvah chiyuvis, which is not pashut) in some other way than taking your friends sefer.</p>\n<p>C) Lots of people are makpid today on their property not to be borrowed. (See the reason he gives, lechorah it doesn't apply to seforim.)</p>\n<p>D) The risk is high, if you don't return it properly, or if you take it out of the building, it's gzeila.</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham is metzayen a Rama in C\"M siman 163 sif 6, at the very end of this very long Rama he brings down that he found in old takanos that it was made asur to remove seforim from the beis medresh without the permission of the owner. Also, the Shulchan Aruch Harav says outright that this heter of nicha lei doesn't apply to situations of taking the item from one house to another, as there is no chazaka that a person is okay with this.</p>\n<p>I try to be extremely cautious about this because the isur is one of gzeila (shoel she'lo mida'as gazlan, see Bava Metzia 41a). If you don't know with certainty that the person would be okay with you borrowing their sefer, you probably shouldn't. But, (to address your question directly) it should be noted that if the sefer is in a shul it would be <strong>mutar</strong> to learn from it <em>there</em> (like the Rama in C\"M says outright).</p>\n<p><em>The following was added in an edit</em></p>\n<p>I have since found in the תשובות הרי\"ף (סי' קלג) that he discusses a similar case to yours.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלה. אחד מן התלמידים גנב ספרי פרושין לחבירו וכשתבעו ממנו נשבע שבועה\nחמורה שלא יחזירם לו עד שיעתיק אותם ויש מי שהורה שמותר לגנבן.</p>\n<p>תשובה הגונב והמורה כלם טעו שלא כדין עשו שזה שהורה שמותר לעשות כן דומה\nלו משום שמתלמד דברי תורה שהיא מצוה היא וטעה משום שאמר לולב הגזול והיבש\nפסול ואתמר עלה משום דמצוה הבאה בעבירה המקום שונאה שנאמר כי ה' אוהב\nמשפט שונא גזל בעולה וגו' הילכך הורה ליה זה בהוראותו חוטא ומחטיא והגונב\nיש עליו ג' לאוין אחד משום גונב ואחד משום שנשבע שלא יחזיר אותם והו\"ל על\nדברי תורה נשבע שהיא גזלה ואחד משום גזל לפי שהוא גוזל שלא מדעת ואף על\nפי שהגזלה בכלל הגניבה היא אלא שנסתר בלקיחתן משום שאמר אל תגנוב את שלך\nמאחרי הגנב שלא תראה עליו כגנב ואם אסור בשלו כל שכן באחרים ואף אותה\nמצוה שנתכון לה לא עלתה בידו כמו שכתבו לולב הגזול והיבש פסול שלא עלתה\nבידו מצותו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>B'kitzur, the case he's dealing with is someone took another person's seforim in accordance with what he was told by a certain rabbi. When the victim of the robbery claimed his seforim back, the one who took them took a shvuah that he won't return them until he's done using them. The רי\"ף said in response to this case that the one who paskened that it was mutar to take the seforim was חוטא ומחטיא and the person who took them violated three aveiros, 1) gneiva, 2) swearing against the Torah, 3) gzeila <em>(btw, this רי\"ף is a very good מראה מקום for whenever you're learning gneiva and gzeila, because he says outright that every ganav is also a gazlan, which is a very lomdish point in Perek Meruba, ואכמ\"ל, ודו\"ק)</em>, and another point that the רי\"ף makes is that this person doesn't get שכר for the learning he may have done with these seforim <em>(again, this is a very lomdish point in the sugya of מצוה הבאה בעבירה, see תוספות בבא קמא דף בז. ד\"ה אמר עולא and the other rishonim over there)</em>.</p>\n<p>This case may be different to the one in your question, however, because this person had no intention of giving it back when the owner asked for it, he was only going to give it back when he was done with it. In you case, in all likelihood, if the shul asked for it back you would give it back and not stomp your foot on the ground and say \"but I\"m still using it.\"</p>\n<p>I hope this addition was helpful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would like to add to the above answers what Aruch HaShulchan (CM 292:34) has to say about lending out seforim:</p>\n<p>במקום ביטול תורה, שאין ספרים נמצאים, יכולין ב\"ד לכוף למי שיש לו ספרים להשאילם, ללמוד בהם, ולשלם לו בעד מה שיתקלקלו. וכן מותר מטעם זה להעתיק ספר, אף שהבעלים מקפידים. וכתיב (משלי ו:ל) \"לא יבוזו לגנב כי יגנוב\" זה שגונב ד\"ת ומעתיקן [מדרש משלי ותוספתא ב\"ק פ\"ז], דבכגון זה כופין על מדת סדום. ובימינו שהספרים מצוים בדפוס לא שייך זה. ומ\"מ עני ת\"ח שאין לו במה ללמוד, ובעל הספר אינו רוצה להשאיל לו ספריו, גדול עונו מנשוא, ויכולין ב\"ד לכופו להשאילו.</p>\n<p>Loosely translated: In a case of Bitul Torah, where there are no seforim to be found, Beis Din can force those who have seforimto lend them, to people who will study them, and pay him if they damage. It is also permissible for this reason to copy a sefer, even though the owners strictly don't allow it. The Pasuk says (Proverbs 6:30) \"A thief is not held in contempt\" This is reffering to one who steals and copies Torah [Midrash of Proverbs and Tosefta 2K 16]. In such a situation, we force people not to act like Sedom (when a person does not agree to do his friend a favor that does not involve any hassle, loss or sorrow). Nowadays, that we have printed Seforim, this isn't common. However, a great scholar who is a poor man, and has nothing to study, and the owner of the sefer does not want to lend him his seforim, his punishment is too great to bear, and Bes Din can force him to lend it.</p>\n<p>I will also add that there is a Tshuva from The Ri'eim (brought in Shu\"t Maharsham, She'arim Mitzuyanim Bihalacha, Yad Malachi and Mishna Achrona) that holds that since the gemara paskens \"נִיחָא לֵיהּ לְאִינִישׁ לְקַיּוֹמֵי מִצְוָה בְּמָמוֹנֵי\" (Psachim 4b) that a person truly desires that mitzvos be done with his money, even if someone is standing and screaming that he doesn't let, we don't listen to him.</p>\n<p>I hope this opens up a new perspective to how one must go about lending his seforim and all other klei kodesh, like tefiin, talis etc.</p>\n<p>Hatzlacha!</p>\n\n\n",

The life of a person is not \"his\" - rather, it belongs to\n  the One Who granted that life. It may be therefore be reclaimed only\n  by the true Owner of that life. Despite one's noble intentions, an act\n  of mercy-killing is flagrant intervention into a domain that\n  transcends this world. </p>\n  \n  <p>One source in the Chumash for this prohibition may be found the Book\n  of Genesis <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8173\">9 (5)</a>: \"But your blood of your lives will I require; ...from the\n  hand of man, from the hand of a person's brother, will I require the\n  life of man.\" The additional phrase \"a person's brother\" after having\n  already stated \"from the hand of man\" is redundant. The author of the\n  book HaKtav v'haKaballah explains that this verse refers to a\n  prohibition against euthanasia. Although murder is the opposite of\n  brotherly love, one might think that euthanasia is in fact a permitted\n  expression of brotherly love. This verse imprints on our conscience\n  that this particular form of \"brotherly love\" is nothing more than\n  plain murder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are at least two classical cases in the gemara, and (unsurprisingly) they would lead to conflicting generalizations. The halakhah's position is nuanced.</p>\n\n<p>The first case is the people of the city of Luz. This was a remarkable city where no one lied. It was where they made tekheiles dye. Sancheirev didn't touch the city when he conquered Israel at the end of the First Commonwealth, etc... But also, no one in Luz ever die. What did old people do? When life got too bad, they would leave the city. (Sotah 46a)</p>\n\n<p>The other is the martyrdom of Rabbi Chanina ben Teradion. The Romans put him to death by fire, wrapped up in a sefer Torah. But in order to make the suffering last, to slow the burning, they placed wet cotton between himself and the parchment. His students begged Rabbi Chanina ben Teradion to open his mouth, breath in the smoke, and thereby hasten his death by suffocated. He refused, saying that it wasn't for him to end his own life. Despite all his suffering (AZ 18a)</p>\n\n<p>One story implying euthanasia is okay, the other about someone refusing the way out.</p>\n\n<p>Halakhah prohibits euthanasia, but... There are situations where not everyone would require heroic efforts are not mandatory to maintain life.</p>\n\n<p>What this means in practice is that it's prohibited to \"pull the plug\" on a running machine that is keeping someone alive. However, if the machine is routinely disconnected for a few seconds, eg to change filters, to change cannula, etc..., many of the more noted decisors would say it is not mandatory -- and at times prohibited! -- to turn it back on.</p>\n\n<p>To give more details.</p>\n\n<p>I had a teenage cousin in this circumstance, and this was the ruling the previous Bostoner Rebbe zt\"l gave her father. But it's consistent with published responsa.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igeros Moshe CM 2 ) and R SZ Auerbach (Minchat Shlomo 91:24) rules that a patient does not need to choose life extending treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igeros Moshe YD 2, 174.3) altogether prohibits extending someone's suffering in such a circumstance.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, R' Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer 15 40:4) ruled that the choice is not theirs, and the treatment must be given.

It is ignorant to state corn is not kosher. All vegetables free from bugs are kosher to eat. There is a 17th Mexican Inquisition trial where a Converso (i.e. descendant of Sephardic Jews converted to Christianity) only ate corn tortillas during Passover, instead of leavened bread. Any leavened wheat flour product is forbidden to eat during Passover. Check Gitlitz' Secrecy and Deceit for the Inquisition trial source.\nAlthough the idea that Conversos may have brought the innovation, to my understanding flat bread was not a feature of the Iberian Jewish diet. In all probability, the adaptation from corn to flour was brought about because in the north of Mexico corn is not a staple that grows abundantly. </p>\n\n\n",

Rav Ben-zion Meir Chai Uziel, Rishon Letzion, [in 1939 appointed Chief Rabbi of Palestine] says the same about the lights lit in synagogue for the yahrtzeit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הראשונים כתבו בשם רבנו אשר שנוהגים להדליק בערב יום הכיפורים \"נר או\n  פנס... לכפר על אביו ועל אמו כי כבוד הוא להשם יתברך, שנאמר 'באורים כבדו\n  ד''\" (ארחות חיים הלכות ערב יום הכיפורים ס' י\"א; כלבו סח), אך הוסיפו:\n  \"לפי שצריכין לקרות בספר כל היום וכל הלילה תמיד... וזולת זה לא יראו\n  לקרות בלילות, ועוד נהגו בזה לכבוד השם ולכבוד בית הכנסת על דרך 'באורים\n  כבדו ד''\" (כלבו שם).</p>\n  \n  <p>כלומר, הטעם שהדלקת הנר מכפרת היא משום שניתן להתפלל וללמוד לאורו, וזכות\n  התפילה והלימוד היא המביאה לעילוי נשמת הנפטר. וכתב על כך הראשון לציון\n  הגאון הרב בן-ציון מאיר חי עוזיאל: \"ונרות שמדליקין ביום יארצייט הוא\n  לעילוי נשמה... והוא בכלל ברא מזכה אבא [=הבן מזכה את אביו], בפעולת מצוה\n  של הארת בית הכנסת שהוא לכבוד בית הכנסת, ולהאיר עיני הצבור בלמודם\n  ותפלתם שמתוך הספר...\" (שו\"ת משפטי עוזיאל ג או\"ח ס' כג. ).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לסיכום: נר נשמה או נר זיכרון אינם חובה ממש, אינם מצווה ואין להם מקור\n  קדום, אבל הדלקתם היא מנהג קדוש שהתקבל בעם ישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The yahrzeit light is not a real obligation, not a mitzva and it does not have an early source. But lighting it is a holy custom which has been accepted by the Jewish people. </p>\n\n<p>I assume that the memorial light plaques are the modern equivalent of those lights lit in the shul for yahrtzeit or Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n\n",

Only after the sale is complete (in verse 19) does the text revert to naming Sarah.</p>\n\n<p>Why would the text not name her as the reason he is buying the grave site? Was Avraham trying to hide her identity from Ephron? Is this to teach that we don't name the dead when making arrangements? [I get the sense that the Ibn Ezra is saying something, but I don't know what.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsvch seems to deal with this in Chayei Sarah 23:4 dealing with the meaning of the word אחוזה Avraham is requesting a permanent burial site for \"his dead\". Thus he does not reference \"Sarah my wife\" but \"my dead\" in order to get the land as a cemetery.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So that the underlying idea of אחוזה is being settled, the act of\n  permanent settling. Avraham does not ask for permission just to bury\n  his wife. He wants his wife to rest in her permanent everlasting\n  posession of her resting place., that is why he first asks for the\n  right to acquire a piece of land as freehold property for the purpose\n  of a sephulcre.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Sarah is \"his dead\" he refers to her in the singular because she is lying in front of him ready to be buried. He is referring to her as the status of the dead person who is there ready to be buried who must be treated (as all dead people must) with respect and immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, he is speaking to the official legislative council of the Bnei Ches. As such, he must refer to the situation in techanical and legalistic terminology.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also points out in 23:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He only left his dead in order to make arrangements for it; hence our\n  sages lay down the law that as long as the dead be unburied; the\n  relative is to think of nothing else than attending to the business of\n  seeing that the dead receives its due.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus he is not able to think of her as Sarah his beloved wife, but as \"his dead\" who requires action on her behalf.</p>\n\n\n",

עד שמוחלין לו. ולזה תקנו ברכת סלח לנו שלש פעמים בכל יום על עון ביטול תורה שאין אדם ניצול ממנו בכל יום וכמו התמיד שהיה מכפר על מצות עשה. ואין זה אחטא ואשוב אא\"כ שבשעת החטא ממש הוא סומך על התשובה ולכך חוטא כמ\"ש במ\"א:\n  However, here below, [the union] is within the limits of time, persisting only during such time when one is occupied in the study of Torah,, or in the performance of a commandment. For afterwards, if he engages in anything else, he is here below separated from the Higher Unity. This is so when he occupies himself with altogether vain things which are utterly useless for the Divine Service. Nevertheless, should he later repent and return to the service of G-d, to Torah and prayer, and ask forgiveness of G-d for not having engaged in the Torah when he could have done so, G-d will pardon him. To quote the Rabbis: \"If one has transgressed against a positive precept, but has repented, he is pardoned on the spot.\" Therefore they instituted the blessing of \"Forgive us\" to be recited three times daily for the sin of neglecting the Torah, a sin which no one can escape each day. Similarly the daily burnt-offering used to bring atonement for neglect of the positive precepts. This is not the same as saying, \"I will sin and repent afterwards,\" unless at the time he is committing the sin he relies on subsequent repentance and sins because of it, as explained elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, if you're not doing something else that will help you with the service of G-d, you need to be learning Torah. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sequel to the Sefer \" Laws of Daily Living \"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a well known Sefer on Halacha called <em>Laws of Daily Living</em> by Rav Simcha Bunim Cohen , noted <em>Posek</em> and author. There is only one volume and the last topic is the laws of <em>פסוקי דזמרה</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on an easy-to-read English <em>Halacha</em> <em>Sefer</em> that would act as sort of a sequel to his Sefer (i.e., a Sefer that starts off with the laws of <em>Birchos Krias Shema</em> ?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Of all the simple halacha books I read in English, the one I liked best an which best matches the level of <em>Laws of Daily Living</em> is <a href=\"http://amzn.com/1583304347\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Halachah by R Zeev Greenwald</a></p>\n\n<p>If you want something more elaborate the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch is the real classic. In English there is an older edition from R Avraham Davis or <a href=\"http://amzn.com/1422611043\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a much better edition from artscroll</a> (also exists on iPad and Android)</p>\n\n<p>There is also a recent book which was originally written for yeshiva students as a set of \"all the practical laws you need to know\": <a href=\"http://a.co/aYDijQs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halacha 24/7/12</a>. It is remarkable in that it is both broad, highly accessible to everyone, incredibly practical and actually interesting to read. In a number of places the author show pragmatism by writing \"Artscroll says X but basic halacha is Y\". The goal of the author is to show halacha is not \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.12?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the heaven or beyond the sea</a>\" but instead very approachable. It does cover in detail the laws of prayer and of daily living.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What dates were the Talmuds and Midrashes written?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can we prove what dates in history these texts were written? </p>\n\n<p>Also, do we know exactly when the various Rabbis of these texts lived? What are those dates? Are there disputes about this? </p>\n\n<p>Further, which historical records and artifacts are used to corroborate these dates? Are there any good books written on the topic?</p>\n\n<p>There can be various practical applications for Jewish law if we know exactly when these texts were written. For example, if the Yerushalmi was written around the same time as the Bavli, then we may be able to rule like it against the Bavli, because Klal Yisrael didn't have a chance to disprove the Yerushalmi and make a final ruling whether the Bavli is the final word in halacha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are some general understandings on these things. The Yerushalmi is believed to be completed by Rabbi Yochanan, Reish Lakish, and their peers around the year 350; the Bavli, by Ravina and Rav Ashi (and one generation past them), around the year 500. We generally follow the Bavli as it had the time to consider the Yerushalmi, then supersede it.</p>\n\n<p>Some works of midrashim are considered more strongly \"Tannaitic\", i.e. we believe they were edited into their current form by the year 300 or so; others may not have been compiled until almost the year 1000. (E.g. when Rashi quotes midrashim from Rabbi Moshe HaDarshan.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is very little room for doubt as for when the Bavli was compiled and written. It was obviously before the Geonim. We have multiple early Rishonim with no geographic connection, all referring to the Talmud and Geonim. We have the Geonim referencing the Talmud before them.</p>\n\n<p>We have Rav Ashi <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">mentioning the king Izgor</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WJE1AAAAMAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yezdejerd (Izdegerdes)</a>(p.185) which is about the year 400 so we know it is after that and it is pretty obviously before Mohammad.</p>\n\n<p>But mainly, we have a chain that goes back. It is not something we have out of no place. We know exactly when the Rambam, Rashi, Rabbenu Tam, Rav Hai Gaon were. They were as aware of those before them.</p>\n\n<p>As for the Yerushalmi, there wasn't much Torah in Eretz Yisroel by the end of the Talmudic period. The very early Rishonim tell us that it was compiled much earlier than the Bavli. Compiled doesn't mean written, though.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, we are students of the Babylonian Yeshivos and Geonim. It was the Geonim of Bavel who sent responsa all around. And it was from Bavel com where the original teachers and disseminators of Torah originated.</p>\n\n<p>Very often, probably most often, history and direct chains are a more reliable source of knowledge than spoons and toys we dig up.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it necessary to add this, or is it permissible to recite Tefillat haDerekh again on the way home instead? Assuming that the latter option is permissible, would it not be preferable?

If you plan on making a round-trip journey in one day, you should add in the line and only say the prayer once. We avoid saying unnecessary blessings. (<em>Bracha she'eina tzricha.</em>) Just as if you're handed a piece of meat and a glass of water, you should say shehakol on the meat and have in mind to include the water, rather than say two separate shehakols.

At first, he did not want to do it. In this verse, when Rivkah says \"what <strong>you</strong> did to him\", there seems to be no implication that she accepts responsibility for his action. There is also no verse indicating Ya'akov complaining or challenging what his mother just said.</p>\n\n<p>Was Rivka implying that the action was <strong>entirely</strong> Ya'akov's responsibility? If so, could Ya'akov have refused to follow his mother's orders without disobeying <em>Kibud Av Va'em</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This interpretation I am providing is <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/authors/48867802.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi David Fohrman</a>'s from alephbeta.org</p>\n\n<p>The problem with looking at the Biblical stories is that we often read them quickly, and we know how the story ends before we've even read it, both these things color how you interpret the actions of the characters. But if you slow down and don't insert any commentaries into what's happening, you can see things in a much more different (and arguably correct) way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ו  וְרִבְקָה, אָמְרָה, אֶל-יַעֲקֹב בְּנָהּ, לֵאמֹר:  הִנֵּה\n  שָׁמַעְתִּי אֶת-אָבִיךָ, מְדַבֵּר אֶל-עֵשָׂו אָחִיךָ לֵאמֹר.  6 And\n  Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying: 'Behold, I heard thy father\n  speak unto Esau thy brother, saying: ז  הָבִיאָה לִּי צַיִד\n  וַעֲשֵׂה-לִי מַטְעַמִּים, וְאֹכֵלָה; וַאֲבָרֶכְכָה לִפְנֵי יְהוָה,\n  לִפְנֵי מוֹתִי.   7 Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I\n  may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. ח  וְעַתָּה\n  בְנִי, שְׁמַע בְּקֹלִי--לַאֲשֶׁר אֲנִי, מְצַוָּה אֹתָךְ.  8 Now\n  therefore, my son, hearken to my voice according to that which I\n  command thee. ט  לֶךְ-נָא, אֶל-הַצֹּאן, וְקַח-לִי מִשָּׁם שְׁנֵי\n  גְּדָיֵי עִזִּים, טֹבִים; וְאֶעֱשֶׂה אֹתָם מַטְעַמִּים לְאָבִיךָ,\n  כַּאֲשֶׁר אָהֵב.  9 <strong>Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two\n  good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury food for thy\n  father, such as he loveth; י  וְהֵבֵאתָ לְאָבִיךָ, וְאָכָל, בַּעֲבֻר\n  אֲשֶׁר יְבָרֶכְךָ, לִפְנֵי מוֹתוֹ.    10 and thou shalt bring it to thy\n  father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.'</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is absolutely no indication from her words/commands to Yaacov that she had any intention of tricking Yitzchak. All she said to do was to go get two goats in hopes that she could prepare them, and then Yaacov could bring them to Yitzchak before Esau got back so that way Yitzchak might decide to give the blessing to Yaacov instead. Read the text over and over again, and you will see nothing nefarious in her words. However, Yaacov's response to them is very interesting.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>יא  וַיֹּאמֶר יַעֲקֹב, אֶל-רִבְקָה אִמּוֹ:  הֵן עֵשָׂו אָחִי אִישׁ שָׂעִר, וְאָנֹכִי אִישׁ חָלָק. 11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother: 'Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</strong>\n  יב  אוּלַי יְמֻשֵּׁנִי אָבִי, וְהָיִיתִי בְעֵינָיו כִּמְתַעְתֵּעַ; וְהֵבֵאתִי עָלַי קְלָלָה, וְלֹא בְרָכָה. 12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.'\n  <strong>יג  וַתֹּאמֶר לוֹ אִמּוֹ, עָלַי קִלְלָתְךָ בְּנִי; אַךְ שְׁמַע בְּקֹלִי, וְלֵךְ קַח-לִי.  13 And his mother said unto him: 'Upon me be thy curse, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go fetch me them.'</strong>\n  יד  וַיֵּלֶךְ, וַיִּקַּח, וַיָּבֵא, לְאִמּוֹ; וַתַּעַשׂ אִמּוֹ מַטְעַמִּים, כַּאֲשֶׁר אָהֵב אָבִיו. 14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved.\n  טו  וַתִּקַּח רִבְקָה אֶת-בִּגְדֵי עֵשָׂו בְּנָהּ הַגָּדֹל, הַחֲמֻדֹת, אֲשֶׁר אִתָּהּ, בַּבָּיִת; וַתַּלְבֵּשׁ אֶת-יַעֲקֹב, בְּנָהּ הַקָּטָן.   15 And Rebekah took the choicest garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.\n  טז  וְאֵת, עֹרֹת גְּדָיֵי הָעִזִּים, הִלְבִּישָׁה, עַל-יָדָיו--וְעַל, חֶלְקַת צַוָּארָיו.   16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.\n  יז  וַתִּתֵּן אֶת-הַמַּטְעַמִּים וְאֶת-הַלֶּחֶם, אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂתָה, בְּיַד, יַעֲקֹב בְּנָהּ.  17 And she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the plain reading of the text, it was Yaacov's idea to dress up like Esau and trick his father, not Rivka's. But we do see that Rivka decides to go along with Yaacov's plan, and she even tries to take responsibility for it to encourage him to do it, but again her focus is always on cooking the food.</p>\n\n<p>This is why the words in verse 45 stand out to you. She says \"what you did to him\" because her original plan had nothing to do with tricking Yitzchak or pretending to be Esau, those things were entirely Yaacov's plan. When you read the story this way, future events are easier to understand, such as why Yaacov is continuously punished for his deceit moreso than Rivkah, and why Laban isn't punished by Hashem for having deceived Yaacov, because Yaacov was receiving his due punishment for what he had done.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the pasuk, Eisav either did not know or did not consider what his mother had done. All he knew was what Yaakov had done by coming in and \"stealing\" the bracha. As a result, Rivkah said \"wait until your brother forgets what you have done\". She is not blaming Ya'akov for anything, she is speaking about Eisav's viewpoint. This is the way that I read the pasuk as the meforshim that I have here do not deal with it explicitly. I also have not seen any reference that refer back to Rivkah at all.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that from the way Rav Hirsch explains the pasuk that he seems to think that Eisav blamed Ya'akov only for what had happened. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is evident that Rivkah had the best opinion of Eisav's feelings,\n  that he would be able to forget even the wrong which he had endured</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One answer is, that it might not have been the same Avimelech!</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaYashar_(midrash)%2C_Book_of_Genesis%2C_Chayei_Sara?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaYashar, Chayei Sarah</a> tells us that around the time Sarah died Avimelech died at the age of 193 and they anointed Benmelech / Nimloch his son (then aged 12 years old), as his successor. And they called him Avimelech as that was their custom.</p>\n<p>It writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויהי לתקופת השנה וימת אבימלך מלך פלשתים בשנה ההיא, בן מאת שנה ושלוש ותשעים שנה היה במותו. וילך אברהם עם אנשיו ארץ פלשתים וינחמו את כל בתי אבימלך וכל עבדיו, ויפן וישב אל ביתו.</p>\n<p><em>And it was during this period of the year, Avimelech king of the Philistines, died in that year.

And Avimelech ‎ruled in the place of his father and he sat upon his throne.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, Yitzchak didn't need to reprove him because he wasn't the same Avimelech from the time of Avraham!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Based on the way that the p'sukim are written it appears that the servants of Avimelech did not try (this time) to seize the wells by force. This time the used \"lawfare\" by claiming that the water was legally theirs. Thus, Avimelech did not try to defend himself by saying that he had never been told about it. That is also why Yitzchak just moved elsewhere to dig a different well. He did not want to get involved in lawsuits.</p>\n\n<p>As I say in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/48592/is-ber-26-in-the-proper-chronological-place/48594#48594\">Is Ber. 26 in the proper chronological place?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have the medrashim that Eisav was already leading a band of men.\n  These men were the \"family defense force\".

Nonetheless, the Mishna in Avot <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.11?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 2</a> says (this is a text that contains the spirit of Torah ethics as passed down from God to Moses…) that hatred of people destroys the person who hates.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, according to Rambam (Maimonides), even the 7 nations of Canaan and Amalek whom we are commanded to exterminate, were able to surrender and make peace with Israel and even continue to live in the Land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>I understand from all of this that one should strive to hate only the sin but not the sinner, because the sinner can still change their ways and return to a moral life. Only God knows who is 100% evil. The hatred we are <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.5.5?qh=%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%A7&lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">commanded</a> to have for Amalek is for the collective race; even so, the individuals can change their ways.

If there was a commandment for Jews to hate Muslims, I believe it is safe to say that such an important religious Jew would not be violating that commandment.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, nowadays, there is definitely animosity in many cases between Jews and Muslims. In my opinion, this can be traced to the political conflict over the Land of Israel that is essentially divided along religious lines. But hate by Jews against Muslims is entirely because of intolerance and not because of any specific religious commandment to hate the other. Just like there are intolerant Muslims who hate Jews simply for being Jews, there are indeed some intolerant Jews who hate Muslims simply for being Muslims. Intolerance based on superficial differences is an ugly trait and is certainly not advocated by the Holy Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.12?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avoth 1:12</a> cites an injunction to love all G-d's creatures:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִלֵּל אוֹמֵר, הֱוֵי מִתַּלְמִידָיו שֶׁלְאַהֲרֹן, אוֹהֵב שָׁלוֹם וְרוֹדֵף שָׁלוֹם, אוֹהֵב אֶת הַבְּרִיּוֹת וּמְקָרְבָן לַתּוֹרָה</p>\n<p>Hillel says, \"Be of the disciples of Aharon, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving the creatures and bringing them closer to Torah.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, as opposed to the unconditional love/forgiveness preached by many Christians, and as opposed to the \"pluralism\" preached by many liberals, Judaism does indeed limit this love and tolerance of mankind.

An Israeli mother is right to raise her child to hate Saddam Hussein, but she would fail as a parent if she taught him to despise every Arab.</p>\n<p>...When we are facing those who seek nothing but our destruction, our hate reminds us who we are dealing with. When hate is appropriate, then it is not only virtuous, but essential for Jewish well-being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Here is my general \"meek\" understanding:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>already cooked liquids may not be reheated</li>\n<li>pre-cooked solids that become liquids when heated may not be reheated</li>\n<li>pre-cooked solid foods that remain solids may be reheated because of a rule <em>en bishul achar bishul</em> - cooked foods can't be re-cooked.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In a shiur that I heard some time ago, if I heard correctly, the rav stated that baked foods, regardless of what form they are, may not be reheated in an oven (the oven has been on all of Shabbat) because <em>yesh afi'ah achar afi'ah</em> - baked foods can be rebaked. Is this correct? If so, why is baking different than cooking?</p>\n\n<p>If reheating baked foods is permitted, in the case of chocolate meltaway cake, when baking the meltaway, the chocolate will change from a solid to a liquid. My understanding is that this is prohibited. Is that assumption correct in this case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch O'C' 318' 5' discusses an argument in between the Poskim whether or not there is 'Bishul' (cooking) after 'Tselee' (roasting) or 'Afiyah' (baking).</p>\n\n<p>However,as the Mishnah Berurah points out in Se'eef Koton 41', according to all Poskim there is no Tselee after Tselee. Afiyah is equivalent to Tselee as they are both dry. Therefore we conclude that there is no Afiyah after Afiyah either.</p>\n\n<p>[Now i add, that altough the Shlchan Aruch does not mention Afia specifically, the Tur however  mentions it out right as being equal to Tselee.]</p>\n\n<p>Regarding delicious Chocolate Melt away cake; in Se'eef 16' the Shulchan Aruch discusses a similar idea - Bread with a filling of fat inside, which contains 2 potential problems with reheating it. One being Bishul and the other 'Nolad' which means creating something new.</p>\n\n<p>The Mechaber allows it and the Mishnah Berurah explains that since before reheating it, it is dry there is no Bishul anymore although when reheated it shall be soft.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the issue of Nolad, it is permitted being that he does not melt it with his bare hands. However the Re'Ma brings down those that are stringent in the aspect of Nolad. They claim that since when it melts it will flow out and will be noticeable by itself there will be a problem of Nolad.</p>\n\n<p>However, says the Mishnah Berurah, when there isn't that much fat and only a little will flow out it shall be allowed according to all opinions for that would not be considered an entity in itself in order for it to go into Nolad.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah says as well that heating up a piece of Chicken which contains some fat on top of it will be permitted since it is a small amount it is not Choshuv (significant), and would be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Considering our Cake, if the Chocolate right now is not in a liquid state it shall not be Bishul although it will melt upon reheating.</p>\n\n<p>Nolad, it will not either be since there is no vast amount of Chocolate which would bring a lot of liquid to flow out upon heating, but rather just relatively small amount will flow out and being its not a significant amount, it won't be considered its own new entity to be regarded as Nolad.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all this, it would be permitted to reheat the cake in a place next to fire even when it will heat it up to the extent that it will be 'yad soledes bo' meaning that your hand will hurt a significant amount after keeping your hand on it for a couple of seconds.</p>\n\n<p>However on the fire one may not put it, as the halacha states in siman 253' that mi'derabanan, because of the Chacamim's fear that one will end up playing around with the fire in a way that will be considered Havarah which is the Melacha of lighting a fire and that includes placing it on the blech right on top of the fire which is as good as placing it on the fire directly.</p>\n\n<p>The blech helps only to allow one to return something that was on the fire on Shabbos and that is called chazarah.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore reheating the cake will be permitted when its not directly on the fire  as the Shulchan Aruch calls it 'keneged ha'medurah'.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to reheat the cake would be to use an electric hot-plate (plata). There are differing opinions as to whether one can place cold, cooked, dry food directly onto the plata, on an upturned (empty) pan on the plata, or on top of another pot cooking on the plata. See the answers <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12627/using-a-plata-on-shabbat/12726#12726\">here</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p>However, as far as this all relates to the original question (reheating the cake in an oven) it is generally assumed that one cannot reheat cold, cooked, dry food in an oven which is still on (even if the oven has a \"shabbat\" mode). See <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2014/01/an-oven-with-shabbat-mode/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. This is presumably equivalent to 'placing the food directly on the fire', as mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n",

I know that canon constitutes only a portion of Jewish books but for example in the book of Kings, we read the kings to be \"sleeping\" with their fathers. Also psalms refer to restitution of the person in this world and not a promise for the future.</p>\n\n<p>So can you please bring references (ideally from the Jewish Bible, alternatively other books of your faith) which refers to the resurrection of the dead and afterlife. Obviously there is <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2037\">Ezekiel</a> and resurrection of the bones but I feel the context is different.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p><strong>Deut. 7:11 states: \"You shall observe the commandment, and the decrees, and the ordinances, that I command you, <em>today</em>, to perform them.\"</strong></p>\n<p>The Torah writes about Earthly rewards, and not a lot about the world to come (afterlife) or the resurrection (see further in Deut. Ch.7:12-etc.)</p>\n<p>One reason for this is the word \"today\" in Deut.7:11. The Torah is meant to be a guide to G-d's will in this world. This world was meant for us to work. As Rashi comments on the verse: \"Today to perform them\" - and tomorrow, in the world to come, to receive their reward. - (Rashi applying a quote from Talmud Eiruvin 22a)</p>\n<p>If the Torah would focus on the next world, people would be distracted from their job in this world here and now; \"today\".</p>\n<p>Another reason behind the focus on \"today\", is to show how G-d's word is true, and other religions are false. Although G-d does offer dual rewards in this world and in the next one; His focus in the Torah, is all about this world.</p>\n<p>We have a saying. \"He who wishes to lie, usually speaks of far away things.\"\nA good liar will claim things that are not easily verifiable, but sound really good. Many world religions, have their priests/preachers, give sermons about the great rewards awaiting followers in the afterlife. Only G-d, removed almost all promises of an afterlife from his official book, and instead promises hard cold Earthly rewards as His focus. Look how fair G-d is to His followers. He offers a reward you can feel and touch. You will know if He keeps His word now; not after you are already dead. :)</p>\n<p>Of course, the Tanach does talk about the afterlife and resurrection as a fact. Jewish people realize that the world to come plays a role in our belief system, and is more important than Earthly rewards. So, the Tanach will remind us of it. Here are some verses:</p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 5:24</strong></p>\n<p>\"...and Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for <em>G-d had taken him</em>.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 25:8 (and many places)</strong></p>\n<p>\"And Abraham expired and died at a good old age, mature and content, and <em>he was gathered to his people</em>.\"</p>\n<p>This terminology implies that Abraham would go on to his own afterlife with his family etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Kohelet (Eccl.) 12:7</strong></p>\n<p>12:1 \"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.\"...12:5 ...because man goes to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets...\"</p>\n<p>12:7 \"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: <strong>and the soul shall return unto G-d who gave it.</strong>\"</p>\n<p><strong>2 Samuel 12:23</strong></p>\n<p>22 And he said: 'While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said: Who knoweth whether the L-rd will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?</p>\n<p>23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? <strong>I shall go to him</strong>, but he will not return to me.\"</p>\n<p>It is interesting to read the entire event in 1 Samuel 28. Samuel specifically rises from his rest and informs King Saul that he would join him in the afterlife. In fact, one may consider why the Torah would forbid people from consulting the dead (Deut.18:11) if dead people cease to exist?</p>\n<p><strong>1 Samuel 28:19</strong></p>\n<p>\"...tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me.\"</p>\n<p><strong>2 Kings 2:11</strong></p>\n<p>\"....and Elijah <em>ascended to heaven</em> in a whirlwind.\"</p>\n<p>Obviously, as someone else pointed out, Isaiah 26:19, and Daniel 12:2, are pretty straightforward as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Isaiah 26:19</strong></p>\n<p>\"May your dead come to life, may my corpses arise. Awake and shout for joy, you who rest in the dirt.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel 12:2</strong></p>\n<p>\"Many of those who sleep in the dusty Earth will awaken.

Through the ages, there have been groups who deny the afterlife and resurrection. Mostly, it is because it is deemed illogical. However, Judaism finds it to be a very logical concept taught throughout our own Oral Torah. One reason is because it is in line with G-d's idea of true justice. Another is because it just seems that it would be natural for G-d to do so.</p>\n<p>Caesar asked Rabban Gamliel: Dead people become dirt. How can dirt live again? The daughter of Caesar said, \"Rabbi, let me handle this question.\" She asked her father: There are two potters in our town, one makes vessels using water and one uses clay. Which one is a greater craftsman? Caesar answered, of course, the one who can form vessels out of water. She said, if G-d makes people out of an (original) drop of water, then certainly he can make people out of dirt!</p>\n<p>A certain heretic once said to Geviah ben Pesissah (a Rabbi): Woe to you sinners who say that the dead will live! If the living must die, then the dead should certainly experience (continuous)death! Geviah answered: Woe to you sinners who deny! If people who never existed can live, then people who once lived can certainly live again!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The answer is there are few if any Biblical references. The afterlife is more emphasized in the oral tradition than in the actual Bible. Which is why you had the Sadduccees (the priestly Jews who only believed in the first five books of the Bible with no oral tradition) who did not believe in an afterlife at all. To this day there are still many Jews who are ambivalent about the afterlife, it's not something we talk about often (if it all). Which is probably more of a response to the emphasis in which Christians and Muslims talk about it and their consequences. Holy wars, crusades, are often brought about by the emphasis of, or promises for, the afterlife for their participants.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, you can read an essay from the Jewish virtual library. Here is a snippet of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah, therefore, might have been silent about afterlife out of a\n  desire to ensure that Judaism not evolve in the direction of the death\n  obsessed Egyptian religion. Throughout history, those religions that\n  have assigned a significant role to afterlife have often permitted\n  other religious values to become distorted. For example, belief in the\n  afterlife motivated the men of the Spanish Inquisition to torture\n  innocent human beings; they believed it was morally desirable to\n  torture people for a few days in this world until they accepted\n  Christ, and thereby save them from the eternal torments of hell.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Judaism the belief in afterlife is less a leap of faith than a\n  logical outgrowth of other Jewish beliefs. If one believes in a God\n  who is all-powerful and all-just, one cannot believe that this world,\n  in which evil far too often triumphs, is the only arena in which human\n  life exists. For if this existence is the final word, and God permits\n  evil to win, then it cannot be that God is good. Thus, when someone\n  says he or she believes in God but not in afterlife, it would seem\n  that either they have not thought the issue through, or they don't\n  believe in God, or the divine being in whom they believe is amoral or\n  immoral.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Some passages that are understood by some to refer to personal resurrection include:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Isa-26\">Isaiah 26:19</a>:<br>\n  Oh, let Your dead revive!<br>\n  Let corpses arise!<br>\n  Awake and shout for joy,<br>\n  You who dwell in the dust!—<br>\n  For Your dew is like the dew on fresh growth;<br>\n  You make the land of the shades come to life.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Job-19\">Job 19:25-27</a>:<br>\n  But I know that my Vindicator lives;<br>\n  In the end He will testify on earth—<br>\n  This, after my skin will have been peeled off.<br>\n  But I would behold God while still in my flesh,<br>\n  I myself, not another, would behold Him;<br>\n  Would see with my own eyes:<br>\n  My heart pines within me.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Dan-12\">Daniel 12:1-2</a>: “At that time, the great prince, Michael, who stands beside the sons of your people, will appear.

I think he signed the civil marriage document but that was in his rabbinic capacity -- it was not part of the wedding ceremony.

(Not that he cannot officiate the services).</p>\n\n<p>The Taz (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.49.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 49:1</a>) writes that one need not have such great expertise to conduct a kiddushin, since it is simple and does not require issuing halakhic rulings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבנתינת קידושין אין שם הרבה פרטים באותו סידור ואין מצוין שינוים שם ששייך בהם הוראה ...וכן המנהג בינינו שמכבדין בסידור קידושין אפילו אינו למדן גדול </p>\n  \n  <p>For in giving kiddushin there arent many details, and details that require legal rulings are not present there...And so is the custom among us to honor with <em>siddur kiddushin</em> even one who is not a great scholar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maharsha writes similarly, in his Hiddushei Aggadot to Kiddushin (13a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבקדושין לחוד הכל יודעין בו גם להתיר פנויה לאיש הוא דבר קל ולזה נשתרבב המנהג בדורינו שנותנין רשות לכל אדם היודע קצת לעסוק בקדושין... \n  משא\"כ בגיטין שרבו כמו רבו דיניה והלכותיה בחומר א\"א להתירה אין לאדם לעסוק בהן כ\"א היודע כו' וכן בקדושין שאחר הגיטין באלו לא יהיה מתעסק בהן כ\"א היודע בטיב גיטין שהיו קודם הקידושין אם גיטין גמורים היו דשמא לא היה גט ויתיר ע\"י קדושין שאחריו א\"א לעלמא  </p>\n  \n  <p>For regarding mere marriage everyone is familiar with it. Also to permit an unmarried woman to a man is a minor thing, and because of this, the custom in our generation developed that we let anyone who is a little familiar with kiddsuhin, [be mesader kiddushin]...In contradistinction to divorce which has many laws and relates to the stringency of permitting a married woman, a person should only deal with them if he knows etc. And similarly, with marriage that follows a divorce, regarding these, a person should only deal with them if he knows the nature of the divorce that preceded the marriage, whether it was a proper divorce, for maybe it wasn't a divorce, and he would be permitting a married woman to remarry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In summary, while it is very difficult to prove the negative; that is, that there are no requirements, the only Talmudic source AFAIK that could be interpreted as assigning formal requirements for a mesader kiddushin (an institution that incidentally probably did not even exist in the time of Hazal), is the passage in Kiddushin. As noted, the SHA explains (following Rashi) that this refers to issuing legal rulings, and the Taz clarifies that simply officiating a wedding is not included in this. Maharsha similarly implies that the requirement for expertise when dealing with marriage, only applies to remarriage, which is an extension of the expertise required for divorce. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/949661/jewish/What-is-the-function-of-a-weddings-officiating-rabbi.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad's page on What is the role and function of the officiating celebrant in a Jewish wedding?\n</a> answers your question as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The officiating rabbi at a wedding, known in Hebrew as\n  the mesader kiddushin, has two primary functions: The first and primary\n  function of the rabbi is to ensure that the entire wedding is properly\n  conducted according to Jewish law and custom. He makes sure that all\n  the \"paperwork,\" i.e. the ketubah (marriage contract), is in order;\n  that the marriage witnesses meet all halachic criteria; and that all\n  other parts of the ceremony conform to halachic standards. Secondly,\n  there is a blessing that is technically the groom's responsibility to\n  recite before placing the wedding ring on the bride's finger. Since\n  the groom will likely be too nervous at this juncture to properly\n  pronounce the blessing, the rabbi recites it in his stead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he does need to be someone who knows the relevant laws (including how to remedy problematic situations) and can make sure that the laws are fulfilled.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The accepted answer certainly presents one side of the argument.

Rather, the same is so for Kiddushin, that <strong>at the onset [someone who is not an expert should not] be mesader the Kiddushin</strong>. This is why the gemarra used the expression \"you should not have dealings [with someone who isn't an expert]\", which implies any dealings, i.e. kiddushin and gittin. Rashi as well, who says they shouldn't be a judge, didn't only mean a judge to rule on gittin or kiddushin if they were done properly, rather he also means that they shouldn't at the onset be mesader them, and this is included in being a judge. Similarly it sounds like this from Responsa Mahari Veil § 85.</p>\n  \n  <p>Definitely it wasn't for naught that <strong>these generations were accustomed to only give away the honor of mesader kiddushin with the permission of a Rav</strong>, because there are many stumbling blocks to worry about, such as forbidden relationships could get married, which happens sometimes in our generation.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Kenesses HaGedolah in a Responsa writes that <strong>it is an enactment of the French Rabbis</strong> which were in the days of Rabbeinu Tam, that they decreed that <strong>only someone who was chosen to be a Rav can be mesader kiddushin, or is a halachic decisor for a community</strong>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Even_HaEzer.49.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 49:8</a>) first brings the opinion of the Taz, and then finishes with the opinion of the Shevus Yaakov and Kenesses HaGedolah, which could indicate his preference for the latter.</p>\n\n\n",

But why would awareness of a Moshiach make a difference?</p>\n\n<p>The Abrabanel, in his <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11860&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosh Amanna ch.14</a> discusses this and gives three reasons for its inclusion in the list of principles of faith.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>As part of the reward and punishment system it is indeed a basic and necessary foundation of Jewish belief.</p></li>\n  <li><p>So much has been spoken of why bad things happen to good people and that triggers the attitude that God doesn't pay attention to the actions of this world. The concept of a rectified era of Moshiach fixes this issue.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Just the fact that the prophets have spoken so much about it makes belief in it necessary. </p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is understandable that the Torah did not emphasize it since it is not inherently a foundation of Judaism, although it is indeed important to know and believe in it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p>The Messiah is not mentioned at all. The Messianic concept is also not mentioned at all. It's hard to find sources for a non-existence in something. It's like asking if there are any radioactive ninja turtles in your lemonade, what answer can you give other than \"No.\" ? Anyways, if you read the Torah from beginning to end you will not find anything Messianic.</p>\n\n<p>Lots of people will point out that you could interpret some things to be hints for the Messiah or the Messianic age, but it's not something inherent to the plain meaning of the text.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/jewfaq/mashiach.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/jewfaq/mashiach.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

I went to a shul Seudah this past week and the MC, Mr Luchanski, brought up the question and he answered similarly for the first two tefillos. However, he phrased it that maariv reminisces about the Creation, Shacharis relates to Kabbalas HaTorah, and Mincha refers to Yemos haMashiach (when the Messiah will come). His proof was that Mincha is in the future tense. He may have also mentioned that \"shimcha echad\"(your name is One) will only occur in the future. There are difficulties with that (1) Shacharis is also in the future tense; and (2) \"Shimcha echad\" seems to be in the present tense. The first difficulty may parallel elsewhere where Moshe is referred to in the future, \"Oz yashir Moshe,\" (then Moshe WILL sing) Exodus 15/1 according to the Midrash, a \"proof\" that haShem will resurrect the dead. Of course that would mean that Chazal chose to mirror the idea by using the future tense. The Rashi and the Ramban both seek to explain that that is not the simple P'shat. And the Ramban states \"it is the way of the [Scriptural] language to speak in the future instead of the past.\"\nAs for \"Shimcha echad,\" the idea that that refers specifically to the future was hinted in the prophecy of Ovadiah, read for last week's Haftarah. Saviors will...judge the mountain of Eisav, [then] the Kingdom will belong to HaShem.\"<br>\nWe quote this verse daily, after saying \"Oz yashir Moshe\" and we add a verse from Zecharia, (14/9) \"On that day, haShem will be One and His Name (shimcha) will be One.\" One could say that haShem is One and His name is One, even now, by virtue of the Jewish people accepting Him!

    "content": "# How can we say women can't receive s'micha when they already have?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The topic of s'micha is a touchy subject in general due to the fact that the s'micha we have now is a rather diminished form in comparison to the s'micha of the Bible or Talmud.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The institution of semicha was introduced to the Jewish people when Hashem commanded\n  Moshe to designate Yehoshua as his successor by placing his hands on his disciple’s head\n  (Bamidbar 27:23). The Gemara (Sanhedrin 13b) comments that from that time on, semicha is\n  no longer given in this manner, but rather through a declaration, by a teacher calling his student\n  “rebbe” and giving him permission to impose fines ordained by the Torah. That same passage\n  also informs us that we no longer have the concept of genuine semicha in our days. The\n  transmission of semicha must be done by someone who himself received semicha through a\n  continuous chain dating back to Moshe Rabbeinu. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2014/1053/Purim_To-Go_-_5774_Rabbi_Schachter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://download.yutorah.org/2014/1053/Purim_To-Go_-_5774_Rabbi_Schachter.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>When bringing up the subject of women having s'micha, things get even touchier. Emotions can run hot and bold statements are regularly made. <a href=\"/a/45077\">Here is an example of what is said when the topic of women receiving s'micha is brought up</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Hershel Shachter intimates that , since certain non-masoretic\n  groups ordain women as rabbis, it is a violation on the level of\n  \"yeharag v'lo yaavor\" (i.e. one must give up ones life, rather than\n  trangress) to give Orthodox smicha to women.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>...we encourage one to give up his life in order to secure the continuation of the chain of semichah from the days of Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Rav Shachter goes on to explain that, although smicha today isn't the\n  same as Biblical smicha, it is considered an extension of it, and\n  thus, must conform to the same standards. Anyone who gives smicha\n  outside of those standards, threatens the very existence of masoretic\n  (i.e. halachically observant) Judaism.</p>\n  \n  <p>“RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain\n  women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or\n  hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an\n  Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to\n  be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/2015/11/01/news-opinion/united-states/rabbinical-council-of-america-officially-bans-ordination-and-hiring-of-women-rabbis\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jta.org/2015/11/01/news-opinion/united-states/rabbinical-council-of-america-officially-bans-ordination-and-hiring-of-women-rabbis</a></p>\n\n<p>So while even though it is an established fact that the s'micha we have now is a diminished form, there are those saying that people should give up their lives rather than let a woman receive this s'micha. But what doesn't make sense about these ideas, is that women had already received the higher form of s'micha in times past, and we have no Biblical record of anyone objecting to it then, so why should it be different now?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Judges Chapter 4</p>\n  \n  <p>ד  וּדְבוֹרָה אִשָּׁה נְבִיאָה, אֵשֶׁת לַפִּידוֹת--הִיא שֹׁפְטָה\n  אֶת-יִשְׂרָאֵל, בָּעֵת הַהִיא.‏<br>\n  4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife\n  of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.<br>\n  ה  וְהִיא יוֹשֶׁבֶת\n  תַּחַת-תֹּמֶר דְּבוֹרָה, בֵּין הָרָמָה וּבֵין בֵּית-אֵל--בְּהַר\n  אֶפְרָיִם; וַיַּעֲלוּ אֵלֶיהָ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, לַמִּשְׁפָּט.‏<br>\n    5 And\n  she sat under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in\n  the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her\n  for judgment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do we know she received s'micha?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pirkei Avot Ch. 1</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>Moses received the Torah from Sinai and gave it over to Joshua. Joshua gave it over to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets gave it over to the Men of the Great Assembly. They [the Men of the Great Assembly] would always say these three things: Be cautious in judgement. Establish many pupils. And make a safety fence around the Torah.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Deborah was a prophetess after the time of Joshua, and a judge of the people, it would be inconceivable that she did not receive s'micha. And for those wondering why it would be inconceivable that she did nto have s'micha, consider the following prooftext used to justify the authority of the Rabbis</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ח  כִּי יִפָּלֵא מִמְּךָ דָבָר לַמִּשְׁפָּט, בֵּין-דָּם לְדָם בֵּין-דִּין לְדִין וּבֵין נֶגַע לָנֶגַע--דִּבְרֵי רִיבֹת, בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ:  וְקַמְתָּ וְעָלִיתָ--אֶל-הַמָּקוֹם, אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ בּוֹ.   8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, even matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose.\n  ט  וּבָאתָ, אֶל-הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם, וְאֶל-הַ<strong>שֹּׁפֵט, אֲ</strong>שֶׁר יִהְיֶה בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם; וְדָרַשְׁתָּ וְהִגִּידוּ לְךָ, אֵת דְּבַר הַמִּשְׁפָּט.   9 And thou shall come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the <strong>judge</strong> that shall be in those days; and thou shalt inquire; and they shall declare unto thee the sentence of judgment.\n  י  וְעָשִׂיתָ, עַל-פִּי הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ, מִן-הַמָּקוֹם הַהוּא, אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהוָה; וְשָׁמַרְתָּ לַעֲשׂוֹת, כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ.    10 And thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall declare unto thee from that place which the LORD shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01625.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01625.html</a></p>\n\n<p>If the Rabbi's get their authority from this verse, with their authority being based on having received s'micha (afterall in todays world, no s'micha, no Rabbi), then Deborah clearly receives the same authority since she is a Biblical judge. And there is no Biblical record of anyone objecting to her status as a judge, even though we have many instances of people objecting to Moshe's leadership/status in the Torah. And more than likely she was not the only woman who received s'micha</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2 Kings 22</p>\n  \n  <p>יד  וַיֵּלֶךְ חִלְקִיָּהוּ הַכֹּהֵן וַאֲחִיקָם וְעַכְבּוֹר וְשָׁפָן וַעֲשָׂיָה, אֶל-חֻלְדָּה הַנְּבִיאָה אֵשֶׁת שַׁלֻּם בֶּן-תִּקְוָה בֶּן-חַרְחַס שֹׁמֵר הַבְּגָדִים, וְהִיא יֹשֶׁבֶת בִּירוּשָׁלִַם, בַּמִּשְׁנֶה; וַיְדַבְּרוּ, אֵלֶיהָ.‏<br>\n  14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe--now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter--and they spoke with her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Chuldah was another established prophetess, one whom kings would inquire of, it would also be really odd if she had not received s'micha considering she was sought after.</p>\n\n<p>How do we reconcile the modern statements that women can't receive something they already had?

In your question you state, \"Since Deborah was a prophetess after the time of Joshua, and a judge of the people, it would be inconceivable that she did not receive s'micha.\" That's a pretty strong statement. I strongly doubt that \"the Elders to the Prophets\" means <em>all</em> of the prophets. The gemara says there were a huge number of prophets who were not recorded in Tanakh and there is little reason to believe they all received semicha. Even if Deborah <em>did</em> receive formal semicha, you couldn't learn a <em>kal v'chomer</em> from her to modern women <em>because</em> she was a prophet.</p>\n\n<p>So let me go back and specifically address your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How do we reconcile the modern statements that women can't receive something they already had?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your proof that Deborah received semicha doesn't hold up, as shown above.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Especially given the fact that the thing they received is greater than what is possible now?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an attempt at a <em>kal v'chomer</em> but it doesn't hold up because Deborah was a prophet so even if she <em>did</em> have semicha, the <em>kal v'chomer</em> could only apply to today's female prophets of whom there are currently (unfortunately) none.</p>\n\n\n",

Instead, he can treif it up on purpose, and then kasher it and use it for milchig.

This is based on an idea that is found mainly in the <strong>חכם צבי</strong>.  The halacha is that after 24 hours it is מותר to use a meat pot for dairy on the level of דאורייתא, but the דרבנן disallowed it.  The <strong>חכם צבי</strong> says that this גזירה only applies through 12 months (he bases this on a גמרא regarding סתם יינם, which says that any barrel that was אסור due to having had סתם יינם inside it can be used after 12 months, because whatever טעם that was inside it has disappeared.  He says that this proves to us that טעם disappears after 12 months, and the same holds true for the טעם of meat or dairy in כלים as well). The <strong>מהרש\"ם</strong> says that even though we do not rely on the חכם צבי to use dishes after a year as though they have lost their old status, we will rely on him to kasher from milchig to fleishig after a year.  Rabbi Sobolofky, Rosh Yeshiva in Yeshiva University, felt that one has the right to follow this מנהג of the מהרש\"ם, to wait a year and then kasher לכתחילה.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>It comes out from these sources that that since the whole reason for the tradition brought down in the רמ\"א was it would cause the mixing up of dairy and meat dishes, so when dealing with a Non-Kosher dishes the פרי מגדים felt you are allowed to Kasher right away.</strong></p>\n<p>It must be noted that these rules are only true for dishes that are able to be Kashered.

First it mentions <em>Yitzhak</em>'s father, and then it switches back to story-telling mode to tell about the births of <em>Yitzhak</em>'s sons instead of giving a long list of descendants.</p>\n<p>Why does the Torah stray from it's normal MO of listing a long chain of descendants?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I talk about the meaning of <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2013_02_01_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">toldos</a></p>\n\n<p>as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The use of \"Eilah Toldos\", which is usually translated as \"These are\n  the generations\" or \"these are the products\" is found only in sefer\n  Breishis (except for one case in Sefer Bamidbar 3:1) and only at the\n  nodal points of an era. Each time it appears, it marks the end of an\n  era and the beginning of a new one. The initial statement \"Eilah\n  Toldos\" gives the name of the \"person\" at the cusp of the node, points\n  to what has triggered the new era and is followed by a summary of what\n  will be the significance of that era up to its end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.\n.\n.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He has two sons, Yishmael and Yitzchak. They are regarded as two\n  separate streams of humanity and will therefore be considered the\n  branching point. That is why we have Lech Lecha 25:12 and Toldos\n  25:19.</p>\n  \n  <p>יב. וְאֵלֶּה תֹּלְדֹת יִשְׁמָעֵאל בֶּן אַבְרָהָם אֲשֶׁר יָלְדָה הָגָר הַמִּצְרִית שִׁפְחַת שָׂרָה לְאַבְרָהָם:</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"12\">\n  <li><p>Now these are the generations of Ishmael the son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, the maidservant of Sarah, bore to Abraham.</p>\n  \n  <p>יט. וְאֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹת יִצְחָק בֶּן אַבְרָהָם אַבְרָהָם הוֹלִיד אֶת יִצְחָק:</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"19\">\n  <li>And these are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham; Abraham begot Isaac.</li>\n  </ol></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Each one starts a completely different line of history. Just as the\n  Torah drops the sons of Noach to follow Shem, and the children of Shem\n  to follow Terach, we now end the summary of Yishmael with the\n  indication that his descendants have their own history and we follow\n  Yitzchak. Avraham was an individual. Yitzchak and Yishmael create\n  families that will become nations. It is Yitzchak who is regarded as\n  the true heir of Avraham and who we will follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus Yitzchak as the transitional connection between Terach and Yaakov is listed with his most significant trait. This is not that he gave birth to Ya'akov and Eisav, but that he continued and strengthened the line of Avraham by \"purging\" the traits exemplified by Yishmael. He wove the gevurah of his mother with the chesed of his father into the second of the \"three fold string\"</p>\n\n<p>Rav Munk in The Call of Torah\" goes into this and points out the difference between Yishmael and Yitzchak.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that the children of Keturah are mentioned and then dropped. They are not a תּוֹלְדֹת but continue on just like the remainder of the nations.</p>\n\n<p>We continue with Yaakov as a node and a start of a line himself, purging the bad traits of Eisav and creating the third element of the \"three fold cord\" that can no loger be broken.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>On that Pasuk, Rashi writes, \"על ידי שכתב הכתוב יצחק בן אברהם הוזקק לומר אברהם הוליד את יצחק, לפי שהיו ליצני הדור אומרים מאבימלך נתעברה שרה, שהרי כמה שנים שהתה עם אברהם ולא נתעברה הימנו, מה עשה הקב\"ה, צר קלסתר פניו של יצחק דומה לאברהם, והעידו הכל אברהם הוליד את יצחק, וזהו שכתב כאן יצחק בן אברהם היה, שהרי עדות יש שאברהם הוליד את יצחק:\" Rashi gives two explanations. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Only after Hashem named Avram Avraham, he had Yitzchak.</p></li>\n<li><p>People might have doubted that Yitzchak was Avraham's son because only after Sarah was taken by Avimelech that she had a baby.

If an emergency occurred on Shabbat, they have one that they can use, but, having both available obviously, makes things more efficient. as it's certainly possible to have multiple emergencies at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>One ambulance broke down just before Shabbat. The Jew brings the ambulance to the Gentile mechanic and tells him, \"I need you to fix this on Shabbat, and call me as soon as you can, because we need it pronto.\"</p>\n\n<p>Is this a \"life threatening\" situation exemption that would allow the Gentile to do the work? Furthermore, when the ambulance is fixed, can another Jewish Hatzalah member drive someone on Shabbat to the mechanic so that he can get the ambulance?</p>\n\n<p><strong>To ponder:</strong> At the moment, no life threatening situation exists (not even a doubtful one). But, an ambulance needs to always be ready.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1447&pgnum=221\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noda Beyehuda (YO\"D 210)</a> writes that one may not dissect a Jewish corpse (which is forbidden) in order to discover the cause of death, even if it is the only way to uncover information that will help save lives in the future. He explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל בנידון דידן <strong>אין כאן שום חולה</strong> <strong>הצריך</strong> לזה רק שרוצים ללמוד חכמה זו אולי יזגמן חולה שיהיה צריך לזה, <strong>ודאי דלא דחינן משום חששא קלה זו שום איסור תורה או אפי׳ איסור דרבנן</strong>, שאם אתה קורא לחששא זו ספק נפשות א״כ יהיה כל מלאכת הרפואות שחיקת ובישול סמנים והכנת כלי איזמל להקזה מותר בשבת שמא יזדמן היום או בלילה חולה שיהיה צורך לזה... וחלילה להתיר דבר זה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, unless there is a חולה who needs it, one cannot transgress any prohibition - even one of Rabbinic origin - on the off chance that it may save lives later.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1839&pgnum=275\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y\"D 336</a>) and Binyan Tzion (V1, §137) rules the same. (See also similar ruling in Shu\"t R' Akiva Eiger §60, although marginally different)</p>\n\n<p>[This may be the explanation why we are not <em>obligated</em> to all become doctors and learn emergency first aid, although this could potentially lead to saving lives in the future.]</p>\n\n<p>However, the Chazon Ish (Y\"D 207.6) writes that the deciding factor is not whether there is an existing חולה, but whether there is a reasonable belief that the action will save lives, and not just the 'off chance':</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בפ\"ת סי' שס\"ג בשם הנו\"ב והח\"ס דאם יש חולה קמן מותר לנוולו משום פ\"נ אבל\n  אין חולה קמן אסור, <strong>ואין החילוק בין איתא קמן לליתא קמן</strong>, אלא <strong>אם מצוי\n  הדבר דבזמן שמתריעין עלה</strong> [אף שאין בשעה חולה קמן] משום חולי מהלכת הו\"ל\n  כאויבים שצרו בעיר הסמוך לכפר וכדאמר בעירובין מ\"ה א' ובתענית כ\"א ב',\n  ומיהו בשעת שלו' לא חשבינן ליה פ\"נ אע\"ג דשכיח בזמן מן הזמנים שיצטרכו\n  לזה כמו שאין עושין כלי זיין בשבת בשעת שלו' דא\"כ בטלת כל המצות, <strong>אלא לא\n  מקרי ספק פ\"נ בדברים עתידים שבהוה אין להם כל זכר</strong>, ובאמת שאין אנו בקיאים\n  בעתידיות, ופעמים שמה שחשבונם להצלה מתהפך לרועץ, והלכך אין דנים בשביל\n  עתידות רחוקות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, if there is a likelihood that the ambulance would be needed, one would be allowed to do anything necessary to make that possible.</p>\n\n<p>(See also Shu\"t Machane Chaim [V2 Y\"D §60], who writes that the Chasam Sofer and Node Beyehuda were talking specifically about dissecting bodies because of the severity of <em>kovod hames</em>, but would not say this by other prohibitions. In his words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רק ניכר כונת הנוב\"י שחשש פן יחתכו כל המתים ללמוד מהם וגם ניכר כונת\n  אדמו\"ר (החת\"ס) כי חשש על דברי הרמב\"ן קללת אלקים תלוי וכו)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are numerous sources where we find dispensations in Halacha משום שלום מלכות, although there was no specific סכנה yet. (See B\"K 83a & Beis Yosef YD 178; Rambam Hil. Korban Pesach 3:1 and Kesef Mishne; Sanhedrin 26a [Tos. <em>misherabu</em>])</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> According to the <em>pashtus</em> of the Node Beyhuda and Chasam Sofer, it would be forbidden to do something for a future <em>sakanah</em>. However, the Chazon Ish explains that if there is a strong likelihood that this action will help save future lives, it is permitted. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Even according to the Noda B'Yehuda, he uses the term chashasha kala, which implies that he agrees with the Chazon Ish.</p>\n\n\n",

Like the \"sleep\" you do at your work desk, sometimes. (Of course, it's not specifically YOU :-)</p>\n\n<p>The point is, that David is emphasizing that G-d always watches Israel and doesn't even take this \"lighter\" sleep. He's always awake watching us.

A human even if he does not doze as a result of tiredness he is still forced to sleep and they then put another guard instead of him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Malbim explains that Hashem who constantly guards Israel does not slumber due to fatigue and the like, and nor does He sleep naturally. Rather He is always there watching over us and never needs replacing like that of a human guard. (See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.5.27?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_Isaiah.5.27.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> and his comment on Yeshaya 5:27 where the same words are used).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.54a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 54a</a> it helps to provide a clear definition of this word ינום.

If Noah's ark landed about 4000 years ago in what is now Turkey, how could some land animals get to places such as Australia or other islands? How can there be kangaroos in Australia, elephants in Sri Lanka, and bears in Japan? I know there must be an explanation, but this is really confusing and puzzling.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The entire survival and spread of people and animals after they left the ark was by a miracle. For example, there was not enough of any species in the ark to allow for a critical mass for the next generation to survive. Consider the passenger pigeon which became extinct when the flock size dropped below the millions within historical times. Thus, both the survival and the spread to the rest of the world was by a miracle. See also the posts on this site about the food required that was available only by a miracle. As soon as a meat eating animal would have eaten a pig, the entire species would have disappeared had they not first built up a full population miraculously.</p>\n\n\n",

Traditionally, the tetragramaton was pronounced (with its real pronunciation, I mean) by the <em>kohein gadol</em> (high priest) on Yom Yippur, but this was a special occasion.  Otherwise, while it's possible that early Jews might have pronounced the name, by the time of the talmud (according to <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/jewfaq/name.htm\">Mechon Mamre</a>, which doesn't give a specific citation) the rabbis called for substituting a different reference.  I was taught that this is to avoid accidentally misusing the divine name.</p>\n\n<p>In conversation today you will hear Jews say \"Hashem\" (literally \"the name\") instead, or in English you'll sometimes hear \"the Lord\".  In prayer and torah reading we use the form \"Ado-nai\", which means \"my lord\".  In a <em>tikkun</em> (the book used to prepare torah reading) you'll see the tetragramaton with the vowels from \"Ado...\" as a reminder to the torah reader.</p>\n\n<p>See some further information <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton#Verbal_prohibitions\">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Hebrew word אדני can actually be pointed in three distinct ways:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(1) אֲדֹנִי adoni,\n(2) אֲדֹנַי adonai, and\n(3) אֲדֹנָי adonai.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All three forms can be used as terms of address; the first one is singular and has the possessive suffix “my” added to it. The second form is the plural, again with the possessive suffix “my” added to it, and is best translated as “Gentlemen!” or “Sirs!” The third form is very special and is used exclusively for addressing G-d (in prayer); non-Jews can find this confusing, because it is pronounced in exactly the same manner as the second form. Furthermore, the third form is also how the Tetragrammaton is vocalized—it cannot be read as written because it consists only of consonants and has no vowels, and (despite christian claims that this usage is post-Biblical), we find that Abraham uses it to address God in B'réshıt 18:3, 18:27 and 18:31, as does King Avimelech in B'réshıt / Genesis 20:4</p>\n\n\n",

(Rashi, on second Parsha, Deut/11/13).  The question is asked, (I think it is brought earlier, but I just found it quoted in Artscroll from Maskil L'David), \"Why does it say you must dedicate 3 things [\"all your heart, all your life and all your resources\"] in the first and only 2 in the 2nd[leaving out \"resources\"]? The answer given (I think it was said by earlier sources but Artscroll attributes the answer to Maskil L'David), \"Only an individual needs to be warned to [also] give up resources, since there are yechidim who would be foolish enough to think twice if someone said 'your money or your life.' A tzibbur would not and therefore needs not be warned, once it has been warned to give up its lives.\" </p>\n\n<p>Now, we need to see why each time the second Parsha switches away from plural, which is the given, to singular. I have put a lot of thought into this and only found One or two sources that supports part of my meanderings. First we must posit: is there a connection between the 3 things and tefillin and mezuzah, which follow, in the first Parsha? It seems that each of these Mitzvos are a way to help us out with the 3 things mentioned. (1) we wear a tefillah on our arm, near the Heart, to strengthen our resolve to sacrifice our heart for haShem. (2) We wear another tefillah on our head, near our brain, which controls our Life, to strengthen our resolve to sacrifice our life. (3) what, then, would be the best way to strengthen our resolve to sacrifice our resources? By putting on a mezuzah to dedicate our most dear, expensive resource, ie our Home! I searched all over and finally found this in \"Emes L'Yaakov\" by Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky, who quotes \"Talmidei d'Rabbeinu Yonah\" that say this! </p>\n\n<p>According to this comment, we would like to refine our question: \"If the Maskil L'David is correct, why is there a need at all, according to the Talmidei d'Rabbeinu Yonah, to mention mezuzos in the second paragraph? Mezuzos are given to strengthen a weakness of valuing money over life! And that, according to TDR\"Y, is not necessary in the public sector! Can these two commentaries be merged into one?\" \nNow, with that intro, let's look at the second Parsha. </p>\n\n<p>The Second Parsha is known as the Parsha of Kibul Sachar (receiving reward) for following the Mitzvos. It starts off by announcing that, if the tzibbur follows \"with [all of] your hearts and [all of] your lives, then I will give the precipitation of your [community's] land in its appropriate time, early 'shooting' [Strong] rain as well as late [gentle] rain.\" </p>\n\n<p>The narrative now switches to the singular to stress and ensure us that this will not be a communal bracha, possibly leaving some to beg from others better blessed, rather it will be a bracha that is bestowed upon each and every individual!</p>\n\n<p>\"...and [each of ] you will collect your [individual] grain, your [individual] old wine, your [individual] olive oil.\" And \"I shall give herbage in your [individual] field for your farm animals; [afterwards], you shall [each, individually,] eat and be satisfied!\" </p>\n\n<p>So, although the rains come down to the whole land, the bracha is sent individually!</p>\n\n<p>Now the narrative returns to reinforce that we are talking about the whole tzibbur:\n\"Be forewarned for yourselves, lest he sway your hearts and all of you will turn away and you will all serve other gods/forces, and you will all prostrate yourselves to them. \nThen the anger of haShem will be heated against all of you (Chas v'shalom!) and He will withhold the Heavens and there will be no precipitation and the Land will not give forth its produce. And you will all be lost quickly from being on the Land which haShem is giving to all of you.\nTherefore, [to strengthen your resolve], all of you shall put these, my words, upon [each of] your hearts and upon your life forces, [BY] tying, [all of] you, them (these words) for a sign [to strengthen your resolve to give over your hearts] upon your [arms, near your hearts] and they (these words) shall (also) be for reminders [on your brain, which is your life force].</p>\n\n<p>(Btw, I found that the Baal haTanya says similarly in the Shulchan Aruch haRav)</p>\n\n<p>Now we have another switch, mid-posuk, from plural to singular.\n\"And [all of] you shall teach them (these directives) [to] [all of] your children to speak with them [ and to show your commitment, you may not depend on the tzibbur to transmit these directives to your children, rather EACH OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY shall teach them, with [each of] your sitting in your [individual] home, and while you are [each on] your [individual] path, and when you [each] lie down and when you [each] get up.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now since, when discussing teaching the tradition to our personal children, we have stressed the individual's PERSONAL responsibility to teach, we have returned to a situation when we can no longer depend on the tzibbur. We've returned to a situation when an individual might transmit the [wrong] message to his children that we should give up our hearts and lives but perhaps NOT our resources. Therefore, we now state in the singular, \"And you shall [each] write them (these words) on the mezuzos of your [individual] house and [individual] gateway.\"\n(l'ma'an) If you do so, teaching each of your children to give over heart, life, and resources, to haShem, then (yirbu y'meichem...), ALL OF your days and the days of ALL OF your sons will be increased on the Land which haShem, the Powerful G-d of ALL OF you, has sworn to give to you like the days of the Heavens on the Earth!\"</p>\n\n\n",

With more details: Yalkut Shimoni on\n  Shemot, remez 168.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Midrash fills in the gap with the following fascinating account:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bilam was advisor to the king of Kush (Ethiopia) and rebelled and took over his city while he was fighting foreign rebels. Nine years after the king returned and started trying to retake the city, he died and Moshe was appointed king.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moses was crowned king of Kush, and was also given the young widow of\n  King Kinkos as a wife. However, since she was a descendant of Canaan,\n  with whom marriage was prohibited to Abraham’s descendants, he was\n  never intimate with her.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moses remained there as king for forty full years, and during this\n  period the nation prospered greatly. But the queen was unhappy. She\n  approached the supreme council of Kush and said, “What have you done\n  to me? I am the royal queen, but the king never even touches me.\n  Moreover, he does not believe in our gods. A king should have the same\n  religion as his subjects. Kinkos’ son is now mature, and he is\n  experienced in running the government. It is time for him to be\n  appointed king.”</p>\n  \n  <p>The council heard her plea and agreed with her argument. The next day\n  they voted to crown Kinkos’s son as king. Swearing that they would do\n  him no harm, the council approached Moses and explained the situation.\n  They gave him many gifts and sent him off with great honor, befitting\n  a former king. Moses thus left Kush and settled in Midian.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The accounts of Moses going to Cush tend to vary and are a bit problematic. If you say that Moses went to Cush after murdering the Egyptian, he would not have had enough time to really settle a family with Zipporah in Midian. So of all the stories regarding Moses and Cush, the most \"believable version\" are the ones cited by Josephus and the Quran which state that while Moses was prince of Egypt he conquered Cush, married the queen (which then solves the issue of the \"Cushite wife\" in Numbers), and eventually went back to Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the simplest answer to your question is probably the correct one. Moses became great because Jethro taught him to be. There is a hint to how this would be possible in Genesis Rabbah, though it is contradicted in other midrashim (actually all the midrashim on account of Jethro contradict each other)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is further said (Exodus Rabba l.c.) that Jethro, having remarked that the worship of an idol was foolish, abandoned it.[1] The Midianites therefore excommunicated him, and none would keep his flocks; so that his daughters were compelled to tend them and were ill-treated by the shepherds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8620-jethro#1035\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8620-jethro#1035</a></p>\n\n<p>If Jethro had become a monotheist, and was willing to give up being the head priest of the nation of Midian, he would be the best candidate to help Moses become great. And would explain why Moses continued to hold him in such high regard throughout the rest of the Torah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are no specific references to what Moshe Rabbeinu did from the time he fled Egypt to the time he arrived in Midian. However, there are those (such as Nechama Leibowitz) who discuss the three incidents which show his midos.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>He sees an Egyptian beating a \"Jew\" and steps in to protect the \"Jew\". This, however, could mean that he was trying to take advantage of his position and the \"grandson\" of Par'o to defend someone from the people of his origin.</p></li>\n<li><p>He sees two \"Jews\" fighting and steps in to separate them. Here again there could be an explanation since he is stepping in to prevent a dispute among his own people.</p></li>\n<li><p>He steps in to defend gentiles (the daughters of Yisro) from other gentiles (the shepherds. Here we see that he cannot restrain himself from attempting to enforce justice no matter who the two patters are and which one is in the wrong.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We see from the fact that after he marries Tziporah that he is still taking care of Yisro's sheep with no attempt to build a flock for himself (as with Lavan and Yaakov) that he does not care for position or money. It is these midos that cause Hashem to cal;l on him to lead the Bnei Yisral and free them. </p>\n\n<p>While he was probably taught by his family (since he knew Aharon was his brother and the leader of Klal Yisrael), he did not have the time to learn all the knowledge that Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov did.. He had to flee Egypt almost as soon as he \"went out to his brothers\".</p>\n\n<p>Knowledge can be taught (as Moshe was taught during the 40 day on Sinai), but it is midos that allow someone to rise to greatness.</p>\n\n\n",

Often when something in Judaism is portrayed in a negative way it is a result of not really understanding what the Torah is saying. This is often as a result of something similar in another religion but enforced for a different reason. </p>\n\n<p>For example in Islam the reason women must cover themselves up is b/c men can't control themselves and might be cause to rape them or think impure thoughts. At one point in America it was acceptable to think concern a woman who was sexually assaulted to say well look what she was wearing she was asking for it.</p>\n\n<p>In Judaism the reason for modesty has nothing to do with the behavior of men who act badly but about the holiness associated with the behavior of being modest and having an internal connection to Gd. A big aspect of how women serve G-d according to Torah is from a deeper more internal way. This is unlike men who need to have outward signs such as a yarmulka (yire malka the fear of the king, tzitzis, tefillin, etc)</p>\n\n<p>Rather than deny something in the Torah, there is an opportunity to correct a mistaken opinion causing a kiddush Hashem and \"is honorable to himself and brings him honor from man\" (P.A. ch 2 paragraph 1)</p>\n\n\n",

(As in, 'I told you, not once, not twice, but <strong>three times!</strong>') Some prayers are repeated three times for this effect.</p>\n\n<p>One thing must be clear, though. In Judaism there is never such a thing as having something represent Hashem. We see in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0220.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shmos 20:18-19</a> that Hashem says that now that we've seen how He spoke we should never make anything to represent Him.

Picture the TV character who has a tough decision to make -- a little angel version of himself appears on one shoulder, a little devil on the other. Altogether, three copies of the same face.</p>\n\n<p>This is because whenever we feel torn in decision, we \"hear\" three voices -- A, B and the decider. Freud identified A and B as the Id and Superego, with the Ego in the driver's seat. Eric Berne (Transactional Analysis) had Parent-Adult-Child.</p>\n\n<p>In Judaism, the Sefer haYetzirah identifies three aspect / categories of function of the soul. And from there, and Bereishis Rabba (5th cent CE) it reached both rationalists (such as Rav Saadia Gaon) and the Qabbalists. More about that at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/63814/1570\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/63814/1570</a> , so I see no need to repeat here.</p>\n\n<p>(I would suggest that Freud, lacking belief in heaven and souls, could not believe in a neshamah having cravings for the spiritual as inherent as the body's -- really, the nefesh's -- cravings for sex, food, and other physical comforts. He therefore conceived of these drives inhering in a need to conform to one's social context, the Superego.)</p>\n\n<p>Rav Saadia Gaon (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/kapah/2a-2.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Emunos veDei'os 2:4</a>) says that our perceptions of G-d as \"Living\", Omniscient and Omnipotent led to the Christian trinity.

Alternatively, it is so that people\nwon’t think that this is actual techeiles.</p>\n<p>Peri Megadim explains that although a talis should be the same color\nas the strings, the stripes do not constitute a problem, because we\nfollow the principle color of the garment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that nowadays people can wear differently colored stripes without a problem and that the colors do not have significance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Joods by Schilderij Voerman, 1884</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SZfeD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SZfeD.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Some sources say that the blue stripes were a reminder of Yosef's coat.

My answer is going to based upon the assumption you are referring to the exile following the second beis hamikdash until today with a story about the vilna goan...</p>\n\n<p>the gra was known for his stance that he did not pasken halachos for individuals. in thebuilding where the gra lived there was a another Jewish family. The woman of the house was preparing for shabbos and accidentally used a dairy spoon to mix her chicken soup. She became very nervous and had her husband leave as soojn as he stepped in the door to go ask the local rav if they could still eat the soup. Her husband had bee taking some time and the woman was getting anxious. She walked ustairs to see of the gra would be able to help her. After explaining her situation to his wife the gra agreed to see her andd told her the sou was not kosher. Upon hearing this she was releived and went downstairs to get rid of the soup. upon getting to her apartment her husband came home. Her husbnadreported the soup was ok but to kasher the spoon. Now the woman was worried she already got an answer that said it was not okay. The woman again become worried and hurried ustairs to ask the gra what to do. He said if the rav said it's ok then it is kosher and to prove that I accept his decision I'm going to come down and have a bowl of sou with your family. Upon the gra getting to her living quarters she became nervous with the vilna goan in her house and droped the soup. Before she had anything to say the gra preempted her by saying you have nothing to worry about. Don't think that you dropping the soup was in any fashion some sort of divine will because I had rled before it wasn't kosher rather you were nervious and that what your local rav said is halacha today just as much as what a king would have degreed. Today we don't have amelech but the decisions of a rav within that community carry the weight of legal authority within the Jewish community. </p>\n\n\n",

Thus Yitzchak died 10 years before Yaakov met Par'o. Since Yosef was missing for 22 years, Yitzchak died after Yosef had been missing for 12 years. Yosef was sold at age 17 and appointed at age 30 (13 years). Thus Yitzchak died the year before Yosef was appointed. Note that the meforshim say that the famine ended (early) when Yaakov came and blessed Par'o and Mitzrayim.

And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.’ And the people of Nineveh believed G-d; and they proclaimed a fast, and […] And [the king] caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; […] Who knoweth whether G-d will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do such extended fasts work?</p>\n\n<p>I've met many people who aren't able to completely fast for even 25 hours or so for Yom Kippur. Is it just a matter of motivation — that the people of Shushan and of Nineveh were more afraid during these events than we are on Yom Kippur? Or did Hashem lend them strength to continue fasting? Or something else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14191&st=&pgnum=155\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maharal in Ohr Chadash</a> (on Megillas Esther) it means that you fast at the end of the first day, the whole 24 hours of the second day and a part of the third.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't see (in my Lublin-style <em>Mikraos G'dolos</em>) any commentary note how many days the Nineveh folks fasted.

(That's what I'd do if an announcement were made in the king's name that everyone must fast, with no duration specified.)</p>\n\n<p>The Esther fast is of course harder to explain that way: it says it was to last \"three days, night and day\". But it was only three days: the <em>Bavli</em>, <em>Y'vamos</em> 121 <em>amud</em> 2, says that there was no miracle in their surviving this 72-hour fast.</p>\n\n\n",

Art Scroll uses \"Nonetheless\" as the translation which has the same implication as Chabad.org.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יט וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֲבָל שָׂרָה אִשְׁתְּךָ יֹלֶדֶת לְךָ בֵּן\n  וְקָרָאתָ אֶת שְׁמוֹ יִצְחָק וַהֲקִמֹתִי אֶת בְּרִיתִי אִתּוֹ לִבְרִית\n  עוֹלָם לְזַרְעוֹ אַחֲרָיו:</p>\n  \n  <p>19 And God said, \"Indeed, your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you\n  shall name him Isaac, and I will establish My covenant with him as an\n  everlasting covenant for his seed after him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indeed: אֲבָל is an expression of a confirmation of a statement, and\n  likewise (below 42:21): “Indeed (אֲבָל), we are guilty”; (II Kings\n  4:14): “Indeed (אֲבָל), she has no son.” - [from Targumim]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, Rav Hirsch says that it means:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So here, too, \"not so\", the way Avraham wished that the future of\n  Yishmael might develop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, in either case, no matter what might happen in the future, Yishmael will not be the heir of Avraham. Yitzchak will be the <strong>only</strong> heir.</p>\n\n<p>In 17:21, I checked Chabad.org, Art Scroll, Rav Hirsch, and Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan and did not find an alternative to \"But\". I suppose that \"As far as\" or \"regarding\" might be a possible alternative. However, Rashi (above) and other meforshim state that this also connotes that the covenant applies only to Yitzchak.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The basic translation of אבל is 'but'. However, it is also used, as Rashi says, as 'really'. It is the same word and the same literal meaning. The function of 'but' in this context is used to mean 'really'. In the language of Mishna we have the same thing: ברם זכור אותו איש לטוב, <em>but</em> this person should be remembered for good. <em>But</em>, as in, <em>and how</em>. In fact, in Yiddish we do the same. א מלמד, אָבֶּער א מלמד.</p>\n\n<p>As for ואת, we must realize that Hebrew, especially biblical Hebrew, is not English. Every language has its own usage. In biblical Hebrew, the 'and' is often used in the beginning of a statement. Although the closest translation of the <em>vav</em> is <em>and</em>, it is not completely the same. The book of Shemos (Exodus) begins with a <em>vav</em>. It is a hook, saying, I mentioned first part, here is the second part.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, after completing the statement about Yishmael, the next verse begins with <em>And Yitzchok</em>, which in this case, of beginning the statement, it read as <em>and on the other hand, Yitzchok</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We must always remember not to take translations for granted. For example, we have the <em>lamed</em> prefix which is often translated as 'to'. However, as is evident in many places, it can also mean 'regarding'. It is not a different meaning. It is a pointer. Often it will mean 'he said <em>to</em> her', but it can also mean 'he said <em>of</em> her'.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is 'send, you shall send'. This is the famous biblical syntax for emphasis. In English we would say 'you shall surely send'.</p>\n\n\n",

So, his translation is consistent with your second option.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Zvi_Yehuda_Berlin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ha'amek</a> Davar <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.17.21?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">elaborates</a>, consistent with that translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל את בריתי להיות מושגח בפרטות. ושיגלה כבוד ה׳ לעמים יהיה עם יצחק</p>\n<p>But My covenant, to supervise in particular, and to reveal the honor of God to the nations, will be with Yitzchak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>My translation of the Ha'amek Davar</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is translation #2, confirnming that the word את is used as a direct object marker. I will give you a few verses, so that you can see why this translation makes the most sense:</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 17:19-21:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים אֲבָל֙ שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתְּךָ֗ יֹלֶ֤דֶת לְךָ֙ בֵּ֔ן\n  וְקָרָ֥אתָ אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ יִצְחָ֑ק וַהֲקִמֹתִ֨י <strong>אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֥י</strong> אִתּ֛וֹ\n  לִבְרִ֥ית עוֹלָ֖ם לְזַרְע֥וֹ אַחֲרָֽיו׃ וּֽלְיִשְׁמָעֵ֘אל\n  שְׁמַעְתִּיךָ֒ הִנֵּ֣ה ׀ בֵּרַ֣כְתִּי אֹת֗וֹ וְהִפְרֵיתִ֥י אֹת֛וֹ\n  וְהִרְבֵּיתִ֥י אֹת֖וֹ בִּמְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֤ר נְשִׂיאִם֙\n  יוֹלִ֔יד וּנְתַתִּ֖יו לְג֥וֹי גָּדֽוֹל׃ <strong>וְאֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י</strong> אָקִ֣ים\n  אֶת־יִצְחָ֑ק אֲשֶׁר֩ תֵּלֵ֨ד לְךָ֤ שָׂרָה֙ לַמּוֹעֵ֣ד הַזֶּ֔ה\n  בַּשָּׁנָ֖ה הָאַחֶֽרֶת׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(My modifications to Sefaria translation:)</p>\n\n<p>And God said: ‘‘But Sarah, your wife shall bear you a son; and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish (obj. marker) <strong>My covenant</strong> with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he give birth to, and I will make him a great nation. But (obj. marker) <strong>My covenant</strong> will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto you at this set time in the next year.’</p>\n\n<p>I have bolded the term אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֥י as well as marked in the English, where the word אֶת would be (as there is no direct English word translation for it.)</p>\n\n<p>The 1st verse, verse 19 mentions the covenant that G-d is making with Isaac. I think you agree, that in verse 19, it does not mean \"with\". Then, verse 20, interrupts the \"thought\" as G-d talks about Yisma'el. Finally, in verse 21, he goes back to talk about the <strong>same</strong> covenant that was mentioned back in verse 19. The same terminology is used.</p>\n\n<p>If it meant the word \"with\", the Torah would use the term  ועם .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Malbim (commentary to Numbers 22:21) writes that את is used as \"with\" when two entities are engaged in the same activity but are not equals in that activity. Thus Bilaam was told not to go with - עם - the messengers of Balak (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbers 22:12</a>), but was told he could go with - את - the messengers of Balak (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbers 22:20</a>), and was then scolded for going with - עם - the messengers of Balak (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbers 22:21</a>), because he was meant to go along with them, but not with the intent to harm the Jewish people as was their intent.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, \"את\" as a conjunction is used between two objects involved in the same activity, not as one acting through another (i.e. \"he went to the store with me\" and not \"I built my shed with this hammer\"). This usage of \"את\" meaning \"with\" wouldn't work in this verse, and therefore it must default to it's usage as direct-object marker.</p>\n\n\n",

Or when they arrive? (They have heard of Kosher and think their salad is Kosher, but assume the salad for whatever reason isn't kosher.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've had similar situations with a guest bringing me a food present that \"seemed\" kosher. I've usually handled it by being honest without going into too much detail. </p>\n\n<p>Explain to them what your kosher requirements are. You also need to be clear and a bit emphatic that while something may be considered \"kosher\", there are numerous interpretations and variances to each person's custom and definition of kosher. Cite one or two specific examples esp. if it applies to their salad, as to why you cannot eat it. E.g. - do you require that you personally inspect all veggies under a light even if the veggies have been \"bodek\" - checked before packaging? (I'm not stating that this is necessary, but if that's what you do, and they don't, you tell your friends that.)</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, state this before they come, as this will avoid toil and embarrassment. It also lets you suggest a specific packaged item that they CAN buy, if they insist on giving you a gift. After they have brought the food, it's a bit difficult. I know that as your question states, you've told them not to bring anything, but they seem well-meaning, as they didn't understand the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Most good friends will understand and respect your dietary requirements, and may even be fascinated by it. If they get offended, seriously, think over the friendship, itself. It indicates that they are intolerant and possibly, imposing.</p>\n\n<p>When I invite guests, I ask them, before they come, if they have any restrictions - dietary or otherwise. I go out of my way to accommodate the \"stricter\" level where possible. It's called being a good, gracious host. Likewise, if your friends get offended, and you want to attempt to reason with them, you can mention what you do to be a gracious host, and it's only sensible for them to be \"gracious\" guests. It sounds like a \"harsh\" tactic, and I would use it only when absolutely needed. Sometimes people need a bit of a \"polite shock\" to wake them up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitzur Shulchan Oruch 1 (3)</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'Judah, the son of Tema, said:  'Be bold as a leopard, light as an\n  eagle, swift as a deer, and strong as a lion, to do the will of thy\n  Father who is in heaven' '.

There are special methods of removing these insects and generally we do not eat salads that have not been prepared according to these guidelines.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A simple forthright explanation is best. Being gentle in tone, you can explain that even if the vegetables are kosher, the knives and other utensils used to chop the vegetables and prepare the salad may have been used on other non-kosher items. And any non-kosher residue those utensils might have would make the salad non-kosher.</p>\n\n<p>If they say, they will buy a brand new knife and cutting board in order to prepare the salad for you, you can tell them the knife has to be toveled in a mikvah before used to chop the salad. That will either be a huge inconvenience for them, and a deterrent that will lead them to drop the matter entirely. Or it will stimulate them to ask questions, and possibly go to a mikvah to tovel the knife. That is one heck of a kiruv opportunity. So either way this leads to a win win.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, it is better for you to learn seforim that inspire you to live as a better Jew.</p>\n\n<p>One popular way is to follow your father's way in life and ask him for a path consistent with your family's Torah growth. Another way (and in addition) is to join a Yeshivah and follow their path.

I'm patur! – Double AA♦ Feb 15 '13 at 20:13\"</p>\n\n<p>I assume that this refers to the notion that one who is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osek_b%27mitzvah_patur_min_hamitzvah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">busy</a> with a mitzvah is exempted from the obligation to fulfill other mitzvot (which, I know, has many subtleties).</p>\n\n<p>I am currently under a doctor's care and have some pills to take (full disclosure -- I just took one) and the side effects <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/sfx/codeine-side-effects.html#refs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">include</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most frequently observed adverse reactions include drowsiness lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and constipation</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>most of which would make me feel incapable of speaking in front of a distinguished person, as per the citation in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/26322/1362\">this</a> answer (and, as it is not Purim, I cannot use the exception which that citation allows).</p>\n\n<p>But I take it because I am told to by my doctor, and guarding my well being is an obligation on its own, as written <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2011/02/shut-sms-101.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q: Is it a Mitzvah to take medicine which a doctor prescribed me?\n  A: Yes. The Torah commands \"And he shall surely heal him.\" It is a Mitzvah to be healed by a doctor (Baba Kama 85a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not asking for a psak, but just for insight into the potential for a contradiction. I understand that all these side effects don't always happen and if one is not remotely incapacitated, there is less concern regarding prayer but I wonder -- do these two notions come into conflict? Is one who consistently feels a side effect then possibly patur from the obligation to daven for the duration of a medical treatment?</p>\n\n<p>If my assumptions are incorrect, please correct me. TIA.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Being \"patur\" (released) from the obligation to pray when drunk is not because you are involved in a mitzvah. It is because you are incapable of praying with intention (kavanah). And it is about the degree of incapacitation (intoxication). Stop drinking alcohol. Wait 18 minutes and you can pray.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of your medication, you have an obligation to safeguard your health, both physical and mental. That means you are not allowed to do something that will injure yourself and you are required to maintain good health. There are both positive and negative commandments involved.</p>\n\n<p>If your doctor has prescribed a particular medication for you and says that you need to take it to safeguard yourself from harm. You have an obligation to follow his advice in order to maintain your health.</p>\n\n<p>How much this effects your ability to concentrate for prayer and for how long is only something you can judge. But you should try to keep in mind that the requirement for having intention during prayer is only required in those brief sections that are indicated in halacha, like the first line of Shema and the opening blessing of the Amidah. Everything else is simply recital if you cannot concentrate. And in the case of the Amidah, listening to the Shaliach Tzibbur makes it even easier.</p>\n\n<p>Each of us has unique challenges in our personal service to HaShem. At this time in your life, it may revolve around this subject of kavanah. But a good way to view it is that you are being asked to make more personal effort to focus for the brief moments when intention is required. An excellent discussion of this subject can be found in chapter 38 of the Tanya.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7917/jewish/Chapter-38.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7917/jewish/Chapter-38.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

If I sue my friend Jim and I make $10 million, isn't it wrong of me to build a $10mil mansion and call the house \"Jim\"? I would never make any mention of it because I took something from <strong>Jim</strong>.  Isn't this rubbing it in? Should she not have instead been quiet to herself and counted her blessings internally? And perhaps even felt bad that she took a child from Rachel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Your analogy is incorrect as it does not apply to what happened to Leah. Leah did not attempt to \"take away\" a son from Rachel and it was thanks to Hashem who had done this. Rav Hirsch points out that with each of the three previous sons she recognized an increasing connection to her husband. In fact, Rav Hirsch says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is accordingly, highly significant that at Levi, it is not she, but\n  he who expresses this in giving the baby its name. ... so that, when\n  the fourth son was born, Yehudah, she no longer had to welcome it as a\n  means of progress in her husband's love towards her, which she now\n  fully possessed, but could simply enjoy her baby purely for its own\n  sake. She accordingly pronounced the words of a happy mother \"This\n  time I can thank Hashem, just for His gift itself\" and called the\n  child Yehudah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus we see it was not taken away from Rachel, but an acknowledgement of the goodness of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, she could have considered him the fourth child of the six that she had been alloted. That is, the maidservants had not yet been given to Yaakov as wives and might not be part of the count. According to Rashi, who counts all four, Rachel could also have had four and each of the maidservants two. Thus, the acknowledgement did not \"take away\" from Rachel.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, When her final child was born (Dinah), Leah prayed that it be a girl and that Rachel have a boy (Yosef). The medrash says that originally, Dinah was supposed to be another boy and Leah's prayer changed the event so that she had a girl and Rachel could have two boys.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @DanF for pointing out that Rachel did not feel as the analogy might have it either.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Within the \"mix\" keep in mind that when the Torah says that she was\n  \"jealous\" of Leah, it was a \"positive\" jealousy (see Rash\"i on that\n  verse). She was jealous that G-d answered Leah's prayers, and realized\n  that she had to try harder. She wasn't hurt that Leah had all those\n  children. If anything, we see how Rachel always tried to appease her\n  older sister, even in a situation where, perhaps, Leah was acting\n  \"mean\". In short, to say or imply that Le'ah was rubbing it in seems\n  incorrect. – DanF</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps an answer can be brought courtesy of the Ksav Sofer.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 7:</a> states that Leah was the first person in the world to give thanks. On the surface this is hard to understand, especially since there were a number of righteous people that had lived virtuous lives (Avraham, Sarah, Yitzchak, Rivka and Yaakov)?! Yet, the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14083&st=&pgnum=148&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ksav Sofer</a> points out that whilst they too thanked Hashem, their thanks was for open miracles. Leah was the first person to show gratitude over a ‘natural’ experience – i.e. the act of having four children. Therefore, Leah introduced us to the fact that one must give thanks even for the everyday things that go on around us.</p>\n<p>As such, she wasn't 'rubbing it in', it was rather a declaration of genuine thanks to Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam (Mamrim 6:3 as\nunderstood by the Griz Talmud Torah 5:11) says that one standing as\nfar as one can see one’s rav muvhak because there’s an additional\nobligation of honoring him just like one honor’s parent, which is\ndifferent than the regular obligation to stand for a talmid chacham.</p>\n<p>8 Shulchan Aruch YD 242:30</p>\n<p>9 S”A YD 244:10</p>\n<p>16  Shach 244:11 seems to say that the minhag is to stand only for an\nAv Bet Din or Rosh Yeshiva, but he leaves it as a tzarich iyun.

This was true two millennia ago and remains true today.

Seeing as the other wives don't start giving birth till Yehuda is born and the first 4 children all come from Leah, how do they manage to have the other 8 kids in 3/4 years?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>And to add greater force to the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now it is not difficult to understand how Jacob could have had twelve\n  children in seven years from four different women. No doubt a number\n  of the children could have been born contemporaneously. However, it is\n  amazing to read that Leah gave birth to seven of the twelve children\n  which were born at that time. Of course, there is nothing biologically\n  impossible about having seven children in seven years, but the real\n  problem arises when we learn that during that seven year period,\n      \"Leah saw that she left off bearing, so she took Zilpah her handmaid,\n      and gave her to Jacob to wife. And Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bare Jacob\n      a son. And Leah said, 'Fortunate!' and she called his name Gad. And\n      Zilpah Leah's handmaid bear Jacob a second son. And Leah said, 'Happy\n      am I!' For the daughters will call me happy! and she called his name\n      Asher\" (Gen. 30:9-13). <strong>How could Leah have borne seven children and\n      have had a barren period in which her handmaid bore two children, all\n      in seven years?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This quote is from: <a href=\"https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/01-genesis/text/articles-books/zimmerman-jacobchronology-gtj.pdf\">https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/01-genesis/text/articles-books/zimmerman-jacobchronology-gtj.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The Rashbam to Bereishis 43:33 writes that not only were the 6 sons of Leah born in 7 years, but also all of the other sons of Yaakov (with the obvious exception of Binyamin, who is explicitly mentioned as having been born later).</p>\n\n<p>There are two basic possibilities of how this would happen. One option is that the literal chronology of the verses (which implies that each pregnancy only began after the previous pregnancy ended, and not that pregnancies overlapped where applicable) is not meant to be taken literally, and when Yehuda was born, Bilhah was already well into her pregnancy with Dan etc., which frees up (let's say) 2 and a half years or so which are accounted for by overlapping pregnancies.</p>\n\n<p>The other option is that each pregnancy began very shortly after the previous one ended, and that most if not all of the sons of Yaakov were born at 7 months. This would not be incredibly strange, as we have a fairly large cast of significant Biblical characters who were born at 7 months, or into the 7th month (including Yitzchok (Rosh Hashana 11a), Peretz and Zerach (Rashi to Bereishis 38:27), Moshe Rabbeinu (Rashi Shemos 2:3) and Shmuel (Niddah 38b), among others). This would yield 12 pregnancies at 7 months each = 84 months of pregnancy over the course of 7 years = 84 months.</p>\n\n<p>רבינו בחיי in Parshas Vayishlach (Bereishis 35:30) writes that Reuven, Shimon, and Levi were all born at 7 months. מחזור ויטרי to Avos 5:21 writes the same. The reason they only identify these three is that by them it is implicit in Chazal, as they say (Bereishis Rabba 80:10) that Levi was 13 when he and Shimon attacked Shechem, and if you do the math (I'll leave it to the reader) this means he had to be born within <em>less than</em> 2 years of Yaakov's marriage to Leah. Once we know the first three had this \"incredible coincidence\" of all being born at 7 months, I see no reason to assume that a) there wasn't some <em>hashgacha</em>-related significance to that which would carry through to the rest of the children of Yaakov, and b) that there wasn't some biological condition that Leah had, and by association her sister(s) (as there is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15715591\" rel=\"noreferrer\">evidence</a> that preterm labor has genetic factors), which made them prone to preterm labor.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Ralbag, due to other problems in working out the chronology of the birth of Yehuda's children, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19168&st=&pgnum=73\" rel=\"noreferrer\">understands this story very differently</a> (bottom of second column in link). He says that really Yaakov married Leah and Rachel at the <em>beginning</em> of the first 7 years, not at the end. He concludes that this resolves another issue of how 12 children were born in 7 years, as according to his explanation it was 14 years. He concedes, however, that the verses in their simple reading imply both of my above assumptions, that it took place in 7 years and they were all consecutive without overlap. He also notes that the view of Chazal is not in accordance with his own view. [I would also note that this is exactly the kind of thing that the Maharal raged against the Ralbag for - extricating the verses from both their simple meaning and the way Chazal understood them to satisfy his own notions.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the Bible not a work of theology?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Bible contains stories, and poetry, and history, and myth, and rules, and a few other bits and pieces. What it does not contain is <em>theology</em>, per se. Nowhere in the Bible does anyone attempt to describe a cosmology: they assume their audience is in on it. Nowhere in the Bible is there a straightforward description of God, or the spiritual world, or any other simply laid out description of the structure of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Now, those stories, poetry, myth, etc. reflect, of course, the beliefs of those who wrote them, so you can, if you peer at it carefully enough, <em>derive</em> theology from it by attempting to infer the beliefs of the writers. And that is what theologians do. However, there is no part of the Bible which reads like a theology text. The theology has to be inferred from the narrative, the legislation, the prophecy, and the poetry.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I think you are confusing <strong>theology</strong> with one of its sub components: doctrine/dogma. A systematised description of theology is only one approach to theology. In fact your comment (below the question) that the Christian New Testament does contain theology in the letters shows that your understanding of theology isn't broad enough: for Christians the Gospels are fundamental for Christian theology, equally important as the letters, because theology is about <strong>knowing God</strong>. Theology is so much more than just knowing <em>about</em> God in an informational sense.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Exod-6\">Exodus 6:6-7</a>: Say, therefore, to the Israelite people: I am the Lord. I will free you from the labors of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and through extraordinary chastisements. And I will take you to be My people, and I will be your God. And you shall know that I, the Lord, am your God who freed you from the labors of the Egyptians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Deut-7\">Deuteronomy 7:9-10</a>: Know, therefore, that only the Lord your God is God, the steadfast God who keeps His covenant faithfully to the thousandth generation of those who love Him and keep His commandments, but who instantly requites with destruction those who reject Him—never slow with those who reject Him, but requiting them instantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Prov-2\">Proverbs 2:1-5</a><br>\n  My son, if you accept my words<br>\n  And treasure up my commandments;<br>\n  If you make your ear attentive to wisdom<br>\n  And your mind open to discernment;<br>\n  If you call to understanding<br>\n  And cry aloud to discernment,<br>\n  If you seek it as you do silver<br>\n  And search for it as for treasures,<br>\n  Then you will understand the fear of the Lord<br>\n  And attain knowledge of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Tanakh we meet a God who created the world and decreed it \"very good\".</p>\n\n<p>We meet a God who wanted our trust even though he knew that we would struggle to trust him, so he gave Abraham not just a promise that he would do good to him, but a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a sign, when his simple word should've been enough.</p>\n\n<p>We meet a God who deemed to take away the Ostrich's wisdom so that it would crush its own eggs (Job 39:11-18).</p>\n\n<p>We meet a God who was grieved when Israel whored itself to other gods (Ezekiel 16).</p>\n\n<p>We meet a God who loved David and called him a man after his own heart, even though David committed adultery and then schemed to have the woman's husband killed.</p>\n\n<p>And we meet a God who willingly inspired both the beauty of the Psalms and the crudity of Ezekiel 23:20, and calls them both his word.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible is a work of theology, but it takes effort to read and understand, because the goal of the Bible is not to list some facts, but to introduce us to God himself!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Our tradition believes in an Oral Torah which accompanies the Written Torah. Our Oral tradition describes that there are two parts of Jewish wisdom, described as <em>Ma'aseh Bereishis</em> and <em>Ma'aseh Merkava</em> - the account of creation and the account of G-d's divine chariot - which are not meant to be publicly expounded.</p>\n<p>The Mishna in Chagiga 2:1 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין דורשין ....ולא במעשה בראשית בשנים ולא במרכבה ביחיד, אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתו</p>\n<p>One may not expound upon ... the account of creation to two people, nor the account of the chariot to [even] one, unless he is wise and puts it together on his own (translation mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are many interpretations of the exact nature of these bodies of knowledge, but let's stick to Maimonides. He comments to this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהם מכינים במעשה בראשית למדעי הטבע והמחקר בראשית הבריאה. וכוונתם במעשה מרכבה המדע האלקי והוא הדבור על כללות המציאות ועל מציאות הבורא ודעתו ותאריו וחיוב הנמצאים ממנו והמלאכים</p>\n<p>[The sages] use the term \"account of creation\" for the knowledge of nature and investigation into the beginning of creation. And their intention with the term \"account of the chariot\" is knowledge of the divine, which is the discussion of the general nature of existence, existence of the Creator, His knowledge and descriptions, angels, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this basically accounts for structure of the universe, G-d, and the spiritual world. We do have knowledge of it, it just was not included in the written portion of the Torah in order to keep it secret.</p>\n<p>As to why it would be kept secret, Maimonides goes on to say that this information is knowledge that everyone would want, whether they are intelligent enough to understand and process it or not, and many would integrate the knowledge without the proper prerequisite knowledge and background to appropriately understand it, and would come to gross misunderstandings, which would either lead to inappropriate beliefs and conclusions, or, in their not appreciating the wisdom, would lead to their rejection of this knowledge as being silly, and with it their rejection of the source of this knowledge. Therefore it is to be taught discerningly to those who can appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>the torah needs to speak to all human beings regardless of their intellectual level or young age.\nhere is an excerpt from part 10 of Duties of the Heart, a classical work on Jewish philosophy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if the scriptures had employed more accurate, truer terminology, then\n  nobody would have understood it except the wise, understanding reader\n  and most of mankind would have been left without religion and without\n  Torah (guidance) due to their limited intellect and weak understanding\n  in spiritual matters. But the word which may be understood in a\n  material sense will not damage the understanding person because he\n  recognizes its real meaning, and it is at the same time beneficial to\n  the simple person so that it will fix in his heart and mind that there\n  is a Creator which it is his duty to serve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He does not believe in His holy ones,” [i.e., God does not consider even His holy ones as righteous until after their deaths, when they are no longer subject to the evil inclination,] nevertheless, here He associated His name with Isaac because his eyes had become dim, and he was confined in the house, and he was like a dead person, the evil inclination having ceased from him (Tanchuma Toledoth 7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to explain that being blind and housebound either causes the evil inclination to be removed, or that those 2 qualities, along with the removal of the evil inclination creates a status of \"like a dead person.\"</p>\n\n<p>Is there any halachic implication to that? Would someone visiting Isaac be tamei met? Would someone today who is blind and housebound (especially a tzaddik) be considered \"dead\" for any practical purposes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the explanation of Rav Hirsch it appears that Avraham is called Avicha and not Yitzchak because the inheritance (and the bracha) was passed along to Yaakov. It was now his turn \"to build a complete Jewish household\" and to create the \"Abrahamitic future\". Thus, since Yitzchak was housebound and blind, he could not take an active part in the community that he lived in and was thus \"dead\" as far as those he had been influencing were concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the way that Rav Hirsch explains the situation, it is referring to the hashkafa and the ruchnius aspect of the situation. Since Yitzchak was still <strong>physically</strong> alive, then it would not cause actual tum'a.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly Rash\"i uses the term <strong>כמת</strong> rather than מת which again implies a spiritual similarity rather than actually being considered \"dead\". Also note that Yitzchak at this time would be about 137. That is Yaakov has spent the last fourteen years at the Yeshivah of Eiver after having left home at 63 (when Yitzchak was 123) so that Yitzchak has another 43 years to live.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that Yitzchak is not considered \"dead\" for a practical purpose, but just for the purpose of the bracha of Hashem and being in the status of the next link in the chain of succession.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In terms of your two possibilities</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>being blind and housebound either causes the evil inclination to be removed, or that those 2 qualities, along with the removal of the evil inclination creates a status of \"like a dead person\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the text of Rashi implies the first. First of all, Rashi does not say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שיצר הרע פסק ממנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which would mean the Chabad translation, \"the evil inclination having ceased from him,\" but rather</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויצר הרע פסק ממנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which translates to <strong>and</strong> the evil inclination had ceased from him. Thus the point about the cessation of the evil inclination is not stated as an antecedent to his being like a dead person, but as an additional detail.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the wording of Rashi is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפי שכהו עיניו וכלוא היה בבית, <strong>והרי</strong> הוא כמת</p>\n<p>because his eyes had become dim and he was confined to the house, <strong>and behold</strong> he was like a dead person</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the word הרי conveying a consequence. Thus, the status of being like he was dead was a consequence of the two points that he was blind and confined to the house.</p>\n<p>That being said:</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22745&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zayis Ra'anan commentary to Yalkut</a> cites a medrash which says that Yaakov Avinu had the status of a Kohen, and based thereon asks how Rachel could have taken the <em>terafim</em>, which were made out of a corpse, into the tent of Yaakov. So apparently Yaakov was enough of a Kohen to not be allowed to become impure.</p>\n<p>Yaakov went into Yitzchok's tent when Yitzchok was blind, and even touched him, so it seems there is no issue of <em>tumas mes</em> by a blind person.</p>\n\n\n",

But my question on this would then be, why do we make such a big deal of giving certain aveirot certain punishments?</p>\n\n<p>2) The Rambam learns Arba Misos differently than the Ramban and says that they are four separate Mitzvos (see <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/e0001.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">226-229</a>). According to the Rambam, I understand why each aveira needs a certain punishment, but then how would the Rambam read the Tosefta?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I emailed a Rebbe of mine from YU.

What follows are notes from one of his Talmidim: </p>\n\n<p><strong>רבינו יוסף</strong> writes that the חידוש of רוצח is that if you can’t give him סייף you can do whatever you need, and the same is true for גואל הדם, but within the ד' מיתות בית דין you can do whatever you want בדיעבד.\nBut how does רבינו יוסף explain מותרה לדבר חמור?</p>\n\n<p><strong>תוס'</strong> explains that the only time there is a דין of כל מיתה is when the person is חייב מיתת ב\"ד and he runs away, then you can give him whatever you want to kill him, but in a normal case, if you mixed up נסקלין and נשרפין then you cannot give him whatever מיתה you want.</p>\n\n<p>רבינו יוסף obviously would not accept תוס'’s first answer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ר' שמואל רוזובסקי</strong> explains that this must be a גזירת הכתוב, but in general the מצות מיתת ב\"ד is whatever they deserve. There is noגזירת הכתוב for כל מיתה, it’s פשוט, רבינו יוסף clearly understands that there is one מצוה called מיתת ב\"ד, and the תורה gives you details about what they should get לכתחילה.</p>\n\n<p>בורח שאני only makes sense according to תוס' as a גזירת הכתוב, but not according to רבינו יוסף.\nרבינו יוסף did not think this was a קשיא in the first place, for he is חייב מיתה, any of the ד' מיתות is a קיום of his חיוב, and therefore you need התראה and now it’s מותרה לדבר חמור.</p>\n\n<p>But the whole סוגיא of מותרה לדבר חמור sounds like all the ארבע מיתות are separate?\nIf you wanted to say that this was the מחלוקת ר' שישא and ר' אשי, it would be difficult because the same should then apply to מלקות!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>So it's clear in the Sefer Hamitzvos you mention that each Misa is a separate Mitzvah.

From where do we derive this? It is derived from this incident involving Ahithophel. When David dug the drainpipes in preparation for building the Temple, the waters of the depths rose and sought to inundate the world. David said: What is the halakha? Is it permitted to write the sacred name on an earthenware shard and throw it into the depths, so that the water will subside and stand in its place? There was no one who said anything to him. David said: Anyone who knows the answer to this matter and does not say it shall be strangled. <br><br>Then Ahithophel raised an a fortiori inference on his own and said: And if in order to make peace between a man and his wife in the case of a sota, when the husband suspects his wife of having committed adultery, the Torah says: My name that was written in sanctity shall be erased on the water, then, in order to establish peace for the whole world in its entirety, is it not all the more so permitted? Ahithophel said to David: It is permitted. David wrote the sacred name on an earthenware shard and cast it into the depths, and the water in the depths subsided and stood in its place.<br><br>And even so it is written that during the rebellion of Absalom: “And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not taken, and he saddled his donkey and he arose and went to his house, to his town, and he commanded his household and strangled himself” (II Samuel 17:23). Although David stipulated that his curse would take effect only if one who knows the answer fails to share it with him, and Ahithophel did not fail to share it with him, the curse was realized. <br><br>The Gemara cites a similar statement: Rabbi Abbahu says: With regard to the curse of a Sage, even if it is stated conditionally, it comes to realization. From where do we derive this? It is derived from an incident involving Eli the High Priest, as Eli said to Samuel, after the latter had received a prophetic vision with regard to Eli, that his sons do not follow his path: “Therefore may God do to you, and more also, if you hide any matter from me of all the matters that He spoke unto you” (I Samuel 3:17). And even though it is written immediately thereafter: “And Samuel told him all the matters, and did not hide from him” (I Samuel 3:18), it is written at the time of Samuel’s death: “And his sons did not follow in his ways” (I Samuel 8:3), indicating that God did to Samuel as he prophesied with regard to Eli, and his own sons did not follow his path. Despite the fact that Eli stated the curse conditionally, Samuel was affected by the curse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Since this new species comes from kosher and non-kosher species, there would be several potential halachic arguments that might be raised. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Bittul</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Would we consider it a <em>taaroveth</em> (mixture) of kosher and non-kosher? If that were the case, we would presumably be able to apply the rule of <em>bittul b'rov/b'shishim/b'elef</em> (annulment in a majority/1:60/1:1,000) inasmuch as the majority of the tissue come from kosher sources. </p>\n\n<p>However, it's at best controversial whether a living organism could be considered a full-fledged <em>ta'aroveth</em>. While we are indeed strict with regard to animals that have been entirely sustained/fed with non-kosher (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.60.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">Rama Yoreh De'ah 60:1</a>), animals that even have been primarily fed non-kosher would not seem to be a problem. If genetic engineering is considered no more significant than feeding, it shouldn't be a problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Davar hama'amid</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>One potential caveat to this reasoning is presented by the principle of <em>davar hamaamid</em> (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.9.16?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">Rambam Ma'achaloth Assuroth 9:16</a>), since the non-kosher tissue/gene causes the animal's dramatic growth-rate. A counterpoint to this line of argument would be that the actual non-kosher tissue that is added is presumably smaller than what could be discerned by the naked eye which may well remove from it any halachic significance (though this reasoning itself potentially opens up a Pandora's box of questioning...). Further, an animal fed primarily but not exclusively non-kosher is also arguably no worse in this respect.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/opinion/sunday/can-seafood-be-kosher-and-sustainable.html\">a recent New York Times article on the topic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All that being said, when we return to the question of the genetically engineered salmon, Rabbi Menachem Genack, the chief executive of the Orthodox Union’s Kosher Division, believes that the genetically engineered salmon would probably be kosher even if some of its genetic material came from trayf. “If this is a salmon that has fins and easily removable scales,” Rabbi Genack told me, “that is what’s critical.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I'd asked Rabbi Hershel Welcher of Queens a similar question, about <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/bullet-proof-skin-spider-silk_n_930389.html\">goats that were given a bit of spider genes</a> so they would produce gossamer in their milk. He felt the concept of \"zeh v'zeh gorem, mutar\" applied -- as the spider genes would not have sufficed to produce an organism, such a goat is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>So the same should apply here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (Toras Moshe parshas Shemini) writes that the meaning of the Medrash (cited by many Rishonim) that the pig is called a חזיר because עתיד הקב\"ה להחזירה לישראל - Hashem is going to \"return\" it to the Jewish people - is that the physiology of the pig will be altered to chew its cud (the Kosher sign that it currently does not have) and will therefore be Kosher. The Chofetz Chaim said, based thereon, that the Kosher signs are actually the <em>cause</em> of an animal being Kosher or non-Kosher - the same pig, upon being given the second Kosher sign, will become Kosher.</p>\n\n<p>That being the case, if this fish has fins and scales, then it is Kosher.</p>\n\n<p>I was present when R' Heinemann was asked on point about AquAdvantage salmon, and he said that it is Kosher for this reason. (He specifically based it on the verse about fish - כל אשר לו סנפיר וקשקשת במים בימים ובנחלים אותם תאכלו - anything which has fins and scales in the water, seas, and streams you may eat. If it has fins and scales, bon appetite.)</p>\n\n\n",

There are many tithes separated from produce in Israel and the rabbinate, in certifying that given produce is kosher (if requested to do so by the grower), only removes those tithes which cannot be eaten nowadays, namely, Terumah Gedolah and Terumat Maaser (totaling about 1% of the crop), plus in years 1,2,4,5 of the Shemitta cycle, there is 10% of the crop (called Maaser Sheni) whose value is redeemed onto a small coin before becoming edible.</p>\n\n<p>There remains 10% of the crop (called Maaser Rishon) <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/44425/759\">which should ideally be given to a Levi</a>, and, in years 3 and 6 of the Shemitta cycle, there is 10% of the crop (called Maaser Ani) which must be given to the poor. The rabbinate does not enforce this and many growers regularly, unfortunately, steal this from the poor. There is no holiness attached to that produce, so the food in the market is still Kosher to eat.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question: yes there are tithes that need to be given to the poor, but the rabbinate generally does not impose this and it usually ends up getting stolen back by the grower :(</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You are talking about terumah or trumas ma'aser which cannot be eaten nowadays because it must be kept in a state of tahara (ritual purity).

When I say there aren't any reliable historical references, I mean that there aren't any references from works close to being in the same time period. We have plenty of later commentaries that anachronistically insert High Court systems into the Bible, but we can't confirm the authenticity of such statements as they occur so many centuries after the actual events. Also, any systems of judgment mentioned in the Bible are vague often change as the Bible goes on. For example, the Priests are said to be given the authority to provide judgments and to teach the Torah to the people </p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 17</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ח  כִּי יִפָּלֵא מִמְּךָ דָבָר לַמִּשְׁפָּט, בֵּין-דָּם לְדָם\n  בֵּין-דִּין לְדִין וּבֵין נֶגַע לָנֶגַע--דִּבְרֵי רִיבֹת,\n  בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ:  וְקַמְתָּ וְעָלִיתָ--אֶל-הַמָּקוֹם, אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר\n  יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ בּוֹ.    8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in\n  judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between\n  stroke and stroke, even matters of controversy within thy gates; then\n  shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which the LORD thy\n  God shall choose. ט  וּבָאתָ, אֶל-הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם,\n  וְאֶל-הַשֹּׁפֵט, אֲשֶׁר יִהְיֶה בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם; וְדָרַשְׁתָּ\n  וְהִגִּידוּ לְךָ, אֵת דְּבַר הַמִּשְׁפָּט.    9 <strong>And thou shall come unto\n  the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those\n  days; and thou shalt inquire; and they shall declare unto thee the\n  sentence of judgment.</strong> י  וְעָשִׂיתָ, עַל-פִּי הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר\n  יַגִּידוּ לְךָ, מִן-הַמָּקוֹם הַהוּא, אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהוָה;\n  וְשָׁמַרְתָּ לַעֲשׂוֹת, כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ.   10 And thou shalt do\n  according to the tenor of the sentence, which they shall declare unto\n  thee from that place which the LORD shall choose; and thou shalt\n  observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee. יא \n  עַל-פִּי הַתּוֹרָה אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ, וְעַל-הַמִּשְׁפָּט אֲשֶׁר-יֹאמְרוּ\n  לְךָ--תַּעֲשֶׂה:  לֹא תָסוּר, מִן-הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר-יַגִּידוּ\n  לְךָ--יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל.   11 According to the law which they shall teach\n  thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou\n  shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall\n  declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left. יב  וְהָאִישׁ\n  אֲשֶׁר-יַעֲשֶׂה בְזָדוֹן, לְבִלְתִּי שְׁמֹעַ אֶל-הַכֹּהֵן הָעֹמֵד\n  לְשָׁרֶת שָׁם אֶת-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, אוֹ, אֶל-הַשֹּׁפֵט--וּמֵת הָאִישׁ\n  הַהוּא, וּבִעַרְתָּ הָרָע מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל.  12 And the man that doeth\n  presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to\n  minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that\n  man shall die; and thou shalt exterminate the evil from Israel. יג \n  וְכָל-הָעָם, יִשְׁמְעוּ וְיִרָאוּ; וְלֹא יְזִידוּן, עוֹד.  {ס}    13 And\n  all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.\n  {S}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy seems to say that the courts would be held by Levites and Priests, followed then by judges and the like. Compare that to other places in the Torah which speak only of judges, then compare that to the book of Judges where most of them aren't priests, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%203%3A16-28&version=NASB\" rel=\"noreferrer\">compare that to Solomon giving judgments on his own, even though he's not a priest, a levite, nor a judge.</a> And so you are left with several vague systems that often change throughout time as the Bible progresses. So looking for any High Court references in the Bible will not turn up anything reliable. Especially since the High Court or Sanhedrin idea comes late in the Second Temple period. And part of answering your question is tracing the history of the word Sanhedrin, because it's likely that the high court system developed alongside the word Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>The word Sanhedrin itself is actually a Greek word, though most Jews aren't aware of this. The \"Hebrew\" word Sanhedrin (סַנְהֶדְרִין) comes from the Greek: Συνέδριον,<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%203%3A16-28&version=NASB\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a> synedrion, \"sitting together,\" hence \"assembly\" or \"council.\" Since the word is taken so directly from the Greek, some scholars say it shows that the Sanhedrin came to be during the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty (think time of the Maccabees). </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin</a></p>\n\n<p>The closest Biblical references to something like a Sanhedrin are those in the books of Maccabees. Many scholars believe the books of Maccabees were part of the Hebrew Bible since we see them as part of the canon of the Septuagint. Which is why the Catholic church still has the books of the Maccabees, as they canonized the Septuagint. Although at a later point the books of Maccabees were taken out of Biblical canon amongst Jews, we still rely on the historical information present in them. And although the word Sanhedrin/High Court isn't used in Maccabees, a word that describes something similar is used.</p>\n\n<p>2 Maccabees 11:27-33New American Bible (Revised Edition) (NABRE)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>27 The king’s letter to the people was as follows: “King Antiochus\n  sends greetings to <strong>the Jewish senate and to the rest of the Jews.</strong> 28\n  If you are well, it is what we desire. We too are in good health. 29\n  Menelaus has told us of your wish to return home and attend to your\n  own affairs. 30 Therefore, those who return by the thirtieth of\n  Xanthicus will have our assurance of full permission 31 to observe\n  their dietary and other laws, just as before, and none of the Jews\n  shall be molested in any way for faults committed through ignorance.\n  32 I have also sent Menelaus to reassure you. 33 Farewell.” In the one\n  hundred and forty-eighth year, the fifteenth of Xanthicus.[a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Maccabees+11%3A27-33&version=NABRE\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Maccabees+11%3A27-33&version=NABRE</a></p>\n\n<p>The word used there in Maccabees is Gerousia – \"senate\" or \"council.\"  This is the oldest term which was used toward the end of the Persian period (cf. Josephus' Antiquities 12.3.3 and II Maccabees 11:27).  It is used in the New Testament in the book of Luke in Acts 5:21 along with \"Sanhedrin.\"  The author of Luke may have used the word Gerousia juxtaposed to Sanhedrin as a way of explaining the term to Greek speaking readers who did not use the term Sanhedrin the same way the Jews were using it. In much the same way my wife has to explain to me that a \"kitchen roll\" isn't a type of bread, but how British people say \"paper towels.\"</p>\n\n<p>So the final answer is: No, there are no Biblical or Historical sources for a High Court in Judea. You are asking for sources that do not exist, about a system which we have no reliable evidence existed. You could try narrowing your question to asking for sources of what types of court systems exist, or open up your sources to allow for Aggadic or other Rabbinic references.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Not necessarily a High Court, but the story of Ahab and Naboth seems to indicate the existence of a judicial system:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּעֲשׂוּ אַנְשֵׁי עִירוֹ הַזְּקֵנִים וְהַחֹרִים אֲשֶׁר הַיּשְׁבִים בְּעִירוֹ כַּאֲשֶׁר שָׁלְחָה אֲלֵיהֶם אִיזָבֶל כַּאֲשֶׁר כָּתוּב בַּסְּפָרִים אֲשֶׁר שָׁלְחָה אֲלֵיהֶם</p>\n<p>קָרְאוּ צוֹם וְהֹשִׁיבוּ אֶת נָבוֹת בְּרֹאשׁ הָעָם</p>\n<p>יָּבֹאוּ שְׁנֵי הָאֲנָשִׁים בְּנֵי בְלִיַּעַל וַיֵּשְׁבוּ נֶגְדּוֹ וַיְעִדֻהוּ אַנְשֵׁי הַבְּלִיַּעַל אֶת נָבוֹת נֶגֶד הָעָם לֵאמֹר בֵּרַךְ נָבוֹת אֱלֹהִים וָמֶלֶךְ וַיֹּצִאֻהוּ מִחוּץ לָעִיר וַיִּסְקְלֻהוּ בָאֲבָנִים וַיָּמֹת:</p>\n<p>And the men of his city did, the elders and the officials that dwelled in his city, as Jezebel sent to them, as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them.</p>\n<p>They proclaimed a fast, and they set Naboth at the head of the people.</p>\n<p>And the two wicked men came and sat opposite him, and the wicked men testified against Naboth in front of the people saying, \"Naboth cursed God and the king.\" And they took him out of the city and stoned him with stones, and he died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Jezebel needed to go to such effort to orchestrate the scene and find \"wicked men\" to falsely testify against Naboth implies that there was some sort of court system in place that was not wholly controlled by the Crown.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>These are not definitive sources, but the question acknowledges other oblique references to groups of elders and judges, lending these citations weight.</p>\n<p>Rehoboam consulted an established group of elders, possibly a Judiciary body, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 12</a>:6, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Chron 10</a>:6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּוָּעַץ הַמֶּלֶךְ רְחַבְעָם, אֶת-הַזְּקֵנִים אֲשֶׁר-הָיוּ עֹמְדִים לִפְנֵי שְׁלֹמֹה אָבִיו, בִּהְיֹתוֹ חַי, לֵאמֹר:  אֵיךְ אַתֶּם נוֹעָצִים, לְהָשִׁיב לָעָם-הַזֶּה דָּבָר.</p>\n<p><sup><em>And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying: 'What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?'</em></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The newly crowned Jeroboam also took council before erecting golden calves at Beth El and Dan,(<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 12</a>:28):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּוָּעַץ הַמֶּלֶךְ--וַיַּעַשׂ, שְׁנֵי עֶגְלֵי זָהָב; וַיֹּאמֶר אֲלֵהֶם, רַב-לָכֶם מֵעֲלוֹת יְרוּשָׁלִַם--הִנֵּה אֱלֹהֶיךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל, אֲשֶׁר הֶעֱלוּךָ מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרָיִם.</p>\n<p><sup><em>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them: 'Ye have gone up long enough to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'</em></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on these verses, it seems that at the very least kings of both states had groups of advisors. Whether these groups had judicial power is unclear, but it would seem that they worked under the king, and had some say in his policy. Perhaps when it came to more mundane judicial matters, they were given authority.</p>\n\n\n",

In the post-Talmudic era, it was realized that it was no longer a given that the righteous would be remembered simply by virtue of their teachings. The increase of national calamities, future exiles, and the spiritual decline of future generations, created a risk that the Jewish people may indeed forget the earlier sages and their teachings. As a result, a more permissive attitude toward erecting elaborate monuments on the graves of the righteous became common. </p>\n\n\n",

The first is that since Yaakov changed the name of her son (Ben Oni to Binyamin) he put up the monument to show that it was not because of any lack in her. He also pointds out that she was buried \"by the side of the road\" and a monument was necessary so that the family (and her descendants) would be able to identify the location and be able to pray there.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Munk also points out that the Jews being sent into exile prayed there for mercy.</p>\n\n<p>Devorah was buried at an easily identifiable spot (as explained by Rabbi Sorotzkin in 35:8).

Here is a summary of those\nhalachos</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chevrakadisha.com/laws-of-mourning/#_Toc253498995\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Before the Burial</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>From the time of death until after the burial, the close relatives, which are the father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother and sister, are considered onenim, which means:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    They should be involved in the burial preparations\n\n    They are to respect the deceased:\n        by not behaving in a light-headed manner\n        by not eating in the presence of the body\n        by not eating meat or drinking wine\n\n    They are exempt from mitzvos:\n        not to pray, or say Amen or put on tefillin\n        not to say berachos \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(even for eating, berachos are not required, but the hands are washed for bread without a beracha)</p>\n\n<p>They may not bathe, take haircuts, or do work, but they may wear shoes until the burial at the cemetery. They may also leave the house to take care of the needs of the deceased.</p>\n\n<p>An autopsy is forbidden because the Torah considers it a defilement to the departed. In case one is requested by authorities to do so, call the local Orthodox funeral home or your LOR. As a practical matter, one should not try to deal with the authorities oneself. They will often treat one as \"upset\" and to be ignored. The local Orthodox funeral home will often have dealt with this problem in the past and know who to call about the matter. They will usually know when the halacha would allow an autopsy or the name of a rabbi who is an expert in these matters.</p>\n\n<p>The deceased may not be left alone. A person is therefore designated to serve as a shomer (watchman) in honor of the deceased. Since the watchman is exempt from mitzvos while on duty, it is helpful to appoint two watchmen so that they may relieve each other. (If there is no alternative, the watchman may leave for brief periods.) They may not study Torah, but they may say Tehillim (Psalms). They may not eat while on guard. (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 195:11)</p>\n\n<p>Beware of funeral homes that are ignorant of the Torah laws and Jewish traditional customs. Check with a competent Orthodox Rabbi or with a reliable friend for a reference to authentic Jewish services and proper pre-burial preparations for the deceased (taharah).</p>\n\n\n",

It was on wheels so that they could roll it into other rooms on occasion (like the library) for extra minyanim when there were overflow crowds.

    "content": "# What is an overview of Judaism's arguments against the \"unconscious violinist\" analogy used to support abortion in the case of rape?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am looking for the response of <strong>any denomination</strong> that is against abortion in the case of rape that has also responded to the scenario below or something similar to it.</p>\n\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_Abortion#The_Violinist\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Defense of Abortion</a>\" (Thomson):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with\n  an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been\n  found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers\n  has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you\n  alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped\n  you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged\n  into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from\n  his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he\n  will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment,\n  and can safely be unplugged from you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is said later that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Critics of Thomson's argument generally grant the permissibility of\n  unplugging the violinist, but seek to block the inference that\n  abortion is permissible by arguing that there are morally relevant\n  differences between the violinist scenario and typical cases of\n  abortion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it is <strong>unsourced</strong>. :(</p>\n\n<p>To make my intentions clear, the above is an analogy for a female being raped and impregnated by a male. <strong>Some denominations claim that the female is obliged to carry the child to birth if medically practical</strong> because the child is innocent of his/her father's sins, has a right to life, etc etc etc.</p>\n\n<p>(Assume ideal conditions such as medical complications not being present so the mother and child are healthy, the mother can give birth, the mother and the father are not close relatives, a proper hospital is available and can be afforded, an adoption agency is available etc etc etc)</p>\n\n<p><strong>So do those arguments apply to the violinist too?</strong> What are the \"morally relevant differences\" ? I understand that Thomson was defending abortion in non-rape cases, but let us consider only rape cases.</p>\n\n<p>What's the difference? Why are women responsible for carrying a child, who she did not consent to carrying, to birth but people are not responsible for caring for a violinist who they were attached to without consent?</p>\n\n<p>I am not saying women are not responsible, but <strong>if they are, it looks like everyone is responsible for the violinist.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yosef Karo (1488 - 1575)states in Shulchan Aruch, (The Code of Jewish Law) that if a physician is able to heal a patient and refrains from doing so, <strong>this is considered murder</strong>. Yoreh Deah, 336:1</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Isserles (The Rema 1520 - 1572), writes on the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law), that any act involving touching or moving a \"gossess\" (a term referring to a patient close to death) is prohibited because such an act may hasten his death. He continues by stating that if the act does hasten death <strong>it is considered murder</strong>. (Yoreh Deah, 339:1)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (1895 - 1986), one of the greatest and mainstream authorities on Orthodox Jewish Law in recent times, based on the above Rema, comments: \"...even if the patient is suffering, [if an action is done to hasten his death] <strong>it is the crime of murder</strong>, and it is <strong>absolutely forbidden</strong> and he is liable to the punishment for murder… [This is true] even if (the sick person)is one who is suffering greatly and [the physician] murders with merciful intent and even if it is requested [by the patient].” Igros Moshe, Choshen Mishpat II, 83:1</p>\n\n<p>Orthodox Judaism certainly does not allow removal of life support in a person that will survive and be cured. (example, the violinist)</p>\n\n<p>Judaism teaches that we must obey morality as a responsibility. Protecting the violinist's life, outweighs personal inconvenience. Even though the violinist or kidnappers, may have done the wrong thing, the fact remains that human life must be preserved. (However, the violinist may be liable to pay his benefactor a hefty sum for damages.)</p>\n\n<p>In order to disconnect from the violinist, one would need to prove, from Torah sources, that their 9 months of inconvenience and loss, outweighs one human life. That's going to be pretty hard to do.</p>\n\n<p>Even secular courts understand this. If I am driving a car, and someone jumps in front of my path in the road and makes silly gestures at me etc. Do I run him over because he has no right to be in my way? What if my defense was that I needed to hit him with my car, because if I swerved, I would damage my car and need a few thousand dollars of repairs?</p>\n\n<p>BTW, Orthodox Judaism, does not forbid abortion in all cases. We do forbid abortion on demand, but may permit abortion for great need (like cases of saving the mother etc. This includes certain cases of rape according to some Orthodox Jewish opinions.) But that is not the focus of the OP. I am just pointing out that Thompson seems to assume as a given for the sake of her example, that a fetus does have the same right to life as a viable human after birth. Judaism does not agree with that across the board.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides (Rambam, 1135 - 1204) in his Code of Jewish Law, says that (based on the Talmud) if a baby is causing danger to the mother's life it should be aborted; however if its head has emerged, then the two lives are equal. Hilchos Rotzeach 1:9</p>\n\n<p>The Torah supports the idea that killing a fetus is wrong (but it is not a murder punishable by death). See Exodus 21:22, where the Torah forces someone who caused a miscarriage, to pay for monetary damages.</p>\n\n<p>However, Judaism does accept the sanctity of the life of a fetus. (and obviously a person) Therefore, we are responsible for the unborn life, and the violinist as well. The reason is that our focus on our responsibility to preserve life usually trumps the assumed fault of the living party. It is not about what is fair, rather, what is right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To consolidate the comments above: at first glance, Jewish law would prohibit unplugging the violinist too -- assuming being plugged in is no threat to your life. So it's kind of a moot point.</p>\n\n<p>We care about the situation at hand, not passing judgment on how it came about.</p>\n\n<p>(There is certainly discussion about pregnancies that threaten the mother's mental health, and a product of rape could certainly be in that category. But that still depends entirely on the mother's situation.)</p>\n\n<p>Jewish law may in fact be more lenient about an abortion than a plugged-in violinist as the latter was already \"fully living\", but that's a different discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

What type of zimun do they make after rejoining?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2015/08/10/zimun-joining-together/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> delves into some details on what constitutes \"eating together\" for the requirement of <em>zimun</em>. I see that there is a dispute regarding what happens when some people leave in the middle or others join at the end.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you have a group of 10 people travelling in 2 cars that follow each other constantly - 5 in each car. All 10 people stop at a rest stop, wash hands, and are about to sit together at a picnic table when they see a funnel cloud in the distance. They jump in their cars, and since they made the bracha for washing hands, they eat bread in the cars.</p>\n\n<p>About an hour later, they meet again at another rest stop. They don't eat anything, there.</p>\n\n<p>Can they make a joint 10 <em>zimun</em> saying <em>Elokenu</em>? (They washed together and had intent to begin together and they are one \"group\") Or, should each group of 5 make their own \"3-person\" <em>zimun</em> while riding in the car?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The 'eating together' that binds a group together for Zimmun would have to be eating. Preparing for the meal together, or performing any pre-meal prerequisites/rituals (such as washing hands) is not any form of <em>kvius</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Two groups of people who eat even in the same house (which two cars do not fit that description), can only be <em>mitztaref</em> for Zimmun if they could see each other. </p>\n\n<p>In two separate houses (which is the equivalent of two cars), the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1014\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> rules that they may join together if they can see each other, provided that the Reshus Harabim does not divide between the houses. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the street between the two cars will invalidate the Zimun.</p>\n\n\n",

Gottein's essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23586104\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Who were Muhammad's main teachers?</a>\" (Tarbitz 23:3/4), there's a little evidence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Islamic tradition tells us that the two largest Jewish \"tribes\" of the city [Almedina], Nadir and Qurayza, were <strong>kohanim</strong>. This is mentioned in dozens of stories and also in songs from the time of Muhammad. Dr. C. Z. Hirschberg, in his book \"Israel in Arabia\", pg. 167 and 309, doubted the historical credibility of this fact, for we have found that the Jews of Almedina didn't always follow the laws of family purity required of kohanim. But is Almedina any better than the district of Meishan in the land of Babylon, the center of Judaism, about which Chazal tell us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rather, the priests who were there were not particular with regard to the prohibition against priests marrying divorced women.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.72b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 72b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from where do we have evidence that this Jew of the Jews of Almedina, that didn't strictly follow, was a kohen like the rest of his brethren? The drash that is attributed to Rabbi Yochanan on the verse: \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.21.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In the steppe in Arab you will lodge</a>\" on the issue of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ta%27anit.25a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the pirchei kehunah who escaped to the Ishmaelites</a>, likely reflects not just the cruelty of the Nabateans during the time of the Second Temple, but also events that were closer to the time of the midrash. It seems to me that the Jews of Almedina, who were farmers, owners of date plantations, came there at a quite late era, perhaps due to to troubles from the Byzantine rulership; for the Jews of Arabia mentioned in the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.59a.3?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 59a</a>) were merchants, for their possessions included camels and perfume, while the Jews of Almedina were people of settlements of such form that they had to hire camels when they went into exile. It seems, therefore, that they came to Almedina as one group, perhaps from Yericho or another area in Emek Hayarden which grows dates (later, there are records that some of the refugees of Almedina came to Yericho). And now, the centralized settlement of kohanim, cities of kohanim, were known both in Israel and outside of it...the reason for this being most likely because it was easier to keep the laws of purity that were special to the kohanim in those times. There's some basis for this, that kohanim moved to the land of Arabia in entire groups...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'll add that it seems that S.D. Gottein was slightly mistaken, because while <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/h/9av/ju/What_Happened_to_the_Jews_of_Arabia.html#:%7E:text=The%20Jews%20of%20Medina%20were%20divided%20into%20three,from%20Mecca%20in%20622%2C%20he%20went%20to%20Medina.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the <em>Banu Nadir</em> were plantation owners, the <em>Banu Qurayza</em> were merchants</a>.</p>\n<p>So it seems that Arabian Jews were known in Israel around the time, and in particular, those who may have eventually (or perhaps even then) became known as the Banu Qurayza, who were merchants.</p>\n<p>In Mendel Wohlman's Mistarei Ha'aggadah, he writes on the story of Rabbah Bar Bar Chanah and the \"metei midbar\" (dead of the desert)(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.73b.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 73b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is very hard to imagine that these dead people, that RBB\"C saw were those who left Egypt and died in the desert, for after Rabbi Akiva ruled that they had no part in the World To Come (Sanhedrin 106), then they were evil people, and why would they earn the right to have their bodies preserves for thousands of years? However, we have heard that in the Arabian Desert there are Jews from the descendants of Rechav; these Rechavites, like all of the Jews of Yemen, wear all day long a tzitzit over their clothes and sleep with it also at night, and they are strong, armed warriors riding on camels and raiding caravans and extolling from them a tax (see the book Even Sapir). These Rechavites are the dead...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So that's another view, that Chazal were aware of caravan-raiding Arabian Jews. While the Banu tribes of Almedina were not known for being raiders, it's not such a far-fetched thought that this may have been what some of the Arabian Jews did at certain times, especially when considering:</p>\n<p>a. There were Jewish pirates and also Jewish Listim over history (and forget about the Jewish mafia and gangs of late 19th and 20th centuries).</p>\n<p>b. Caravan-raiding was (and is) quite common in Arabia (Muhammad was a caravan robber).</p>\n<p>c. As the kohanim of Almedina didn't rigidly follow the laws of family purity, it's possible that there were Jews who also didn't see any real problem with raiding caravans. It's also possible that these were sort of the \"enforcers\" of the rest of the Arabian Jews, who wandered the desert and attacked any passersby who may have posed a threat to the other Jews.</p>\n\n\n",

It's always a new, immensely painful drama. </p>\n\n<p>My rov does not seem willing to write a new chapter of the Shulchan Aruch for me. Every Yom Tov, I try my own modifications of the law to see what could work. The only thing that has allowed me to get through Yom Tov unscathed is to keep only the Biblical prohibitions; that is, to avoid doing avodas, but not melachos. (For example, I might turn on my light switch and take a nice hot bath, but I don't do my weekday \"laborious\" job.)  Yom Tov is genuinely enjoyable that way (as one might imagine). However, this involves so much secrecy and scurrying around that it feels dishonest and not exactly like a sustainable connection to religious Jewish life.</p>\n\n<p>What do people actually do?\nDoes everyone actually cheat?\nI can't imagine this is easy for everyone. Why don't I hear other complainers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Yeah, especially when a diaspora <em>yom tov</em> is adjacent to <em>Shabbat</em>, it sometimes feels like a long slog.  I sometimes feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle because I didn't do this from birth -- it isn't a life-long routine.  Here are some things that help me.  (Some of these are dependent on your family and community situations, which I don't know.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Board games.  While some games are hard to play without violating laws of <em>melacha</em>, many are just fine.  In a comment somebody suggested Settlers of Catan; that's one of many.  (This isn't <a href=\"https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/\">Board & Card Games</a>, so I'll refrain from giving you a list of recommendations.)  My husband and I are board-gamers and have several games that work well for two players; in addition, we often have friends over.  Secular friends aren't generally available on a Thursday afternoon (they're at work), but <em>Shabbat</em> afternoon we can often get a crowd.  (And the Jewish board-gamers often <em>are</em> available on <em>yom tov</em> afternoon.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Read.</p></li>\n<li><p>Visit with others, particularly around meals.  Extend those meals (in honor of the festival).  So what if lunch lasts three hours -- where else did you have to be?  If you've got the right kind of crowd, singing enhances this.</p></li>\n<li><p>Try to organize a small study/discussion group on the Jewish topic of your choice.

That's going to depend on your community, of course, but odds are, no -- those who commit to <em>torah</em> commit to doing their best to fulfill the <em>mitzvot</em> as understood by tradition.  I mean, you're being judged by the One who sees all, so sneaking around isn't going to help, right?  Does everybody do it all perfectly?  No.  Is everybody completely happy with how they're doing?  No.  As for why you don't hear about this from more people: people <em>do</em> talk about these challenges sometimes -- discussions about the press of preparing for <em>yom tov</em> aren't uncommon, for instance.  But my guess is that most people are not comfortable talking in detail about any struggles they're having in public, so even if people in your congregation do struggle, you might not hear.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I will start with the disclaimer that when I became religious, Yom Tov was a highlight for me, so I don't know how you will relate to what makes Yom Tov exciting for me.</p>\n\n<p>I am generally more of an intellectually-stimulated person, but something I found exciting about many <em>mitzvos</em>, but perhaps more so by Yom Tov, was understanding the meaning of the theme and <em>halachos</em> of the Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>First, there is the general theme of Yom Tov - what is the idea of a Yom Tov as opposed to a Shabbos? Rav Hirsch, in classic form, develops an approach that each Yom Tov has a unique quality which it is meant to imbue and reinforce in the Jewish people. Thus, Yom Tov has the prohibitions of Shabbos which prevent a person from getting distracted by every day involvements, but has an allowance of <em>ochel nefesh</em> - broadly, that which facilitates enjoying the Yom Tov - because the point of the day is to focus on and appreciate the day, not to abstain from involvement in the world for the sake of abstention (as opposed to Shabbos, where the goal of the prohibitions is abstention, with its own take-home message to that abstention).</p>\n\n<p>Then, there is the meaning of each individual Yom Tov. There is so much to delve into! There is the theme that our Sages have given to each Yom Tov, which we describe in the specific prayers of each Yom Tov. There is its place in the calendar. There are the myriad <em>halachos</em> of each Yom Tov. And each of these points has so many facets to it!</p>\n\n<p>So to sum it up, for me, appreciation of all the \"tediousness\" of Yom Tov makes it into something meaningful. As the Ramchal writes, a person doesn't appreciate something if they don't understand how it fits into a structure. Appreciating that all of the details of Yom Tov are part of a much bigger picture, and are an active part of taking out everything that Yom Tov has to offer, is what made (and still makes) Yom Tov exciting for me.</p>\n\n<p>Some places I would recommend to start - Horeb, of R' S.R. Hirsch. Works of R' Shimshon Pincus (accessible to the Hebrew speaking audience, but some works have been translated). The Book of Our Heritage, by Eliyahu Kitov. These are a good start, but there's always more to learn!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>My parents were observant from before I was born, and I have been Shabbat- and Yom-Tov-observant my whole life. I can honestly say that I don't believe I have ever intentionally violated either. So no, based on one counterexample from personal testimony, for what that's worth, not everyone cheats.</p>\n\n<p>I do find that observance of Shabbat and Yom Tov, especially together, presents difficulties. Observance of Yom Tov takes up most or all of my vacation days at work, making it difficult to take off for other, discretionary purposes. Preparing for Shabbat and Yom Tov in time is frequently a source of tension, and picking up the load of chores that couldn't be done during those times is frequently a source of distress after the holidays.</p>\n\n<p>However, I find that it is not difficult to <em>bring myself</em> to comply with the rules. I'm sure it helps that such compliance is a habit I have been reinforcing for literally my whole life.</p>\n\n<p>More generally, though, and hopefully more accessibly to those heroes who were raised without observance and are trying to bring themselves into it, I think that part of what makes it easy for me to bring myself to comply is that I don't consider it to be a choice: I am obligated to refrain from creative labor on Shabbat and Yom Tov, so I do; end of story. If I was deciding, in each instance, between observance and non-observance, I'm sure I would have to make many agonizing decisions, but because I consider the rules to be binding, I don't have to make any.</p>\n\n<p>One aspect of this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ulysses pact</a> that was particularly valuable to me: When I was in high school and college, I understood/assumed (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28910/learning-non-jewish-topics-as-a-creative-process\">correctly or not</a>) that I should not do homework for my secular classes on Shabbat, even when it was just reading. As a result, I never did. I attended a college that presented an intense workload, and I know that if I had considered avoiding study on Shabbat to be optional, I would have succumbed to the pressure and studied on Shabbat occasionally, and then routinely, as I saw other Shabbat-observant people around me who didn't make the same assumption about studying doing. Because I did absolutely no school work on that one day each week, it felt like a real sanctuary to me and did a great deal to keep me sane through college.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, I heard a story once (OK, probably more than once) in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rakeffet-Rothkoff\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Rakeffet</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/browse/browse.cfm#speaker=80135&lang=cfm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lectures</a> about when he participated in a panel discussion about marriage, along with a non-religious marriage counselor. (Please excuse my imperfect paraphrase from memory.) In his remarks, R' Rakeffet described the great benefit to the health of a marriage that <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm#Niddah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>taharat hamishpacha</em></a>'s regular rhythm of physical separation followed by joyous reunion provides. The marriage counselor was very impressed with the concept, and told him that she might start suggesting observing such a regime to her clients. R' Rakeffet told her that unfortunately, it was unlikely to work. Observant couples keep to the rules, and reap the associated benefit, because they consider the rules to be mandated by God. If a couple would try to comply just for the sake of the anticipated benefit to their marriage, they would inevitably reach a situation in which they felt they had to rationalize setting aside the rules just once, which would naturally lead to the discipline of the overall regime breaking down.</p>\n\n<p>So recognizing and committing to the set of rules as an absolute mandate from God is an important, possibly crucial, aspect of enabling oneself to actually comply with them in each instance and of avoiding the agony of repeated decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, achieving such a recognition and making such a commitment is far from trivial. To that end, I think that, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65685/how-to-have-an-easier-time-with-yom-tov/65692#65692\">yEz's answer</a> suggests, studying the \"what\"s, \"how\"s, and \"why\"s of the mandate could make it easier to understand and accept. Like yEz, I recommend <a href=\"http://www.judaicapress.com/products/horeb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Horeb</em></a>, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>, as a great distillation of the \"what\"s, \"how\"s, and \"why\"s of all of the Torah's laws. He goes into great detail about the nature of the prohibitions of labor on Shabbat and each of the holidays, and the particular rules and meanings that apply to each individually and to all of them collectively. I'll close with part of his explanation of the overall theme of the cessation of labor on the holidays.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The common factor of all of these days is that they all interrupt our active life in order to consecrate and equip us by obliging us to contemplate the truths lying at the foundation of our existence; and to endow us with strength for the remaining activities of life. This is just what makes them into Mo'adim. From this general Mo'ed characteristic arises the prohibition of work on all of them. For every activity which the Torah calls 'servile work' (מלאכת עבודה) transforms the objects around us, a process which the Mo'adim should interrupt. Therefore, every activity which continues life in a workaday fashion, through which the world around one is transformed and its future preserved, is forbidden on the Mo'ed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup><em>Horeb</em>, sub-section 171, p. 90</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Asking for something in prayers\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've never really liked the idea of asking for personal things when praying. I feel it's kind of selfish to ask for personal problems when there are people in the world in much worse situations. What I think while praying (besides thanking and praising G-d) is that I give Him my tefilah and he knows better where (or when) to use it.</p>\n\n<p>I never saw this as a bad thing, but I once read that some rabbi said that: \"a prayer that doesn't ask for a different thing each day isn't valid\". And in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/47901/11052\">this answer</a> I found, it says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rebbe Nachman of Breslov has many specific teachings on prayer [...] one should pray for any physical thing one needs, even something as insignificant as a missing button on one's coat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really don't feel comfortable when asking G-d for personal things. I believe that if I'm sick, if lost something or if anything bad happened to me, it happened because I deserved it. If G-d is completely righteous and fair, how could I tell Him that I deserve more? Shouldn't I just accept what G-d gives me without asking for more?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is acknowledging that everything that we have is based on Hashem granting it. Every one has needs and desires that must be taken care of. It is appropriate to ask Hashem to help us understand which ones are appropriate and to help us merit the fulfillment of those desires. Note that Moshe Rabbeinu asked to be allowed to go into the land. In the story of Yishmael, the meforshim teach that a sick person's prayer for health is heeded more readily than someone elses prayer for that sick person. Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin’s useful book points out  the Talmud mentions eleven sages and the supplications that each customarily added to the Shemoneh Esrei (Berakhot 16b-17a). The prayer of Mar, son of Rabina, a fourth-century rabbi, became a favorite and found its way into the prayer book at the end of the Amidah.

All these and similar matters cannot be definitely known by man until they occur for these matters are undefined in the prophets' words and even the wise men have no established tradition regarding these matters except their own interpretation of the verses. Therefore, there is a controversy among them regarding these matters.</p>\n  \n  <p><sub>Translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188357/jewish/Chapter-12.htm\">Chabad.org</a></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two related questions:</p>\n\n<p>1) Where is Eliyahu's arrival debated that you could describe it as \"some Sages\" and \"controversy\"? Presumably the Rambam learns from the Bar Kochba events, where Eliyahu Hanavi didn't make an appearance that it is, in fact, uncertain when in the process he will arrive, but is this actually explicitly argued anywhere?</p>\n\n<p>2) In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=6&hilchos=32&perek=4&halocha=11&hilite=\">Hilchos Nazir 4:11</a> the Rambam says that someone who vows that he will be a Nazir on the day \"The son of Dovid comes on\" is a Nazir from that day forward, unless he makes the vow on Shabbos or Yom Tov. Because there is a Safek if Moshiach can come on those days, his vow only starts the day after (but is effective even on Shabbos and Yom Tov subsequently). What is the doubt about Shabbos and Yom Tov? The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=84122&rid=5777\">Kesef Mishna</a>, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=96461&rid=5777\">Midgal Oz</a>, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=52552&rid=5777\">Radbaz</a>, etc. all point to the doubt about whether or not there is \"Techumin\" above. If there is, then Eliyahu HaNavi can't come on Shabbos and Yom Tov, so Moshiach can't come that day.</p>\n\n<p>So from this we see clearly that Eliyahu HaNavi is an integral part of Moshaich's arrival and not subject a matter for which there is no clear tradition.</p>\n\n<p>So which is it? How exactly does the Rambam understand Eliyahu HaNavi's timing in the arrival of Moshiach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One source is:</p>\n<p>Yerushalmi Eruvin 34b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁאנֵי הָתָם, דְּאָמַר קְרָא: ״הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי שֹׁלֵחַ לָכֶם אֵת\nאֵלִיָּה הַנָּבִיא וְגוֹ׳״, וְהָא לָא אֲתָא אֵלִיָּהוּ מֵאֶתְמוֹל. The\nGemara answers: It is different there, as the verse stated: “Behold I\nwill send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and\ndreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the fathers\nto the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers”\n(Malachi 3:23–24). This verse teaches that Elijah will arrive the day\nbefore the coming of the Messiah.

(See\nSedei Chemed, Kelalei ha-Poskim vol. 9, siman 5. See also numerous\nsuch references in the Tosafot Yom Tov; Rashba, Ketubot 48a, s.v. amar\nRav; idem, Nedarim 46a, s.v. mistavra; Ritva, Moed Katan 8b, s.v. ika\nbeinaihu; Yam Shel Shlomo, Yevamot 8:18; Penei Yehoshua, Gittin 84b,\ns.v. ve-nir’eh le-Ri; Chatam Sofer, Avodah Zarah 34a, s.v. ve-ana\nkevedah [perhaps].) The more I immerse myself in the study of Talmud,\nthe more I understand the reference to the “sea of the talmud.” It is\nnot called a “sea of Talmud” because (as some have joked) it is so\neasy to drown in it. Rather it is because no matter how much time you\nspend in it, it is so hard to understand its many currents, ebbs and\nflows. Just when you think you understand how the sea works, you learn\nsomething new about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But when they told her he used the phrase 'Pakod Yifkod' she said to believe. - If so what was the point of the signs at all?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65702/did-moshe-need-to-do-all-3-signs-for-the-jewish-people-and-if-so-why/88281#88281\">my first answer</a> before you read this...</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Caspi's approach:</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Caspi here provides the simplest answer to the philosophical question raised above.  Hashem of course knows that they will need all three signs, and he is speaking \"Kelashon Benei Adam\", in the language of man.  What is even more interesting in his approach to this story is the understanding of the nation believing. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיה לדם ביבשת – הנה לא באר שיאמינו אחרי זה השלישי, ועוד כתוב ויאמן העם, היחכן שיהיה דבר לעתיד לא ידעו השם קודם היותו וחלילה, אמנם נשמט זה במקום הזה, למה שידע השם כי אותה ההאמנה לכלל המון העם, לא היתה ההאמנה רק על דרך העברה, והראיה ע״ז כי במעט רוח נעקרה, עד שאמרו למשה ירא י״י, גם כתוב אח״כ ולא שמעו אל משה, ולכן להעירנו ע״ז השמיט מלומר במקום הזה ואז יאמינו, ואעפ״כ צדק אמרו ויאמן העם, איזו אמונה שהיתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What he basically says is that even after all three signs, the nation believed only partially or \"some sort of belief\".  He supports this by noting that despite the verse 4:31 stating that they believed, in 4:9 Hashem does not say that they will believe him after the third sign.  We also see later on (6:9) that they did not listen to Mosheh because of the mental state they were in because of the hard work. \nHe repeats this specifically in 4:31:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמן העם – אי זה אמונה שהיתה כמו שביארנו למעלה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, all three were performed because Hashem knew that the nation would not believe, and in fact, they only believed a bit after all three. Ibn Caspi certainly does not subscribe to the Maamar Chazal in this case, as he seems to conclude that they did not really believe, even after \"Ki Pakad Hashem Es Benei Yisrael\" (4:31)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>READ ME FIRST:</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of unclear points in this story, I will try to provide some clarity to it based on my understanding of the points made by the Mefarshim. Due to the length, I would like to post them as separate answers, and MY readers can vote on answers based on their content.</p>\n\n<p>The 3 signs, as you mentioned, are explained in Shemos 4:2-9.  Of those verses, two are of special importance to this conversation, verses 8 (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/4.8#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentaries here</a>) and 9 (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/4.9#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentaries here</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4:8 - וְהָיָה֙ אִם־לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ לָ֔ךְ וְלֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ לְקֹ֖ל\n  הָאֹ֣ת הָרִאשׁ֑וֹן וְהֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ לְקֹ֖ל הָאֹ֥ת הָאַחֲרֽוֹן׃</p>\n  \n  <p>The Lord said to Moses, If they do not believe you and are not\n  convinced by the first miraculous sign, they will be convinced by the\n  second sign (NLT)</p>\n  \n  <p>4:9 - וְהָיָ֡ה אִם־לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֡ינוּ גַּם֩ לִשְׁנֵ֨י הָאֹת֜וֹת\n  הָאֵ֗לֶּה וְלֹ֤א יִשְׁמְעוּן֙ לְקֹלֶ֔ךָ וְלָקַחְתָּ֙ מִמֵּימֵ֣י\n  הַיְאֹ֔ר וְשָׁפַכְתָּ֖ הַיַּבָּשָׁ֑ה וְהָי֤וּ הַמַּ֙יִם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר\n  תִּקַּ֣ח מִן־הַיְאֹ֔ר וְהָי֥וּ לְדָ֖ם בַּיַּבָּֽשֶׁת׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And if they don’t believe you or listen to you even after these two\n  signs, then take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the\n  dry ground. When you do, the water from the Nile will turn to blood on\n  the ground. (NLT)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra's approach:</p>\n\n<p>The first point that needs to be addressed is the following philosophical issue: Obviously, Hashem knows how many signs they will need in order to believe, so why bother telling Mosheh this?  Just tell him to do the number of signs that it will take.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra explains that God was saying this in order to reassure Mosheh - Hashem is basically saying \"if you will be nervous that they will not accept you after just one sign, so perform the second and third signs\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם לא יאמינו – ידענו כי השם ידע כל העתידות, רק הדיבור כנגד משה. אחר שאמרא לו השם: ושמעו לקולך (שמות ג׳:י״ח), אמר משה מפחד אני שלא ישמעו כולם בקולי.\n  ואם לא יאמינו – טעמו: אם תאמר שלא יאמינו, וכן: והיה אם לא יאמינו (שמות ד׳:ט׳).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He basically says that Hashem knows how many signs, but does not specify, because it doesn't matter.  What is important is that technically speaking Mosheh might not know whether or not all of those present will accept it fully, and this is for Mosheh, so when it comes to performing the signs, he performs them all for the nation (likely to ease his own fears), as specifically stated by Ibn Ezra there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...ויעש האותות – המטה, ואות היד, ולקח מים מהיאור והיה לדם ביבשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, all three were performed, in order for Moshe to calm his mind. Ibn Ezra likely does not subscribe to this view of Chazal, as he does not mention it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65702/did-moshe-need-to-do-all-3-signs-for-the-jewish-people-and-if-so-why/88281#88281\">my first answer</a> before you read this...</p>\n\n<p>Ralbag's approach:</p>\n\n<p>Ralbag's understanding of this story is much simpler, and unrelated to how he deals with our philosophical question raised above.  According to Ralbag, these signs showed the nation that an honest prophet had come forward (meaning he would predict these signs would happen, and they would come true, 4:5).  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר אליו שיעשה זה האות בפני בני ישראל, למען יאמינו כי נראה אליו ה׳ יתעלה, כי הודעת חידוש המופתים קודם חידושם לא תגיע כי אם לנביא, כמו שביארנו בששי מספר מלחמות ה׳ (מאמר ששי חלק ב פרקים יא, יג).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem showed Mosheh these signs to prove to Benei Yisrael that Mosheh was a Navi Emes by \"probability\".  The Ralbag essentially says that to predict one of these signs correctly would be unlikely, but technically possible for it to happen by chance.  To predict 2 of these in a row would be highly unlikely, but still technically possible.  To have Mosheh predict 3 in a row would be (so close to) impossible by chance if he was not a Navi.  Here are his words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם לא יאמינו גם לשני האותות האלה, ויאמרו שכבר אפשר היות הידיעה בהם למשה בקרי, הנה נתן ה׳ יתעלה למשה אות שלישי, והוא שישפוך ביבשה ממימי היאור ויהפכו לדם ביבשה. וזה ממה שלא יתכן שיאמרו שלא יהיה בְּדרך נבואה מה שהודיעם משה מאלו האותות, כי לא יתכן שיגיע הצדק בדבריו במקרה באלו השלושה דברים יחד, וזה מבואר בנפשו, כי לא יתכן במה שבמקרה שיהיה בו מאֹדִיּוּת וריבוי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presumably then, all three were required to prove to the nation without doubt that he was a Navi from Hashem by predicting all 3 in advance.  Two would still be a remote enough possibility that it could be by chance.  Again, Ralbag likely does not follow Chazal here.</p>\n\n\n",

(This interpretaion likely seems obvious for vowels (eg. חָלָב and חֵלֶב) and the Rama presents vowels and trop together, so the extension is highly plausible.) I don't know of anyone who argues on this.</p>\n\n<p>(Interestingly, the Mishna Berura is quoting the Shulchan Atzei Shittim whose example of a mistake that changes the meaning is reading a conjunctive trop instead of a disjunctive trop. While it may seem that he means <em>any</em> such switch, it's hard to see why, for example, reading Vayomer with a Merkha in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 15:7</a>, even if non-standard, would change the meaning.

    "content": "# What are Acceptable Uses of Tzeddakah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Maimonides opined that there are eight levels of tzedakah: From the lowest level of giving charity unwillingly or begrudgingly to the highest level of offering a loan, partnership or job to help another to eventually support themselves and their family independently. Furthermore, there are Jewish traditions that the degree of charity is relative to a receipiant's status in life. As such, a person who lost their wealth should be supported to the degree that would allow them to sustain their current life-style. In addition, there are times that the concept of tzedakah is merged with that of mitzvot. (Tzedakah is a mitzvah, but not all mitzvot are tzeddakah).</p>\n\n<p>What are acceptable uses of charity? I understand the concept of once giving charity, just as a gift---unless conditional---is no longer the property of the giver, but I am not completely convinced that applies here. Of course the Maimonides Levels of Tzedakah provides some direct or implied answers to my question, but I am seeking a more thorough explaination.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples of use of tzedakah:</p>\n\n<p>Volunteering in a homeless shelter.\nVolunteering your master-chef skills in a homeless shelter \nA yeshiva using donations to throw the \"Best Channukah Party Ever\"\nA shul using donations to fix the roof.

A ticket to a movie?\nAn organization uses donations to secure counsil for their Rosh Yeshiva who was recently charged with money laundering and real estate fraud\nGiving a car ride to someone who doesn't have the money for fare.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT. Not sure why this issue has been raised four years later. The difference is my question touches upon what I believe are examples that stretch the definition of tzedakah to the point that it is possible that people are distorting the concept of a mitzvah. My question I believe is more consistent with the one asked several days ago by a different poster.</p>\n\n\n",

But with all due respect going to the theater itself may be the greater chilul Hashem, as the Gemara in Avodah Zarah (19b) clearly states that going transgresses the Torah prohibition of Leitzanus. I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m being too strong - I’m just trying to help a fellow Jew because I care. The reward for holding back even though it’s enticing is greater than we can possibly fathom.

    "content": "# Why Doesn't Judaism Have A Call To Prayer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there anything in the Torah or the Talmud forbidding Judaism from establishing a call to prayer (of the type Islam has)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There were various methods used to wake people for prayer and to announce the times.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://strangeside.com/prayer-waking-people-up-to-pray/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prayer – waking people up to pray</a> gives the following examples.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What happened when there was  a need to wake up an entire tzibbur  on\n  a daily basis? During Medieval  times, this was the of the\n  shulklappers (a term first appears in a non-Jewish published in 1225)\n  whose was to klap (knock) on peoples’ shutters and doors to indicate\n  it was time to get up and shul. This was generally the shamash of the\n  shul. The profession  must have been common as surnames  like\n  Shulklapper and Klapper are still extant.</p>\n  \n  <p>The custom of rousing people up for  avodah and prayer extends all the\n  way  back to the Bais Hamikdosh. Among the  people appointed over\n  various duties in  the Bais Hamikdosh, the Mishnah (Shekalim  5:1)\n  counts Gevini the Announcer,  whom, the Yerushalmi (ibid) explains, \n  used to cry out every morning, “Rise,  Kohanim, for the sacrificial\n  service,  Levi’im to sing, and Yisroel to stand by  [as\n  representatives of the nation].” ...</p>\n  \n  <p>It has been claimed that the custom of  waking people with a\n  shulklapper died  at the end of the 19th century and that its  only\n  remnant are antique shulklapper  hammers on display in museums.  This\n  is not strictly true. The shulklapper  persists in modern guise.\n  Instead of  old time shulklappers racing through the  marketplace\n  warning shops to close up,  Shabbos niggunim now waft from\n  loudspeakers  to apprise people when Shabbos  or Yom Tov are about to\n  begin. Although  funerals are no longer announced  by a klap at the\n  door, some communities  still announce them from car-mounted \n  loudspeakers.</p>\n  \n  <p>And even Selichos have not been  forgotten. Every year, R. Eizik Fried\n  of Kiryas Belz makes the rounds of his  Yerushalayim kehillah in his\n  car. As a  concession to modernity and perhaps due  to the height of\n  the apartment buildings,  he has replaced the shulklapper’s hammer \n  with a speaker on his car from which  the ancient words still\n  resonate: Yisroel  am kodosh, kumu la.avodas haborei.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is the recognition that different prayer times (within a range) may work for different people. The Talmud praises those who start the morning prayers super-early so they reach the middle part right at sunrise, however it's also acknowledged that's not something we can expect everyone to do. As long as you get those prayers in sometime in the three hours after sunrise, that's still acceptable. So there's no one time at which you would be shouting out to the town, \"wake up for prayers!\"</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the afternoon prayers could be anywhere from ~1pm until sunset. So you could sound an alarm \"we've now reached the earliest time for afternoon prayers!\", or \"it's 15 minutes until the last possible time for prayers, hurry up if you haven't yet done so!\", but there's no one set time.</p>\n\n<p>(In something structured like a school dormitory however, everyone is expected to be at the structured prayer service, and there will be a wake-up call accordingly.)</p>\n\n<p>There are towns in Israel that have sirens or the like to announce the Sabbath is about to start, on Friday afternoon. And the Talmud speaks similarly of trumpets to warn people that Passover is beginning soon, they have to get rid of their bread. But those are clearly-demarcated deadlines, whereas prayer times are ranges.</p>\n\n\n",

It calls it \"Halachah\" or binding Jewish law!</p>\n      \n      <p>The Talmudic rabbi most instrumental in persuading rabbis today to indulge in pedophilia is 2nd century A.D. Simeon ben Yohai.  It's hard to imagine a rabbinic sage more esteemed than ben Yohai. He is credited by Ultra-Orthodox Jews as the author of the Zohar, or Kabbalah.  Every year in Meron in Israel (where ben Yohai died), more than 10,000 Hasidic Jews gather for a week of singing, dancing, and praising ben Yohai, who may well be Kabbalist Judaism's most venerated authority.  </p>\n      \n      <p>In Orthodox Judaism, the most ancient first and second A.D. rabbis, the \"Tannaim,\" are considered most authoritative. This is largely because they lived in Palestine closest in time to the Pharisees, who, originating in Babylon, created the Mishnah (oral law), which later became written down as the Babylonian Talmud. Some “Tanna” receive greater respect from Orthodox Jews than does Moses. Jesus accused the oral law of \"making the law of God of none effect.\"</p>\n      \n      <p>The Talmud is the greatest religious authority for observant Jews today. It teaches that when sages of ben Yohai’s stature pronounced new laws, they did so out of the memory of what God had taught them in heaven. The Talmud says such memory was imparted to ben Yohai's teacher, Rabbi Akiba: when Moses died he went to heaven and beheld Rabbi Akiba “expounding wondrously on the Torah.” Thus, when ben Yohai authorizes pedophilia in the Talmud, such permission becomes law for Orthodox Jews for all time.</p>\n      \n      <p>In Yebamoth 60b the Talmud says:</p>\n      \n      <p>It was taught: R.

Therefore, any girl who converts to Judaism below the age of three has the legal status of a Jewish virgin and may marry a <em>kohein</em> in R' Shim'on's opinion (see <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r3604.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Y'rushalmi Kiddushin</em> 4:6</a>, \"רבי שמעון אומר עד שיבואו בתולים בקדושת ישראל\").</p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In any case, Judaism prohibits sexual relations with a minor girl, whether above or below the age of three.

The Rivash also rules that marriage to a minor girl is formally prohibited (§193, \"דדרך בני אדם להקפיד שלא להשיא בנותיהן בקטנותן וגם שיש לו אסור בדבר מדברי רב יהודה עד שתגדיל\"; see also §199), as does the <em>Taz</em> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7636\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>EH</em> 37:5</a>, based on the Ran).</p>\n<p>Regardless of the precise nature of the talmudic exhortation not to marry minor girls, some communities during medieval times (and even as late as the 17th century)<sup>7</sup> felt the need to marry off their daughters as soon as they could, even while they were children (see <em>Tosafos</em> on <em>Kiddushin</em> 41a, s.v. \"אסור לאדם שיקדש את בתו\"; <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7636\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rama <em>EH</em> 37:8</a>). The reason for this was the extremely precarious nature of the safety and finances of Jews in Europe during that period; if a father acquired enough capital to pay his daughter's dowry, he would immediately marry her off before her marriage prospects could be compromised by his money being stolen or confiscated by the state - or worse.</p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In any case, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/75381\">later authorities</a> have decried the practice of marrying off one's minor daughter, and they have stressed the prohibition against it. R' Ya'akov Emden (18th century, <em>Sh'eilas Ya'beitz</em> I, §14, \"לדידן לא שנא קידושין וכ\"ש נישואין בתרווייהו לא שפיר דמי למיעבד עובדא בקטנה ממש\") and the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> (19th c, <em>EH</em> 37:33, \"בזמנינו אין מקדשין את הקטנות ולא שמענו מעולם מי שיקדש את הקטנה ונכון הוא דבש\"ס [מ\"א א] איתא דאסור לקדשה כשהיא קטנה... אין זה נכון וכן המנהג פשוט בזמנינו במדינתינו\") have ruled that it is wrong for a man to marry a minor in this day and age regardless of leniencies that were employed in some communities during the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p>In the social and psychological context of modern times, it is known that it would be psychologically damaging and traumatic for a minor girl (or even a girl well past the age of 12) to be married. Leaving aside the technical considerations discussed heretofore in this answer, putting a young girl in a marriage or sexual relationship would therefore be a violation of multiple tenets of Judaism, including the precept to love one's fellow as oneself (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0319.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Vayikra</em> 19:18</a>), to do that which is just and good (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>D'varim</em> 6:18</a>), and not to torment one's fellow (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0325.htm#17\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Vayikra</em> 25:17</a>).</p>\n<p>Additionally, although there are various opinions as to the extent of this obligation (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/60234\">this answer</a> and answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9817\">this question</a>), Jewish law requires a Jew to observe secular law in the jurisdiction to which the Jew is subject. This would be yet another reason to prohibit such relationships in this day and age.</p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Circling back around to your question about that website misrepresenting the Talmud and Jewish law, the website was wrong in multiple ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The <em>halacha</em> in this case does not follow R' Shim'on but instead follows the Rabbis (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=27&perek=18\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Rambam</em>, <em>Hil. Issurei Bi'ah</em> 18:1</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A child under three cannot be married to a <em>kohein</em> or anyone else. The age of three has technical relevance as discussed in section I. above.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to R' Shim'on, woman who had converted to Judaism before the age of three can marry either a <em>kohein</em> or a non-<em>kohein</em>, and there is no reason for a <em>kohein</em> to prefer her over anyone else. (According to the Rabbis, only a non-<em>kohein</em> may marry her).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Talmudic Jews determine the halacha not simply by reading Tannaitic literature, but by considering the entire corpus of Jewish law all the way until contemporary times.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Jewish law does not endorse pedophilia, and the Talmud castigates those who would \"play\" with young girls. Although teenage marriage was common during much of Jewish history, and some medieval communities took the legally controversial approach of marrying off their preteen daughters, Jewish law would not sanction behavior that is understood to be psychologically unhealthy, traumatic, or illegal.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The website that produced the claims in your question is <a href=\"http://truthtellers.org/israel.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">anti-Semitic</a> and anti-Israel. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31056\">This answer</a> by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1362/danno\">Danno</a> discusses this general sort of attack on the Talmud and Judaism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These attacks are usually amalgamations of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Pure invention -- some of the books listed don't exist or the quotes are fabrications</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Mistranslations or selective quoting</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Out of context quotes (statements made in the course of a protracted legal argument presented as definitive statements of belief or statements made to make a legal point being cited as normative practice).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are plenty of sites which go through \"quotes\" like these and explain them one at a time.

Additionally, the Jerusalem Talmud (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r3604.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Kiddushin</em> 46a</a>) explicitly renders the <em>b'raisa</em>'s quote as, \"a female convert <em>who had converted</em> below three years and one day...\" (\" תני בשם ר' שמעון גיורת שנתגיירה פחותה מבת שלש שנים ויום אחד כשירה לכהונה\").</sub></p>\n<p><sub>The Talmud brings R' Shim'on's opinion to contrast with the opinion of the other Rabbis who rule that a <em>kohein</em> may not marry a convert regardless of the age at which she converted; according to the Rabbis, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/22496\">all female converts have the status of <em>zona</em></a> with respect to marrying a <em>kohein</em>. </sub></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>This verse describes the aftermath of the Israelites' retributive war against Midian (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0431.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>B'midbar</em> 31</a>).

According to R' Shim'on bar Yochai's opinion, the phrase \"keep them alive for yourselves\" implies that all female Midianite captives who were captured below the age of three could eventually be suitable marriage partners for all the soldiers in the war. Since Pinchas was a <em>kohein</em>, and he participated in the war, this implies that these women would be permissible for marriage to <em>kohanim</em>.

Period. The citation to Yevamoth lead you no where relevant. Another false allegation is than usually brought further by falsely quoting Ketuvot 11b. I bring it here for the rounding out the question to the broader issue of people trying to use false quotation of the talmud to somehow prove it supports pedophilia. Ketovot11b describes a different situation than usually depicted: it describes the situation where a minor boy has relations with a female adult. Nowhere will you find a discussion about whether such a relation is permitted; the quote \"Sexual intercourse with a little girl is permitted if she is three years of age.\" is completely fictional. the passage only deals with the consequence a-posteriori: IF such a thing has happened, what consequence does it have for: 1) the dowry and 2) whether such a female can marry a cohen.</p>\n<p>The discussion is very technical, but ultimately not relevant to the issue raised against the talmud. Nowhere is it stated that such a relation is ever allowed. A translation of relevant passages from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.11b?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ketuvot 11b from sefaria</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A. Rav Judah said that Rav said:  A young boy who has intercourse with\nan adult woman makes her [as though she were] injured by a piece of\nwood.  When I said this before Shmuel he said:  There is no such thing\nas “injured by a piece of wood” when done by flesh. Some teach this\nteaching on its own: [As to] a young boy who has intercourse with an\nadult woman: Rav said:... He makes her [as though she were] injured by\na piece of wood; whereas Shmuel said:  There is no such thing as\n“injured by a piece of wood” when done by flesh. Oshaia objected:\nWhen an adult has had sexual intercourse with a young girl, or when a\nsmall boy has had intercourse with an adult woman, or a girl who was\ninjured by a piece of wood — [in all these cases] their kethubah is\ntwo hundred [zuz], the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say:  a girl\nwho was injured by a piece of wood — her kethubah is a maneh Rava\nsaid. It means this: When adult man has intercourse with a young girl\nit is nothing, for when the girl is less than this, it is like putting\na finger into the eye.... But when a young boy has intercourse with an\nadult woman he makes her as “a girl who is injured by a piece of\nwood.” And “a girl injured by a piece of wood” is a dispute between R.\nMeir and the Sages. Rami b. Hama said: The dispute is only when he\nknew that she was [a mukat etz], for R. Meir compares her to a mature\ngirl, and the Sages compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a\nman.  But if he did not know that she was a [mukat etz] , all agree\nthat she receives nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is very ironic that one of the great passages about mercy to the victims of pedophile rape has become the thing the enemies of the jewish people use against us.</p>\n<p>This passage does not approve anything. The perpetrator is still guilty of the grave sin of sexual relations outside of marriage. What the rabbis are saying here is that the girl should not be forbidden from marriage later because she has been abused; they must treat her as though she had been injured by something else and not hold the pedophylia against her because it isnt her fault. She is to be treated as a marraigable virgin while the punishment for the man who harmed her is discussed in another part of the Talmud. The same is true for a young boy who is molested. He is not to be considered as though he had had intercourse, but is to be allowed to marry later withoit holding the rape against him; again, the pedophile's punishment is discussed in another section of the Law...</p>\n<p>Now there is no doubt about whether it is a sin to have sex for lust only; it is as clear as day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952874/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Mishne Thora, Sefer Nashim, Ishut, chapter 1, halacha 4:</a></p>\n<p>Therefore, a person who has relations with a woman for the sake of\nlust, without kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah,\nbecause he had relations with a harlot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>there are certain halachas regarding who is considered a virgin.</p>\n\n<p>a girl who had sex after 3 is no longer a virgin. but if she had sex before then (by rape or whatever), the virginity grows back and she retains her status as a virgin and can later on marry a high priest who is required to marry a virgin.</p>\n\n<p>as for that quote, in those days, there was great promiscuity among the gentiles and so any woman who comes to convert was assumed to have committed a forbidden sexual relation regardless of her age.</p>\n\n<p>but sex with a girl under 3 is not considered sex since the virginity grows back. so even if she was raped by a nutcase such as the one who wrote that article, then she is permitted to marry a priest, who is required to marry a woman who never had forbidden sexual relations.</p>\n\n<p>the verse of midian refers to keeping alive the girls who never reached this status.</p>\n\n\n",

David considered himself duty bound in this way when his father in law, King Saul, was trying to kill him.  When Saul walked into a cave where David was hiding, David had the opportunity to kill Saul first, but, instead, cut off a piece of Saul's skirt.  When Saul left the cave, David ran after him.  He presented the piece of cloth as evidence that he could have killed Saul, but did not, saying, \"See, my father!  Also, see the skirt of your coat in my hand, for in that  I severed the skirt of your coat and I did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, but you are stalking my soul to take it.\" <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15853/jewish/Chapter-24.htm#v=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">1 Samuel 24:12</a>. But David might well be excused by his father-in-law's conduct towards him; the Shuchan Aruch, at Yoreh Deah 240:19 advises parents to not to be too demanding.  I have seen couples break up because a son took his mother's side over his wife's on every issue where they disagreed.  Consistent with both rules, a daughter- or son-in-law should always be respectful to their in-laws, and the in-laws should remember that their child is a grown-up and should be given liberty to make decisions with his or her spouse that might vary from time to time with your sage counsel (recognize, your child is also getting advice from his or her in-laws, and must respect them as well).  </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud reflects that getting along with the in-laws is not easy.  At <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/rst/moed/13d%20-%20Eruvin%20-%2079b-105b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eruvin 86a</a>, the discussion is about establishing an eeruv within a court yard shared by homeowners,  and whether the absence of one home owner (and his non-participation in the weekly eruv setting) effects the status of the eruv.  In the Mishna, Rav Shimon rules that the eruv is unaffected (the absent owner is not needed to participate) if one owner leaves his home to visit his married daughter because we know he has no intent to return before Shabbat is over.  The Gemara agrees, but Rav notes that if the homeowner went to visit his married son, we assume he will have a fight with his daughter-in-law and will be back before Shabbat ends.  Hence, his participation in the making of the eruv is essential.</p>\n\n\n",

An example would be the blessing from the Amidah</p>\n\n<p>\"מֵבִיא גוֹאֵל\" It would normally be \"גּוֹאֵל\" but the gimmel loses its dagesh because of the word מֵבִיא. So in my humble opinion, it should be כָל חַי. But maybe the authors of the siddurim changed the spelling on purpose because of how weird it sounds to them and Ashkenazim in general. So it's up to you, if you want to follow the rules of dikduk, go with כָל חַי. But if you want to go with what your community does, then do כָּל חַי. </p>\n\n\n",

Then it adds, this is only during Tefilla <em>because one shouldn't change from how the Chachamim coined things</em> but during private requests there is no issue.</p>\n\n<p>The odd thing is that the Gemara describes it as a problem because you would be leaving things out and the Shulchan Aruch offers a completely different reason, that the issue is veering from the designated text. If this is the whole reason, we wouldn't have picked out adding to Hashem's titles.</p>\n\n<p>The answer lies in the way the Beis Yosef explains this. He quotes the Ri Abuhav that when it is your own request it can be seen as trying to evoke the titles pertaining to your request. Therefore your goal is not to describe the extent of Hashem's greatness. Whereas as a standalone Tefila the purpose is to mention Hashem's greatness.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Beis Yosef seems to take the Ri's opinion further than this, and allows Piyutim full of original praises.</p>\n\n<p>This matches the Tosfos Yom Tov who applies the same standard to saying, \"Your pity reached the bird-nest.\" He explains that when said during a Tefila you are proclaiming this as <em>the</em> reason, but as a Drush reason it is fine. The Tosfos Yom Tov says that he sees this from Rashi who adds, בתפילתו.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, if so, Rashi holds like the Ri that these are only issues when you veer from the established Nusach and are therefore making a point and a loud statement about these outlooks. Rashi's seeming derogatory description about the individual is because we are always discouraged from changing the established Nusach. But we are intervening only when there is a bigger issue.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Rashi is letting us know that the issue is, in part, because this person is veering from the norm.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Art Scroll 33b3 note 25 says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The mishnah is concerned with individuals who <strong>seek to demonstrate</strong>\n  the extent of their ability to portray Hashem's merciful kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your translation appears to be accurate and your questions would be answered to say that they are indeed showing off and trying to convince others that they have deep thoughts on the matter.

Rav Kook was the first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of 20th century pre-Israel Palestine and was a great mystic and poet. Read it bearing in mind that the emended reading for the Rambam that he proposes is in fact found in the older Yemenite manuscripts of Mishneh Torah, and was also accepted and propounded by Rav Soloveitchik, z”l.</p>\n\n<p>The Righteous Among The Nations [The Rambam wrote:] “Any [gentile] who accepts the seven Noahide commandments and is careful in their performance is one of the righteous of the nations (chasidei umot ha’olam), and he has a portion in the world-to-come. That is if he accepts them and performs them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and proclaimed through Moses that Noahides had previously been commanded in these. But if they perform them because it makes sense [to them], such a person is … not one of the ‘righteous of the nations’ nor one of their wise men” (Hilchot Melachim 8:11). [This statement of the Rambam requires emendation.] The correct reading is: “he is not [merely] one of ‘the righteous of the gentiles, ’ but one of their wise men.” I tend to think that the Rambam means to say that having a portion in the world-tocome is an inferior level (although it too is very great). Since even wicked and ignorant Jews attain it, it is-compared to [truly] spiritual levels-low. The Rambam says that intellectual awareness brings a person much closer to [understanding] the righteousness of God’s Providence. 10/8/2017 Rav Kook on Wise Gentiles and their Fate – Talis In Wonderland <a href=\"https://talisinwonderland.com/2011/04/06/rav-kook-on-holy-gentiles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://talisinwonderland.com/2011/04/06/rav-kook-on-holy-gentiles/</a> 2/4 Therefore, having a portion in the world-to-come is a level attained by the righteous of the nations who have not attained an intellectual awareness, but who have rather accepted the faith simply, with heart-felt emotion, and have acted well, as a result of having accepted the concept that the commandments were given by God. But if a person has come to understand the seven Noahide commandments as a result of his own thinking, he is truly wise of heart and lled with understanding. Such a person is considered one of their wise men, for the trait of wisdom is very great. And it is superuous to say that he has a portion in the world-to-come. [Indeed,] he stands on a holy level that needs to be spoken of with a fuller expression than “having a portion in the world-to-come.” However, even were we to accept the Rambam’s words simply [without emendation], we will nd nothing in them strange if we say that the quality of the world-to-come that the Rambam is speaking of is a particular state that the divine and special nature of our holy Torah gives to those who keep the Torah. But there are other states that can be transmitted by anything good-only, it is not called the “world-to-come.” That special [state called the “world-to-come”] derives from the power of the Torah, and is appropriate for anyone who accepts it and the sanctity of its faith. But this does not in any way deny other qualities that can be imagined regarding every philosophy, each in its own way. Igrot Hara’yah This passage says that the spiritual level conveyed automatically to Jews (and non-Jews) with simple faith in the Torah, “the world to come”, is a lower level than that attained by truly wise gentiles. This reading of Rambam is exactly the opposite of the reading accepted by many pre-modern (and some modern) Ashkenazi Rabbis, who read the Rambam as saying that wise gentiles do not have a portion in “the world to come” since they were not on as high a level as a simple Jew or a gentile with faith in the Torah. R’ Kook’s comment that various attainments result from the various philosophies of the world, and higher attainments can be imagined for those reach knowledge of God’s will based on their own wisdom, is intriguing</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Aren't wigs counterproductive?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I know, married women have to cover their head for tzniut (modesty). A common way to do this is by wearing a wig. But sometimes the wig looks even prettier than the women's hair. Wouldn't this be more provocative?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Other answers have done well to reference the letter and the spirit of the law. A wig, even a beautiful one, covers both bases.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in Kesubos 72a-b lays out the obligation of a married Israelite woman covering her hair as two-fold: Biblical (<em>deoraysa</em>), and as a matter of Jewish practice (<em>das yehudis</em>). This is a harmonization of two Tannatic sources, namely the Mishna in Ketubos under discussion , in which it is purely a matter of Jewish practice, and Tanna deVei Rabbi Yishmael, where the implication is that it is Biblical.</p>\n\n<p>For matters Biblical, one does not, as a practical matter of <strong>applying</strong> the law, deduce reasons. One does not look to the spirit of the law, but applies the letter of the law. This is the dispute of whether <em>darshinan taama dekra</em> (whether we deduce the purpose of the law), where the halachic conclusion is that we do not. I've heard explanations for this, including that one's suggested or understood reason might well not be the correct, or the only, reason for the Biblical law.</p>\n\n<p>Within that gemara in Kesubos, the Biblical obligations are less than the 'Jewish practice' obligations. Thus, a <em>kalta</em> (Rashi: a sort of basket-hat), while sufficient Biblically in certain locations, does not fulfill the 'Jewish practice' obligation.</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that, rather than 'Jewish practice' being a matter of increased <em>chumra</em> (stringency), this instead means that a <em>kalta</em> would fulfill the strict letter of the law. Her hair is, after all, covered, and so she has fulfilled the Biblical mandate. However, as a matter of common propriety, of the common practice of Jewish women covering their hair, a <em>kalta</em> did not suffice. This could be read as a matter of fulfilling the spirit of the law, whatever we define that \"spirit\" as.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, the wig is considered, in certain religious communities, as the common practice for Jewish women covering their hair. I would say that it is <em>das yehudis</em>. Further, <em>das yehudis</em>, not being Biblical and objective, shifts with time, place, and community, along with other subjective aspects of <em>tznius</em>. (For example, whether one must cover her feet is halachically a subjective matter, which halachically depends on one's community.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll add three points in closing.</p>\n\n<p>1) The Bavli discusses <em>kalta</em> (the basket-hat), with a statement by Rabbi Yochanan. אמר רבי אסי אמר ר' יוחנן קלתה אין בה משום פרוע ראש. Rabbi Assi cited Rabbi Yochanan: A kalta lacks any problem of uncovered head. The Bavli then distinguishes between Biblical and Das Yehudis, between private domain, courtyard, alleyway, and marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi(Yerushalmi Kesubos 42b) has a parallel statement, and distinguishes between locale, but never makes the harmonization between Mishna and Tana deVei Rabbi Yishmael to bring in a Biblical aspect. But that Yerushalmi has a statement by Rabbi Yochanan:\nרבי חייה בשם רבי יוחנן היוצאה בקפלטין שלה אין בה משום ראשה פרוע\nRabbi Chiya citing Rabbi Yochanan said: One [a woman] who goes out with her <em>kapilitin</em>, there is not in it an issue of uncovered head.</p>\n\n<p>The word <em>kapilitin</em> is actually Latin. It is a cappilitium, which is a wig.</p>\n\n<p>So a wig is placed in the same approximate place as a Babylonian <em>kalta</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I would say that a similar sentiment as those who, throughout the ages, have wanted to ban wigs, is motivating Rabbi Yochanan's statement. Despite \"looking like her hair\", besides being hair, besides \"making her look more attractive\", it fulfills the obligation. </p>\n\n<p>And this furthermore places the wig explicitly within the realm of <em>das Yehudis</em>, which I would say is subjective and dependent upon common Jewish women's practice.</p>\n\n<p>2) The spirit of the law, that is, the motivating principle, is not necessarily what some people assume. It is not necessarily that hair is so beautiful and provocative that it is akin to, and must be treated as nakedness and pornographic (erva). And that fake hair, if beautiful and attractive, is more so, and would have the same status.</p>\n\n<p>I had a discussion online with someone who made a statement along these lines, of assuming reasons and therefore application: \"of course, no one would say that a woman could put her own hair on her head as a wig. So why would you say that she could take another woman's hair and put it on her head.\" I pointed out that the Mishna Brurah explicitly says that a woman can use her own disconnected hair as a wig. (And there are associated reasons why it is different than her connected hair.) My point: don't assume your own reason as an absolute known entity.</p>\n\n<p>3) Throughout generations (rishonim, acharonim, I would say even possibly Amoraim), there have been disputes as to the status of the wig, with some arguing that X defeats the purpose and others arguing that it is fine. That is, this is not a new dispute and a newly discovered argument. I am writing this because some try to argue that <strong>innovations</strong> in sheitel making makes modern wigs a different animal than the wigs of prior generations. However, this is not the case. Back when Rav Moshe Feinstein permitted wigs (see Igros Moshe, Even haEzer chelek 2, siman 12), he explicitly addressed (as a matter of maris ayin) a wig which is indistinguishable from a woman's natural hair, where it seems she is not wearing a wig. And Rav Shalom Shwadron, in 1972 or earlier, complained of realistic looking wigs, such that the woman didn't look married. This is not exactly the same argument as \"looks prettier\", but that is just the latest spin to try to make this in to a new issue, different than the ones discussed by Rabbis through the ages.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A lot of people would agree with you and say that a wig is less modest since it makes a lot of women look prettier.</p>\n\n<p>But to understand the other side, one of the ideas behind wearing a wig is that it does cover the woman's real hair which has some spirituality to it that a wig does not have, since the wig is not the women's actual hair. A wig actually does a better job of covering all of the woman's real hair than other forms of head-covering which is why in certain circles women only wear wigs.</p>\n\n<p>Also, according to the exact letter of the law, all you have to do is cover your hair and it doesn't matter with what. Therefore a wig is fine, whether or not wearing a wig goes against the \"spirit\" of the law.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems to me that much of the idea of tznius is from the perspective of the women, and it is a mistake to think of tznius as protecting men from improper thoughts. Therefore, the primary reason for covering hair is that a women should not display her own hair in public, keeping her beauty for her husband. A wig will answer for this, even if it is prettier than her hair.</p>\n\n<p>There is also clearly a more general consideration of not acting in a way which increase the risk of prohibited affairs. A pretty wig obviously goes against this, but there is also no specific rules here, and hair coverings are not, to my understanding, directly related to this issue.</p>\n\n<p>(I could not find any sources for this idea.)</p>\n\n\n",

He quotes someone (\"Yitzchaki\" - it is a matter of speculation of who that could refer to, although we know from other references it was someone from Spain) who says that these verses (the whole list of kings, presumably) were written in the times of Yehoshafat and says that his book should be burned for the suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra himself acknowledges the opinion that this verse was written prophetically, but prefers the explanation that it refers to rulers before Moshe - who was himself described as a king.

Some do not comment on this, and those who do say emphatically that it was either referring to a very early period (i.e. before Moshe), and/or that it was written \"Bederech Nevuah\".

Judge for yourself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כבר הראב״ע בפירושו לתחילת ספר דברים רומז לקושי שטמון בפסוק זה — כיצד אפשר לדבר על המלוכה בישראל מאות שנים לפני משיחתו של מלך ישראל הראשון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Hoffman goes on to dismantle potential biblical criticism that relates to this section. (As does Shadal, as well as other Mefarshim, see the link above.)</p>\n\n<p>If it was indeed his intention to imply this about Ibn Ezra, it is simply wrong, as Ibn Ezra does not mention this section in Devarim, in addition to the fact that almost all of the reasons/interpretations for/of the \"Sod Hashenim Asar\" would not apply to this section due to a suggestion of very late authorship, the large number of verses, and his own arguing against this very point.</p>\n\n\n",

Should the couple still pay the original shadchan the shadchan's fee?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In 1980 I published an article in the Baltimore Jewish Times called, \"What the Matchmaker Did and Didn't Do for Me.\"  I interviewed many matchmakers and their clients and made myself (then single, of course) a guinea pig for a Boro Park matchmaker.  The matchmakers make it pretty clear, that they take the time to find someone who is appropriate for you, and then, if there is an engagement, he/she gets paid on the engagement.  Back then the fee was $1,000 to $5,000.  I have no idea what it is now.  My matchmaker also stipulated that I could only go on three dates -- if we don't feel the spark after three dates, then it's over -- move on to someone else -- \"I'm not in the business of making you friends,\" she said.  It was clear also that if I make an engagement that doesn't make it to the chuppah, too bad -- no refunds; she did her job, and may have even had expenses (some matchmakers work internationally, finding matches between couples in different countries).  Since then I've become an attorney.</p>\n\n<p>A bit on the law:  In both American common law and Jewish halacha, a contract consists of an offer and acceptance, a meeting of the minds, and consideration of some sort before a contract can be deemed to be effective, although there are exceptions to the rule.  In Jewish law and American law, \"consideration\" is made by such things as a down payment, acceptance of loan money, or even the acceptance of a key to an apartment you just agreed to let.  The same is true in Jewish law, where also a <em>kinyan</em> can be effected through formalities such as the performance of an act representing the receipt of the subject matter of the transaction by the purchaser, donee, hirer, or borrower; See Baba Metzia 99a.)  An example of the latter may be that when you complete the \"sale\" of your chametz through the rabbi, the ceremonial holding by both parties of a pen or handkerchief, for example, completes the kinyan.  </p>\n\n<p>Let's assume that these same conditions I received were given to you, and lets assume that unlike my matchmaker, you actually had a written contract (this makes it easier for analysis in American and Jewish law), and paid a $100 consideration for expenses.  Since you have consideration, you have an effective kinyan and a contract is made.  So if there is no dispute about the terms, and the matchmaker introduced you to your bride, as required, then payment is due on the announcement of the engagement.  </p>\n\n<p>There is also a body of Jewish law that applies customary practices to the laws of payment to a shadchan. </p>\n\n<p>Like any worker who provides customers with a service, a shadchan must be paid for his work, which consists of arranging shidduchim. A shadchan is similar to the various types of brokers who earn fees for bringing together two sides in a transaction. See Rama, Choshen Mishpat 87:39 and 185:10.</p>\n\n<p>A shadchan whose work is solicited by the family is like any hired worker, whose payment is in accords with whatever contract or agreement they parties had.  See Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 332 and elsewhere. One who volunteers to be a shadchan for a particular person, or makes an unsolicited suggestion for a shiddach, at best is entitled only to the value of the service, which may vary. See Ibid and Ponim Me’iros vol II #63 [regarding a shidduch in which the chosson and kallah lived in different cities, which had different customs regarding how much a shadchan was paid], cited in Pischei Teshuvah ibid.; Pischei Choshen, Sechirus 14:1 [see there for a number of additional sources]. \nThus, while a shadchan must be paid whether or not his services were solicited,4 the nature of his involvement impacts several common questions, as will be discussed below.</p>\n\n<p>Whether the shadchan’s fee is due upon the couple’s engagement or only after their marriage is dependent on the terms of any agreement between the shadchan and the family, or the prevalent custom in the place that his service is provided. Where no custom exists, the payment may be delayed until after the wedding. It appears that the custom today in most places (if not all) is to pay the shadchan after the engagement. Rama, Choshen Mishpat 185:10.</p>\n\n<p>Despite your circumstances, the Shadchen did what he was contracted to do.  Like any hired worker, the Torah requires that shadchan be paid for his work on time. See Vayikra 19:13 and Devorim 24:15; Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 339.17.  If the shadchan merely volunteered his services, then, depending upon the custom of the community, he or she should be paid for the value of the service pursuant to local custom -- not his actual work.  Since he is not technically a worker, in that case, there is no specific time payment is required.  Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv zt”l ibid.; Halichos Yisroel #2; Lehoros Nosson ibid.; see Pischei Choshen ibid.</p>\n\n<p>Where the custom is that a shadchan is paid on engagement, then whether or not the wedding is later called off, he is still entitled to payment.  Taz, Choshen Mishpat 185:26; Bais Shmuel, Even Ha’ezer 50:23; see Rama ibid.  As my shadchan told me, she \"wasn't in the business\" of making me friends; if after three dates, I didn't see marriage as a sure thing, I should move on.  However, I looked into it and found that in some communities, the custom is to pay the shadchan at the time of chuppah.  I wonder what rights the shadchan has if the couple decide to go \"modern\" and just live together until they're both sure  they want to be married?  (Yes, I know, it would be a scandal.)  For other issues involving payment for services by shadchanim, see <a href=\"http://www.yated.com/paying-the-shadchan-who-when-and-how-much.0-1384-0-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Paying the Shadchan: Who, When, and How Much?\"</a>, Yeted Ne'eman, Dec. 24, 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Under American law, even if there was no written contract, going to a person who is in the business of arranging marriages, and asking him or her to look for someone is a commitment to a contract.  If the shadchan finds someone appropriate, you are obligated to pay for the service.  The classic law school case of an implied contract such as this, is sitting in a barber's chair; you can't expect the barber not to cut your hair then for free even though you did not negotiate a contract to do so.  The fundamental here is simple.  Normally, contract law requires formal offer and acceptance and a meeting of the minds.  But if it can be shown that a party voluntarily accepts and avails himself of valuable services rendered for his benefit, when he has the option whether to accept or reject them, even if there is no distinct proof that they were rendered by his authority or request, a promise to pay for them may be inferred.  Abbot v. Hermon, 7 Me 118 (1830), cited in Fuller and Eisenberg, Basic Contract Law, 4th Ed., p. 472 (West 1981). </p>\n\n<p>As far as your case:  Did anyone in your family contract with the shadchan?  If so, is there any doubt that the shadchan found you a wife?  Was there any deadline or time limit agreed to in the contract?  If the answer to each of these questions is \"no\" it appears you are liable to the shadchan for the fee that was agreed upon.  The shadchan has a business and devoted part of his business hours looking for your bride. Yet he was incentivized to look out for you because your family's promise of payment upon engagement or chuppah.  He took the risk that he'd guess wrongly about the girl for you.  You took the risk that if he found your bride you owed him money.  Furthermore, if the money was really an issue, you could have said no to the engagement, wish the girl well and move on.  So there wasn't much risk for you, as long as the shadchan didn't find the girl meant just for you.  If he did, no matter what you will pay, it was a bargain. </p>\n\n<p>So, in closing, mazel tov on your engagement.  My blessing to you is that you should have a very good paranasah (earnings from a job or business), enough so that you can pay yeshiva tuition for many children, pay off the shadchan, and build a bayit nee'man.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Even if two people stopped getting to know each other for a time but then ended up getting married it seems like the shadchan was still instrumental in introducing them to each other. Aside from knowing our partners are predestined, from the vantage point that we have it would appear that perhaps you wouldn't have met at all if it wasn't for the shadchan and paying the shadchan is based on the perceived involvement that they are part of to begin with otherwise no one would be payed for this job ever. Alternately, you could also say that perhaps you wouldn't have met as quickly if it wasn't for the introduction made by the shadchan.</p>\n\n\n",

[Thus, the blue string reminds those involved in the community's mundane needs that they have spiritual obligations too; and the white string reminds the spiritual leaders that they have obligations in this world.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No, there is nothing inherently wrong with hitbodedut.</p>\n\n<p>Hitbodedut (התבודדות) is a particular type of meditation which is part of the path of learning prophecy. It comes from the root of 'badad' (בדד) which is to be alone or solitary. This type of meditation is closely associated with the idea that the Avot, Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov tended their flocks in relative isolation. David HaMelech too, when he was young, was involved in the same type of activity. It is also in keeping with the same practice outlined in Sefer Mesillat Yesharim. One of the classics discussing this subject at length is by Rabbeinu Avraham ben HaRambam called \"HaMaspik l'Ovdei HaShem\". The final chapter of what remains of this text is called \"Perek al HaHitbodedut\" and deals with this subject exclusively.</p>\n\n<p>The primary occupation during this part of the activity is making yichudim, which are a special type of kavannah. It is not considered \"bitul Torah\" and is actually a more complete way of praying or performing any of the mitzvot together with their blessings. The expression often quoted from the Sages about this is that 'prayer without kavannah is like a body without a soul.'</p>\n\n<p>Another part of this 'hitbodedut' can also involve a personal kind of spiritual accounting, called 'cheshbon hanefesh'. This is often described as what a diligent person does when trying to improve upon their activities. It is often compared to good business practice, like reviewing where one profits, where one has deficiencies and experiences losses and how to maximize the return on ones investment. It is a very small part of the process of hitbodedut and should never leave one feeling sad. This is because the conclusion of this part of hitbodedut is in knowing that HaShem is absolutely forgiving and will help all who truly reach out for assistance.</p>\n\n<p>There are some teachings that discuss the idea of reflecting upon what one sees as the influence of their 'yetzer hara' in order to overcome it. Depending upon the individual, that can result in deleterious effects. That is why, for that specific type of activity, it is often recommended to have a 'mashpiah' or spiritual mentor who can help an individual to stay on a good path. The \"Yetzer HaRah\" can bring one to have doubts, or sadness or simply to be distracted. It has been compared to the idea of someone coming up and talking to you while you are in the middle of saying the Amidah prayer. The best course of action is often to ignore it and stay focused on the task at hand. For specifics on this subject, see Tanya, Section 1, Chapters 28 and 29.</p>\n\n<p>Like with anything in the Torah, it is a \"Tree of Life\" to those who take hold of it. Hitbodedut is a part of that tree.</p>\n\n<p>There are countless seforim which deal with the subject of hitbodedut in Hebrew along with all kabbalistic siddurim. If you are looking for a couple of excellent English sources on the subject, the three books by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan are a good place to start.</p>\n\n<p>1) Meditation and the Bible,</p>\n\n<p>2) Meditation and Kabbalah, and</p>\n\n<p>3) Jewish Meditation</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does one avoid mysticism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone is a strict Rationalist, and does not believe in many forms of Jewish mysticism, how does one go about avoiding it? I ask because kabbalistic mysticism has infiltrated many halakhoth and practices without a clear distinction of what's going on.</p>\n\n<p>An example would be Qiddush. Originally Qiddush began with \"וַיְכֻלּוּ\" but due to kabbalistic ideas of word numerology, the words \"יוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁי\" were added. Because there are halakhoth that say you can't say a partial verse, certain Rabbis/Communities also added \"וַיְהִי עֶרֶב וַיְהִי בֹקֶר \" to make it so that you are saying a complete verse. So when you open up a siddur, there are many variations of Qiddush, but none of them retain the original begining with וַיְכֻלּוּ, they also make no mention of why the additions are there, or their history.</p>\n\n<p>So when mysticism that one may severely disagree with has embedded itself so deeply in the tradition that one can't just open a siddur or a book and distinguish it, how does one go about building a life free of mysticism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Study a <em>halacha</em> book. Check its sources, and look them up. Check their sources and look them up. Check their sources and look them up. Etc. You'll have an original source for every (or almost every) aspect of <em>halacha</em>. Study those original sources and all their descendants, and you'll be able to see which aspects of <em>halacha</em> come from <em>kabala</em>. (I've no source for saying this is a good method, but it seems like one to me.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Caveat lector: I recommend this only as an exercise in <em>talmud Tora</em> and not as an exercise in (as you say) \"building a life free of mysticism\". As we see from the huge (albeit partial) <a href=\"/a/3833\">list of <em>halacha</em> authorities who have incorporated mysticism in their <em>halacha</em> works</a>, one shouldn't build a life free of mysticism.

He asks:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Since we say that required prayer (תפילת חובה) corresponds to bringing the <em>tamid</em> offering (קרבן תמיד), and the latter must come from <em>all</em> Israel, how could it be that a <em>minyan</em> that does not include all of Israel bring such an offering?</li>\n<li>Even stronger than question 1: how could an individual bring a communal offering?</li>\n<li>How could it be that each minyan brings a <em>tamid</em>, when we only need one <em>tamid</em> for all Israel?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To put it simply, he explains that all the prayers of all <em>minyanim</em> and all obligatory prayers of individuals combine into one <em>tamid</em> for all of Israel.

When they arrived, the land was divided for the 12 tribes. This would suggest that they didn't intermarry when they were slaves in Egypt, when they were in the desert and when they lived in the Land of Israel. Maybe I'm wrong, and what determined your Tribe was your father's/mother's tribe.</p>\n\n<p>Were inter-tribe marriages allowed?

A child of two people was a member of his father's tribe. The inheritance at the entry into the land was based on the entrant's tribe (and from his father).

Thus, the land which should have stayed in the mother's tribe, is now owned by the father's tribe. This applied only to the generation that entered Eretz Yisrael. The halacha was cancelled on the 15th of Av the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>Note that a woman who had brothers was allowed to marry out of the tribe because she would not inherit land from her father. Similarly, a female Levite or the daughter of a Kohen did not have any land to inherit.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad.org explains that on the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/717167/jewish/Why-Do-We-Celebrate-the-15th-of-Av.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">15th of Av</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The tribes of Israel were permitted to intermarry.

A woman who had inherited tribal lands from her\n  father was forbidden to marry out of her tribe, lest her\n  children—members of their father’s tribe—cause the transfer of land\n  from one tribe to another by inheriting her estate (as recounted in\n  Numbers 36). This ordinance was binding on the generation that\n  conquered and settled the Holy Land; when the restriction was lifted,\n  on the 15th of Av, the event was considered a cause for celebration\n  and festivity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He answers at the bottom of <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2015_06_01_archive.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To quote him</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> I heard that it is permissible to cheat, since it isn't \"Genevat Da'at\" (deception), as the teachers know that cheating occurs, and it would be \"a decree that the community cannot live up to [and which therefore is not binding].\"  Furthermore, in our institution, there's serious competition among the students to be accepted into a particular program, for which math, English, and Talmud are the main subjects, and the students are accepted based on their relative ranking of grades.  Since there's rampant cheating in all of the subjects, I am asking if I too may cheat, since it is likely that otherwise I'll be harmed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> G-d forbid that it is permissible to cheat on tests and the like!  It is \"Genevat Da'at\" (Rambam, Hilchot Deot 2:6), which is a Torah prohibition according to most authorities (Smag, Negative Mitzvah #155), and is included in the prohibition of \"Do not steal.\"  This is because \"mind-stealing\" (i.e. deception) is considered stealing, as it says [when Lavan accused Ya'akov], \"You stole my mind\" (Bereshit 31:26), and \"Avshalom stole the mind of the people of Israel\" (Shmuel 2 15:6).  </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is possible that one is also violating \"Stay far from a matter of lying,\" which is a much broader prohibition than \"Do not lie,\" as it also includes indirect lying, various strategies, and even indirectly causing a misunderstanding by one's silence -- as we see from all the examples in the Talmud (Shevuot 30-31).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, even without any verse, it is clear that cheating shows a lack of integrity. For a person to study Torah, he must first have integrity -- an ethical character trait that is both elementary and general.  Only on its foundation can one build the holiness of Torah.  The claim that \"teachers know students cheat\" does not make it permissible, just as the police's knowledge that there are thieves does not validate theft. In fact, it is the opposite -- the police force uses this knowledge to prevent theft. Similarly, a teacher's knowledge of cheating does not signify approval, but rather the opposite.  The proof is that if a teacher discovers a student cheating, he will punish him.</p>\n\n<p>The claim that the prohibition of cheating is \"not a decree the community can live up to\" also does not apply, because this is not a new decree, but an old decree of the Creator who commanded us to have integrity.  Thank G-d, many students do not cheat.  As for the concern that you will be at a disadvantage if you do not cheat, this is also not grounds for permission.  Many times people of integrity suffer the consequences of their honesty, but \"It is better for me to be called a fool all my life than to become evil in front of G-d even for a moment\" (Mishnah, Eduyot 5:6). Other people's stealing does not permit you to steal. In the end, the truth will win out and people of truth will be the leaders of the world.</p>\n\n\n",

However Rambam and others say it's musk.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>myrrh\n    (Raavad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3; Ramban; Bachya; Septuagint). Mor in Hebrew. Myrrh is a gum resin produced by trees and shrubs of the family Burseracea, most notably Commiphora myrrha, Commiphora abysinica, and Commiphora schimperi. The resin is obtained from Arabia and adjacent Africa, and is taken from the small, prickly gray-barked trees. Pearls of myrrh are brown, red or yellow, with an oily texture, becoming hard and brittle with age. It has a pleasing fragrance, very much like balsam, and a lasting, bitter, aromatic taste, hence the name mor, which signifies bitterness.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to many authorities, however, the mur here is not myrrh but musk (Saadia; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3; Abarbanel; cf. Radak, Sherashim; Ibn Janach). This is an extract taken from the musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) which lives in Nepal and Tibet (see Ibn Ezra).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I recall correctly, Malbim says it's also an animal product -- I believe a non-kosher one.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav was clearly using \"mor\" as the translation for an animal-derived fragrance. His point is that you can't say any of the plant-fragrance blessings on it (e.g. <em>borei isvei vesamim</em>), so you say <em>borei minei vesamim</em> -- \"all kinds of fragrances\" -- which functions as the <em>shehakol</em> of fragrances, the broad catch-all.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to havdala, Sefardic practice is simple enough -- you make whatever blessing is appropriate for the fragrance you have. <em>Hanoten re'ah tov baPerot</em> for freshly-ground coffee; <em>borei atzei vesamim</em> for roses; and so on. Ashkenazic practice at some point became -- \"eh we're afraid people will get confused and not make the right bracha, so just make a <em>minei</em> on everything so you're always safe.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav is then saying if you want to do it extra-right, have some musk on the table so that you're not just respecting Ashkenazic practice of saying <em>minei vesamim</em>, you're actually saying the most-specific bracha for this fragrance!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The word םור is commonly translated as \"myrrh\" based on numerous English translations that I have seen such as in Birnbaum & Art Scroll Siddur as wellas Stone Chumash. (I haven't seen another translation.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrrh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> describes this as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Myrrh /ˈmɜr/ from the Hebrew '\"מור\"' (\"mor\") and Arabic مر (mur) is\n  the aromatic resin of a number of small, thorny tree species of the\n  genus Commiphora,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrrh\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> which is an essential oil termed an oleoresin.\n  Myrrh resin is a natural gum. It has been used throughout history as a\n  perfume, incense and medicine. It can also be ingested by mixing it\n  with wine.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is from a plant, not an animal. A Google search revealed that myrrh is widely available in various forms, esp. as an essential oil.</p>\n\n<p>Translating the Siddur Harav:</p>\n\n<p>\"Anything that is neither a type of grass or tree such as \"mor\" which is musk (sorry, I can't translate the parenthetical part), which comes from the hump (nape) of the neck of an animal, it is known that (this sunstance) gathers there (at the neck) first as a from of blood, and then it dries and the \"mor\" comes from it. You make the blessing <em>Borei Minei Besamim</em>. But one is forbidden to eat this or put it in cooking, because there is a possibility that this may be considered blood. There are some that permit it, but it is better to be strict because of a possibility of violating a Biblical prohibition.\"</p>\n\n<p>Curious, myself, I looked up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Wikipedia article</a> about musk which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Musk is a class of aromatic substances commonly used as base notes in\n  perfumery. They include glandular secretions from animals such as the\n  musk deer, numerous plants emitting similar fragrances, and artificial\n  substances with similar odors.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> Musk was a name originally given\n  to a substance with a penetrating odor obtained from a gland of the\n  male musk deer. The substance has been used as a popular perfume\n  fixative since ancient times and is one of the more expensive animal products > in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Wikipedia article states that musk could come from either the musk deer, which is a kosher animal, or the musk rat (aka muskrat) which is a non-kosher animal. </p>\n\n<p>Well, in terms of obtaining this \"mor\", it depends on which translation you wish to follow. Both myrrh and musk are available quite easily.</p>\n\n\n",

They said, (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232/jewish/Chapter-37.htm#showrashi=true&v=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 37:20</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַתָּה | לְכוּ וְנַהַרְגֵהוּ וְנַשְׁלִכֵהוּ בְּאַחַד הַבֹּרוֹת וְאָמַרְנוּ חַיָּה רָעָה אֲכָלָתְהוּ וְנִרְאֶה מַה יִּהְיוּ חֲלֹמֹתָיו:‏</p>\n<p>So now, let us kill him, and we will cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'A wild beast devoured him,' and we will see what will become of his dreams.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ונראה מה יהיו חלומותיו:</strong> אמר ר' יצחק מקרא זה אומר דרשני, רוח הקודש אומרת כן. הם אומרים נהרגהו, והכתוב מסיים ונראה מה יהיו חלומותיו, נראה דבר מי יקום או שלכם או שלי. ואי אפשר שיאמרו הם ונראה מה יהיו חלומותיו מכיון שיהרגוהו בטלו חלומותיו:‏</p>\n<p><strong>and we will see what will become of his dreams:</strong> Rabbi Isaac said, This verse says: “Expound on me.” [I.e., this verse demands a midrashic interpretation.] The Holy Spirit says thus: They (the brothers) say, “Let us kill him,” but the verse concludes: “and we will see what will become of his dreams.” Let us see whose word will stand up, yours or Mine. It is impossible that they (the brothers) are saying,“and we will see what will become of his dreams,” because, since they will kill him, his dreams will come to nought. [From Tan. Buber, Vayeshev 13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>Text and translations from Chabad.org</sup></p>\n<p>I have trouble with Rav Yitzhak's general assumption, here. Why couldn't the brothers have been the one's making that statement? It would just be stating the result of their actions. It's as if the brothers said, \"Joseph dreamt that he would rule over us. So, if we kill him, we'll see what happens to all those dreams he had. Nothing will become of them, because he won't rule over us.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The rhetorical usage of \"Oh yeah, we'll see what will be with that\" is modern, but the proper usage of ונראה is the future tense, waiting to see what will happen as a result of their actions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>What is odd about this <em>pasuk</em> is the sequence of tenses.  Normally, once we start with a consecutive <em>vav</em> construction (ואמרנו), and the subject stays the same (ie. the sentence is unmarked: there's no contrast involved, or there's not quotation), we continue using consecutive <em>vav</em>.  The major exception is when a word intervenes in the clause before the verb, whereupon we switch to imperfect.  See <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/112._The_Perfect_with_W%C4%81w_Consecutive\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gesenius 112</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0134.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen 34:16</a>, there are four verbs, three of which use consecutive <em>vav</em> (ונתנו, וישבנו, והיינו), and the only reason the fourth (נקח) is in imperfect is that there are words in its clause that precede it (ואת בנתיכם).</p>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0137.htm#30\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen 37:30</a>, it seems that we have the same subject for both ואמרנו and נראה, but נראה is imperfect seemingly without reason.  Thus, Rabbi Isaac sees something unusual in this <em>pasuk</em> that calls out to be expounded.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>What you are suggesting is actually the <em>peshuto shel mikrah</em> (the literal level) whereas Rabbi Yitzchak cited by Rashi is saying a <em>derash</em> (double-meaning; as he says explicitly \"דרשני\"), akin to e.g. where in Esther \"the king\" on the <em>pshat</em> level, simultaneously refers to \"the King\" (i.e. G-d) on the <em>drash</em> level. Perhaps the <em>medrash</em> is suggesting that the Author is drawing attention to the idea that \"א מאן טראכט און גאט לאכט\" (lit: A man thinks and G-d laughs). They were trying to sabotage his dreams from ever being fulfilled, denying his divine mission. They expressed it in a (mocking) way that said literally \"we will see\" which, if they were right, would be meaningless in the literal sense. Thus, on a Rabbinic hermeneutic level, he simultaneously <em>darshans</em> it literally as indeed they will see.</p>\n\n\n",

He said that he had nothing to add to the response of the Rebbe Rashab, Rabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn, on the question.</p>\n\n<p>The Rashab was asked specifically about the Radziner techelet which was from the cuttlefish. The Rashab said that as much as he wanted to be able to say the Radziner techelet was legitimate, he could not after reading everything the Radziner Rebbe had provided him about it.

He basically mentioned the opposition to it by the gedolei hador who did not agree to this chiddush by the Radziner Rebbe and basically defers to the opinion of the Rashab.</p>\n<p><strong>Can techelet be revealed in our times?</strong></p>\n<p>The Rashab in that letter mentioned by the Lubavitcher Rebber elaborated on some kabbalistic considerations based on the Alter Rebbe and the Arizal. The Arizal mentioned that there was no techelet in his time as there was no Temple, but this statement of the Arizal cannot mean that we can't have techelet if there is no Temple as the Rebbe Rashab himself stated and we will see below.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe also clarified this point, which is mentioned in the letter of the Rashab, by explaining that techelet is mochin d'Abba in Likkutei Torah, Sh'lach 12.8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולפי שתכלת מוחין דאבא ולבן מוחין דאימא לכן בזה הזמן אין תכלת לפי\nשלגודל מעלתו שהוא מבחי׳ אבא א״א לירד בזמן הגלות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This level of techelet is not able to descend from our mitzvot-related actions, but Hashem brings it down in other ways as mentioned in Birkeiy Yosef 8/4 in name of the Kabbalist Yaakov Tzemach and explicitly stated in the Arizal.</p>\n<p>Techelet is the level of Mochin d’Abba, but this level is not completely closed off to be drawn down as seen in Likkutei Torah Tzav 6, Vayikra 2, Shmini Atzeret 3 et al. where it says that at specific periods of the year (Shabbat, Pesach, Simchat Torah) mochin d’Abba is drawn down. See the Arizal himself in Pri Etz Chaim, Shaar Pesach, and Tefillin regarding certain items that exist today that are also Mochin d’Abba like Rabbeinu Tam tefillin (and it is drawn down from levels even higher than mochin d'abba in case of the Tefillin of Shimusha Rabba and Raavad that some people wear), chametz, matza, or the last 2 cups of wine during the seder among others. <strong>Hence, we can see there are items that we use in our avodah from the level of mochin d'Abba that exist today despite the fact that galut may tamper with their spiritual accomplishments.</strong></p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe and Arizal actually meant that the techelet of the time of the Mishna and Talmud after the chorban could not achieve that \"drawing down\" of spiritual energy due to the galut that took place after the destruction of the First Temple according to the Rebbe Rashab. Hence, the Arizal and the Alter Rebbe simply cannot mean that techelet cannot exist if there is no Temple or the Jewish people are in galut, because techelet existed when there was no Temple and the Jewish people during the whole second Temple period and afterwards including the Tannaim and Amoraim wore it precisely all the way until the Geonic of the period when Techelet was completely lost.</p>\n<p>The Rashab himself in that letter after discussing these topics said that all these kabbalistic issues do not void the mitzvah of techelet since:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומ”מ גם זאת א”א לומר דמשום זה יפטר ממצות תכלת, דודאי המצוה היא מצוה תמידית וכשיש ביכולתינו לקיימה נראה שאנו צריכים לקיימה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Nevertheless, it is impossible to argue that one is exempt from the mitzvah of tekhelet for this reason, for the mitzvah is certainly eternal. When we are able to fulfill it, we are obligated to do so.\"</strong></p>\n<p>This is despite the fact that after the destruction of the Temple wearing techelet is not necessarily kabbalistically to draw down certain spiritual levels. This level is drawn down anyway but not through our avoda, but <strong>according to the revealed aspect of Torah the mitzvah remains valid as it is an eternal mitzvah, and we need to fulfil it whenever is possible</strong>.</p>\n<p>For a deeper discussion of the opinion of the Rashab see the\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14qvPeAfTZByPCqqIZj92K_2Ri6XxYA9d/view?usp=share_link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ביאור שיטת רבותינו בענין תכלת בזה\"ז</a> by the Chabad Shliach, Rabbi Isser Zalman Weisberg from Toronto, where more points are brought up.</p>\n<p><strong>Do we have to wait until Mashiach to get techelet?</strong></p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe in that letter in the 1950s did not say that wearing techelet had to wait until the times of Mashiach, but he said \"l'atid lavo\", future times but not necessarily the times of Mashiach (Cf. Kesubos 87a; Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach HaChaim, 407:1; see Torah Ohr Shemos 2:23 where the addition of לימות המשיח to the expression לעתיד לבא is meant to specify the actual moment in the future, so obviously they don’t mean the same). Therefore, <strong>the Rebbe simply indicated that according to Kabbalah the need of wearing techelet to draw down that high spiritual level was only due in the future, not in the 1950s, but possibly 30 or 40 years later.</strong></p>\n<p>Even even if this expression would only mean the <em>Messianic Era</em>, the Lubavitcher Rebbe stated many times in the 1990s that were already in the Messianic Era (Sefer HaSichos, 5752, p.173) and in Parshas Vayeishev in 1991 that the Avoda of birur the fallen sparks has been completed, and the world is now ready for Moshiach’s coming.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, one year after this declaration Ptil Techelet went public and started to sell techelet at small scale but the Rebbe had a stroke soon after that left him very limited and ultimately led to his hillula.</p>\n<p>That declaration by the Lubavitcher Rebbe is very relevant as the Rebbe Rashab in his opening letter on the Radziner Techelet linked the revelation of techelet to the completion of avodat habirurim (Likkutei Torah, Shir HaShirim, 39:9). Additionally other gedolim have stated we are in the ultimate geula and Mashiach is already here, like R Chaim Kanievky, Sar HaTorah, who in June 15, 2016 said “Mashiach is already here. He will reveal himself very soon”. This is indeed a big zechut for our generation which is the last one of galut and the first generation of the geula!</p>\n<p><strong>Should we wear techelet today? Is there any downside?</strong></p>\n<p>Now that we have rediscovered the murex trunculus which some Rishonim and Acharonim directly identify as the chilazon of the techelet, we should certainly go ahead to wear it as the Rebbe Rashab was quoted above, <em>“for certainly this mitzvah is an eternal mitzvah and when it is in our ability to fulfill it, it seems we need to fulfill it”</em>, and later the Rebbe Rashab discussed the implications of wearing techelet being a חיוב, an obligation.</p>\n<p>Wearing murex techelet is also the right course of action even if we hold it is just a safek that the techelet available today is the correct one since ספק דאוריתא לחומרה; in other words, in maters of Torah law like techelet, we are machmir to fulfill positive mitzvos even if we are not sure we will accomplish the desired outcome due to doubt of the timing or the way it is performed or both, and indeed the Rebbe Rashab stated later at the end of his letter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובפרט לפי מה שהעלה שגם אם אינו תכלת האמיתי אינו מפסיד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"This is especially so according to the conclusion that even <strong>if it is not authentic techelet, no loss is done [by attempting to fulfill the mitzvah].\"</strong></p>\n<p>Hence even if, chas v'shalom, the murex techelet would turn up to be not the one that chazal had, yet we did not loose anything or had any Halachic negative outcome or downside according to the teaching of our Rebbeim.</p>\n<p><strong>Be zoche of the mitzvah of techelet today</strong></p>\n<p>Our attitude towards any mitzvah in general, and this mitzvah of techelet in particular,  is well captivated in Likkutei Tefilot 1:49 of Reb Nosson of Breslov, where it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי גָּלוּי וְיָדוּעַ לְפָנֶיךָ שֶׁרְצוֹנֵנוּ לַעֲשׂוֹת רְצוֹנְךָ,\nוְאָנוּ חֲפֵצִים וּמִתְגַּעְגְּעִים לְקַיֵּם מִצְוַת תְּכֵלֶת\nשֶׁבַּצִּיצִית, וְאִם הָיִינוּ זוֹכִים לִמְצֹא תְּכֵלֶת לְצִיצִית\nהָיִינוּ מְפַזְּרִים הוֹן רַב כְּדֵי לְקַיֵּם הַמִּצְוָה בִּשְׁלֵמוּת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"For it is revealed and known before You that our will is to do Your will, and we eagerly yearn to fulfill the commandment of tekhelet in the tzitzit. If we were privileged to find tekhelet for the tzitzit, we would spare no expense to fulfill this commandment completely.\"</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I didn't find a reference to techelet in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/60675/jewish/Wisdom-Teachings.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">online archive of the the Lubavitcher Rebbe writings</a> but there are two references to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/530127/jewish/Techelet-Blue-Thread.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Sholom DovBer</a>, the fifth Rebbe of Lubavitch, and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/529771/jewish/Why-do-some-have-a-blue-string-in-their-tzitzit.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Arizal</a> both writing that we will only know about the chilazon (who produces techelet) when Mashiah comes.</p>\n\n<p>This must be why Chabad rabbis do not wear techelet.</p>\n\n\n",

Consequently they argued, it is our obligation to do something about it.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Are there any circumstances when one should not follow halacha when it comes into conflict with one's sense of morality? </p></li>\n<li><p>If there is something in accepted halacha that opposes one's sense of morality, is that any evidence against its status as correct halacha?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This may be a matter of semantics but, inasmuch as <em>halacha</em> is defined as what one <em>should</em> do in any given scenario, the answer to 1 is necessarily no. This isn't to say that halacha is \"one size fits all\". On the contrary, the nuances of each individual case are what define its unique ruling. (This is the prime motivation behind the AYLOR caveat prevalent on this site.)</p>\n\n<p>With regards to 2, it depends. Were the person <em>higiya l'horaah</em> (has sufficient moral and legal understanding of halacha), yet the majority of the halachic authorities (e.g. the Sanhedrin) have ruled without the benefit of his unique wisdom (which he, without any hubris or naivete, understands to be so compelling as to be beyond argument), he would be remiss to supress his unique moral knowledge, whether by his own actions or by withholding his information from the halachic authorities (see e.g. the first daf of Horayos and Rishonim including Ramban and Tosfoth HaRosh; See also Rambam, Hilchoth Mamrim Ch. 1-3). </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if his is a vaguely defined moral intuition, utterly lacking in the nuance that defines halachic reasoning, and tainted by the mores of an outside culture that condones barbarity and perverseness that are antithetical to true morality (as is suggested by the language chosen by the \"rabbi\" you cite), the issue is primarily with his hubris, naivete, and his understanding, not only of \"morality\" but perhaps of halacha as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Morality is not decided on the whim of feelings nor is absolute morality decided by changing opinions in society. What is considered moral now was different 100 years ago and will be different in another 100 years but halacha is always moral, unlike a moral opinion which doesn't recognize Torah. With the understanding that Torah comes from Hashem, who is good and does good, it wouldn't make sense to call halacha immoral.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Division of Parshiyot in Tanach – Same or Seperate Nevuah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I had a question about the Masoretic divisions in the Tanach, specifically the \"פ\" and \"ס\" notations.</p>\n<p>I know that the division into chapters was a Christian development that has been accepted for convenience in Jewish editions of the Bible. I'm guessing the Christians editors tried to separate between chapters on somewhat of a thematic basis, which is not always in agreement with a the Rabbinic interpretation.</p>\n<p>My question is how do the \"פ\" and \"ס\" notations relate to theme? Does every break denote an entirely new parsha, with the content of one separate from the other? In nevi'im, do separate parshiyot indicate different nevuot that took place at different times?</p>\n<p>For example, in Yeshayahu 43, pasuk 9 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּֽל־הַגּוֹיִ֞ם נִקְבְּצ֣וּ יַחְדָּ֗ו וְיֵאָֽסְפוּ֙ לְאֻמִּ֔ים מִ֤י בָהֶם֙ יַגִּ֣יד זֹ֔את וְרִֽאשֹׁנ֖וֹת יַשְׁמִיעֻ֑נוּ יִתְּנ֤וּ עֵֽדֵיהֶם֙ וְיִצְדָּ֔קוּ וְיִשְׁמְע֖וּ וְיֹאמְר֥וּ אֱמֶֽת׃</p>\n<p>Were all the nations gathered together, and kingdoms assembled, who of them would tell this or let us know of the first events? Let them present their witnesses, and they shall be deemed just, and let them hear and say, \"True.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas later on in pasuk 18:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַֽל־תִּזְכְּר֖וּ רִֽאשֹׁנ֑וֹת וְקַדְמֹנִיּ֖וֹת אַל־תִּתְבֹּנָֽנוּ׃</p>\n<p>Remember not the first events, and do not meditate over early ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are in two separate parshiyot. What is their relationship? Are they meant to be read in context of each other, or separately?</p>\n\n\n",

This is the whole Torah, and the rest is commentary; go and learn it.\"  - <em>Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a</em></p>\n\n<p>This is similar to the Torah where it says, \"Love your neighbour as yourself.\" - <em>Leviticus 19</em></p>\n\n<p>except that Hillel's statement is negative (not to hate), whereas the Torah's statement is positive (to love). Is there a reason why Hillel formulated the Golden Rule in this way? Furthermore, does it matter in halacha whether the Golden Rule is formulated negatively or positively? Is the positive version stronger than the negative version?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The basic story is that a goy approached Shamai and Hillel to convert if they could tell him the basic meaning of Judaism \"on one foot\". Shamai, having the impression that the goy was being sarcastic (as I interpret the gemoro) and asking for the impossible, chased him away with a \"builders measure\". That is Shammai saw that he was not sincere and chased him away with something that symbolized Hashem created the universe with mishpat. Hillel gave his famous statement (ending with \"now go and study\") which convinced the goy to actually convert properly and study.</p>\n\n<p>@CraigFeinstein pointed to <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/parsha-insights/5761/achareimos.html#\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shammai, feeling that he wasn't serious, chased him away.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Kli Yakar explains that this gentile was not mocking the Rabbis at\n  all but was, in fact, being very sincere. He, who hadn't studied Torah\n  from a young age, was looking for a single foundation upon which he\n  could base and thereby remember the entire Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point is that a general philosophical statement does not lead to proper understanding until an actual practical understanding has been reached. The way Hillel expressed it showed the goy that one needs to understand what one is doing and have a specific method of carrying it out.</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" and what practical means are there to actually carry it out? Hillel's formulation is designed to allow someone who has not studied Halacha to be able to start with concepts that he can understand and have a practical means of carrying it out without getting into meaningless philosophical arguments. One can say that many of the prohibitions of the Torah are formulated this way for similar reasons.</p>\n\n<p>We can see this by examining the history of those who say \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" and never actually create laws and procedures to carry it out properly. They acted like the modern leftists that base everything on \"feelings\" and not on actions. Note that Hillel does not speak of feelings (he does not say \"do not hate\") but instead points out a specific way of acting. That is, those things that you would find \"hateful\" or wrong if someone else does it to you should not be done to others. This allows people who live in a society to begin to understand their responsibilities rather than concentrating on the \"rights\" that other people must grant them.</p>\n\n<p>The prohibition against stealing shows the responsibility to ensure that others are \"secure in their persons and property\". On the other hand, the right to \"be secure in one's own person and property\" has not prevented people from stealing while at the same time enforcing their own rights.</p>\n\n\n",

The founder of the sect being Anan, his followers were at first called Ananites, but as\nthe doctrines of the sect were more fully developed, and it gradually\nemancipated itself from Ananism, they took the name of \"Karaites,\" a term first used by Benjamin al-Nahawendi (\"Ba'ale Miḳra\" at the end of\nhis \"Sefer Linim\") and in a quotation in \"Yefet.\"</p>\n<p>On Anan's death, between 780 and 800, his son Saul, and then his grandson Josiah, succeeded him as head of the sect, but both of them were too insignificant intellectually to leave many traces in Karaism. But between 830 and 890 men of greater mark appeared among the\nKaraites, who, while differing among themselves and creating various subdivisions in the new sect, agreed in diverging from Anan's doctrines, and even from his methods of teaching.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, they had already accepted the canon from the Anshei Kneses Hagedola which ended after the establishment of Purim (Megilas Esther) and before the Chashmonaim (book of Maccabbes).</p>\n<p>The already mentioned <a href=\"http://www.karaitejudaism.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Karaite website</a> states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>we only recognize the Miqra or Tanakh as divinely given.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They define Tanach in the same way that we do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The development of the Jewish \"canon\" predates the emergence of rabbinism/Pharisaism, let alone the development of the mishnah and talmuds.\nAlthough texts such as Ben Sirach and Maccabees are not accepted as canonical, they are important documents demonstrating the formation of Second Temple Judaism.\n2 Maccabees (ch. 2) writes a tradition that Nehemiah organized a Library and collected books on the Kings, the Prophets and the Psalms of David, in addition to other books, and that later, Judas Maccabi also tried to recover these books that had been lost in war.\nAlthough it does not indicate which books and how many, a primitive division already appears in this tradition that, added to the Torah, there are the books of the Prophets and other Writings.</p>\n<p>In Ben Sirac, there is also a primitive structure of authorized books where there are almost all the books that make up the current Tanakh/Miqrah, with the exception of Shir, Esther, Ruth and Daniel.\nHowever, this can be explained, in part, by their non-existence independently, but inserted in other sets, just as the Twelve form a single book and are not counted individually.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Flavius Josephus and 2 Esdras, texts from the first century c.e., already demonstrate the existence of an established Jewish canon composed of 22 (according to Josephus) or 24 (according to 2 Esdras) authorized books [see 2 Esdras 14].</p>\n<p>Thus, the canonicity of the Tanakh as it exists today can be traced to existing as early as the 1st century, before the Yavneh rabbinic debate. Rather than being the product of rabbinic mentality, it is the product of Jewish self-sufficiency in Eretz Israel, beginning its formation with Ezra-Nehemia, and being completed in the Hasmonean period, surviving to this day.</p>\n<p>The fact that the rabbis in the Talmud discussed the validity of certain books does not mean that they defined the canon, but rather that there was a dispute between maintaining what already existed or making changes, with the majority being supporters of maintenance.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do Karaite Jews Celebrate Chanuka?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I know, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaite_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Karaite Judaism</a> recognizes the Tanakh only as its source of Jewish Law and practice. </p>\n\n<p>However <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65792/do-karaites-celebrate-purim\">Karaites do celebrate Purim</a> based on the Book of Esther, so they do observe non-mosaic institutions that are based on written sources unaffiliated with The Oral Tradition. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Maccabees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Maccabbes</a> was written by a Jewish author and a simple reading of <a href=\"http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/1maccabees.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Mac</a> 4:59 Has the Jewish people as a whole instituting the festival of Chanukah.</p>\n\n<p>So do Karaite Jews celebrate Chanuka? If not, why not? It is based on a Jewish, plainly written source which is beyond the pale of the rabbinic canon.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Traditionally Karaites have not celebrated Hanukkah. (<a href=\"http://abluethread.com/2015/12/14/are-the-historical-karaite-jewish-objections-to-hanukkah-still-relevant-today/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sources</a>). In modern times, assimilation being what it is, there are undoubtedly some who do, but it's not on the Karaite calendar.</p>\n\n<p>The Karaites had two main objections:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Rabbis did not have the authority to establish a holiday (Purim is different, you can <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/comparing-purims/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">read about the karaite take on that here</a>).</li>\n<li>The rededication of the temple was tragically short lived - the Jews didn't keep the temple for too much longer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore, the karaites never adopted Hanukkah as a holiday.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Karaite website <a href=\"http://www.karaite-korner.org/sources/5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Hannukah: Have the Jewish People Been Celebrating a Pagan Holiday?\"</a> gives sources about the question. However, it does not give a definitive answer. The <a href=\"http://www.karaite-korner.org/holiday_dates.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karaite calendar</a> shows no holiday during the period that Chanukah would fall in 2014 as well as 2015. It does show Rosh Chodesh Teves (as 10th New Moon). This would seem to imply that they do not celebrate Chanukah.</p>\n\n<p>I checked both 2014 and 2015 to see Pesach and found that neither Purim nor Chanukah are shown on the calendar</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I did find references to Karaite celebration of <a href=\"http://www.kjuonline.com/calendars.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Purim</a>, with the dates listed at a different Karaite site, but there is no reference to Chanukah at all. The calendar includes the fasts of Tzom Gedaliah, Asara B'Teves, and several others in Tamuz and Av that are different from the ones that we have. I do not know if this is the same or different than the other calendar that I found above. This calendar includes the modern celebrations of Yom Hashoah and Yom Ha'atzmaut as well.</p>\n\n<p>It appears from the references that Karaism accepts all celebrations that existed before the complete Tanach was canonized by the Anshei Knesset Hag'dolah. This would mean that Purim (Megilas Esther) is included but Chanukah is not (since it occured <strong>after</strong> the Anshei Knesset Hag'dolah no longer existed).</p>\n\n<p>I do not know if these web sites are that of the real Karaites or the sites of modern creations.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the basis that allows Rabbis to create laws?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that the Torah gives instructions to obey Judges for legal cases and questions, but what is the basis that Rabbis have for creating new laws, such as for celebrating Chanukah with a bracha? I'm not asking for the basis for Chanukah specifically, but rather the general authority to create laws rather than just applying them.</p>\n\n<p>I ask because I was not aware of the Torah explicitly saying this, and it might seem somewhat circular for the Rabbis to give themselves the authority. Yet the people seem to have traditionally accepted such practices, so here I am.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I would be willing to accept an answer such as the authority being in the Oral Law or through rules of drush the Rabbis have to explain the Oral Law, or similar, if that is all there is to it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><strong>Sources For Rabbinic Authority</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are several divergent approaches to this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/0000.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to MT</a>: 26) is of the opinion  that Rabbinic legislation falls under the rubric of \"Do not stray from all that they tell you\" (Deut. 17:11):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן יתבאר מהם המנהגות והתקנות שהתקינו או שנהגו בכל דור ודור, כמו שראו בית דין של אותו הדור, לפי שאסור לסור מהם, שנאמר \"לא תסור, מכל הדבר אשר יגידו לך--ימין ושמאל\" (ראה דברים יז,יא).</p>\n  \n  <p>Also clarified therein, are the customs and the enactments practiced and enacted [respectively], as seen [fit] by the courts of each generation, for it is forbidden to stray from them as it says \"Do not stray from all that they tell you, right or left\" (Deut. 17:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>, however, takes issue with this (hassagot to Shoreh 1 of Sefer Hamitsvot):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוא זצ\"ל סבור שיש בכלל לאו דלא תסור כל מה שהוא מדברי חכמים בין שהן מצות כגון מקרא מגילה ונר חנוכה או שהן מן התקנות והסייגים...וראוי לפי הדעת הזו להחמיר מאד בדברי סופרים שכולם תורה הם אין ביניהם שום הפרש...ורבותינו בכל התלמוד אומרים הפך מזה שהרי הם דנין כל דברי סופרים להקל. </p>\n  \n  <p>He [Maimonides] OBM holds that the prohibition of \"Do not stray\" includes all that stems from the Sages, whether they be mitsvot, such as the reading of the Megillah, and the lamp of Hannukkah, or whether they be protective enactments...And it would be appropriate according to this view to be very stringent with Rabbinic matters, for they are all Torah; there is no difference between them...But our Sages state the opposite throughout the Talmud, for they judge all rabbinic matters leniently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His own position, however is not exactly clear and their dispute centers around the core of the question: if rabbinic authority is rabbinic, that is circular, and if it is Biblical, what's the source.</p>\n\n<p>One likely approach is that according to Ramban, although rabbinic enactments lack formal authority on the basis of an actual biblical commandment, they are supported by something more fundamental than technical law itself.</p>\n\n<p>One example of such an approach is that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elchonon_Wasserman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Elhanan Wasserman</a> (Kuntres Divrei Soferim), who explains that according to Ramban, it is understood that the rabbis reflect the will of God; thus, one's internal sense of morality compels one to submit to rabbinic authority:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה\"ט אנו חייבין לעשות כדבריהן שהרי אנו מקיימין בזה רצון השי\"ת שהסכימה דעתן לדעתו, ומ\"מ כיון שלא בא עליהן צווי מפורש בתורה הן קלין מדברי תורה המפורשין... דכל מה שצוו חכמים אנו יודעין שכן הוא גם רצון ה' ודבר זה לעשות רצונו ית\"ש כל באי עולם מצווין ועומדין מתחל' ברייתן ע\"ז דכל הנמצאים נבראו לעשות רצון קונם וכל פעל ד' למענהו</p>\n  \n  <p>And for this reason we are obligated to act according to their instruction, for in so-doing we fulfill the will of God, for their thinking matches His. Nevertheless, since there is no explicit commandment in the Torah regarding these instructions, they are more lenient than explicit commandments of the Torah...for all that the sages commanded - we know that such is the will of God. And this thing - doing the will of God - all inhabitants of the world are obligated in this, from their very inception, for all creations were created to do the will of their creator, and all of God's creation is for His sake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His mentor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Shkop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Shimon Shkop</a> writes very similarly in Shaarei Yosher (1 (S'fekot),7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עלינו להזהר במצוות חז\"ל עפ\"י הכרת שכלנו דכיון דהם מצאו לטוב לתקן ולגזור כן הוא האמת והטוב לפנינו וכמו השכל מסכים לשמוע בקול ה' כן השכל גוזר להזהר בכל מה שהזהירו חז\"ל ורבותינו הקדושים</p>\n  \n  <p>It is our responsibility to be careful with the commandments of the Sages, on the basis of our cognitive awareness that since they saw fit to enact, such is the truth and the good, as far as we are concerned. And just as the intellect agrees to submit to God's voice, so does the intellect mandate to be careful with all that the Sages and our holy rabbis warned us about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A second example of such an approach would be to suggest that the authority of the rabbis is rooted in tradition, which is viewed as being an independently authoritative source. That is to say, we the Jewish people have a tradition that (certain) rabbis carry authority, and it is our prerogative to follow tradition.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This could perhaps be inferred from Ramban (ibid) who emphasizes the view of R. Nahman (Shabbat 23a) that rabbinic legislation is based on the verse \"Consult you father, and he will inform you; your elders, and they will tell you\" (Deut. 32:7).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב נחמן אמר שאל אביך ויגדך זקניך ויאמרו לך...אין להם סמך אלא בפסוק שאל אביך ויגדך זקניך ויאמרו לך...שאין זה בא בכלל הכתוב שאמר כי יפלא ממך דבר למשפט אלא בכלל שאל אביך ויגדך זקניך ויאמרו לך שהיא צוואה לקבל מן הזקנים על הכלל. </p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Nahman said \"Consult your father, and he will inform you; your elders, and they will tell you\" they have no basis except for [this verse] for this is not included in the verse \"When the legal matter confounds you\" (Deut. 17:18), but rather included in \"Consult your father...\" which is an instruction to heed Elders in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A variation of this, would be that the rabbinic <em>right to legislate</em> is a matter of tradition (not that <em>following</em> them, is a matter of tradition) similar to a halakha l'Moshe miSinai. This seems to be the understanding of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ben_Joseph_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses di Trani</a> who writes the following in fifth chapter of his introduction to Kiryat Sefer:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה דלדעת הרמב\"ן ז\"ל אין לדברי חכמים שום שורש בתורה...אלא שנראה מדבריו כי מפי הקבלה הורשו מאתו ית' לתקן ולסדר</p>\n  \n  <p>It appears that according to Ramban OBM, the authority of the sages has no basis in the Torah...rather it appears from his words, that on the basis of tradition, they were authorized from Him to order and arrange.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One can infer this from Ramban himself, who writes (ibid):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהורשו מאתו ית' מפי הקבלה לתקן ולסדר </p>\n  \n  <p>That they were authorized from Him on the basis of tradition, to enact and order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[It could be argued that these last two approaches pegging rabbinic authority on tradition (that the Jewish people have a tradition that (certain) rabbis carry authority, and R. Di Trani's view that the rabbis have a tradition), are not mutually exclusive. The former relates to our obligation to heed the Sages, whereas the latter relates to the source for the rabbis themselves to make these rules in the first place].</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Scope of This Authority</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that not all rabbinic authority in necessarily rooted in the same source</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to Rambam <em>all</em> rabbininc authority is rooted in the verse \"According to the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.\" (Deut. 17:11).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This includes their own takkanot, as we brought above (from his introduction to MT), and seems to even includes enactments not meant to protect a particular biblical commandment, as he writes at the end of his introduction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש מצות אחרות שנתחדשו אחרי מתן תורה וקבעו אותן נביאים וחכמים ופשטו בכל ישראל כגון מקרא מגלה וחנכה ותשעה באב...כל אלו המצות חייבין אנו לקבלם ולשמרם שנ' לא תסור מן הדבר אשר יגידו לך ימין ושמאל </p>\n  \n  <p>And there are other mitsvot that were introduced after the giving of the Torah, and prophets and sages enacted them, and they spread through all of Israel, such as the Megillah reading, Hannukkah, and Tisha B'av...We are required to accept all of these mitsvot, and to observe them, as it says \"Do not stray from the matter that they tell you, to the right or to the left\" (Deut. 17:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also includes their interpretation of the Torah, as he writes in Sefer HaMitsvot (Asseh: 174):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שצונו לשמוע לבית דין הגדול ולעשות כל מה שיצוו בו מאיסור והיתר. ואין הבדל בזה בין הדבר שיסברוהו או הדבר שיוציאוהו בהקש מן ההקשים שהתורה נדרשת בהן או הדבר שיסכימו עליו שהוא סוד התורה...והוא אמרו יתעלה (ר\"פ שופטי') על פי התורה אשר יורוך.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We have already noted that Ramban disagrees with Rambam about the extent of rabbinic authority included in biblical law. <em>However</em>, he seems to agree that some rabbinic law is included in biblical law. Specifically, he seems to hold that those enactments that are meant to safeguard biblical law, are themselves biblical, as he writes in his commentary to Deuteronomy (4:2)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רמב\"ן פרשת ואתחנן \n  ומה שתקנו חכמים משום גדר, כגון שניות לעריות וכיוצא בהן, זו היא מצוה מן התורה</p>\n  \n  <p>What the Sages decreed as a safeguard, such as secondary forbidden sexual relationships, and the like is a biblical commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: the legislative authority of the rabbis may be biblical (Rambam), or their biblical authority may be limited to enacting safeguards to biblical commandments (Ramban), with their authority in other areas possibly stemming from their role as moral authorities (R. Wasserman), the weight of tradition that their office carries, or a divine mandate transmitted orally (R. di Trani).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Circularity</strong>: To rehash the relevance to the circularity issue, rabbis claiming biblical authority (Rambam and to a limited extent Ramban) isn't logically fallacious, as is a circular argument of basing authority on themselves. It may of course be false (if their understanding of the Bible is wrong). Similarly one can deny that rabbi are moral authorities (R. Wasserman), but this nevertheless avoids the issue of circularity, as the claim is not that they are authoritative because they say so, but because it is supposedly axiomatic. Similarly, if tradition carries its own authority, and by extension that of the rabbis, rabbinic authority wouldn't be circular, although again, would could deny the premise that tradition carries authority. Lastly, the claim that the rabbis are endowed with a divine mandate (R. di Trani) isn't circular, although one can of course claim that it is false.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is answered directly by Rambam in his introduction to the Mishna Torah. This authority to make new laws was taught directly by Moshe Rabbeinu as cited below from Deuteronomy 17:11.</p>\n\n<p>\"The mitzvot given to Moses at Mount Sinai were all given together with their explanations, as implied by [Exodus 24:12]: \"And I will give you the tablets of stone, the Torah, and the mitzvah.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The Torah\" refers to the Written Law; \"the mitzvah,\" to its explanation. [God] commanded us to fulfill \"the Torah\" according to [the instructions of] \"the mitzvah.\" \"The mitzvah\" is called the Oral Law.</p>\n\n<p>Moses, our teacher, personally transcribed the entire Torah before he died. He gave a Torah scroll to each tribe and placed another scroll in the ark as a testimonial, as [Deuteronomy 31:26] states: \"Take this Torah scroll and place it [beside the ark...] and it will be there as a testimonial.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The mitzvah\" - i.e., the explanation of the Torah - he did not transcribe. Instead, he commanded it [verbally] to the elders, to Joshua, and to the totality of Israel, as [Deuteronomy 13:1] states: \"Be careful to observe everything that I prescribe to you.\" For this reason, it is called the Oral Law.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the Oral Law was not transcribed, Moses, our teacher, taught it in its entirety in his court to the seventy elders. Elazar, Pinchas, and Joshua received the tradition from Moses. [In particular, Moses] transmitted the Oral Law to Joshua, who was his [primary] disciple, and instructed him regarding it.\".....</p>\n\n<p>\"From the entire [body of knowledge stemming from] the two Talmuds, the Tosefta, the Sifra, and the Sifre, can be derived the forbidden and the permitted, the impure and the pure, the liable and those who are free of liability, the invalid and the valid as was received [in tradition], one person from another, [in a chain extending back] to Moses at Mount Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>Also, [the sources mentioned above] relate those matters which were decreed by the sages and prophets in each generation in order to \"build a fence around the Torah.\" We were explicitly taught about [this practice] by Moses, as [implied by Leviticus 18:30]: \"And you shall observe My precepts,\" [which can be interpreted to mean]: \"Make safeguards for My precepts.\"</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, it includes the customs and ordinances that were ordained or practiced in each generation according to [the judgment of] the governing court of that generation. It is forbidden to deviate from [these decisions], as [implied by Deuteronomy 17:11]: \"Do not deviate from the instructions that they will give you, left or right.\"</p>\n\n<p>It also includes marvelous judgments and laws which were not received from Moses, but rather were derived by the courts of the [later] generations based on the principles of Biblical exegesis. The elders of those generations made these decisions and concluded that this was the law. Rav Ashi included in the Talmud this entire [body of knowledge, stemming] from the era of Moses, our teacher, until his [own] era.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The comments, above, approach the correct analysis.</p>\n\n<p>This question is discussed in detail in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.23a.45?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud Shabbat 23a</a>, near the middle of the page (as seen in the Sefaria site).</p>\n\n<p>There is a statement that says that one makes the blessing \"Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Chanukah light.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is a given that Chanukah, itself, is a Rabbinical holiday, so the Talmud is puzzled that in the blessing, we say that <strong>G-d</strong> commanded us to light, when we know that it was the Rabbis who commanded us.</p>\n\n<p>That leads to your, and the Talmud's question, how is it that G-d commanded us, i.e. where did G-d give the authority to rabbis to make commandments that we have to follow as if they were Torah commandments?</p>\n\n<p>Disputed sources - Rav Avia says from Deut. 17:11 (what @DannySchoemann cited), and Rav Nechamia says it comes from Deut. 32:7 - \"Ask your father and he will tell you; your elders and they will say it to you.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'll try to add some further commentary to this analysis, later - unless others wish to edit here, further.</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah is relevant and applicable for all times. How we understand and apply this to our lives is important to understand which is why we are told in perke avos aseh lecha rav</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam in the 8th principle writes that the entire Torah, down to the last detail, including dates and events, are the direct word of G-d:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהוא כולה מפי הגבורה... ושהוא [משה] במעלת לבלר שקורין לפניו והוא כותב כולה תאריכיה וסיפוריה ומצותיה... הכל מפי הגבורה והכל תורת ה' תמימה טהורה קדושה אמת</p>\n<p>It is entirely from the \"mouth\" of the Almighty, and [Moshe] was at the level of a scribe, that you dictate to him and he writes all of it, the dates and stories and mitzvos... all of it is from the \"mouth\" of the Almighty, and it is all the Torah of Hashem, whole, pure, holy, true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and therefore every letter (or word, depending on which translation you go with) of the Torah contains unfathomably deep Divine wisdom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא כל אות שבה יש בה חכמות ונפלאות למי שהבינו ה' ולא תושג תכלית חכמתה</p>\n<p>Every word in it contains wisdom and wonders to whomever Hashem grants understanding, and the entirety of its wisdom cannot be grasped</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So given that every letter/word of the Torah contains Divine wisdom and truth, it stands to reason that those Divine truths will remain eternal truths, and this applies to every word of the Torah.

(see sefer chosen yeshuas that goes thru why most areas of science was given at sinai for this reason)\nsee igros moshe volume aroch chaim 4 chapter 49 for a lengthy elaboration as to how all hashkafic matters are included in the torah that was given at sinai, and that it was given forever!!!</p>\n\n\n",

Some consider him Pasul Lakehuna as there is a Kal Vachomer from the Almana Lecohen Gadol.  Indeed, this one is not forbidden to all the Cohanim and her child is Challal, a fortiori that the non-Jew who is forbidden to all, her child is Pagum Lakehuna.</p>\n<p>​​\nSome understand that we are only talking about female children (Rashi, Rif, so it seems from Yerushalmi Yevamot 4.15).  Indeed, the boy not being Cohen, which Isur Kehuna can he have?  A Cohenet woman is not forbidden to marry a Pasul.</p>\n<p>Others understand that the boys are also spoken of (Rosh, Ramban in the Sefer Hazechut), since the Almana Lecohen Gadol has Pesulim children, both boys and girls, here as well.  If so, that boys are Pesulim, and they should make their sons Pesulim from generation to generation, even if they marry an Israelite (there is a Gemara in Yerushalmi Kiddushin 3.12 which seems to disprove this to  the Second Generation according to the reading of the Pene Moshe).</p>\n<p>​​\nA question arises from the fact that Rav (Yevamot 45a), is reported in the Gemara afterwards, and it seems that the man who addresses him is considered Kosher entirely, likewise for the other Amorayim who tell him to hide  his defect.</p>\n<p>Some reply that the Gemara in conclusion abandoned the Qal Vachomer of Almana Lecohen Gadol (this is the opinion of the Rashba, the first of the two opinions quoted in the Rif).</p>\n<p>Some do not know how to comment on the contradiction between these two parts of the Gemara Yevamot 45a (this can be said both for those who say that the question is only about the girls (the Rif) and for those who say that the  question is for girls and boys (The Magid Misne)).</p>\n<p>Some think that this Qal Vachomer is a nickname Qal Vachomer, he is Miderabanan.</p>\n<p>Others say (Yevamot 45a) that the Almana Lecohen Gadol makes Pesula the girl and not the boy, and as Rav and the Amorayim quoted after him deal with the problem of a boy, there is no contradiction, the girl is Pesula  and the boy is fully Kosher (Rashi, Rambam).</p>\n<p>Another question arises from the fact that the son of a non-Jew with a married Jewish woman is Kosher because he is not fit to give Kiddushin according to one Girsa (Yevamot 45b), and according to another because his offspring with a Bat  Israel does not relate to him at all.  Some, according to this Gemara think that the whole problem of Psul of children of a non-Jew with a Bat Israel is canceled (It seems that this is the opinion of Sheiltot 25, Haemek Davar, following the Nimuke Yosef, Rashba and Ramban in 45b).\n​​\n​​</p>\n<p>For the Halacha, see Shut Maharshal at the end of siman <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43039&st=&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפי מה שהוכחתי בראיות ברורים בפרק החולץ דבת גוי ועבד מן הישראלית אינה פגומה אלא לכתחילה אבל נשאת לא תצא. ...‏,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I already demonstrated with clear proofs in Perek Hacholets<sup>[1]</sup> (see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14087&st=&pgnum=54\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yam Shel Shlomo</a>  n<sup>o</sup> 38<sup>[2]</sup>) that  <strong>a daugther from a non Jewish or a Slave and a Jewish women is dammaged only lechatechila but if she is already spoused [to a Cohen], she has not to divorce.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This  Shut is cited by the main Poskim, in Chelkat Mechokek (sk 26) and in Bet Shmuel (sk 39), Baer Heitev (sk 47) Even Haezer Siman 7, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7523?\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sayf 17</a>.

[the offspring of a union with] any consanguineous relative with whom cohabitation is forbidden; this is the ruling of <strong>Rabbi Akiba.

Who is meant by 'All agree'? - Simeon from Timnata. For although Simeon from Timnata stated that the offspring of a union forbidden under the penalty of flogging is not a bastard, his statement applies only to the offspring of a union forbidden under the penalty of flogging, since the betrothal in such a case is valid but here, in the case of an idolater and a slave,  <strong>since betrothal in their case is invalid, they are like those whose union is subject to the penalty of kareth.</strong>  (Diverse opinion are cited, ... \" the 'Elders of the South') - who stated that if an idolater or a slave had intercourse with a daughter of an Israelite, the child born is untainted!\" ... \"Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi said: The child is tainted.\" ...  <strong>for all Amoraim who declare the child fit admit that he is ineligible for the priesthood.</strong>  \"And Rab also ruled that the child is legitimate.\" ... \"Rab Mattena also ruled that the child is legitimate. Rab Judah also ruled that the child is legitimate.\" ... \"Rav Shesheth said: Rav Gaza told me that it was not Rabbi Jose Bar Abin but Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Zebida, and that he declared the child to be legitimate, both in the case of the married, as well as in that of the unmarried woman. \" \"Go and conceal your identity or marry one of your own kind.\" ... \" Either go abroad or marry one of your own kind.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an apparent contradiction between the fact that they say that the children are \"damaged\" (pegumim) and the fact that the advice is to marry \"go to a place where you are unknown and where you might in consequence pass as a legitimate Israelite and be allowed to marry a Jewess! (Yevamot 45a\" In such case, if the daughter marry a Cohen, the offspring would be Chalal.

    "content": "# Resources for those beginning to keep Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are some useful and accessible resources for those who are just beginning to keep the Sabbath? General primers, overviews of the Law, sources of advice on making things easier, and guides to making a traditional Shabbos at home would all be welcomed...as would be sources of Shabbat-related inspiration to read during and before Shabbat. What key books might form a good basic toolkit for beginning Shabbat learning? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Here are some resources I would consider useful/practical for those new to Shabbos and seeking to cultivate an Orthodox observance, based on my own experiences as a baalas teshuvah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Shabbos primers:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Broad overviews can be found which aspire to put everything you need to know about Shabbos in one book. Many of these, such as such as Noam Zion's \"A Day Apart\" and Dayan Dr. I. Grunfeld's \"The Sabbath: A Guide to Its Understanding and Observance\" are quite beautiful, and mix inspiration and instruction with sound advice about Sabbath practicalities. However, I am not aware of any single book that actually meets the goal of being everything you need for Shabbos. In my experience, these broad overviews are really best suited as sources of uplift and inspiration in one's Shabbos-keeping journey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guides to the Law:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Beyond a basic breakdown of the 39 melachos such as can be found <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">online</a>, I would suggest only a book of piskei din, preferably listed by activity in (English) alphabetical order. It is really important to have a print version of this book so that one can refer to it Shabbos, when one is wondering, as one frequently will, whether it is legal to do something. These books can be hard to find--for some reason, they aren't marketed to baalei teshuvah--but are worth their weight in gold. A short list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>R'Yaakov Goldstein, <em>A Semikha Aid for Learning the Laws of Shabbos, vols. 1-3</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Harav S.Z. Auerbach, <em>Shemiras Shabbos K'hilchasah</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Dovid Ribiat, <em>The 39 Melochos: An Elucidation of the 39 Melochos from Concept to Practical Application, vols. 1-4</em> </p></li>\n<li><p>R'Yehoshua Neuwirth, <em>Shemirath Shabbath, vols. 1-3</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Simcha Bunin Cohen, <em>The Shabbos Home, vols. 1-2</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want shorter, perhaps more accessible guides to start off, books oriented toward children and teens can be a great option. I liked <em>The 39 Avoth Melacha of Shabbath</em> by Baruch Chait and <em>Can I Play Chess on Shabbas</em> by Joe Bobker.</p>\n\n<p>In the other direction, an excellent and extremely comprehensive guide to the positive and negative mitzvot of Shabbos, including piskei din for every sort of situation imaginable, is the full seven-volume set by Rabbi Cohen: in addition to both volumes of <em>The Shabbos Home</em>, mentioned above, it includes <em>The Shabbos Kitchen</em>, <em>Muktzeh: A Practical Guide</em>, <em>Radiance of Shabbos</em> (\"The complete laws of the Shabbos and Festival candle-lighting, Kiddush, Lechem Mishneh, meals, Bircas HaMazon, and Havdalah\"), <em>Sanctity of Shabbos</em> (\"A comprehensive guide to the laws of Shabbos and Yom Tov as they apply to a non-Jew doing work on behalf of a Jew\"), and\n<em>Aura of Shabbos</em> (\"A selection of relevant Erev Shabbos and Shabbos laws\"). A further book of Rabbi Cohen's to add to this collection might be <em>Shabbat, The Right Way: Resolving Halachic Dilemmas</em>, which seems to be an extension of <em>Aura of Shabbos</em>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Guides to Making Shabbos/Positive Mitzvot:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although there are a lot of books covering this topic, I think spending Shabbos with frum families is both necessary and sufficient to learn the basics of positive mitzvot, as well as how to make Shabbos. That said, some good books available are these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Shabbos: Tasting Eternity</em> by Rabbi Daniel Yaakov Travis</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Friday Night and Beyond: The Shabbat Experience</em> by Lori Palatnik</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shabbos recipes, as well as guidelines for preparation and service of the traditional Shabbat meals are not too hard to find online. An excellent cookbook including details of Jewish tradition for Shabbos and every day is <em>Spice and Spirit</em> by Tzuvia Emmer and Tzipora Reitman. </p>\n\n<p>Laws about reheating and use of the blech may be useful to print before Shabbos from a source like <a href=\"http://nebula.wsimg.com/5d97cd2f36379a4ad44e1db962373f57?AccessKeyId=D35ECF040CB510101C31&disposition=0&alloworigin=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spiritual and Inspirational Resources:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am not qualified to comment on or even list classical writings on the topic of Shabbos. There is a huge body of Shabbos literature, most of which, I am quite sure, is worth reading, although not much of which could be read by beginners without a chavrusa. Personally, what I found to be inspiring in my early days of keeping Shabbos were the remarks on the subject by Herman Wouk (in <em>This is My G-d</em>), Jonathan Sacks, and Abraham Joshua Heschel. </p>\n\n<p><strong>To read/consult during Shabbos:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In general, all books related to Shabbos are ideal to read and consult during Shabbos: especially at the beginning, Shabbos is an optimal time to learn about Shabbos. But there are some specific things that are useful, if not essential, to have in print for the actual day of Shabbat. The first would be the book of piskei din mentioned previously. Others are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A Tanakh broken up into parshios, haftaros, and additional readings by week, ideally with Rashi and/or other commentary (or with a separate book of divrei Torah)</p></li>\n<li><p>A siddur or bentcher with the texts of Friday night kiddush, Saturday kiddush, al natilas yadayim/hamotzi, table hymns, bentching, and psalms, ideally including translation and/or commentary</p></li>\n<li><p>A siddur with the Shabbos davening: weekday minchah, candle-lighting, kabbalas Shabbos, Shabbos maariv, Shabbos shacharis, Shabbos mussaf, the Torah reading, Minchah, havdalah and weekday maariv. (A \"synagogue companion\" for Shabbos might also be useful.)</p></li>\n<li><p>A songbook with z'miros</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p><em>Good luck and Gut Shabbos!</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Two online resources from Morasha:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://nleresources.com/nle-morasha-syllabus/jewish-calendar/shabbat-ii-the-shabbat-experience/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Shabbat Experience  - Insight into Friday night seudah & mitzvos</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://nleresources.com/nle-morasha-syllabus/jewish-calendar/shabbat-i-plugging-into-the-goals-of-life/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat I: Plugging into the Goals of Life</a> (basic concepts of Shabbos)</p>\n\n<p>And a book to start with - Lori Palatnik's <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0765760673\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friday Night and Beyond</a>.

The Geonim disagreed, at least about taking the oil, and held that even if it went out on its own, you should save the leftover oil for tomorrow's lighting.

Three reasons are given for this: 1) Not using them for personal benefit makes it clear that they are for the purpose of mitzva and persumei nisa. 2) Since the candles commemorate the miracle that occurred with the Menorah in the Beis Hamikdash, using their light is forbidden just as the general rules of hekdesh forbid people to benefit from the lights of the Beis Hamikdash Menorah. 3) Dedicating them completely to the mitzva accords honor to the mitzva. The Rosh writes, based on this third reason, that even temporary use of the Chanuka lights is forbidden. It is permissible to remain in the house while the candles are burning even if there is no other light. According to some poskim, walking around the house is not a violation of the prohibition of hana'ah. Likewise, Rav Chaim Kanievsky holds that they may be used as a night light for someone who is scared of the dark. According to Rav Nissim Karelitz and Rav Shmuel Wosner, it is forbidden to benefit from the heat produced by the candles. It is, however, permissible to enjoy the scent of the candles because the fragrance added to the candles is not designated for the mitzva. According to Rav Chaim Kanievsky, only unintentional pleasure is permitted from the fragrance. Improper use of the candles does not invalidate the mitzva.\n  [שו\"ע תרעג, א, משנ\"ב ח-יא ושעה\"צ יא; ביאורים ומוספים 'דרשו', 13-15 ו־17; ועוד בנוגע לשימוש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken from the email: Daf HaYomi B'Halacha Daily Email - 21 Kislev/Dec 3</p>\n\n\n",

Nonetheless, Potiphar wasn't angry at Yosef, because he believe the words of Yosef more (than his wife.)

Thus, he hired Yosef for the purpose of having sexual relations with his wife.</p>\n\n<p>The last idea would explain why he wasn't that surprised by what she said. Yet, Potiphar, also knew that she had requested Yosef to lie with her multiple times and that Yosef refused.

But it seems to me that there’s a more subtle question: If one has the option, are there spiritual reasons it is <em>preferable</em> not to wear a watch on Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat is “a palace in time”, as Rav Heschel said. It’s holy time that’s separated from the rest of the week, and we are meant to linger in it, not to rush it, not to think about what we need to do when it’s over. Of course, there are plenty of good reasons to care about time on Shabbat — timing of services, of gatherings with friends and family, etc. But what if one is blessed with a Shabbat where one is free of all such concerns and can just rely on the sun and stars to tell the appointed times? In that case, doesn’t it seem like one’s Shabbat consciousness would be “higher” without a watch on to remind one of “chol time”?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How is it that the Talmud can make historical mistakes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A Rav told me that when it comes to science and nature, the Talmud can say incorrect things (i.e. about animals, cosmology) because they were going by the Greeks and Romans. (Where he gets permission to say what details in the Talmud we can reject and what we must believe, I do not know.) But he said that the Talmud is considered to be the true and reliable Oral Law when it comes to Halacha and history. So my question is, is the Rav right, and how should we take statements in the Talmud that appear to make incorrect statements about history?</p>\n\n<p>Now, I know for some things, you can argue about what they say. For example, although historians and archeologists dispute a lot of stories the Talmud has on the Churban and actions of Roman Emperors, you can say perhaps the historians made mistakes. And where it discusses Adam and Noah and things like that, you can say they are speaking in terms of whatever allegory it is that Genesis means in the level of Sod.</p>\n\n<p>But there are still things that just cannot be explained away. For example, history of the Persian Period discussed in the Talmud is so different from indisputable evidence that there were more kings of Persia, that the period lasted over 100 years longer than the Talmud and Seder Olam Rabba says (even resulting in our 5776 calendar of being about 165 years too short), that there is no way to say that Achashveirosh was the father of Darius, etc. I also know that not all Rishonim are as faithful to Seder Olam Rabba and what the Talmud says about historical events, so this is nothing new.</p>\n\n<p>But in light of what I was told, how do I answer this question? Must we, can we, further shrink the range of topics in which we can and should trust our Chachamim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I will only address your question about the history, not other scientific inconsistencies in the Talmud.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>[Strangely] The Jewish nation didn't have a tradition of writing things down.

The current system of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Anno_Mundi</a> is, unfortunately, not a tradition, it was reestablished by [probably] Rambam based on previous Rabbinical sources (like Seder Olam), but the Jews never recited a year's number on Rosh Hashana, for example.<br>\n.<br>\nThe Tanakh itself never attributes an event to an \"absolute\" year Anno Mundi, but only \"since event X\", be it the Exodus or coronation of a king.</p></li>\n<li><p>We learn it from the way the Torah reflects the history - very hmmm inconsistently.

Let me explain: </p>\n\n<p>The roots of history events are rooted in \"Kabbalic\" concepts - what a nation represents (Egypt, Rome etc), what a person represents (a King or a general or a wise man), what a place represents and what the time represents in general terms. Interactions between those ideas teach us about the big heavenly plan. However, the details of their implementations (why it happened exactly there in that time by those people) are only known to G-d, and therefore are not of our [direct] concern.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we know [from the beginning of the Creation - תהו ובהו וחושך] that the Second Temple will be destroyed by descendants of Eysov, i.e. Edom, approx. in the year 4000 Anno Mundi.

But it is unavoidable to have slightly different outcomes depending on different perspectives. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam explains that in early times, when the students spent much time with their rabbis, they would even pick up their attitude and perspective to the extent that there would be no argument among the students when tackling new issues. They would all view it the same, with the perspective that was passed on to them.</p>\n\n<p>Although we have these differences of opinion, the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.3b.12?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud in Chagiga (3b)</a> tells us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should a man say: How in these circumstances shall I learn Torah? Therefore the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%A7%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%91_%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">text says</a>: ‘All of them are given from one Shepherd’. One God gave them; one leader uttered them from the mouth of the Lord of all creation, blessed be He; for it is written: (Exodus 20:1) ‘And God spoke all these words’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tanna_debei_Eliyahu_Zuta,_Seder_Eliyahu_Zuta.2?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanna DeBei Eliyahu (c. 2)</a> likens the relationship of Oral Law and Written Law to a case of a king who gave his servants wheat along with bundles of flax. Those who were smart made fine table cloths from the flax and loaves of bread with the wheat and welcomed the king proudly when he came to check up on them.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for the Torah. We were given the original laws and the rules by which to extrapolate their details and application. With these we produce many volumes of law and thought, all directly based on what we learned and received. There is no outside input. We aren't introducing any ideas outside the framework of the tools which were passed down.</p>\n\n<p>To sum this all up, Oral Law includes those laws which are directly passed down, and those laws which were derived using the tools which were passed down. </p>\n\n<p>Another category is the rabbinic law. These are the rulings of Gezeiros, or boundaries, in which the rabbis decreed certain things in order to round out the biblical laws. This means that at times something might be technically permitted but to the untrained eye it seems no different from what is actually prohibited. In these cases the rabbis outlawed the likeness of the biblical prohibition. Other rabbinic prohibitions are to keep people away from scenarios that would have them easily sin with or without noticing.</p>\n\n<p>These too are actually fulfilling the tradition and are based on their understanding of a situation and what they learned about <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.123b.42-43?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">the role of leaders</a> in enforcing the Torah and making it accessible to all.</p>\n\n<p>Along these lines, the early Great Assembly, the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah, codified and formulated the format of the prayers. Prayer itself is a biblical requirement but its format and timing is rabbinic. But this is all part of Oral Law.</p>\n\n\n",

However, a minor who has not yet said/heard any form of <em>havdala</em> is considered obligated by the rabbis to do so, as is a man who has already said/heard <em>havdala</em> without a cup of wine or the like, so the former person can say it for the latter. <em>Sh'miras Shabas K'hilchasah</em> 58:19. Similarly, since whether a woman is obligated to say/hear <em>havdala</em> by God, by the rabbis, or not at all is a matter of dispute, she cannot say it for a man.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a lot of debate over this question. But it alls tems from the question of whether or not Havdalah is a miswah d'oraita or de'rabbanan. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam holds that it is a miswah d'oraita (commandment directly from the Torah). And he rules that a woman can say her own Qiddush, and say Qiddush for a man since it's a miswah d'oraita. Therefore, to him, since Qiddush and Havdalah have the same status, a woman can say havdalah for a man.\nSources: <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/The%20Mitzvah%20of%20Havdalah%20Part%20I.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/The%20Mitzvah%20of%20Havdalah%20Part%20I.html</a>\n<a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/women-kiddush-havdalah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://torahmitzion.org/learn/women-kiddush-havdalah/</a></p>\n\n<p>As msh210 has noted, other Rabbis disagree on the status of Havdalah, and therefore the permissibility of women to be able to say it for men.</p>\n\n\n",

So the question becomes how does one make up for an essential part of the amida when the time has passed.</p>\n\n<p>Generally for tashlumim one repeats twice the amida that should be said at the time one prays (e.g., twice maariv to make up for a missed minha). The kavana for the first amida is to pray the regular amida with tashlumim being the second amida (see sources <a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Tashlumin\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Now the tashlumim <strong>is not to be able to say ותן ברכה - <em>it is to make up for an invalid amida</em></strong>. The way to make up for an invalid amida is to repeat the amida at the time one prays. As such it is logical to say twice ותן טל ומטר according to the rules of tashlumim.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/21807/do-you-do-a-tashlumin-make-up-on-a-shemoneh-esreh-if-you-later-realize-that-y\">here</a> for additional sources, although I find some of the answers contradictory.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems that this may be a problem, since you don't gain anything by repeating the Amida at Maariv with ותן טל ומטר since you already did that.</p>\n\n<p>(In other words, you didn't say ותן ברכה the first time, nor the second, so what have you achieved by repeating the Amida?)</p>\n\n<p>See the Aruch Hashulchan in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01582.html#HtmpReportNum0107_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן קח - דידין מי שלא התפלל בטעות</a> who mentions similar, but not identical cases:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כ:</strong> וכיון שצריך להתפלל תפילת התשלומין כפי נוסח תפילה של חובה, אף על פי שאינה כפי נוסח התפילה שהוא חייב לשלם, ו<strong>אם כן יש להסתפק להיפך: במקום שלא ירויח מאומה בתפילת ההשלמה</strong>, כגון שלא אמר ''יעלה ויבוא'' בראש חודש במנחה, וצריך להתפלל ערבית שתים בלא ''יעלה ויבוא'', ו<strong>אם כן מה ישתכר</strong>, הלא התפלל בלא ''יעלה ויבוא''? או כגון שטעה במנחה של שבת והתפלל שמונה עשרה ברכות של חול, שהדין שצריך לחזור ולהתפלל של שבת, ונזכר במוצאי שבת וצריך להתפלל שתים של חול. ומה ירויח, הלא כבר התפלל תפילה זו?‏<br/>\n  ולכן יש מרבותינו דסבירא להו <strong>דבכהאי גוונא אינו צריך לחזור ולהתפלל</strong> (תוספות בשם ר''י ריש פרק רביעי). אבל יש מרבותינו שפסקו דצריך לחזור ולהתפלל, משום דמה שהתפלל הוה כאילו אינו מפני שלא התפלל כדין, ולא כן כשמתפלל כזה הוי כדין (שם). וכן פסקו גדולי הפוסקים והטור והשולחן ערוך סעיף י''א, עיין שם.‏<br/>\n  ופשוט הוא דאם ירויח בתפילתו, כגון שגם בלילה ראש חודש, או שטעה במנחה ביום טוב ראשון, או שכח ''טל ומטר'' או ''משיב הרוח'', דגם לדעה ראשונה יחזור ויתפלל. \n  ודע דאף על גב דהלכה כדעה אחרונה, מכל מקום פסקו שיכוין להתפללה בתורת נדבה. ואין הפסד בזה כדי לצאת ידי דעה ראשונה. אבל אינו צריך לחדש בה דבר, מפני שהעיקר כדעה אחרונה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't see anybody discussing your scenario explicitly, since it's unusual to err after half a year of using the other version. :-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>DannyS I think that is a different question. The questioner seemed to be clear (to me) that he was not sure \"one forgot to [consciously] say\" the correct form, ie v'ten beracha. </p>\n\n<p>As for your case, if someone knows that he erred by saying v'ten tal u'mattar early, I saw a Rabbi Daniel Sperling (yeshiva.org.il 5773, ask the Rabbi) who quoted Ishei Israel (23,45) that it would depend where it occurred. In Eretz Yisroel, we really could use rain immediately after Sukkos, but we refrain from doing so because it took two weeks to return from Aliyah l'regel to the further parts of Yerushalayim. It wouldn't be kind to daven for rain before the last Olei Regel get home, but if one did, the rain would be needed and appreciated so one should not repeat. </p>\n\n<p>However, in Chutz laAretz, rain is (presumably) not needed until 60 days after the tekufah of Tishri. Therefore, if someone said v'ten tal u'mattar one day early, he should repeat shmoneh esrei. (End of Rabbi Sperling's response.)</p>\n\n<p>Based on a quick reading of relevant passages in Shulchan Aruch and Mishneh Berura available to me at present, there is reason to say that in such a case it would be worthwhile to make a condition in one's mind:\n\"If this is necessary then I am saying it for a tashlumim\" \"OTOH if it is not necessary, I am saying the extra Amidah as a Nedavah\" (Donation Amidah).</p>\n\n\n",

We have counter-examples as well, such as the prophet <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_102.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Achiya Hashiloni being fooled by Yeravam (Sanhedrin 102)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I know someone who, as a child, was forewarned by a rabbi to keep away from someone who was 11 years old at that time. As he grew up, and avoided this other person without knowing why, this other boy was eventually caught doing trouble with kids.</p>\n\n<p>In the Talmud we find such knowledge attributed to astrologers. An example is in <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/shabbath/shabbath_156.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos 156b</a>, where Rabbi Nachman b. Yitzchok's mother was forewarned about her son having a tendency to steal. She rectified this by making sure to always cover his head.</p>\n\n\n",

There might have also been some other system of writing it down that wasn't formal music notation; I remember, when I was learning my <em>haftarah</em> portion, writing dots above some of the phrases to show melodic shape (up/down, long/short) even though it wasn't a full musical notation.  (It was a study aid.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is no one answer for this question. Because there seems to have been three distinct developments for the Cantillation: Ashkenazi, Old Mizrahi, and Modern Sepharadi.</p>\n\n<p>The Ashkenazim are noted as being the first to develop musical motifs for all of the cantillation symbols. This makes the most sense since Europe was very focused on writing down music, and for adapting the music system based on the Greek tone system. So for the Ashkenazi communities of yore and today, they are more used to thinking of the te'amei miqra as a musical system, rather than a grammatical system that occasionally uses musical motifs to aid in grammatical emphasis. They were notating their system before the 15th century. In the 1500s we have Sephardic scholars mentioning that the Ashkenazim have already written down and put their cantillation to music. For written Ashkenazi sources, much has been discussed and brought down. Here is a snippet of information along with the source to find out more:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most valuable of them all, for the Ashkenazic traditions, is to be\n  found in Cantor Abraham Baer's \"Ba'al Tefillah,\" 1877, pp. 30-42. The\n  value of the earlier tables (e.g., those of Bartolocci, A. Kircher, P.\n  Guarin, etc.) is detracted from by unnecessary elaboration, and\n  especially by experiments in transcribing the notes backward, so as to\n  go with the Hebrew from right to left, which have misled later\n  students. Such, too, is the case with the transcription made by the\n  monk Böschenstein for Reuchlin, and printed in his \"De Accentibus\"\n  (Hagenau, 1518), at end of Book III., where the cantillation, reversed\n  and given in the tenor as a canto fermo, is ludicrously accompanied by\n  three other harmony parts. But Reuchlin's tenor cantillation, when\n  retranscribed, is particularly valuable as showing that the tradition\n  has not appreciably varied in four centuries, save possibly in the\n  rarer jubilations, such as \"Ḳarne Farah,\" where license is always\n  taken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3986-cantillation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3986-cantillation</a></p>\n\n<p>Old Mizrahi communities, whether Yemenite, Iraqi, Egyptian, etc, had very few melodies for select symbols. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantillation#Yemenite_melodies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even into the modern times the Yemenites only have 8 musical motifs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/Liturgy/Cantillation.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">with the Karaites having a similar system.</a> The Karaites are considered a reliable source since it's also likely that Ben Asher (author of the masoretic text) was a Karaite and just as we can rely on his text, we can also rely on their musical system.</p>\n\n<p>Sephardic and Mizrahi authors going back to the 1300s into the 1500s write that their cantillation system has very few musical motifs, with most of them sharing the same motif, or not having any musical value at all. They also note this is in stark contrast with the Ashkenazim who have music for all the symbols and have already written them down:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZUI75.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZUI75.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\nImage from Idehlson's Thesaurus of Oriental Hebrew Melodies Vol II</p>\n\n<p>By 1798 we start seeing shifts in the Mizrahi/Sephardi communities. In 1798 the French Musicologist Guillaume André Villoteau noted the Egyptian musical cantillation system. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=JUv0AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA473&dq=de%20l%27etat%20actuel%20de%20l%27art%20musical%20en%20egypte%20473&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAGoVChMIsq2-_6r8xgIVFjGICh2N3wrC#v=onepage&q=de%20l'etat%20actuel%20de%20l'art%20musical%20en%20egypte%20473&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">His notation shows musical motifs for 19 of the cantillation marks, but still lacks musical motifs for all the symbols.</a> More than likely the expanding of music to cover most of the symbols was due to the mixing of various Jewish communities and their musical systems. Which brings us to Modern Sephardic.</p>\n\n<p>The Modern Sephardic melodies are all very similar, culminating into something called the \"Sephardi Yerushalmi\" tradition. Even if you were to listen to the \"Egyptian\" or \"Syrian\" systems, you will see bits and pieces of it in the Yerushalmi and vice versa. Now nearly if not all of the cantillation symbols for the Sephardim have musical motifs, matching the Ashkenazi system in that now it's more of a musical system than a grammatical system. i have acquired sheet music from the Egyptian Alexandrian community before the 1950s expulsion that shows musical motifs for nearly all the symbols, but still lacks a tune for Qarneh Farah.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Pl0BQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Pl0BQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

Should there be a reason to suspect otherwise, you must trace back until there is no more reason for suspicion. (and then once again you can rely on chazaka) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer (supported by comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/47968/1516\">here</a>) is that one must trace one's maternal line until one reaches a \"confirmed\" Jew (i.e., by an Orthodox ketubah, or some other formal endorsement of one's Jewishness by an Orthodox musmakh--perhaps also including a beit din record, a burial, etc.).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>There are various batei din around the world who will do a \"birur yahadut,\" an investigation, and then issue you a \"Teudat Yahadut\" or a \"Teudat Ravakut\" or an \"Ishur Yahadut.\"  They will tell you exactly what you need. The RCA for example asks for this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Copies of passport, birth certificate, driver's license, teudat zehut\n  (if you are Israeli); passport photo; family tree going back at least\n  3 generations with as many details as possible; mother's birth\n  certficate; letter from a rabbi confirming you are jewish; parents'\n  ketubah; any other documents (including diploma from jewish day\n  school, grandparents' burial records from jewish cemetery, letters\n  from family members describing jewish practices).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I was told that census records and even pictures of your ancestors may also carry some weight, though I'm not sure how much.)</p>\n\n<p>The Sydney Beth Din asks for:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Copies of birth certificate, mother's birth certificate, driver's\n  license, parents' ketubah, parents' marriage certificate, and get or\n  death records in case of remarriage; affirmation that you are Jewish\n  by 2 Jewish people not related to you nor 2 each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is not exactly clear from the above how much you need for a proof. However, in my experience, it seems you need either one Orthodox religious document from the maternal line (=ketubah/get/conversion certificate/record of burial in an Orthodox cemetery), or two letters from Orthodox rabbis attesting that you are Jewish. However, I was asked for more, and <a href=\"http://www.israelhayom.com/2012/02/05/groom-to-be-goes-100-years-back-in-time-to-prove-he-is-jewish/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it seems</a> some people are asked <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/teudat%20ravakut%20app%20checklist.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for less</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For practical purposes, it may be best to contact a local beis din and try to get a teudat yahadut from them; if this fails, you can then try in higher batei din. If all that fails, you may need a giur l'chumra or even a giur.</p>\n\n\n",

At some point, probably near the time of the Babylonian exile, they are started to be referred to as \"Yehudim\" (Judah-im) (Jews). This is indicated in the Book of Esther, which is replete with the term. </p>\n\n<p>It would be pure sophistry to suggest that the Book of Esther is only about the tribe of Judah, which was endangered by the evil decree of Ahasuerus and Haman, while all the other tribes of Israel were unaffected by the decree.</p>\n\n<p>This is also indicated in the verse (Esther 3:6) \"And it was contemptible in his eyes to lay his hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him Mordecai's <strong>nationality</strong>\" (not tribe).</p>\n\n<p>I also note the verse in Jeremiah (34:9) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לְ֠שַׁלַּח אִ֣ישׁ אֶת־עַבְדּ֞וֹ וְאִ֧ישׁ אֶת־שִׁפְחָת֛וֹ הָֽעִבְרִ֥י\n  וְהָֽעִבְרִיָּ֖ה חָפְשִׁ֑ים לְבִלְתִּ֧י עֲבָד־בָּ֛ם בִּיהוּדִ֥י\n  אָחִ֖יהוּ אִֽישׁ</p>\n  \n  <p>\"That every man should set his manservant, and every man his\n  maidservant, the <strong>Hebrew</strong> male and <strong>Hebrew</strong> female, free, that\n  none should hold his <strong>Jewish</strong> (\"Yehudi\") brother as a slave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to indicate, that all children of Israel are referred to as \"Yehudim\".</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 13a</a>) states that the word Jew is synonymous with those deny idolatry, hence this refers to all Yehudim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not Jewish nor do I have any formal training in anything.</p>\n<p>In addition to the important comment about the promise that the scepter would not depart from Judah made above by @rosends I would point to <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16155/showrashi/true#v4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's commentary on Hosea 1:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Lord said to him: Name him Jezreel, for, in a short time, I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and I will terminate the kingdom of the house of Israel.</p>\n<p>וַיֹּ֚אמֶר ה֙ אֵלָ֔יו קְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ יִזְרְעֶ֑אל כִּֽי־ע֣וֹד מְעַ֗ט וּפָ֨קַדְתִּ֜י אֶת־דְּמֵ֚י יִזְרְעֶאל֙ עַל־בֵּ֣ית יֵה֔וּא וְהִ֨שְׁבַּתִּ֔י מַמְלְכ֖וּת בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵֽל:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the blood of Jezreel: To be understood according to its Aramaic translation: the blood of the house of Ahab, whom Jehu slew in Jezreel because they worshipped Baal, and he and his sons went afterwards and worshipped pagan deities; therefore, I account for them the blood of the house of Ahab as innocent blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why should a kashrus certification agency change their standards?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Today I learned that the Oasis Mediterranean Foods company (located in Toledo, OH) has lost their <em>hechsher</em> on stuffed grape leaves.  Formerly the entire product line was certified by Star-K, so I called Star-K's <em>kashrus</em> hotline to inquire about the reasons for the change, and whether the rest of the product line was still kosher.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to the rabbi in charge of that region, and he informed me that Star-K had changed their policy with regards to <em>bishul yisrael</em>. Essentially the company had not changed anything in terms of how they prepare the food, but the certification agency became more <em>machmir</em>. (This was his own description of the change, by the way, not just my interpretation.)  He also confirmed that this change only applied to the grape leaves, not to their stuffed cabbage, hummus, fattoush, or other products, all of which are still certified.</p>\n\n<p>I have a hard time understanding the logic behind this. If the grape leaves were kosher six weeks ago, and nothing has changed in the production system, and all the rest of their products are still kosher, what is the logic behind removing the <em>hechsher</em> on the grape leaves now?</p>\n\n<p>More generally, what is the logic underlying any \"policy change\" or \"standards change\" by a kashrus certification agency?  If the underlying halacha hasn't changed, and the facts on the ground haven't changed, why should something be kosher one week and not kosher the next?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Kashrus is a business where the certifier has to balance between the companies and consumers. The certifier determines whether consumers are looking for a higher or lower standard relative to the income they make from the certified company. Most likely the certifier determined that the loss of certifying this company is less than the gain of consumers that will trust and use the Hashgacha. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Without knowing any context or the underlying reasoning behind the policy change, it's difficult to know why the standard was changed. Certainly it is possible that politics and/or customer satisfaction played a role, for better or for worse. It is also quite possible that halachic decisors genuinely changed there view independently. There is no rule that a <em>posek</em> cannot change his mind. Indeed one would expect that fallible humans who are intellectually honest do change their minds from time to time, both toward more stringent positions, as well as to more lenient ones.</p>\n\n\n",

The same question would apply to any \"song\" such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Song of the well (Num. 21:17-18)</li>\n<li><em>Ha'azinu</em> (Deut. 32:1-43)</li>\n<li>Song of Devorah (Judges 5)</li>\n<li>Song of Chanah (I Sam. 2)</li>\n<li>Song of David (II Sam. 32)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>These songs were not sung to the tune of te'amim (trope is Yiddish, so let's bring it all back to Hebrew so that all Jews can feel included :D, or use the English word of Cantillation)</p>\n\n<p>While there are varying beliefs on how/when the Biblical books were written, i think most people would agree that the Prophetic books were not written before the actual events. So in other words, when Devorah sang her song, it was written down AFTER it was already a song. Therefore it would be a stretch to have the song's development be limited to te'amim.</p>\n\n<p>The same is with the song of the sea by Miryam. Even the strictest believers to the Rambam's 13 principles of faith would say that Moshe received the Torah at Sinai. Which means that since Miryam sung her song at the sea before they reached Mount Sinai, her song also existed as a musical piece before Moshe wrote down the Torah, and therefore it would be unlikely that it was sung according to the te'amim.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Dawid's psalms, they were often designed to be played with musical instruments, and to be sung by groups of people. Since te'amim are not played with musical instruments, and are not done with groups of people, it makes the most sense that the psalms were not sung according to the te'amim.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since the majority of the readers here are of Ashkenazi origin, a few notes will have to be made.</p>\n\n<p>The Ashkenazim are unique in having a very long tradition of having all of their te'amim be musical. The rest of the Jewish world did not have this development until very recently. For the rest of the Jewish world, most of the te'amim symbols have no musical value, they only serve as grammatical indicators for readers. <a href=\"http://%20It%20is%20notable%20that%20the%20Yemenites%20have%20only%20eight%20disjunctive%20motifs,%20thus%20clearly%20reflecting%20the%20Babylonian%20notation.%20The%20same%20is%20true%20of%20the%20Karaite%20mode%20for%20the%20haftarah;%20while%20in%20the%20Sephardi%20haftarah%20modes%20different%20disjunctives%20often%20have%20the%20same%20or%20closely%20similar%20motifs,%20reducing%20the%20total%20number%20of%20effective%20motifs%20to%20something%20like%20the%20same%20number.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Yemenites to this day have only 8 musical motifs for their entire cantillation system.</a> <a href=\"http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/Liturgy/Cantillation.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Karaites also don't have a musical tradition for all the te'amim til this very day.</a></p>\n\n<p>In the 14th century it was noted by Simon Duran in his book Magen Avot: \"For the teren chutrin the same motive is used for the tevir, except that it is considerably lengethened, but we know no musical difference between the two...we [also] know no difference in the melody of the revia, qadma, azla, gershayim/shnei gereshin, and zaqeif gadol.\"</p>\n\n<p>Even into the 1500s it was noted by the scholar Elias Levitas in his book <a href=\"http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b386304;view=1up;seq=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tuv Te'am</a> that only the Ashkenazim had musical motifs for all the te'amim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZUI75.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZUI75.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>Image from Idehlson's Thesaurus of Oriental Hebrew Melodies</p>\n\n<p>Since it's most likely that most of the te'amim were not originally musical, nor were ever intended to be musical, it would stand to reason that ancient Biblical songs would not be based on a mostly non musical system.</p>\n\n\n",

(I.e., he doesn't need to be home at the time someone else in his home lights.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>many rule that if a minyan (quorum of ten men for prayer) for afternoon or evening services is held at the public menorah ceremony, then the place would be considered like a synagogue, and one would be able to light with the blessings.</p>\n\n<p>Torat ha-Moadim 7:15; Yalkut Yosef Moadim, p. 204; Chikrei Minhagim, vol. 1, p. 205 (original edition).</p>\n\n<p>Others, however, point out that the primary reason for lighting the menorah in the synagogue is in order to publicize the miracle of Chanukah. Accordingly, the same reasoning should apply to an even greater extent to lighting the menorah in a public place like the mall or city square. And the same argument can be made about many of the other reasons listed above. It is for this reason that blessings are recited at the vast majority of public menorah lightings, even outside of the synagogue.</p>\n\n<p>See Responsa Az Nidabru 5:37, 6:75 and 11:32; Yalkut Yosef, Chanukah 671:10, quoting Rabbi Ovadia Yosef; Yad Natan 2:25; Mishneh Sachir 202; Beit Mordechai 41; Rabbi Yosef Heller, Haorot u-Beurim 721; Netivot bi-Sedeh ha-Shlichut 1:13.</p>\n\n\n",

Hellenism believed in a religious \"pluralism\" antithetical to the Jewish claim of one G-d, and persecuted the Jews for their religious chauvinism (see Maharal, <em>Ner Mitzvah</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, after close to two millennia exiled among the nations, it is perhaps no surprise that many customs appear to have infiltrated into the Jewish mimetic tradition. Perhaps this is most marked with regard to the festive practices associated with the pagan-to-Christian holidays, particularly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saturnalia</a>/Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, among these practices appear to be the (perhaps commercially-initiated) sending of Chanuka cards, giving of <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hanukkah-gifts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chanuka presents</a>, <a href=\"https://www.foiledagainchocolate.com/blog/why-chocolate-coins-st-nicholas-day\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">giving of foil-wrapped chocolate \"gelt\" to children</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.medievalists.net/2012/12/20/seven-medieval-christmas-traditions/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gambling</a>, particularly with <a href=\"http://folkhistory.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-teetotum.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dreidels</a>.

In his case, R. Nissim writes that Abraham was not allowed to tell his wife Sarah his prophecy that she would give birth to a son (which is why the angels came to inform of this even though God already told it to Abraham). In that case, Abraham was not allowed to reveal the information to his wife even though she was a prophetess in her own right.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What should one do if the shamash burns away before the other candles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One important reason to keep a shamash candle burning in a hanukkiah is because Hanukkah candles are not supposed to be used except for fufilling the mitzvah.  The shamash candle allows one to use its light for other purposes like reading or finding ones way in a dark room.</p>\n\n<p>This works for a while after the candles are lit, but some hanukkiot (menorahs) have a shamash holder that causes that candle to go out sooner than the others or a shamash could burn faster than the other candles just from the random variation in wax volume or flame size.  In this case, when a shamash is burned down and out, I think you should not use remaining candles for any mundane purpose.</p>\n\n<p>What practical steps should one take if they find themselves in this situation?  I can imagine:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Blowing out the other candles if the minimum thirty minutes have passed and it is not Shabbat.</p></li>\n<li><p>Replacing that original shamash with another shamash.</p></li>\n<li><p>Turning on the electric lights in the room so that the remaining candles are only used for the mitzvah.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What have you read or been taught that is relevant to this situation?  What would be acceptable ways to handle it?  Are there other ways that I have not thought of?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>If half an hour has passed since you lit the candles (assuming you didn't light early) then you <strong>no longer need a Shamash. You can even extinguish the candles</strong> at that point.</p>\n\n<p>This is explicit in the Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_38.html#HtmpReportNum0002_L2\">סימן תרעב - זמן הדלקת נר חנכה</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הִלְכָּךְ צָרִיךְ לִתֵּן בָּהּ שֶׁמֶן כְּזֶה הַשִּׁעוּר, וְאִם נָתַן בָּהּ יוֹתֵר יָכוֹל  לְכַבּוֹתָהּ לְאַחַר שֶׁעָבַר זֶה הַזְּמַן, וְכֵן יָכוֹל לְהִשְׁתַּמֵּשׁ לְאוֹרָהּ לְאַחַר זֶה הַזְּמַן‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That said, the Be'er Heitev (ibid) brings some opinions that one should not extinguish them, nor derive benefit from them (after relighting them or other uses) - even if they extinguished by themselves. </p>\n\n<p>The reason being that they were set aside for a Mitzva.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>באר היטב</strong>  (ג) <strong>לכבותה</strong>. והב''ח כתב שלא לכבותה ואף אם נכבה מעצמה אסור להנות מהם אף שדלק חצי שעה כיון שהוקצה למצוה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Turning on the electric lights in the room so that the remaining candles are only used for the Mitzvah seems like the sensible alternative.

Such as: \"...who opens the eyes of the blind.\" Or \"...who frees the captive.\" I've always thought about personally thanking G-d (for example) for giving me sight or giving me freedom, respectively. But maybe I should take it more literal, and thank G-d for giving people sight, freeing the captives, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Should I take a more personal or literal approach to the meaning of these prayers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One of the purposes of prayer is to thank and acknowledge G-d as the source or \"wellspring\" of everything. As a matter of fact, the word בְרָכָה(blessing) is related to the word בְרֵכָה meaning \"spring\". See <a href=\"http://www.jewishpathways.com/files/What_is_a_Bracha$.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for this and more explanations.</p>\n\n<p>The phrasing in most <em>birkot hashachar</em> uses a verb such as מלביש ערומים - \"clothing the naked\". While it is true that מלביש is the 3rd person form of the verb לבש, it is also common in Hebrew that such verb forms are used as nouns or gerunds meaning \"the one who clothes the naked.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when reciting such blessings, don't focus on the format of the verb being 3rd person, not is it meant to be personal, either, in these cases. But, rather, focus that G-d is the source of this gift for all mankind, in a general term.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm pointing out is that there are multiple aspects to prayer other than viewing things from a personal stance.</p>\n\n<p>If you really want to make it \"personal\", using the example, above, imagine a world where everyone roamed around naked because G-d never thought of clothing. (Yes, that did happen in the Garden of Eden, and we saw how \"well\" that idea worked out.) I won't delve into your own thoughts about whether you would or wouldn't mind seeing others nude, but, I think you'd agree that eventually, you would get cold, at the least.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I located <a href=\"http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/brachot/brachotpreface.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this great OU article</a> that deals with the general discussion / purpose of all brachot, not necessarily <em>Birkot Hashachar</em>. In the middle of the article, he asks the question, why the beginning of the bracha phrasing I sin 2nd person (\"Adonai\" - MY lord) and then it quickly switches to 3rd person (Elokeinu - OUR G-d)?</p>\n\n<p>I am excerpting a section that I believe relates to your question since your issue seems to wonder about the 3rd person vs. \"me\" \"conflict\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every time that a Jew utters a blessing, he does so out of a sense of\n  gratitude which takes account of the role that God plays in his life.\n  When he awakens in the morning he thanks God for his renewed health\n  and vigor. Before he retires at night, he thanks God for the day's\n  energy and requests a gentle night's sleep. When faced with a piece of\n  bread, fruit, meat, or a drink, the gratitude he experiences is one\n  which contains a sense of closeness to God. But that sense is always\n  ephemeral. It cannot last and it quickly transforms into an awareness\n  of God as the powerful Omnipotent Being whose majesty makes all humans\n  feel puny and insignificant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Cutting Chanukah Candles\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know someone who teaches a weekly Kiruv and Hebrew class and wants to light a menorah before the class, to show them how. However, this class only lasts about and hour long, so is it permissable to cut Chanukah candles so they won't burn for quite as long?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(If the Chanuka menorah is being lit in the daytime, it should not be lit with a bracha.)\n(Shulchan Aruch 672/1) </p>\n\n<p>If it will be lit in the evening, from a half hour before tzeit hakochavim (night fall) until after nightfall, it must be lit for 1/2 hour. (Shulchan Aruch siman 672/se'if 2.) After 1/2 hr, it may be extinguished, (ibid, see also Mishneh Berura, sub-seif 7, the one lighting should have in mind when he lights that he will extinguish it after 1/2 hour.)</p>\n\n<p>As for the kiruv factor, it would be necessary to announce at the lighting that \"we are lighting for the minimum of half hour\" so that people understand. (See Mishnah Berura, 672/sub-se'if 8, based on Magen Avraham and Eliya Raba, quoting the Maharshal.)</p>\n\n<p>If the candles are cut and they cannot last for the entire half hour, then the lighting is improper and berachot should not be said. (Mishneh Berura 675/sub-se'if 8, based on the Chemed Moshe; however the Pri Chadash allows one to add oil after the blessing is made.) In addition, it should be kept in mind that the more candles, the more heat. So even if the candles are cut to the length that one candle would stay lit for 1/2 hour, three or more candles burning in proximity will probably not last for the entire 30 minutes. </p>\n\n<p>At least one Chanuka candle (not including the shamash) must be long enough to last for the entire 30 minutes, under the conditions.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam (brought in the first Biur Halacha on Siman 672), the time for lighting is a bit more than 1/2 hour, and must specifically be lit from the time that the sun goes below the horizon until 30+ minutes afterward, which he identifies as \"the time that feet are finished from the street/market.\" (This to allow pirsumei Nissa (publicizing the miracle to those who are still walking outside.) If one misses that very short time period, he would not be permitted to light. To my knowledge, that is not the Halacha, even among the Sefardim, who normally follow the Rambam. Rav Yosef Karo clearly states that these times are \"lechatchila\" not \"b'dieved.\" He adds, \"if someone is busy/overwhelmed and is concerned that he will not be able to light once sunset arrives, he may light up to 1 1/4 \"relative hours\" (here, c 52min) before sunset! There might be a case to apply this rule is the class is taking place only from say 45 minutes before sunset until shortly after sunset. (Mishneh Berura. sub-se'if 2). The Mishneh Berura (672/3) allows one to make the berachot in that situation.</p>\n\n<p>The Rema, based on the Tur, who quotes Baalei Tosafot, states (gloss on 672/2)  that we (at least B'nei Ashkenaz) are not concerned with the standard of \"the time the feet are finished,etc,\" since by the time of the Rema, et al, the custom was that we lit inside the homes, not at the doorway. Therefore the pirsumei Nissa is done for the household not for those in the marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly we should prefer to light at the correct time, and one should do next to nothing (including learn Torah, eat, etc MB 672/ss10) before lighting (so as not to get caught up and miss the time) but if \"things happen,\" and one did not reach home until late, he may light all night (SA 672/2) until [half hour before] dawn (MB 672/ss 11) with berachot (Pri Chadash, Magen Avraham) preferably with the household awake. If they are \"unwakeable,\" the Chemed Moshe holds that one should light anyway, with a beracha,  since a single person (who has no guests) would light alone anyway. (Sha'ar Tziyon, 17)</p>\n\n\n",

Though, when asked, they haven't been able to really explain why other than that \"I heard this\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm open to reading some opinions from notable rabbis or <em>poskim</em> that explain why it's absolutely forbidden or permitted but not recommended, with an explanation of their reasoning. This assumes that it's fine to use a smart phone, altogether. Just not for davening from it. Are there any such opinions?</p>\n\n<p>I can't quite see the problem, but, then again, my smart phone may be making me dumber than I think I am :-)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Before discussing praying on a smart phone, there is the question of even having it enter the synagogue. Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, R. Yitzhak Yosef (the son of R. Ovadia Yosef), considers some problems related to the subject in his <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> (O\"H 151:29):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שיש לו מכשיר טלפון נייד [פלאפון] צריך לכבותו קודם שיכנס לבית הכנסת, כדי שלא יצלצל באמצע התפלה, ויגרום לביטול כוונת המתפללים. [וגם לא ישאירו במצב של רטיטה, כיון שהדבר יפריע לו עצמו לכוין בתפלה]. ומן הראוי שהגבאים שומרי משמרת הקודש יעירו לנכנסים לבית הכנסת עם פלאפון פתוח, שיכבוהו עם כניסתם לבית הכנסת. [כן הוא בספר משנת יוסף חלק ב' (סימן כז). ואם מותר להתפלל עם פלאפון החגור במתניו, יש שכתבו שהדבר תלוי אם המנהג כיום לפני הנשיאים [המלך] עם פלאפון חגור במתניו, שאם אין נוהגים לעמוד כך בפני הנשיאים, אז גם בתפלת שמונה עשרה אין להתפלל כך. ובפרט שבבתי התפילה של הגויים אין מרשים להכנס לשם עם פלאפון תלוי במתניו].</p>\n  \n  <p>Anyone who has a mobile phone must turn it off before entering the synagogue, so that it does not ring in the middle of the prayer, which would cause the worshipers to void their intention. [And they will also not leave in a state of trembling, since the thing itself will interfere in directing one's prayer]. It is fitting that the <em>gabbaim</em>, who guard the sanctity of the synagogue, alert those who enter the synagogue with an open cell phone, and have them closed at the entrance of the synagogue. As brought down in the book <em>Mishnat Yosef</em> 2:27. Regarding whether one is permitted to pray with a cell phone tied to his waistcoat, some say that this depends on whether the custom of today comports with standing before the presidents [like that of a king] with a cell phone wearing his waistcoat. In other words, if it is not the custom to stand like this before presidents, then so too one should not pray the <em>amidah</em> in this way. Particularly, in the prayer houses of the gentiles, it is not permitted to enter there with a cell phone hanging on his waist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to R. Yosef, some of the issues with having a smart phone in a synagogue involve:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Disturbing the prayers of others </li>\n<li>Impeding one's <em>kavvanah</em> during prayer</li>\n<li>Complying with the decorum of standing before a king</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>From the language of the <em>halakha</em>, however, it seems R. Yosef is only thinking about wearing a cell phone to the synagogue, not praying from it. Additionally, R. Yosef's ruling also came in the early era of cell phones, before their current ubiquity and multi-functionality.  </p>\n\n<p>Directly answering the question of praying from a smart phone, R. Hillel Meirs <a href=\"https://www.hidabroot.org/question/169600\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכתחילה אין להתפלל או לברך ברכת המזון מתוך פלאפון היות ואת עלולה לקבל באותו זמן שיחה שתסיח את דעתך מהתפילה, וכן אנשים עלולים לחשוד שאת מתעסקת בפלאפון בזמן התפילה. ומכל מקום אם אין לך סידור, ואת לא יודעת בעל פה את נוסח התפילה או ברכת המזון, בודאי שאת יכולה להתפלל או לברך מתוך הפלאפון. ויש להכניס את הפלאפון למצב טיסה כדי למנוע הסחות דעת (וע\"ע בשו\"ת אשר חנן חלק ג' סימן ז).</p>\n  \n  <p>One should not, from the outset, pray or recite Birkat Hamazon from a cell phone because you might get a call at the same time that distracts you from prayer. People might also suspect that you are doing other things on the cell phone while praying. But if you do not have a siddur, and you do not know by heart the wording of the prayer or Birkat Hamazon, surely you can pray or bless from the cell phone. In that case, the cell phone should be put into Airplane Mode to avoid distractions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This answer, in my opinion, shows more familiarity with smart phones than the first ruling. Even if the phone is on silent, the notification of a caller would unnecessarily distract someone in the middle of their prayer - such as by leaving the text of the siddur and seeing the caller displayed. This is why the rabbi suggests putting your phone on airplane mode, which would disable the phone from calls, texts, and other potential distractions. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the rabbi raises the potential <em>marit ayin</em> situation of praying with a smart phone. Unlike a printed siddur, you can turn to other apps and messages with your phone, a option the rabbi seems to think might leave a negative impression with other congregants. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, another contemporary authority, written by Dr. R. Avraham Lipshitz, goes over the halakhic sources that problematize praying with a smart phone. In addition to reasons already mentioned, he brings up the talmudic discussion of carrying important objects during prayer. This is another halakhic difference between a siddur and a smart phone, as he <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/toshba/mechkar/lifshitz-tfila.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגמרא אוסרת להחזיק ביד בעת התפילה חפצים שונים, שהחזקתם עלולה להטריד\n  את דעת המתפלל בחששו לקדושתם של חפצים אלו או להפסד ממון אם חלילה יפלו. \n   יש שאסרו בשל החשש להיסח הדעת אחיזתו של כל חפץ שהוא. בתנאים מסויימים\n  ולשיטה מסויימת יחוייב המחזיק בחפצים כאלו לחזור ולהתפלל שוב. יוצא מכלל\n  כל החפצים הוא הלולב, שאחיזתו הותרה בגמרא כיון שיש בכך מצוה. הוא הדין\n  שמותר להחזיק סידור בזמן התפילה. הסידור האלקטרוני הוא חפץ יקר, שאם יפול\n  ייגרם הפסד ממוני רב, ולכן חלוק הוא מהסדור הרגיל. ולכן אסור להתפלל\n  מתוכו.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara forbids holding objects during prayer, which may be of concern to the person praying. The worshiper's concern about the sanctity of these objects or the loss of money if, heaven forbid, they fall. There are those who have forbidden, because of fear of distraction, holding any object. Under certain conditions and in a particular way, the holder of such objects will be required to return and pray again. An exception to these objects is the lulav, in which holding it was permitted in the Gemara because it is a mitzva.\n  The same is true for holding a prayer book. The electronic siddur is in an expensive object, and if it falls there will be a great financial loss, and therefore there is a difference between holding a phone and a regular siddur. Therefore it is forbidden to pray from within a phone. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And\n  they asked further: Why do we have to pray by mouthing words, is it\n  not so that G-d knows all our thoughts and should it not be enough\n  that we think those thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are great questions, and I can't quite begin to answer any of them, myself. Has anyone rav or gadol answered any of them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In answer to your last question: \nRav Shamshon Raphael Hirsch, in his commentary on Bereishis parshas VaYera chapter 20 verse 7, poses a question, \"How could Chazal have expected millions of people, 3 times a day, to all, in unison, to beseech haShem for 12 things (the middle section of the Amidah) all at once at the same time of day, 3 times a day!\"\nHe contends rather, that Chazal's intention of Tefillos was not to allow the inner thoughts to be expressed. Rather, their intention was to encourage us to internalize certain eternal truths: He explains the etymology of the word \"l'hisPaLeL\" is related to \"PaLeL\" pelilim, judgments. In the reflexive form, it would mean \"to cause oneself to be able to make judgments\" about haShem. </p>\n\n<p>And so, Chazal decided that certain things need to be repeated once a year, or three times per year or every Shabbos, and some should be repeated even 3 times a day. After we have internalized that haShem is Chonein haDaas, Goel Yisrael, Rofey Cholim, etc, by Tefillah, then we will be aware whenever we need to throughout the day that we are able to do \"Bakashah\" to beseech His help.</p>\n\n<p>We see a similar idea, when discussing minimal requirements of Kavana(concentration), the Tur puts an emphasis on the blessing-ending of each bracha, which is a statement of fact [\"Blessed are You, HaShem, the One Who blesses the years.\"] as opposed to the body of the bracha, which is worded like a public request [\"Bless us, haShem, this year...\"]. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, he emphasizes the internalizing part of Tefillah over the Requesting side of davening.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>People are inherently dialectic. We are complex beings that could look at the world different ways. And sometimes those ways give what seem to be conflicting answers, and yet each answer is true. For example, the impersonal philosopher's G-d, the view of G-d we are working from when we discuss Infinity, Perfection, Total Unity, etc... Then there is the very Personal G-d we find in Tanakh, Who describes Himself as angry, feeling regret, etc... And even though we know they are idioms, metaphorically used, this is still a call to relate to Hashem as a Him, not as the unfathomable, all-too-beyond-us, Infinite (Ein Sof).</p>\n\n<p>Rav JB Soloveitchik gives an understanding that dovetails well with R' Hirsch's. (See R Yisroel Meir Vogel's answer.) He explains that the essence of tefillah is to change the self, also by noting the \"hitpa'el\", reflexive, conjugation for \"hispalel\".</p>\n\n<p>What was best for the pre-prayer me may not be the same as for the post-prayer me, and therefore prayer could change the outcome.</p>\n\n<p>However, exploring how requests might work despite Hashem always doing what's best for everyone involved either way is different than exploring why we daven and what we're thinking about when we make those requests.</p>\n\n<p>The question of why daven is framed in terms of the Philosophical G-d -- expecting results doesn't fit that way of viewing the Divine.</p>\n\n<p>How to daven, however, is specifically about the Personal G-d. With whom I can have a complex relationship that could be likened to that from (1) lover to Beloved -- Shir haShirim style, (2) parent to Father, or (3) subject to King. As the poet put it, \"יְדִיד נֶפֶשׁ אָב הָרַחֲמָן, מְשֹׁךְ עַבְדָּךְ אֶל רְצוֹנָךְ -- Beloved of the soul, (2) empathetic Father, (3) draw Your servant toward Your Will...\"</p>\n\n<p>(1) Beloved: I have little to say about praying to G-d as Beloved. Not because there is nothing to be said, but because I can only write about what I know. At my stage of spiritual development, relating to \"Avinu Malkeinu -- Our Father, our King\" is challenge enough.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Parent: When I am having a hard time, I talk to my parents. Not because I think they can necessarily help, but because turning to one's support system in time of need is a natural part of a relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to Hashem is an end in itself, not a means to get what I want. (This last point is a major theme in R' Soloveitchik's writings on prayer.) It I happen to thereby be changed in a way that does mean that whatever kept me from getting what I wanted is no longer true, great. But that's a side effect, not the point.</p>\n\n<p>(3) King: Well, as a 21st cent American, the notion of King doesn't quite speak to me viscerally either. But I have worked in a large corporation, and dealt with a CEO whose decisions impact 10s of thousands, something that involves a little fear / awe of his power over my fate/ so I modernized the imagery to that.</p>\n\n<p>The CEO's assistant provides a desired itinerary for the meeting, but it's up to me to provide the specific substance. But Hashem and I are the active partners in BMBW LLP (Better Me, Better World), and we both want the same thing -- more good in the world in general, and in my corner of it in particular. Therefore, when I ask for health, it is more \"wouldn't it be great if You could\", and not \"why haven't you yet, please...\" Back in the work metaphor, \"the employees and customers still need that widget, any chance we can provide it yet\"?</p>\n\n<p>And like image of Hashem-as-Father, who knows, He might decide ... \"Okay, now that you spent enough time reminding yourself that you need Me to get it, giving it to you won't inflate your ego,won't lead you to take it for granted, it would further motivate you to use it as it needs to be used, or something else.\" But even if not, my job is the meeting with the CEO and to spend time discussing our joint concern.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Chassam Sofer <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41434&st=&pgnum=72&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in his drashos chelk 3 p. 52</a> says praying is a chok, a mitzvah we can't understand, precisely for some of the reasons you mentioned in the name of the Maharal. \nHe says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>logically it is not proper to request anything from Hashem and to bother Him saying 'give give!' as if Hashem doesn't know our needs and isn't watching out for our best and somehow we know better than Him.

Lately, comparisons are being drawn between possibly refusing Syrian Muslim refugees, or Muslims in general, entry into the United States with the genocide that was committed upon the Jewish people during World War II by the Nazis.</p>\n\n<p>This term, 'genocide', actually originated in 1944 during United Nations discussions about what happened to the Jewish people during the Holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>It means the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political or cultural group. Genocide is considered a crime against all of humanity. There is no justification or defense for committing genocide.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the Syrian refugees, at least some of them are fleeing ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). ISIS is, in fact, committing genocide against then Yazidi people. Similarly, the Turkish Muslims committed genocide against the Armenian people in 1915 and the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Cambodian people in the killing fields during the mid 1970's.</p>\n\n<p>We are commanded to erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Like it says in Devarim 25:17-19, \"Remember what Amalek did to you, on the road in your departure from Egypt.That your apathetic ones (קרך) and all the underprivileged (כל-הנחשלים) amongst you trailed behind you. And you were weary (from thirst) and tired. And he didn't fear G-d. And when it will be, when the L-rd, your G-d will give you rest from all your local troubles in the land that the L-rd, your G-d gives to you as an inheritance to possess, you will erase the memory of Amalek from under the heavens. Do not forget.\"</p>\n\n<p>And this commandment is based upon Shemot, chapter 17, which recounts the test of Massah and Merivah, when the Jewish people had no water to drink in the desert. And they quarreled with Moshe and doubted whether G-d was with them and whether Moshe had misled them.</p>\n\n<p>With G-d's help, Moshe was able to provide them with water to drink. And on the heels of this, Amalek attacked the weak and sick who were straggling behind the main camp, outside of the protective clouds of glory.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah relates the coming of Moshiach with, among other things, winning the war with Amalek. (Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Melachim, 5:5, 11:4, Aruch HaShulchan HaAtid, Halachot Shonot, Siman 71, Tzeida l'Derech, Ma'amar 5, K'lal Shelishi, Chapter 4, Semag (Sefer Mitzvot Gadolot), Mitzvot Lo Ta'aseh 226, Mitzvot Aseh 116)</p>\n\n<p>This is generally considered to be part of the wars that Moshiach must fight and win (Shemot 17:16).</p>\n\n<p>But at the same time we are told that we are to choose life and not the opposite of life. (Devarim 30:15-20)</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we are commanded not to take vengeance (Semag, Lo Ta'aseh 11, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot De'ot, 7:7). The Semag, in particular says this trait of seeking vengeance is exceedingly bad.</p>\n\n<p>Does erasing the memory of Amalek mean we are commanded to commit genocide?</p>\n\n<p>If not, what does it mean that we are supposed to do?</p>\n\n<p>Please keep in mind that the halachic aspect of this discussion requires that this must be understood according to the plain meaning of this subject.</p>\n\n<p>In dealing with this question, it is important to keep a few points in mind.</p>\n\n<p>1) The commandment itself doesn't say simply, 'Amalek attacked us and we are to wipe them out'. It makes a point of bringing the whole story of how we were dieing of thirst. (In the best of conditions, a human being cannot survive without water more than about 3 days.) And the weakest among us were straggling behind the group in a very vulnerable position. Only then did Amalek attack the weak and vulnerable people. They didn't go after the strong.</p>\n\n<p>2) The mitzvah does not say wipe out Amalek. It says wipe out the 'memory of Amalek'.</p>\n\n<p>3) Even in the example of Moshe and Yehoshuah, it emphasizes that they did not wipe out everyone from Amalek. Yehoshuah only killed those necessary to stop the action. And in the commentaries it emphasizes that this was done at the specific command of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>4) This exact same behavior is detailed in regard to David HaMelech's war with Amalek through his General Yoav ben Tzaruyia as found in Sefer Yalkut HaMakiri on Tehillim, Chapter 18, sief 61. This means that David HaMelech, at least on the face of it, did exactly the same thing that Shaul HaMelech did. Clearly, something else must have happened that was different.</p>\n\n<p>A link to this can be seen here: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32636&st=&pgnum=132\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32636&st=&pgnum=132</a></p>\n\n<p>5) The Meiri on Sotah gives an explanation for this type of action. He says that for non-Jews, when a woman marries out to a different nation, both she and the offspring are no longer associated with her fathers nation. So in order to fall into the category of Amalek, the lineage would have to be preserved father to son in a continuous chain. The Meiri takes that idea a step further in the context of the mixing of the generations by Sennacherib and suggests that by his time (the time of the Meiri) the nation of Amalek had ceased to exist altogether. The citation begins with the words: \"שבעה עממין\"</p>\n\n<p>A link can be seen at: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40767&st=&pgnum=115\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40767&st=&pgnum=115</a></p>\n\n<p>6) We are told explicitly that whatever this 'war with Amalek' is for G-d, it exists in each and every generation. (מדור דור)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As seen in Rambam <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, there is a peace process even when dealing with Amalek and the other seven nations. </p>\n\n<p>\"A war is never waged against anyone before peace is offered. This applies both to an obligatory war and to a permitted war, as it is written “when you get near a city to wage war against it, you must offer peace” (Deut. 20:10). If they agree and accept upon themselves the seven mitzvot given to the children of Noah, not a single soul is to be harmed, and they are to pay taxes , as it is written “they will pay taxes and serve you” (Deut. 20:11). If they accepted taxes but not servitude, or servitude and not taxes, we don’t listen to them, until they accepted both. …</p>\n\n<p>However, if either the seven nations or Amalek refuse to accept a peaceful settlement, not one soul of them may be left alive as ibid. 20:15-16 states: 'Do this to all the cities that ... are not the cities of these nations. However, from the cities of these nations,... do not leave a soul alive.' Similarly, in regard to Amalek, Deuteronomy 25:19 states: 'Obliterate the memory of Amalek.'...\"</p>\n\n<p>So we are not simply committing blind genocide, we are killing the people who refuse to accept God's sovereignty and offer of peace.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this type of warfare cannot happen until after Moshiach arrives when the Jewish people have a king. But at that time our tradition tells us all the nation's will recognize and accept God. So their refusal to accept peace and God seems unlikely.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Amalek was the first nation to wage war with Israel after the Exodus. Their animosity towards us will not end unless either we are destroyed or they are. The two people/philosophies are totally irreconcilable.</p>\n\n<p>So really it is a defensive war.</p>\n\n<p>We can see this in our time with the Nazi rulers who were supposedly from Amalek (see video below). Hitler gave greater priority to the trains to Auschwitz than those to his own struggling troops.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqJxpou2gsY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lecture</a> for more on this.</p>\n\n<p>So the answer is yes, though till then we accept converts from them, so we recognize that there are some good ones among them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>yes we are commanded to wipe out Amalek. Practically speaking though this would be challenging as there is no nation we can point to and say they are amalek. Perhaps moshiach will tell usor maybe not. Until then though we still must ask ourselves then why would such a thing be in the Torah? Everything in the Torah is meant to teach us something practically for all times and places. While we may not have a physical war or battles with amalek as a nation we have the daily war with amalek as the yetzer hara. sometimes when we are weak and tired there comes along a justification for why we should do something contrary to the Torah and at that moment we must remember and wipe out this amalek who is attacking us from behind when we are at our most susceptible state with justifications. This is the amalek we must wipe out today.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the most basic tenants of Judaism is mesorah to follow the forefathers customs. There is great discussion in the poskim what to do if one has a custom that is questionably not like halacha-see poskim shvuas-akkdamas) \nIn regard to when one is with a majority that has a different custom, the halacha is one must keep his custom only when it will not be visible to others otherwise there is a problem of lo tisgodidu-not to make different camps.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No there is no need to do so. Once a Jew always a Jew regardless of tradition preferences. As for what customs to follow... customs are traditionally passed on through the father. for a convert though what traditions to follow will be up to him. It is important though that in this journey he or she has a Rabbi that can help him or her decide which ones to keep. For the convert to find a teacher is even more important b/c of this issue. Another thing to know is that when choosing a path in Judaism that means not creating a buffet just on what seems catchy an easy thing to fall into when one doesn't have a set tradition to follow. Typically a convert will follow the customs of the Rabbi who helped him or her prepare for their conversion and if not will at least provide guidance for what they should do.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't know if this was an estimate of the right level of annoyance the next morning, or so that the man who did overdue it would pay a social penalty because someone would eventually notice how often he goes. This legislation was never accepted by the masses, and therefore did not become binding.

Therefore this verse comes, after [the Torah] has enumerated those things that are completely prohibited, commanding in a general way to separate ourselves from excessive material indulgence and to restrict ourselves in sexual intercourse, as the Rabbis say, “Sages ought not to be found with their wives like roosters” [Berakhos 22a], but only engage in sexual relations according to that which is needed to fulfill the mitzvot connected therewith.\"</p>\n\n<p>Those mitzvos being the connecting with another person \"and he shall be attached to his wife and become another person\" (Bereishis 2:24) and procreation (Bereishis 1:28).</p>\n\n<p>Similar to Rav Shimon Shkop's take on the Ramban, that overdoing it is defined by distractions to holiness, we find Rav Moshe Chaim Luzzatto writing in Mesilas Yesharim (ch. 14) writes (bracketed insertion and emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Separation in relation to pleasures, which we spoke of in the previous chapter [where it is given as one of three types of \"separation\"], consists in one’s taking from the world only what is essential to him. This type of Separation encompasses anything which provides pleasure to any one of the senses, whether the pleasure be gained through food, <strong>cohabitation</strong>, clothing, strolls, conversation or similar means, exceptions obtaining only at such times when deriving pleasure through these means is a mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there is a call to refrain from overdoing sex, but the definition of \"overdoing\" is when it gets to the point that you lose sight of bonding to one's spouse, a very contextual and subjective frequency.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This discussion centers around the mishna in avos towards the end of chapter two (either mishna 12 or 17, depending on your print) \"all your deeds should be lishem shomayim\". </p>\n\n<p>Rambam offers two different approaches between his pirush on the mishna and in his shmona perakim, which is echoed in the two different approaches in the shulchan aruch brought in shalom's answer. See there and the sources in Shalom's sources for a better understanding.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the gemara in Bava Basra 16a which praises Avraham for having never concentrated on Sarah's beauty, brought in Rashi on Lech Licha 12 11. This would give credence to the no personal enjoyment approach.</p>\n\n<p>This is all Midas Chasidus though. A possibly  unattainable goal for which the true benefit is gained simply by a different approach to life. There are many examples in the Talmud where a wife's beauty is appreciated for shalom bayis. In fact the seffer chasidim says it is not allowed to marry someone one finds unattractive as he will spend the rest of his life secretly praying for her to die.</p>\n\n<p>So as with all Midas Chasidus, a disclaimer is in order, not to ruin the main mitzvah while chasing chasing the extra credit.

    "content": "# Should one go out of his way to give his wife all the money and gifts she wants?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <em>Garden of Peace</em>, Rabbi Shalom Arush says that a man should give his wife all the money she needs and not worry her about any financial issues you are experiencing.</p>\n\n<p>To me, this seems a bit excessive. What if the wife is selfish and decides to take advantage of her husband?</p>\n\n<p>Is this idea founded in other sources or is it unique to Rabbi Shalom Arush?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think that may have been a bit of an overstatement for emphasis. The Gemara says there is such thing as giving too much charity -- you are not allowed to endanger your own financial security. (And if you do so, you will not be in a position to help anyone else, and will in turn need help from others.) </p>\n\n<p>Thus, someone who spends on his wife until he is in ruin is not, in the long run, helping him or her. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud says a man should \"love his wife as much as himself, and honor her more than himself\"; it also recommends buying her new clothes for the holidays. I've never seen \"blank check\", and that actually runs contrary to the nuts-and-bolts monetary arrangements described in the mishna in Kesubos.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is a healthy relationship with healthy conversations; a good marriage should be able to have conversations about finances. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To add to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/66119\">Shalom's answer</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Avira says (in the name of R' Ami and R' Assi) that a husband should \"honor his wife and children more than what he has\" (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=84b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Chullin</em> 84b</a>). Rashi (ad loc., s.v. \"פחות\") seems to interpret this as meaning one should spend beyond his means to honor his wife. (See R' Chaim Shmuelevitz's discussion of this, cited <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/chulin/insites/ch-dt-084.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam appears to say, however, that while a person should allocate more of his money for spending on his wife and children than would be typical for a person of his means, he should not do so to the extent that he spends beyond his means or overly exerts himself to earn the extra money (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=138\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hil. Dei'os</em> 5:10</a>; see also <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=4&hilchos=22&perek=15&halocha=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hil. Ishus</em> 15:19</a>, that a husband should spend money on his wife to the degree that he is able). </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=76b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sanhedrin</em> 76b</a>) praises a husband who \"loves his wife as himself, and honors her more than himself.\" Rashi (ad loc., s.v. \"והמכבדה\") says that honoring her includes providing her with adornments (e.g. nice clothing and jewelry) beyond what he gets for himself. </p>\n\n<p>Note that, while these sources indicate a husband should go above and beyond in providing for his wife, they do not support the idea that a husband should allow his wife to \"take advantage\" of him or totally destroy their family's finances by demanding an endless supply of luxuries (per the extreme hypothetical case you raised in the OP).</p>\n\n<p>In any case, as R' Chelbo taught, blessing rests on a man's home in the merit of his wife. As Rava advised the people of Mechoza, they would do well honor their wives if they wished to become wealthy (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=59&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Bava M'tzi'a</em> 59a</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

That said, it contains detailed discussions of particular ones, and to what extent they are to be said by a mourner as opposed to someone else. The following are written with respect to mourners.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[If one] entered the shul when the group had finished - even though one has not said <em>Alenu</em> - one can say <em>kadish</em> [<em>yasom</em> after <em>Alenu</em>]. (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46540&st=&pgnum=327&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">44:16</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds to me like this means the late enterer was literally not there for any of <em>t'fila</em>. The footnote implies likewise by citing a conflicting opinion that one may not say <em>kadish</em> unless he had overlapped for [at least] a single <em>pasuk</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But it also says <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46540&st=&pgnum=329\" rel=\"nofollow\">5 paragraphs later</a> that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a mourner who'd davened at the earlier <em>minyan</em> and is in the shul, it is not appropriate for him to say <em>kadish</em> again, unless [people] are likely to suspect his lack of respect for his [deceased] parent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is attributed to <em>Riv'vos Efrayim</em>, which in turn cites <em>Igros Moshe</em>. In this case the person was still around, as opposed to the first case where they had just shown up and presumably hadn't yet said <em>kadish</em> at all.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>kadish d'rabanan</em> there seems to be more of an assumption of the reciter's participation in the <em>d'rasha</em>/<em>talmud</em>/<em>Torah</em> than that for <em>t'fila</em>, as far as your initial question. I didn't see it address the <em>makdish</em>-was-absent-for-learning case (may have missed it). I speculate that the underlying idea is that <em>kadish d'rabanan</em> is intended to juxtapose <em>kidush Hashem</em> with <em>Torah</em> as a <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.49a?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow\">public service</a>, and as such, it is often said by a more inclusive set of people than other instances of <em>kadish</em> - e.g. <em>sh'lichei tzibur</em>, mourners, or <em>m'say'mim</em>, but specifically those who did the act in question.</p>\n\n<p><sub>It also mentions that the child doing <em>mitzvos</em> should have the same or greater effect on the <em>n'shama</em> of the parent than saying <em>kadish</em>.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

Ramban (Nachmanides) writes in the beginning of commentary on the Chumash, that the Genesis story, from the beginning through the Tower of Babel, is a deep secret part of the Torah which cannot be understood from a simple or literal meaning of the words. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מפני שמעשה בראשית – סוד עמוק, אינו מובן מן המקראות, ולא יוודע על בוריו אלא מפי הקבלה עד משה רבינו מפי הגבורה, ויודעיו חייבין להסתיר אותו. לכך אמר רבי יצחק שאין להתחלת התורה צורך ב\"בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא\", והסיפור במה שנברא ביום ראשון ומה נעשה ביום שני ושאר הימים, והאריכות ביצירת אדם וחוה, וחטאם ועונשם, וסיפור גן עדן וגירוש אדם ממנו, כי כל זה לא יובן בינה שלימה מן הכתובים. וכל שכן ספור דור המבול והפלגה, שאין הצורך בהם גדול. ויספיק לאנשי התורה בלעדי הכתובים האלה, ויאמינו בכלל בנזכר להם בעשרת הדברות (שמות כ י): \"כִּי שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים עָשָׂה ה' אֶת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֶת הָאָרֶץ אֶת הַיָּם וְאֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁר בָּם וַיָּנַח בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי\", ותישאר הידיעה ליחידים שבהם הלכה למשה מסיני, עם התורה שבעל פה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rather, Nachmanides undertsands that the simple meaning of the words are only to be parable or metaphor for the consequences of sin. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the geneologies supplied by the Torah, with exact ages and key children from Adam to Noach and Noach to Avram, don't appear poetic or parable-like. And Nachmanides, in his commentary to Genesis 5:4 seems to take these geneological lists at face value. It seems to me, therefore, that there was an Adam and Eve and they are our ancestors, but the details of the story of their creation, sin, and expulsion from Eden are not literal but a parable (at least according to Ramban).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Remedy for Desire for a Married Woman\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>We are all human and sometimes tend towards the evil inclination. At times we successfully fight against the inappropriate feelings, thoughts, actions, etc. At other times we don't do so well. For example, I, a Jewish man, am extremely attracted to a married Jewish women whom I work with (but not in the same office.)</p>\n<p>The reasons for my attraction are numerous and believe it or not, it isn't only about sex appeal. I do not deny that I find her REALLY good looking, but there is a holistic element to my attraction. We communicate so well, we share many common interests, we share personal information (NOT of a sexual nature), she is intelligent and well educated, she loves children, she is a kind-hearted person who expresses empathy towards others, we understand each other's off-center sense of humor. I can go on and on.  She is, however, married to a non-Jewish man by whom she has a young daughter, but she still has some connection with Judaism. Obviously (?) she is not my <em>beshert</em> but in many ways I feel as if she is.</p>\n<p>Now I assure you that I would NEVER act on my yatzer harah, but the desire is so strong at times that it causes me distress and guilt. If she were to get divorced, I'd be hitting on her in an instant. If she felt the same towards me, well Mazel Tov to both of us. That would solve part of the problem although that would not absolve me of my current sinful urges.</p>\n<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>\n<p>So I am wondering, are there any Jewish sources that offer specific actions or prayers to repent for having inappropriate desire for a married woman? In addition, are there any Jewish sources that recommend ways to avoid/suppress the feelings?</p>\n<p>Keep in mind I am not concerned with generalized attraction towards women I come in contact with on a daily basis.

In short, given your situation he would probably recommend not looking at her (and avoiding interacting with her if possible), and engaging in daily sessions of personal prayer in your own words to do teshuvah and ask for Hashem's help in eliminating forbidden desires. Of course, you can also pray to find your bashert, whether or not it is her. In any case, hatzlacha in dealing with this issue and finding your bashert!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Obviously one must make every attempt to overcome any struggle or temptation being faced currently, and try to achieve forgiveness for transgression.</p>\n<p>But if you find yourself trapped within this situation for the unforseeable future, despite all your efforts, then I think you have to consider extricating yourself.</p>\n<p>You ask for sources for repentance, and sources to avoid temptation. A prerequisite to Teshuva is, as the Rishonim point out, <em>Azivat HaChet</em> - removing oneself from the transgression.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean that you drop everything and fling yourself out of the window, a la Joseph from Potifar's wife. Instead, you lay the groundwork, preparing yourself to move. Whether that means asking to transfer departments, or even seeking a new job entirely, that should be your focus. Having the knowledge that the current situation is only temporary will provide you with relief and resolve, even if this transition period lasts a few weeks or even months.</p>\n<p>It's easy for myself, as a dispassionate observer, to dictate this to you.

However, as Dr. Finkelstein rightly points out, the fact that Provence, Avignon, and Carpentras have only this version for all services would indicate that it is very old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The footnote is not available in the excerpt. I was wondering if anyone had any more information on the origins of this Nusach, or how to find more information from the excerpt I found (eg. is there a Siddur of Meir of Rothenburg that I don't know of; who is Dr. Finkelstein?).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Two variants of Shalom Rav was found in the Cairo Geniza. Given the similarities between Cairo and Israeli nusachos, it is assumed to have been the Nusach Eretz Yisrael in the days of the tannaim and Israeli amora'im. Another indication is that Nusach Provence, the berakhah was always \"Shalom Rav\". The Provencial community, which was a true center of Jewish Life and Torah in the days of the rishonim, had a strong tradition of being refugees from the Roman conquest of Israel. So it would seem this is the Nusach Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of a number of cases where Sepharadim follow Nusach Bavel and Ashkenazim find a compromise between <em>Nusach Bavel</em> and <em>Nusach Eretz Yisrael</em>. This is believed to be historically caused by the number of captives from Eretz Yisrael taken back to Italy by the Roman army, whose descendents then go up to Ashkenaz in Charlemagne's day. In fact, the Jews of Luneil had a tradition that they were descendents of the city of Yericho. Luneil is from luna (French: moon) in the same way Yericho would be from <em>yareiach</em> (Hebrew: moon).</p>\n\n<p>The Provencal community ended up joining Ashkenaz. The bulk of Ashkenazic Jewry, though, were invited up from Italy by Charlemagne, who needed an economic backbone for the heart of the Holy Roman Empire. But many of these Italian Jews were also descendents of Israel; many taken back to Rome with the departing armies.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is the preservation of the Israeli \"<em>LeDor vaDor</em>\", using it instead of \"<em>Atah Qadosh</em>\" when saying <em>Qedushah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So it looks like splitting our time between Sim Shalom when this is a <em>tefillah</em> in which <em>duchan</em>ing is allowed and <em>Shalom Rav</em> when it is not is a legacy of how <em>Minhag Ashkenaz</em> was formed. Descendents of Israel and Bavel relocated to the same area, and had to make a common <em>minhag</em> for this community, and the result was a bit of compromise.</p>\n\n<p>This idea about the origins of <em>Minhag</em> and <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> (including these two cases, <em>piyut</em>, and much more) are discussed at length in the writings of Prof.s Agus and Ta-Shma, and others.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the pros and cons of learning online?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My work schedule and growing family (stressed wife) hasn't yet provided an opportunity to go learn in a yeshiva or adult learning at night. Getting more serious about learning two years ago, I was inspired to learn Torah at work instead of being tainted by the music I was listening to. A friend introduced me to R' Yossi Mizrahi of DivineInformation.com which led to TorahAnytime.com etc. Easily hundreds of hours listening to shiurim and have enjoyed every moment! </p>\n\n<p>This learning has inspired me to seek out seforim to fill in leisure time during breaks, traveling, and Shabbat. So titles like Daily Dose, Mesillat Yesharim, Sfas Emes Perkei Avos and many others consume my bookshelf. A speck compared to many contributors on M.Y., I'm sure!</p>\n\n<p>But everything must have its balance in life. Think it was R' M. M. Weiss who said, 'with all the tumah readily available today, Hashem had to balance it with Torah just as available online.' So at what point, if at all, does the majority of ones <strong><em>learning online</em></strong> hinder structure and productivity long term? For the laymen, do forums like M.Y. provided a 'sub' of sorts for the chavrusa experience found in yeshivot? I am one who strives to avoid Facebook ultimately for the tumah and illusion of 'relationship'. From a chavrusa standpoint for a layman, can M.Y. and like sites become a replacement for Facebook, resembling similar concerns? </p>\n\n<p>My goal with this question is to develop a healthy perspective and conviction in Avodat Hashem. Please source and provide 'sufficient' translation if applicable. I am 'crawling' with my Hebrew, B'H! lol. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Online learning is absolutely a valuable experience. The fact of the matter is, you can find the answer to <em>pretty much</em> any question that you have about Judaism online (and if you can't find it, it's always possible to ask here on Mi Yodeya).</p>\n\n<p>I would say there are two main drawbacks to learning exclusively online:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You may not get the <em>complete</em> picture. Most of the resources available online of a <em>halachic</em> nature tend to lean toward giving the bottom line rather than all of the different opinions. This is limiting because the <em>halacha</em> is often more complicated than the bottom line and individual circumstances can make a difference (see <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1734/1713\">Can I consult Mi Yodeya as I would a rabbi?</a>).  This issue is less problematic for <em>hashkafic</em> works like the ones that you mentioned in your question and <em>divrei Torah</em> which do not attempt to inform you on specific <em>halachot</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>A drawback that applies to any kind of online learning (contrasted with <em>chavrusa</em> learning) is that you miss out on the standard learning <em>process</em>.  Banging your ahead on the table and shouting at your <em>chavrusa</em> are practically rights of passage in the observant Jewish world. From an <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/talmudtorah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> that you might find interesting, \"In Jewish practice, Torah study often takes on a ritualized role similar to that of prayer.\" You don't participate in that ritual with online learning like Mi Yodeya.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To conclude, supplementing your learning with online learning opportunities is fantastic! We live in an amazing world where so much Jewish learning is available with the push of a button. I don't know much about what your life is really like, but I would recommend examining it to determine if it is <em>really</em> <strong>so</strong> busy that you don't have any time for more traditional learning opportunities. It could very well be that you actually have more time than you think if you rearrange your schedule. On the other hand, maybe it's true that you really don't have any free time. In that case, keep up the online learning and work towards eventually freeing up some time for some traditional learning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>What I'm stating is my own opinion based on my experience. Others may advise otherwise, and you may have a different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>\"Online\", these days, offers so many options that it is mind boggling. Some ideas, from my perspective:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On line Shiurim</strong> - I can't see any issue with live shiurim taught by a notable rav. If it's done via Skype or web-conferencing, etc. it's great and it's as if you were in the room, esp. if you can converse and ask questions. In some ways, it's better esp. if the shiur is distant from you. Rabbi Reiss in Brooklyn webcasts his shiur each M. Shabbat. It is terrific. So, IMO, if you can use that option, good for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chavruta learning</strong> - If you have a choice, you're better spending time in the Bet Midrash since you have access to sefarim that you or your chevruta may not have at home, and there may be a rav or someone else who can answer a tough question and / or guide you. However, if you really like your chevruta and you're distant, this serves a good purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The other \"stuff\" scattered about the web:</p>\n\n<p>Well, there is a wealth of excellent resources. Hebrewbooks and Sefaria are 2 fantastic web resources. I find stuff that I can't locate that easily in a Bet Midrash. It's nice to have it easily available.</p>\n\n<p>Various rabbis place their shiurim online and there are \"loose\" articles. I subscribe to Rav Mordechai Kamenetzki's \"fax homily\". OK, I have a slight bias in that he lives near me and I know him well. But even if not, his presentation is very interesting, even if I occasionally disagree or don't \"get it\". Point is, that you get a lot of good info this way.</p>\n\n<p>Forums such as M.Y. - Hmmm ... I hate to say anything negative, as I may lose some votes, hahaha. You're a bit new, here. M/Y. is a refreshingly different from many other \"frum\" forums that I've seen, and overall, I have learned a tremendous amount from others, here. I find it either in their direct answers or via the various links posted, here. Granted, you do get some \"shmutz\" every so often. That's inevitable in a forum. But, eventually, if you hang around long enough, I think you'll find the majority to be good worthwhile material and reference, as I have.</p>\n\n<p>I can't really say much for other forums. You have to weight them out and make your own judgments. Keep an open mind.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, on a personal level, I only upgraded to a smart phone about 4 months ago. Yes, it has far more junk than I care for. But, I downloaded an app that includes all of Tanach, Gemarah, etc. During my daily subway commute (which sadly, is getting longer each month!) I read <em>Shnayim Mikra Ve'echad Targum</em>. (reading the wekly Torah portino twoce with Taurgum once). So, I'm occupying my commute with Torah and I don't have to shlep several sefarim with me. I'm a Ba'al Kri'ah (Torah reader) and I have a Tikkun app. Wow!! All these years I schlepped a heavy Tikkun on the subway or would have to print a few sheets, then they get lost or crumpled, etc. No more! So, you can certainly see that there's great online stuff that can be downloaded easily.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, as you've figured, be smart about it, use your judgment. I think you can distinguish the good from the \"dirt\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can't speak to Daf Yomi or to other structured learning programs that just happen to be conducted online. I'm sure there are many good ones. As for Mi.Yodeya, though, I would suggest being really careful about using it as a replacement for a real-life chavrusa, rabbi, and/or mashpia. </p>\n\n<p>Having used this site to get answers to the majority of my (beginner- and intermediate-level) Judaism questions for about four years, I would say the results have been these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I have learned a lot -- <em>a lot</em> -- thanks to a large group of intelligent, knowledgeable, and kind posters here, and their generous contributions of time and attention to my questions.

The 19th Century Hebraist John Lange provides the following.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00JLWKNV4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 36:9</a></strong><br>\n  <sup>9</sup> And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir: <sup>10</sup> These are the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau; Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. <sup>11</sup> And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman [<em>right side</em>, <em>southlander</em>], Omar [Gesenius: <em>eloquent</em>; Fürst: <em>mountain-dweller</em>], Zepho [<em>watch</em>], and <sup>12</sup> Gatam [Gesenius: <em>puny</em>, <em>thin</em>; Fürst: <em>burnt</em>, <em>dry valley</em>] and Kenaz [<em>hunting</em>].

And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath [<em>going down</em>, <em>evening</em>], and Zerah [<em>rising</em>, <em>morning</em>], Shammah [<em>wasting</em>; Fürst: <em>report</em>, <em>call</em>], and Mizzah [Gesenius: <em>fear</em>; Fürst: perhaps <em>joy</em>, <em>rejoicing</em>]: these were the sons of Bashemath, Esau’s wife. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the 18th Century Hebraist, <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0801037360\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wilhelm Gensenius</a>, the better translation of \"עם מלק\" (\"<em>'am malak</em>\") may be, <strong><em>people of the crushed head</em>.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מָלַק</strong> TO BREAK, TO CRUSH (einknicken), Levit. 1:15; 5:8. (Cognate is the root <strong>פָּרַק</strong>, whence this has arisen, the letter <em>r</em> being softened into <em>l</em>, <em>p</em>, and <em>m</em> interchanged. Syr. and Chald. <strong>מלג</strong> <em>vellicavit</em>.) LXX. ἀποκνίζω, <em>to cut off with the nail</em> (abkneipen), contrary to the express words of the Hebrew text, <strong>יַבְדִּיל וְלֹא</strong> Lev. 5:8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>During the First Century of the Current Era, the Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Philo of Alexandria</a> suggested the correlation between Amalek and the serpent as follows.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>. . . that is to say, Amalek; which name, being interpreted, means, <em>the people licking</em>. For he does, of a verity, devour the whole soul, and licks it up, leaving no seed behind, nor anything which can excite virtue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Philo wrote in the First Century, and therefore his source of information appears to stem from interpretations relating to the serpent licking the dust. For example, the serpent licking the dust appears among the prophets of the Hebrew Bible:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah%207%3A17&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Micah 7:17</strong></a> (NASB)<br>\n  <sup>17</sup> <strong><em>They will lick the dust like a serpent</em></strong>,<br>\n  Like reptiles of the earth.<br>\n  They will come trembling out of their fortresses;<br>\n  To the Lord our God they will come in dread<br>\n  And they will be afraid before You.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Amalekites therefore are <strong><em>the people of the crushed head of the serpent</em></strong> as the narrative of Genesis makes this apparent. </p>\n\n<p>For example, when the Israelites escaped Egypt and entered the Promised Land, the Amalekites had “tripped them up.” That is, they attacked the Israelites at their weak spot, or at their hindermost part or “tail,” which was comprised of those who had lagged behind (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2025%3A17&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut 25:17</a>). The Hebrew word for the hindermost part of the body is עָקֵב, which is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the rear echelon of an army (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2049%3A19&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 49:19</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%208%3A13&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joshua 8:13</a>). That is, the rear echelon of an army is their hindermost part. The Amalekites attacked Israel at their hindermost part. The exact same Hebrew word is also found in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203%3A15&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the serpent bites the “hindermost part” of the seed of the woman -- that is, the serpent attacks his heel, since the heel is physiologically the hindermost part of the <em>human</em> body. The moral and spiritual seed of the serpent is therefore the enemy of God. “Amalek” therefore is the enemy of the seed of God (Israel), who “trips up” at the most vulnerable time and opportunity. </p>\n\n<p>In this regard, the Amalekites within the land of Canaan were not the seed of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites or the Jebusites, but of Esau, who was the twin brother of Jacob (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2036%3A12&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 36:12</a>). When Esau was born, his twin brother tried “to trip him up” at birth, and therefore the twin brother was named “Jacob.” Jacob “the heel” was born from the seed of promise through Abraham. “Amalek” therefore is not biological, but moral and spiritual (since Esau and Jacob were born from the same biological parents). Please note that “Jacob” (<strong>יַעֲקֹב</strong>) and “heel” (<strong>עָקֵב</strong>) are therefore related etymologically. That is, the plain and normal meaning of the word יַעֲקֹב “Jacob” is qal imperfect of <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?source=Psalm11918%2Eorg&strongs=H6117&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow\">עָקַב</a></strong>, which means <em>he will heel</em> (and therefore crush).</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the head of the spiritual seed of Amalek (serpent) is crushed by the head of the spiritual seed of the Jacob-heel (Israel). Thus the Amalekites are <strong><em>the people of the crushed head of the serpent</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong>   </p>\n\n<p>Gesenius, Wilhelm, & Tregelles, Samuel P.

    "content": "# Why isn't maakeh in the Tur?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The chapters in <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em></a> generally follows those in <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba'ah_Turim\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Tur</em></a>, with <a href=\"/q/47997\">a couple of exceptions</a> <a href=\"/q/15865\">here and there</a>. One of those exceptions is that <em>SA</em> adds a final chapter, 427, to <em>Choshen Mishpat</em> discuss the rules of <a href=\"/tags/maakeh/info\"><em>maake</em></a> (a required railing around a high walking surface). Indeed, <em>Tur</em> doesn't discuss <em>maake</em> at all, so far as I can tell. This, despite its general coverage of all laws practically applicable nowadays in <a href=\"/tags/chutz-laaretz/info\"><em>chutz laaretz</em></a>. Why not?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I see that <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/08/05/turs-omission-of-maakeh/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>dinonline.org</code></a> discusses this question and mentions two answers but rejects them both as unsatisfactory:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A Rabbi Mazuz (I don't know which one, R. <em>Matzliach</em> or R. <em>Meir</em>, or perhaps another) suggests that the <em>Tur</em>'s author wanted specifically 426 chapters. (The Web page cites this from <em>Or Chadash</em> 5755, chapter 145, which may explain <em>why</em> the author may have wanted 426 chapters. I didn't check.) But the Web page rejects that as insufficient reason to omit an important set of rules.</li>\n<li>Another possibility is along the lines of the <em>Tora T'mima</em>'s statement (which the Web page cites to <em>D'varim</em> 28, though I haven't checked it) that <em>maake</em> applies only in Israel because only there are roofs flat. The Web page rejects this also as incorrect: flat roofs exist elsewhere.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I seek alternative explanations (or good defenses of the above explanations).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Tur isn’t like the Rambam who made a comprehensive collection of all halachos.\nIn his introduction he writes that the main goal of his work is to save people from making mistakes in dinei brachos, and as an addition to that he also included hilchos shabbos umoadim etc.</p>\n<p>הטור בהקדמתו לאו\"ח מבאר שעיקר מטרתו בחיבור היא להציל מטעויות בדיני ברכות, (וכמו שאמרו ע\"ז בגמ' ילך אצל חכם וכו'), וכתוספת לזה כתב גם הל' שבת ומועדים וכו'.</p>\n<p>For example he doesn’t bring hilchos leket, shichechah, upeah, hilchos ahavas yisroel, and hilchos loshon hara, the halachah of not leaving Eretz Yisroel, hilchos shviis, the halachah of kanoyim pogmim bo, hilchos sorer umoreh etc.. He writes he doesn’t want to cover hilchos matnos aniyim because most people are non Jews and they would take matnos aniyim anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאידנא אין נוהגין בהן, לפי שהרוב נכרים, אם יניחום יבואו נכרים ויטלום, לפיכך איני רוצה להאריך בהם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of this, as opposed to what the Rabbonim from dinonline.com wrote, I think the answer of the Torah Temimah is satisfactory. Just like the Tur omitted hilchos matnos aniyim even though there could be places where the majority population is Jewish enough that there wouldn’t be a concern of goyim taking the leftovers, he still omitted those halachos because in <em>his</em> local it was not relevant. The same logic applies to hilchos maakeh. Where he lived it probably was not common to have a terrace, and therefore he chose not to address them.</p>\n<p>I mentioned you’re question to a friend, a Talmid Chochom, and he dismissed the question along the lines of what I write. I don’t mean to discourage you in finding a more geshmake answer.</p>\n<p>I saw it mentioned in a <a href=\"http://forum.otzar.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=25563&sid=6e6b19ff8bffb27a918ce2c8bbcd11d1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forum</a> that the Satmar Rebbe makes an Inyian of certain halachos missing in Shulchan Aruch like those of leaving Eretz Yisroel</p>\n<p>הויואל משה עושה עניין מכך שאין הלכה מפורשת בשו\"ע שאסור לצאת מא\"י לחו\"ל [ורק נרמז ד\"ז באו\"ח סי' תקלא</p>\n<p>I suppose the Tur doesn’t bring the Halachos of leaving Eretz Yisroel even though they are very much relevant for people living there, since he lived in Spain he also omitted them. This is even being that this Halachah applies to people traveling there from chutz laaretz, a common practice. This last point is probably why the Satmar Rebbe made a deal of this omission specifically.</p>\n<p>אולי האמור כאן הוא היישוב לזה, שבטור לא נכתבה הלכה זו, כשם שלא כתב הל' שביעית, מפני שגר בחו\"ל.</p>\n<p>Again the idea of him not mentioning halachos not nogea to his particular location, even if the mitzvah is noheg bizman haze. Along the lines of what the Tur wrote regarding his omission of hilchos matnos aniyim I quoted above, since the mitzvah of maakeh is very rare he also omitted it.</p>\n<p>In regards to the answer of Rav Mazuz (although he only wrote it al derech haremez), I find his explanation is a dochek because the Tur could have just brought hilchos maakeh within siman 116 where he discuses other halachos related to shmiras hanefesh, and would still have only 426 simanim.</p>\n\n\n",

Why on Chanukah is pirsumei nisa emphasized as a prerequisite for proper fulfillment of the mitzvah?</p>\n\n<p>ANSWER: The Syrian-Greeks endeavored to detach the Jews from Torah study. However, they did not suffice with this evil plan, but also demanded that the Jews write on the horn of the ox that they were denouncing their share in the G‑d of Israel (Midrash Rabbah, Bereishit 2:4).</p>\n\n<p>They made the strange request that the Jewish people use the horn of the ox because in those days it was customary to travel on wagons and chariots which were driven by oxen. The oxen would span the roads and go from place to place, and the horn is the most prominent and visible part of the ox. Therefore, they demanded that their denial in Hashem be written on the ox’s horn so that it would receive the widest publicity possible.</p>\n\n<p>To counteract this, our Sages required that when we fulfill the mitzvah of lighting the Menorah, which commemorates the miracle Hashem did because of our allegiance to Him, it is to be done so as to attract the most public attention possible.</p>\n\n<p>(עי' יפה תואר על מד\"ר בראשית ב:ד)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Interesting question. I have no source, but a possibility may be that the other miracles you mentioned (besides the correct response that we have a different way of expressing it by reading the Megillah) is as follows: </p>\n\n<p>With the neis of Purim, the entire kingdom was aware of the impending crisis and the \"turnaround,\" so the neis of Purim was well known (once we accept that Hashem was behind the scenes,so we just need to express that story and remind ourselves of the details).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Chanukah miracle was clearly a miracle, but was probably known to only a handful of people so Chazal required that we each personally re-enact an actual lighting to impress upon us the miracle (which was hidden in the Bais haMikdash.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, in his [Daf Yomi notes][2], comments that here the Gemara is using the term aveira and when it does, it is usually talking about sexual temptations.  So it appears that Rabbi Nachman is saying that sexual thoughts and fantasies are worse than actual sexual acts.  Rabbi Steinsaltz then cites Rashi's explanation that this does not refer to the severity of the sin, but to the lust that accompanies thinking about the sin, which is even greater than what exists during the sinful act itself. However, Rabbi Steinsaltz notes that most other commentators understand the statement to be referring to the severity of the thought and the act.  E.g., in the Moreh Nevuchim, the Rambam explains that the mind, the intellect, is on a much higher level than physical activities. Therefore, sinning in one’s thoughts creates greater damage to the person than does an act of sinning.  I like the Ohr ha-Chaim's approach which says that once someone has sinned physically, he has satisfied his inner need and is ready to begin a process of teshuvah – repentance – leading to atonement.  However, sinful thoughts which are never acted upon, never satisfy the person, and he will never try to undo or repent from them.</p>\n\n<p>So from the point of view of the Sages, your feelings of arousal at the sight of pretty women is natural, but also more sinful because you might cause yourself to do an aveira, whether it be engaging a prostitute or masturbation.  The usual answer I hear is that if this is a problem for you, you need to find a wife ASAP so that you have a permissible outlet for your sexual urges.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we celebrate Chanukah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The more I read about Chanukah, the less I understand why we celebrate the holiday. The victory, as I understand it, was costly and very short-lived. Yes, the Temple was restored, but only to be destroyed ~232 years later, perhaps as the result of nationalistic tendencies that developed during the Hasmonean period. So Chanukah to me seems like the beginning of the end of the Second Temple era. It's fun but I struggle to enjoy it for that reason. What am I missing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>A Chanukah Shiur by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, delivered at Moriah Synagogue, circa-1950, transcribed by <a href=\"http://www.parsha.net/Bereishis/MiketzChanuka76.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Nisson E. Shulman</a>, explains the meaning of Chanukah and shows that Chanukah itself is basically a \"hidden\" celebration. We speak of the fight against the Syrian-Greeks, but that was not the main battle. As with many of the trials, tribulations and struggles of our people, the main fight was against our brethren. While the \"outside\" political victory was short lived (and betrayed by the Hasmoneans themselves), the real victory was permanent and continues today as we celebrate bris milah, shabbos, and rosh chodesh.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The problem of Chanukah was not destruction, but defilement, tum'a;\n  tim'u kol hashemanim [=they defiled all the oil (a quotation from Maoz Tzur)]. Kesheamad malchut Yavan? Lohi, ela kesheamdu\n  hamityavnim... [=\"When the Greek kingdom rose\" (a quotation from liturgy)? No, when the mityavnim, Hellenists, rose]. But our rabbis sought to hide this as much as possible\n  because dibru belashon nekiya [=they spoke with clean language].</p>\n  \n  <p>Alma deisgalya [=the exposed world] was the war against the Greeks. Alma deiskasya [=the hidden world] was the\n  war against the Hellenists.</p>\n  \n  <p>So why don't we see this in the texts? We do, but we must lift the\n  cover, since our sages did not want to speak evil about the Jews, even\n  about the wicked ones, and so they hid the real story between the\n  lines.</p>\n  \n  <p>The whole story of Chanukah was euphemised.  This is particularly\n  apparent from the prayer, Biyemey Matityanu... The excessive\n  repetition expresses it very well. \"You, in Your great mercy, stood by\n  them in the time of their distress; ravta et rivam - you fought their\n  battle\". More explicitly, \"danta et dinam - you judged their case.\" Do\n  you want us to be even more explicit? \"You delivered the strong into\n  the hands of the weak\". Even more explicitly? \"The many into the hands\n  of the few\". Still not satisfied? \"The pure into the hands of the\n  impure\". Do you, then, demand an even more explicit statement?\" Very\n  well, but we say it sadly and very reluctantly, reshaim beyad\n  tzadikim, vezeidim beyad oskei Toratecha\" [=\"the wicked into the hands of the righteous and the sinners into the hand of those who involve themselves with Your Torah\"].</p>\n  \n  <p>From the time the Jews re-entered the Heychal [=main room of the Temple], the war against the\n  mityavnim was virtually won, and mityavnim were nevermore in the\n  majority. So this is an eternal miracle. That is why we still\n  celebrate it....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Note the rashi in Beshalach about \"chamushim\" points out that 80% of the Bnai Yisrael died before the Exodus to enable it to occur.\nThis was about a millenium before the Chashmonaim so we see that the problems can recur. However, since the days of the misyavnim, we have not been in as perilous a situation (though it may be since we are in galus and they have never had such political power again). Even in the days of the \"Enlightenment\" and the attempts by the \"secular\" to destroy Judaism, they have not been in a position to <strong>force</strong> the destruction of Judaism (even seeing what has happened on the modern college campuses).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I gave a Shi'ur last Friday night about \"Interesting Hava Aminas Relating to Ḥanukkah\", and the fist <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%95%D7%95%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hava Amina</a> I discussed was the possibility that we should not celebrate Ḥanukkah at all.</p>\n\n<p>This is a very famous question, but not for the main reason you gave.  First, the timeline provided in the question needs to be challenged.  The Ḥanukkah <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt\" rel=\"nofollow\">revolt</a> began in approximately 165 BCE (depending on interpretation), and the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty\" rel=\"nofollow\">kingdom</a>\" of the Ḥashmonaim was established sometime thereafter (also depending on <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Maccabees.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">interpretation</a>), but not later than 140 BCE.  However you calculate, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70_CE)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple was destroyed</a> no earlier than 68 CE.  In other words, even taking the shortest possible number of years from the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty to the destruction of the Temple, the timeline spans over 200 years (see Maimonides, Laws of Megillah and Ḥanukkah, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3a03.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ch. 3</a>).  Even taking your timeline (which I don't begin to understand), 150 years is not very short. Many \"empires\" lasted for far shorter periods (see Wikipedia list of empires <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_empires\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>__</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of all of the above, we aren't celebrating an empire or any particular dynasty.  We aren't even celebrating any particular military victory in and of itself.  To oversimplify, what we are celebrating is Jewish religious continuity, which was <em>enabled</em> by the military victory and establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty.  Please see <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/category/zemanim/11-chanukah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peninei Halachah, Hil. Zemanim, Ch. 11 on Ḥanukkah</a>, in which he discusses at length the reasons why we celebrate it even today, despite the many reasons not to celebrate it (including some of the issues you raised - though not the timeline).</p>\n\n\n",

So, as Shalom pointed out, many college educated Jews who looked into the halachoth regarding the issue will more than likely not frown upon hearing a group of 3+ women singing because at that point it becomes to impossible to distinguish which voice belongs to which girl, and therefore circumvents and sexual immorality. And there are many rulings that say that ANY recording of women is not considered a woman's voice, such as the ruling of Ovadia Yosef.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maran Rabbeinu Ovadia Yosef zt”l rules (in his Responsa Yabia Omer,\n  Volume 1, Chapter 6 and Volume 9, Chapter 108, Section 43) that\n  according to the letter of the law, one may act leniently and listen\n  to a woman singing over the radio and certainly in a recorded format\n  from a while before. Additionally, this is especially true if one has\n  never seen how the woman singing looks since one has never looked at\n  her or her picture. Nevertheless, even if one has seen the woman\n  singing, since this is not the woman’s actual voice, this is not\n  prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, Ovadia Yosef is a renowned Sephardi posek. Which means your typical \"orthodox ashkenazi community\" might not follow his ruling, or might have never even heard of it. Or they might follow their own Ashkenazi rulings that disregard Ovadia Yosef completely:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the other hand, Hagaon Harav Eliezer Yehuda Waldenberg zt”l  took issue with this ruling on Maran zt”l, for although even according to his opinion, hearing a woman’s voice over the radio is not prohibited, nevertheless, how is it that Maran zt”l ruled so leniently for the public (as a blanket ruling)? Certainly, listening to women singing would cause individuals to have improper thoughts which is a Torah prohibition itself! Thus, according to Rav Waldenberg, one must rule stringently and not allow room for leniency when there is cause for the public to stumble.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source for both: <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/ReadHalacha.aspx?HalachaID=3688\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://halachayomit.co.il/en/ReadHalacha.aspx?HalachaID=3688</a></p>\n\n<p>But i think the most likely situation you will find is people not really knowing what is permissible and what isn't, and so they might be opposed to hearing any woman sing because they aren't sure what the halacha is. And so even if you've checked all the halachot, studied them in depth, you might still find a large percentage of people who thinks you're making them sin by playing the radio.</p>\n\n<p>And so if you are trying to \"prevent\" other men from sinning via qol isha, then this is a more complex subject that has to do more with \"who are you with\" rather than \"what the halacha is.\" Because there are lots of very reputable halachic sources on these issues, and communities/individuals just kind of pick and choose between them, or are ignorant of them all and just say no to all female singing.</p>\n\n<p>A side example would be the following: i follow the kashruth rulings of Rabbi Yitzchak Abadi, which means i can buy most of my food from any regular supermarket. However, MANY orthodox Jews won't buy anything that doesn't have a hecsher on the label. So when it comes to feeding Orthodox Jews in my house i have discovered that even though i could be feeding them completely kosher food, they might not consider it kosher. So what i do is i tell them in advance that i follow the rulings of Chacham Yitzchak Abadi, a famous Orthodox posek, to give them enough time to research him and come to a decision. And then if my guests are okay with that, i feed them.</p>\n\n\n",

Secondly, when the child reached the age of Bat Mitzvah (12) or Bar Mitzvah (13), then he or she should have confirmed this before a bais din as an adult in order for the conversion to be considered valid. I know of people who as an adult converted again because the initial conversion was not valid (for various reasons) or because they could not verify the validity of the conversion. I would suggest discussing this with a rav who is an expert in this.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.judaismconversion.org/contact.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orthodox Conversion to Judaism</a> which has the contact information for the Rabbinical Council of America on conversion which is also recognized by the Israeli chief rabbinate as a valid source.

    "content": "# What's behind the disagreement about the first words of the blessings immediately before Shema?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud, in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.11b?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">Berachot 11b</a>, records a disagreement between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_of_Nehardea\">Shemuel</a> and the rabbinic majority regarding the beginning of the blessings that we say immediately before <em>Shema</em> in the evening and in the morning. According to Shemuel, these blessings should begin with the words \"אהבה רבה\" - \"With abounding love,\" while the rabbinic majority says that they should begin with \"אהבת עולם\" - \"With everlasting love.\" Different ways of relating to this disagreement and the adjacent Talmudic material have resulted in the primary Sepharadic practice being to begin with \"אהבת עולם\" in both the evening and the morning and the primary Ashkenazic practice being to begin with \"אהבת עולם\" in the evening and \"אהבה רבה\" in the morning, as recorded by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch\">Shulchan Aruch</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\">Rama</a>, respectively, in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.60.1?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">Orach Chayim 60:1</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is behind this disagreement? Do Shemuel and the other rabbis simply represent a bifurcation of the tradition about this blessing, or did they disagree philosophically about the meaning we're meant to express?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Making the question a bit stronger, the Talmud quotes a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita\">baraita</a> supporting Shemuel, saying \"We do not say 'אהבת עולם,' but 'אהבה רבה.'\" That means that already in the Mishnaic era, there must have been people using each of these phrases, such that someone felt the need to make a statement in support of one. Again, why? What meaning was this person choosing, and what was he rejecting?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that the rabbinic majority cites <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.31?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, which includes their chosen phrase, as support, but the fact that a phrase appears somewhere in the Bible is only a pointer to a place to find a possible meaning, but not a meaning in and of itself.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the major commentaries printed on the page in the Talmud, at the Rosh and Rif and the major commentaries printed on their pages, and at the Maharsha, and none of  them discuss the meaning behind these two alternate phrases.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14490&pgnum=270\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benei Yisaschar in Maamarei Sivan, maamar dalet, ot vav</a> explains that the difference between the two phrases is that \"אהבה רבה\" intimates a love which is beyond the normal boundaries of this world, and hence in his view refers to the giving of the Torah, whereas \"אהבת עולם\" refers to the standard love of a father to a child, who provides for his physical and existential needs, but would not then be directly referring to the giving of the Torah, and the portion of the bracha afterwards which does refer to the Torah is only mentioned as an aside.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kashrut of a knife without a blade\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not understand all of the concepts that this question relies on, nor do i know what they're called and how to look it up.</p>\n\n<p>At home, we're always told to use a spoon and not a knife in things like chummus and mayonnaise, so that it doesn't become milchig/fleishig. My understanding is that there's something special about a knife that can transfer kashrut status.  (Maybe דוחקא דסכינא, <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/kashurs-kurrents-2011/summer-kashrus-kurrents-2011/597/sharp-awareness-in-the-kitchen/#_ftnref6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star-K's term</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>What about a knife without an actual blade? We have these spreaders that are basically knives without a blade. They're useful for cream cheese, butter, and the like. Since they are able to \"cut\" these soft things, and look like a knife, do the same halachot apply? (Of course, a spoon can also \"cut\" through soft spreads.)</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KwMrQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KwMrQ.jpg\" alt=\"photo of cheese spreader\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I suppose the question boils down to how sharp must a knife be to be able to change the status of things it touches.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The issue you are describing (<em>duchka desakina</em>) is one of a knife cutting hot food (<em>davar harif</em>, e.g., onions) and transferring taste to it. Therefore a meat knife would transfer meat taste to an onion it has cut. Whether the knife has an \"edgy blade\" or not, it is the pressure applied to the food which transfers taste.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed Star-K (<a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/597/sharp-awareness-in-the-kitchen/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, under III) explicitly writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A cold taste transfer may occur with any utensil that applies\n  concentrated pressure, not just a knife as in our previous example. \n  For instance, if the prongs of a milchig fork are inserted into a\n  spicy pickle, the pickle would then be considered dairy and could not\n  be added to a meat sandwich.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the case of a butter knife, that is not used for <em>davar harif</em>, there is no such issue. So what matters is more the use of the knife than the type of blade.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I think the reason your family doesn't want you to use a knife with humus and mayo is that there might be actual pieces of meat on it which would then be deposited in the humus/mayo, and could be carried away to another dish by someone else. A spoon doesn't have this issue as one normally doesn't eat meat with it. But having a \"humus knife\" would achieve the same purpose.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I correctly understood your question and that this is helpful. <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-5-the-status-of-pareve-charif-foods-cut-with-a-meat-dairy-knife/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is a good summary of the issues of <em>duchka desakina</em> and <em>davar harif</em>. Finally, I checked all the above with R Yonathan Jessurun who concurs.</p>\n\n\n",

A word is used in context. In English for example, we speak of \"the South\" to mean the southern portion of the eastern United States even though someone may be in Mexico when using the term. Similarly here we speak of the \"South\" relative to Yerushalayim when speaking about different parts of the country of Yisrael. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the answer to your question is \"yes\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Negev actually means \"the dry area\" (NGV root means \"dry\")which is in the southern part of Eretz Yisrael. \n\"Negbah\" means \"to the dry area,\" not a cardinal direction.\n\"Minegev\" in the later verse means \"from the dry area.\" (In any event, it is not switching meanings. In the first instance the \"heh\" at the end of the noun means \"to\" that area. The mem in front of the noun means from that area. So it is not a contradiction. But you also asked if it was a cardinal direction. It is not.)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, \"yamah\" doesn't mean \"to the west\", rather it means \"to the sea.\" Both of these would be used in relation to Eretz Yisrael but not other lands.\nA more cardinal-like direction would be \"maaravah\" meaning \"towards where the sun sets.\" Of course that's west.</p>\n\n<p>\"Kedmah\" means \"to the east\" because it is in the direction of where Avraham was \"mi'kedem,\"(beforehand)\nIn other contexts, \"to the east\" would be said \"mizrachah shemesh\" (towards where the sun rises) which is more like a cardinal direction.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I believe I saw it in Rav Hirsch's commentary, but \"tzafonah\" would mean\"towards where things are hidden\" since, in Eretz Yisrael, being above the equator, the sun always remains on the southern part of the sky. So the northern wall of a building (for instance) never gets direct sunlight, it is always tzafun/(hidden) in shadows. </p>\n\n<p>I don't recall why \"daromah\" means \"to the south,\" but I imagine it also has to do with the sun and would be more like a cardinal direction.</p>\n\n\n",

Consider that they had to arrange to purchase enough food for everyone (including Binyamin's children). Also this teaches the lesson for the future (Just answer the question as asked, do not volunteer information)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since the obviously unfriendly viceroy had not asked if they had any\n  brothers at home, they should not have volunteered it (<em>Haamek\n  Davar</em>). They defended themselves against Yaakov's charge that they\n  had loose tounges (<em>Akeidah</em>), saying that Yosef had questioned them\n  exhaustively, but not in such a sinister way that they had reason to\n  fear the consequences of a full response (<em>Alshich</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point is that the medrash states that they entered Egypt from \"different gates\" so that the only way they could keep their stories straight was to tell the truth (besides not being good liars). Thus the information was already in the records and they were trying to defend themselves against a charge of spying.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Rashbam Joseph did ask them, though perhaps not explicitly.

    "content": "# Was Pharaoh a Prophet?\n\n## Frage\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genesis 41</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. ב  וְהִנֵּה מִן-הַיְאֹר,\n  עֹלֹת שֶׁבַע פָּרוֹת, יְפוֹת מַרְאֶה, וּבְרִיאֹת בָּשָׂר;\n  וַתִּרְעֶינָה, בָּאָחוּ.  2 And, behold, there came up out of the river\n  seven kine, well-favoured and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the\n  reed-grass. ג  וְהִנֵּה שֶׁבַע פָּרוֹת אֲחֵרוֹת, עֹלוֹת אַחֲרֵיהֶן\n  מִן-הַיְאֹר, רָעוֹת מַרְאֶה, וְדַקּוֹת בָּשָׂר; וַתַּעֲמֹדְנָה אֵצֶל\n  הַפָּרוֹת, עַל-שְׂפַת הַיְאֹר.    3 And, behold, seven other kine came up\n  after them out of the river, ill favoured and lean-fleshed; and stood\n  by the other kine upon the brink of the river. ד  וַתֹּאכַלְנָה\n  הַפָּרוֹת, רָעוֹת הַמַּרְאֶה וְדַקֹּת הַבָּשָׂר, אֵת שֶׁבַע הַפָּרוֹת,\n  יְפֹת הַמַּרְאֶה וְהַבְּרִיאֹת; וַיִּיקַץ, פַּרְעֹה.  4 And the\n  ill-favoured and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favoured\n  and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. ה  וַיִּישָׁן, וַיַּחֲלֹם שֵׁנִית;\n  וְהִנֵּה שֶׁבַע שִׁבֳּלִים, עֹלוֹת בְּקָנֶה אֶחָד--בְּרִיאוֹת\n  וְטֹבוֹת. 5 And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven\n  ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. ו  וְהִנֵּה שֶׁבַע\n  שִׁבֳּלִים, דַּקּוֹת וּשְׁדוּפֹת קָדִים--צֹמְחוֹת, אַחֲרֵיהֶן.    6 And,\n  behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up\n  after them. ז  וַתִּבְלַעְנָה, הַשִּׁבֳּלִים הַדַּקּוֹת, אֵת שֶׁבַע\n  הַשִּׁבֳּלִים, הַבְּרִיאוֹת וְהַמְּלֵאוֹת; וַיִּיקַץ פַּרְעֹה,\n  וְהִנֵּה חֲלוֹם.  7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and\n  full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. ח  וַיְהִי\n  בַבֹּקֶר, וַתִּפָּעֶם רוּחוֹ, וַיִּשְׁלַח וַיִּקְרָא\n  אֶת-כָּל-חַרְטֻמֵּי מִצְרַיִם, וְאֶת-כָּל-חֲכָמֶיהָ; וַיְסַפֵּר\n  פַּרְעֹה לָהֶם אֶת-חֲלֹמוֹ, וְאֵין-פּוֹתֵר אוֹתָם לְפַרְעֹה.  8 And it\n  came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent\n  and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men\n  thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that\n  could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It appears that Pharaoh is having a prophetic dream from God. At least, that's what Joseph says is happening.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כח  הוּא הַדָּבָר, אֲשֶׁר דִּבַּרְתִּי אֶל-פַּרְעֹה:  <strong>אֲשֶׁר הָאֱלֹהִים עֹשֶׂה, הֶרְאָה אֶת-פַּרְעֹה.</strong>   28 That is the thing which I spoke unto Pharaoh: <strong>what God is about to do He hath shown unto Pharaoh.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So does this make Pharaoh a prophet? If you tell me no because he is unable to interpret his own dream, then that would mean that Joseph wasn't a prophet when he had his first dream. Because he seems unable to interpret it and resorts to telling his family who try and interpret it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genesis 37</p>\n  \n  <p>ה  וַיַּחֲלֹם יוֹסֵף חֲלוֹם, וַיַּגֵּד לְאֶחָיו; וַיּוֹסִפוּ עוֹד,\n  שְׂנֹא אֹתוֹ. 5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his\n  brethren; and they hated him yet the more. ו  וַיֹּאמֶר, אֲלֵיהֶם: \n  שִׁמְעוּ-נָא, הַחֲלוֹם הַזֶּה אֲשֶׁר חָלָמְתִּי.  6 And he said unto\n  them: 'Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: ז  וְהִנֵּה\n  אֲנַחְנוּ מְאַלְּמִים אֲלֻמִּים, בְּתוֹךְ הַשָּׂדֶה, וְהִנֵּה קָמָה\n  אֲלֻמָּתִי, וְגַם-נִצָּבָה; וְהִנֵּה תְסֻבֶּינָה אֲלֻמֹּתֵיכֶם,\n  וַתִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶיןָ לַאֲלֻמָּתִי.  7 for, behold, we were binding\n  sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright;\n  and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and bowed down to my\n  sheaf.' ח  וַיֹּאמְרוּ לוֹ, אֶחָיו, הֲמָלֹךְ תִּמְלֹךְ עָלֵינוּ,\n  אִם-מָשׁוֹל תִּמְשֹׁל בָּנוּ; וַיּוֹסִפוּ עוֹד שְׂנֹא אֹתוֹ,\n  עַל-חֲלֹמֹתָיו וְעַל-דְּבָרָיו.   8 And his brethren said to him: 'Shalt\n  thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over\n  us?' And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his\n  words. ט  וַיַּחֲלֹם עוֹד חֲלוֹם אַחֵר, וַיְסַפֵּר אֹתוֹ לְאֶחָיו;\n  וַיֹּאמֶר, הִנֵּה חָלַמְתִּי חֲלוֹם עוֹד, וְהִנֵּה הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ\n  וְהַיָּרֵחַ וְאַחַד עָשָׂר כּוֹכָבִים, מִשְׁתַּחֲוִים לִי.    9 And he\n  dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said:\n  'Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon\n  and eleven stars bowed down to me.' י  וַיְסַפֵּר אֶל-אָבִיו,\n  וְאֶל-אֶחָיו, וַיִּגְעַר-בּוֹ אָבִיו, וַיֹּאמֶר לוֹ מָה הַחֲלוֹם\n  הַזֶּה אֲשֶׁר חָלָמְתָּ:  הֲבוֹא נָבוֹא, אֲנִי וְאִמְּךָ וְאַחֶיךָ,\n  לְהִשְׁתַּחֲו‍ֹת לְךָ, אָרְצָה.   10 And he told it to his father, and\n  to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him: 'What\n  is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy\n  brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the earth?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So was Pharaoh a prophet?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Pharaoh is not the first one in the Torah to get a dream. Avimelech and Lavan both had clear. lucid dreams in which it was a clear message from God to them. Nevertheless they aren't considered prophets for that.</p>\n\n<p>But in Pharaoh's case it was much less than that. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.30a.19?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">In the Talmud</a> we find a concept of the Baal Hachalomos, which is a sort-of angel or demon who gives dreams, and can't even be relied upon as giving the whole truth.</p>\n\n<p>Prophecy is when God speaks with someone and sends him to speak in His name. Clairvoyance, getting signs or even having premonitions and lucid dreams are not prophecy.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If a lady missed the time to light the Shabbat candles, what should she do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If shekia (according to sefardim and litvish minhagim) is 4:59, and the lady (who is litvish or sefardi) was busy preparing for the Shabbat. If by the time she got to the candles it was 5:00, what are her options?</p>\n\n<p>Does she forgo the obligation to light the candles since Shabbat already started or is there some leeway? Perhaps one could rely on Rabbeinu Tam.</p>\n\n<p>In the case that she missed the time, does she have to light an additional candle for the rest of her life or is this case not considered \"forgetting to light\" (something I read what one must do in the event that they forget to light one week) since she lost track of time rather than forgot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>If it is within the 18 minutes before sundown, she can light. (Not sure if this is true for the entire 18 minutes, since tosfos Shabbos <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/59695/unintentional-tosefes-shabbos\">is required</a> both at the beginning and the end of Shabbos; I remember reading an opinion here that 4 minutes before sunset is the latest. On the other hand, I have also read that tosfos Shabbos is considered when calculating the zmanim, so by just following the prescribed times, one already includes tosfos Shabbos. Various opinions are discussed in comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/46058/1516\">here</a>. Before 4 minutes, she can definitely still light.) </p>\n\n<p>She definitely cannot light at or after sunset--that is, during Shabbos--and I don't think there is any reason she would be justified in following Rabbeinu Tam for one week, unless that were her regular minhag.</p>\n\n<p>According to several canonical sources (cited <a href=\"http://matzav.com/hadlokas-nairos-part-3-how-many-candles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), a woman must add an extra candle going forward for each week that she misses lighting as a result of her own negligence.  <a href=\"http://forums.dansdeals.com/index.php?topic=7481.70;wap2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> discussion suggests that this k'nas (penalty) applies to single men, too. (According to Dov Eisenberg's G<em>uide for the Jewish Woman and Girl</em>, it doesn't apply to baalos teshuva. [Converts are not mentioned but one would think according to this it wouldn't apply to them kal v'chomer.]) </p>\n\n<p>I had never heard that she could ask a non-Jew to light for her if missing candle-lighting caused her distress, and have never heard of anyone's doing that. But I assume it is a legitimate possibility based on Fred's source (<em>Bei'ur Halacha</em>, p. 261). I would also wonder if her husband could light for her if he had not yet davened.</p>\n\n<p>Some women have the ~custom to make a blessing in front of candles lit by others if they miss lighting (or generally do not light candles--as is the case for many Yeshivish single women.) This should be, if anything, a blessing without Hashem's name (source: <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/hashoneh-halachos/1097-mikvah-friday-night/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/hashoneh-halachos/1097-mikvah-friday-night/</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Edited to Add: One thing she <em>can</em> do, and which people frequently do, if she expects to miss candle-lighting is ask another woman--anywhere in the world--to have her in mind while she lights. If she has already missed, she may be consoled to hear that someone else had her in mind. (Some people deliberately have a lot of others in mind in case they should miss.) Note that none of this means that she was actually yotzei the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to overstate how common this is, though--most <em>frum</em> women take hadlakat nerot very seriously and would only miss it in an inevitable circumstance. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Regarding the part of the question if she missed, if she should light additional candles in our days, here is a teshuva that i was zoche to write.</p>\n<p><em>As this is AI translation, I will paste in the hebrew original too at the end.</em></p>\n<p>Question: A woman who forgot to light Shabbat candles in our times—does she incur the penalty of lighting an additional candle from the following Shabbat onward?</p>\n<p>Answer: The source for this custom is brought by the Rema (Orach Chaim 263:1) in the name of Rabbeinu the Mahari”l as follows:\n\"A woman who forgot once to light [Shabbat candles] shall light three candles all her life (Mahari”l), for one may add for the sake of a symbolic distinction, provided one does not lessen [the amount].”\nThis is also ruled by the Magen Avraham (263:3), who writes:\n\"If she forgot multiple times, she must add [a candle] each time, for the matter is for the sake of recognition, that she should henceforth be careful about honoring Shabbat (Beit Yosef).\"\nThe same is found in the Mishnah Berurah (263:7) and Kaf HaChaim (263:10).</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham adds:\n\"And for this reason, it seems to me that if she was prevented [from lighting] due to circumstances beyond her control, such as being in prison or the like, she need not add a candle.”\nThis is followed by the Mishnah Berurah (ibid.) and other authorities.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that if even in cases of coercion (ones) this is said, then certainly if a woman was preoccupied the entire day with Shabbat preparations and intended to light shortly before Shabbat but forgot due to circumstances—she is considered coerced and not liable for the penalty.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I found that this is also the opinion of Maran [R. Ovadia Yosef] ztz”l in Chazon Ovadia (Shabbat Vol. 1, p. 174):\nIn She’elot u-Teshuvot Rivevot Ephraim (Vol. 1, §184), the question was raised regarding a woman who was busy with household matters on Friday afternoon and assumed she would light candles immediately after finishing. However, the work dragged on and the time for candle lighting passed—must she light an additional candle each week?\nHe writes that seemingly, based on the Magen Avraham who exempts in cases of coercion, this too should be considered coercion. However, he argues that simply being preoccupied is not coercion but negligence, and therefore she must add a candle.\nHowever, he omits the ruling of Maran in Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 108:8), which states that if one failed to pray Mincha due to being occupied and assuming there would be time afterwards—but ultimately missed the time—it is considered coercion and one may make it up.</p>\n<p>It appears that since this penalty is merely a stringency—as the Rema notes in Darkei Moshe—then in our times, when electric lights illuminate the entire house, if one forgot to light oil or wax candles, there is no need to add a candle. The mitzvah is fulfilled with electric lighting, as there is no lack of shalom bayit (domestic harmony), and the blessings are not essential for fulfilling the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>This is also written in Shu”t Avnei Yashfeh Vol. 1 (§55), in the name of a great Rav, that if the electric light was on—even if it was on from the morning—and the woman did not light Shabbat candles, she should not be penalized with adding a candle.\nHe adds that the Gaon Rabbi Yisrael Yaakov Fisher wrote similarly: if the woman turned on the electric light—even without intention for the mitzvah of Shabbat candles—she fulfills her obligation, and there is no penalty. See there.\nThe same appears in Shu”t Or LeTzion Vol. 2 (p. 170), that since there is an electric light providing shalom bayit, if she turned it on to illuminate the home—even if not explicitly for the mitzvah—there is no need to penalize her.\nThis was also written by my dear departed friend, Rabbi Michael Zarhan zt”l in Shu”t Ma’ayan Chaim Vol. 2 (§32). See also Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah ch. 43 §30, and Melachim Ha’amuk p. 194, note. The same is written in Yalkut Yosef Vol. 4 (p. 121), and in Menuchat Ahava Vol. 1 (p. 89).</p>\n<p>Although Shu”t Shevet HaLevi Vol. 5 (§33), Shu”t Shraga HaMeir Vol. 7 (§83), and Shu”t Tzitz Eliezer Vol. 21 (§11) rule stringently, it seems to me that their opinion is not compelling. See there.</p>\n<p>The Rishon LeTzion Rabbi David Yosef shlit”a also brings this discussion in Halacha Berurah Vol. 15, p. 192. He writes that the halacha does not follow Avnei Yashfeh in the case where the electric light was already on from earlier in the day.\nHe rules (p. 190):\n\"Halachically, if the electric light was turned on before Shabbat for the sake of Shabbat—even if one did not explicitly intend it as a fulfillment of the mitzvah, but simply for illumination—one may rely on this lighting, and she need not add a candle. However, if the light had been on long before Shabbat and was not turned on for the sake of Shabbat, then she must add a candle from now on.”</p>\n<p>On the contrary, regarding even if the electric light had been on earlier in the day, this is explicitly stated in Menuchat Ahava (ibid.):\n\"In this case, it seems even the Pri Megadim would agree there is no need to add candles in the future, since the main light in the room is from the electric lamp and the wax candles are only supplementary. Even if the electric light was on from earlier and one did not fulfill the mitzvah with it, there is room for leniency, for the penalty was instituted due to the discomfort of sitting in darkness, not for missing the mitzvah itself.\" This is not in line with Shevet HaLevi who rules stringently.</p>\n<p>This is also implied in Or LeTzion (ibid., note 12):\n\"Since there is shalom bayit due to the electric light, if one forgot to light Shabbat candles but did turn on the electric light for the purpose of lighting the home, there is no need to penalize her with an extra candle. Even though she did not fulfill the mitzvah properly, since the home was not left in darkness, the penalty does not apply.”\nHe does not specify whether the light was turned on before plag hamincha or afterwards; rather, he bases it solely on the presence of shalom bayit due to the light.</p>\n<p>This also appears in Yalkut Yosef (Shabbat Vols. 1–2, published Av 5773), where it states:\n\"However, one must investigate the reason for the penalty imposed on a woman who forgot to light [Shabbat candles]—is it because she neglected the mitzvah that is incumbent upon her, which would be unusual, since we do not find such a penalty for the neglect of other rabbinic commandments? Or is it because, due to her actions, the peace of the home (shalom bayit) was disrupted? And since the enactment of candle lighting was for the sake of shalom bayit, which is a lofty matter, therefore the Sages imposed a penalty to ensure that women would not treat this precious mitzvah lightly.</p>\n<p>The practical difference between these two rationales is as follows: if she did not light a candle in honor of Shabbat, but there was already light in the house—whether from electric lights or even from a candle that had been lit not specifically for the mitzvah of Shabbat—then according to the first rationale, she still neglected the mitzvah, and even if she turned on the light, she did not intend to fulfill the mitzvah. However, according to the second rationale, the main reason for the penalty is that the household was left in darkness—and here, in this case, there was light in the home. Therefore, according to this second approach, there is no difference between whether she actively turned on the electric light near the start of Shabbat with the intention of honoring Shabbat, or whether the electric light had already been on beforehand—in either case, she should not be penalized.</p>\n<p>And it seems that the second rationale is more reasonable, for we do not find penalties imposed for the neglect of other mitzvot incumbent upon women. Thus, we must limit the penalty to the specific case addressed by the Rema, and accordingly, the penalty only applies when the home was left without light. Similarly, the Bach wrote that the penalty is meant to encourage her not to neglect the lighting of candles. The same was written by the Gra (Vilna Gaon), and their simple intention is due to the great importance of maintaining peace in the home.” After all this, he cites his father’s position as well.</p>\n<p>Conclusion:\nIn our times, it seems clear that if a woman forgot to light candles on Friday night due to being preoccupied with Shabbat preparations, or if there was electric light already on from before Shabbat, there is room for leniency and no need to penalize her by requiring the lighting of an additional candle.\nThis also appears to be the opinion of the esteemed Yalkut Yosef.</p>\n<p>Hebrew:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלה: אישה ששכחה להדליק נרות בזה\"ז, האם קונסים אותה להדליק נר נוסף משבת הבא?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>תשובה: הנה מקור למנהג הביא הרמ\"א (סימן רסג סעיף א) בשם רבינו המהרי\"ל בזה הלשון,  \"האשה ששכחה פעם אחת להדליק, מדלקת כל ימיה ג' נרות (מהרי\"ל) כי יכולין להוסיף על דבר המכוון נגד דבר אחר ובלבד שלא יפחות\". וכן פסק המ\"א (ס\"ק ג), וז\"ל, \"ואם שכחה כמה פעמים צריכה להוסיף בכל פעם כי הדבר משום הכיר' שתהיה זהירה מכאן ולהבא בכבוד שבת (ב\"ח)\". ע\"כ. וכ\"מ במ\"ב (ס\"ק ז), כה\"ח (אות י).</p>\n<p>הנה מוסיף המ\"א, \"ומהאי טעמא נ\"ל דאם נאנסה ולא הדליקה כגון שהיתה בבית האסורים וכיוצא בה א\"צ להוסיף\" אזלו בתרו המ\"ב (שם) ועוד פוסקים. אלא נלע\"ד שאם לגבי אנוס קאמר, לכאורה לאשה שהייתה עסוקה כולי יומא בהכנות לשבת וחשבה להדלק תכף כמה דקות לפני שבת ונאנסה ושכחה ולא הדליקה, אין קונסים אותה הרי אנוסה היא.</p>\n<p>ובאמת מצאתי שכך דעת מרן זצ\"ל בחזון עובדיה (שבת א עמוד קעד) וז\"ל, הנה בשו\"ת רבבות אפרים (ח\"א סימן קפד) נשאל באשה שהיתה עסוקה בערב שבת בעסקי הבית וכסבורה היתה שמיד שתסיים העסק שבידה תדליק הנרות, והנה, נמשך העסק שבידה עד שעבר זמן הדלקת הנרות האם צריכה להוסיף נר אחד לכל שבת? וכתב דלכאורה לפי מ\"ש המג\"א שבאונס א\"צ להוסיף נר. כאן הוה ליה כאונס אבל בפשוטו נראה שאין זה אונס אלא פשיעה כי היתה חייבת להזדרז ולהדליק הנרות. ולכן צריכה להדליק נר אחד. ע\"כ. אולם לא זכר מה שפסק מרן בש\"ע (סי' קח ס\"ח) מי שלא התפלל מנחה בעוד שהיה לו זמן להתפלל מפני שהיה סבור שישאר לו זמן אחר שיסיים העסק שהיה מתעסק בו ובין כך ובין כך עבר זמן התפלה חשוב כאנוס ויש לו תשלומין למנחה.</p>\n<p>ונראה שהואיל ואין זו אלא חומרא רחוקה, וכמ\"ש הרמ\"א בדרכי משה, בזמננו שמדליקים חשמל להאיר את כל הבית, אם שכח להדליק נרות שמן או שעוה, אינה צריכה להוסיף כלל, שיוצאים ידי חובה במנורת החשמל, שאין כאן משום הפרת שלום ביתו, וברכות אינן מעכבות. וכן כתב בשו\"ת אבני ישפה ח\"א (סי' נה) בשם גאון אחד שאם היה החשמל דלוק, ואפילו היה דלוק מן הבוקר, עכ\"פ שלא הדליקה נרות לשבת אין לקונסה להוסיף נר אחד. והוסיף, שכיוב\"ז כתב הגאון ר' ישראל יעקב פישר שאם האשה הדליקה את החשמל אפילו אם לא היתה כוונתה להדלקת נרות לכבוד שבת, יצאה י\"ח ההדלקה. ואין לקונסה. ע\"ש. וכ\"כ בשו\"ת אור לציון ח\"ב (עמוד קע). שמכיון שיש נר חשמל שדולק יש בזה שלום בית, כל שהדליקה את אור החשמל כדי שיהא הבית מואר, אין לקונס אותה להוסיף נר אחד. ע\"ש. וכן כתב ידי\"נ המנוח הרה\"ג רבי מיכאל זריהן בשו\"ת מעין חיים ח\"ב (סי' לב). ע\"ש. (ועי' בספר שמירת שבת כהלכתה פרק מג אות ל, ובספר מלכים העמוק עמוד צד בהערה). וכ\"כ בספר ילקוט יוסף ח\"ד (עמוד קכא), ובמנוחת אהבה (ח\"א עמוד פט). וע\"פ שראיתי בשו\"ת שבט הלוי ח\"ה (סי' לג), ובשו\"ת שרגא המאיר ח\"ז (סי' פג), ובשו\"ת ציץ אליעזר חלק כא (סי' יא), שכתבו להחמיר בזה, לפע\"ד אין דבריהם מוכרחים. ודו\"ק.\nוהנה הגאון הראשל\"צ הרב דוד יוסף שליט\"א הביא את דבריו בהלכה ברורה חלק טו עמוד קצב, וכתב שאין הלכה כמו האבני ישפה המובא לעיל שאפילו אם היה האור החשמל דלוק מבעוד יום. וכך פסק (שם עמוד קצ), \"ולהלכה נראה שאם הדליקו את אור החשמל לכבוד שבת והיה הדבר סמוך לשבת אפילו אם בשעת ההדלקה לא נתכוונו להדליקו לשם מצות הדלקת נרות שבת אלא הדליקוהו בסתם כדי שיהיה אור בבית לכבוד שבת יש לסמוך על הדלקה זו ואינה צריכה מכאן והלאה להדליק נר נוסף, אבל אם היה אור החשמל דלוק זמן רב קודם השבת ובשעה שהודלק לא היה הדבר לכבוד שבת צריכה מכאן והלאה להדליק נר נוסף. ע\"כ.</p>\n<p>. אלא הדברים מפורשים בספר מנוחת אהבה (שם) בבמי מנוחה, \"ובנ\"ד נראה שגם הפמ\"ג יודה שא\"צ להוסיף כלום בפעמים הבאות שהרי עיקר האור בחדר הוא ע\"י מנורת החשמל והנרות הם לתוספת בעלמא ואף אם היה אור החשמל דלוק מבעו\"י שאין יוצאים בזה יד\"ח נרות שבת מ\"מ יש להקל דהקנס שקנסוה הוא מחמת שביטלה עונג שבת שישבו בחושך ודלא כמ\"ש בשו\"ת שבט הלוי ח\"ה (חאו\"ח סימן לג) להחמיר גם כשאור החשמל היה דלוק מבעו\"י.\" ע\"כ. ונראה שכן דעת הרב אור לציון (שם) שכתב בהערה יב, \"ונראה שכיוון שעכ\"פ יש בנר חשמל משום שלום בית, אם יש שכחה להדליק נר שבת, אך הדליקה את אור החשמל כדי שיהא הבית מואר, אין לקנוס אותה להוסיף נר כדין מי ששכחה להדליק נרות שבת  וכו' שכיון שיש עכ\"פ שלום בית אין לקונסה אף שלא קיימה מצות הדלקת נרות\", ע\"כ. ולא כתב הרב במפורש אם הדליקה מבעוד יום או אחרי פלג המנחה, אלא תלה אותו משום שלום בית והיכא דיש אור החשמל יש שלום בית אפילו אם הדליקה מבעוד יום גמור.</p>\n<p>וכך משמע מדברי הרב הילקו\"י שבת א-ב (אב תשע\"ג) וזת\"ד, \"אלא שיש לחקור בטעם מה שקנסו את האשה ששכחה ולא הדליקה אם הוא מפני שביטלה את המצוה המוטלת עליה, מה שלא מצינו קנס בשאר ביטול מצוות חכמים או מפני שבגרמא דילה, בטל השלום בבית וכיון שתקנת הדלקת הנר היא מפני שלום בית והוא דבר נשגב לפיכך קנסוה כדי שהנשים לא תחרפנה במצוה יקרה זו. והנפקא מינה בחקירה זו היא שלא הדליקה נר לכבוד שבת והיה אור דלוק בבית או אור חשמל או אפי' נר דלוק שהודלק שלא לשם מצות נר שבת דלצד א' סוף סוף ביטלה את המצוה ואף אם היא הדליקה את האור הרי לא כיוונה לשם מצוה אבל לצד ב' עיקר טעם הקנס הוא שנשארו בלא אור בבית והרי הכא היה אור בביתם ולפ\"ז אין הבדל בין אם עשתה מעשה והדליקה את אור החשמל סמוך לשבת וכיוונה לשם נר שבת לבין אם היה החשמל דלוק ועומד וממילא א\"צ לקונסה ומסתברא לן כצד ב' דהא לא מצינו קנס בביטול שאר מצוות המוטלות על האשה ואין לך אלא חידושו במה שמבואר ברמ\"א בעיקר הקנס וממילא הקנס הוא דוקא כשלא היה אור בבית וכיו\"ב כתב הב\"ח דהקנס הוא כדי לזרזה שלא תבטל הדלקת הנר וכ\"כ הגר\"ז ובפשטות הכוונה היא לאור החשיבות הגדולה לשלום בית. עכ\"ד. ואחרי כל זה הביא את דברי מרן אביו הגדול הנ\"ל.</p>\n<p>מכל האמור, בזמנינו, נלע\"ד מי ששכחה להדליק נרות בע\"ש מחמת תירדות לשבת או הייתה לה נר חשמל דלוק מבעוד יום, אפשר להקל ולא לקנוס. וכך נראה בדעת הגאון הילקו\"י.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One may light Shabbat candles until sunset (generally 18 minutes after \"candle-lighting time\") but not a moment after sunset.

    "content": "# When is it acceptable for a non-Jew working towards Orthodox conversion to grow peyot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am working towards an Orthodox conversion, and physical reminders continue to help me on my path as reminders - like tzitzit and kippah. I would like to grow out my peyot, but I am concerned I may offend some of the community members. When is it acceptable for a non-Jew working towards Orthodox conversion to grow peyot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It depends. \nIf you mean that until now you have been completely shaving them like a crew cut, then letting them grow a bit should be fine, no one would really notice a major change. (<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/735346/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/halachos-of-peyos-harosh/\">Click here</a> for a full explanation on Peyos)</p>\n\n<p>If you mean to grow them out long until they curl around your ears or even longer, well i will tell you what my rebbe told me - \"It's much easier to shave your beard then to cut off your peyos.\" </p>\n\n<p>what he meant was that growing peyos to make an obvious statement about how you express your Judaism is a very real responsibility. if G-d forbid you are in a situation that you will need to cut them off it will be emotionally difficult, much more so than shaving a beard. </p>\n\n<p>There are many Frum orthodox people who don't have long peyot and they have a very deep relationship with Hashem just the same. Perhaps wait a bit. get more involved with your studies and work on the inner stuff of being Jewish. Once you are in a comfortable place there, you can then decide about adding the external stuff!</p>\n\n<p>Much Hatzlacha, </p>\n\n<p>not sure where you are on your journey, but i hope it goes well for you!</p>\n\n<p>(I am a young rabbi who has dealt with a few people going through conversions, not an expert, but i know a little of what you are going through)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If you are working toward an Orthodox conversion, then you are also working with an Orthodox Rav and Beit Din. Your first source for what you should do prior to your conversion should come from them.</p>\n\n<p>That said, prior to your actual conversion, according to halacha, you have the legal status of being a non-Jew. You are not commanded to keep any of the 613 mitzvot (commandments) that a Jew is obligated to keep. And in fact, in regard to most of them, you should not be keeping them properly. Rather, you should be careful to observe the laws that are required of the children of Noach.</p>\n\n<p>The essence of this idea is found in the story about the disagreements between Yosef and his brothers and what ultimately resulted in his being sold into slavery and sent to Egypt. Both Yaacov Avinu and his beloved son, Yosef recognized that they were in a transitional period between being B'nai Noach and being B'nai Yisrael. Yosef, who received more complete instruction from his father about this, understood that during the transitional period, they still retained the halachic status of B'nai Noach. </p>\n\n<p>His older brothers were of the opinion that they had the legal status of being full-fledged B'nai Yisrael. A few of the practical areas of disagreement are mentioned in Torah. They revolve around kashrut and shechita, social interactions both personal and in business including matters of yichud, all matters of taharah, and even family inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>Those disagreements resulted in Yosef's brothers plotting to murder Yosef and ultimately selling him into slavery. But in the end, G-d revealed that just like Yosef's prophetic dream, where the dream elements representing his brothers and his father and mother would come to bow to the dream element representing Yosef, so too Yaacov Avinu and all his brothers were literally brought by Divine Providence to bow before Yosef HaTzadik, the primary representative of the King (Mishneh l'Melech).</p>\n\n<p>Through this bowing, they acknowledged that the halacha followed the view of Yosef regarding this transitional period, that the 'Kingship', the will of the King of the universe was with him.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that we are to remember this every time a communal sin offering is brought, meaning when we recite the sin offering each day in morning prayers. On Yom Kippur, when recounting the ten martyrs, we also bring this episode to mind. It is one of the central ideas of Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>These two links give some of the details of this concept:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/leff/archives/vayeish.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/leff/archives/vayeish.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.machondaniel.org/displayissue.asp?ArticleID=194#.VnQHsxHtly4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.machondaniel.org/displayissue.asp?ArticleID=194#.VnQHsxHtly4</a></p>\n\n<p>A prospective convert to Judaism, prior to completing the conversion, is also in this transitional period and acts according the halacha that was established by Yosef and upheld by the King of the Universe, the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Shabbat is something you should make a point of not keeping fully until you have completed your conversion. If you would find it embarrassing, you can make the violation in private.</p>\n\n<p>In regard to most, the wearing of a head covering is a 'good practice' which is found among all people, Jews and non-Jews. Torah says it is beneficial in helping one to remember G-d above and to live an upright life.</p>\n\n<p>When someone who is not yet Jewish observes the 613 mitzvot, meaning they take on an external appearance of looking Jewish, it leaves open the possibility for negative consequences.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a young Jewish woman may see you and not realize your status. She could overlook her true Bashert (the soul mate G-d intends for her) because her attention is on you. And what if you have a change of heart prior to actual conversion? At any point, prior to circumcision, immersion and standing before the Beit Din to accept upon yourself the yoke of the mitzvot, you can have a change of heart and say no thank you. It is not wrong for you. But for the poor Jewish woman, she has perhaps missed the opportunity of her life as a result of well intentioned 'false advertising' from you.</p>\n\n<p>If you feel a true love for the Jewish people, which according to Rabbi Hillel HaZaken is equated with keeping the entire Torah, you should delay observing the 613 commandments when there is a conflict between your obligation as a Ben Noach and the obligation of B'nai Yisrael until after your conversion is completed.</p>\n\n<p>The word, \"mitzvah\" (commandment), comes from the root 'tzavtah', which means connection. Any mitzvah, something you are actually commanded to observe, is your way of connecting properly to the Creator of us all. Torah tells us that it is far greater to fulfill what you are commanded to observe than to do something which you are not commanded to do on a voluntary basis. Doing those things which you commanded to do is fulfilling the will of the King of the Universe, the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>\n\n<p>As a non-Jew, you are actually commanded to fulfill the seven mitzvot of the children of Noach. When you properly observe these seven commandments, you are considered completely righteous before G-d and also have a share in the world to come.</p>\n\n<p>Even more than this, since you mention that you are at least learning about the commandment of tzitzit, you should be aware that one aspect of tzitzit that a Jew is to required to think of when performing this commandment is to recall all the commandments of G-d. For a Jew, that means they are to remember the 613 mitzvot of the Torah and the 7 Rabbinic mitzvot. But those 7 Rabbinic commandments are intended to parallel and remind us of the 7 commandments of Noach which G-d commanded on all mankind. The fulfillment of 613 mitzvot of the written Torah which are commanded upon the Jewish people together with the 7 commandments of Noach which are incumbent upon all mankind result in a revelation of G-d's kingship in the world. This is alluded to through the union of 613 and 7 which gives a sum of 620 (כתר), 'Crown', the Crown of G-d's kingship.</p>\n\n<p>Even more than this, we have the explicit saying of the Sages of Israel that, \"All sevenths are cherished\" before G-d. (כל השביעין חביבין) This includes all those non-Jews who fulfill the 7 commandments of Noach.</p>\n\n<p>At the very least, for you, if in fact you do ultimately convert to Judaism according to halacha, it is possible to think, 'how fortunate am I at this transitional time, that G-d has given me the opportunity to properly fulfill this aspect of the 7 mitzvot of Noach before taking on the new relationship of the 613 mitzvot incumbent upon the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Are you planning on adopting all the customs of a particular chassidic group (shtreimel, long beard, peyos, clothes etc.) upon the completion of your gerus? If so, then you might want to grow long peyos before your conversion. Or if you're planning on being Yeshivish and having very short peyos, an inch or two, then it may make sense to grow them to that length. However, even in these cases, you should wait until you are near completing your gerus, and definitely avoid doing so before checking with your supervising rabbi. </p>\n\n<p>If you're not planning on adopting certain chassidic or Yeshivish minhagim as mentioned above, or if you are not sure, then don't grow out your peyos (though of course you should avoid shaving the area). When you are converting, it is important to send a message to your supervising rabbi and beis din that you are a serious, responsible, and mentally well-balanced individual. When (as do some gerim and baalei teshuvah) you mix and match minhagim--for example, having an modern Orthodox way of dressing but wearing a long beard and peyos--it confuses people, because it is unusual to not follow one consistent set of minhagim. </p>\n\n<p>Conversion can be a long and tricky process, so it's best not to do anything very unusual or out of the mainstream while in the conversion process (such as wearing a \"yechi\" kippah, using a colorful tallis, or adopting a Yeminite nusach). I have heard a rabbi who has experience in counseling many gerim give this exact advice to gerim.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, there are certainly some people who grow long peyos despite not following all the minhagim of a particular chassidic group. See some of the photos <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/12/2014/rekindling-flame-neo-chassidus-brings-inner-light-torah-modern-orthodoxy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. However, if you want to do something like this is that is out of the mainstream, it is best to do so after your conversion. </p>\n\n<p>This is not conformity for conformity's sake; it is simply a matter of being prudent when trying to navigate a difficult process. After all, your job during the gerus process is to get used to and become committed to following all the basic halacha required of you, so that you can be completely observant once you convert. Though it may be natural, in the course of finding your spiritual path within Yiddishkeit, to pick and choose certain minhagim that attract you for whatever reason, it is best to avoid this, as least publicly, before your conversion is done.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, Yalqut Yosef often cites the Mishnah Berurah.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Lee's list is very comprehensive, and so i would consider my answer an addition to his.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking as a Sephardi Ba'al Teshuva myself, i have found a few things out that are rather annoying. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>That most Sephardic things are not translated into English, and it doesn't look like that will be changing anytime soon. And even the things that are translated into English are often translated by Ashkenazim. The Guide to Serving God by Abraham ben haRaMbaM was most recently translated by an Ashkenazi scholar, so you will see things like \"Shabbos.\" The same thing with the new translations of Chovoth haLevavoth</p></li>\n<li><p>That many of the talks about Sephardim come from an Ashkenazic perspective, or are given by Ashkenazified Sephardim. You ask an Ashkenazi Rabbi why Sephardim do things differently and a pretty common response will be \"they didn't have modern technology where they came from, or they weren't trained in science, and so they mistakingly do what they do.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So for your library i would start with a few books that would get you familiar with the development of Sephardi halakha, so you can understand where a lot of the differences stem from.</p>\n\n<p>A good English book on this is: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbinic Creativity in the Modern Middle East</strong> by Zvi Zohar\n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1441133291\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Rabbinic-Creativity-Modern-Middle-Library/dp/1441133291</a></p>\n\n<p>This book is ideal since details the gamut of Sephardim in their native countries, how they made halakhic rulings, and their philosopical outlooks.</p>\n\n<p>And since you are interested in Sephardi halakhic rulings, there is a new book series in development called </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mishnah Berurah Tiferet</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can read about it here: <a href=\"http://yeranenyaakov.blogspot.com/2014/02/mishnah-berurah-tiferet.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://yeranenyaakov.blogspot.com/2014/02/mishnah-berurah-tiferet.html</a></p>\n\n<p>My last recommendation is a book series called the <strong>Keter Shem Tob</strong> by dayyan Shemtob Gaguine, which is a compendium of all the Sephardic customs spanning the entire Middle East and the Western Sephardic communities of London and Amsterdam. This series doesn't get a lot of attention but is truly a great addition for any Sephardic Library. You can find more information about it here: <a href=\"http://www.ketershemtob.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ketershemtob.com/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One of the most important things that distinguishes a Sephardi Jew from his Ashkenazi brothers is the siddur from which he prays. There are many fine Nusach Edot HaMizrach siddurim out there, mainly in Hebrew but some in English as well. </p>\n\n<p>It is important and crucial to note that siddurim marked \"Sefard\" (as in the case of ArtScroll) are not Sephardi at all but actually Hasidic. Early Ashkenazi printers labeled siddurim used by Hasidim as \"Sefard\", because the nusach blended the nusach of the Arizal with the traditional Nusach Ashkenaz, giving the siddurim a Sephardi-taste. Further reading: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusach_Sefard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://esefarad.com/?p=24880\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So shop around and find a siddur you like; just make sure to look for \"Nusach Edot HaMizrach\" and not \"Sefard.\" As I said before, there are many fine siddurim; <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/siddurim-nusach-sefardi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">so many in Hebrew</a> but some in Hebrew-English like <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/orot-sephardic-shabbat-weekday-siddur-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orot siddurim</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I am not a Sephardi, but I think it's very important that Sephardim keep their nusach which is why I have added this answer among the other ones. I personally would recommend the <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/classic-koren-siddur-edot-mizrach/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koren-Sacks siddur</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/siddur-avodat-hashem-hashalem/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Avodat HaShalem</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/siddur-hashalem-hodaya/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur HaShalem Hodayah</a>, all three favorites among Sephardim I have known. </p>\n\n<p>I know I am a bit late as this question is two years old, but good luck in your journey. Our Sages of blessed memory teach us that a baal teshuvah is a very righteous and special person.</p>\n\n\n",

In the introduction to Sanhedrin, the Rambam explains several facets of this communication. He cites Exodus 33:11 as his source-text for that which Moshe was not thrust into a state of physical incapacity when he communicated with Hashem, as opposed to all other prophets who could not speak to Hashem while in control of their physical faculties.</p>\n\n<p>So the two verses are about two different points - one is a description of Moshe's clarity of communication with Hashem, while the other is a statement that even Moshe, being a created being, could not grasp Hashem's \"essence.\"</p>\n\n\n",

For example, there is the impulse to do a lot of quick positive mitzvos like count the omer, kiss the mezuze, give a penny, etc., based on the assumption that a higher number of mitzvos out of 613 is the end goal. Or, occasionally, there is a temptation to weigh mitzvos against each other based on time spent--should I do a quick aveira now in order to spend less time sinning later? (It's hard to think of examples of this, but I find it comes up for me a lot on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/21759/breaking-shabbos-to-keep-future-shabbosos\">Shabbos</a>, especially with the quasi-precedent of \" \"חלל עליו שבת אחת כדי שישמור שבתות הרבה\". Yishai also provided the example of doing a single aveira to acquire kosher food rather than have to eat treyfs, in which every bite is an aveira, although this points to an issue of number of aveiros rather than time.) </p>\n\n<p>A really good demonstration of what I'm talking about is actually <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/56563/any-point-to-avoiding-meat-and-shellfish-at-non-kosher-restaurants?rq=1\">this</a> question. It asks whether there is any point to eating something \"less\" treyf if you are already eating treyfs. For example, would there be a halachically-rigorous reason to abstain from pork in a non-kosher restaurant? If the answer is \"yes,\" then this points to \"number\" rather than \"time\" being the correct calculation. If \"no,\" that would point to \"time\" instead of \"number.\"</p>\n\n<p>An example that points to \"number\" instead of \"time\" is the idea that eating a bug is considered very bad because it violates many specific prohibitions per time unit (or per action).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I don't think we find anywhere in Torah that we would ever make a calculation like this.

There are also halachos of when one is permitted to stop learning Torah to perform mitzvot, but that is a different topic based on a different set of principles exclusive to Torah learning.</p>\n\n<p>We can't evaluate mitzvot at all. we do the best we can in whatever situation we find ourselves in. </p>\n\n<p>I heard it brought down that the reason that most mitzvot don't have a reward value attached to them in the Torah is so that we don't make the same calculations you are trying to do. </p>\n\n<p>I understand why you are asking and it would be nice if we could know the value of the mitzvot to figure this out, but here is where we must have emunah and do the best we can.</p>\n\n<p>There is a story told about the Vilna Gaon who had an apostate Jew at his table. the Jew was about to drink a glass of water when the Vilna Gaon stopped him and asked him to make a bracha. the Jew was shocked \"don't you know that I don't keep the Torah at all, what difference would it make if I say or skip this beracha?\" the Vilna Gaon answered \"Hashem judges each action we make, even down to each and every beracha, no matter what else we do\".</p>\n\n<p>I suggest learning Torah every day and coming up with a plan of doing the mitzvot in a way that complements your relationship with Hashem. don't worry, about how much when, just as long as you are growing and making your relationship real.</p>\n\n<p>Torah is not a Zero sum game. it is the one truth for all and unique to each and every one of us!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R. Chaim Volozhiner (Derech Hachaim 1:21) writes that each sin causes a flaw in your soul. The punishment that is the consequence of this flaw heals it. The Derekh Hashem similarly (1:4:5) \"sin detracts from one's perfection\". The Michtav Me'Eliyahu explains the expression \"Aveira goreres aveira\" by saying that after repeatedly doing a given sin, it becomes part of one's nature, so that no conscious decision is required next time the situation arises.</p>\n\n<p>Yishmael was repaid in terms of \"ba'asher hu sham -- as he was there\". The way your soul stands at that moment is the direct cause of reward or punishment. Notice that this implies a major statement. We are not judged for what we did, we pay the consequences for who we are. As the midrash states, one of the first three questions the A-lmighty will ask as part of the final judgment is, \"Why did you not fulfill your potential?\" Man is judged based upon the gap between reality and potential. Mitzvos were given as vehicles for closing this gap.</p>\n\n<p>The reward of a mitzvah therefore cannot be measured by the type of mitzvah, its outcome in this world -- such as whether the recipient received $1 or matching funds brought it up to $2, or pretty much any other criterion human beings can get a handle on. Or as the mishnah puts it, \"be [as] aware of a \"light\" mitzvah as with a weighty one, for you don't know the reward for [each of the] mitzvos.\" (Avos 2:1)</p>\n\n<p>Which forces us to conclude that even \"according to the pain so is the reward\" (Avos 5:25) is a derivative idea. (Or else we would know which mitzvah is greater, constradicting the other mitzvah; but also the verse about Yismael forces this conclusion.) The greater the effort and sacrifice, the bigger the change in \"ba'asher hu sham -- as you are there\", when being judged.</p>\n\n<p>Human justice operates very differently, though. We cannot know the content of a mind or a soul, even our own, well enough to judge it. A court instead does judge the deed.</p>\n\n<p>For the same reason, we \"don't know the reward for [each of the] mitzvos\".

Therefore he only put down himself.</p>\n\n<p>It is obvious that Satmar still considers itself a Chasidus and still claims to follow earlier generations of Chassidic Rebbes. But this famous comment is meant to portray that we aren't following the same brand of Chassidus practiced back then. </p>\n\n<p>The early Chassidic Sefarim have aspects of Avodas Hashem that people today don't relate to. Many directives are addressing those who are constantly in a state of heavenly awareness, and describe how to relate to mundane matters with that perspective. There is little doubt that Chassidus has adapted to the later generations.

Others have said (don't recall right now whom) that just like the period of Geonim and Rishonim passed, the period of Talmidei Baal Shem passed as well. However, this doesn't either mean to disregard it, just like we don't disregard the Geonim and Rishonim. But it's meant to keep perspective and understand that although we might be following on their heals we aren't there anymore.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\n<a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?152863&page=22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a Drasha</a> from R.

In the biography by M. M. Yoshor (<em>The Chafetz Chaim – The Life and Works of Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan of Radin</em>) we are told:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the years after the first world war, Poland, successfully resisting\n  Bolshevik aggression, was gradually restored to peace. Soon the Polish\n  yeshivas were established again in their former homes, although this\n  restoration took longer for those rabbis and students who came back\n  from Russian Exile. The kollel (academy for young married scholars) in\n  Kovno-Slobodka also re-opened. One of the first 10 members of this\n  resurrected <em>kollel</em> was Rav David <em>HaKohen</em> Leibovitz, a grandson of\n  the Chafetz Chaim's brother. When the Chafetz Chaim himself returned\n  from his years of exile in Russia, Reb David came to visit him. In the\n  course of their conversation, he told his great-uncle that \"Torah had\n  returned to its home\" – the <em>kollel</em> in Kovno had re-opened – and that\n  he was one of its members. The Chafetz Chaim wanted to know what the\n  program of study was. Reb David replied that the main subject was the\n  Takmud tractate <em>Shabbos</em> – and the concerted study by the group was\n  helpful in clarifying many important areas of <em>halacha</em> that are dealt\n  with in the tractate. The Chafetz Chaim was surprised. </p>\n  \n  <p>\"Reb David, my dear friend,\" he said, \"you have to realize that the\n  days of the Redemption are not far off for us. Soon our righteous\n  Messiah will appear. When this great hope of ours is fulfilled, and\n  the <em>Beis HaMikdash</em> is rebuilt and the <em>Kohanim</em> return to minister\n  and serve at the Sanctuary, people are going to come and ask questions\n  about the Sanctuary and the holy matters connected with it. <strong>You are\n  a <em>Kohen</em>, Reb David, aren't you? So a duty lies on you to study and\n  know the multitude of halachos concerning holy offerings. You have to\n  become fully versed in them, so that you will know how to give\n  instructions and answers for actual practice – what people should do\n  and should not do.</strong> As Scripture says, <em>They shall teach Yaakov your\n  rules, and Yisrael your Torah</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 33:10).\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Reb David, taken aback in turn, replied, \"But what about the laws of\n  the holy <em>Shabbos</em>? The <em>halachos</em> of <em>Shabbos</em> and the 39 categories\n  of work forbidden on the holy day are like mountains hanging by a\n  thread!\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Chafetz Chaim answered simply, \"For the laws of <em>Shabbos</em> there is\n  the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>!\" (p. 445-446, emphasis added.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This was also the opinion of <strong>Rav <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Yitzchak HaKohein Kook</a></strong> (1865-1935).

This institute of religious higher learning was intended, as its declared intentions stated, to study “the talmudic order of Kodshim, the regulation of worship in the Temple, the commandments that relate to the Land of Israel and the religious laws relating to the state.”</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The yeshiva was founded on the basis of the expectation that the movement of national revival led by Zionism, which was characterized by a disconnection from religion, would rapidly return to the fold of sanctity, the completion of ultimate redemption and the building of the Temple. As is clear from his pamphlet “Sefatei Cohen,” (Lips of a Priest) in which he described the goals of the new yeshiva, Kook believed that the revival of the Hebrew nation, despite the fact that it constituted primarily a secular initiative by Jews who rejected religious authority, was nevertheless intended to secure a sublime spiritual purpose. It would ultimately emerge that the final purpose of this revival was to bring the religious redemption of the Jewish people, the zenith of which is the building of the Temple:</p>\n  \n  <p>“The anticipation of seeing the priests at their worship and the Levites on their stand and Israel in their presence — this is the foundation that bears this entire revival.”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>According to Rabbi Kook, this day was steadily emerging, and preparations must therefore be made. Torat Cohanim yeshiva was thus intended to attend to the practical preparation of priests and Levites for their worship in the Temple, based on the acute messianic expectation that the Temple would indeed be built “speedily and in our days.”</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rabbi Kook taught the tractate of Kodshim in the context of this hope that the sacrifices would be reinstated, and this seems to have formed the background for the establishment of Torat Cohanim yeshiva.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A tip of my hat to <a href=\"/u/2\">Isaac Moses</a> for this link to <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org?oldid=695436784#Growth_cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>, which says human hair typically grows six inches (fifteen cm) in a year.)</p>\n\n<p>If you have a medical condition that prevents your hair from growing, consult a medical professional. If someone is cutting them without your knowledge while you're asleep, sleep alone and lock your bedroom door.</p>\n\n<p>You mention curly, though. Some people's hair is curly; others have to curl it. I recommend curlers (also called hair rollers), not because I have personal experience with them, but because they have been quite popular for curling hair for many years so I assume they must work pretty well. However, please consult your rabbi before using curlers: I don't know whether they are considered \"women's garb\" of the sort forbidden to men.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>My hair is curly and i could grow peyoth all day long if i wanted to.

Rather, if you want to curl your payos, use your finger. For the proper method to do this, we asked a Rabbi with long payos. He wrote us the following: \"Wet the payos and comb them out horizontally across the forehead. Then, take the forefinger of the hand of whichever side you are doing, stick the forefinger from above in between the hair and the forehead, and push it towards the roots of the payos as far as you can comfortably get it. Then, with the other hand, curl the rest of the hair around your forefinger in the down direction, trying to keep it as in order as possible. Hold it that way just for a moment, and then gently try to remove the forefinger without messing up the curl. Once it's out, don't touch the curl; let it dry that way. Do this once each weekday morning, and maybe once again later in the day if you want (optional), and hopefully it will start curling naturally by itself. \"If you ever cut your payos one time too short, then about five months later you will have a growth of hair coming from the top that will not go together with the rest of the payos, at least for a couple of years. Many have this problem. I don't have a clear solution for it.\"\n  <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/206/Q4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr Somayach - Ask the Rabbi</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow\n  the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Q - If the famine was supposed to last another 5 years, what would sowing seeds accomplish?</p>\n\n<p>A - Rash\"i (among others) citing Tosefta Sotah* explains that when Jacob arrived, the famine stopped.</p>\n\n<p>OK, that explains what happened, except for some puzzling contradictions:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>After Jacob dies, Joseph says, in Genesis 50:21:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעַתָּה֙ אַל־תִּירָ֔אוּ אָנֹכִ֛י אֲכַלְכֵּ֥ל אֶתְכֶ֖ם\n  וְאֶֽת־טַפְּכֶ֑ם וַיְנַחֵ֣ם אוֹתָ֔ם וַיְדַבֵּ֖ר עַל־לִבָּֽם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Now don't fear; I will sustain you, and your little ones.’\n  And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Supposedly, the famine has ended long ago. Why does Joseph say \"I will sustain you\". If there's no famine, the family has food and doesn't have to rely on Joseph to sustain them. The family was wealthy and there was food available. Is this some implication that after Jacob died the remaining years of the famine returned?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Even though the famine ended when Yaakov gave the bracha to Par'o (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&pgnum=608\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>) they still needed food during the growing season and they needed seeds to plant for the new season. Up until now, the famine had been so severe that they could not even manage a seed stock. Thus, had Yosef not provided another growing season worth of food, they would have starved. Had he not provided a seed stock, they would have had nothing to plant for the growing season and they could not have survived afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>I recall seeing some meforshim also point out that after Yaakov died, the famine resumed and the remaining five years of the famine were completed. I do not recall where I saw this mentioned. Other meforshim speak of the bracha being brought by Yaakov to end the famine early as I explain below.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in Va'ychi 50:21 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is not to be taken as meaning that Yosef took his brothers' chief\n  worry to be about the possibility of their material support being\n  withdrawn or reduced. such a supposition is already refuted by וינחם\n  אותם וידבר על לבם What this verse means is rather: \"Once again have no\n  fear that our father's death will make the slightest difference in my\n  feelings towards you. The proof will be in your hands every day that I\n  am and will remain exactly the same as before\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong> I should also point out that a dream interpretation is not a fixed prediction. It is usually what will happen if circumstances do not change. For example, a prediction of doom could be canceled if people do teshuvah. Here, the famine was interrupted because Yaakov Avinu brought a bracha to Egypt. Often, the dream is sent so that the dreamer can change the situation in order to fix a problem. The difficulty with this is that the attempt to change matters could cause the dream to come true.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The famine was not limited to Egypt. Other lands had to come and buy food from Egypt. Although the famine eased up in Egypt in Yaakov's merit, there's no reason to think it stopped all around.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Egypt is inherently different in that it doesn't depend on rain. Yaakov just blessed Pharaoh that the Nile should overflow. But nothing changed all around.</p>\n\n<p>Yosef told his brothers to bring Yaakov to Egypt because the famine will last another five years. This was referring to Kenaan.</p>\n\n<p>Although we might understand why the famine paused, Pharaoh and certainly the Egyptian common folk would think he was wrong.</p>\n\n\n",

Since this is a matter of a person's character that you cannot simply test, one solution is to only eat from shochetim that one knows personally and trusts. In old-world shtetls where everyone in the village knew everyone else, this was a common practice. In towns where chassidim lived, they often insisted that the town shochet be a chossid to ensure that he would be G-d fearing. In today's world of industrial mass-production, the consumer often has no idea what kind of person has performed the shechita on their meat. Therefore some Lubavitchers, although certainly not all, rely on some admittedly superficial indicators to help ensure that the shochet has <em>yiras shamayim</em>. Studying chassidus and going to mikvah every morning demonstrate that they are putting in an effort to advance in their worship of G-d, and refusing to cave to the pressure from American society to shave one's beard demonstrates that they are not easily swayed from their convictions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I heard that there was some advancement in knife technology and the Rebbe (or a predecessor) saw that it reduced the consequences of failing to check and re sharpen the knife so he decreed that he would only eat meat slaughtered with this type of knife.

    "content": "# How did Yakov know the wagons are connected to Egla Arufa?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As we know, Yakov was 100% sure that Yosef was alive when he saw the wagons that Yosef sent. Rashi there explains that the wagons , Agola, are the same words as Eglah (as in Egla Arufa) and that was the last topic Yosef and Yaakov were learning when he disappeared. </p>\n\n<p>I'm curious how did Yakov know that the wagons were a sign for egla arufa? Was it just word association in that a Calf and Wagon both use the same words? Who thinks like that? Was it more than that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi doesn't say that Yaakov figured it out from seeing the wagons. What he says is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סימן מסר להם במה היה עוסק כשפירש ממנו בפרשת עגלה ערופה זהו שאמר וירא את העגלות אשר שלח יוסף ולא אמר אשר שלח פרעה</p>\n<p>He gave them a sign – with what had he been engaged when he separated from him? With the topic of <em>eglah arufah</em>. This is what it says \"and he saw the wagons that Yosef sent\", and it does not say that Pharaoh sent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It says that he gave <em>them</em> a sign. It sounds like Yosef gave the brothers a sign, namely the last topic he had studied with Yaakov, and the brothers presented that to Yaakov. In this case, Yaakov didn't need to make any connections; it was all spelled out for him.</p>\n<p>This is even more clear in the Midrash from which Rashi's comments derive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' לוי בשם ר' יוחנן בר שאול אמר להם אם יאמין לכם הרי מוטב ואם לאו אתם אומרים לו בשעה שפרשתי ממך לא בפרשת עגלה ערופה הייתי עוסק הה\"ד וירא את העגלות ותחי רוח</p>\n<p>R. Levi in the name of R. Yochanan Bar Shaul – he said to them: \"If he believes you, fine. But if not, you should tell him that at the time that I separated from you was I not engaged in the topic of <em>eglah arufah</em>?\" That is what is written \"and he saw the wagons and his spirit was restored\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this Yosef explicitly told the brothers about the last topic he had studied, and he told them to furnish that as proof that Yosef was alive. There was thus no \"hint\", and Yaakov didn't have to guess anything. It presumably didn't have anything to do with the actual wagons that Yosef sent. The point about the common word seems to be for the readers. The Torah is telling <strong>us</strong> that not only did Yosef send physical wagons, he also sent another form of <em>agalot</em>, namely the report about his last study topic being <em>eglah arufah</em>, and when Yaakov heard that he was convinced that Yosef was still alive.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/parsha/rabbi-weinreb-on-parsha/rabbi_weinrebs_parsha_column_vayigash_12_7/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Weinreb</a> discusses the question and asks what is is about egla arufa that causes Rashi to make the connection to the wagons. Is it only a word play and what would be the message that Yosef is trying to convey?</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Weinreb explains that the message that Yoseph conveyed with these wagons was that he had learned the lesson of personal responsibility for everything that he was involved in. The meforshim explain that Yaakov saw that Yosef had not just sent the wagons of Par'o to get them (from the markings on the wagons) but had ensured that the symbold of avodas zarah had been removed from them. Had he just ordered wagons from Par'o's stables, the normal avodas zarah marking would have been left on. It was the complete setup of the wagons that showed Yaakov that Yosef had been personally involved with sending them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rashi wonders what it was about the wagons, the agalot, that convinced\n  Jacob and revived his spirit. Rashi tells us that these wagons were a\n  sign sent by Joseph to Jacob, recalling the subject of their learned\n  conversation when they first parted ways so long ago.</p>\n  \n  <p>That subject is the ritual of the “calf [Hebrew egla] with a broken\n  neck,” the details of which are described in the first several verses\n  of Deuteronomy 21. Joseph was apparently confident that Jacob would\n  see the connection between the word for wagons, agalot, and the word\n  for calf, egla.</p>\n  \n  <p>The reader of Rashi’s words cannot help but ask with astonishment: Is\n  this some game, some bizarre wordplay? Agala calls to mind egla? What\n  connection can there be between the ritual of the calf and Jacob’s\n  parting words of instruction to Joseph before sending him off on his\n  mission to his brothers, never to see him again until this moment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the Kli Yakar explains, if the elders of the city are not\n  hospitable to the wayfarers who frequent the city, the criminals who\n  populate the environs of the city will assume that this wayfarer is of\n  no import, and they will therefore take liberties with him, even to\n  the point of shedding his blood. Were these villains to observe that\n  the wayfarer was significant enough to the elders of the city to be\n  treated graciously, they would have refrained from harming him.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the nature of responsibility. The elders are not suspected of\n  actual murder. But if they treat their guests improperly, they set in\n  motion a process by which those guests are dehumanized, becoming easy\n  prey to malicious persons. That is how far the demands of\n  responsibility extend.</p>\n  \n  <p>When Jacob sent Joseph on his dangerous mission, continues Kli Yakar,\n  he escorted Joseph part of the way. By doing so, he was teaching\n  Joseph the lesson of the “calf with a broken neck,” the lesson of the\n  importance of escorting the traveler, thus demonstrating the human\n  value of that traveler. Joseph signaled to his father that he learned\n  that lesson well and knew the responsibility entailed in dealing with\n  one’s fellow.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jacob realized that it was Joseph who personally had a hand in sending\n  the wagons of Pharaoh, thereby escorting his brothers part of the way\n  back to Canaan. Jacob took note of those wagons and therefore knew\n  that Joseph had learned that a minor gesture of considerate behavior\n  to others may have long-term consequences. He signaled that he had\n  learned the crucial importance of taking responsibility for all one’s\n  actions, however insignificant they may appear. And so, “The spirit of\n  their father Jacob revived.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Agalot and egla are not just words in a linguistic game. Rather, they\n  allude to the profound lesson about personal responsibility, which is\n  the basis of the requirement of the elders to proclaim their innocence\n  of murder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Pshat of the words are that although at first Yaacov didn't believe that Yosef was still alive and even a ruler, he saw many wagons arrive that did not originate from him and were obviously being sent from elsewhere. This opened his mind to the idea and he let it sink in.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal are saying that in these words Agalos there is a hint to something else that transpired, that in addition to having sent the wagons he <em>also</em> sent along this message of Egla Arufa. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi's wording supports this understanding, that the Remez is that he sent a verbal message.</p>\n\n<p>In addition we can understand this that the wagons, being called Agalos, served as a reminder of Egla Arufa rather than a hint. Yaakov had escorted Yosef and he therefore should understand that it stands to reason, and he should allow himself to believe, that nothing bad happened to Yosef (in the long run).</p>\n\n<p>An idea i once heard, similar to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66378/how-did-yakov-know-the-wagons-are-connected-to-egla-arufa/66396#comment185707_66378\">IsaacKotlicky</a>, is that the Egyptians invented the wagon and would not have let it out, which is why we find that Yosef had to have Paaroh's permission to send them. Up until this point we only find mention of carrying things on camel back. This is why Eliezer needed ten camels. Therefore, the wagons were both, a hint and a sign that someone with high connections had sent them.</p>\n\n\n",

FWIW, I've seen on the same placement on my Smart Phone Tikkun app as well as in the Hertz Chumash. I can't imagine that they are all wrong.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Trop marks are traditionally always placed on the accented syllable EXCEPT Yetiv and Telisha Gedola which are always on the first letter, and Telisha Ketana, Pashta, Zarka, and Segol which are always on the last letter. In those words, you have to just know where the accent goes. (Many printers nowadays print a <em>second</em> trop mark on the accented syllable in those cases.)</p>\n\n<p>Your friend is right: the word is <em>BA-nu</em>. It is past tense. The present tense form would be <em>ba-IM</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The brother are telling Pharoh why they <em>came</em> to Egypt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>That word is always pronounced with emphasis on the second-to-last syllable (<em>mil'el</em>) and is past tense. (If it had a prefixed <em>vav</em> and were <em>mil'ra</em> (emphasis on the last syllable), it'd be future tense. Maybe that's what you're thinking of.)</p>\n\n<p>The <em>segol</em> cantillation mark is always written on the last letter. Most copies of <em>Chumash</em> follow the standard practice of marking a <em>mil'el</em> word with an extra <em>segol</em> on the emphasized letter, but some do not.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14036&st=&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Minchas Shay</em> notes</a> that the preceding word has a <em>zarka</em> on the last letter only. (He mentions this several other times in <em>Tanach</em>, and it's possible he had a general rule of writing only one <em>zarka</em>, even though we duplicate the mark on the stressed syllable. Alternatively, <a href=\"/u/759\">Double AA</a> suggests in a comment that the <em>Minchas Shay</em> meant there's no <em>meseg</em> on the word.) Perhaps the editors of the version you were using saw the <em>Minchas Shay</em>, got confused by it, and left the first <em>segol</em> off of this word.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The trope is correctly placed because whether the accent falls on the first syllable (where it belongs) or even on the last syllable, there is no <em>grammatical</em> change to the meaning of the word.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the accent were to fall on the penultimate syllable (second from last) then the word would change its meaning, and this occurs in Exodus 10:26.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OoFdF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OoFdF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a><br>\nThe accent on the penultimate syllable forces us to read the suffix <em>-nu</em> as a first person (plural) possessive adjective, and therefore to read the word as noun (or an infinitive, which is a verbal noun). </p>\n\n<p>In other words, when the Hebrew letters <strong>באנו</strong> appear together, the word can have one of two meanings depending on where the accent falls. If the accent falls on the first (or even the last) syllable, the word is the qal perfect (first person plural) of the verb <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?bn=21&page=1&source=Psalm11918%2Eorg&strongs=H935&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בּוֹא</a></strong>. However, if the accent falls on the penultimate syllable, we are forced to read the word as the infinitive construct, but now the suffix becomes possessive, and the word is now understood as a verbal noun (<em>our coming</em>) instead of the simple verb in the first person plural (<em>we came</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the cantillation of the verse (based on logical arrangement) appears as follows. </p>\n\n<p>Please click to enlarge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Aq3qJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Aq3qJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Please note that the word <strong>בָּאנוּ</strong> appears early in the verse, and marks off the principal division of the first half of the verse. But there are also several subsequent logical divisions of the verse that follow. Each of these divisions (and subdivisions) are marked off by disjunctive accents, which CANNOT be stronger than the accent assigned to the word <strong>בָּאנוּ</strong> until we arrive to the mid-point of the verse, which is marked by the Athnach.</p>\n\n<p>Since our word in question marks off the first logical division of the first half of the verse, it must carry the most powerful disjunctive accent until we arrive to the Athnach, <strong>but that disjunctive accent cannot have its stress on the penultimate syllable</strong>, otherwise the <em>grammatical</em> meaning of <strong>בָּאנוּ</strong> will change (for the reasons already mentioned in the paragraphs above). </p>\n\n<p>The ONLY disjunctive accent that can fit here, and that does NOT have the accent on the penultimate syllable, is Segoletta. (The next qualified disjunctive accent is the Zarqa, which is too weak, not to mention that the Zarqa had already appeared on the word preceding <strong>בָּאנוּ֒</strong>.) </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the remaining disjunctive accents carry their stress on the penultimate syllable, and such use of these accents would change the grammatical meaning of the word (for reasons already noted ). For these reasons, the Masoretic editors had to use the Segoletta, which is postpositive (and so falls on the last syllable), and therefore does not change the <em>grammatical</em> meaning of <strong>בָּאנוּ֒</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Pronunciation in MO schools",
    "content": "# Pronunciation in MO schools\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am curious about the Hebrew pronunciation taught in many Modern Orthodox schools. It doesn't seem to conform to real Israeli pronunciation, nor is it the  \"standard Yiddish\" or Polish pronunciation used in Yeshivish schools. </p>\n\n<p>The schools in question are careful to use Tov, not Sov, and kamatz and patach sound the same. Other than that, they seem confused. I am unsure as to the proper use of Shva, pronunciation of tzeirei, and whether other Keriah rules are used or ignored.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know the correct way to encourage students in these MO schools to say Shema. Which rules should they follow? When should they pronounce a shva na? What other rules are used or ignored?</p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of this question, let's assume that all accepted pronunciations (eg. Sephardic, Ashkenazic, Yemenite) are equally valid. Let's also assume that Shema is meant to be said in the original Hebrew with a special emphasis on pronouncing each word correctly.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>\"Modern Orthodox,\" like its superset, \"Orthodox,\" does not refer to a particular ethno-historial line of tradition, like \"Yemenite\" or \"Galician,\" or to a particular centrally-led movement, like Chabad or Conservative. As such, it can't possibly have a well-defined notion of a particular tradition of pronunciation. A teacher in a MO school (or any other not-otherwise-specified Orthodox achool) should follow whatever pronunciation rules are dictated by the school's leadership. If there aren't any, the teacher should probably revert to his/her own tradition and best understanding of correct pronunciation.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>So the way i'm interpreting your question is as follows: The way that the MO school teaches Hebrew isn't consistent, it seems to take a little from here, a little from there, and kind of plops it all together. And so you want to teach a consistent Hebrew pronunciation.</p>\n\n<p>So if your goal is to teach a consistent pronunciation, you basically have 5 to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>The Ashkenazi pronunciation. You are probably familiar with this one. א and ע only serve the purpose as vowel holders, ח and כ share the same sound, as do ק and כּ. The patach and kamatz are distinguished as are the ת and תּ.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli pronunciation. The Israeli pronunciation is interesting because originally the council in charge of it tried to enforce the pronunciation to be modern Sephardic, in that one should distinguish between ח and כ and א and ע. Unfortunately this never spread to the general public. You are probably well aware of how Israeli Hebrew pronounces the letters, so i won't go into that. But i will say that Israeli Hebrew generally ignores the pronunciation the \"sheva/shewa\" na in lots of instances. A few examples would be: when the sheva/shewa follows the qamats vowel and other long vowels. When there is a sheva/shewa underneath a letter that has a dagesh in it, a good example would be a recent blessing said during Hanukkah.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IxOoB.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IxOoB.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a> </p>\n\n<p>The second to last word should properly be pronounced \"ba-ze-man\" rather than Baz-man. Ashkenazi Hebrew often fails to follow these sheva/sehwa rules as well.\nSo be aware that if you choose this pronunciation, that built into the system is certain bad grammatical issues.</p>\n\n<p>The Modern Sephardic pronunciation. This is a stripped down amalgamation of several pronunciations and is the most widely used amongst Sephardim today. They distinguish between ח and כ. And between א and ע.  They also distinguish between כ and כּ, and ב and בּ. They do not distinguish between patach and qamatz.</p>\n\n<p>The Old Mizrahi pronunciation. This pronunciation crops up amongst certain community members that recently immigrated to Israel or to other countries. Good examples would be people from Iraq, Tunisia, and certain other parts of the Middle East. This pronunciation distinguishes between all the בגד כפת letters when dageshim are present. It also distinguishes between כ and ק , plus ט and תּ. It is consistent with use of the sheva/shewa, and pronounces ו as a w rather than a v. If you would like to hear how this pronunciation works you can see a video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSAu-wBvYHg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. The video is done by Moshe Chabusha who is a famous Iraqi Hazzan. For a proper tutorial on the Shema using this pronunciation, with some Mizrahi melodies, you can see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh2ppJ2GzFk&feature=youtu.be&\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this video</a>, which is also by Moshe Chabusha.</p>\n\n<p>The final one is Yemenite Pronunciation. The Yemenite is similar to the Old Mizrahi pronunciation in that it distinguishes between all the בגד כפת letters and pronounces the ו as a w. What sets it apart from the Old Mizrahi pronunciation is that they have a different set of vowels, the some vowels more closely matching the Ashkenazi pronunciation, and others just being unique.</p>\n\n<p>My advice to you would be to answer a few questions for yourself. Is your goal to have these kids pronounce the shema in the way that Jews originally did? If so, choose the Old Mizrahi or the Yemenite pronunciations. If your goal is to teach them a Hebrew they will use in Israel. Then teach them Israeli Hebrew, with all of its pluses and minuses. If the kids are learning Hebrew because \"You're Jewish! You should be doing Jewishy type things! Just don't ask us what the point of a made up Hebrew pronunciation system is!\" Then it doesn't really matter. If you want these kids to go into Ashkenazi Yeshivoth where Yiddish is the main language, then why not give them the Ashkenazi pronunciation so they stand out less when they get there? If you want them to have a proper pronunciation that still sounds similar to other forms of Hebrew, then teach them Old Mizrahi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Modern Orthodox pronunciation that you described seems to be an approximation of Israeli Hebrew, but with a slight local accent, and with ר pronounced like English R. In other words, Israeli Hebrew simplified for English speaking students and teachers.</p>\n<p>This pronunciation is likely used because of the emphasis on Zionism in Modern Orthodoxy, which leads to affiliated schools focusing on teaching students to communicate with Israelis, which is difficult with a strong traditional Ashkenazic accent. However, it isn’t practical to educate teachers in a perfect Israeli accent. This “MO pronunciation” is the result.</p>\n<p>This accent has zero focus on grammatical rules, and individual accents can vary. Thus, one teacher might pronounce Segol and Tzereh like in Modern Hebrew (eh or ey, depending on the word), while others might unconditionally pronounce them the Modern Ashkenazic way (ey). Dagesh Chazzak is ignored entirely. Shva is inconsistent. The location of emphasis on words can vary between teachers. Things like that.</p>\n<p>There’s no “ideal” version of this pronunciation. However, if there were one, I’d say it would be just like Israeli Hebrew except with an English R for ר.</p>\n<p>The problem with using this accent for all Hebrew subjects, including teaching Torah and educating children in Tefillah, is that it’s important—especially when leining and reading Shema—to pronounce every word and letter as carefully and accurately as possible. This accent isn’t meant for that. It would be great if, for such subjects, you could use an accent that differentiates most letters (e.g. Mizrahi, Iraqi) without confusing the students.</p>\n<p>Note that not all Modern Orthodox schools use the same standard pronunciation. I am answering based on my experience in Modern Orthodox schools, which I think mirrors yours in this regard. (To those who asked for the definition of Modern Orthodoxy—absolute Torah observance, with a specific emphasis on interacting with the outside world while fully maintaining Torah values).</p>\n\n\n",

AFAIK, the moon has no moisture. Do they mean dew at night? That doesn't come from the moon, and dew is not damaging from what I know.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p><strong>The Idea in Brief</strong></p>\n\n<p>The verse is not speaking about any harm from the sun (or even the moon), but instead speaks to harm that occurs night and day; in this respect, the psalmist speaks to divine protection 24/7, which encompasses the time period during the time of the sun (daytime) and time of the moon (nighttime).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Tehellim</em> were sung, and the way this verse was sung in this Psalm had placed a <em>logical</em> pause after the first word according to the system of cantillation.

That is, the first word of the verse is marked by the Athnach disjunctive accent, and therefore forms the main division of the verse. In this regard, the remainder of the verse is modifying the first word, because the verse words stands alone in the first division because of the Athnach.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>At this juncture, the following paragraphs explain why cantillation is important to understand how they relate to the meaning of verses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The role and meaning of cantillation in Hebrew Scripture</strong></p>\n\n<p>During the 19th Century, the Bible scholar Dr. William Wickes reintroduced and brought new perspectives to light concerning Hebrew cantillation, and how this cantillation was in direct relation to the logical parsing and arrangement of the verses of the Hebrew Bible. That is to say, the cantillation not only provided the <em>musical</em> accompaniment, but set the <em>logical</em> arrangement of Hebrew verse. In this regard, Dr. Wickes writes the following in the introduction to the first volume of his book based on his observations from the Talmud and other rabbinic sources.</p>\n\n<p>Please click this image to enlarge or <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/treatiseonacpoet00wickuoft#page/n17/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>view the source online</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Y2Fvn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/a7Dqsm.png\" alt=\"This image provides a quote from the book written by Dr. William Wickes in the 19th Century. In the first chapter of the first volume of this book, Dr. Wickes writes that Hebrew Scripture was written according to a system of verse divisions, but these divisions were logical. These logical divisions were assigned musical annotations, which we \"see\" as Hebrew cantillation.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this regard, the written cantillation provided both the musical <em>and</em> logical arrangement of the Scriptures based on a system of divisions (or dichotomy), for which Dr. Wickes <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/treatiseonacpoet00wickuoft#page/n39/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes an entire chapter</a>. In summary, this system of divisions and sub-divisions enabled the listener of the Scripture to (<em>a</em>) enjoy the Scripture <em>musically</em>, (<em>b</em>) understand the Scripture <em>logically</em>, and (<em>c</em>) memorize the Scripture <em>systematically</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The conclusions of Wickes were affirmed by the late Jewish scholar, Profesor Israel Yeivin, from Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The following source citation (below) comes from Page 172 of his book, <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/089130374X\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah</a></em> (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 1980).</p>\n\n<p>Please click on the image below to enlarge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JCPxB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JCPxBm.jpg\" alt=\"This image is a quote from the book written by Professor Israel Yeivin of Hebrew University, who affirms and therefore validates the findings of Dr. Wickes.\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Simplified Version of the Division</strong></p>\n\n<p>Based on the explanations noted in the previous paragraphs, the following is my own rendering of the <em>logical</em> division of this verse in order to better explain the idea. Please note that the first word of the verse (where the main division occurs) is modified by the remainder of the verse, which is also sub-divided. This second part (with the sub-division) becomes the <em>logical</em> complement of the first word.</p>\n\n<p>Please click on the image below to enlarge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6q9cG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kQ9X8m.png\" alt=\"This image is a simplified version of how the logical structure of the verse. That is, the verse explains how one phrase modifies another phrase, and how those two phrases modify the first word of the verse, which stands alone because of the division made by the Athnach upon that word.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So, based on the cantillation division -- marked by the Great <em>R’bhîa</em> (ְבִיעַ גָּדוֹל) and Little <em>R’bhîa</em> (רְבִיעַ קָטוֹן) -- the phrase mentioning the moon complemented the phrase mentioning the sun, and this entire clause, in turn, modified the first word of the verse (<em>day</em>).</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the gist of the verse is that the Psalmist was singing about the experience of divine protection 24/7, because the “day” is defined as the time during the presence of the sun, which is complemented by the time during the presence of the moon. This time encompasses what the Psalmist calls a “day.” </p>\n\n<p>Therefore it is neither the sun or the moon that is hurting anyone, but instead it appears that harm is the implicit subject. This interpretation also appears in the Targum, but is more explicit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Targum Psalms</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Targum Psalms makes it clear that the sun and the moon are not the subjects of the verb, but the subject instead is the harm that occurs during the mornings and nights. Please click on the image below to enlarge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IMP22.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LFq18m.png\" alt=\"This image is a quote of the verse in Aramaic taken from the Targum Psalms.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>My own literal word-for-word translation from the Aramaic is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Tehellim</em> 121:6</strong> (Targum)<br>\n  <sup>6</sup> In daytime during the ruling sun, the mornings will not strike you nor the nights during the ruling of the moon in the nighttime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Please note that the Targum moves the emphasis away from the sun or the moon as the subject of the verb, and instead implies harm <em>during the times of the mornings</em> (when the sun is present) and <em>during the times of nights</em> (when the moon is present). The idea here then is divine protection 24/7. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Targum Psalms was composed before the 5th Century, according to <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14248-targum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>the Jewish Encyclopedia</em></a>. Several years later in the 9th and 10th centuries, the Masoretes codified the Masoretic Text, which ascribed cantillation marks to the Scriptures based on the logical division of words and phases.  In other words, the prevailing oral tradition understood in the 5th Century again appears in the 9th and 10th Century, when the Masoretes codified the Hebrew Bible.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, from the perspective of these two sources, the interpretation of this verse indicates that the Psalmist proclaimed divine protection 24/7, which encompasses the time period during the time of the sun (daytime) and time of the moon (nighttime).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Many predators are more active during full moons, wolves are the classic example. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/20/lion-attacks-on-humans-moon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lions</a> on the other hand wait until just after a full moon to become more active, as the moon rises later in the evening and thus affords the lion some time after sunset with total darkness. In some areas, though, <a href=\"https://www.insidescience.org/content/nocturnal-animals-take-chances-moonlit-dinners/1485\" rel=\"nofollow\">small mammals</a> actually can see their predators better during a full moon and thus they are more active as well.</p>\n\n<p>For humans, we tend to stay indoors when there is no moon shining yet will happily take a \"moonlight stroll\" when there is a full moon. With a false sense of security due to the moonlight, we are very likely to trip or otherwise hurt ourselves at night during the full moon. Every Golani trainee soldier knows to expect his commander to surprise them with a night hike during a full moon.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the moon's cycle, or more specifically the amount of light that the moon reflects towards Earth, has profound effect on many creatures. The psalm apparently recognizes that harm is possible during this time, and so hopes for it to not occcur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>How about it means that you receive protection from attackers you can see during the day and from things in the darkened that you cannot see.

Why does <em>Rashi</em> explain the first part of the <em>g'mara</em> as saying that moist ones are a problem; and if they are indeed a problem, then why does the end of the <em>g'mara</em> say that they are not?</p>\n<p>Or does the <em>g'mara</em> mean that the <em>amora</em> who said to use grasses was referring to <strong>dry</strong> ones and the <em>tana</em> to moist ones? That'd reconcile the first <em>Rashi</em>, but would raise another question: if the problem is with flammable objects, then shouldn't moist grasses be less, not more, of a problem than dry ones?</p>\n\n\n",

The reason a deaf-mute, minor, and crazy person are not obligated in mitzvos is because of their lack of da'as, knowledge of what they're doing. It's for this reason that if they were to light Menorah, they wouldn't be accomplishing anything (Shabbos 23a), that they can't take Terumah (Mishnah Terumos 1:1), that one who sends a fire in their hand is only morally responsible but can't be held liable in Beis Din (BK 59b), etc. Thus, it would seem that they wouldn't be accomplishing anything by putting on Tefillin and Tzitzis. </p>\n\n<p>This Halacha is said more explicitly in Erchin (2b): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הכל חייבין בציצית לאיתויי מאי לאיתויי קטן היודע להתעטף דתניא קטן היודע להתעטף חייב בציצית הכל חייבין בתפילין לאיתויי מאי לאיתויי קטן היודע לשמור תפלין דתניא קטן היודע לשמור תפלין אביו לוקח לו תפלין</p>\n  \n  <p>\"All are obligated in Tzitzis\" - [\"all\"] comes to include what?

If your crazy person is able to wrap himself in a Tallis, go for it. But if he has the mentality of a 6-month old, he's more likely to choke himself on the strings. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Arakhin.2b.19?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Arachin</em> 2b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הכל</strong> חייבין בציצית לאיתויי מאי לאיתויי קטן היודע להתעטף דתניא קטן היודע להתעטף חייב בציצית <strong>הכל</strong> חייבין בתפילין לאיתויי מאי לאיתויי קטן היודע לשמור תפלין דתניא קטן היודע לשמור תפלין אביו לוקח לו תפלין</p>\n<p>\"All are obligated in Tzitzis\" - [\"all\"] comes to include what?

Normally the bracha is on the ikar but mezonot is important enough that in some cases it might justify a mezonot bracha even if it is only the tafel. See for instance <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/blessings/20-Primary-and-Secondary-Foods.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/04/05/q-a-guide-to-the-halachos-of-brachos-ikar-tafel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for more background.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the case of mozzarela sticks</strong>, if the crumbs are highly meaningful, and you eat the sticks for the crumbs, there might be a discussion of whether mezonot is justified. But if they are only to give an interesting crunch, then it is clearly sheakol. One of the meaningful differentiating element is the thickness of the coating - thin is very clearly sheakol - thick might lead to more question of mezonot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question is asked for schnitzels</strong> (breaded meat, where the crumbs are much more significant and part of the nature of the dish), and unless the bread covering is really thick, or you eat the shnitzel just for the crumbs, then the brakha is sheakol. See for instance <a href=\"http://shaareihoraah.org/wordpress/?p=620\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> or Yalkut Yosef (Brachot, vol 3, pg 426).</p>\n\n<p><strong>So kal vakhomer for cheese sticks, there would be little justification for mezonot.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Closest direct analogy I could find is fish sticks being sheakol.

Note that for schnitzels, a number of poskim agree that the correct theoretical bracha is mezonot, and suggest to pick a piece of breadcrumbs to say mezonot, but in practice most poskim agree the bracha le-maasse is sheakol. See references above.</p>\n\n<p>PPS. No difference between baked or fried in this case - although it does make a difference for bread products, e.g., there is a long discussion by poskim re sufganiot/doughnuts on hanuka, since the dough is hala dough and it is only the oil and custom that justifies the usual mezonot on them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://culinarykosher.com/recipe/527#.VngYl_krIdA\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> site lists shehakol but doesn't list a reason.

Does it reach the level of the physical?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam describes the nature of the soul and its faculties in Shemoneh Peraqim. There's a fair, not good, but fair scan of the English available online, but the Touger edition is particularly good and fairly inexpensive. It's short enough to not make sense to cite to, especially because the explanation spans all eight of the chapters, but I'll briefly summarize here.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the soul is the principle of life and motion in objects. Anything that is not moved by something else, and moves itself, is said to have a soul. The soul is responsible for growth, sensation, movement, and cogitation. A magnet moves, so it has a soul to account for the movement. A plant grows and moves itself however limitedly, so it has a soul to account for it. Souls are hierarchically arranged based on ability. Minerals are lower than plants, which are lower than animals. Humans top the hierarchy on the basis of our ability to internalize universal truths which are not dependent on bodies for their truth. It is on the basis of this education that human souls are immortal.</p>\n\n<p>The logic behind this is based in hylomorphism, that everything has matter and form. The Rambam states that the soul is the form of the body, and the body is the matter. This is not dualism as a being is made of matter and form. There are not two distinct, accidentally related substances like in many Christian philosophies. By analogy, a computer has a physical substance made of matter, but it also has a program which, while represented physically, is something self moving and able to be cognized. The activities of the computer cannot be adequately explained by the matter alone without addressing the logic of the program. In that way, the computer has primitive soul.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.91b?lang=en&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud (Sanhedrin 91b)</a> we find:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Antoninus said to Rebbe At what point is the soul given to a human?

We find similarly in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.93b.3?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chullin 93b</a> where a body part, although not in operation, is considered to have life to the extent that it doesn't rot.</p>\n\n<p>The physical biological systems are obviously built to do their job. If it wouldn't work it would be a futile, complex design. But indeed, the physical design is necessary and responsible for the success of the organism. However, the more complex something is the more delicate it is. We know all to well how delicate the human being is, for example. This is where the outside influence comes in. The soul is a field, or a bias, nudging things to continue and head in the right direction. We find this expressed in the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.10.6?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medrash Bereishis Rabbah (10:6)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rebbi Simon taught: There isn't a blade of grass which doesn't have a Mazal (angel) in the heaven hitting it and commanding it, \"Grow!\" As it says <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Job.38.33?lang=en&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">in Iyov</a>, \"Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Etz_Chaim.50.2.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Etz Chaim of Sifrei Arizal</a> it attributes some form of soul even to inanimate objects. This further points to fact that it is not about making it work.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind all this is that although God created a closed-system universe (for the most part), He still left it open to influence from above. Randomness is a part of the fabric of the universe. I recall hearing in the name of the Vilna Gaon that God kept weather out of the hands of predictable laws of nanture, and left that in His control. The physical world is not cut off completely but it is surely its own domain. This ratio of physical to spiritual is found in other scenarios as well. The human is mostly desire-driven, but governed by thought, controlled by the conscious self.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Basing off <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3432275/jewish/Do-Chabad-Teachings-Say-Anything-About-the-Mind-Body-Problem.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>, the quoted sources, and other Chassidic sources, the truth is that everything you describe in the question can only account for the physical functioning of the body. However, you are not acknowledging the experiential functioning of consciousness as being a separate thing.</p>\n<p>This is not clear at all. It may be accepted, a priori, in academia nowadays that the solution to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mind-body problem</a> is that everything is just body, and consciousness is heuristic patterns upon patterns that we simply have to figure out. However, this has not been proven or demonstrated yet, and according to Torah sources (see the article, or the quote below), as well as well established philosophical sources<sup>1,2</sup>, consciousness is something that cannot be explained through materialism.</p>\n<p>A computer can mimic a human's abilities, such as reasoning, and out-perform the human on them, but the computer can't have a conscious experience of \"what it is like\" to reason. The concept of qualia, which is non-physical information that is not based on any logical principles, is not something we can re-create, or even have any in-roads at the moment to creating (I am not aware of any active fields of research to create a new colour, or program an AI to consciously <em>experience</em> colour for example), and therefore no matter how well we can describe every last mechanism within the human body, we can never explain why it is we <em>feel</em> pain, or any other sensation the way we do. We know that this chemical breaks down into that, which causes this cell releases that neurotransmitter and this leads to x which leads to y, but at some point z leads to a step which we cannot ever hope to bridge using reasoning and logic: what the colour red <em>looks like</em>.</p>\n<p>This is where the soul comes in, this is where Hashem's immanence, being the One Who can do absolutely Anything, including bringing forth conscious experience and qualia from absolute nothing (not even logical principles), is required to explain the matter.</p>\n<p>This is not the entirety of what the soul is or does, but this should be enough to answer the question. I'll leave off with a quote from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Sefer Ma'amarim 5730 p. 143:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאמיתית המציאות של היש הנברא דוקא הוא היש האמיתי. כי דוקא ביש הנברא\nישנה ההרגשה שמציותו ואינו עלול מאיזו סיבה. שהרגש זה שרשו רק בעצמותו\nומהותו יתברך שאינו עלול מאיזו עילה שקדמה לו...</p>\n<p>The essence of the created self is the Divine Self. For only the created self possesses a consciousness that its own existence is self-defined and has no cause or source. This consciousness can derive only from the very essence of Hashem, may He be blessed, Who has no cause or source that proceeded Him...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In context, the \"created self\" is referring to the soul.</p>\n<p>With regards to your point about whether the soul reaches all the way down to the physical, Rabbi Shneur Zalman Schneerson writes in Likutei Amarim—Tanya, Shaar Hayikhud Ve-ha-emunah, Chapter 1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“even in the literally inanimate—like stones, dust and water—there is\na soul and spiritual life… which enlivens and creates the inanimate,\nthat it may emerge as an\nexistence from nothing…”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article I linked at the start goes into this a little, and you can find sources there. \"All reality is Divine thought thinking Itself\". This is a clear distinction between the philosophy of Amalek, and Torah. Amalek claims that if you go down to the core of the physical, you'll find it is dead. Just dead atoms following dead laws.</p>\n<p>Torah, on the other hand states that the core of reality is Hashem's Essence, the Living God Himself. It is alive. What is the life of a rock? Remember, according to Zohar, a soul, essentially, is a <em>mission</em>, a purpose. The rock's soul is it's purpose. Every rega, the Living God personally, purposefully, recreates the rock from absolutely nothing. What does He want for the rock? That it should not be destroyed unless for a positive purpose to aid man. Hashem cares about that purpose infinitely, He's paying infinite attention to that rock, and if the rock is used for a mitzva, or the opposite, His Ratzon (the highest source in creation of created life) is fulfilled (or the opposite, God forbid).</p>\n<p>There is so much more to say, this is not a topic for a short answer, or beginners, and I pray that my words are clear and correct. Just take away this: <em>the core of reality is alive, not inanimate, not dead</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/</a></sup><br />\n<sup>2 - Of interest: The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and the Laws of Physics by Roger Penrose, although he suspects that the answer can be figured out within physical systems.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, it is permitted to do business with them (even) on their festival day, and to lend to them and all other matters.” The Shulchan Aruch does not quote a dissenting opinion, neither do the Rema, Shach, Taz or other poskim.

As will be explained later, 26:5, that that's why the Torah is called a watch (<em>mishmeres</em>): for it's a guard against all bad.</li>\n  <li>Service brings sustenance….</li>\n  <li>Doling kindness keeps peace….</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>Now, one should know further that even though all three of the patriarchs involved themselves in these three pillars of attention, nonetheless each of them excelled in one pillar:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Abraham in Torah, as he was the first to start toiling in its diligence…, and as it said in <em>Avoda Zara</em> 8 that the two thousand years of Torah started when Abraham was 52…. Therefore, even though he was attention-paid in sustenance and peace and honor, all the stories came [to us about him] that he came with the force of the sword to smite all his comers in a wondrous way.</li>\n  <li>Isaac excelled in service…. Therefore, all the stories came that he excelled in the attention paid to him in sustenance….</li>\n  <li>Jacob excelled in doling kindness, beyond human nature, as in the way of guarding Laban's caprines; it will be explained more ad loc. Therefore, he excelled in the attention paid to him in the keeping of peace, supernaturally.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(See there for more.)</p>\n\n<p>Then, in <em>Harchev Davar</em> to 14, he explains why Abraham was protected from a distance, i.e. before he was threatened directly, whereas Jacob was directly threatened and then protected from that threat: It's because of</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>how the merit of Abraham that went before him, which was the power of Torah, was different from the merit that went before Jacob, which was the power of doling kindness and the love of peace, as I explained above. Very exaltedly great is the power of the shield of the Torah to save from a distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See there for more.</p>\n\n<p>I don't understand. If Jacob got divine attention in the area of peace, shouldn't that protect him from a distance, viz before there was present danger, even <em>more</em> than divine attention in the area of battle? Divine attention in the area of battle can protect in a battle — divine attention in the area of peace should protect <em>before</em> the battle arrives. What am I missing here?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "According to halacha, how should a shul's minhag be decided?",
    "content": "# According to halacha, how should a shul's minhag be decided?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I generally attend <em>Nusach Ashkenaz</em> Orthodox shuls. There are a few in my area. Each has some variations on the placement of certain parts of davening, all of which are fine and dependent on the shul's individual custom. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Singing <em>Yedid Nefesh</em> before <em>Kaballat Shabbat</em> or not at all</li>\n<li><em>Anim Zemirot</em> on Shabbat morning. I've seen 3 versions:\n<ul>\n<li>before <em>Psukei Dezimra</em> (near beginning of Shacharit)</li>\n<li>after <em>Chazarat Hashat\"z</em> for Shacharit</li>\n<li>end of davening (end of Musaph)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above are a few of many examples. According to halacha, who should be in charge of deciding the shul's custom. Is it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rav</li>\n<li>A shul's religious committee, which consists of a group of men elected or appointed to be part of this committee.</li>\n<li>A vote of the majority of \"regular\" attendees. The term \"regular\" can be decided by the rav according to his discretion. Usually, it means someone who comes each Shabbat and not occasionally (like only when there's a hot Kiddush.)</li>\n<li><strong>Caveat to \"majority\"</strong> - what if that majority is not \"halachically educated?\" - i.e. they're davening each day and just following the order / rules of the shul's siddur. Maybe, one or two people among them who are more aware suggest, e.g. \"Since we don't wear tefillin on Chol Hamo'ed, let's make that the shul minhag\".</li>\n<li>Some combination of the above.</li>\n<li>Other criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While what I listed above relates to the order of items during prayer, my question applies to anything that can be based on shul custom, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>who is allowed to be <em>shali'ach tzibbur</em> (in addition to halachic requirements)</li>\n<li>what someone called to the Torah must wear (some shuls require a hat, tie, no sneakers, etc.)</li>\n<li>whether the <em>shaliach tzibbur</em> wears a <em>tallit</em> for mincha and/or ma'ariv</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>North American shuls are generally partnerships created by their members, and they hire their Rabbonim. If they specify a clause that all halachik/minhag decisions are up to the Rav, then that would give him the prerogative. Otherwise, it would seem to be up to the members.</p>\n\n<p>However, minhagim frequently have the status of vows which are un-nullifiable. Based on the sources below, there seem to be strict limitations to this flexibility of decision:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Matters of minhag are obligatory even when there is no clear reason why one option is a stringency over the other, eg. switching nusach.</li>\n<li>If the members of the shul had a common place of origin or other reason to have specific minhagim, they would have the halacha of their original place and all newcomers would be obliged to publicly conform (anecdotally it seems obvious that such groups are allowed to start a shul in conformance to their minhagim even in a place that broadly does otherwise).</li>\n<li>In cases of unknowns, there is no reason to be stringent unless the stringency is known to be common practice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some apparent practical outcomes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Changing any aspect of nusach tefila is at best extremely difficult to allow. I would have thought that if the shul didn't sing Anaim Zmirot, that could be considered a stringency as much as saying it and therefore adding a song such as Yedid Nefesh to which there is no known halachik objection would be fine - but not Yigdal for example. R'Moshe explicitly says this is not the case, and adding new things which were not previously said is fine as long as there was no known explicit reason why the community did not say it.</li>\n<li>If there's no known reason why Anaim Zmirot was sung before shacharit, it could be moved to after, since that's the common practice. But not the other way (maybe unless there's a strong basis that that was also widespread).</li>\n<li>If the previous Rav or the community on its own set times for tefila and the new Rav wants to be more stringent, it would seem he can make the change as long as it's not against widespread custom. Eg. starting maariv after Shabbat at R'Moshe's tzeit rather than 35 minutes. But not in the direction of being more lenient.</li>\n<li>If the previous Rav stated the reason for a particular custom or decision, it should not be changed (to leniency), since it becomes a vow.</li>\n<li>General decisions about kashrut etc. can be changed \n\n<ul>\n<li>In a stringent direction if there is good reason and it's not known that the community had a valid original minhag to be lenient</li>\n<li>In a lenient direction if the leniency is generally accepted, the previous Rav did not publicize a reason for being strict, and it's not known that the community had an original custom to be strict.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Based on the laws of vows, if the community explicitly stated it was not accepting any previous stringent minhagim as a vow, they would not be binding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Background: minhagim have the status of unalterable vows; one must keep his own minhagim, but may not practice either stringency or leniency in a place with a different minhag to prevent arguments. One classic source for these laws is OC 468.4: <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A1%D7%97_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"One who goes from place which does [work on Erev Pesach] to a place which doesn't should not do [work] in a [Jewish] settlement because of arguments, but he may do in the wilderness; one who goes from a place which does not do to a place which does may not do - we give him the stringencies of the place he left and of the place to which he went. Even so, he should not be haughty before them that he is idle for a person must not act differently from others lest he cause argument\"</a>. The Mishna Brura (on 468.3, s.k. 10) there notes that <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A1%D7%97#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Even their children after them are obligated in their stringencies till the end of all generations because, 'Do not forsake your mother's Torah'; even nullification of vows does not help in this issue\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Several modifications/expansions/clarifications of this basic principal from R'Moshe:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rav Moshe (OC 4.34) strongly objects to allowing newcomers to publicly practice stringencies or any visible change in local minhagim - apparently he is referring to a newly hired Rav (or similar) because he mentions removing the newcomer from his post. Even changes between equal options (eg. between nusachot) must be treated as having stringencies, even if we don't know what they are.</li>\n<li>In contrast, R'Moshe allows a newly appointed slaughterhouse Rav to change the process of checking animals (YD 1.13) even if the original Rav considered his approach a stringency; R'Moshe explicitly says the community of customers are not bound to the original Rav, and we see his instructions as relevant only to the specific animals he handled, i.e. the current situation is an entirely new case, as long as the original Rav did not publicly state he was requiring the particular method as a stringency or safeguard (this seems to be based on Magen Avraham 468 s.k. 4). </li>\n<li>R'Moshe also limits (ibid.) the concept of \"the place\" (אתריה) of the previous Rav to world-class Poskim (i.e. an obligation to stringency based on geographic proximity).</li>\n<li>R'Moshe considers (YD 2.15)the general halacha for America to be whatever was common in Europe. If a stringency was generally kept, it would be obligatory. But without clear proof this was the case (here, for inflation-testing every animal's lungs) we will not impose it.</li>\n<li>R'Moshe does not allow changing a minhag based on a majority (OC 2.21) as long as there remain original members of the previous minhag [citing Chok Yaakov (OC 468 s.k. 9) - I did not find this explicitly there]; it seems the intention is anyone on whom the previous minhag has effect, as the contrast is when the previous community no longer exists - if the shul is continuously used, every new person is presumably bound to the old minhag. </li>\n<li>In addition, R'Moshe (ibid.) does not consider a \"negative\" minhag to be binding even though it may imply a stringency. So not saying Hallel on Pesach night, or not saying Shir HaMaalos on Yom Kippur after Yishtabach are all things that can be changed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have seen nothing specifically on this question and don't think there are many poskim who will discuss it except for 20th-century Americans, since shul structure in Europe was so different (more likely for a town to have an established and unquestionable Rav, with several shuls operating for various parts of the community) and is so different in Israel (many minyanim without any Rav, but the official \"Rav HaIr\" is almost guaranteed <em>not</em> to be anyone's personal Rav). I did not see anything more specific than what I have mentioned in the first seven volumes of Igrot Moshe (don't have 8, and have been instructed by R'Reuven to ignore it).</p>\n\n<p>I would be happy to hear feedback and see suggestions for further sources. </p>\n\n\n",

Tosefos to Kiddushin 62b writes that the 3 are necessary for acceptance of <em>mitzvos</em>, but not for immersion into the <em>mikvah</em>. Rambam <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=27&perek=13&halocha=7\">Issurei Bi'ah 13:7</a> writes that 2 is not enough, even after the fact, for immersion.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6769\">Y.D. 268:3</a> writes that 3 who are eligible to sit in judgement should ideally be present for all aspects (informing the mitzvos, acceptance thereof, and immersion[and circumcision]), but as long as 3 were present for the acceptance of mitzvos, even if there were only 2 present for the immersion (and circumcision) it would be OK (as per Tosefos). He then brings the dissenting opinion of the Rambam.</p>\n\n<p>There is no need for an \"official\" beis din - just 3 people fit to sit on a beis din.

The minimum size of a <em>beit din</em> is three per <em>halacha</em>.  (Sometimes it's larger, as elaborated in the mishna in Sanhedrin.)  So without a <em>beit din</em> you have only an <em>intention</em> to convert, but not a recognized conversion.

There are <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16167/472\">several opinions</a> that she in fact converted earlier, or converted conditionally earlier and later confirmed.

The same formula goes for if you decide to become Sephardi or Chabad (most other Chassidim tie Ashkenaz as far as I've seen). In regards to the garment, wool is viewed as biblically mandated by all sources, although cotton has no such widespread appeal. I personally wear a wool garment with thick tzitzit tied according to the opinion of the Ba'alei Tosafot (techeilet).</p>\n\n<p>Another point on vocabulary: \"עבודת יד\" (Avodat yad/avodas yad) means that the strings are completely handspun, they can be either thin, medium, or thick.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue, although not one to get into immediately is whether your adoptive community accepts <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org/wiki/tekhelet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">techeilet</a>, as it is both an expensive proposition and a more complex issue when it comes to tying.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>May HaShem bless you as you seek to come under the wings of His <em>shekhinah</em>!</p>\n\n<p>In answer to your question(s):</p>\n\n<p>According to <em>halakhah</em>, if one is not wearing <em>tekheleth</em> in his <em>ssissiyyoth</em> then all that is required is the correct amount of <em>kasher</em> strings and at least three windings (and there is a LOT of leeway in the <em>halakhah</em> for doing more windings, knots, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>[See Rambam, <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Ssissith</em> 1:9]</p>\n\n<p>If you <strong>are</strong> using <em>tekheleth</em> then you need to make a decision as to which method you will abide by - and your decision need nothing to do with \"custom\" since neither Ashkenazim, Sefaradim, Hasidim, nor Yemenite Jews ever possessed <em>tekheleth</em> when their traditions developed. </p>\n\n<p>There are about four methods that seek to be authentic to <em>Hazal</em>, the rest are relatively late and based on doubts regarding actual requirements, ignorance of how they should be tied according to the various <em>beraytoth</em>, combinations of differing (and sometimes opposing) halakhic views, and latter-day derivations and contrivances from the \"kabbalah.\"</p>\n\n<p>The four <em>shitoth</em> that I am referring to are:</p>\n\n<p>[A] <strong>Ra'avadh</strong> (which is really the <em>shitah</em> of Rav Natronai Gaon)</p>\n\n<p>[B] <strong>Rav Natronai Gaon</strong> (in his own words)</p>\n\n<p>[C] <strong>Rav Amram Gaon</strong> (from his <em>siddur</em>)</p>\n\n<p>[D] <strong>Rambam</strong> (which is a variation on the <em>shitah</em> of Rav Amram Gaon)</p>\n\n<p>[See instructions on how to tie these on <em><a href=\"http://tekhelet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.tekhelet.com</a></em>]</p>\n\n<p>However, <em>me-iqqar ha-din</em> (from the strict standpoint of the law) any of the extant methods of tying with <em>tekheleth</em> are <em>kasher</em> and one may make a blessing on them, but one should be aware of the relatively late and contrived nature of most of them.</p>\n\n<p>All of this being said, any style of <em>ssissiyyoth</em> that personally suits you and accords with the <em>halakhah</em> will do. </p>\n\n<p>The only practical note I can offer outside of halakhic considerations is that a great many <em>batei din</em> will refuse to convert - or will make the process much more difficult - for candidates who \"choose for themselves\" so it is best to just simply ask your sponsoring rabbi which one to wear. Doing such to prospective converts is petty and without legal basis - and is almost certainly a crime in the eyes of the <em>halakhah</em> - but the unfortunate fact is that things like this happen all the time. So, just direct these questions toward them and you should be fine. After you convert they no longer can dictate such things (read \"micromanage\") and you will be free to express your Jewish faith in the halakhic manner you so choose. Until such a time, my sincere advice is to play it safe.</p>\n\n<p>As regards the material (e.g. cotton or wool), the <em>ssissith</em> should either be wool or from the same material as the garment itself (cf. MT, <em>Hilkhoth Ssissith</em> 1:1, 3:5-7). The only exception to this rule according to the <em>halakhah</em> is that no <em>tekheleth</em> should be placed on the <em>ssissiyyoth</em> of a linen garment, and this is by force of rabbinic decree (Ibid. 3:7).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, wear a <em>talith qatan</em> that is comfortable for you, regardless of the type or style of the <em>ssissith</em> that you end up attaching to it. Don't buy into the idea that a wool garment is the more religious or \"frum\" choice - it's not. If you want wool, then by all means buy a wool garment for daily use, but if you find it to be uncomfortable (as most do) then wear something made of cotton or mesh. Remember that while the fringes are certainly of spiritual significance, the garment mentioned in the Torah is of a practical one. We are not Mormons sporting magic underwear, we are Jews who attach a decorative fringe to the corners of our garments - as God commands us - which reminds us of our duties as part of the holy nation.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>which ever specific minhag you go by they should be wool as other ones are questionable whether they are considered a garment that require tzitzis. Avodas yad could be any minhag also, it justmeans that the strings were made by hand rather than by machine. </p>\n\n<p>It's important to have a mashpia (mentor) that can help you decide your minhagim. Additionally minhagim are not just a specific way one does something within Judaism but are part of a specific pathway in serving G-d (a derech). It would be advisable  to understand that and how you will be proceeding before completing your gerus. </p>\n\n<p>I strongly recommend speaking to the Rabbi who is guiding you in the process before you get to the step of meeting with the bes din.</p>\n\n<p>wishing you much hatzlacha</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where was Herod's temple built?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Scripture says that the Second Temple was built on the foundation of Solomon's Temple, but was Herod's Temple built in the same place or was it built next to it? (Do we have any records that say so?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Herod did not build a new temple. The second Temple was standing when he came into power, and Herod did a major renovation on the existing second Temple. He upgraded and beautified the structure, while not moving it at all and leaving the Temple intact. Because of the magnificence of the renovation, the post-renovation second Temple is sometimes called \"Herod's Temple\". </p>\n\n<p>Both the first and the second Temple were built in the same location on the Temple Mount. The location is mentioned in the Bible and specified in the Oral Law. The Temple can only be built there, and the Torah mandates only one Temple in Israel (hence the capitalization of Temple.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Herod was known as a tremendous builder or renovator. According to many, this was trying to compensate for his own doubts about the validity of his monarchy. See this link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2009/12/08/The-Slaughter-of-the-Innocents-Historical-Fact-or-Legendary-Fiction.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2009/12/08/The-Slaughter-of-the-Innocents-Historical-Fact-or-Legendary-Fiction.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>He renovated and extended the second Temple. He didn't build it from scratch. There is a concept in halacha that the one who completes an action is considered to be the one who did it. (The idea of the final strike of the hammer) It is only in that sense that Herod could be called the 'Builder of the Temple'. See the following link for details:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148182/jewish/Who-Will-Build-the-Third-Bais-Hamikdash-Man-or-G-d.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148182/jewish/Who-Will-Build-the-Third-Bais-Hamikdash-Man-or-G-d.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Since Jerusalem was the capital of the nation, he also had a palace there. It's location was at the western wall of the city in what is today called the Armenian Quarter. It is possible that if Christian tradition is referring to something 'next to the second Temple', they are referring to Herod's Palace, not the Temple itself. See the following links:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod%27s_Palace_(Jerusalem)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod%27s_Palace_(Jerusalem)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Quarter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Quarter</a></p>\n\n<p>But he also had secondary royal palaces at Herodian, which is southeast of Jerusalem on the way to the Dead Sea and Masada near the Dead Sea (a summer palace on the southern end of the compound) and Caesarea Maritima.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodium</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarea_Maritima</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://israel-tourguide.info/2011/01/03/caesarea-maritima-herods-promontory-palace/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://israel-tourguide.info/2011/01/03/caesarea-maritima-herods-promontory-palace/</a></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Herod the Great was buried at Herodian.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Need to find a source soon, but basically Herod did a massive in-place expansion/renovation of the existing Second Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

But in this Gemara Berachot, there are two opinions regarding KS, <strong>Rabbi Yehuda in name of Shmuel</strong>, according to him KS is <strong>derabanan</strong>, which we talked about above, and the Amora <strong>Rabbi Eleazar</strong> (there are a couple of versions for this name), according to him it's scriptural, <strong>Deorayta</strong>.</p>\n<p>.

This opinion is based on a couple of statements in Masechet Berachot 13b, a testimony that Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi was saying this verse only, Tanayim opinion supported by Amorayim ruled that this verse only needs Cavana, or needs full awareness.</p>\n<p>. The <strong>Rashba in Chiddushin</strong> in first Chapter of Berachot regarding KS of bedtime and daf 21a , in name of Rabbi Shemaya, <strong>Rabenu Yona</strong>, understand that <strong>the first chapter is Deorayta</strong>.

    "content": "# If I have behaved badly, should I hide the fact that I'm Jewish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If, G-d forbid, a Jew should behave badly in public (anything from simply doing something quite embarrassing, to being rude, to making a scene/causing a disturbance, to actually [ch\"v] committing a major sin or breach of ethics) should he then try to conceal the fact that he is Jewish?</p>\n\n<p>Two cases: both if it would involve another sin to do so (such as removing his kippah <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/69838/is-it-a-halacha-for-men-to-cover-their-heads\">[?]</a>) and if not. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No, he/she should not conceal the fact that they are Jewish. When you do this, you say that you worship men more than you worship God. The Jewish people are called to be a nation of priests to the whole world, and we are commanded to wear certain clothing to illustrate this point. It's understandable that there will be certain points at certain times where you will fall short of this ideal, and you will have sinned against God. But the moment that you become more worried about how others will perceive your sin, rather than being worried about the fact that you sinned against God, you have a much bigger problem. Because you are worshiping men, rather than worshiping God. </p>\n\n<p>It has become commonplace to view tzit tzit or kippot as outward expressions of ones being Jewish. Rather than their actual purpose, which is to remind us of God's commandments, anywhere at anytime, especially when we are sinning. A practical example will be that one will be afraid to be seen wearing a kippah at a McDonalds in which he is grabbing a coke (which is permissible), but feels no remorse about actual sins in which no one is looking at him. Rather than this hypocrisy, one should embrace their Judaism at all times, and all moments, using it as a force toward holiness and repentance to God.</p>\n\n<p>A great example of this is brought down in the Talmud in Menachot 43b-44a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once a man, who\n  was very scrupulous about the precept of zizith, heard of a certain harlot in one of the towns by the sea who accepted four hundred gold [denars] for her hire. He sent her four hundred gold [denars] and appointed a day with her. When the day arrived he came and waited at her door, and her maid came and told her, ‘That man who sent you four hundred gold [denars] is here and waiting at the door’; to which she replied ‘Let him come in’. </p>\n  \n  <p>When he came in she prepared for him seven beds, six of silver and one of gold; and\n  between one bed and the other there were\n  steps of silver, but the last were of gold. She\n  then went up to the top bed and lay down\n  upon it naked. He too went up after her in his\n  desire to sit naked with her, when all of a\n  sudden the four fringes [of his garment]\n  struck him across the face; whereupon he\n  slipped off and sat upon the ground. </p>\n  \n  <p>She also slipped off and sat upon the ground and said,\n  ‘By the Roman Capitol, I will not leave you alone until you tell me what blemish you saw in me. ‘By the Temple’, he replied, ‘never\n  have I seen a woman as beautiful as you are;  but there is one precept which the Lord our God has commanded us, it is called zizith,\n  and with regard to it the expression ‘I am the\n  Lord your God’ is twice written, signifying, I\n  am He who will exact punishment in the\n  future, and I am He who will give reward in\n  the future. Now [the zizith] appeared to me\n  as four witnesses [testifying against me]’. </p>\n  \n  <p>She\n  said, ‘I will not leave you until you tell me\n  your name, the name of your town, the name\n  of your teacher, the name of your school in\n  which you study the Torah’. He wrote all this\n  down and handed it to her. Thereupon she\n  arose and divided her estate into three parts;\n  one third for the government, one third to be\n  distributed among the poor, and one third\n  she took with her in her hand; the bed\n  clothes, however, she retained. She then came\n  to the Beth Hamidrash of R. Hiyya, and said\n  to him, ‘Master, give instructions about me\n  that they make me a proselyte’. </p>\n  \n  <p>‘My\n  daughter’, he replied; ‘perhaps you have set\n  your eyes on one of the disciples?’ She\n  thereupon took out the script and handed it\n  to him. ‘Go’, said he ‘and enjoy your\n  acquisition’. Those very bed-clothes which\n  she had spread for him for an illicit purpose\n  she now spread out for him lawfully. This is\n  the reward [of the precept] in this world; and\n  as for its reward in the future world I know\n  not how great it is. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/rst/kodoshim/42b%20-%20Menochos%20-%2027a-58b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.halakhah.com/rst/kodoshim/42b%20-%20Menochos%20-%2027a-58b.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Rather than taking off his tzit tzit when he was on his way to the prostitute, he kept them on. Rather than hiding the fact that he was Jewish when he realized he was sinning, he made it very clear that he was Jewish, and even explained the Judaism to a gentile, and the world was made better for it.</p>\n\n\n",

If there were specific ways of resisting, the sources might have been expected to mention them.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sacrifice_in_Jewish_law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia article on “Self sacrifice in Jewish law</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In general, a Jew must violate biblically mandated, and certainly\nrabbinically mandated, religious laws of Judaism in order to preserve\nhuman life. This principle is known as ya'avor v'al ye'hareg (יעבור\nואל יהרג, \"transgress and do not be killed\") and it applies to\nvirtually all of Jewish ritual law, including the best known laws of\nShabbat and kashrut, and even to the severest prohibitions, such as\nthose relating to circumcision, chametz on Passover, and fasting on\nYom Kippur. Thus, the Torah generally asserts that pikuach nefesh\n(פיקוח נפש, \"the preservation of human life\") is paramount, and in\nmost situations even the preservation of a limb is equated with the\nbasic principle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>However, there are three areas of prohibition that may not be trespassed under any circumstances, even to save a human life.</strong> While\nthese three areas of Jewish law are often informally referred to as\nthe \"three cardinal sins,\" they actually encompass many more than a\nmere three prohibitions. They all involve murder, sexual misconduct\nand idol worship. The governing principle here is called ye'hareg v'al\nya'avor (יהרג ואל יעבור, or \"be killed but do not transgress\").</p>\n<p>Source:  Sanhedrin 74a, the Talmud records: “Rav Yochanan said in the\nname of Rav Shimon ben Yehotzadak: ‘It was decided by a vote in the\nloft of the house of Nitezeh in Lod: For all the sins in the Torah, if\na person is told, 'Transgress and you will not be killed,' they should\ntransgress and not be killed, except for idol worship, sexual\nrelations and bloodshed.’” A Jew must sacrifice his or her life rather\nthan transgress the above-mentioned sins.</p>\n<p>Someone who then runs great risks or accepts great hardship for the\nsake of observing the religious laws of Judaism without actually\nsacrificing his or her life is considered especially righteous. Such\nan act of figurative self-sacrifice is called mesirat nefesh (מסירת\nנפש, \"giving over the soul\").</p>\n<p>TIME OF CRISIS FOR THE JEWISH FAITH</p>\n<p>During a time of crisis for the\nJewish faith—for example, if a government or any other power wants to\nforce Jews not to be religious—every prohibition in Jewish law becomes\nyehareg ve'al ya'avor, and one is to have mesirat nefesh on every\nnegative or positive commandment even when not in public. This is\ncalled \"Sandal straps\", and refers to the traditional Jewish manner of\nputting on footwear (Put on right, put on left, tie left, tie right).\nIn this situation, one must die even for \"Sandal straps\".</p>\n<p>It is also considered a crisis for the Jewish faith when a particular\nrequirement within Jewish law is in danger of being outlawed by a\ngovernment or other power.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904980/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah chapter five parts\n1-3</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I heard that this dated from the times where Jews might be expelled in their first 30 days therefore they were only \"home\" after 30 days. But after digging into the topic, this appears incorrect. A more interesting story emerges instead.</p>\n\n<p>The source is a <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.44a.32?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">braita in Menachot 44a</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who resides in an inn in Eretz Israel is exempt from affixing a\n  mezuzah for a full thirty days.

As a side note, as to the reason that the halacha is different in Eretz Israel: Menachot 44a and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.286.22?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 286:22</a> say this is because of the mitzva yishuv Eretz Israel. Minchat Chinuch 423 [cited in Artscroll's gemara] explains that the mezuza is an incentive not to leave his dwelling since one cannot remove the mezuzot when leaving a dwelling if a Jew will move in (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.11.22?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">KSA 11:22</a>).

    "content": "# Does Bleeding on the 11th Day Join Bleeding on the 12th Day of the Zav Days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5106n.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Isurai Biyah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רָאָת דָּם בָּעֲשִׂירִי מִיְּמֵי זִיבָתָהּ, וּבָאַחַד עָשָׂר, וּבִשְׁנֵים עָשָׂר--אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁרָאָת בִּשְׁלוֹשָׁה יָמִים זֶה אַחַר זֶה--אֵינָהּ זָבָה גְּדוֹלָה, אֵלָא יָצַאת מִזִּיבוּת קְטַנָּה לְנִדָּה:  שֶׁיּוֹם שְׁנֵים עָשָׂר, מִתְּחִלַּת יְמֵי נִדָּה; וְהָרוֹאָה בִּימֵי נִדָּתָהּ--אֵינָהּ זָבָה, כְּמוֹ שֶׁבֵּאַרְנוּ.</p>\n<p>[ If the woman ] Saw blood on the 10th day of the zivah days, and on the 11th day, and on the 12th -- even though she saw three continuous days -- she is not a major zavah, instead she has went out from being a minor zavah to niddah: because the 12th day is the beginning of niddah; and one who sees [ blood ] during niddah days -- she is not a zavah, as we explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since many of Rambam's opinions in the area of niddah are contested, I was wondering what other Rishonim hold on this issue and if there is a general consensus or majority opinion among Rishonim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In this case, the Rambam's halacha is really directly from an explicit Gemara, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=38&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 38a</a>. The Gemara gives several examples of how a woman could go a certain number of consecutive days (150, 100, 25) of bleeding and not be a major zava. All of the calculations involve a 9 day sequence of seeing the last 2 days of the 11 interim days, followed by 7 days of niddah, followed by the first 2 of the next 11 interim days. The Gemara has 3 baraisos in which this happens. One example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא היה ר\"מ אומר יש מקשה ק\"נ יום ואין זיבה עולה בהן כיצד שנים בלא עת ושבעה נדה ושנים של אחר הנדה</p>\n<p>Tanya: Rebbi Meir would say a woman could have <em>koshi</em> for 150 days without Ziva coming into them. How? 2 days of \"b'lo es\" (paraphrase of the verse of zava, the 11 days between niddah cycles), 7 days of niddah, 2 days after niddah ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an Amoraic dispute as to whether or not a woman who sees on days 10 and 11 of the 11 interim days needs <em>shimur</em>, the rationale of the opinion (Reish Lakish, Niddah 72b) that says she does not need <em>shimur</em> being that she cannot become a major zava through these two days, as they do not join with the following day, the first day of niddah, to make 3 days of zivah. Rashi there is clear that both opinions in that dispute agree that day 10 is not fit to combine to a major zava, the dispute is only if it causes a requirement of <em>shimur</em>. [Indeed, the Rambam who rules that days 10 and 11 do not combine to day 12 rules that day 10 still requires <em>shimur</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=10&hilchos=59&perek=5&halocha=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Mishkav Umoshav 5:8</a>).]</p>\n<p>If you want an example of another Rishon who makes this point explicitly, Tosefos Niddah 37b s.v. ורב אדא cites from Rabbeinu Chananel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"ח פי' דלוי אינו מטהר אלא תשעה ימים הראוין ליעשות בהן זבה אבל י' וי\"א דאינם ראויין ליעשות בהן זבה דאפילו ראתה אפי' גם בי\"ב אינה אלא נדה</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Chananel explains that Levi only purifies the 9 days during which she could become a [major] zava, but day 10 and 11, which are not able to become a zava on them, as even if she sees also on day 12 she is only a niddah...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Because the only scenario in which he would have been dead at the time, has him dying just before their arrival, providing a very short span of possible time for their arrival, whereas if he were alive when they arrived, there is a much broader possible window for their arrival.)</p>\n\n<p>However, given that Rambam never actually quotes Rashi by name, our only way of knowing whether he was still alive when Rashi's works reached Egypt is by looking for hints of Rashi in the writings of Rambam, which takes us to the last question:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any comment of Rambam which, in all likelihood, came from a comment of Rashi?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If Rambam indeed gained access to Rashi's works later in his life, how could we detect the influence of Rashi? One indicator would be cases in which Rambam changed his view on something to accord with the view of Rashi.</p>\n\n<p>One example of such a change this regards the Mishnah in Bava Metziah (7:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואלו אוכלין מן התורה העושה במחובר לקרקע בשעת גמר מלאכה ובתלוש מן הקרקע עד שלא נגמרה מלאכתו בדבר שגדולו מן הארץ ואלו שאין אוכלין העושה במחובר לקרקע בשעה שאין גמר מלאכה ובתלוש מן הקרקע מאחר שנגמרה מלאכתו ובדבר שאין גדולו מן הארץ</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, the following [laborers] may eat [of that upon which they are employed] according to scriptural law: he who is engaged upon that which is attached to the soil when its labor is finished, and upon that which is detached from the soil before its labor is completed, providing that it is something that grows from the earth. but the following may not eat: he who is engaged upon that which is attached to the soil. <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Baba_Metzia.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Trans. Soncino)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This translation follows Rashi (bottom of Bava Metziah 87a) who interprets \"עד שלא נגמרה מלאכתו\" as meaning that the process of development of the plant is not complete.</p>\n\n<p>However, in his commentary to the Mishnah, Rambam, interprets it as referring to stages of the labor of laborer; not stages of development of the plant. This interpretation is also evident in his Sefer Hamitzvot (267). Similarly, in the first edition of Hilchot Sechirut (12:2), he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והעושה במחובר אינו אוכל אלא כשיגמור מלאכתו אבל בשעת מלאכה הרי הוא בלא תעשה...אלא כל זמן שהוא עוסק בקצירה לא יניף </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In these three works Rambam clearly disagrees with Rashi. However, in later editions of this halacha, we find Rambam switching to Rashi's understanding that גמר מלאכה refers to the plant; not the person. His later wording reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הפועלין שהן עושין בדבר שגדוליו מן הארץ בין בתלוש בין במחובר, ועדיין לא נגמרה מלאכתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This term מלאכה now refers to the process of the plant's growth.</p>\n\n<p>In later manuscripts, Rambam completely removes the role of the laborer, fully accepting Rashi's explanation that the only distinction revolves around the plant. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהעושה בתלוש אוכל בדבר שלא לאכול נגמרה מלאכתו למעשר ולחלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In conclusion, there is still no evidence that Rambam was exposed to Rashi's works. However, the degree to which his younger contemporaries were familiar with Rashi's works, is at least sufficient to question the formerly forgone conclusion that Rambam did not see Rashi. At least one interesting change of opinion by Rambam to Rashi's view is certainly suggestive. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[5] He writes in Shu\"t Birkat Avraham (29): \nושמעתי שהרב רבנו שלמה הצרפתי ז\"ל כך פירש חבטן קצצן אבל לא ראיתי דבריו בזה הענין. Clearly he was familiar with some of his teachings. His comment that he has not seen the Rashi implies that it might have been assumed that he had seen Rashi. His clarification that he has not seen Rashi's words <em>regarding this matter</em> suggest that he has seen other works of Rashi. He also quotes Rashi's Torah commentary, and in <em>HaMaspik</em> (ed. Dana p. 137-8) he quotes the <em>Sefer HaPardes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>[6] He quotes Rashi by name several times such as in his commentary to Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>[7] See for example his commentary to the Rif to Kiddushin, 2b where he quotes Rashi by name.</p>\n\n<p>[8] He references Rashi's commentaries to Pesachim, Bava Kamm,Avodah Zara, and Chullin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Pesachim 4:10 states that Hezekiah hid the Book of Remedies. Rambam in his commentary quotes an explanation of this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ששמעתי וגם פירשו לי ששלמה חבר ספר רפואות שאם חלה אדם באיזו מחלה שהיא\n  פנה אליו ועשה כמו שהוא אומר ומתרפא וראה חזקיה שלא היו בני אדם בוטחים\n  בה' במחלותיהם אלא על ספר הרפואות עמד וגנזו</p>\n  \n  <p>I heard, and they also explained to me, that Solomon wrote the Book of\n  Remedies so that if someone would take ill with whatever ailment, he\n  would turn to it and do as it says and be healed. And Hezekiah saw\n  that people were not trusting in Hashem with their ailments, but [were\n  trusting] the Book of Remedies [so] he got up and hid it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explanation is basically the explanation of Rashi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=56&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 56a</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=10b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachos 10b</a>), perhaps indicating that Rambam was aware of at least one comment of Rashi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There are some who record that Rashi, in a self imposed exile, passed through Egypt and met the Rambam. \nThe Rambam hosted him and gave him huge honour upon discovering Rashi's wisdom etc.</p>\n\n<p>Seder Hadoros: <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=221&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=221&hilite=</a></p>\n\n<p>Also:\n<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_6618_120.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_6618_120.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n",

Is it common practice to keep a journal? </p>\n\n<p>Coming from a secular background can taint perspective. So what is the protocol/expectation in sharing with others and 'backing-up' these ideas? Respectfully is it better to share or just be silent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>My teachers who worked extensively with Baalei Teshuva warned me that Sefer HaMiddot by Reb Nachman is a work that is difficult to understand properly and many ideas in fact seem to run contrary to Halacha. A person should learn these works with a competent teacher who can guide them to understand Reb Nachman's words correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The Halacha clearly encourages writing down and sharing Torah thoughts. In fact, one is even permitted to record novel Torah thoughts on Chol HaMoed, when writing is ordinarily prohibited, for there is no greater loss than the loss of Torah. See Shulchan Aruch 545:9 and the commentators there. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mishna Berura:\" ואין לך דבר האבוד יותר מזה שבכל עת...מוטל על האדם...לחדש בה כפי יכלתו\"</li>\n<li>Shut Min Hashamayim: \"וכל הכותב אותם מקבל שכר עליהם\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While honest striving in Torah learning is always encouraged, one should be careful not to misuse Torah as a tool to defend one's preconceived notions, see Avot 3:11 below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who interprets the Torah contrary to the halacha---although he may possess Torah knowledge and good deeds, he has no share in the World to Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Attached is a very nice article from <a href=\"https://derher.org/wp-content/uploads/74-Cheshvan-5779-07.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Derher Magazine</a> which discusses the history of The Lubavitcher Rebbe's encouragement for the writing and publishing of chidushei torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I recall that the Aruch Hashulchan comments on the prohibition of learning Torah on Tishah B'av, with permission to learn certain parts, but even those without depth: He says, It is impossible to learn without coming to new ideas! Of course. Novel ideas are a precious part of trying to understand the Torah. Listen to what the Torah says to you.<br />\nA baal teshuvah has to understand that he needs to be patient. Most ideas that <em>anyone</em> has are going to be wrong or incomplete. As you continue studying the subject, you will find out how your ideas need to be modified, or completely redone. You will see if someone said them before (ברוך שכוונת), or said the opposite.<br />\nWe also need to be humble. Since we have not learned the whole Torah yet, we aren't equipped to give answers that take the whole Torah into account. Even those who have learned everything still need to learn it better. Our questions and our answers are going to be incomplete.<br />\nBe patient. Ask questions, and don't insist on answering them - you can spoil a good question that way. Keep your questions. Some of the best ideas come years later. Some are still waiting to be found.</p>\n\n\n",

We know this because we are told the entire episode of how he spent 14 years shepherding for his father-in-law. Pharaoh then asks Jacob about his life, seems like an interview.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody seems to talk about this juxtaposition. The commentators discuss the subsequent conversation in a way that implies that there's no relevance between the two but we never see a response to Pharaoh's request. </p>\n\n<p>What's going on here? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm afraid you mistranslated a word: \"בם\" means \"among <strong><em>them</em></strong>\" not \"among you\" and is referencing Joseph's brothers who were already presented to Pharaoh in the preceding verses and who were still young enough to act as shepherds. Jacob by then was quite old as is noted by Pharaoh himself when he meets him and as is suggested by the Midrashim on those verses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמִקְצֵ֣ה אֶחָ֔יו לָקַ֖ח חֲמִשָּׁ֣ה אֲנָשִׁ֑ים וַיַּצִּגֵ֖ם לִפְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה׃ וַיֹּ֧אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֛ה אֶל־אֶחָ֖יו מַה־מַּעֲשֵׂיכֶ֑ם וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֗ה רֹעֵ֥ה צֹאן֙ עֲבָדֶ֔יךָ גַּם־אֲנַ֖חְנוּ גַּם־אֲבוֹתֵֽינוּ׃ וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֗ה לָג֣וּר בָּאָרֶץ֮ בָּאנוּ֒ כִּי־אֵ֣ין מִרְעֶ֗ה לַצֹּאן֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לַעֲבָדֶ֔יךָ כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד הָרָעָ֖ב בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וְעַתָּ֛ה יֵֽשְׁבוּ־נָ֥א עֲבָדֶ֖יךָ בְּאֶ֥רֶץ גֹּֽשֶׁן׃ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֔ה אֶל־יוֹסֵ֖ף לֵאמֹ֑ר אָבִ֥יךָ וְאַחֶ֖יךָ בָּ֥אוּ אֵלֶֽיךָ׃ אֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ לְפָנֶ֣יךָ הִ֔וא בְּמֵיטַ֣ב הָאָ֔רֶץ הוֹשֵׁ֥ב אֶת־אָבִ֖יךָ וְאֶת־אַחֶ֑יךָ יֵשְׁבוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ גֹּ֔שֶׁן וְאִם־יָדַ֗עְתָּ וְיֶשׁ־בָּם֙ אַנְשֵׁי־חַ֔יִל וְשַׂמְתָּ֛ם שָׂרֵ֥י מִקְנֶ֖ה עַל־אֲשֶׁר־לִֽי׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren: ‘What is your occupation?’ And they said unto Pharaoh: ‘Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.’ And they said unto Pharaoh: ‘To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants’flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.’ And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: ‘Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee; the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell. And if thou knowest any able men <strong><em>among them</em></strong>, then make them rulers over my cattle.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer to your question in the title is No. Rav Hirsch translates 47:7</p>\n\n<p>וַיָּבֵא יוֹסֵף אֶת יַעֲקֹב אָבִיו וַיַּעֲמִדֵהוּ לִפְנֵי פַרְעֹה וַיְבָרֶךְ יַעֲקֹב אֶת פַּרְעֹה</p>\n\n<p>This means that Ya'akov stood as an almost equal to Par'o and was someone who would be honored and able to bless Par'o. Thus he would not be presented to Par'o as someone who would be offered a subordinate position. Since Yoseph was the chief minister, Par'o would not offer Ya'akov a position subordinate to those who served Yoseph.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates the previous verse as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... if you know that there are capable men among them, then set them\n  as superior officers over the herds which I have</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no further reference because Yoseph wanted to avoid this situation as the meforshim explain the \"weakest\" brothers being presented.</p>\n\n\n",

So when I bow to Beth Rimon, would God please forgive your servant for that matter?\" [The prophet] replied: \"go in peace!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a Jew, however, that would still be prohibited. Rambam, Laws of Idol Worship 3:10-11:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>העובד עבודה זרה כדרכה, ואפילו עשה דרך ביזיון--חייב.  כיצד:  הפוער עצמו לפעור כדי לבזותו, או זרק אבן למרקוליס כדי לבזותו--הואיל ועבודתו בכך--חייב, ומביא קרבן על שגגתו.</p>\n<p>ג,יא  [ו] העובד עבודה זרה מאהבה, כגון שחשק בצורה זו מפני מלאכתה שהייתה נאה ביותר, או שעבדה מיראתו לה, שמא תריע לו כמו שהן מדמין עובדיה שהיא מטיבה ומריעה--אם קיבלה עליו באלוה, חייב סקילה; ואם עבדה כדרך עבודתה או באחת מארבע עבודות מאהבה או מיראה, פטור.</p>\n<p>One who worships an idol in the way it is normally worshipped, <em>even if intended to disgrace the idol</em>, is guilty of idol worship. For instance, one who defecates before Pe'or, thinking that would be a disgrace, or throws a rock at a statue of Mercury, intending to degrade it: because in fact that is how those idols are worshipped by their followers, one is guilty of idol worship. One should bring a mistaken-sin offering in this case. [As he did something prohibited thinking it was permitted.]</p>\n<p>One who \"worships\" an idol as an act of love, for instance he loves this statue because it's an incredibly beautiful piece of art ... if he deified it, he deserves the death penalty. [Otherwise], if he did an act of worship to it in the way this idol is normally worshipped, or in one of the four standard acts of worship [bowing, slaughtering, burning incense, pouring wine], he is exempted from the death penalty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if I'm prohibited from bowing down to an idol while thinking \"I'm trying to show the world this idol is stupid\", it follows pretty clearly I can't bow down to the idol while thinking, \"I know this idol is stupid but I have to put on a show for the people watching.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The letter opens with an account of previous correspondence in which Akhvamazda, the satrap of Bactria, instructed Bagavant, the governor of Khulmi, to build a wall and ditch around the town of Nikhshapaya. Bagavant, having arranged for the troops to do the work, reports back saying that the town was blighted by locusts and the locals were worried that the wall will cause the locusts to increase and ruin the crop which was ripe for reaping. Following this, Akhvamazda issues new instructions for the troops to smash (?) the locusts, reap the crop and, build the wall and ditch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/271r8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/271r8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Aramaic letter from Arsham, Persian Satrap of Egypt, to his agent Nehtihur to look after his interests (423-403 BC)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/INvM2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/INvM2.png\" alt=\"Carpentras inscription (4th cent.

The Talmud (there) offers three opinions as to whether the Jews originally used Ksav Ashuri or only switched to it later on. There are other traditional sources which attest to the notion that the Tablets of the Ten Commandments were written in Ksav Ashuri, even if the Jews used Ksav Ivri before Ezra.</p>\n\n<p>The argument made by the previous answer that Imperial Aramaic is an early version of Ksav Ashuri is rather weak because by that reasoning, Ksav Ivri or Phoenician, can also be considered an early stage of Ksav Ashuri because all these scripts have similarities. Therefore, I would agree that they are distinct scripts and therefore there is no evidence whatsoever of anyone other than the Jews using Ksav Ashuri.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud does not say that the Jews adopted Ksav Ashuri from the Babylonians, it only says that Ezra instituted using that script when the Jews returned to the Holy Land from Babylon.</p>\n\n<p>Source: I wrote a long, detailed appendix on this topic in my book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1FwDM0q\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew</a> see there for more sources.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did Israel's slavery in Mitzrayim begin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Yosef is about to die he tells his brothers that God will surely remember them and bring them up out of Mitzrayim (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0150.htm#24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 50:24</a>-25).  This suggests that they were already not free to leave (they would have to be brought out).  I've read somewhere that if you do the math, Israel's slavery had to have begun in Yosef's lifetime, though I haven't checked that math myself.  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/33865/472\">This answer</a> on another question says it began immediately after Yaakov's death, citing a source I don't know (באר יוסף).</p>\n\n<p>What happened?

Did Paro decide that, just as all the other people were now slaves in exchange for having gotten food during the famine, this should retroactively apply to Israel too, or what?  And if there are other opinions about the timing, what are they?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://seder-olam.info/seder_olam_rabbah_part_3_albert_benhamou.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam</a> according to this translation states that Yoseph died at 110 in the year 2309. The translator also states that Levi (the last of the brothers to die) lived from 2194 - 2331 (year 95 in Mitzrayim). He dates the bondage from then. Note that given the 116 years mentioned in the quote below, the bondage would start from 2332. This may be a rounding error or that the bondage started the year after Levi's death.</p>\n\n<p>However, based on the fact that Yoseph had to return from the burial of his father (and the children were kept as hostages) they were not allowed to leave Mitzrayim from that time or earlier. They may not have been allowed to leave from the time Yaakov came in 2238, since the famine ended then and Par'o would not have wanted to allow the bracha to depart (and Yoseph was still in power until he died). This means while the bondage lasted 116 years, they were restricted from leaving from the time that Yoseph died.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the table derived from this seems to be mistaken as to the birth of Moshe and the date of the Exodus as the translator counts 216 years in Mitzrayim rather than 210 and dates the Exodus as 2454 rather than 2448 and the birth of Moses as 2374 rather than 2368. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And during all the years that Levi was alive, Israel was not enslaved\n  in Egypt, as it is said: (Exodus 1:6) And Joseph died and all his\n  brothers etc. and (Exodus 1:8) A new king rose etc. and, from the\n  moment Levi died, the Egyptians started to enslave them. From this\n  they said [when] one of the brothers dies, all the brothers will take\n  care [of his tribe], one of the group dies, all  the group will take\n  care. (Exodus 1:7-8) And the children of Israel were fruitful and\n  increased etc. And a new king rose etc. It is found that from  the\n  moment Levi died until Israel came out of Egypt was  116 years. And\n  the bondage was no more, and no less than 86 years as being the years\n  of Miriam [in Egypt]. And why was she called Miriam? Because of the\n  bitterness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the time that the sh'vatim died, they had increased enough that it would have caused a major hit to the economy had they left. Also, there were too many to actually all leave as one unit and be able to survive the trek as well as to settle back in Canaan without being seen as an invasion (like the 10,000 of Ephraim that tried to leave and wound up as the valley of the dried bones). Note that Par'0 kept the wives and children as hostages when they went to bury Ya'akov.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says (Shmos 1:8) that a new dynasty overthrew the government after the death of Yosef (and his brothers) and wanted to use propaganda to make sure that the Egyptians would not rebel. They were afraid that the Jews (who were an independent people) would trigger a revolt using the gratitude that the native Egyptians (who still remembered how Yosef had saved them) still had for the Jews.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Egyptians were already subjugated, and it was to his own people\n  that the King spoke: \"We need not fear the Egyptians, they are already\n  under our power, but in this outlying province, a race is growing that\n  may become too strong for us, whom we may not be able to conquer so\n  easily\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Egypt was divided into castes, consisted of different unrelated עמים\n  so the King could well say: See, these Jews who still hang together as\n  one nefesh, they will become too powerful for us, there is no single\n  caste which is as numerous, which has such an amount of potential\n  power as they have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch goes into more detail how Par'o wanted to create a group that everyone else could look down on and forget that he was keeping them enslaved and oppressed.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there a difference in how the action is viewed?</p>\n\n<p>If they are the same, please stop here...</p>\n\n<p>If the second is worse (because it epitomizes a bigger rejection of Judaism), then would there be value in committing an aveirah under case A to avoid someone else's committing the same act as case B?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 158 (with the commentary of the Shach) provides a very different consequence between the two intentions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5095\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 158:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְרוֹעֵי בְּהֵמָה דַּקָּה מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל בְּאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל בַּזְּמַן שֶׁהָיוּ רֹב הַשָּׂדוֹת שֶׁל יִשְׂרָאֵל וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָהֶן, אֵין מְסַבְּבִין לָהֶם הַמִּיתָה, וְאָסוּר לְהַצִּילָם אִם נָטוּ לָמוּת... במֶּה דְּבָרִים אֲמוּרִים, בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל בַּעַל עֲבֵרוֹת וְהָעוֹמֵד בְּרִשְׁעוֹ וְשׁוֹנֶה בּוֹ תָּמִיד ... אֲבָל יִשְׂרָאֵל בַּעַל עֲבֵרוֹת, שֶׁאֵינוֹ עוֹמֵד בְּרִשְׁעוֹ תָּמִיד, אֶלָּא עוֹשֶׂה עֲבֵרוֹת לַהֲנָאַת עַצְמוֹ, כְּגוֹן אוֹכֵל נְבֵלוֹת לְתֵאָבוֹן, מִצְוָה לְהַצִּילוֹ וְאָסוּר לַעֲמֹד עַל דָּמוֹ.</p>\n<p>...and Jewish shepherds of grazing animals in Israel at a time when most fields in Israel belong to Jews, one does not orchestrate their death but one does not save them from death... when is this true? Regarding a Jew who continues to violate and remains in his wickedness and constantly repeats it... but a Jew who sins, but doesn't constantly remain wicked, just he sins in order to fulfill his desires, such as one who eats un-slaughtered meat for his appetite, it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to save him and forbidden to watch him lose his life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shach there, #3, explains that even the first rule is only by the shepherds, where Chazal made a special decree to deter them from there ways (see there for why). But by a regular thief, one would save them.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5095\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 158:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַמִּינִים, וְהֵם שֶׁעוֹבְדִים לַעֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים, אוֹ הָעוֹשֶׂה עֲבֵרוֹת לְהַכְעִיס, אֲפִלּוּ אָכַל נְבֵלוֹת אוֹ לָבַשׁ שַׁעַטְנֵז לְהַכְעִיס הֲרֵי זֶה מִין; וְהָאֶפִּיקוֹרְסִים, וְהֵם שֶׁכּוֹפְרִים בַּתּוֹרָה וּבִנְבוּאָה מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל, מִצְוָה לְהָרְגָם. אִם יֵשׁ בְּיָדוֹ כֹּחַ לְהָרְגָם בְּסַיִף, בְּפַרְהֶסְיָא, הוֹרְגוֹ. וְאִם לָאו, יָבֹא בַּעֲלִילוֹת עַד שֶׁיְּסַבֵּב הֲרִיגָתוֹ</p>\n<p>Heretics, which are those who serve idols, or do sins [as an act of rejetion] in order to anger [Hashem], even if it is [merely] the eating of un-slaughtered meat or wearing <em>shaatnez</em> to anger, this is a heretic, and apikorsim, which are those who deny the Torah and prophecy among Israel, it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to kill them. If one can do it publically wich a sword, do so. If not, bring it about with some excuse...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam at the end of his 13 principles in the introduction to Sanhedrin really makes this distinction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכאשר יהיו קיימים לאדם כל היסודות הללו ואמונתו בהם אמתית הרי הוא נכנס בכלל ישראל וחובה לאוהבו... ואפילו עשה מה שיכול להיות מן העבירות מחמת תאותו והתגברות יצרו הרע הרי הוא נענש <strong>לפי גודל מריו</strong> ויש לו חלק. וכאשר יפקפק אדם ביסוד מאלו היסודות הרי זה יצא מן הכלל וכפר בעיקר... וחובה לשנאותו ולהשמידו</p>\n<p>When one accepts all of these principles... he is included in the category of \"Yisrael\" and it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to love him... and even if he does a sin out of desire or the overpowering of his evil inclination, he is punished <strong>according to the extent of his rebellion</strong> and he has a portion [in the World to Come]. But when one rejects one of these principles, he leaves the category [of Yisrael] and denies everything... and it is an obligation to hate him and obliterate him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, the Rambam writes that one is punished according to the extent of their rebellion. But more fundamentally, the Rambam defines someone who accepts the system of belief which binds him to Torah and <em>mitzvos</em> (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/38249/4794\">here</a> for more on that) as being included in Yisrael, and one should love them, and one who rejects that system is out of the category and one is obligated to hate them.</p>\n<p>Regarding if one would therefore commit a violation of the first type in order to stop someone else from committing a violation of the second type, there is a very on-point Tosefos in Shabbos 4a s.v. וכי אומרים. The Gemara there says that אין אומרים לאדם חטא כדי שיזכה חברך - we do not tell someone to sin in order that their friend merit (in not sinning). Tosefos, to resolve a conflict with another Gemara, writes that if the sinner is sinning through no fault of yours and unrelated to you, you are not obligated, and are indeed prohibited, from doing a minor sin to save him. Alternatively, Tosefos says that if the sinner is sinning wantonly, you are not obligated, and are indeed prohibited, from doing a different sin to prevent his sin. Both of these lines of reasoning apply to this case, with the conclusion that you would not sin to stop his sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Nazir.23b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nazir 23b</a> states: אמר ר\"נ בר יצחק גדולה עבירה לשמה ממצוה שלא לשמה.</p>\n\n<p>There is clearly a concept of doing an Aveirah for a good reason, as having some merit. The Gemara there brings the story of Yael seducing Sisra as a proof that even though sleeping with him was an Aveira, but she got rewarded for it. It goes as far as to say that such an Aveira is greater than a mindless Mitzva!</p>\n\n<p>Also worthwhile noting is <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%91_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avos 2:1</a>, which says: והוי מחשב הפסד מצוה כנגד שכרה, ושכר עברה כנגד הפסדה.\nNo direct source at this point, but I've heard this Mishnah explained (according to the Mekubalim) as clearly stating that there is indeed potential growth in any Aveira, but it needs to be weighed against the more likely damage.</p>\n\n\n",

Krinfis refers to Rabbi Toledano as the 'Rav HaRoshei of Yaffo (meaning Tel Aviv).</p>\n\n<p>A link to Rabbi Toledano is here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%27akov_Moshe_Toledano\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%27akov_Moshe_Toledano</a></p>\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Toledano's bio, he was elected to that office in 1942 and held that office until 1958.

In her house or courtyard, she may walk about with her head uncovered. Although some have attempted to explain the gemara differently (Bach, Even Ha-Ezer 115), this is the plain understanding of the gemara and the Rishonim.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, a Talmudic source that seems to praise a woman who is meticulous about covering her hair even in the privacy of her own home:</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is told of R. Yishmael ben Kimchit [who was a High Priest] that he went out and talked with a certain [non-Jewish] lord in the street, and spittle from his mouth squirted on his garments [rendering him impure], whereupon Yosef his brother entered and ministered in his stead, so that their mother saw two High Priests on one day. The Sages said to her: What have you done to merit such [glory]? She said: Throughout the days of my life, the beams of my house have not seen the plaits of my hair. They said to her: There were many who did likewise and yet did not succeed. (Yoma 47a)</p>\n\n<p>The closing words of the Sages imply that they questioned the explanation provided by Kimchit. Nevertheless, there are those who inferred from here that it is good for a woman to be meticulous about covering her hair even at home, and even when not in the presence of other men. To this we can add the words of the Zohar, which is very stringent about a woman covering her hair. Just as many learned from the Zohar to be stringent about covering the entire head, they learned from it to be stringent about covering the head even at home and in one's courtyard.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the accepted practice for generations has been to be stringent about this. So ruled the Chatam Sofer: \"The rule that emerges: All hair anywhere on the head or forehead of a married woman, even in her room, is a sexual incitement\" (Responsa Chatam Sofer I:36).</p>\n\n<p>Although it would appear that in the time of the gemara, women were not meticulous about covering their heads in their courtyards, but only on the street, women have been stringent about this for many generations, until our very day. The reason seems to be that since a woman is meticulous about covering her hair outside, removing that cover in her house in the presence of strangers is deemed an overly intimate gesture. Of course, in the absence of strangers, the great majority of Jewish women do not conduct themselves as did Kimchit, and do not cover their heads in the privacy of their own homes.</p>\n\n<p>It should further be noted that the propriety of a wig is subject to major controversy. The mishna in Shabbat 64b speaks explicitly of a woman who goes out into the public domain wearing a wig. The Shiltei Gibborim (no. 375) demonstrates that the gemara refers to a married woman who uses the wig to cover her head, and he writes that an allowance should be granted even to a wig made from the hair of that very woman. The Peri Megadim (Orach Chayyim 75, Eshel Avraham no. 5) and the Iggerot Moshe (Even Ha-Ezer II:12) rule similarly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/shiur-18-head-covering\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></p>\n\n\n",

The first part of my answer will be showing why this question is difficult, and the second part will be to offer an answer on the understanding that there is no real true answer to this question and therefore you should evaluate my answer based on your own studies and understanding.</p>\n\n<p>The question of who can follow what p'sak is complicated now, and has always been complicated. The original way halacha was to be followed was that if someone moved into a Jewish community, he was to follow their accepted customs and norms. However, this started becoming less and less the case. A big example of this is the expulsion of Spanish Jews in 1492. The expulsed Sepharadim traveled in such vast numbers that rather than absorbing into their new host communities, they established their own competing synagogues, and even tried to convince their new communities to follow the Sepharadi rulings. A teshuva by Rabbi Yosef Qaro was published to address this issue, as the Jews of Egypt were upset because these new Sepharadim were trying to establish Yosef Qaro's laws as binding, rather than the Rambam's. And as you will see by Yosef Qaro's teshuvah, even in his time there were lots of different opinions on who should follow what and he did his best to respond to them: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who is he whose heart conspires to approach forcing congregations who practice according to the RaMBáM of blessed memory, to go by any one of the early or latter-day Torah authorities?! ... Is it not a case of a fortiori, that regarding the School of Shammai—that the halakháh does not go according to them—they [the Talmudic Sages] said ‘if [one practices] like the School of Shammai [he may do so, but] according to their leniencies and their stringencies’:\n  The RaMBáM, is the greatest of all the Toráh authorities, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the Arab-controlled lands and the West [North Africa] practice according to his word, and accepted him upon themselves as their Chief Rabbi. </p>\n  \n  <p>Whoever practices according to him [the RaMbáM] with his leniencies and his stringencies, why coerce them to budge from him?  And all the more so if also their fathers and forefathers practiced accordingly: for their children are not to turn right or left from the RaMBaM of blessed memory. \n  And even if communities that practice according to the Rosh or other authorities like him became the majority, they cannot coerce the minority of congregations practicing according to the RaMBaM of blessed memory, to practice like they do.  And there is no issue here concerning the prohibition against having two courts in the same city [‘lo tithgodedu’], since every congregation should practice according to its original custom…”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=636&pgnum=70\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abqáth Rokhél, simán 32. Translation: r. M.S. Bar Ron</a></p>\n\n<p>You will even find such confusion and contradictory ideas in modern times. <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3967284,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4 years ago the previous Chief Sephardic Rabbi's son made the ruling that all Ba'al Teshuvoth in Israel should follow Sepharadi p'sak, even if they are of Ashkenazi descent.</a> But, that ruling hasn't exactly made lots of headway amongst Ashkenazi Rabbis, who will still encourage anyone of Ashkenazi descent to follow Ashkenazi halacha.</p>\n\n<p>So after looking at how difficult of a subject this is, with even the highest authorities in halacha trying to respond to it, the only answer i can give is this: One may not pick and choose p'saks based upon convenience or preference, but rather, one can follow any valid Rabbinic P'sak if he has studied the question thoroughly and has determined the P'sak to be <strong>truthful</strong>. And if someone wants to follow one particular Rabbi, then one has to try and remain consistent in following that Rav in all of their stringencies, and leniencies, and no one has the right to try and persuade them to follow anyone else. No one ever follows exlusively one Rav, even the Yemenites differ from the Rambam in certain areas. But building a strong halakhic framework rooted in a solid foundation is key.</p>\n\n<p>And in some cases, there may be a hybridization of both, as maybe one Rabbi whose decisions you follow did not rule on a certain situation, then you will have to search halachic answers from other Rabbeim until you find one that you find to be the truth. For example, if one wanted to follow the Rambam in all things, they would not have answers for issues regarding electricity, dishwashers, airplanes, modern bathrooms, etc. They would need to fill in the blanks so to speak. Another situation may be that a person has discovered that nearly all the Sephardic poskim allowed the use of electricity on Yom Tov and found this ruling to be truthful, and one might have to look through many teshuvoth of those Rabbis to find other rulings that are applicable, rather than rely on the more recent poskim who have since backtracked on this issue. Indeed similar situations always occurred. Jews would often rely on local Rabbis for decisions, but when a situation was too difficult, or their Rabbis had no answer, or the community simply did not agree with the decisions of their local Rabbis, they would write letters to far off Rabbis for answers. An example of this would be the case of the Buddha's hand, a type of Etrog which looks very different than our own but is the same species as the etrog. The Iraqi community in India did not know whether or not they could be used for Sukkot, so they wrote back to their hakhamim in Iraq to ask for a p'sak, rather than rely on their local Rabbeim. They did not see an issue of \"picking and choosing,\" rather, they saw themselves attempting to find <strong>the truthful p'sak.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Some fruites and vegetables that the cRc does not recommend without reliable <em>kashrut</em> certification include artichoke hearts, fresh blackberries, and fresh raspberries.

The main opinion is that it never gets the bracha of hamotzei; this opinion says that bread by definition must be baked. This is the main opinion in the Shulchan Aruch, and the Rema says that the custom is to follow this opinion.</p>\n<p>The second opinion brought posits that any regular dough (as opposed to a batter) would require hamotzei and birkas hamazon.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch only says that a \"yirei Shomayim\" (a G-d fearing person) should be strict and eat fried dough during a meal, to avoid the doubt. It seems clear that his main ruling is also to be lenient. (I recall a teshuva from a sefardi gadol- perhaps Ohr Letzion?- who brings a proof from hilchos challah that the Shulchan Aruch is not really concerned about this strict opinion, and thus even Sefardim can be lenient. I'll edit this when I can find the source.)</p>\n<p>In addition, the Rama adds two very important conditions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Even the strict opinion requires that the fried (or boiled) dough maintain \"toar lechem\" the appearance of bread. So noodles are always mezonos, since they are not bread.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The strict opinion is talking about regular fried dough consisting of flour and water. If there are other ingredients added, such as oils eggs or sugar, it would at most go back to the previously discussed topic of pas habah bakisnin (O.C. 168: 6-8).\nThere, the ruling would be that the bracha in mezonos unless a person \"establishes his meal upon it\" (see there with the commentaries, who discuss if it's a question of a certain volume or of eating a quantity most people would consume for their normal meal.\n(See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/3248/21984\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15651/21984\">here</a> for more discussion.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary:\n-According to the main Ashkenazi custom, these fried (sweet and oil-filled) cronuts are always mezonos no matter how many you eat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the normative Sefardi halacha the bracha is the same.</li>\n<li>For a \"Yirei Shomayim\"- a G-d fearing person- there might be room to be strict and only eat it after making hamotzei on real bread if:\n<ul>\n<li>Cronuts are determined to still have \"the appearance of bread\"</li>\n<li>One eats a large enough quantity to establish one's meal over the cronut.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There seems to be no situation where one should actually make \"hamotzi\" over the cronut.</p>\n<p>On a final note:\nI heard a talk from Rav Berel Wein shlita and he quoted a shaila which was brought to Rav Moshe Feinstein zatza\"l. As is known, Rav Moshe was lenient about milk under government supervision (see the discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/31833/21984\">here</a>) but a \"baal nefesh\", someone cautious about his  spirituality, would be stringent.\nSo someone came to Rav Moshe and asked him if eating milk chocolate, which contained \"chalav stam\" milk (powder), was appropriate for a \"baal nefesh.\"\nRav Moshe responded, \"If you're eating chocolate, you're probably not a baal nefesh!\"</p>\n<p>I think that might apply here as well- is eating so many cronuts in a DD that there's a question of \"establishing one's meal,\" in line with being a \"yirei shomayim\" who should be concerned with that minority opinion...?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronut\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wikipedia page</a> defines cronuts as fried, so, assuming DD is making them the normal way, they are not subject to Pas Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Bracha, the Shulchan Aruch (OC 168:7) defines Pas HaBa'a BeKisnin in three ways, one of which is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁהִיא עִסָה שֶׁעֵרֵב בָּהּ דְּבַשׁ אוֹ שֶׁמֶן</p>\n  \n  <p>וַהֲלָכָה כְּדִבְרֵי כֻּלָּם שֶׁלְּכָל אֵלּוּ הַדְּבָרִים נוֹתְנִים לָהֶם דִּינִים שֶׁאָמַרְנוּ בְּפַת הַבָּאָה בְּכִסְנִין. </p>\n  \n  <p>And there are those who say that it is dough with which he mixed honey or oil... And the halacha is like the words of everyone, that to all these things, we give the rule of Pas HaBa'a BeKisnin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it would seem that a cronut is Pas HaBa'ah BeKisnin.</p>\n\n<p>As for the rules of Pas HaBa'ah BeKisnin, see <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Pat_Haba_Bikisnin\" rel=\"nofollow\">the article in Halachipedia</a>  for a full summary, but, IIRC, a Sefardi would say HaMotzi/Birkat HaMazon, while an Ashkenazi would be stuck within a complicated Machloket, in which case all I can recommend is CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

However, even this has its limits - R' Eliezer Lachman told me that R' Weinberg was very happy when Daas Tevunos was published with the footnotes of R' Chaim Friedlander, because R' Weinberg had been experiencing that people were learning it with their own understandings and coming out with heretical beliefs, and R' Friedlander's notes clarified these issues. So, when it comes to areas that relate to fundamentals of belief, in which even accidental mistakes can have very serious consequences, one should be careful not to draw their own conclusions without discussing them with someone more experienced in these areas.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Welcome aboard @Gabe12.

But the more one is informed, the more likely that answer will be consistent with the Oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p>For example, our sages in the Talmud tie the law that the Shabbos begins Friday evening to the verses in Genesis 1 that read \"It was evening, it was morning, it was the 6th day.\" (Or 5th, 4th...) We see that a day begins in the evening, at sundown.</p>\n\n<p>Rashbam, writing in the 12th century, comments on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashbam_on_Genesis.1.5.3?lang=en&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">1:5 (\"and it was evening\")</a> that this is exegetical, but not the simple meaning of the verse. \"The text does not come to state that the evening and the morning are part of a single day, for it only needs to explain how there were six days – that the morning broke and the night was finished: behold, one day was completed and another day began.\"</p>\n\n<p>But there is a limit how far the Rashbam took this conclusion. He didn't observe the Shabbos from sunrise to sunrise or anything.</p>\n\n<p>When I write a sermon, I tend to extrapolate from existing opinion rather than propose an idea that contradicts all the pre-existing opinions by well-known sources that I am aware of.</p>\n\n<p>For that matter, I prefer to find two points of contact with existing ideas.

What money or other advantages will I get if I convert to Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are no benefits to converting beyond the fact that you are serving as an example and teacher to the rest of the nations, and that your fate is tied to that of the Jewish people, who if are collectively righteous, are promised the opportunity for maximum spiritual growth. However, an extremely high degree of spiritual growth is available to gentiles who accept a Jewish conception of G-d and the universe without actually committing to Jewish law. As a Muslim, you're 99% of the way there. Allah is metaphysically identical to the Jewish G-d (excepting the Ash'ariyya and Sufis) with the only difference being that the Jewish G-d gave the law and stewardship of the law to the Jews, and that he did not send prophets after Malachi.</p>\n\n<p>The Noahide Law (the minimum expected of Gentiles according to the law and tradition maintained by the Jews since the time of Noah) provides one with the capacity and right to fully serve G-d and earn eternal life just the same as any Jew. A righteous gentile spiritually outranks even a high priest if the gentile is wiser than the priest.</p>\n\n<p>There are no material gains whatsoever, and in fact, there are several downsides. You are expected to be held to a higher standard than gentiles, and many things that are permitted to you as a gentile become forbidden as a Jew. Jews are expected to observe 613 commandments, gentiles only 7, 6 of which are \"negative\" commandments which don't involve actually doing anything; just not doing something which you as a decent human being weren't going to do anyway. If you're interested in learning about your obligations as a gentile, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188354/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilkhoth Melakhim uMilkhamoth Chapters 9 and 10</a>.

    "content": "# Walking between women\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Regarding 'walking between women', I have an especially hard time with this in <em>shul</em> when i come out of the room we <em>daven</em> in into the hallway. It is difficult to go by without waiting for them which is a big טרחה for me. Any suggestions or leniencies regarding this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all, it's not so obvious that this is prohibited in the first place. Pesachim 111a says that a person is not allowed to walk between two woman or have a woman walk between you (a man) and a friend, and the context there implies that this is a dangerous thing to do (probably because of something related to magic or ruach ra'ah, see Eliyah Rabbah 3:10 and Shulchan Aruch Harav Hil. Shemiras Guf Vehanefesh 9). The Gemara in Horayos 13b also writes that doing so would cause someone to forget his Torah learning. Based on this, because there is a prohibition to forget one's learning, R. Nosson Gestenter (Shut Lehoros Noson 1:59:14) and R. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld (Shut Salmas Chaim Siman 83 and 90) both write that there is a Biblical prohibition to walk in between two women. However, R. Sonnenfeld also writes that perhaps one doesn't need to be so careful about this because we can assume that most women are not niddos, and that is where the real danger lies.</p>\n\n<p>To the point, though, the Ben Yehoyada on the Gemara writes that nowadays, when we don't encounter demons and the like (which is the context of the Gemara in Pesachim), there's no need to prohibit walking between two women; the Gemara was only speaking for their times when sheidim were around more. <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/838762/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/ten-minute-halacha-walking-between-two-women/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Aryeh Lebowitz</a> says that in general, we are not usually so concerned for all of the Gemara's medical (and magical) advice, and because the Rambam and Shulchan Aruch don't quote this halacha, one does not need to worry about it. </p>\n\n<p>If you are worried about it, though, it may be whatever problem arises from this can seemingly be solved either by saying a pasuk (or series of pesukim) that begins and ends with אל or לא, as the Gemara in Pesachim states (and Maharsha in Horayos implies that this solves the problem for forgetting Torah as well, though perhaps not). Additionally, the book Halachically Speaking II by R. Moshe Dovid Lebovitz quotes that holding an object in one's hand also works to make this permitted. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspxhttp://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46544&pgnum=371\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netay Gabriel hilchus yichud chaper 57</a> (footnotes there bring sources)</p>\n<p>From Paragraph 1: he brings opinion that indoors no problem.<br />\nFrom Paragraph 3: if they (the woman) are all staying or walking in one place no problem (from the source he brings (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1820&pgnum=103\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shilmas Chaim part 2 chapter 35</a> it is not clear to me what he meens, maybe it is a misprint).<br />\nFrom Paragraph 6: if they (the woman) are not set together, and if waking with someone else no problem.<br />\nFrom Paragraph 7: if needs to stand between 2 woman should hold something or his payios.<br />\nFrom end of Footnote 9: a belt is a separation.<br />\nFrom Paragraph 9: if transgressed what to do to fix</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding a Hebrew expression: בטלה דעתו אצל כל אדם\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Bartenura, in his commentary to Kelim 27:3, notes that the rules concerning the admixture of cloth with sack, sack with leather and leather with matting only apply to those specific combinations and not to admixtures of cloth with leather, leather with matting or sack with matting. In stressing this, he notes that, when it comes to those things, they don't combine, since \"המחברן בטלה דעתו אצל כל אדם\".</p>\n\n<p>I can't figure out what this means, and have never seen it anywhere else. I am guessing that it translates to something like, \"[as for] the one who combines them, his mind (his intention?) is nullified by (?) all\".</p>\n\n<p>I am taking \"mind\" (דעת) as the subject, since בטלה is a feminine verb, but the whole thing looks very strange to me.

In your example, even though a person decided that he wanted a garment with cloth and leather combined, because this is so unusual, it is not considered a garment at all. To take a simpler example: we only bentch on bread, because people normally make meals out of bread. If someone decided to make a meal out of wine, that would be really weird, so we say that he's just unusual and בטלה דעתו אצל כל אדם, so he too doesn't have to bentch on his meal of wine (Brachos 35b)</p>\n\n\n",

It was the Capital city of the province under the same name. It was described by Cicero as the greatest Greek city and the most beautiful of them all. It was renowned for its arts and sciences and was the birthplace of Archimedes, one of the greatest scientists of the ancient world.</p>\n\n<p>As can be found in Jastrow, \"איטליא\" is usually referring to the southern end of the Italian peninsula, what was called \"Magna Graecia\" or 'Greater Greece'. As it mentions in the citation, the variant manuscript edition of Megilla 6b reads (זה כרך גדול שברומי), 'this is a great city of Rome', not 'this is the Roman Capital'. Together, that would be indicating the great Greek city in the southern end of the Italian peninsula.</p>\n\n<p>Syracuse was ultimately conquered by the Romans in the first Punic War but remained independent and predominately Greek in culture even then.</p>\n\n<p>The city of Syracuse was visited by Rabbi Akiva and is reputed to have had an established Jewish community even before the destruction of the second Temple. Some of the earliest Jewish communities on the Italian peninsula were in the area around Calabria, what is called Yanov, as in 'Yanover Esrogim'. This area is immediately proximate to the city of Syracuse.</p>\n\n<p>The following links will provide information:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(214\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Syracuse_(214</a>–212_BC)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Sicily\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Sicily</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rabbonim treated the empires of the world in reference to how they were relative to the Jews. Thus, even though the Greeks never ruled Italy (which was to the west of Greece), the chachamim considered that everything to the west was under the Greek influence. \"Italia of Yavan\" would mean that Italy was (since it was to the west of Greece) still part of \"Yavan\", which would mean Europe rather than just Greece.</p>\n\n<p>The normal reference to \"Rome\" at that time meant the Roman Empire. Thus, the \"Italia of Yavan\" does not refer to the peninsula of Italy but the center or control of the Roman Empire whose haskafa took over and replaced the hashkafa of Yavan. That is, the Roman Empire was about control and ruling rather than the Greek hashkafa which was about forcing a philosophical viewpoint on the world.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, the hashkafa of Yavan ruled the world. Within this world, the \"city\" of \"Italia\" grew up and, having the basic trait of control, took the hashkafa of Yavan and replaced it (while pretending to follow it) with its own hashkafa of political rulership. The Romans did not care about the philosophies of the Greeks nor did they really want to bother about \"religion\". Note that the gemara discusses \"Chachmei Atuna\" as the ones pushing avodas zara and philosophical hefkeirus. This is why we have the reference of \"Italia of Yavan\" to refer to the hashkafic basis (and starting point) of the Roman Empire. We can see this when the Christians took over the Empire as it was all about hierarchical control rather than an honest belief in whatever avodas zara became popular.</p>\n\n<p>See Art Scroll 6b2 note 20 which cites Rashi that the \"island\" of Italia was begun when Menashe Hamelech introduced an idol into the Bais Hamikdash. On a ruchnius level, the \"city\" of Rome controlled everything and symbolized the evil traits that overran the world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems to be referring to a city (apparently Reggio Calabria \"The land around Reggio was first known as Saturnia, or Neptunia, and later Italia, which in Roman times became the name of the whole Italian peninsula.

What I state below in terms of \"plain\" knowledge vs. intercourse is confirmed by Rash\"i and / or other commentaries on each verse:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Genesis 4:1 (excerpt):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָ֣אָדָ֔ם <strong>יָדַ֖ע</strong> אֶת־חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וַתַּ֙הַר֙ וַתֵּ֣לֶד\n  אֶת־קַ֔יִן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The man 'knew' Chava his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Kayin</p>\n\n<p>In this verse, it mentions pregnancy and birth, so I assume that we can easily determine in this case what the word ידע means, here.</p>\n\n<p>2 - Exodus 1:8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּ֥קָם מֶֽלֶךְ־חָדָ֖שׁ עַל־מִצְרָ֑יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־<strong>יָדַ֖ע</strong>\n  אֶת־יוֹסֵֽף׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A new king rose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.</p>\n\n<p>Here, it means, \"brain\" knowledge (i.e. - not an intercourse action.) I'm guessing that since there is no mention of birth, here, we translate this as \"plain\" knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>But see</p>\n\n<p>3 - Genesis 19:5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּקְרְא֤וּ אֶל־לוֹט֙ וַיֹּ֣אמְרוּ ל֔וֹ אַיֵּ֧ה הָאֲנָשִׁ֛ים\n  אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥אוּ אֵלֶ֖יךָ הַלָּ֑יְלָה הוֹצִיאֵ֣ם אֵלֵ֔ינוּ <strong>וְנֵדְעָ֖ה</strong>\n  אֹתָֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They called to Lot, and said to him: ‘Where are the men that came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.’</p>\n\n<p>Rash\"i on this verse (citing Midrash Rabbah) says that נֵדְעָ֖ה here means via intercourse.</p>\n\n<p>While he is citing the Midrash, from viewing just the verse itself, since there is no mention of birth in this verse, how would we know what its meaning is?</p>\n\n<p>For that matter, when we view a form of the word ידע how do we know what it means?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The word \"yada\" is clearly defined in context. \nIn fact, the 3rd instance is treated in 3 different ways by different meforshim (commentators) as follows: </p>\n\n<p>the Ibn Ezra claims that is \"a euphemism for laying down\" with no proof. Is the context. The people of Sodom wanted to have homosexual relations. Similarly, Targum Yonasan translates \"v'nei'd'ah osam\" as \"u'nisha'mesh im'hone\" and we will have relations with them.\n(Interestingly, in the case of the first possuk, re Adam and Chava, the same TY translates \"yada\" as \"he became intellectually aware that Chava had been impregnated by a malach...\"!)</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that the statement means they wanted sexual relations. The Ikar Sifsei Chachamim asks \"from where did Rashi understand this?\"  He explains, \"Rashi concluded this from Lot's response 'Behold, I have 2 daughter, etc.' Since Lot had offered his daughters for sexual relations, clearly they had been talking of the same topic.\"</p>\n\n<p>Likutei Anshei Shem, in the Rav Peninim Mikraot Gedolot 1970 edition quotes \"K\"Ch\" that the context could be otherwise: normally people enter in the daytime. These guests entered the city at night! What's going on here? Let us get to them and interrogate them then we will know if they are spies or not!</p>\n\n\n",

Or if they just include every single statement, then is there a debate about the grouping? </p>\n\n<p>And i've heard that there are more than 10 commandments there too. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb of Ohr Sameach, says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T0rcW_HUro\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> within the first minute of talking, that there are 15/16 commandments. (so I suppose he'd mean 15/16 commandments were given at Sinai that can be derived from the statements on the tablets)</p>\n\n<p>So from that I'd say it seems there are more than 10 statements and more than 10 commandments derived from them.</p>\n\n<p>What(if any), are the different opinions then about What constitute the 10 statements? </p>\n\n<p>And of how many commandments were given or derivable, from what was on the tablets at Sinai?</p>\n\n<p>I have read that the 10 commandments are categories, and i've read that they are 10 of the 613 and there are 603 others. The idea that both of these are simultaneously true doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  If it's just a category, and it's listed in the 613, then you can delete it 'cos it'd be covered by the others that are in the category.  I understand  though <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/MountSinai.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">from here</a> that the saadia gaon considers them 10 categories and 10 mitzvot and that there are 603 others. I don't see how it's possible to be a category and an individual mitzva(without repetition), but also, I see that the idea of 10 commandments + 603, differs from what rabbi dovid gottlieb of ohr sameach says in the first minute of that video.. which is that there are 15/16 commandments there.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, </p>\n\n<p>What are the different opinions regarding what constitute the 10 statements? if it was thought that there were more than 10 and they grouped them up then was there debate on how to group them?

Summarizing the article is difficult, but he answers your question about the different ways on how to number the statements based on: 1) the tradition of the scribes who assigned separate paragraphs for each statement; 2) grammatical concerns, and 3) thematically.  He notes also that it is hard to call them the Ten Commandments when the statement \"I am God...\" is a statement and not a commandment, and if we add up the commandments contained in the list, we can find 14 or 15 actual commands.  Rabbi Etshalom also addresses the issue of why these 10 commandments/statements are singled out from the entire Torah, in which we say that there are 613 total commandments.  He voices one approach that sees the 10 statements as an outline for the Torah, but points out the problems with that -- e.g. no mention of the priests here, yet the Torah talks about them a lot.  Rabbi Etshalom's article also take up the issue that, maybe God intended to speak the entire Torah, but the people couldn't bear to hear His voice and interrupted him before he got out more than a few statements.  Another discussion focuses on the differences between the Ten statements in Exodus and those slightly different ones in Deuteronomy.  He then finishes off with a nice discussion of some of the commandments which are difficult to understand.</p>\n\n\n",

To me, bodies are just temporary \"homes\" for the soul. My body can perish, but my soul will continue with its path. And I've always thought this is what Judaism teaches us. But I recently noted that in the <em>Elokai Neshama</em>, which  we say every morning, the soul and the body are described in a completely opposite way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֱלֹהַי, נְשָׁמָה שֶׁנָּתַֽתָּ בִּי טְהוֹרָה הִיא.\n  אַתָּה בְרָאתָהּ, אַתָּה יְצַרְתָּהּ, אַתָּה נְפַחְתָּהּ בִּי,\n  וְאַתָּה מְשַׁמְּרָהּ בְּקִרְבִּי, וְאַתָּה עָתִיד לִטְּלָהּ מִמֶּֽנִּי,\n  וּלְהַחֲזִירָהּ בִּי לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא. כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהַנְּשָׁמָה\n  בְקִרְבִּי, מוֹדֶה אֲנִי לְפָנֶֽיךָ, יְיָ אֱלֹהַי וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתַי,\n  רִבּוֹן כָּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים, אֲדוֹן כָּל הַנְּשָׁמוֹת.\n  בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, הַמַּחֲזִיר נְשָׁמוֹת לִפְגָרִים מֵתִים.<br>\n  My G-d, the <strong>soul that You have placed into me</strong> is pure.

As long as <strong>the soul is within me</strong>, I give thanks before you, Lord my G-d and G-d of my fathers, Master of all works, Lord of all souls.

The blind man put the lame man on his shoulders. The lame man steered the blind man to the fruit and they were able to collect a harvest. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Emperor Antoninus asked Rabbi how there could be punishment in the\n  life beyond, for, since body and soul after their separation could not\n  have committed sin, they could blame each other for the sins committed\n  upon earth, and Rabbi answered him by the following parable: \"A\n  certain king had a beautiful garden in which was excellent fruit; and\n  over it he appointed two watchmen, one blind and the other lame. The\n  lame man said to the blind one, 'I see exquisite fruit in the garden.\n  Carry me thither that I may get it; and we will eat it together.' The\n  blind man consented and both ate of the fruit. After some days the\n  lord of the garden came and asked the watchmen concerning the fruit.\n  Then the lame man said, 'As I have no legs I could not go to take it';\n  and the blind man said, 'I could not even see it.' What did the lord\n  of the garden do? He made the blind man carry the lame, and thus\n  passed judgment on them both. So God will replace the souls in their\n  bodies, and will punish both together for their sins\" <strong>(Sanh. 91a,\n  b)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The soul and the body are individual parts of the human being. In Olam Hazeh, we are only able to exist as a combination. We are thanking Hashem for putting the soul in the body so that we can continue to exist in this world as the combination that we are.</p>\n\n<p>The Art Scroll siddur explains that we are thanking Hashem for returning our faculties to us so that we can get up and continue to exist in this world. Without the soul in the body we would be unable to function.</p>\n\n<p>There are those who say that when the time comes for the judgement Hashem will merge the body and the soul so that judgement can be made on the two together. In the meantime, this is what is going on during Olam hazeh. Once we go to Olam Haba, circumstances change and we do not really know what will happen and what existence is like.</p>\n\n<p>The Modeh Ani is strictly for Olam Hazeh and how we exist here and now.</p>\n\n<p>During Olam Hazeh, the combination sets up the circumstances in which we will exist in Olam Habo.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I asked R' Tzvi Berkowitz this question. He said that when one sleeps, 4 parts of the soul leave, while the lowest part of the soul remains with the body. The \"me\" in this prayer is that lowest level of soul, but not the body.</p>\n\n<p>I once heard R' Avrohom Schorr speak, and he quoted a Zohar which I did not manage to find afterwards, which said על בשר אדם - מלמד שהנשמה היא האדם ואין הגוף האדם - \"on the flesh of a man\" (Shemos 30:32) this teaches that the soul is the man and the body is not the man. (Major hat tip to Fred for all of the following) While we do not find the Zohar explicitly make this point on this verse, the Chida in Chomas Anach on Yechezkel 19:3 refers to such a reference on this verse -  \"דהנפש נקראת אדם כמ\"ש בזהר הקדוש על פ' על בשר אדם לא ייסך\". The Zohar does make this point in Zohar Bereishis 20b </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובכל אתר כתיב בשר אדם אדם לגו בשר לבושא דאדם גופא דיליה - and in every place it is writtin \"the flesh of man\" - man is inside the flesh, and the garment of man is the body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So from here and from several other places in the Zohar, it seems that you are a soul with a body.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As for E-lokai Netzor and Hashem putting a soul within me, my own intent when saying these words is based on the Vilna Gaon's taxonomy of prayer:</p>\n\n<p>Prayers that express an ideal to be repeated and internalized are what we call \"tefillah\" in Hebrew. Tefillos are consistently written in the plural, as our connection to the community is part of that ideal. Prayers written in the singular are therefore of a different sort, \"tachanunim\", expressions of what already exists in our hearts.</p>\n\n<p>This is how the Gaon explains the line in Qaddish, \"tisqabel tzelosehon uva'usehon -- accept the tefillos and requests (tachanunim) of all of the House of Israel...\" We say this when closing the Amidah -- which is such a paragon of tefillah our Sages called it simply \"Tefillah\", E-lokai Netzor -- tachanunim, (note that it's written about \"I\" and \"mine\", not \"we\" and \"our\"), and Tachanun.</p>\n\n<p>\"Elokai, neshamah -- My G-d, the soul which you placed in me\" is similarly tachanunim. Therefore, it's not a place to look for how we ought to see our self-definition, but how things feel to most of us first thing in the morning. The prayer reflects the fact that most people do in practice identify with our body most consistently, and only at times with their soul.</p>\n\n<p>But to answer the philosophical question...</p>\n\n<p>There is a machlokes, a dispute among the rabbis, as to how to view man. One side, found often among books of Mussar, views a person as a soul who inhabits a body, or perhaps controls it as a rider upon a donkey. As Elifaz describes humanity in the book of <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Job.4.19?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iyov (4:10)</a>, “shochnei batei chomer – dwellers in homes of matter.”  When Rav Yitzchak Isaac Scher (Cheshbon haNefesh, Slaboka Alumni ed., intro.) speaks of man’s physical side being an animal, we mean that literally, not merely like an animal. Since much of our yeitzer hara comes from our living in a mammalian body, R’ Scher recommends the very same strategies one uses for taming and being able to use the eyesight of a bird, the strength of an ox, the load bearing abilities of a donkey or the speed of a horse are applicable to gaining mastery over our bodies. Like any other animal, a person’s animal soul has no ability to plan toward a goal, it simply responds to whatever urge is most triggered in the moment. The animal soul must be saddled by the godly soul and guided. And Rabbi Sherr points out with the example of a trained elephant, “next to whom a person like his trainer seems little more than an ant”, to maximize its utility it must neither be overburdened or neglected, nor underused and let remind wild – and this is how we are to treat our body and our animal souls. Last and most importantly, neither an animal nor the animal within can be educated, but trained through habit and acclimation.</p>\n\n<p>This notion is a key symbol in the Gra’s interpretation system — when one finds a chamor / donkey in a narrative, it is generally a symbol for the person’s chomer / physicality. Avraham at the Akeidah or the mashiach come in riding on a donkey as a way to indicate to us their mastery over their own physicality. In contrast, we speak of Bil’am’s donkey, but the Torah consistently calls it a different kind of animal; he does not harness a chamor, showing self-control over the animal’s urges of the moment, Bil’am rides an ason (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.22.23?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 22:23</a>,25,27,28,29,33). </p>\n\n<p>In this viewpoint, a person is a rider of an animal, or to use a metaphor that may resonate better with our more modern lifestyles – the soul who is wearing a body.</p>\n\n<p>Another stream of thought includes the body in the definition of person. Rather than a person’s more human side that rides his body as a master over an animal, in this model man is seen as a fusion of body and soul. For example when the gemara (<a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_rashi.php?ms=Sanhedrin&df=91b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 91a</a>) explains one purpose of the eventual resurrection of the dead by comparing a sinner to a blind man and a lame man who conspire to steal fruit from an orchard.  They are caught and brought to court, but each of the accused claims innocence. The blind man says he must be innocent, for he was incapable of even finding the fruit, never mind stealing them. The lame man also claims innocence; after all, he had no way to reach it. Neither alone could commit the theft, so each of the accused points to the other as the critical element for the sin, the guilty party. The judge responds by putting one atop the other, recreating the unit that was capable of sin, and judges the pair. So too, the gemara explains, the soul could claim it couldn’t have sinned without the body giving it the opportunity for action, and the body could claim that the planning and execution of the sin are the fault of the soul. In order to judge us for our sins, Hashem will bodily resurrect the sinner to reconstruct the person as they were then.</p>\n\n<p>As the Ramchal writes, “Man is different from any other creature. He is a combination of two completely diverse and dissimilar elements, namely, the body and soul.” (Derech Hashem 3:1:1)</p>\n\n<p>The dispute is not necessarily about which is true, it could well be that both definitions of “person” are equally valid. The dispute is more prescriptive: When is it more productive to think of my physical aspect as an outsider, which would weaken the relative weight I would give the call of physical drives? And when am I better off not thinking of myself as purely soul, because then I’m not fully blaming myself for “stealing the fruit”?</p>\n\n\n",

These chunks gave the reader (and listener) the means by which to not only enjoy the Scripture through melody, but also the means to memorize the Scripture (because the melody aligned to the logical hierarchy of chunks of words and phrases, and therefore facilitated memorization).</p>\n<p>In this regard, the following paragraphs and illustrations provide a <strong>brief but simplified overview</strong> of the cantillations and their significance.</p>\n<p>To begin, the following verse provides an excellent illustration.</p>\n<p>First the English -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1807.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Micah 7:9</a></strong> (Mechon-Mamre)<br />\n<sup>9</sup> I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against Him; until He plead my cause, and execute judgment for me; He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This verse seems typical, but when seen through the “logic” of the cantillation, the meaning of this verse becomes more powerful. For example, this is how this verse appears in the Masoretic Text with its cantillation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vYeoi.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vYeoi.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Below appears the same verse parsed into chunks, based on the hierarchical levels of the cantillation. Please note that the more powerful disjunctive cantillation marks interrupt (and therefore overrule) the less powerful cantillation marks which precede. In essence, each successive phrase is modifying its previous phrase(s) if and when the more powerful disjunctives appear. Since the Athnach is the second most powerful disjunctive, its common appearance is mid-verse, and therefore splits the verse in half; in this regard, there are two parts, which Wickes describes as the dichotomy of Hebrew verse.</p>\n<p>Please click to enlarge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aFQdt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aFQdt.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Please note that the first phrase of words (or first chunk) ends on the Pashta disjunctive accent. The next phrase of words (or chunk) ends on the Zaqef Qaton disjunctive accent, which we note is <em>more powerful</em> than the Pashta. Therefore the phrase contained in the Zaqef Qaton chunk subsumes, and therefore modifies the phrase contained by the Pashta. If we continue this process of logic, the schematic arrangement of the verse would look like the following in English.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>The indignation of the LORD</code> <strong>is modified by</strong> <code>I will bear</code></li>\n<li><code>because I have sinned</code> <strong>is modified by</strong> <code>against him</code></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Athnach now appears here at the end of phrase #2 on the phrase <code>against him</code> (and therefore the first half of the verse has ended). Since the first half of the verse has ended, we can “hear” and therefore understand that phrase #2 modifies phrase #1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second half of the verse continues as follows . . .</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><code>until He plead my cause</code> <strong>is modified by</strong> <code>and execute judgment for me</code></li>\n<li><code>He will bring me forth to the light</code> <strong>is modified by</strong> <code>and I shall behold His righteousness</code></li>\n<li><code>and I shall behold</code> <strong>is modified by</strong> <code>His righteousness</code></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Silluq / Sof Pasuq now appears at the end of phrase #5 on the phrase <code>his righteousness</code> (and therefore the second half of the verse has ended).</p>\n<p>Based on the “logic” of the hierarchy of Hebrew cantillation . . .</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phrase #5 modifies phrase #4</li>\n<li>Phrase #5 and phrase #4 modify phrase #3</li>\n<li>Phrase #5 and phrase #4 and phrase #3 modify phrase #2 and phrase #1</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, the cantillation provides nuance and therefore context in which we can better understand the Hebrew Scriptures. In the example above, the cantillation helps us to detect the nuance of this verse. That is, without cantillation, the emphasis might appear to be condemnation with the hopeful expectation of redemption; but when we look at this verse through the lens of cantillation “logic,” then the emphasis of the verse leans more toward the confidence of complete justification.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a good chapter on the te`amim in Israel Yeivin's \"Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah\".

This discrepancy could be explained by different methods of counting regnal years and does not render <em>Daniel</em> non-historical.</p>\n\n<p>In his <em>Guide to the Bible</em>, Isaac Asimov mentions more discrepancies and points out that these discrepancies tend to be in Daniel's past but the predictions which he makes are accurate. He then brings forth the opinion that Daniel was actually written during the Greek period but was set in the Babylonian & Persian period so one caught with the work could claim that it was not critical of the Greek rulers even though those who were in on it knew what it was. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps the statement in the first passuk of Daniel in which says: \"בא נבוכדנאצר מלך בבל ירושלם ויצר עליה the expression  ויצר עליה should be translated as \"and showed hostility towards it\" (because צור is a byform of צרר \"treat with hostility\"). </p>\n\n<p>If we assume that this means the passuk does not necessarily says that a formal military siege against Jerusalem take place in that year.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Note: The Babylonian Chronicles entries brought in this answer were translated by me from the book \"Historical Texts From Assyria and Babylonia: 9th-6th Centuries BCE\" by Mordechai Cogan, which is a Hebrew translation of various Tanach-related Mesopotamian inscriptions and texts dated to said centuries. A different translation can be found <a href=\"https://www.livius.org/sources/about/mesopotamian-chronicles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (see entries from \"Early Years of Nabopolassar chronicle\" through \"Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar chronicle\").</p>\n<p>It is evident in the Babylonian Chronicles that the authors of the chronicles referred to the Land of Israel as \"The Land of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hittites\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chet</a>\" (translated as \"Hatti-land\" <a href=\"https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-5-jerusalem-chronicle/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). For example, in the entry for Nevuchadnetzar's 7th year, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the month of Kislev, the king of Akkad recruited his army and went to the Land of Chet. He laid siege upon the city of Judah. In the month of Adar, the second day, he conquered the city and captured its king. He appointed a king who was to his liking. He accepted their rich tribute and passed it on to Babylon.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recently heard Dr. Yossi Baruchi explain that the priests who authored the Babylonian Chronicle preferred using many ancient terms. We can see from the above entry that they called the king of Babylon \"the king of Akkad\". And likewise we see that Eretz Yisrael was called Chet, because Bnei Chet used to live there, centuries prior<sup>1</sup> (and it is so referred to in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 1:4</a>)</p>\n<p>Knowing this, we may now go back to Nevuchadnetzar's first year (605 BCE), where we find the entry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the year of his crowning, Nevuchadnetzar <strong>returned</strong> to the Land of Chet, and still during the month of Shevat he paraded around as a ruler. etc\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice the emphasized word, \"<strong>returned</strong>\". The previous entry, which describes Nabopolassar (his father)'s last year and Nevuchadnetzar's battles against the Land of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chamat</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carchemish\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">against Egypt in Carchemish</a> (prior to being crowned), makes no mention of a visit to the Land of Chet, for the next entry to earn the term \"returned\". In fact, the Land of Chet/Hatti-land is not mentioned at all during the reign of Nabopolassar nor during the wars of his son Nevuchadnetzar, until this entry from his first year. It seems we have here evidence of a prior visit to Judah (\"Chet\") that the chroniclers did not see fit to directly include in the Chronicles for some reason. Moreover, this shows us that the chroniclers were not quite as meticulous as Wikipedia would have us believe.</p>\n<p>It seems that the only question that remains is why Nevuchadnetzar is referred to as king in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Daniel.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 1:1</a>, when it seems he was not yet king. One possibility is that he received control of a central Babylonian city or territory from his father, so he was already king of a small area, much like Da'at Mikra's explanation for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Daniel.5.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 5:1</a> (footnote 1, section 3) in which Belshatzar is defined as \"king\", though according to the Babylonian Chronicle, it was his father Nabona'id who was the last king of Babylon before the Persian conquest. Belshatzar was \"king\" in that he received temporary authority over Babylon when his father Nabona'id entered self-imposed exile for a certain period. It is possible that, likewise, Nevuchadnetzar was given an office of regency even before the death of his father.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Of them, the most well-known is probably Efron, who sold the Machpela Cave to Avraham.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A bought or found stolen mitzva item\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It's pretty well known that you can't fulfill a mitzvah with something that has been stolen. However, what if you buy or find something to fulfill a mitzvah that (unbeknownst to you) had been stolen by the person who sold or lost it?</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ari steals a lulav and sells it to Benyamin. On Sukkot, Benyamin takes lulav, but later learns that his lulav was stolen. Has he fulfilled his obligation that day, or must he re-take with another lulav?</p></li>\n<li><p>Ari steals a lulav and loses it. Benyamin finds the lulav, tries to find its rightful owner, but can't. On Sukkot, Benyamin takes lulav with his found lulav, after which Ari confesses to him that he had stolen the lulav in the first place. Has Benyamin fulfilled his obligation to take lulav that day?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two possible problems in such a case:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Lulav might not belong to him, and</li>\n<li>In a case where it's lost, the thief might not have given up on finding it, and</li>\n<li>This might be a case of מצוה הבאה בעבירה</li>\n</ol>\n<p>1 . A stolen item belongs to the original owner, until there is יאוש בעלים (the owners give up on getting their object back), and שינוי רשות (a changing of ownership from the thief [other changes might also work, but this is the applicable one]), as per Shu\"A Cho\"M 396:3 (the יאוש should be <em>before</em> the שינוי; in a case where the latter is first, the Shu\"A says he thinks that it still belongs to the original owner). Therefore, assuming this is a case where the person who was stolen from gave up on finding his lulav, the lulav now belongs to the buyer, because there was 'giving up' and 'a change in ownership'. If the owner didn't give up, then the lulav doesn't belong to the buyer.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>In the second case given, where the lulav was <em>found</em>, this leads us in to the realm of השבת אבידה, which is lengthy. In short, the owner must give up on finding his object. Therefore, if it has signs which the owner can readily identify his object by, we assume he didn't give up and the lulav doesn't belong to the finder. If it has no signs, and the owner will notice its loss, we assume he gave up on finding it. In our case, though, we might not have to worry about this at all, seeing as the thief doesn't actually own the object, and we're under the assumption (from the previous point) that the original owner already has יאוש.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>מצוה הבאה בעבירה - doing a mitzva while simultaneously committing an Aveira, is complicated. Here, the buyer is not stealing. Beyond that, he's <em>annus</em> and didn't know the lulav was stolen. The Aveira he <em>did</em> commit is מחזיק ידי עוברי עבירה (supporting another's sinning), which is a form of Lifnei Iver (Shu\"A Cho\"M 396:1). However, since it could be committed by others, it's not fully Lifnei Iver and it's only d'Rabanan (אשל אברהם סעיף קטן ב, among others).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The S'dei Chemed (chelek Dalet, klal 77) talks about many aspects of mitzva haba'a b'aveira, and brings a machlokes by a case where the Aveira is d'Rabanan, and a machlokes where the Aveira is done <em>b'oneis</em>. In the second machlokes, he holds that there's still mitzva haba'a b'aveira. In the first, he leans towards the side that it's muttar.</p>\n<p>I didn't see anyone (quoted by the S'dei Chemed) who holds that in both cases (annus and d'Rabanan) there's still mitzva haba'a b'aveira, but there are definitely Achronim who are machmir in either of the two cases, so it seems to me that it'd be preferable to shake lulav again. However, if that's unfeasible, seemingly יש על מי לסמוך, and he's yotzei. And in a case where he found the lulav, there's no problem of מחזיק ידי עוברי עבירה at all,and assuming the previously mentioned problems are dealt with, he would be yotzei with this lulav.</p>\n\n\n",

According the the Rema (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=497\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 105:3</a>) the heat must be (a) from a \"כלי ראשון\"--a utensil that itself has been on the fire; AND (b) if the utensil is no longer on the fire, the non-kosher item must have fallen in immediately after the the utensil was taken off the fire so that the scalding heat is still present. The Aruch Hashulchan (ad loc.) notes that most poskim agree with the Rema. The Maharshal (see Shach ad. loc.) is more stringent. He holds that items can become non-kosher through heat the hand would recoil from, even if the utensil was never on the fire.

Therefore <strong>he rules that [...] one may recite a bracha opposite and outside a bathroom even when the door is open</strong> (even if tzo'ah is present in the bathroom as it is considered as in a different domain). <strong>R Tzvi Pesach Frank reaches a similar conclusion</strong> (Har Tzvi OC 1:48).

    "content": "# Driving in a Blizzard after Shabbat Begins\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone is driving and stuck in a blizzard on the highway when Shabbat begins. It would most likely be life threatening to leave the car on the side of the highway and walk in a blinding blizzard. It's also life threatening to remain in the car in the cold with the engine off and leaving it on all Shabbat may cause CO build-up.</p>\n\n<p>Given all these factors, can a person continue driving until he reaches the closest safe area? What if he is unfamiliar with the area he's in, but can manage to get to his home, which, in the snow, may take a few hours, but, at least, there, he knows he will be safe. Can he continue driving on Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is a <em>mitzvah</em> to violate <em>Shabbat</em> to save a person's life (see e.g. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1596\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 328:2</a>). When doing so, the minimum possible <em>Shabbat</em> violation should be done (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1597\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 328:16</a> and the <em>Mishna Berura</em> there).  So if continuing to drive on <em>Shabbat</em> is the only way to save the person's life, then it should be done. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that driving (a gasoline-powered car) is assur <em>mi'deoraita</em> according to pretty much all opinions on <em>Shabbat</em>.  Therefore, pretty much any alternative would be preferable. If there is another less-problematic option, continuing to drive would still be forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>I am also talking here about the case where the person is seriously in a life-threatening situation (like he needs to get home in the next 30 minutes to take his insulin or the temperature is life-threateningly cold even for a short exposure). The person should honestly consider whether this is indeed the case. If being in the shelter of a turned-off car for 30 minutes doesn't pose a serious risk of death, it may be preferable to try to wait it out and see if the blizzard passes and getting home without driving becomes possible (CYLOR).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>He should not risk his life. Instead, he should violate Shabbat in order to stay safe.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing a person should do when they see that Shabbat is approaching and they are likely to get stuck, is get on the phone with a Rabbi, ideally one several time zones over. (Always good to have a Californian Rabbi in your phone).</p>\n\n<p>He should seek to minimize Shabbat desecration as much as possible.\nIf is at all possible to find a Gentile to drive, he should do so.\nHe should try to find a safe place as close as possible, since each continuing driving is a separate issur. Any standard motel would constitute a safe location. So would a Jewish community nearby. Even if the nearest place is his hometown, he should not continue driving home, but rather stop at the first safe house.</p>\n\n<p>He may not be allowed to turn the car off or even close the car door. </p>\n\n<p>While generally one should minimize issurim while driving on Shabbat, in a blizzard, that is not so applicable. (He should obviously signal, etc. as it would constitute a danger.)</p>\n\n\n",

He wrote Shaarei Teshuva to express his remorse. </p>\n\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonah_Gerondi\">Wikipedia</a>, \"Some believe this was only a myth created by the followers of the Rambam.\" What are the sources for and against this and the original claim? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is true that Rabbeinu Yonah saw the mass burning of the Talmud in 1242 as evidence that his support for the burning of the Rambam's works in 1233 was a mistake. He made a public confession in the synagogue in Montpellier (in Languedoc, but still in what Jews tend to call Provence) to that effect. There he announced intent to travel to the Rambam's grave to ask for his forgiveness, prostrating on the grave in front of a minyan for 7 days. His journey made it at least to Barcelona, where he was detained, and ended far short of the original goal in Toledo, where Rabbeinu Yonah wrote his commentary on the gemara.</p>\n\n<p>But \"Shaarei Teshuvah\" is just the sole surviving section of a book called \"Shaarei Tzedeq\". It wasn't written as a project specifically about teshuvah, therefore the idea that it was written as a penance is far less compelling. \nThe tradition that Shaarei Teshuvah was written as atonement for his role in instigating the Rambam's works also places the burning of the Talmud's a mere 40 days later, making the connection much more obvious and harder to reject. But that date is provable from church records to be more myth than history.</p>\n\n<p>There is no indication when Shaarei Teshuvah was written, as the earliest extant edition of is from 1505, 242 years after Rabbeinu Yonah's passing (1263). With only 21 of his 63 or 83 years being after the burning of the Rambam, and we know that he spent much of that time writing and teaching halachah, we don't even know if the book was written after the journey.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a citiaion from \"The Chosen Path\" - a history of Medieval Jewry by Binyamin Sendler:\nR’ Yonah b. Avraham certainly saw it in this light. Following is an extract from the letter that his student R’ Hillel HaChasid (of Verona) wrote to R’ Yitzchok HaRofeh: Letter by R’ Hillel HaChasid    </p>\n\n<p>R’ Yonah of Barcelona (originally of Gerona) was the primary instigator of this controversy that brought about all the calamities that befell the Jews in France. At that time R’ Yonah’s heart melted within him, and he vowed to make a pilgrimage to the Rambam’s grave and remain there for seven days, begging forgiveness from the Rambam for slandering his works. He publicly confessed in these words: “I am embarrassed and I regret that I opened my mouth against our holy master R’ Moshe b. Maimon and his works. I say now for all to hear: Moshe is true and his Torah is true and we are all frauds . . .” All the places where the Rambam’s works were derided were then filled with awe and fear, and all who had contested him accepted the verdict of heaven. R’ Yonah set up his yeshiva in Barcelona and every time he taught he would cite the Rambam’s opinion and say, “Thus says R’ Moshe, and so it appears to me.” He never again argued with the Rambam’s conclusions. Nevertheless, he was punished for delaying the fulfillment of his vow for many years until he had almost forgotten it. He left Barcelona with the intention to take a boat to the Rambam’s grave in Eretz Yisroel, but he was detained in Toledo where the Jews begged him to stay for a year or two, so he opened his yeshiva there (and there he died). \nThere is no authentic source that suggests that R’ Yonah wrote his Sha’arei Teshuva as a penance for the part he played in this controversy. </p>\n\n<p>He adds in  FOOTNOTE:</p>\n\n<p>1 This is as reported by R’ Hillel HaChasid. He relates that “not only were the Rambam’s works burned, but the fire to burn them was taken from the flame burning before their altar in the great cathedral in Paris. . . Should you ask how it is known that the burning of the Talmud was divine retribution for the destruction of the Rambam’s works, I would answer you that there was less than forty days between the two burnings, and the Talmud was burnt in the same place as the Moreh was. The ashes of the Moreh were mixed with the ashes of the Talmud.” These details, however, are suspect; the two events did not occur in the same year, and it seems unlikely that the works confiscated in Provence were carted hundreds of miles to Paris to be burned. It is possible that R’ Hillel’s information was defective.  </p>\n\n\n",

There are very many stars so this is the first expression  of multitude.</p>\n\n<p>The second is “if thou be able to count them” which is an additional expression of multitude. </p>\n\n<p>The second expression cannot have the same meaning as the first expression and thus the Haemek Dovor (as is his way) explains the second expression. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would like to answer with a visual aide.  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q2ZoQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q2ZoQ.jpg\" alt=\"Max Moorman's photo of the Milky Way and the Great Sand Dunes in Colorado\"></a> This is my friend Max Moorman's photo of the Milky Way and other stars taken from the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado.  (c) 2015 Max Moorman Photography.  I imagine that there was even less ambient light in Avram's day than there was when Max took this photo. If we read the entire verse of Gen. 15:5, it says \"And He took him outside, and He said, \"Please look heavenward and count the stars, if you are able to count them.\" And He said to him, \"So will be your seed.\"  Rashi explains that the plain meaning of \"He took him outside\" would be outside the tent.  But Rashi brings down a midrash, Gen. Rabbah 44:12 and says \"outside\" means that God took Avram into outer space and gave him an even more awe-inspiring view like this one taken by the astronauts on the International Space Station: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g3qy6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g3qy6.jpg\" alt=\"View from International Space Station\"></a>.  So by taking Avram \"outside\" God was taking him outside his normal frame of reference to show him that there are even more stars than he can imagine.  So when God says \"if you can count them,\" on one level he is saying that many more stars than one can count, but on earth one can never count them all, and even in the heavens, it is not easy.  Some are hidden by clouds, some by the ambient light on the moon or other stars, or the glare of sunlight reflecting in the atmosphere. We must also remember that some of the most significant stars, black holes, give off no light, yet their power is so strong they suck all matter, including light rays into it.</p>\n\n<p>But as the Haamek Davar concludes, God gave Avram the comparison to stars, and the tour above, to understand that his descendants will be a light to the nations disproportionate to their total mass.</p>\n\n<p>When God tells Avram to look at the stars, He then says \"so (כה) shall be your descendants.\" The word כה is unusual.  It is also used to refer to the Jews greatness at Mt. Sinai, \"So [כה] shall you say to the House of Jacob” (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9880#v=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex. 19:3</a>).  The allusion to stars also is generally an allusion to greatness.  Stars are unique (God gave each a name, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16368#v=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ps. 147:4</a>, indicating that every star has its own mission and function.  Similarly, each Jewish soul is precious, unique, and has a definite purpose in this world.  But, as the Haamek Davar notes, there will be some individuals who will bring light to their nations, but they will be no more than a solar system compared to the galaxies represented by Avram's descendants.  This is not only our potential, it is our goal and destiny and our reason for being here. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it improper to invite a few single girls and a few single boys for a Shabbos meal to help fight the \"shidduch crisis\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The shidduch system, according to many sources, isn't working and we're in a \"shidduch crisis.\"  See, e.g. this <a href=\"http://5tjt.com/the-shidduch-crisis-explained/\">article</a>.  People complain, but nothing gets done.  </p>\n\n<p>I don't see that the shadchan system is working for everyone with resumes and references is really working.  Among non-Hasidic Jews, there is a surplus of women over 24 who are still single, and in the Hasidic community there is a surplus of men over 24 who have not married.  (Source, Mishpacha magazine, Succos edition 2015).  </p>\n\n<p>I have observed that the restrictions on getting single boys and girls in the same room could go to the heart of the problem. Such restrictions weren't always an issue, however. I heard that Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, shlita, a senior rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University's rabbinic college and son-in-law of Rav Moshe Feinstein, zt'l, was married at a wedding where the tables had mixed-sex seating and singles were put at smaller tables so they could meet and talk.  Rav Tendler said about that mixing the singles was approved by his father-in-law but he facetiously added \"some would say my father-in-law didn't know the halacha.\")  Also, I understand from Rabbi Berel Wein, shlita, that mixed seating at weddings was common at the weddings of many European gedolim and their sons and daughters, with the lone exception of Hungary.  He said since the Germans took over Hungary last, more Jews survived and so did their customs.  </p>\n\n<p>Why shouldn't I invite boys from the yeshiva gedolah to meet single girls of the same age at my Shabbos table?  Would it be better if I invited their parents as well?  What sources say that inviting singles to my home to meet at a Shabbos meal, for purposes of helping them to find a shidduch, is improper?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As long as the atmosphere is appropriate (and customs of some communities notwithstanding), there is nothing formally wrong with a mixed table. Rav Moshe in OC 1.39 states clearly that outside of public gatherings, there is no requirement to separate the sexes (his proof: Chana entered the Ezrat Yisrael of the Mishkan for Eli to notice her davening!) in cases which will not lead to lightheaded behaviour (kalut rosh), even though he disapproves of meetings without a mechitza (YD 2.109). However, it is a fine line and relies on the maturity of all participants not to transgress serious prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>The relevant halacha here is Even HaEzer at the beginning of siman 21: <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%9B%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"A person must distance himself from women to a very great extent; it is forbidden to signal with his hands or feet, or to wink at any forbidden relation. It is forbidden to joke with her, to be lightheaded opposite her, or to gaze at her beauty. Even to smell her perfume is forbidden.\"</a></p>\n\n<p>Even HaEzer 21:3 makes it very clear that  that halacha is not advocating boys and girls not go on dates! What is forbidden is friendship or casual social interaction between the sexes. A one-on-one date would seem to be the best combination of serious/appropriate in atmosphere plus effective in meeting the other person.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, will mixed Shabbos tables solve more problems than they lead to, or vice versa? Is every person there a serious prospective (or \"on paper\") match for every member of the opposite sex? Is the Shabbos table environment really the most conducive to two people seriously considering each other as a partner? Or are we just creating a friendly, lighthearted and jocular social scene?</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn't it be more effective to sit down with each of the guests, make a list of their shidduch priorities, and set them up on dates where appropriate?</p>\n\n\n",

Yishmael's 13 talmudic rules?</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Are any of the 13 principles more effective in transferring  de'oraiso character? (Since Gzeira Shava is a tradition from Sinai (see related question) I might have thought it would be more effective.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The rules of <em>derashah</em> are used in two ways:</p>\n\n<p>The \"real\" way, <em>derashah</em>, does produce <em>deOraisos</em> -- actual Torah law.</p>\n\n<p>Even if one follows the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=81&perek=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam, Mamrim 2:1</a>, that <em>derashos</em> could be invented/discovered -- let's just say \"utilized\" -- for the first time centuries after Sinai. And that another court may choose not to use it. One example, not given by the Rambam, is that according to Ruth Rabba, the derashah that only a male Moabite convert is restricted from marrying into the Jewish people, but a woman may, was first used by Boaz. Which then makes the closer relative's reluctance to marry her very understandable. Maybe Boaz erred?</p>\n\n<p>This is <strong>not</strong> the usual understanding. Typically we follow the majority of <em>rishonim</em>, that while all of the <em>deOraisos</em> were given in Sinai, some were recorded in the text, some were hinted in the text via <em>derashah</em>, and some are <em>halakhos leMoshe miSinai</em> [laws given to Moses from Sinai]. (Understood to mean that either are not in the text at all or we forgot how they connect to their source verse, but every <em>deOraisa</em> does connect somehow. The latter opinion being that of the Malbim, intro. to Vayiqra.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus either every <em>derashah</em> was given at Sinai alongside the laws, or they are rhetorical devices utilized later to support laws that were given at Sinai and thus already known. For example, to help decide in a dispute among valid interpretations of what was given in Sinai, which one should become law.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are also <em>asmachtos</em>, connections, where the rabbis find a connection between a rabbinic law and the text of the chumash. According to the typical explanation (eg <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hakdama/3-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Rambam's introduction to Mishnah</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kitab_al_Khazari/Part_Three\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Kuzari 3:73</a>), this is done for mnemonic reasons, or to impress on the masses the import of the law.</p>\n\n<p>According to the other opinion (Raavad <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=81&perek=2&halocha=9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mamrim 2:9</a>, Ritva <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9610&st=%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%9C%D7%95%20%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%90&pgnum=352\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosh haShanah 16a</a>), these are laws Hashem only suggested to the court, something they may wish to enact some day, as needed. But since they are suggestions, and not actually legislated until the court decided to, the resulting laws are rabbinic.</p>\n\n<p>Tangentially, there are other lists of rules. Hillel made a science of derashah, which until then were used without an overall theory and system, and noted the body of existing <em>derashah</em> fits 7 rules. R’ Yishma’el and R’ Aqiva each broke down those rules into subcategories. Because of differences in approach, R’ Yishma’el’s exposition yielded 13 laws, R’ Aqiva’s, 19. Rabbi Eliezer ben R Yosi haGelili later suggest 32. But these are taxonomies, not differences in actual content. You will find Rabbi Aqiva using one of Rabbi Yishmael's rules (eg <em>kelal uperat</em>) or Rabbi Yishmael using one of Rabbi Aqiva's (such as <em>ribui umi'ut</em>). The latter is far less common, <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/midrashei-halakhah\" rel=\"nofollow\">but that's a topic in itself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I mention this debate as an opportunity to point out that it is <strong>not</strong> evidence that <em>derashos</em> necessarily post-date Sinai, as the rules discussed describe sets of existing \"data\" after the fact.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904154/jewish/The-Principles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Sefer Hamitzvos, Principle 2</a> is that in order to count the  613 biblical obligations and prohibitions we:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not include laws which are derived from one of the Thirteen\n  Principles of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exegesis (at the linked site):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every word and letter in the Torah is exact, and the Sages\n  extrapolated many laws from an extra (or missing) word or letter, or a\n  particular sequence which the Torah chooses to use. Nevertheless, unless the Sages explicitly say\n  that a particular law that they derived is categorized as biblical, it\n  is not counted as part of the 613.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the answer to the question seems to be that the inferred law has the status of a de'oraiso only if the Sages explicitly say so. </p>\n\n<p>(It sounds like a paradox.)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @mevaqesh.</p>\n\n\n",

This is in line with the sentiment in Kiddushin 29b that a person should first learn Torah and then get married. The time it takes to learn takes either 3 or 5 years (Chullin 24a), and there are two opinions on when one should get married - either 18 or 20 (Kiddushin 29b). Both agree that one should start learning at age 15, and both agree that one should accomplish their learning before getting married, and the disagreement is how long that takes, either 3 or 5 years, which yields the two ages of 18 and 20.</p>\n\n<p>(This was partially reconstructed based on what I remember and a source provided by @Fred)</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, had the mishnah not said it explicitly, then the Kohanim would make the mistake of thinking that the left side (being larger) was the one that was supposed to be picked up in the right hand and could drop the side with the liver.</p>\n\n<p>Note also the picture of the lamb on the bottom of page 31a3 which shows the lines of the various portions. The picture shows that the right flank is greater in volume as it includes the top part of the left side but the spine itself is part of the left flank (though not the meat on top of it). This causes the left flank to <strong>appear</strong> greater even though the spine itself is light.</p>\n\n<p>This note says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Raavad</em> questions what practical difference it would make whether the right or left flank is called the \"greater one\". <em>Raavad</em> suggests\n  that \"the greater one\" means the heavier one: An unsuspecting Kohen\n  may not realize that the right flank is heavier and may attempt to\n  take it in his [weaker] left hand. This could lead him to drop the\n  sacrificial limb. <em>Raavad</em> adds [within this answer] that the right\n  flank should be held in the right hand for another reason too: because\n  it is the more distinguished limb. Thus, the Sages called the right\n  flank the greater one to alert Kohanim that it should be held in the\n  right hand (cf. second explanation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Kahati seems to say \"because of the kaved\" which implies because of the liver however, this would not be clear whether he means the first or second explanation that you give. Ikar Tosfos Yom Tov and Tiferes Yisrael on the Mishnah seem to say that it is because the liver is separate organ and not part of the \"space\" of the dofen (flank) but attached to it, then it is called \"big\". (Your first explanation) The answer to your question about the spleen, seems to be that the liver is a more important and bigger organ so that even though the spleen is on the left side (as the mishna says \"suspended within it\") the liver would override it in importance and cause its side to be called gadol.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Saying Pesukei DiZimra after Davening\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one skips parts of <em>Pesukei DiZimrah</em> may he say them after Davening or once he skips that is it ? Also if he could , does he <strong>have to</strong> ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <strong>Tur</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim § 52</a>) brings a dispute about this. Someone asked <strong>Rav Netronai Gaon</strong> if they can skip Pesukei D'Zimra and say it after their prayers, and he responded no. Rather, they should say an abbreviated Pesukei D'Zimra, and <strong>not to say them after their prayers</strong>. The Tur then quotes his father the <strong>Rosh</strong> who simply says to say an abbreviated Pesukei D'Zimra, with no mention of what to do afterwards. The Tur finishes off by citing <strong>Rabbeinu Yonah</strong> that if one comes late, they can skip Pesukei D'Zimra, and then say it after their prayers, <strong>with its accompanying blessings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, the <strong>Beis Yosef</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.52.1?vhe=Orach_Chaim,_Vilna,_1923&lang=he&p2=Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.52.2.1&vhe2=Tur_Orach_Chaim,_Vilna,_1923&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad loc.</a>) understood Rav Netronai Gaon to be forbidding saying Pesukei D'Zimra after the prayers <strong>with their accompanying blessings</strong>, unlike the opinion of Rabbeinu Yonah. However, without the blessings, <strong>one <em>may</em> say them</strong>. The Beis Yosef brings from the <strong>Agur</strong> (§ 95) who suggests that Rav Netrunai Gaon agrees with Rabbeinu Yonah. The former is discussing someone who said at least part of Pesukei D'Zimra, and therefore they can't say any more after their prayers. The latter is discussing someone who skipped it entirely, so they can say it after they finish their prayers. However, the Beis Yosef infers from Rav Netronai Gaon's formulation that this is incorrect, and maintains his own understanding that with the blessings is forbidden, but without is permitted. His conclusion is not to say Pesukei D'Zimra after prayers with a blessing. It would seem though that he only <em>permits</em> one to say it afterwards, but <strong>doesn't require it</strong>, as he wrote at the beginning \"יכול לאמרם\".</p>\n<p>The <strong>Bach</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bach%2C_Orach_Chaim.52.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad loc.</a>) also understood Rav Netrunai Gaon not to care if one said part of Pesukei D'Zimra or skipped it entirely; one shouldn't say it after the prayers. If the person already said part of it, then there's no need to complete it afterwards, as they've fulfilled their obligation. If they skipped it entirely, they still shouldn't say it, as it's disrespectful to Hashem to praise Him after asking Him for our needs. The Bach also disagrees with the Beis Yosef and says it doesn't matter if one says it with the blessings or not, Rav Netrunai Gaon would say not to say it. He then infers from the Rosh's silence that he disagrees with Rav Netrunai Gaon, and <strong>would allow saying Pesukei D'Zimra after the prayers</strong>, since they're being said without a blessing. It's simply like reading Torah verses, <strong>not reciting Hashem's praises</strong>. The Bach rules like this, and also rules against Rabbeinu Yonah.</p>\n<p>So far we haven't seen any sources which <strong>require</strong> making it up after prayers, just those that either allow or disallow it.</p>\n<p>Now, the <strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.52.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 52:1</a>) rules that if one comes late to say an abbreviated Pesukei D'Zimra, and then says if there's no time for that then to <strong>skip it entirely, and then say it after prayers without any blessing.</strong> This would sound obligatory, but it sounds like he's only referring to the latter case. I don't see from this Shulchan Aruch any obligation to make anything up <em>if part of Pesukei D'Zimra was said</em>. However, as I pointed out, the Beis Yosef didn't sound like anything was obligatory. This is the understanding of the <strong>Aruch HaShulchan</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.52.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad loc. § 4</a>), that when the Shulchan Aruch said to repeat (at the very least in the latter case), it's to give permission, but not obligatory. He says the same would be true for someone who said part of it, that they can say the rest afterwards <strong>if they want</strong>, like any other verse in the Torah.</p>\n<p>However, the Aruch HaShulchan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.52.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad loc. § 5</a>) disagrees with the Beis Yosef's reading of Rav Netrunai Gaon, and agrees with the Bach's reading. He is concerned for his opinion, and therefore says <strong>it's better not to recite anything after praying</strong>. He adds that this is the opinion of the Kabbalists.</p>\n<p>Now, who <em>does</em> say one <em>must</em> make it up? I saw the <strong>Chayei Adam</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Adam.19.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19:5</a>) says to make up what you skipped afterwards without the blessings. That seems definitive, although maybe one could say the Aruch Hashulchan's reading here too that it's merely permission (although כל מה שדילג יאמר אחר התפלה does sound obligatory). The <strong>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.14.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:7</a>) seems to say the same. I also saw <strong>Rav Chaim Kanievsky</strong> in his Orchos Yosher § תפילה write that one must say everything skipped after davening, \"as it says in the Shulchan Aruch\". Not sure if this is a <em>halchic</em> statement or just a <em>mussar</em> one, given the nature of the work. Although, he does write in his <strong>Shoneh Halachos</strong> (52:7) that one should say everything they skipped (כל מה שמדלג יאמר אחר התפילה).</p>\n<p>The <strong>Piskei Teshuvos</strong> (ad loc. § 3 fn. 36) brings from <strong>Orach Neeman</strong> (ad loc.  § 2) by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F_%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%A2_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%9A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Menachem Nosson Notta Auerbach</strong></a> (an associate of Rav Kook) who says נכון להשלים, that it is proper to make up whatever was skipped. However, looking in the <em>sefer</em> inside, I saw no such statement. Piskei Teshuvos (fn. 37) also cites <strong>Az Nidberu</strong> (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/16642/p/90/t/3097670841234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:45</a>) by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%96%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Binyamin Yehoshua Zilber</strong></a> (an associate of the <strong>Chazon Ish</strong>). He says that although if one said part of Pesukei D'Zimra, they have fulfilled their obligation, נכון להחמיר, it is proper to be stringent and make up the rest later. However, he says if the person has some sort of אונס, or they're caught up in their learning, they can be lenient.</p>\n<p>Finally, DoubleAA referenced a <em>maamar</em> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Henkin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Yehuda Herzl Henkin</strong></a>, in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20024&st=&pgnum=196&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Benei Banim</strong> III</a>. He seems to have a third understanding of Rav Netrunai Gaon, and brings support from Teshuvos HaGeonim II p. 22. He finishes off by saying that people today come to shul late with the intent to skip most of Pesukei D'Zimra. <strong>Therefore, we should tell them to finish Pesukei D'Zimra afterwards</strong>. His usage of the word \"therefore\" implies to me that he agrees that there's no actual obligation, just that if we tell people they have to (as he sees no problem making it up later), they'll stop relying on skipping Pesukei D'Zimra, which isn't appropriate.</p>\n<p>In summary, the only ones I found who seem to hold there's an obligation to make anything up are the Chayei Adam, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, and Rav Chaim Kanievsky, perhaps based on the simple reading of the Shulchan Aruch (against what he implies in his Beis Yosef). Az Nidberu does say to be <em>stringent</em>, but I didn't see his reasoning. Rav Henkin also says people should, but seemingly for pragmatic reasons. The rest hold one could if they want, and the Aruch HaShulchan says it's better not to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch in siman 52 says to say pesukei dezimra if you came late and had to skip it.

Please forgive any ignorance or mistakes on my part.</p>\n\n<p>I was reading a small debate in online comments. One person was asking another why 'G-d' was written as such in an article. The other person replied that that was how observant Jews spell the name of G-d, because it is forbidden to speak it. A person then asked why that ruled applies to this word, because it was an English word, and not the Hebrew name, and anyways, it's not the 'name' of G-d, because it's also used to references other gods, such as Zues, whose actual names are Zues, Hera, etc., so it can't be a name specific to G-d. It more refers to the being, or however one would accurately describe G-d, the first person argued.</p>\n\n<p>Which got me to thinking, what sort of name is the Tetragrammaton? Is it a personal name, like my name might be 'Mike'? Or does it refer to the sort of 'thing' that G-d is, the same way that 'gods' of various religions are all the same type of thing, the same way I could be referred to as a person? (though the Hebrew G-d would be unique, having no peers)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In our Torah, God is referred to by multiple names and appellations.

As G-d's personal name, so to speak, rather than a description, it is never pronounced the way it is written except by the high priest in the holy Temple.

This name is also never to used to describe any being or phenomena except the God of the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>One of the 7 names is \"Elohim\". It literally means \"god\" or \"power\", and can be used to refer to the Almighty, idols or foreign \"gods\", as well as angels and powerful people. This name has a unique rule. When used to refer to God, it is holy. When used to refer to someone else, it is not holy. The word can go either way depending on context. The same would apply to using God to refer to the Jewish God, or god to refer to the foreign gods of the nations. In the former context it may be holy, in the latter it is definitely not.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, there is no absolute requirement to spell God as G-d, as there is no prohibition of writing God's name. Many observant people do spell His name as G-d as an extra protection. There is also a prohibition of erasing G-d's name that may be mitigated by spelling it G-d, but that likely does not apply to \"writing\" on a computer screen. </p>\n\n\n",

So for all practical purposes one has to say <em>Barukh Hamavdil ben kodesh le hol</em> before doing any work. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13924/11501\">here</a> for a related MY discussion</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now when you are calling someone who didn't make havdala, he is not transgressing a melacha</strong> (forbidden Shabbat work) of Shabbat because Shabbat has ended for him even if he didn't do havdala. He is \"only\" transgressing the interdiction of not doing work before hadvala. The Shmirat Shabat Kehilchata (59:8 in vol 3, p. 938) explicitly allows this</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One is allowed to benefit when somebody who is not shomer mitzvot and does not make Havdalah performs, after Shabbat, an activity forbidden on Shabbat, e.g., traveling on a bus with a Jewish driver who did not make Havdalah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He brings an interesting idea to wish that person \"Shavua tov\" with the intent he might reply the same and so perhaps fulfill at least his basic obligation to make Havdala (i.e., acknowledging Shabbat has ended).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbienkin.com/bookstore/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Ari Enkin in Da'at v'din</a> (p. 52) brings additional sources saying the same, e.g., Tzitz Eliezer 11:34, 14:34, Rivevot Ephraim 8:118:9</p>\n\n<p>Remains the question whether you can \"actively trigger\" that interdiction by calling someone after shabbat when you know he hasn't done havdala. It might be a case of <em>lifnei iver lo titen michshol</em> (\"do not put an obstacle in front of the blind\"). However if there was such an interdiction, practically, an observant Jew couldn't interact with any non-observant Jew.

But it hasn't happened yet in actuality. The language of Onkelos appears to be emphasizing a point that there is still some degree of choice by Pharaoh. In other words, if it actually comes to pass, then I would do this.</p>\n\n<p>And this is also the emphasis from Shemot 8:11 and 8:28. In the early plagues, Pharaoh had no choice. But in a later stage, he was given the opportunity to repent and he refused. And this caused the judgement of Mitzrayim.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam actually discusses this in Hilchot Teshuvah, chapter 6, halacha 3 specifically in regard to Pharaoh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/showtargum.php?bookname=02&chapter=3&verse=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon Project</a> (main website located at <a href=\"http://cal1.cn.huc.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cal1.cn.huc.edu</a>), the Aramaic word <strong>פון</strong> found here in this verse <a href=\"http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/prova.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">was a later editorial insertion</a>, which means that the word appeared above or below (or in the margin of) this verse among the traditional transcriptions of this Targum. In fact, according to the same source, there is no nuance of “the subjective mood” in the Targum Neofiti, the Pseudo-Jonathan, nor in the Samaritan Pentateuch.</p>\n\n<p>Why then did some later editors insert the word <strong>פון</strong> into this Targum? The following is my own translation of Exodus 3:19-20 from the Aramaic of this Targum. The word <code>in grey</code> would be the translation of the <strong>פון</strong> as intended by the Jewish editors who inserted this word in order to bring out the full meaning.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Ex 3:19-20</strong><br>\n  <sup>19</sup> And it is revealed before me (<em>lit</em>., was uncovered before me) that the King of the Egyptians will not let you go not even from before his strong army. <sup>20</sup> <code>notwithstanding</code> I will send the stroke of my might, and I will strike the Egyptians with my miracle (<em>lit</em>., my sacrifice [of the Passover]) to perform among them, and thus after this he will cast you away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verse 19 starts out with the Aramaic phrase “וּקדָמַי גְלֵי,” which means that the LORD is making the inviolate decree that Pharaoh is not going to budge -- the literal idea here is that there “was disclosed (or revealed) before the LORD” in predictive prophecy to Moses that Pharaoh was going to remain intransigent until the bitter end. Because of this inviolate decree of this predictive prophecy, verse 20 includes the editorial word <strong>פון</strong>, which tips the reader to understand <code>notwithstanding</code>, which lends to the idea that while Pharaoh will be forced to release the Israelites, it will not be as a result of his desire to release them.  In other words, Pharaoh will not change his mind <code>notwithstanding</code> that the Passover miracle is going to occur, which will <em>devastate</em> the Egyptians.</p>\n\n<p>Along this same line of thought, <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/BiblicalCommentaryOldTestament.KeilAndDelitzsch.6/01.BCOT.KD.PentateuchMoses.vol.1.Law.#page/n443/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">in their <em>Commentary of the Old Testament</em> - online</a>, the 19th Century Hebraists Karl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delizsch make the very same observation concerning the Biblical Hebrew of the Masoretic Text.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וְלֹא בְיָד חֲזָקָה</strong>, “not even by means of a strong hand;” “except through great power” is not the true rendering, for וְלֹא does not mean ἐὰν μὴ, <em>nisi</em>. What follows,—<em>viz</em>., the statement that God would so smite the Egyptians with miracles that Pharaoh would, after all, let Israel go (v. 20),—is not really at variance with this, the only admissible rendering of the words. <strong>For the meaning is, that Pharaoh would not be willing to let Israel depart even when he should be smitten by the strong hand of God; but that he would be compelled to do so against his will, would be forced to do so by the plagues that were about to fall upon Egypt.</strong> Thus even after the ninth plague it is still stated (Ex. 10:27), that “Pharaoh would (אבה) not let them go;” and when he had given permission, <strong>in consequence of the last plague</strong>, and in fact had driven them out (Ex. 12:31), he speedily repented, and pursued them with his army to bring them back again (Ex. 14:5ff.); from which it is clearly to be seen that the strong hand of God had not broken his will, and yet Israel was brought out by the same strong hand of Jehovah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, the Jewish scholars who translated Targum Onqelos into Aramaic used the nuance of <strong>פון</strong> to convey nuance in the Masoretic Text that Pharaoh was so intransigent that, <code>notwithstanding</code> divine power of the Passover miracle to the contrary, he was going to remain in his inveterate obstinacy until the bitter end.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Don't covet? Don't steal? What exactly is חמד in the Aseret Hadibrot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Aseret Hadibrot include a commandment against stealing ( לא תגנב) and one against adultery, and then later include לא תחמד, which is usually translated \"do not covet\" (including by JPS).  It then goes on to list the forbidden objects of this verb (your neighbor's house, wife, etc).  My question is about what exactly this means -- what is it that we are forbidden to do?  </p>\n\n<p>I'm taking it as a given (please correct if I'm wrong) that it has to be <em>different</em> from the other commandments in some way -- each word in torah is there to teach us something and we should not expect redundancy.  So, for example, if it's about action, it potentially conflicts with \"do not steal\" and \"do not commit adultery\", so those overlaps need to be resolved.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi (and, according to the JPS Miqra'ot G'dolot, the Ramban) resolves the overlap with stealing by saying that the earlier commandment is about kidnapping and the later one about theft, based on position in the list.  (The earlier one is listed with capital offenses; kidnapping is a capital offense too but theft is not.)  Neither says anything about adultery -- how is not stealing your neighbor's wife different from not committing adultery?</p>\n\n<p>I've heard some others say that the earlier commandments are about adultery and stealing (and that's consistent with גנב being about thievery in some later uses), and thus argue that the last is about intentions.  While the <em>mitzvot</em> overwhelmingly are about <em>actions</em>, not <em>thoughts</em>, we do have a couple other thought/feeling-based ones (don't hold a grudge, love God with all your heart, love your fellow as yourself).  Again according to the JPS Miqra'ot G'dolot, Hizkuni (whoever that is) says that \"don't covet your neighbor's wife\" is about neither mere thought nor adultery; rather, it means don't persuade her to divorce (which would make her available).  If Hizkuni addresses stealing it's not reported here.</p>\n\n<p>This Shabbat I heard a response to the \"covet\" (thought) understanding, in the name of Rabbi Joel Hoffman, arguing that it can't just mean \"covet\" or \"desire\" because that doesn't make sense when the word is used elsewhere.  He points to Sh'mot 34:24, where Yisrael is being commanded in the pilgrimage festivals and God tells them that they needn't worry about leaving their property unguarded -- וְלֹא-יַחְמֹד אִישׁ אֶת-אַרְצְךָ, no man shall (verb) your land.  Rabbi Hoffman argues that people can \"covet\" their land year-round, whether they're there or not, and in context this means they won't <em>take</em> it.  But if we follow that reasoning, we still have the adultery problem.</p>\n\n<p>Is לא תגנב about intentions or actions?  If actions, which ones and how do we address the overlap with other parts of the Aseret Hadibrot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrew Wikipedia</a> on לא תחמוד says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הלאו של לא תחמוד כולל את האיסור להוציא מן הזולת בתחבולות, ואף בתמורה\n  כספית נדיבה, דבר השייך לו. התחבולות האסורות כוללות: הפצרה חוזרת\n  ונישנית, לחץ חברתי וכמובן כח. העסקת המחשבות על תחבולות כאלו, אסורה גם\n  היא, ואפילו עצם ההתאוות לנכסי הזולת או הקנאה בהם נאסר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My free translation:\nלא תחמוד includes the prohibition of getting by tricks or devices, even in exchange for generous financial recompense, something that belongs to another person . Tricks prohibited include: repeated urging, peer pressure, and exercise of power .

If the owner is not known to you, then\n  you should bring the object into your house, where it shall remain\n  until the owner inquires after it, and you will return it to him. So\n  shall you do for his donkey, his garment, or any lost article that you\n  may find</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a nutshell</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>one has to announce the signs of the object you found for three regalim</strong> (i.e., up to a year, cf. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.28a.28?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna on BM 28a</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>one cannot use it in the interim unless it improves the object</strong> (e.g., the gmara gives the examples of unfolding a garment to keep it in good shape)</li>\n<li><strong>but one can use the object if the owner has given up on it</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.262.5?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see SA Choshen Mishpat 262:5</a>)</li>\n<li>otherwise one has to keep the object \"until Elyahu Hanavi comes\", be ready to return it and can use the object in the meantime</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One might ask if the laws of lost objects apply here as the object is not really lost, you know who it is coming from, etc. It might however provide the closest analogy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your case, since you have done all you can to inform the owner, it could be a case of the owner having abandoned the idea of finding it again therefore you can use it while being ready to return it if the owner asks. This assumes the object doesn't get destroyed by using it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whether this applies differently to non-Jews is a good question. The pasuk says \"to your brother\" but in the ways of \"darkei shalom\" of the Rambam we might extend this to all.

This would seem to possibly imply that the status quo assumption would be that they fetus should have gone free due to the damage to its eye.</p>\n\n<p>If someone would blind a fetus, or injure a fetus in some non-fatal way, would they owe anything for the damage that they did to the fetus? If so, to whom would they owe the money?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I didn't see anyone addressing this explicitly, but it seems to me from the subject matter there would be no monetary compensation for a damage to the fetus which does not result in the termination of the pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>See Bava Kama 49a with Rashi. When the mishna said the value of the fetus, that encapsulated the monetary benefit (to the woman) of the fetus. As such, reparations are deduced by calculating the value of a woman who is pregnant against her value when not pregnant, imagining the value of this woman if she were sold as a slave. And as Rashi explains, being pregnant makes her seem bigger and healthier so she is worth more monetarily. The Tur brings a different method of assessing the mother's value. We assess her as having been weakened more through a violent termination of the pregnancy and therefore worth less  than had she gone through a normal childbirth.</p>\n\n<p>But what we see is that the payment concerning the fetus has nothing to do with the value of the actual fetus itself, but rather the value of the woman as concerns the fetus. It is that difference in value of the woman, not the fetus's value, that gets paid. </p>\n\n<p>Being so, I will point out that a blind fetus still serves the purpose of making her look bigger and stronger due to her pregnancy, so there was no monetary loss as concerns the mother's value. She herself also did not become weaker from this act.</p>\n\n<p>A related clarification once we're on this topic: The Aruch HaShulchan in Ch'M 423 2 asks why don't we in fact assess the value of the fetus themselves? He answers that since every pregnancy carries a risk of miscarriage, no buyer pays for a fetus what he would pay for an already born infant. Therefore all assessments are made only concerning the mother. \nA similar idea is found in the Perisha as well.</p>\n\n\n",

From a later verse (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0128.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'reishis</em> 28:4</a>), it appears that the Rambam also excludes Esav himself from that category (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=15010\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hil.

As a result, they delayed until he was older. When he became older, he absolutely refused to become circumcized and his loss of the birthright cause him to be rejected. The mitzvah of circumcision became solely part of the mitzvos of Bnei Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Dov Kramer discusses this in his Dvar Torah on <a href=\"http://www.nachumsegal.com/taking-a-closer-look-at-parshas-vayishlach-with-rabbi-dov-kramer-5776/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parshas Vayishlach</a> However, he points out that even those who say that Eisav was circumcised (whether at eight days or later) and that his descendants continued it, agree that he rejected it once Yitzchak died.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Targum Yonasan says that Yaakov’s fear was based on Eisav having the\n  merit of honoring his father.

Since Eisav was very red when he was\n  born, Yitzchok thought it would be dangerous to circumcise him on the\n  eighth day. After a year or two, when his color remained the same,\n  Yitzchok realized that this was Eisav’s natural complexion so he could\n  be circumcised, but decided that since he didn’t circumcise him when\n  he was eight days old, he would wait until he was 13, the same age\n  Yishmael was at his circumcision (see 17:25). However, when Eisav\n  turned 13, and Yitzchok wanted to circumcise him, Eisav refused.</p>\n  \n  <p>It should be noted that not everyone agrees that Eisav was never\n  circumcised, as Tana D’vay Eliyahu (24) says Esaiv’s descendants kept\n  the mitzvah of circumcision until Yitzchok died, and Agadas B‘reishis\n  (58:4) says that Eisav was circumcised by his parents, but\n  subsequently rejected it (see also Pirkay d’Rebbe Eliezer 29 and\n  B’reishis Rabbah 63:13).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2819784/jewish/Questions-and-Answers-on-Toldot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad.org</a> also says this</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to the Gemara (Chullin 47b), when a child is born red, a\n  brit cannot be performed on him until the blood in his veins settle\n  down. Consequently, when Eisav was born, he was too red to be\n  circumcised. When he became older and returned to a normal complexion,\n  his father wanted to circumcise him, but Eisav refused.</p>\n  \n  <p>(שער בת רבים - שפתי כהן, ועי' ילקוט שמעוני)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Breishis Rabbah 76:08 it says there that HaShem said, \"You refused to give your daughter (Dinah) to you circumcised brother (Aisov).

    "content": "# Why did God need to command the Jews not to kill?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a principle '<em>svara lamah li krah</em> i.e. if a certain idea is logical and self evident to the average healthy mind, the Torah does not need to teach that idea. Additionally, what seems to be correct behavior to the average healthy mind is itself binding, that is why people can be judged and punished by God before the giving of the Torah (the mabul, dor haflaga, etc.).\nThat being the case why does the Torah need to command not to kill? (and why does the Torah have to command us not to steal, to honor our parents, etc, etc, etc......)</p>\n\n<p>[As a source for the second point you can see the following article by Rav Avraham Grodzinski: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwwd92aBnfAuNG1qYkltS1lfR3M\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwwd92aBnfAuNG1qYkltS1lfR3M</a> ]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>A Medrash states that G-d offered the Torah to the children of Eisau. They rejected it, saying they could not accept this very commandment against murder. This begs the question: Eisau's descendants also have a law against murder! Why couldn't they accept G-d's law if it was already illegal by their own standard?</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg ZT\"L answers as follows: Once something is a mitzvah, it becomes a G-d-given absolute standard not subject to human interpretation or moralistic reasoning. One can no longer legalize certain forms of killing that fall within one's moral standard. It's no longer possible to allow abortion, or \"mercy killing\" of the old and infirm. One cannot assassinate for a good cause, or to achieve power. Unlike svara-based avoidance of murder, G-d-based prohibition means that it is forbidden in all cases dictated by Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik tz\"l gave a similar explanation. (Speaking from my father's and my own testimony, heard on separate occasions. -@MichaBerger) Just as chukim, the laws that are beyond human understanding (such as that of the Red Heiffer), have elements we can explain, so too every mishpat, comprehensible law, has elements of choq that are beyond us. Using our natural moral compass alone, could we know whether the concept of \"murder\" should include euthanasia? Whether life ends with the end of some specific aspect of brain activity -- which one? -- or with the end of breath and/or heartbeat? Or when life begins -- is abortion murder, perhaps only after some part of gestation? May one turn over a single victim to an marauder band to save the rest of the community? Etc... All of those moral questions require a rigorous halachic structure to find an approach toward resolution.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>If not for the prohibition, murder would carry no defined penalty in civil courts. The Torah prohibition makes murder always a capital crime. Same with stealing - if there was no explicit mitzvah, there would not be a set punishment entrusted to earthly courts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He went to a Gadol Hador (great Rabbi) to ask him for advice and the Rabbi told him not to do the surgery (the article then says that later the doctor came and told the man it is good thing you didn't do the surgery because we now realize it would have been too risky).</p>\n\n<p>Is it permissible to listen to a Rabbi and go against the medical advice of a doctor?</p>\n\n<p>Please provide sources to go along with your answer. Responsa directly talking about this topic would be optimal.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://torahandscience.blogspot.com/2006/04/maharik.html\">Maharik</a> as well as the <a href=\"http://torahandscience.blogspot.com/2006/04/shevut-yaakov.html\">Shevus Yaakov</a> bring the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.22b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\">Gemara in Niddah</a> to prove that, on the contrary, Chazal would rely on the doctor's prognosis even in cases of potential Kares. Indeed, as the <a href=\"http://torahandscience.blogspot.com/2006/04/rambam.html\">Rambam</a> and many others point out, the Rabbi's knowledge of the sciences was certainly not all-incorporative, and drew upon modern (at the time) science for it's data. Even the <a href=\"http://torahandscience.blogspot.com/2006/04/chazon-ish.html\">Chazon Ish</a> pointed out that the Torah list of Treifos (disqualifying blemishes in an animal) is inaccurate to our current medical knowledge, and that Chazal were not as advanced medically as we are today.</p>\nTherefore, to blatantly reject a doctor's opinion certainly seems to go against the method that Chazal have provided us. </p>\nNow, I do understand that there may be discrepancy in areas of medicine where there really is no clear answer, and we don't know the results of a given surgery. But this is surely the general outline of the approach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The article in question was poorly reported, according to one of the commenters who claims to personally know the one who asked the opinion of the Gadol. According to him, the doctors were not firmly behind the procedure to start with!  So we should be discussing the issue of Safek/doubt. That issue is discussed in the Eighth Perek of Maseches Yoma, regarding one who is doubtful if he has the strength to fast on Yom Kippur. There, it discusses three scenarios:</p>\n\n<p>(1) if a doctor states that it could be dangerous, he should not fast.</p>\n\n<p>(2) if doctors disagree, then we follow the majority informed opinion.</p>\n\n<p>(3) If, however, doctors say that he is able to fast and the patient says he is not able to fast, then even if 100 doctors state categorically that he can fast, halachically he shouldn't fast because \"Adam yodeya tzaras nafsho.\" A person knows the trouble of his soul/body.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, a nursing book (sorry, no reference available) referred to a \"new theory\" of treating patients. Rather than the old days, when the Doctor was The Word, and whatever he said, went without question, it is best to tap into the patient's knowledge and include his opinion. I believe this is what was occurring here.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have had doctors disagree somewhat and in one case radically, with my own care. My quality of life would have been severely hampered for the 4-5 years if I would have followed one doctor. That doctor had advised me to go to a second doctor (Dr AR) for a bone marrow transplant. The 2nd doctor said, \"you are doing well, the transplant is life threatening, why get involved?\" Eventually the two doctors wanted me to take a therapy 2x or 3x monthly, for my rare condition but doesn't have a definite medical protocol that was similar to another condition for which monthly therapy was the protocol. I agreed at first. Then I had an idea. The first doctor told me \"I have no time. Dr AR is a good doctor. He said twice monthly so we will follow him! See you Monday.\" And hung up, not allowing me to express my idea. Concerned, I called Dr AR and presented my idea and he said, \"Good idea!\" We followed that protocol for 4-5 years and need only 3 months of that therapy.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, the need for every procedure is not clear. There is no such thing as \"settled science.\" Science by definition is not settled. Procedures that were absolutely essential yesterday may be declared dangerous tomorrow (for instance, the statins controversy, among many many others.)</p>\n\n<p>And some doctors are incredibly arrogant. My father in law had a stroke. He had difficulty responding to most everything. The doctor tried to convince me almost immediately that he was a vegetable, that he couldn't even hear. When he said that, I knew he was wrong. I had put tefillin on and said Ashrei with him daily. He was of Sefardi background. When I reached \"Po'tey'ach et yadecha...,\" he Always consistently lifted his hands and turned his palms upwards, for seven months after his stroke, until a few days before he passed away. He also responded to my children's names the day before passed away.</p>\n\n<p>Doctors are wonderful. But they have many inconsistencies, disagreements and they sometimes do questionable things. Being proactive in your care or even having an alternate opinion, or going to talk over a concern or clouded opinion/decision with a great man is not a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n",

The whole hetter (permission) to return a poor man's money is to encourage the poor man to do a rather expensive mitzvah that he might feel unable to do. Rather than push it off, Chazal permitted the Kohen to let him do the mitzvah and then, free-willingly,the Kohen returns the money so that the poor man can use it.</p>\n\n<p>As for a kohen who has a set of five silver dollars to sell to the father and then the father uses them for the Pidyon (see above answer), the idea is to use five coins at the Pidyon, as the simple reading of the Torah prescribes. As pointed out (by Double AA), though, the bottom line is coins must be used that have intrinsic value of approximate 117 grams of silver. Five U.S. silver dollars (or ten US half dollars) satisfy that. The idea of having coins always available and selling them to the father helps because those silver coins haven't been minted for almost 50 years and it becomes increasingly difficult to find them. So if the Kohen has five ready for use, it makes it easier to do the mitzvah. But still, the coins have no kedushah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do all Yemenites study the trope for each weekly parsha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard that in Yemenite synagogues, when a person is called for aliyah L'Torah, they read their own section. I.e., there is no \"Torah reader\" as there are in many other synagogues / services.</p>\n\n<p>This makes me speculate that each person needs to know how to read each parsha. Do people know in advance which aliyah they will receive on Shabbat / Yom Tov so that they can study their part in advance? Or, are people called randomly, and they have to be ready for any aliyah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>i have read regarding this question of yours that the Tradition in Yemen was that in every family, on the Friday night preceeding the Sabbath, the father would teach his sons the weekly Parashath with te'amim, and have them read it back to them, teaching them all the melody and the wording. So that way when the child was of Bar Miswah age, he was already proficient with every Parashath and could read without need of a special teacher (although some were still hired if the family wanted to.) And this meant that every person called up was already proficient with every Parashath since he had been reading them with te'amim since childhood. i plan on attempting this custom. Check back with me in 20 years and i'll let you know how it worked out.</p>\n\n<p>For a more detailed accounting, Rabbi Jacob Saphir published his travels to Yemen in 1866 in the book אבן ספיר. Here is an excerpt as given by the blog \"On the Main Line\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He began this section noting that the Yemenite Jews all know how to read the Torah most correctly, with its proper syllables and accents and cantillation. He relates that up to the present the holy custom or earlier times, which is really the law in its most proper manner, is that all who are called to the Torah read it themselves - if one cannot read then he is not called to the Torah. For this reason the first thing they teach their small children is to read the Torah in this way, to the point where they literally have it memorized. In addition, they still have the venerable custom of old of publicly translating the Torah as it is read. They employ a 9 or 10 year old boy for this purpose, who translates each verse as it is read from the Torah. They do this also for the haftarah, which is read with a most beautiful tune. He also notices that they are extremely exacting in their reading, whether it is Bible, Targum or their studies in other books - in all these each syllable and accent and jot are read beautifully, as in [what Saphir imagines/ assumes] days of old. At one point Saphir relates something that amazed him, but was apparently perfectly normal. One shabbat (or should I say shabboth?) there was a want of a manuscript to read the haftarah. So the 18 year old cobbler who was serving him recited it (from 2 Kings 7) perfectly by heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2010/11/saphirs-1850s-account-of-yemenite.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2010/11/saphirs-1850s-account-of-yemenite.html</a></p>\n\n<p>However, in modern times, Yemenites come in all shapes and sizes and are often separated from their Mesorah. There is a Yemenite man at my synagogue who was raised by his Ashkenazi mother, and so he no longer has a Yemenite pronunciation, and sings with Ashkenazi melody.</p>\n\n\n",

This name relates to converting 'Gevurot' to 'Chassadim' which is why this would be related to the 10 days of teshuvah, meaning from Rosh HaShanah to Yom Kippur. The gematria of 'Gevurah' (גבורה) is 216. While the gematria of 'Chesed' (חסד) is 72.

(Not sure what the standard name for a female convert is.) It is my understanding that said name represents the goy's acceptance of God, the Torah and the Oral Tradition. As such, the ger is considered Abraham-like.</p>\n<p>Since a ger (convert) is considered fully Jewish, does that not imply that they too have a place in the Land of Israel? If so, are converts granted tribal affiliation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>No. At present, male Gerim and their male children do not have an inheritance in the Land of Israel. Property is inherited paternally.</p>\n<p>Male converts do not become a part of any of the twelve tribes. Thus, their male children do not have a portion in the Land as of now. This was a case decided by the court of Moshe Rabbeinu and mentioned in the written Torah according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10-12?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's commentary. (See VaYikra 24:10-12</a> for details.) Rather, they are part of the congregation or community of Israel (עדת ישראל, קהלת ישראל).</p>\n<p>This gives them the status of representing the whole (הצבור) nation, not just themselves. Like Kohanim, the other group that represents the whole of the Jewish people, they do not possess an inheritance in the Land.</p>\n<p>This concept is mentioned in Midrash HaGadol (Volume 8 of Mossad HaRav Kook edition, parshat Pinchas 26:54-56, pp. 459-460; see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.122a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Bathra 122a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ein_Yaakov%2C_Bava_Batra.8.17?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ein Yaacov to Bava Bathra 8:17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.773.7?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah, parshat Pinchas 773:7</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.29.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni to Nach 29:1</a>), which says that in the future, the converts will become a 13th tribe. This is alluded to in Yechezkel's prophecy (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.48.18-19?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">48:18-19</a>), concerning the structure of the third Temple. The prophecy refers to an unnamed group called \"the city workers\" (העבדי העיר) who will be given a special piece of land in Israel that is contributed by all of the tribes together.</p>\n<p>They are recognized as converts because of their title (<strong>ה</strong>עבדי <strong>ה</strong>עיר). The double 'ה' symbolizes their status as converts, as is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.22-23?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 5:21-22</a> regarding 'Ben Bag Bag' and 'Ben Heh Heh'. They were both children of converts. It is no accident their mention follows <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.20?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 5:20</a>, which concludes with \"May it be Your will, L-rd, our G-d and G-d of our fathers, that the Temple will be rebuilt speedily in our days, and our portion in Your Torah is given.\" The juxtaposition indicates that converts won’t have a portion in the Land until that time.</p>\n<p>This double 'ה' alludes to the 'ה' that was added to the names of Avraham and Sarah when they made the covenant with G-d. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.1-8?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 17:1–8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.15-16?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 15–16</a> for details.)</p>\n<p>It is worth pointing out that this only applies to male converts. When a woman marries, she takes on the tribal status of her husband. If a convert marries a man of a particular tribe, she and all her descendants are members of that tribe, and are thus allotted a portion in the land of that tribe.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why can't a woman demand a divorce?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The halacha as I understand it is that only the man can take the final decision on divorce. I hear there are workarounds, but conceptually - why is that so?</p>\n\n<p>Why can't a woman decide by herself to divorce?</p>\n\n<p>Someone asked in the office, I had no answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The woman can <strong>ask</strong> but the torah specifies that the man must write (order the writing of) the divorce document and deliver it to her. There are cases in which the court can order the man to write the get, but he must be the one to write it (or order it written) and it must be of his own free will. This is similar to the rules of getting married in which the man must give the woman the ring (or other object) in order for the wedding to be valid.</p>\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that the methodology of a divorce <strong>must</strong> be similar to the methodology of the marriage. Just as the man must give the wife an object and \"take\" her into his house, similarly he must be the one to sever that relationship.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first act קידושין ... is the personal adoption of the wife by the\nhusband. ... and is further explained in Kidushin 2a, this adoption is\nmade in the form of an act of appropriation</p>\n<p>... the complete unity of the wife with the person of her husband is\nnot yet completed, but is conditional on another act ... chupah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that just as the Bnei Yisrael at Har Sinai gave themselves up to the authority of the Torah, the woman has given up her authority to separate from the husband and the marriage can <strong>only</strong> be ended by death and divorce.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of these laws can be summarised in one idea: the written word is\nto be used in the place of the spoken one, instead of a speech made\nwith full considered conscious intention, the thought of divorce must\nbe expressed in writing with equal import of its import and\nintention., ...</p>\n<p>... By depositing the deed of divorce in any place that is her domain\n... the husband gives up any rights he has in it ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further Rav Hirsch points out</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושלחה מביתו is simply the expression used here for the legal effect of\nthe act of divorce: the freeing of the marriage bond which hitherto\nwas in force, and the releasing of the belonging to the husband</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is exactly the inverse of the sealing of the original marriage bond.</p>\n<p>Rav Hirsch also points out it was after more than two thousand years that there was on the whole no abuse of that authority and it was not \"progress\" that it was found necessary to curtail that authority to protect the woman. He then refers to an article that he wrote on the Position of Jewish Women. See the article in volume 2 of \"Judaism Eternal\".</p>\n<p>This means that the woman cannot \"decide on her own\" to divorce. Even in cases in which the woman can go to bais din to force the husband to grand a divorce, the husband must still write and deliver the get. The technical methodology <strong>requires</strong> that the initiative come from the husband.</p>\n<p>As an example, we see the Rambam. Note that this does not say that the halacha of maus is accepted by everyone. I am giving it to show that even in this case, the technical requirement still applies.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952888/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Fourteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Ishus 14:8</a> points out that a woman can force the divorce to occur by acting in such a way as to be in the status of \"moredes\", that is, a rebellious wife, such as taking a vow to have no relations with the husband. In that case, the husband must divorce her, though she does not receive the kesuvah. However, the technical methodology <strong>requires</strong> that the initiative come from the husband.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A woman who withholds marital intimacy from her husband is called a\nmoredet (\"a rebel\"). She is asked why she has rebelled. If she\nanswers: \"Because I am repulsed by him and I cannot voluntarily engage\nin relations with him,\" her husband should be compelled to divorce her\nimmediately. For she is not like a captive, [to be forced] to engage\nin relations with one she loathes.14</p>\n<p>[In such an instance, as part of] the divorce [settlement], she does\nnot receive any of the money promised her in her ketubah.15</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957707/jewish/Gerushin-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Gerushin 2:20</a>states that the court can order the man coerced until he says \"I am doing this of my own free will\" because of the principle that any Jew wants to obey the Torah. However, if he does not say this, the divorce is invalid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a man whom the law requires to be compelled to divorce his wife51\ndoes not desire to divorce her, the court should have him beaten until\nhe consents, at which time they should have a get written. The get is\nacceptable. This applies at all times and in all places.52</p>\n<p>Similarly, if gentiles beat him while telling him: \"Do what the Jews\nare telling you to do,\" and the Jews have the gentiles apply pressure\non him until [he consents] to divorce his wife, the divorce is\nacceptable. If, however, the gentiles compel him to write [a get] on\ntheir own initiative, the get is [merely] unacceptable.53The rationale\nis that the law requires him to give a divorce.</p>\n<p>Why is this get not void? For he is being compelled - either by Jews\nor by gentiles - [to divorce] against his will [and a get must be\ngiven voluntarily].</p>\n<p>Because the concept of being compelled against one's will applies only\nwhen speaking about a person who is being compelled and forced to do\nsomething that the Torah does not obligate him to do - e.g., a person\nwho was beaten until he consented to a sale,54 or to give a present.\nIf, however, a person's evil inclination presses him to negate [the\nobservance of] a mitzvah or to commit a transgression, and he was\nbeaten until he performed the action he was obligated to perform, or\nhe dissociated himself from the forbidden action, he is not considered\nto have been forced against his will. On the contrary, it is he\nhimself who is forcing [his own conduct to become debased].55</p>\n<p>With regard to this person who [outwardly] refuses to divorce [his\nwife] - he wants to be part of the Jewish people, and he wants to\nperform all the mitzvot and eschew all the transgressions; it is only\nhis evil inclination that presses him. Therefore, when he is beaten\nuntil his [evil] inclination has been weakened, and he consents [to\nthe divorce], he is considered to have performed the divorce\nwillfully.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Your question uses some ambiguous language. You asked \"Why can't a woman decide by herself to divorce?\"  The answer to your question depends on what you mean by \"can't.\"</p>\n\n<p>On a simple level, the Torah lays out the procedure for divorce. Part of that procedure is the husband writing a bill of divorce (called a <em>get</em>) and giving it to the wife. When we understand that this is the procedure for divorce, it becomes obvious why it is impossible for a woman to decide on her own to get a divorce: the necessary steps to achieve divorce are not all within her own power. Her husband must comply to some extent.  According to one interpretation of your question, the above is the answer.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, you might be asking one step further: \"Why does the procedure for divorce require a step that is outside of the power of the wife to effect?\" This question is not so easily answered. God doesn't tell us the reason for the vast majority of the <em>mitzvot</em> in the <em>Torah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that there are cases where a woman <em>can</em> demand and a <em>beit din</em> can compel the man to divorce his wife. According to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/560111/jewish/The-Wifes-Grounds-for-Divorce.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> on Chabad.org, these cases include neglect of basic marital needs, physical and/or emotional abuse, unbearable circumstances, childlessness, refusal to make <em>aliya</em> if she wants to, and refusal to engage in marital relations. As I mentioned above, the husband still must produce a <em>get</em> for the divorce to take effect; however, in any of these cases, failure to do so is a violation of <em>halakha</em>. A <em>beit din</em> may even impose corporal punishment on the man until he divorces his wife.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A woman can't ask for a divorce because the stipulations in the Torah, and the halacha do not grant her the power to ask for a divorce. For more details on that, read everyone else's answers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>However, women were given the power to initiate divorce during the time of the Geonim.</strong> During the time of the Geonim, women were granted the power to initiate divorce by having a divorce clause inserted into the kethubbah. This may sound strange to Ashkenazim as their kethubboth have been a fixed text for nearly a millenia. But in the times of the Talmud, until this very day, Mizrahi Jewish communities have a custom of drafting kethubboth unique to their marriage, stipulating things down to the smallest details. One such clause that was in use during the time of the Geonim was one that allowed women to initiate divorce, and therefore forfeiting her kethubbah money. Here is a complete divorce clause that was brought to light in the Cairo Genizah:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f8s0c.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f8s0c.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...And if this Maliha [the bride] hates this Sa`id, her husband, and desires to leave his home, she shall lose her ketubbah money, and she shall not take anything except that which she brought in from the house of her father alone; and she shall go out by the authorization of the court and with the consent of our masters, the sages...” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/jewish-marriage-in-palestine-a-cairo-genizah-study/oclc/9761777\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jewish marriage in Palestine : a Cairo Genizah Study</a></p>\n\n<p>The witnesses of these Kethubboth were often high ranking scribes and Rabbis of the time, which shows they were not fringe occurrences. This clause allowed the women to sidestep the requirement of receiving permission of her husband, or requiring him to give her a get. She would go to the beit din, and have them dissolve the marriage, without needing anything from the husband. Giving her equal power in dissolving a marriage.</p>\n\n<p>So the more complete answer to your question is as follows: women cannot initiate divorce  because we as a community have decided not to allow them to do so, and when discoveries like the above kethubboth are found, we suppress them, rather than bring them back into common usage to solve problems like agunoth. A problem we historically already had an answer for.</p>\n\n\n",

After permission to give the get ba'al korchah is revived (and in the case of sickness, with the stipulation that the husband commits to caring for his first wife's medical needs), the first wife is written a get which is taken in custody by the Beis Din to give to the first wife when she is able to take it.

Depending on how the sentence is stressed, it could be spelled with a <em>holam</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0601.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yehoshua 1:16</a> is an interesting example that contains the word כל twice, spelled each way once.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַֽיַּעֲנ֔וּ אֶת־יְהוֹשֻׁ֖עַ לֵאמֹ֑ר כֹּ֤ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוִּיתָ֨נוּ֙ נַֽעֲשֶׂ֔ה וְאֶֽל־כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּשְׁלָחֵ֖נוּ נֵלֵֽךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the trope marks seem to appear just as squares here, but the first instance of the word כל has a <em>mahpakh</em> trope under it which indicates that the word is stressed as its own word. Since it is a stressed, closed syllable, the vowel is a <em>tenuah gedola</em>: in this case a <em>holam</em>. The second instance of כל does not have a trope associated with it; the word is simply attached to the following word אשר. Here כל is an unstressed closed syllable, so it takes a <em>tenuah qetana</em>, here a <em>qamatz qatan</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's called a kamatz katan and makes the same sound as a cholam according to many pronunciation systems. Without getting too deep into the grammar, a kamatz kattan is the 'small' version of a cholam, and is used in place of a cholam in certain words, mainly when the word has a less important place of the sentence or is attached in phrase to another word.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>this is similar to the es ais difference. alone it is ais, but connected it is es. alone it is coal - with cholam, connected it is kawl - with kawmawtz kawtawn. there are a few exceptions where it is with kawmawtz gawdol, but  I would have to look them up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it really forbidden to bow more than 4 times a day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard from a Rabbi that the G'mara brings that you can't bow more than 4 times in a day. But how could this be true if one bowes multiple times in the Amidah, and one says Amidah three times a day?</p>\n\n<p>*Unfortunately I don't have the source of this. And my Rabbi wasn't completely sure about the Amidah dilemma.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I am not in a place to be able to check sefarim or give sources, but I think that the discussion is concerning the Amidah and it is referring to 4 times \"per Amidah.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Kohen Gadol would bow at every bracha ending. Chazal told us that this was appropriate only for the Kohen Gadol and everyone else should limit bowing to the four times per Amidah prescribed by Chazal. </p>\n\n<p>It is discussed in the Gemara and also in the ShA regarding some who had a custom to bow constantly during the Amidahs of the Aseres Yemei Teshuvah and the Poskim point out that if one wants to follow that custom he should still stand in an erect position before reaching the bracha portion of each of the 18 (19) blessings of the Amidah, except those 4 places.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are four places where we bow at the beginning or end of a blessing. Every time in the day that we reach those four places, we bow. It can be 3 times personally (up to 5 times on YK) plus our response to the Chazan repeating one of those places. </p>\n\n<p>The correct places to bend the knees and bow the head (and spine, unless one is elderly or weak) are as follows(Shulchan Aruch 113/1):</p>\n\n<p>(1&2) the first blessing of the Amidah, the blessing of the \"Avot\" [forefathers], beginning and end: when saying the words \"Baruch\" [bend the knees] \"Ata\" [bend the head and spine] \" then stand erect slowly as one says \"haShem [and continue with \"Elokeinu...\"] and the same by the ending: \"Baruch\" [bend the knees] \"Ata\" [Bend the head and spine] then stand erect slowly as one says \"haShem,\" and conclude \"Magen Avraham.\"](Shulchan Aruch 113/6,7)</p>\n\n<p>(3&4) the next to last blessing of the Amidah, the blessing of Hoda'ah [thanksgiving], beginning and end: bow the head and spine quickly \"like a bulrush\"(see Mishneh B'rurah 113/12) when saying the first five words, \"Modim anachnu lach shaw-Ata hu...\" And when saying the words \"Baruch,\" bend the knees, when saying \"Ata,\" bend the head and spine, then stand erect when saying \"haShem\" [and conclude the blessing with \"haTov shimcha, u'lcha na'eh l'hodot.\"]</p>\n\n<p>It is inappropriate to bend the knees at the beginning or at the end of any other blessing, including the last blessing, \"haMevorech et Amo Yisrael ba'shalom.\" </p>\n\n<p>However, we do bow as we walk back 3 steps, \"like a bulrush,\" for oseh shalom. Then, we bow to the left, then to the right and then forward, but no knee bending. Rabbi Heinemann of Baltimore said (asked personally today) that there is no issue of bending the knees when one does this last k'ree'ah. It is the same as the k'ree'ah of Modim.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Modim D'Rabbanan is said when we join the Chazan as he repeats the regular Modim. That counts as the 3rd place for which we bow. (The issue is not how many times rather how many Places we bow!) There are 3 different customs on how long to bow this time (see ShA 127/1 and Rema there) but the prevalent one in many circles is to follow the Vilna Gaon (Bi'ur HaGra, quoted in Bi'ur Halacha, 127 \"hakol b'sh'chiyah\" ) that we bow again \"like a bulrush\" for only the first 5 words and lift our head slowly as we say \"haShem.\" </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the 'plain meaning of the text'?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are four general categories of explanation to the Torah based on the acronym of 'Pardes\n'  פרדס, פשט רמז דרוש סוד.</p>\n\n<p>This is like is found by the Vilna Gaon in his commentary on Mishlei 1:21, the commentary of Ohr HaChaim on the Torah, Ki Thisa 32:6 beginning with the words, (כי לצד שהתורה יש בה ד׳ דרכים כלליים כו׳), Sefer Makor Chaim by Rabbi Shmuel Vital, drush 1 for Rosh Chodesh Sivan on Shir HaShirim 4:3, Sefer Eitz HaDa'at Tov of Rabbi Chaim Vital on parshat Netzavim with the words beginning (או ירמוז כי המצות כו׳), and Sha'ar HaGilgulim of Rabbi Yitzchok Luria, introduction 11 beginning with the words (דע כי האדם צריך שיקיים כל התרי״ג מצות)</p>\n\n<p>But this division of the Torah into these four categories is not some modern innovation. It is presented in a similar format but with further details in Shemot Rabbah 20:2-5 (מלה\"ד לאדם שהיה לו פרדס א\"ל חברו מכור לי את הפרדס הזה מכר) and 33:1 (ויקחו לי תרומה, הה\"ד (משלי ד) כי לקח טוב נתתי לכם תורתי אל תעזובו,)which compares the Torah to a garden with a well in the center from which flows a stream which divides into 4 branches and each branch waters a different part of the garden, raising 4 different categories of plants, olive trees, grape vines, pomegranates and spices. Shir HaShirim Rabbah 4:13:4 (ד\"א שלחיך פרדס רמונים שלחיך עתיד הקב\"ה לעשותך כפרדס רמונים לעתיד לבא,) explains how the source of the garden is the well and in 4:15 (מעין גנים באר מים חיים,) says that it is the source of the Halacha too. This theme is also repeated in Yalkut Shimoni on Pekudei 426 (והיו מימי הבאר יוצאין ונעשין נהרים נהרים.) and on Shir HaShirim 988 (מעין גנים, אמר ר' יוחנן מ\"ח פעמים כתיב בתורה מים חיים כנגד מ\"ח דברים שתורה נקנית בם,)in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.(רבי שמעון בן יוחאי משל למה הדבר דומה לאחד שנפל לו פלטורית בירושה,)</p>\n\n<p>'Peshat' is commonly translated as the 'plain meaning' or the 'simple meaning' of the text.</p>\n\n<p>This is like the usage of the word as found in Ketubot 111b, which says,\n\"פשטיה דקרא במאי כתיב\".</p>\n\n<p>But it also has a meaning of 'natural flow' like is found in Gittin 60b, which says, \"נהרא כפשטיה ליזיל\" and like Chullin 18b, which says, \"נהרא נהרא ופשטיה\".</p>\n\n<p>It also has a meaning of 'deduction', meaning to derive a conclusion from facts and general principles as found in Brachot 2b, which says, \"פשטו לה מברייתא\". As contrasted with homiletics (דרוש) which are aimed at an inspirational or moral theme.</p>\n\n<p>It also carries a meaning of 'skinning' or 'flaying', meaning to remove the surface and reveal what is underneath the surface, like is found in Mishnah Pesachin 5:9, which says, \"כיצד תולין ומפשיטין\".</p>\n\n<p>The commentary of Rashi on the Chumash is said to be commentary according to 'Peshat', like he says himself on Bereshit 3:8, which says, \"I didn't come except for the 'Peshat' of the written text and for Aggada that settles the text of the written Torah, 'a word spoken according to its way'.\"</p>\n\n<p>This comment about what purpose Aggada serves in his commentary is taken from Mishlei 25:11. On that Mishlei, Rashi emphasizes that it is relating to how the dikduk is used. That suggests that Rashi uses Aggada to understand proper grammar in order to arrive at the Peshat.</p>\n\n<p>ואני לא באתי אלא לפשוטו של מקרא ולאגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא, דבר דבר על-אופניו</p>\n\n<p>And he reiterates this again on Bereshit 3:24, \"There is Midrash Aggada and I don't come except for the 'Peshat'.</p>\n\n<p>מדרש אגדה יש ואני איני בא אלא לפשוטו</p>\n\n<p>This, in fact, is what is presented by Professor Yeshayahu Maori in his analysis of Rashi in the context of determining what makes up Peshat. See the following link for a detailed analysis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lookstein.org/articles/maori.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lookstein.org/articles/maori.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Professor Maori concludes that, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are three basic criteria according to which we can establish what is peshat and what is derash: (1) whether the explanation (and what follows it) is logically coherent; (2) whether it fits the context; and (3) whether it is compatible with the grammar of the language</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it as Professor Maori presents? Or is there more to what constitutes Peshat? What are the specific elements which comprise and make up the 'Peshat', the 'plain meaning' style of commentary? If possible, cite specific examples for each element.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there a halachic \"time limit\" between your emptying the box and mailing the check?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=4&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">RH 4a</a>) tells us that Tzedaka, like any other Neder, is included in the Biblical prohibition of <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.22?lang=he-en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bal Te'acher</a> (don't delay paying up your vows). However, unlike ordinary vows for sacrifices for which one does not violate unless they don't bring the sacrifice before 3 consecutive festivals have passed (Rambam Maaseh Korbanot 14:13), the Talmud tells us (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=6&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">RH 6a</a>) that for Tzedaka one needs to pay immediately for there are always poor people available. Rambam codifies this in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=6389\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matnot Aniyim 8:1</a>, noting that if there is no poor person available, one seperates the money and awaits a poor person. Tosfot (RH 4a) explains that while the 3-festival rule doesn't apply when there are needy people available, if there are no needy people then you have to seek them out before 3 festivals have elapsed. Rambam (ibid.) mentions no such distinction. The Tur (YD 257) quotes his father, Rosh, as arguing on the Rambam and ruling that if one were to stipulate at the time of the Neder that one should be allowed to distribute the money slowly to different people, that would avoid any of these limits.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6733\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Arukh YD 257:3</a> rules like the Rambam against Tosfot (see Shakh 5, Gra 6), and like the Rosh against the Rambam. However, in your case we need not worry about any of that, as the Rama there notes (my translation; bolding added):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה: וכל זה בצדקה שיש בידו לחלקה בעצמו <strong>אבל כשנודרין צדקה בבית הכנסת ליתנה ליד גבאי או שאר צדקה שיש לו ליתן לגבאי אינו עובר עליה אע\"ג דעניים מצויים אא\"כ תבעו הגבאי ואז עובר עליה מיד אי קיימי עניים והגבאי היה מחלק להם מיד ואם אין ידוע לגבאי צריך הוא להודיע לגבאי מה שנדר כדי שיוכל לתבעו</strong> ... ואם אמר אתן סלע לצדקה לפלוני אינו עובר עד שיבא אותו עני אע\"ג דשאר עניים מצויים:‏<br>\n  GLOSS: All this is by Tzedaka which is in his capability to distribute, <strong>but when they vow Tzedaka in synagogue to give to the hands of the Gabbai or other Tzedaka which one needs to give to the Gabbai [for distribution], he does not violate even if poor people are present unless the Gabbai sought [the money from] him, and then he violates it immediately if the poor people are present and the Gabbai would distribute to them immediately. If [his vow] was not known to the Gabbai, he must notify him so that he can seek [the money from] him.</strong> ... And if he says \"I will give a Sela to [a specific poor person\" he does not violate until that specific person comes, even if there are other poor people present.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems from this that not only are the people who put money in the box not bound by time limits, but the box manager too is not bound by any limit as it is not up to him to distribute the money. If the organization requests the money (the Shakh there states that until otherwise known we assume they need it for immediate use) then he must (a biblical obligation!) send it to them immediately. If they haven't requested the money (and he doesn't want to send it yet), he should notify them that the money is available so they can request it if they want. Seemingly, he can assume they don't want to be bothered with notifications for each coin dropped in.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have now seen (in R <a href=\"https://www.halachashiur.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aryeh Kerzner</a>'s Halacha at Home) an answer to your specific question.</p>\n<p>He first explains the Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.257.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> one shouldn't delay to give money which has been separated, and the Rema comments this doesn't apply to an organization until it asks for money, but a person who separated the money must inform them.</p>\n<p>However, in the case of a charity box</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is assumed that the organization clearly recognizes that the people\nplacing money in their <em>psuhkas</em> decide based on their own discretion\nwhen to deliver the money to the organization, and that is the\nimplicit agreement. <strong>Therefore, the obligation to inform the intended\nrecipient immediately does not apply.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I'll translate some of his points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The archaeological findings from the time of the Second Temple show, that in the architecture and the art of decoration of Jewish graves there was a strong Hellenistic influence, but even so, it was an entirely non-iconic art. On the faces of decorated graves and the hundreds of caskets and sarcophaguses that were discovered until now, there is not to be found even a single motif taken from the animal kingdom, only examples from the plant kingdom and geometrical shapes...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not familiar with pre-Hellenistic Jewish graves, but if there aren't images on such graves, then it seems that the origins of the decorations came from Hellenism. However, in those early days, the image subjects were kept in the boundaries of Halacha.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"At the turn of the 2nd century and mostly in the 3rd century CE, a complete turnaround happened, and a new leaf in the birth of Jewish art was turned...it seems, therefore, that the images in the Jewish catacombs in Rome, that in their time caused tremendous controversy because of the multitude of idolatrous subjects within them, were not a singular, passing phenomenon, but the birth of of a general evolution, that was rooted in in the influence of the general non-Jewish population of the area, on one hand, and in a relaxation of the Torah prohibition on the other hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In one [burial] cave there are buried rabbis and their families in dug graves and simple caskets, and next to them are buried other people (whose identities we do not know) in caskets decorated with images of humans and animals. Rabbis considered 'holy', who in their lifetime abstained from looking at a coin that had an image of a person, were buried in simple, non-decorated caskets next to Jews who were buried in caskets decorated with idolatrous-mythological imagery. It may be assumed that those buried in the pagan caskets were influenced greatly by the strange culture - a kind of 'advanced' Jews, and maybe even Hellenistic Jews. Even so, it seems that these were good Jews, for if not, they would not have requested to be carried from far-away to be buried in the cemetery where Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi was buried...a few researchers attempted to give an explanation to the phenomenon in different manners. There are those that attempted to explain that this bears witness to the existence of several cults in the nation whose faith was different from that of the sages, and therefore developed for themselves a system of symbols, that though was taken from the idolatrous world around them, but they gave those symbols different meanings...others attempted to explain the phenomenon with accordance to the acceptable Halacha, in light of the history of the relations between Jews and non-Jews in the land. To say, that the sages found here a place to be lenient for a variety of reasons...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"After this period, we do not find images of people or animals on tombs, more so, we do not even find any sort of decorations on the tombs, and the only thing on the tomb is the inscription. Later on, near the end of the 16th century, decorations and different images began to appear upon the tombs...in these cemeteries there are those that are carved with Tanachic imagery that are connected to the name of the deceased...I could not find rabbinical references to the phenomenon, and it appears, that the question never arose as an issue. As much as I have been able to find out, the first question on the matter was written only in the 19th century...it may also be said, that not everyone saw in this a Halachic question, because the cemetery was not considered in their eyes like a synagogue and a place of holiness, and therefore there was no need to be strict like in the synagogue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As we wrote above, the statues and the images on the tombs were related mainly to the name of the deceased. Although we have found those that are related to his profession...Rabbi Yosef [ben Naim] expanded on the idea, and in another place wrote:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It seems to me that it is needed to clarify on this...it shows that the deceased enjoyed his work...happy he was in this world and he will be in the next world...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>etc.</p>\n\n\n",

The view of Rabbi Yishmael is that they heard the first two statements which include all the others. They responded 'Yes' to the positive commandments and 'No' to the negative commandments. That is because the general categories of positive and negative encompass all the commandments.</p>\n\n<p>But the opinion of Rabbi Akiva is that they heard only the first statement directly, which includes all the others. They answered 'Yes' for the positive commandments and 'Yes' for the negative commandments. Here's a link: <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40606&st=&pgnum=88\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40606&st=&pgnum=88</a></p>\n\n<p>This view of Rabbi Akiva parallels the order set down in creation mentioned in Bereshit. The 10 statements at the giving of the Torah parallel the 10 utterances of the creation of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the language we say in Lecha Dodi, \"Shamor v'zachor b'dibbor echod\", (Negative and positive in one statement, G-d caused us to hear.), it seems the view of Rabbi Akiva is accepted.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, the commandment of 'You shall not murder' is a subset of the first commandment and would therefore not be 'the most important'.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting perspective is found in Sefer Avkat Rochel by Rabbeinu Makir ben Abba Mori, book one, chapter one, which says the Sages say the last of the ten, 'Lo tachmod', is the greatest and all the others are dependent upon it. It goes on to say that one who fulfills 'lo tachmod' is considered to have fulfilled the entire Torah. Here is a link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42999&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42999&st=&pgnum=3</a></p>\n\n<p>Here again, it is emphasizing the concept of all the others being contained within the one.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of Avkat Rochel, this appears to be emphasizing the kabbalistic concept of 'Ohr Yashar', emanation from above to below and 'Ohr Chozer', the return to the source from below to above. In either case, the point of origin contains all the particulars that follow it.</p>\n\n\n",

One student said maybe you issued a bad ruling, and the Rebbe said no I never issued a bad ruling. And then one student said maybe you didn't observe the laws of a widow once.

Clearly a widow can marry any man(unless kohen, or the son of the previous husband). Clearly once she's re-married you cannot marry her, she's now a married woman! So her status changes from widow to married. </p>\n\n<p>The closest I could come to an authority would be this claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The widow's <strong>right to maintenance also ceases if she remarries</strong>, because under the ketubbah, which is the source of her right, she is entitled to maintenance <strong>during widowhood only</strong>. According\n  to most of the authorities, she even loses her maintenance upon her\n  engagement for a new marriage – although by it alone she does not\n  create a new personal status – because by it she shows that <strong>she no\n  longer wishes to preserve the honor of her first husband and remain\n  his widow</strong> (Ket. 52b; 54a; Sh. Ar., EH 93:7 and Rema ad loc.).\n  <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_20884.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_20884.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So once she remarries she no longer has the right to maintenance or other rights provided by the previous marriage. It's logical to follow that an Almanah would no longer be granted the protection/status of a widow as she has given this up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it there an halachic opinion about whether or not it's ok for a person to take psychedelic mushrooms?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Assuming we're in portugal where drugs are decriminalized or in a Torah law society (So not taking into account Dina D'malchusa), what are the <em>halakhic</em> considerations regarding consuming psychedelic mushrooms? The reason I ask my question is because I saw <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10609/1713\">this question about smoking marijuana</a> and I believe that many of the factors that motivated Rav Moshe's <em>teshuva</em> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10611/1713\">cited in the answer</a> prohibiting marijuana are not relevant to mushrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Could they be permitted for <strong>medicinal purposes</strong>? Psychedelic mushrooms been used in many psychological treatments, as well as a known cure for cluster headaches.\nSee www.clusterbusters.org</p>\n\n<p>Could they be permitted for recreational use, considering the facts that they are <strong>non-addictive</strong> and <strong>nearly impossible to overdose on</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Mushrooms release chemicals in your brain, mainly serotonin. A typical trip lasts 4 hours. After the trip is done you can continue to take mushrooms but they have no effect as all of the available serotonin has been released. It takes 5-7 day to replenish your serotonin so you could only trip about once a week. You could take them every day if you wanted to but you would have no psychotropic effect from them until you gave it a rest for about a week. Most of this is anecdotal as the government has made this a schedule 1 drug. But if you search the web you'll find a zillion sites that state this. Most of them say only about once a month or twice a month works. But it's really about a week. Here's a site but there are many more.\n<a href=\"http://www.psychonaut.com/mushrooms/26445-waiting-period-between-2-trips.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.psychonaut.com/mushrooms/26445-waiting-period-between-2-trips.html</a></p>\n\n<p>After a certain amount the drug psilocybin which is the active ingredient doesn't do anything to you because you've released all of your serotonin. The mechanism is more complicated then what I'm describing but this should suffice. LD50 is the amount of a drug that is required to cause death. The LD50 of Psilocybin is about a pound, but that's the active ingredient and there's only a small amount of the drug in a mushroom. They estimate to achieve the LD50 you'd have to eat from 6 pounds to more than your bodyweight in mushrooms(depends on potency, but I'd bet it's a lot more than 6 pounds), which is impossible to do. Again there are many sites that discuss the LD50 of mushrooms. Here's one.\n<a href=\"http://www.psychonaut.com/mushrooms/26445-waiting-period-between-2-trips.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.psychonaut.com/mushrooms/26445-waiting-period-between-2-trips.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Also please don't respond that all intoxicants are not permissible, as alcohol is an intoxicant and is permissible to drink. It's even suggested to get drunk on holidays such as Purim and I've seen a few Rabbis shikered on Simchas Torah as well!</p>\n\n\n",

Considering that this is often/typically the case with, e.g., the popular toy Magna-Tiles, do any Rabbinic authorities discuss the permissibility/impermissibility of allowing children to use these types of building toys on Shabbat, where there is a high likelihood of their building such a structure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>THIS JUST IN</strong>: According to Orchos Shabbos chapter 9 siff 13, one must warn their chinuch aged child not to use building blocks such as Lego or the like to build a house or anything which has an Ohel of a tefach by a tefach if they are going to be using the space inside of it. And if they make this edifice it is not allowed to dismantle it.</p>\n<p>This is after having brought in chapter 8 siff 59 various opinions whether using Lego at all is allowed on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>For those who don't know, this seffer was written in partnership between Rabbis Shalom Yosef Gelber and Yitzchok Mordechai Rubin. They consider themselves to be  true students of Reb Elyashev and follow his path of psak. I am still standing behind my idea presented in the next section from my original answer, but be aware that some random guy on the internet thinks it's muttar and a well received, albeit usually stringent, seffer of practical halacha states it is not, so as always and especially now, <strong>CYLOR</strong></p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in the last siff of siman 315 rules stringently with opinion of the Rishonim who hold there is binyan with regards to keilim, vessels. Therefore he says when closing a barrel by stretching a cloth across it, one should leave some of the opening exposed. The Mishna Berurah there quotes other Rishonim who say there is no issue of binyan with keilim. Therefore he rules that even though we are stringent like the Shulchan Aruch, we do not have to reprimand people who are lenient, being that their actions are validated according to some opinions.\nThis would be a good reason to allow the children to continue building in this manner if one in fact held it is a problem of Ohel Arai/Binyan. Although concerning one's own children Chinuch would negate this argument, unless it is a situation where they would continue playing with it anyways. Than we would say Mutav lihyos shogagin (better to leave their mistake as unintentional).</p>\n<p><em>Reasons leaning to be stringent include the fact that the 'walls' of this ohel were built now, much like setting up the barrel to be covered, as opposed to placing the pot back on the kira (barrel like oven) whose walls (of the kira) were in place from beforehand. Also, in many situations the space underneath the 'roof' of this Ohel is used for keeping toys so as noted in M.B. #20 in that siman siff 3, there would be no allowance here of an ohel made indirectly.</em></p>\n<p>But I think there is a valid argument to say building this type of Ohel would be completely allowed.</p>\n<p>See the long Taz at the end of the siman #11, who after discussing the opinions concerning binyan by keilim, and ruling stringently like the Shulchan Aruch, makes an astounding observation. According to this stringent opinion, what is the allowance for people to place the lid of their large pot back upon the pot on Shabbos? After noting that nobody is stringent in this regard, he explains what he thinks is the true understanding about this law. Chazzal only prohibited placing a cover upon something else when the cover is not designated for use as a cover for that item, similar to the cloth used to cover the barrel. In that case alone does placing a non-covering iten on something else as a covering appear similar to as if one just 'created a roof'. That is why Chazzal prohibited it. However, a lid which is constantly used as a lid does not look similar to building a roof.</p>\n<p>I would say that Magna-Tiles fall under the category of being designated for use as covers, much like a pot lid.</p>\n<p>See in Rabbi Ribiat's 39 Melachos in the chapter on Boneh note 146a who quotes Kalkeles Shabbos that designating any lid for any pot before Shabbos would suffice for the Taz. Rabbi Ribiat adds that in his opinion any lid which is commonly used as a lid is considered designated.This is because we don't need real designation here, but rather we just need the item to be something used for covering as opposed to an article of clothing or such which is used for other things which is not comparable to Ohel.</p>\n<p>I bring this last source to prove both that this Taz is brought lihalacha, and to deflect any argument that any specific Magna-Tile was not designated for use as a 'roof'.</p>\n<p>(However, the lenient opinion here (the Rashba and raavad) talk about not having ohel by keilim, however the floor of the magna tile structure may indeed be the floor which may change the din (although one could argue against that). As for the Taz, the Biur Halacho rejects him, see that seif.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the answer at <a href=\"http://www.frumtoronto.com/Blogger.asp?BlogCategoryID=98&ShowEntryID=9313\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frumtoronto.com</a> Rabbi A Bartfeld quoting Rabbi Shlomo Miller compares it to Lego and says that it is permitted.</p>\n\n\n",

(I don't remember if this depended on other factors, like timing.)  And according to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/45002/472\">this answer</a> if you are in the middle of saying Shalom Rav when you should have said Sim Shalom you go back to the beginning of the b'racha, but if you only realized after you don't have to repeat.  So there is precedent for going back to the beginning and starting again.</p>\n\n<p>A kaddish isn't a b'racha.  Specifically, it doesn't include the divine name.  That might make a difference.  And the two kaddishes are the same for about the first half, unlike the Shalom Rav/Sim Shalom case.</p>\n\n<p>So if you realize your mistake while reciting the kaddish as in the situation I described, where you intended one and started to say another, do you go back to the beginning, or go back to the point of divergence (\"al yisrael\"), or just continue (changing it to Kaddish Yatom though that wasn't your intent)?

One example is in Shemiras Halashon, it says that if the groom-to-be is not fit, to tell the bride's father even if that means it will cancel the wedding. Or in the Torah, there are references to a father giving his daughter to his servent as a wife, or (though not a halachic decider) Leah was given to Yaakov first as per her father's desire.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, can a father prohibit his daughter from marrying somebody, or were those things simply non-halachick byproducts of cultural practices that we don't have anymore?</p>\n\n\n",

Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin) says that when the turkey (indik) was brought from India there were questions regarding its kosher status, and therefore some people refrained from eating it. However, since the majority of people accepted it as kosher, unless there is evidence that it is not kosher, we are not going to say that it is prohibited post facto (especially not to tell people who were eating it for many years that they were doing so in error). Also, perhaps Ramah only requires a mesorah on a bird that was not eaten by Jews in the past. However, a bird that was eaten for many years and has all three simanim of a kosher bird is permitted even according to Ramah. There is no reason to say that all the people who ate turkey did so in error.<br>\n  <strong>Arugas Habosem (pp. 16)</strong> says that the mesorah is only required to prove that it is not a doreis. If the bird is monitored for at least twelve months, one may rely on the kosher status of the bird even without having a mesorah on it, as it is obviously not a doreis.<br>\n  <strong>Kaf Hachaim (82:21)</strong> says that the mesorah originated from the Jews in India and is thus permitted. Similarly, Rabbi Moshe Heinemann (Star-K, Baltimore) feels that since it’s called oaf hodu, it came from Hodu (India), and the Jews there had a mesorah on it.<br>\n  <strong>Tzemach Tzedek (YD 60)</strong> says the fact that a specific bird is eaten is a form of mesorah.<br>\n  <strong>Shoel U’Meishiv (5:1:69)</strong> posits that turkey has all three simanim and is not a doreis, end of story. And what of the Ramah about needing a mesorah? There is no mesorah for a turkey, and it must be that klal yisrael did not fully accept this Ramah. In other words, we do not hold like Ramah’s opinion, and if a bird has the simanim which indicate a kosher status we may eat it even without a mesorah.<br>\n  <strong>Rabbi Hershel Schachter:</strong> Columbus was from Spain, and so when he returned from America back to Spain, he brought the turkeys back with him. Thus, the mesorah we have today comes from the Jews of Spain, who have a long and rich history. Or, Columbus discovered America 1492, some 48 years before Ramah was born (in 1540). Thus, it seems that a sound sevara would be that Jews began eating turkey based on its kosher simanim alone, without a requirement for mesorah, as Ramah didn’t write his opinion yet!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it seems that songbirds might have a messora,  </p>\n\n<p>From  <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/ou-companies-speak/the-birds-of-the-bible-or-solving-the-mystery-of-which-of-the-species-are-kosher-and-which-are-not/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://oukosher.org/blog/ou-companies-speak/the-birds-of-the-bible-or-solving-the-mystery-of-which-of-the-species-are-kosher-and-which-are-not/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p> There are other birds such as partridges and <strong>songbirds</strong> which have been consumed for thousands of years, their consumption originating in a time when people still recognized the forbidden birds listed in the bible</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PS Rabbi Chaim Loike from OU researches this subject </p>\n\n<p>PPS maybe there source of Rabbi Heinamann's opinion is from this video Chickenar (11/12/2012) by 9:38</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Contemporary leniencies regarding the prohibition(s) of new grain",
    "content": "# Contemporary leniencies regarding the prohibition(s) of new grain\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since Talmudic times, Rabbinic scholars have grappled with the apparent contradiction between the Biblical and/or Rabbinic prohibition(s) of <em>chodosh</em> (new grain grown since Passover) and the common Ashkenazic practice in the Diaspora to ignore the issue. The Talmud (Menachot) records that there was a dispute between Tannaitic and Amoraic scholars regarding whether <em>chodosh</em> outside Israel is forbidden biblically or Rabbinically. The overwhelming majority of the most prominent post-Talmudic authorities ruled that the prohibition is biblical in nature even outside Israel (e.g. Maimonides, Rif, Rosh, Shulchan Aruch, Ram\"a, Ba\"ch, Gr\"a, Sha\"ch, Ta\"z) which means that even an equiprobable uncertainty (<em>safek hashakul</em>) would be completely forbidden. (Further, following the Maharshal, Rav Moshe Feinstein doesn't even allow relying on a majority to be lenient.) Nonetheless, the common practice continues to be one of leniency.</p>\n\n<p>In Europe, one justification of the practice was suggested by the Ba\"ch who argued with both those who preceded and those who followed him and claimed the prohibition only applied to Jewish-owned grain. This approach appears to be the one adopted by the Hassidic community following a story in which the Baal Shem Tov was temporarily lenient because of the Bach allegedly appearing to him in a dream.* Nonetheless, this leniency is widespread in even the Mithnagdic community that generally would follow the Rama (who follows the Ro\"sh and maintains it's a biblical prohibition regardless of ownership). </p>\n\n<p>This leniency of the Bach is almost universally rejected, including by his son-in-law, the Taz, who instead suggests that <em>b'shaat hadechak</em> (in time of pressing need), there is room to be reliant on the minority Tanaitic position that the prohibition is only Rabbinic, thus allowing leniency in cases of <em>safek hashakul</em>.**  The Shach rejects this leniency as well since the Talmudic dictum upon which the Taz is based \"<em>kdai hu Rabbi Eliezer lismoch alav bshaas hadechak</em> (\"Fitting is Rabbi Eliezer to rely upon him in time of duress\") never appears where the majority position was that the prohibition is biblical in nature. The Taz is however relied upon by Rav Nachum Rabinovitch, <em>shlitah</em>, in his responsa sefer <em>Siach Nachum</em>. Nonetheless, it seems fairly self-evident that even the Taz would be strict in a city where <em>yoshon</em> (grain that rooted before Passover) alternatives are cheaply and readily available, such as in New York and its suburbs. </p>\n\n<p>Another leniency is suggested by the Aruch HaShulchan to be used in combination with other leniencies, based on the recently unearthed rulings of the Ohr Zarua. He justified the already common practice by suggesting two stacked <em>chiddushim</em>: 1. that the lenient communities traditionally followed the minority Tannaitic position, and 2. that that position only forbade (even Rabbinically) <em>chodosh</em> in lands near Israel. (Presumably, this distance included Jewish Iraq/Bavel since even the Amoraim who were lenient there with regard to biblical law, kept the Rabbinic prohibition.) My understanding is that this position is what is relied upon by Rav Herschel Schachter, <em>shlitah</em>, and (more recently) by Rav Mordechai Willig, <em>shlitah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(Well that was a mouthful...) </p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To my understanding (please correct me if I am wrong), the O-U uses a majority rule of their 3 poskim, <em>shlitah</em>: Rav Schechter, Rav Yisrael Belsky, and Rav Menachem Genack. Rav Belsky and Rav Genack are themselves <em>machmir</em> (strict). </p>\n\n<p>So what is the reasoning behind the O-U's certification as kosher of products that are possibly/probably/definitely <em>chodosh</em> (particularly considering their stringent positions even beyond the letter of the law with regard to certifying other issues - e.g. relying on <em>rov</em>-majority)? </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, do Rav Schechter and Rav Willig reject the majority position of the mainstream Rishonim and Achronim, even in places and/or for persons for whom it is not a <em>shaat hadechak</em>? What is the basis for rejecting the majority and mainstream positions based on an at best speculative retrospective claim that the communities' authorities were lenient? Considering we no longer (and perhaps never) lived in the communities of the minority/non-existent lenient position, why would we not now follow the majority? </p>\n\n<p>Further, inasmuch as these practices were used in a post-hoc, <em>minhag</em>-justifying, <em>shaat hadechak</em> manner in a climate where the masses were unlikely to have heeded a stringent ruling (see e.g. Rama citing Rosh), what justification is there to be lenient nowadays for those who are strict for even more tedious and more minor stringencies?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, is there any other argument used by kashrut agencies to justify their certification of <em>chodosh</em>, when they are strict on other seemingly far more minor issues? </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*(I'm not sure how this reliance shouldn't be a violation of the Midrashic interpretation of \"<em>lo bashamayim hi</em>;)</p>\n\n<p>**The Gr\"a also uses unusually harsh language in rejecting his great-great-great-grandfather the Be'er HaGolah's lenient position, arguing that it would have been if he had never written it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>To start, you may want to address that question to the O-U directly, as third entities would be largely speculative.</p>\n\n<p>My speculation, though, is that it would be too difficult, even today, to certify food for the masses of Americans and all the food products by Yashan standards. The reason is that in many places, varying by the season, Yashan grain would be hard to come by for the whole year. This becomes increasingly difficult as Chadash grain will become permitted at some future time (after Passover) and therefore cannot be batel b'shishim. This extreme degree of care may be too much for many food producers. Even foods without grain ingredients would be at risk of cross-contamination. So while some foods do come marked as Yashan, it's too much to demand it for a basic O-U.</p>\n\n<p>I would also suggest that culturally, different people and generations have different priorities, even though it is not halachically permitted to do so. For a long time, nobody cared about shaatnez. Today, many don't care about Yashan. Whether or not that is okay, it happens, and for many it would be too restrictive to even entertain a logical consideration of the actual halacha.</p>\n\n<p>That said, many people are starting to avoid Chadash grain. And there are resources to find out when food was produced and what time of the year Chadash grains would have likely entered the food. For example, a few months after Passover, Chadash grain may be used for flower, so some check expiration dates on boxes to make sure it wasn't produced after mid-summer or so. Of course that is just besides the point.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is one allowed to have his child take a non-kosher oral vaccine if the law requires it to attend school?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many state laws require that toddlers be vaccinated prior to attending elementary school.</p>\n\n<p>Years ago, the Sabin Polio oral vaccine was used. I'm uncertain if oral vaccines are used, now. Let's say that an oral vaccine for some illness has non-kosher ingredients. There is no other form of the same vaccine (i.e. no dermal form.) Let's also assume that not taking the vaccine is not life-threatening, but, state or local law requires a child to take this vaccine otherwise he cannot attend yeshiva, or any school.</p>\n\n<p>Would this circumstance allow a child to take this vaccine? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Even when the circumstances are not life-threatening (neither for the choleh nor for others), but the medication/immunization would prevent illness (<em>choli she'eyn bo sakana</em>), non-kosher medication may be taken if there are no kosher alternatives, provided that it is <em>shelo k'derech achila</em> (not in the manner of eating; e.g. swallowing pills). </p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/medicine/452/a-kashrus-guide-to-medications-vitamins-and-nutritional-supplements/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star-K</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a person is healthy or has a slight discomfort and his physician advises that there is a high risk of him becoming a <em>choleh sheyaish bo sakana</em> or even a <em>choleh she’ain bo sakana</em>, this person may take non-kosher supplements <em>shelo k’derech achila</em>, in an uncommon manner. For example, if a doctor advises HRT9 to a middle-aged woman to avoid osteoporosis, a common condition in older women, she may swallow a non-kosher capsule or tablet if an equally effective kosher substitute is unavailable. Similarly, if a doctor advises swallowing a specially formulated non-kosher vitamin for someone who has a high risk of developing macular degeneration (a disease in the central part of the retina that leads to blindness), one is permitted to swallow the product. However, if a healthy individual wishes to take non-kosher supplements to prevent an illness which is unlikely to occur, a Rav should be consulted, since the halacha is similar to one who has a <em>maychush</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you are asking where there is an oppressive government that demands eating e.g. pork as a vaccine to a minor discomfort (<em>maychush</em>), if their intention is not specifically to challenge Jewish law (such that we would invoke the rules of <em>shmad</em>), we would presumably allow the consumption of non-kosher to avoid children being prevented from learning Torah. This can be inferred from the fact that historically many Rabbis have risked their lives to teach and learn Torah, combined with the fact that one is not allowed to give up one's life to avoid eating non-Kosher (assuming the intent was not religious coercion; i.e. Torah>life>kosher). </p>\n\n<p>Edit: On second thought, that only proves one could <em>risk</em> eating non-kosher in order to learn/teach Torah...</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, the Pri Chadash (cited in Pitchei Teshuva 240:8) infers from this rule that one can study far from his parents even though this will prevent his being available to honor them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Gemara says the following in Megillah 16b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יוסף: גדול תלמוד תורה יותר מהצלת נפשות. דמעיקרא חשיב ליה למרדכי בתר ארבעה ולבסוף בתר חמשה. מעיקרא כתיב אשר באו עם זרבבל ישוע נחמיה שריה רעליה מרדכי בלשן, ולבסוף כתיב הבאים עם זרבבל ישוע נחמיה עזריה רעמיה נחמני מרדכי בלשן. אמר רב ואיתימא רב שמואל בר מרתא: גדול תלמוד תורה יותר מבנין בית המקדש, שכל זמן שברוך בן נריה קיים - לא הניחו עזרא ועלה. אמר רבה אמר רב יצחק בר שמואל בר מרתא: גדול תלמוד תורה יותר מכבוד אב ואם, שכל אותן שנים שהיה יעקב אבינו בבית עבר לא נענש.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize: Rav Yosef said: Torah study is greater than saving lives. Rav said, and some say this was said by Rav Shmuel bar Marta: Torah study is greater than the rebuilding of the Temple. Rav Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marta said: Torah study is greater than honoring one’s parents, for Jacob was not punished for his time spent studying Torah away from home.</p>\n<p>We may ask what the Gemara is trying to teach us about Torah study and these other mitzvos. Is it telling us that if one can only perform one or the other that Torah study takes precedence? Or is it telling us which mitzvah is greater (reflected perhaps by greater reward for its performance)?</p>\n<p>The Tur rules that one prioritizes saving lives over Torah study (YD: 251).</p>\n<p>The Maharshal (cited in Bach there), however, disagrees with the Tur, understanding that one actually ought to choose Torah study over these other mitzvos (he is referring specifically to saving lives)!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב מהרש\"ל (בהגהותיו לטור) ע\"ז ותימה הלא אסיקנא בסוף פ\"ק דמגילה (טז ב) גדול תלמוד תורה יותר מהצלת נפשות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Maharshal’s student; the Prisha (thereon: 13) argues with his mentor and defends the Tur, writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונלע\"ד דהתם מיירי שיש אחרים שיכולים להציל הנפשות ולכן אף על פי שהוא מצוה גדולה מי שמקדים להציל נפשות מ\"מ תלמוד תורה קודם הואיל שיש אחרים שיכולין להציל הנפשות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, Torah study only takes precedence if someone else will save the life. If there is no one available to save the life, however, then one must stop learning to save the life.</p>\n<p>The Bach, too, disagrees with Maharshal, writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא קשה מידי דהתם לא קאמר אלא דגדול הוא העוסק בתורה להחשיבו ולהקדימו יותר ממי שעוסק בהצלת נפשות דאינו חשוב כמו העוסק בתלמוד תורה אבל להוציא ממון להצלת נפשות פשיטא הוא דקודם להוצאה לתלמוד תורה דאין לך דבר שעומד בפני פיקוח נפש דוחי בהם ולא שימות בהם (יומא פה ב) ופשוט הוא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the Maharshal’s question is not difficult at all, since in saying that Torah study is greater than saving lives, the Gemara never intended to suggest that Toarh study supersedes saving lives; rather, that it has a greater relative merit. And it is obvious that one must save a life rather than study Torah. This is clear from the fact nothing takes precedence over saving lives, and he concludes that this is all obvious.</p>\n<p>The Taz (to Shulchan Aruch there: 6) also disagrees with the Maharshal sharply, siding with the Tur, Prisha and Bach, and writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין כאן קושיא דודאי אין לך דבר עומד בפני פיקוח נפש אלא דהתם אומר דיותר יש זכות למי שזוכה לעסוק בתורה ולא בא לידו הצלת נפשות ממי שבא לידו הצלת נפשות ועל ידי כך צריך לבטל תלמוד תורה ולעסוק בהצלת נפש... ויותר תימה על בעל הדרישה שכתב בתירוץ קושיא זאת דאם הוא בענין שאין יכול לקיים שניהם אז תלמוד תורה קודם כו' וזה ודאי אינו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He reiterates that the intent of the Gemara is not that Torah ought to supersede saving lives, but rather, that one is luckier if he merits to study Torah, than to save lives. He concludes that the Maharshal was certainly mistaken. Furthermore, the Taz compares the different mitzvos that the Gemara there lumps together as being inferior to Torah study.</p>\n<p>The Ohr Hachayim, in Rishon Letziyon to that passage in Megillah, also disagrees with the Maharshal, and sides with the Tur. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שם גדול ת\"ת יותר מהצלת נפשות וכו' פירו' דוקא כה\"ג שעומד בפרץ לבל יבוא הדבר לידי סכנת נפשות אבל להציל מן הים ומן המפולת דקיימי נפשות להציל אין לך דבר שקול כפיקוח נפשות גם מאי דקאמר גדול ת\"ת מבנין בהמ\"ק מיירי דלא מתבטל בנינו מחמתיה אבל זולת זה בנין בהמ\"ק עדיף...אבל בזמן הצלתן של ישראל פשיטא דעדיף ועדיף מת\"ת ולא מבעיא דרבים אלא אפי' הצלת נפש דיחיד עדיף מת\"ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, it is obvious that the intent of the Gemara was not that one should not save a life, rather that if one can do both that studying Torah has the greater merit. The Ohr Hachayim too lumps together the different mitzvos mentioned in that passage (he mentions construction of the Temple) and writes that it is obvious that if someone else will not build it that a person must cease learning to do so.</p>\n<p>He emphasized this same point in Rishon Letziyon (to YD 251: 14) once again emphasizing that this is obvious:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל לפיקוח נפש דהיינו אם רואה נפש הולכת לאיבוד פשיטא דמבטלין ת\"ת עליה דאפילו שבת מחללין ביטול ת\"ת דלא הוי אלא עשה מיבעיא ופשוט:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam does not quote this Gemara in Megillah (AFAIK) which implies that it is not halachic. This would seems to align him with the Tur, et al. rather than the Maharshal. Indeed Rambam <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1303.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Hil. Talmud Torah 3:3)</a>  states unequivocally that every mitzvah takes precedence over Torah study.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה לפניו עשיית מצוה ותלמוד תורה--אם אפשר למצוה להיעשות על ידי אחרים, לא יפסיק תלמודו; ואם לאו, יעשה המצוה ויחזור לתורתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is based on the Yerushalmi Pesachim (ch. 3).</p>\n<p>See also Rabbi Yerocham Fischel Perlow (commentary to Rav Saadya Gaon's Sefer HaMitzvos (Assei: 9-10) who writes that at least some kibbud av v'em supersedes Torah study:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתחייב לבטל מת\"ת ולעסוק במצות אביו ואמו משום עשה דמורא דעדיפא מת\"ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Terumas Hadeshen (40) references the Gemara in Megillah in a halachic context, which is in accordance of the minority view of the Maharshal, and apparently against the Rambam, Tur, Bach, Perisha, and Taz's reading of the Gemara in Megillah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Interestingly, a careful reading of Rashi's commentary (Genesis 28:9), (at least according to one text) suggests that Jacob shouldn’t have studied but rather served his parents. Nevertheless, the great merit of the Torah protected him from punishment for this misdeed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובשביל זכות התורה לא נענש עליהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This issue has been <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35926/halacha-of-married-women-covering-their-hair\">discussed</a> already on this forum. Rav <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Henkin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yehuda Herzl-Henkin</a> has wonderful and thorough treatment of the subject in Bnei Banim, also available in English <a href=\"http://freepdfhosting.com/3637dbd864.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Obviously the topic is very broad, I merely bring these points up as a preface to my question. </p>\nThe question being, it seems that much of the issues of uncovered hair are centered on Ervah, or at least on the notion of hair being meant to be covered. So if a woman doesn't have hair, it would seem that there is no need for her to cover her scalp. Is there any requirement for a bald woman to wear a kerchief on her head, or perhaps does having a bald head itself fulfill the requirement? (In the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%97\" rel=\"noreferrer\">verse</a> from which we learn the concept of hair-covering, it uses the word ראש/her head, rather than שער/her hair -- perhaps this is pertinent to the answer.) </p> An adjunct to this question would be: if indeed a scalp-cover is not required, why do the many Chasidic women who shave their heads continue to wear a head cover? Is there a Halachic opinion that requires this, or is that a separate issue?

The leader goes before the ark [to recite\n  the Prayer on Friday eve] and he recites the [special Sabbath]\n  blessing which embodies an abstract of the seven [intermediate\n  blessings of the daily Prayer of Eighteen] and he concludes it by\n  saying, ‘Blessed art thou O Lord, who sanctifies Israel and the\n  Sabbath Day.’” [Through this recitation, they fulfill their obligation\n  to recite the Prayer of Sanctification.]</p>\n  \n  <p>(translation from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Neusner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Neusner</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this source, it seems that the recitation of the <em>beracha me'ein sheva</em> is there so that those who don't have wine and also cannot pray <em>ma'ariv</em> themselves can fulfill their obligation of <em>kiddush hayom</em> via the <em>shaliach tsibbur</em>.

Here is a great link to a brochure on tefillin use from Rav Shimon Eider of Lakewood. He discusses borrowed tefillin on page 43.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=NngGLyMML0wC&pg=PR4&lpg=PR4&dq=stolen+tefillin&source=bl&ots=mmalV00q0t&sig=uANLwZ4YR1jZvDIUSMDx_Drl1xw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiumMiitqDKAhUDaD4KHTFuDg4Q6AEIJDAD#v=onepage&q=stolen%20tefillin&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://books.google.com/books?id=NngGLyMML0wC&pg=PR4&lpg=PR4&dq=stolen+tefillin&source=bl&ots=mmalV00q0t&sig=uANLwZ4YR1jZvDIUSMDx_Drl1xw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiumMiitqDKAhUDaD4KHTFuDg4Q6AEIJDAD#v=onepage&q=stolen%20tefillin&f=false</a></p>\n\n<p>It's possible to look at the discussion in Aruch HaShulchan, Orach Chaim, vol. 1, 14:11-14 and conclude that if one is 'unkempt' or 'unclean' that they would be required to ask permission from the owner of a tallit left in a shul. But this is not understanding the language used by the author.</p>\n\n<p>When considering a talit or tefillin left in the shul, it excludes those that have been 'hidden away', meaning where the intention of the owner is communicated through their action of 'hiding' the item. This means that the item is not left in the public domain. Using such a talit or tefillin crosses into the domain of theft.</p>\n\n<p>The other emphasis is that when the item is left in the public domain, the borrower must, as best as possible, return it in the condition that they borrowed it. If found folded then replace it folded, etc. The emphasis is about not causing any loss to the one from whom you borrowed the item.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan then mentions the subject of those who are \"Makpied\". He quotes the Tur which says that if you know someone is 'kapied', meaning an owner who is a 'kapdan', this leniency to allow borrowing is not permissible even if their talit is left in the public domain of the shul. It isn't about being clean or free of skin conditions.</p>\n\n<p>To apply that limitation it is necessary to understand what a 'kapdan' is according to its usage in Torah. That is found in Avot 2:5 quoting Rabbi Hillel, \"וְלֹא הַבַּיְשָׁן לָמֵד, וְלֹא הַקַּפְּדָן מְלַמֵּד.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9F_%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%93_%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%93%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/לא_הבישן_למד_ולא_הקפדן_מלמד</a></p>\n\n<p>Kapdanut is an exceedingly bad character trait which is indicated by an extreme intolerance of others. In general, this type of person is one to be avoided. A discussion of this subject can be found at this link:\n<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/chazal/avot.asp?perek=2&mishna=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daat.ac.il/chazal/avot.asp?perek=2&mishna=5</a></p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan comments that around him, he observes many people with this character trait and to be careful about it. But again, even with the 'kapdan', it is emphasizing the idea of creating loss to them, real or imaginary. This is the same emphasis he quotes from the Semak and the Mordechai and the Nimukei Yosef. The Aruch HaShulchan enumerates especially 'kapdanim' with a new talit being concerned over perspiration and cleanliness. The emphasis is not on the fact that the borrower perspires. All human beings perspire. The emphasis is on the intolerance of the owner, the kapdanut.</p>\n\n<p>The second term the Aruch HsShulchan uses here is 'nakiyut', which means cleanliness. It is possible, especially from his time period that he could have been including the concept of cleanliness as it relates to health. We have an obligation to protect the body, 'Shemirat HaGuf' from physical harm. Some maladies are transmittable via contact, like for example poison ivy or poison sumac. The oils that cause the irritation can be transferred through contact. So a person with such a condition could transfer the condition to another via the tefillin for example. So too, a person with lice could transfer the lice via a talit or tefillin. A person with such a condition should not borrow a talit or tefillin without the express permission of the owner.</p>\n\n<p>But in the case of eczema, this skin condition is not contagious, even during extreme flare ups. So that concern would not apply. See the attached link.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/atopic-dermatitis-eczema</a></p>\n\n<p>And to put this personality trait of 'kapdanut' into proper perspective it's worth looking at what appears in tractate Derech Eretz Rabbah, chapter 3.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/derecheretzrabba3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/derecheretzrabba3.html</a></p>\n\n<p>One who loves his neighbors and is friendly to his relatives, and one who marries off his sister's daughter, and one who loans even a small amount to a poor man in his need, of them the Torah says (Isaiah 58:9) \"Then shalt you call, and the L-rd will answer...\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (10:22) states that you are permitted to borrow someone else's tefillin without their knowledge and say a bracha on them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מֻתָּר לִקַּח תְּפִלִּין שֶׁל חֲבֵרוֹ גַּם שֶׁלֹּא בִידִיעָתוֹ לְהָנִיחָן וּלְבָרֵךְ עֲלֵיהֶן, כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתַבְתִּי בְּסִימָן שֶׁלִּפְנֵי זֶה סָעִיף י\"א לְעִנְיַן טַלִּית</p>\n<p>It is permitted for one to take his friend's tefillin even without his permission, to put them on and recite a blessing over them, like which I wrote in the chapter before concerning the tallit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kitzur relates this halacha with that of borrow someone's tallit, as brought in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67128/11486\">DanF's answer</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

The ideas presented in the work are of a more mystical nature than standard halacha. However the ideas are most definitely referenced in later halachic works. </p>\n\n<p>The section this quote is coming from is referred to as the Tzavaos, the instructions. This section presents an interesting dichotomy in being more often quoted (perhaps due to it's smaller size or seemingly imperative section name) but at the same time more easily absolved of the need to adhere to this section with the understanding that these instructions were meant for his descendants alone and no-one else. </p>\n\n<p>This last idea was presented by the Noda BiYehuda and quoted often by subsequent authorities. But many times Rabbis only use this as an allowance for something they would have rather avoided. For instance, concerning some of the Tzavaos which people seem to care about such as not marrying a spouse with the same name as a parent, or making two marriages on the same day. Some of these ideas have been accepted as 'minhag' some have not and some have been allowed when there is a need. \nAnd of course as @Fred pointed out, there are many Tzavaos which are completely ignored.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, another famous idea from Rabbi Yehuda Hachassid is to not cut one's hair on Rosh Chodesh. This had been brought in the Magen Avraham and Mishna Berurah to keep. But there is a tradition in the Chafetz Chaim's family that he never meant to be stringent when Rosh Chodesh is on Friday which would cause one to enter Shabbos disheveled. Rabbi Yaakov Kaminetzky also had an inference from the Magen Avraham himself that he thought it was nice to take this idea into consideration, but ultimately in a situation of need, like Erev Shabbos, one does not need to worry about it.</p>\n\n<p>This is the approach taken by Rabbi Margolios in that note in the name of various Rabbis starting with the Noda BiYehuda. He quotes the Gemara in Brachos 44a where we find 80 pairs of siblings married off to each other, seemingly a proof against this Seffer Chassidim, but he concludes that since we find their unfortunate demise in Yoma 38b, we cannot use this as proof to defend an allowance. He quotes as well from that gemara where we find the daughters of Rav Chisda marrying the brothers Rami bar Chama and Mar Ukva bar Chama, which again would seemingly imply the complete allowance of such unions. He deflects this though by pointing out that the gemara went out of its way to point out how great they were, something he claims is superfluous unless the gemara was attempting to give a good reason why these brothers were allowed to marry these sisters. He also adds on that even after finding a good reason why to allow this marriage, the end result was not a happy one as we find Rami bar Chama dying young in Bava Basra 12b where Rava marries his widow.</p>\n\n<p>The note in my edition quotes more Tshuva Sefarim who discuss this, but does not go into details.</p>\n\n<p>Practically speaking, this is seemingly not something people are stringent about. In another note there Rabbi Margolios quotes The Seffer Tzemach Tzedek on Yoreh Deah saying he married two of his children to siblings. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Yes they are allowed to marry.

Along with this, I would suggest that the latter halachot you link (regarding charity) suggest the intent of the former (regarding marital obligations):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵין פּוֹחֲתִין לְעָנִי הָעוֹבֵר מִמָּקוֹם לְמָקוֹם, מִכִּכָּר\nבְּפּוּנְדְּיוֹן (הָרַמְבַּ''ם פֵּרֵשׁ שֶׁמִּשְׁקָל הַפּוּנְדְּיוֹן\nהוּא ח' גַּרְעִינֵי שְׂעוֹרָה). מִד' סְאִין בְּסֶלַע. וְאִם לָן,\nנוֹתְנִין לוֹ מַצָּע לִישַׁן עָלָיו וְכֶסֶת לִתֵּן מְרַאֲשׁוֹתָיו\nוְשֶׁמֶן וְקִטְנִיּוֹת. וְאִם שָׁבַת, נוֹתְנִין לוֹ מְזוֹן ג'\nסְעֻדּוֹת וְשֶׁמֶן וְקִטְנִית וְדָג וְיָרָק. וְאִם מַכִּירִין אוֹתוֹ,\nנוֹתְנִין לוֹ לְפִי כְּבוֹדוֹ.</p>\n<p>We give no less to a passing poor man than a loaf weighing a\n<em>pundyon</em>... But if we recognize him, we give him according to his honor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The sense is that the ironclad rules (of a pundyon loaf, mattress, oil, etc.) are for where we have no subjective information about what the person is actually accustomed to. If, however, we know the person and what they were accustomed to be fore they fell into hard times, we try to accomodate them based on what we know. Thus the famous gemara (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.67b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kethubot 67b</a>) upon which the Shulchan Aruch's halacha is based:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנו רבנן: \"די מחסורו\" - אתה מצווה עליו לפרנסו ואי אתה מצווה עליו לעשרו; \"אשר יחסר לו\" - אפילו סוס לרכוב עליו ועבד לרוץ לפניו. אמרו עליו על הלל הזקן שלקח לעני בן טובים אחד סוס לרכוב עליו ועבד לרוץ לפניו. פעם אחת לא מצא עבד לרוץ לפניו ורץ לפניו שלשה מילין</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: \"...sufficient for his lacking\" (Deuteronomy 15:8) - You are commanded regarding him to provide for him, not to enrich him. \"in that which he lacks\" - even a horse to ride upon and a bondsman to run before him. They said about Hillel the Elder that he took for one poor man from a wealthy family a horse to ride upon and a bondsman to run before him. Once, he did not find a bondsman to run before him, so he himself ran before him for three <em>mil</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, with regard to a man's obligations to honoring his wife, since he presumably knows both his and her social standing, there is no ironclad rule that is applicable. If her socioeconomic status before the marriage was greater than his and she was used to finer things, that's what he would be obligated to provide. Likewise, if his status is socioeconomically greater, he has to provide her with what he is used to, even though she was used to less.</p>\n<p>This is also the sense in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.89.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 89:1</a> that you link:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מֵתָה הָאִשָּׁה בְּחַיֵּי הַבַּעַל, חַיָּב לְקָבְרָהּ וְלִטַּפֵּל בְּכָל צָרְכֵי קְבוּרָתָהּ, וּבִכְלַל זֶה הָאֶבֶן שֶׁנּוֹתְנִים עַל הַקֶּבֶר. וְכֵן חַיָּב לַעֲשׂוֹת לָהּ מִסְפֵּד וְקִינִים, כְּדֶרֶךְ כָּל הַמְּדִינָה. וְאִם דַּרְכָּם לְהַסְפִּיד בַּחֲלִילִין, לֹא יִפְחֹת מִשְּׁנֵי חֲלִילִין וּמְקוֹנְנוֹת, אֲפִלּוּ עָנִי שֶׁבְּיִשְׂרָאֵל; וְאִם הָיָה עָשִׁיר, הַכֹּל לְפִי כְּבוֹדוֹ. וְאִם הָיָה כְּבוֹדָהּ יוֹתֵר מִכְּבוֹדוֹ, קוֹבְרִים אוֹתָהּ לְפִי כְּבוֹדָהּ, שֶׁעוֹלָה עִמּוֹ וְאֵינָהּ יוֹרֶדֶת:</p>\n<p>If the wife died during the husbands life, he is obligated to bury her...

And if her hinor is greater than his, she is buried according to her honor, for she upgrades with him, but does not downgrade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While their might be an ironclad minimum for even the poorest of the poor, once he/she transcends that, the eligibility is subjective and evaluated case-by-case using the norms of the country, era, and social standing.</p>\n\n\n",

That being said, is it better to have cotton strings on a cotton garment or Wool/linen? </p>\n\n<p>Note: This is ignoring the later halacha in the Shulchan Aruch where the MeChaber cautions against using linen tzitzis strings/Garments.

This status lasts for two weeks, because we don't know if the fetus is a male or a female and we must take into account that if it is a female, the \"impurity\" is two weeks, as opposed to the one week of impurity for a male.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we would know that the fetus is a male, then the impurity would only be one week.</p>\n\n<p>If an ultrasound was performed, and the gender of the child was determined to be male, could this be relied upon to limit the \"impurity\" to one week?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein, z\"l, rules (<em>Igroth Moshe</em> YD 3:52) that a pregnancy test (\"בדיקות הידועות לרופאים\") can be relied upon to assume halachically that a woman is pregnant (with regard to whether she would need to continue to keep <em>w'sathoth</em>).

Since they hold that tefilloh is day-sensitive and not sunrise-sunset–sensitive, it follows that someone who davens and then crosses the dateline westward (leading into the following day) has to daven again even though he did not experience a sunset or second sunrise. If it is the day that requires the tefilloh, then since he is now in a new day, he must fulfill that day’s tefilloh obligation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Elyashiv is reported to hold the opposite opinion and to consider\n  tefilloh to be sunrise-sunset–sensitive.

See e.g. <a href=\"http://www.thehalachacenter.org/at_a_glance/5772_shemos.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Yitzchok Grossman</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The topic of Mesirah in the modern era is a very fraught area of Halachah. On the one hand, Shas and Poskim have traditionally condemned Mosrim in the most drastic terms: they are included (along with apikorsim and those who have sinned and caused others to sin) in the list of those who suffer for an extended duration in Hell,1 are worse than apostates,2 and cannot (at least according to some opinions) ritually slaughter animals,3 or write Sifre Torah4 or Gittin.5 And, of course, they may be killed “anywhere, even in contemporary times” after being duly warned, if they are threatening to inform. But on the other hand, it is clear that much of the Halachic literature on the topic was written in the context of regimes that were vastly more ruthless, brutal and unprincipled than modern Western democracies, and of Jewish communities that had much more autonomy and capability of internal regulation than today's post-Enlightenment diffuse and acculturated ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2007/rsch_mesirah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Herschel Schachter, shlita</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the non-Jewish governmental authorities know that one Jew is\n  concealing information about another Jew in order to save him from\n  punishment, the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 28:3) considers this a\n  situation of chilul Hashem. Similarly, for many generations it was the\n  practice that if a gneiva had occurred, and suspicion had fallen on\n  the Jewish community, rather than allow that suspicion to hover over\n  the entire community, the roshei hakehol, with the permission of the\n  rabbonim, would inform the non-Jewish authorities who might possibly\n  be the real ganav (Be'er Hagola, Choshen Mishpat 388:12).</p>\n  \n  <p>Even if one is guilty of a crime and deserves a punishment according\n  to the laws of the land, but due to anti-semetic attitudes he will\n  probably suffer more than if he were a non-Jew; or, the (state) prison\n  conditions are such that he will suffer at the hands of the other\n  inmates (or at the hands of the guards) in a manner that is not\n  proscribed by law, then turning the offender in would constitute\n  mesirah, since his added suffering will be shelo kadin. However,\n  mesirah is permitted in situations where one is a public menace (see\n  Shach to Choshen Mishpat 388, 59), or if one is physically or\n  psychologically harming another individual (for example, in instances\n  of sexual abuse of children, students, campers etc., or spousal abuse)\n  (see Shach to Choshen Mishpat ibid, 45).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Jewish community does not have the ability to investigate these\n  types of cases. Wherever there are raglayim ladavar that there seems\n  to be a problem, the proper government agencies should be contacted to\n  investigate.</p>\n  \n  <p>Just as in other areas of halachah, one should consult a competent\n  moreh horaah when faced with such a shayla. Just because one is\n  knowledgeable in Yoreh Deah vol. I or one delivers a good pilpul shiur\n  on sugyos in Nashim or Nezikin, it does not necessarily follow that\n  that individual will be qualified to pasken on hilchos mesirah -\n  lehakel or lehachmir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That said, giving an innocent person over to a ruthless, corrupt, and brutal authority (such as the pagan governments that existed at the time of the Talmud) would confer upon the culprit the status of a <em>rodef</em>, murderous pursuer where we save the victim by any means necessary, including with the life of the pursuer (see e.g. Bava Kama 117a and Teshuvoth HaRosh 17:1). </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the halacha is that killing a <em>rodef</em> when a less violent means could have accomplished the same end (e.g. <em>yachol l'hatzilo b'echad me'eivarav</em> \"he could have saved him by [injuring] one of the [pursuer's] limbs\") constitutes full murder. The equation then of a <em>moser</em> to a <em>rodef</em> suggests that if indeed a <em>moser</em> could be stopped with just a <em>cherem</em> (ostracization), violence would be prohibited by halacha.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/mesiralaw2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">JLaw's article on the topic</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>1     Rosh Ha'Shanah 17a, and see Shach CM 388:53.</p>\n\n<p>2     Shach ibid. and #62.</p>\n\n<p>3     Shach ibid., citing Shulchan Aruch YD 2:9.</p>\n\n<p>4     Shach ibid., citing Shulchan Aruch YD 281:3.</p>\n\n<p>5     Even Ha'Ezer Siman 123: Get Pashut #7 s.v. le'inyan mumar u'malshin, and Yeshuos Ya'akov (short) #9, cited in Pis'chei Teshuvah #4.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.388\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan aruch choshen mishpat 388</a> is about these laws</p>\n\n<p><strong>If he gave over money</strong>: he needs to repay.<br>\n<strong>if he gave over money or people</strong> he does not have a part in the world to come\n<strong>If he gave over 3 times money or people</strong>: we try to kill him passively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If he will do it:</strong> we can use any means to stop him even to kill him (is a mitszva, first one to come gets to do it) even in our times (shulchan aruch said this) (but not after he did it, if he is not going to do it again)</p>\n\n<p>(There are exception when it is permitted to give over a Jew).<br>\n(If you want a sposific law translation/details ask for it in the comments).<br>\nIt seems that a Bais din can put him in chairem </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do many non-Orthodox Jews come to shul regularly only after a parent's death?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I attend a Conservative / traditional shul. Primarily because of neighborhood demographics (the neighborhood is now largely Orthodox), we have tremendous problems forming a daily minyan. It seems that on weekdays, the main reason a person will regularly attend minyan is if he is mourning or has yahrtzeit for a parent. We almost \"joke\" that we hope someone's parent will die soon, so that he can help form the minyan.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this phenomenon occur commonly in other Conservative shuls, and it seems to happen far more in non-Orthodox shuls, from my observation. I've spoken to a few friends in different parts of the U.S. as well as two congregational rabbis, and they have noticed a similar pattern.</p>\n\n<p>\"It seems that non-Orthodox people see the importance of the minyan only when there's death, rather than as a part of daily living,\" remarked one rabbi. I see his point, somewhat. But, I can't explain why that is?</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone explain why only death attracts people to come more regularly to the minyan? Do these people form a sense of \"guilt\" if they didn't honor their mom or dad by saying Kaddish or hiring someone to say it for them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>It's something like that, based on my observations of my local Reform and Conservative communities. What I notice in particular with the Conservative daily <em>minyan</em> is that there are some regulars, some people who just come to say <em>kaddish</em>, and some people who <em>initially came</em> to say <em>kaddish</em> (for a month or for a year; I don't mean one day) and then stuck around.</p>\n\n<p>I think saying <em>kaddish</em> for a parent is in the same category as having a Pesach <em>seder</em> -- it's a deeply-ingrained <em>thing you do, even if you aren't strongly committed to Judaism</em>.  I know secular Jews, atheists, who nonetheless do these things; the ones I've asked about their <em>sedarim</em> cited tradition and culture.  I've never asked anybody about <em>kaddish</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If you're trying to strengthen your <em>minyan</em> and are looking for help from people saying <em>kaddish</em>, I recommend focusing on the ones who are in mourning (who are coming every day for a period), and working on <em>making them feel part of the community</em>.  Too many people, especially in the liberal movements, see synagogues as providers of consumer services -- I need a place to say Kaddish today, I need a place for my kid's bar mitzvah next year, I need a place for Yom Kippur, etc.  So long as they think going to synagogue is only relevant if they need a service, they'll be <em>kaddish</em>-only (or High Holy Day-only, etc) attendees.  Once they realize there's something <em>more</em> for them, they might come more often, even when they don't have an immediate \"need\" like to say <em>kaddish</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you do, don't try to guilt-trip them.  If, on the day they <em>actually showed up</em>, they only hear complaints about how people only come for <em>kaddish</em> and how awful that is, they're not likely to come back on a \"regular\" day.  If, on the other hand, they feel welcomed and comforted, if they start to make friends in the <em>minyan</em>, if people get to know them and -- simple thing here -- greet them by name -- then they just might come to value the community and not just the service.</p>\n\n<p>They might not -- lots don't.  But you build a small <em>minyan</em> person by person.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I wholly agree with Monica's excellent answer, but I would like to point out another phenomenon.  Many non-Orthodox Jews go through a portion of their adult lives without giving much thought to religious practice.  A traumatic event like the death of a parent can cause them to re-evaluate their lives.</p>\n\n<p>They may see the end of the long chain of familial tradition just \"dangling in the breeze\" and ask themselves if they really should be the generation that it ends with.  People at this point have to make a decision that they may have never considered from an adult point of view.  It is one thing to jettison tradition at age thirteen.  It is something very different to at age thirty. This can sometimes be the point when a person matures and comes to re-embrace their heritage.  I know a few people who (re)turned to active involvement with Judaism only after a child's birth or a parent's death.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This answer is solely based on my own personal experience with no Halachic references available.</p>\n\n<p>When my sister died I took it very hard.

I'm assuming that they contain missing or rubbed-out letters, and other errors that would invalidate using the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Our shul occasionally brings in a <em>sofer</em> (scribe) to evaluate a few scrolls. He has checked a few of them and said that they are \"beyond being repaired\". I don't know who the <em>sofer</em> is, but when I asked the head of the ritual committee who had met with the <em>sofer</em> he said that in one case, the <em>sofer</em> said that the parchment was too brittle to make a correction. In another, he said that he probably could correct it, but because of the parchment's poor condition, it would fade again in a few months, and he would have to continuously correct it, which would make it a costly proposition.</p>\n\n<p>I've listed two conditions that I'm aware of that would \"unqualify\" fixing a Torah. One, I see, is a physical condition, but I'd like to know what \"too brittle\" really means and how a <em>sofer</em> evaluates this.</p>\n\n<p>The second criterion seemed to be cost-related. Does that factor qualify to not even bother fixing the Torah? In this case, the shul has enough spare scrolls, that they can manage with others, though, as a Torah reader, I believe that every Torah is precious and should be salvaged even temporarily. Can one make cost a factor?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, what other factors would allow a sofer or shul to dispense from repairing a Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There could be a variety of problems with the klaf. </p>\n\n<p>Klaf is made from the skin of cows. A \"fresh\" klaf has a texture or grain of \"pores\" which absorb the ink and hold it to the klaf. With time and use the texture/pore become smooth and the adhesion of the klaf becomes suspect, i.e the repairs (new ink) dont stick to the klaf.</p>\n\n<p>Certain older klafs have an additional problem that they were coated with some sort of material (I think its some sort of plaster or lime) before they were written on. When this coating begins to deteriorate, fixing the torah is impossible due to the fact that as you try to make corrections additional adjacent parts of the klaf get damaged.</p>\n\n<p>If the original sofer had a consistent issue that affects the entire scroll, like if a certain letter was improperly written or written in a way that makes it susceptible to becoming pasul, it becomes difficult to fix due to the large amount of work involved. If he had problems with many letters or with taggim it may cost significantly more than writing a new Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Age can also cause the ink to fade or discolour, in some cases this causes the torah to be pasul. (I have seen a Torah in which the letters tuned RED!) Fixing such a sefer can equal a almost total rewrite, which can cost many times the cost of a new sefer (due to the need for erasure before writing) and may be impossible due to the condition of the klaf.</p>\n\n<p>If the issue is a problem with the way one of Hashem's names is written, in some cases the psul in not correctable, the only solution being the replacement of the particular piece of parchment (Yeria).</p>\n\n<p>If the Torah has such problems on many different pieces of parchment the Torah is unfixable.</p>\n\n<p>If the writing in the sefer torah is of poor quality (very bidieved) a sofer may advise not atempting a fix of many small issues due to the cost vs benefit of buying a new Torah.</p>\n\n<p>If the particular Torah has any special significance, i.e. belonged to a famous rabbi or chassidic rebbe, was rescued from germany during the holocaust or was originaly written by a famous sofer, some people may decide that it is worth to repair the scroll even a a price many times that of a new scroll.</p>\n\n\n",

For the other 5 relatives (brother, sister, spouse, or [R\"L,] son or daughter), one tears on the right side.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it is inappropriate to show such an intense form of mourning on Shabbos or after the Shiva. To clarify, this is only appropriate for the shiva, unless the Kri'ah was never done (or the ribbon was used, which is insufficient.) In a case where someone did not do the Kri'ah, either because he wasn't aware of the requirement or because he just heard about the loss after the Shiva was concluded, he should do the Kri'ah on that day only.</p>\n\n\n",

Beginning with the days of Enosh when idol-worship came into existence, opinions in the matter of faith fell into error. Some people denied the root of faith by saying that the world is eternal; they denied the Eternal, and said: It is not He [Who called forth the world into existence]. Others denied His knowledge of individual matters, and they say, How doth G-d know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? Some admit His knowledge but deny the principle of providence and make men as the fishes of the sea, [believing] that G-d does not watch over them and that there is no punishment or reward for their deeds, for they say the Eternal hath forsaken the land. Now when G-d is pleased to bring about a change in the customary and natural order of the world for the sake of a people or an individual, then the voidance of all these [false beliefs] becomes clear to all people, since a wondrous miracle shows that the world has a G-d Who created it, and Who knows and supervises it, and Who has the power to change it. And when that wonder is previously prophesied by a prophet, another principle is further established, namely, that of the truth of prophecy, that G-d doth speak with man, and that He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets, and thereby the whole Torah is confirmed. This is why Scripture says in connection with the wonders [in Egypt]: That thou [Pharaoh] mayest know that I am the Eternal in the midst of the earth (Shemot 8:18), which teaches us the principle of providence, i.e., that G-d has not abandoned the world to chance, as they [the heretics] would have it; That thou mayest know that the earth is the Eternal's, which informs us of the principle of creation, for everything is His since He created all out of nothing; That thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth, which indicates His might, i.e., that He rules over everything and that there is nothing to withhold Him. The Egyptians either denied or doubted all of these [three] principles, [and the miracles confirmed their truth].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(And in some circles by the groom.)</p>\n\n<p>Once he has made the Kinyan he has <em>said</em> everything in the Ketuva, even if he didn't express it verbally. (Similar to every contract where you didn't <em>nod</em> at every clause that says <em>...party agreed</em>. Once you sign, you've agreed.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Michtav M'Eliyahu, R' Dessler has a chapter where he explains that when chazal say that someone or something \"says\" something it means that the state of their existence logically implies such a thing. For example, the mishnayos in maseches Parah which have different inanimate objects \"saying\" things to other inanimate objects.</p>\n\n<p>So it could be that the chosson, by saying \"harei at...\" has also \"said\" the rest of the declaration.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Suppose I want to borrow $100 from you. You're a busy person, so if I ask for a loan, you'll tell me it's too much trouble to go to a lawyer, fill out a loan document, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So here's what I do: I fill out the paperwork ahead of time, sign it, and <em>then</em> come and ask for a loan. You say, \"But it's too much paperwork!\" I reply, \"Nope, did it for you. Give me the $100 and I'll give you the document.\"</p>\n\n<p>The paperwork says, \"X lent Y $100.\" When I wrote it, that hadn't happened yet (and potentially may never happen). So although it superficially claims a set of facts, it fundamentally is asserting, \"X agrees that if Y is holding this paper, then it shall serve as evidence that X lent Y $100.\" </p>\n\n<p>So if it's signed by witnesses, they're not saying that the loan happened; they're saying that the borrower consented to write this document. The combination of that and the lender holding the document is the evidence that the loan happened.</p>\n\n<p>The parallel holds true by the ketuba. The witnesses testify that the groom agreed to this prenuptial contract. They don't care whether the groom will end up saying the contents or not, just like they don't care whether X got $100 or just gave the document to Y. This is implicit in the signing of the document.</p>\n\n<p>At least that's the theoretical basis for how it works, according to halacha.</p>\n\n<p>And, by the way, the groom says at least the first part of that sentence at the kiddushin: \"Be my wife according to the law of Moses and Israel.\"</p>\n\n\n",

If that's the case, are there guidelines about how to determine what's too dishonest that could apply here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>[As usual] I'd like to point out, that the problem with גניבת דעת or הונאה is two-fold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>[A sort of] \"damaging\" your fellow Jew, which stems from \"לא תגנובו\" and similar to it (ריטב\"א חולין צד, א) which is בין אדם לחבירו and the result is that one has to repay (or to appease) the fellow.</p></li>\n<li><p>The \"actor\" transgressing multiple Mitzvot by himself and his evil intention, like ואהבת לרעך כמוך, תמים תהיה עם ה'א', והלכת בדרכיו and many more, that are בין אדם למקום and therefore one has to do Teshuva to repent.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To your question, <strong>if the original intention WAS evil it is already a sin</strong> [and therefore forbidden], even if the ad was never actually shown as per #2.</p>\n\n<p>If the intention was sincere, the bottomline is that there's seemingly nothing wrong, because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>the rule in damages is \"המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה\"  - the damaged side must prove his loss.

For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came he that is the prince; but the birthright was Joseph's—<br>\n  ― 1 Chronicles 5:1–2 (JPS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>If</strong> [as I understand], one of the rights of being a first-born meant the King and eventually the Messaiah was to be descended from the first born, and this passed from Rueben to Judah, skipping Simeon, Levi, what then did Joseph get with his being given the birthright? What does \"birthright\" really mean [in Judaism]?</p>\n\n<p><hr></p>\n\n<p>The best and correct answer will correct any misunderstanding on my part.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The \"birthright\" as used here that went to Yoseph is the \"double portion\".</p>\n\n<p>The Artscroll commentary on Reuven cites Targum Yonasan as pointing out that there were three items that had been originally given to the first born.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>you do not deserve to serve in the superior positions that were\n  designated for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Targum Yonatan says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But because you sinned my son, the birthright is given to Yoseph, the\n  kingship to Yehudah, and the priesthood to Levi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once Reuven lost the three elements of the bechorah, Yaakov divided them to the most appropriate children.</p>\n\n<p>Yoseph as the firstborn of Rachel and as the savior of the family (and ruler in Mitzraim) was the most appropriate to receive the \"double portion\". This was expressed when Yoseph's two children were raised to the status of tribe in themselves. ויחי 48:3</p>\n\n<p>Note that Rashi says that each of Bnai Yisrael received the same amount of land so that Ephraim and Menashe received the same amount in total that they would have received as the tribe of Yosef. It was only the honor of banners and marching as separate tribes that caused them to have a \"double portion\"</p>\n\n<p>Ramban says that each tribe received 1/12 of the land which was then divided so that Ephraim and Menashe now received two portions of land which was the double portion of the \"birthright\".</p>\n\n<p>Note also that verse 21 has Yoseph given an extra portion (Shechem) as well, though Maharshal says this was in gratitude to the oath he swore to his father. Others say it refers to the extra tribe as above.</p>\n\n<p>@hazoriz pointed to (as well as other pointers in the comments above)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצודת דוד על דברי הימים א ה, א כי הוא הבכור . ר''ל עם כי הוא הבכור\n  והיה א''כ מהראוי להזכיר יחוסו ראשון : ובחללו . אבל בעת שחלל ובזה יצועי\n  אביו ובלבלה לבל יהא מצוי תדיר אצל בלהה אז נלקחה הבכורה מעמו ונתנה\n  ליוסף להיות נוטל פי שנים כבכור להיות בניו נחלקים לשני שבטים :</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that even though Yosef is worthy of the honor of the bechor, he cannot become the leader of the Bnai Yisrael because he triggered jealousy among his brothers and thus could not bring them together in unity.</p>\n\n<p>Note that in 49:26 Yaakov calls Yoseph \"<em>Nezir Echav</em>\" which means the \"<em>morally ennobled one</em>\" and not the crowned one.</p>\n\n<p>My own comment is that we see that Yerav'am split the kingdom and showed that this flaw could still reveal itself.</p>\n\n<p>Levi because of his zeal and feeling of brotherhood was fit for the Kehunah but because of his trait of anger the zeal disqualified him for the malchus. That is why Yaakov said that they had to be split up among the Bnai Yisrael and live on the terumos and maasros but not inherit land. This dependence on his brethren also made him unfit for the meluchah.</p>\n\n<p>My own comment here is that we see what happened when the Chashmonaim took on the role of prince and king and how it led to their downfall.</p>\n\n<p>Yehudah was the one who Rav Hirsch says in 49:10</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This trend in Yehudah's character to have influence in the nation both\n  internally and externally befitted him for \"scepter and lawgiving\n  style\", to be the Lord Protector of both material and spiritual\n  forces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My own comment here is that he was the one who stepped forward to protect Binyamin, who recognized and admitted his mistakes with the sale of Yoseph and the incident of Tamar. He was the one that Yaakov sent ahead to Mitzraim to prepare the way for the Bnai Yisrael to live in Goshen. He was thus the one who deserved the Malchus.</p>\n\n<p>As we see, Yaakov recognized that these three aspects that would normally have been granted to Reuven as the bechor had to be split to three different elements of his children.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is herring used for tikun?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many people have the practice, on the yahrzeit of (especially) a parent, of bringing food to the synagogue so that others might recite <em>b'rachos</em> (benedictions) over eating the food after <em>shacharis</em>, which are meant to benefit the deceased. They call this food <em>tikun n'shama</em>, or just <em>tikun</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the most common foods offered as <em>tikun</em> (in my experience in several Orthodox synagogues) are drinks, egg <em>kichel</em>, batter cake, and herring. Why herring?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's relatively expensive (certainly when compared to the <em>kichel</em> and batter cake).</li>\n<li>If the idea is to promote the recitation of <em>b'rachos</em>, herring doesn't help, as it shares <em>b'rachos</em> (fore- and after-) with the drinks.</li>\n<li>Although it's tasty<sup>[1]</sup>, I don't think it will be missed terribly if absent. Herring without a drink or <em>kichel</em> would cause people to seek something to wash down the herring; <em>kichel</em> and a drink without herring is perfectly palatable and Part Of Your Complete Breakfast.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So why herring?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1] YMMV.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is not a definite reason, but it may be in memory of the teaching of Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav found in <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_74.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Bathra 74b</a> which talks about the Leviathan that was salted and stored away by HaShem for the Tzaddikim in the world to come, meaning after the resurrection of the dead. There will be a special meal which will include salted fish.</p>\n\n<p>It would be suggesting that soul will be resurrected and included in that meal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You can read <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/recipe/herring-and-onions/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> in full, but I’ll just quote the important part below. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most likely, the fish became popular among Eastern European Jews for practical reasons: <strong>it was cheap.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>—————\n<em>some edits</em></p>\n\n<p>Based on some of the comments I’d like to add some clarification. Although <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67214/16706\">Yaakov Dean’s answer</a> is quite clever, it does not attempt to explain why herring was used, because they could have (in his scenario) salted any fish of their choosing. (Refer to my answer above on why they chose herring.)</p>\n\n<p>As for the original question, the points raised are quite valid ones, and this is a very fair question. And it makes sense to question all things, and determine their sources. </p>\n\n<p>Going on the information that herring was cheap, that would mean that it was ever cheaper than anything else in this context. (Including that which was mentioned in the question.)</p>\n\n<p>Using some reasoning however, I would conclude that based on that which I said above, there aren’t any other <em>hidden</em> reasons to the fish. Similarly as is found by the Shtreimel. It was cold back in Europe. As is quoted from the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtreimel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shtreimel Wikipedia page:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While there is strong religious custom for Jewish males to cover their heads, from the standpoint of Jewish law <strong>there is no special religious significance to the shtreimel</strong> as compared to other head coverings. However, the wearing of two head coverings is considered to add additional spiritual merit, plus the presence of beautiful craftsmanship adds beautification and honor to the custom. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You may note on that page, that later on someone added on additional symbolism, but that was not the original intention. </p>\n\n<p>And I do believe that this is the same situation present by herring. Even though now it may not be economical, it certainly was. And there may even be extra symbolism added on for good measure. </p>\n\n<p><em>plus it’s tasty.</em></p>\n\n\n",

If\na leaf flutters in the wind and lands in a particular location it is\nby Divine providence. However, the Divine plan in nature is not easily\ndiscernable. The word for nature in Hebrew is teva, which actually\nmeans “submerged.” That is so because the truth and reality of G-d’s\nplan for every detail of the universe is submerged beneath the\nsurface. It takes a spiritual “deep sea diver” to discover this Divine\ntruth.</p>\n<p>But Torah is different.</p>\n<p>The word Torah is related to the word for light. In Aramaic the word\nfor Torah is Oraisa, which means “that which brings light.”\nFurthermore, the Torah is described in the book of Proverbs as a\nsource of light. This metaphor suggests that those things which may be\nconcealed and submerged within nature are clear and exposed in Torah.</p>\n<p>The fact that these three distinct Torah texts share the same number\nof verses/pages is no coincidence and conveys a profound message.</p>\n<p>What is it about these three texts that convey a uniform message\nrelated to the number 176?</p>\n<p>On the level of remez, the hints that are associated with gematria,\nthe number 176 is the numerical value of the word l’olam-forever.</p>\n<p><strong>RAISING OUR HEADS</strong></p>\n<p>The parsha of Naso is always read in conjunction with the Festival of\nShavuos, the anniversary of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. It\nbegins with the words “Naso es Rosh,” which is translated as “take a\ncensus” or “count the heads.” However, a more literal rendition yields\nthe following translation: “Lift up the heads.”</p>\n<p>This has been interpreted as an allusion to the Torah, which uplifts\nour heads. Without Torah, our minds engage the world of natural\nwisdom, science, philosophy, history, business, etc. In short, this is\nthe level of knowledge within human reach. With Torah, however, our\nminds are elevated and allow us to grasp G-dly knowledge which\ntranscends nature. Every time we engage in Torah study our minds are\nelevated, and through the elevation of our minds our bodies and\npersonalities are uplifted as well.</p>\n<p>The Talmud (P’sachim 68b) records a statement of the sage Rabbi Yosef\nconcerning the virtue of the Holiday of Shavuos:</p>\n<p>“If not for this day that caused it, there would have been many\nJosephs in the marketplace.”</p>\n<p>Rashi explains that what he meant was that, as a result of this\nspecial day in which the Torah was given, he became uplifted and\nexalted.</p>\n<p>Why did Rabbi Yosef feel uplifted because of Torah?</p>\n<p>The answer, of course, is that Torah doesn’t just inspire and guide\nus; its unique aspect is the manner in which it raises our intellect\nto a higher plane.</p>\n<p>What is it about Torah that makes it so unique in relation to other\ndisciplines, that endows it with this power to elevate the one who\nstudies it?</p>\n<p><strong>L’OLAM-FOREVER!</strong></p>\n<p>The answer lies in the word l‘olam, which conveys a double message\nbased on two possible translations of this word.</p>\n<p>The first translation is “forever,” as we say in the Boruch shem\nprayer after the Shma, “Blessed is the name of His glorious kingdom\nl’olam-forever.”</p>\n<p>G-d is eternal. As He created the laws of nature, G-d is not bound by\nthem. So while created beings are, by definition, ephemeral because\nthey have a beginning and must therefore have an end, the Creator, who\nhas no beginning, also has no end. Whereas creation exists because of\nthe act of creation, G-d just exists because He must exist. His\nexistence is absolute; he must exist. Our existence is circumstantial;\nwe just happen to exist.</p>\n<p>The same is true of the Torah, which is Divine wisdom. It too must be\neternal because, as Maimonides writes, “G-d and His wisdom are one,”\ninseparable.</p>\n<p>Thus, the number 176, which is equivalent to the word l’olam, is\nassociated with the parsha that speaks of the elevating character of\nTorah. What elevates us above the rest of the world of knowledge is\nthat Torah is inherently eternal because it springs from the Eternal\nG-d.</p>\n<p>Thus, Parshas Naso with its 176 verses highlights the power of Torah\nto elevate us.</p>\n<p>This is further buttressed by the fact that it consists of eight\nverses for each letter of the alphabet. The number eight is a\ntranscendent number, because it goes beyond the number seven, which\nrepresents the cycle of nature. The number eight is connected to\nMoshiach, in whose time the harp in the Beis HaMikdash will have eight\nstrands as opposed to King David’s harp. The letters of the alphabet\ncorrespond to all of our faculties, “from a to z,” as they say. By\nrepeating each letter/verse eight times we elevate ourselves to a\nhigher transcendent level.</p>\n<p><strong>L’OLAM – TO THE WORLD</strong></p>\n<p>The word l’olam also has an alternate meaning: “To the world.” In\nother words, the same Torah that is so other-worldly, was directed to\nand relates to our very temporal and limited world. Torah, by\ncontrast, is both divinely eternal and eminently relevant.</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to all other areas of knowledge; the more abstract\nand ethereal the knowledge, the less it can relate to everyday,\nmundane and quotidian life.</p>\n<p>This duality of Torah is expressed in Psalm 119.</p>\n<p>Psalm 119 is unique. It is the most powerful, passionate and lengthy\nexpression of King David’s love for the Torah. In this psalm, King\nDavid speaks simultaneously of the wondrous and infinite nature of\nTorah and how the Torah was so relevant to his life; indeed,\nlife-saving.</p>\n<p>This psalm thus expresses the dual nature of Torah and of the word\nl’olam-ethereal and ephemeral, infinite and finite, elusive and\naccessible.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the word l’olam appears nine times in Psalm 119, more\nthan in any other chapter in the entire Tanach (except for Psalm 136,\nwhere the same phrase “ki l’olam chasdo” is repeated 26 times).</p>\n<p><strong>L’OLAM-THE ETERNAL BOND WITH THE JEWISH PEOPLE</strong></p>\n<p>There is another manifestation of the Divine power of eternality. It\nis the relationship G-d has with the Jewish people and, through them,\nto the entire world. This relationship is expressed by the Beis\nHaMikdash-the Holy Temple. We see this in the initial commandment of\nG-d to build a Sanctuary: “Make for Me a sanctuary and I will dwell in\nthem.” The word “them” here refers to the entire Jewish people, who\nwere betrothed to G-d for all eternity through the medium of the Beis\nHaMikdash.</p>\n<p>This relationship is described by the prophet Hoshea (2:21): “And I\nwill betroth you unto Me l’olam-forever.”</p>\n<p>In general terms, this relationship began at Sinai. It was advanced\nwhen the Mishkan was built and further enhanced through King Solomon’s\nconstruction of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. When G-d chose Jerusalem\nand the Temple Mount in particular as the site for the Temple, it was\nestablished from above as the eternal city and location for G-d’s\nspecial home. No other place could ever be designated as G-d’s\ndwelling place and the place to which we bring all our offerings.\nIndeed, since the construction of the Beis HaMikdash, all of our\nprayers are directed there and ascend to heaven through that site.</p>\n<p>The eternal nature of the Holy Temple was restricted to the spiritual\nrealm. Since the destruction of the Beis HaMikdash, we do not have a\nphysical structure in which heaven and earth come together.</p>\n<p>This will be remedied with the coming of Moshiach, who will build the\nthird, final and permanent Beis HaMikdash.</p>\n<p><strong>BAVA BASRA: THE THIRD TRACTATE AND BEIS HAMIKDASH</strong></p>\n<p>Where is this notion of a permanent dwelling place in the Third Beis\nHaMikdash hinted?</p>\n<p>According to a talk of the Rebbe (Seifer HaSichos 5752 – Parshas\nMishpatim) it is in the Tractate called Bava Basra.</p>\n<p>The section of the Mishna and Talmud called Nezikin-Damages contains\none long tractate that has been divided into three parts, which deal\nwith torts, theft, commerce, partnerships, neighbors, inheritance,\ncontracts, etc. In short, this three-part tractate deals with Jewish\ncriminal and civil law involving property.</p>\n<p>The three sub-tractates are called, Bava Kama-first section, Bava\nMetzia-middle section and Bava Basra-last section, respectively.</p>\n<p>According to the Zohar, the three tractates correspond to the three\nTemples. Bava Basra represents the third and final Temple that will\nnever be destroyed because it will be built by Moshiach, about whom\nthe prophet Ezekiel writes that he shall be the nasi-leader l’olam\nforever.</p>\n<p>Collectively, these tractates, called Nezikin-damages, deal with\nconflict and damage which are obvious symbols of the division and\ndysfunction of Galus-exile. Study of each tractate that focuses on how\nto repair our broken and conflicted relationships brings us closer to\nthe Messianic Age and the Final Redemption. It follows that the final\nsection of this “trilogy” deals and provides us with the final blow to\nexile that enables Moshiach to build the third Beis HaMikdash. In\naddition, Bava Basra contains many of the sages’ teachings concerning\nthe events to transpire in the Messianic Age.</p>\n<p>Thus Bava Basra, dealing as it does with the ultimate Redemption and\nthe final and permanent Beis HaMikdash, has 176 pages; the numerical\nvalue of the word l’olam-eternal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Excellent example is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0521.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dvarim 21:9</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, Shemot 35:3 should be translated \"do not eradicate fire\".</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The root (בער) as listed in Jastrow has several different meanings depending on the context. </p>\n\n<p>For example, (בער) meaning to burn is found in Shemot Rabbah 2:5 which says, \"since the bush burned...\"\n<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.2.5/he/Daat_Shemot_Rabbah?qh=%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%2B%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%A8&lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.2.5/he/Daat_Shemot_Rabbah?qh=הסנה%2Bבוער&lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all</a></p>\n\n<p>And in Bamidbar Rabbah, parshat Naso, 9:46, which says, \"for those burning with (desire for) idol worship...\"\n<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bemidbar_Rabbah.9.46/he/Daat_Bemidbar_Rabbah?qh=%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D&lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sefaria.org/Bemidbar_Rabbah.9.46/he/Daat_Bemidbar_Rabbah?qh=לבוערים&lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all</a></p>\n\n<p>But it also means 'to remove' as is found in Mishnah Sheviyit 7:7, which says, \"they require removal...this is the general rule, everything which imparts taste must be removed from that which doesn't.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וֶרֶד חָדָשׁ שֶׁכְּבָשׁוֹ בְּשֶׁמֶן יָשָׁן, יְלַקֵּט אֶת הַוֶּרֶד. וְיָשָׁן בְּחָדָשׁ, חַיָּב בַּבִּעוּר. חָרוּבִין חֲדָשִׁים שֶׁכְּבָשָׁן בְּיַיִן יָשָׁן, וִישָׁנִים בְּחָדָשׁ, חַיָּבִין בַּבִּעוּר. זֶה הַכְּלָל, כָּל שֶׁהוּא בְנוֹתֵן טַעַם, חַיָּב לְבַעֵר, מִין בְּשֶׁאֵינוֹ מִינוֹ. וּמִין בְּמִינוֹ, כָּל שֶׁהוּא. שְׁבִיעִית אוֹסֶרֶת כָּל שֶׁהוּא בְּמִינָהּ, וְשֶׁלֹּא בְמִינָהּ, בְּנוֹתֵן טָעַם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It can also mean to consume or to clear away as is found in Bava Kamma 2b, which says, \"And it shall consume (Shemot 22:4) denotes tooth, as expressed (in Melachim-1, 14:1) 'as the street sweeper  clears away his filth'</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובער (שמות כב:ד) זו השן וכן הוא אומר (מלכים-א יד:י) כאשר יבער</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And it also means 'to kindle or start a fire, as is found in Shemot 35:3, like it says, \"לא תבערו אש בכל מושבתיכם\", 'You will not kindle fire in all your dwellings...\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are several perspectives bearing on the issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Samaritan Pentateuch</strong></p>\n\n<p>Instead of the word תְבַעֲר֣וּ found in the Masoretic Text, the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/interlinearpentateuch/exodus-shemot/chapter-35-1-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a> instead understands the word to be תַבְעִירוּ, which is the first person plural of the same Hebrew verb, but in the <em>hifʿîl</em> (imperfect). Since the context is Moses speaking to the people, the reading would be, “We are not to extinguish fire in your dwellings on the Sabbath Day.” Although this reading appears awkward in both English and Biblical Hebrew, the verse would be consistent with <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0306.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 6:4</a>, which commands that the fire of the tabernacle never be extinguished. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Babylonian Talmud</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud addresses this very verse at great length (see for example, <em>Yevamoth</em>, <a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_soncino.php?ms=Yevamoth&df=6b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Folio 6B and Folio 7a</a> or <em>Sanhedrin</em>, <a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_soncino.php?ms=Sanhedrin&df=35b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Folio 35B and Folio 36A</a>). That is, the Talmud accepts the reading of the Masoretic Text, which is that fires will not be ignited on the Sabbath (under certain circumstances). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Jerusalem Talmud</strong></p>\n\n<p>The best Talmudic summary on this question appears in the Tractate <em>Beitzah</em> of the Talmud Yerushalmi, which is the tractate concerning festivals; in this regard, this Talmud also accepts the reading of the Masoretic Text, which is that fires will not be ignited on the Sabbath (under certain circumstances).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhilta\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>the Mekilta de-Rabbi Ishmael</em></a> is a classic collection of halakhic midrash to the Book of Exodus. This midrash compilation accepts the reading of the Masoretic Text, which is that fires will not be ignited on the Sabbath (under certain circumstances).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>In summary, oral tradition leans toward the reading that the word תְבַעֲר֣וּ found in the Masoretic Text means do not ignite fire on the Sabbath (under certain circumstances).</p>\n\n\n",

Gerizim, the site of their place of worship).</p>\n<p>This is codified as halachah in Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 215:2).\nMishnah Berurah there (subsection 6) records variant opinions as to\nwhether this applies only when one heard everything from Hashem's name\nonwards (i.e., basically the entire blessing except for the words\n\"baruch atah\"), or if it is also when one hears just the very end of\nthe blessing (e.g., \"borei minei mezonos\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is if <em>remiza</em> (signing / hinting) would be an equivalent. Some scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If an interpreter signs just a part of the bracha to the deaf person</li>\n<li>If an interpreter signs to the deaf, \"He just said 'Borei Minei Mezonos', and we all answer 'Amen'\"</li>\n<li>If the deaf person notices someone's lips moving (he noticed it in the middle of the person's <em>bracha</em>), saw him holding a cookie, saw him eat the cookie. so, the deaf person assumed that he was reciting 'Borei Minei Mezonot' (I mention this scenario, as Shulchan Aruch stipulates that the person answering must be aware of <em>which</em> bracha was said. But, here, the deaf person deduced the bracha, but can't be 100% certain as he didn't hear it and no one interpreted.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In either / both of these cases, can the deaf person answer \"Amen\".</p>\n<p>(I have assumed that signing the <strong>entire</strong> bracha as it is occurring would be the same as having verbally 'said' it. This assumption is based on a number of related halachot regarding tefillah / signing for the deaf that I have heard from Our Way - a division of the OU.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Sorry, but from the Shulchan Aruch and Simla Chadasha (below) it seems signing does not count for Brochois.<br/>\nBut for prayer see my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/63904/5120\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/63904/5120</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>You can answer Omain</strong> if you did not hear anything only you know what the Brocho is about.

And why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I can see that just the 3rd verse would seem confusing, and I was puzzled by this one, as well.</p>\n\n<p>All work (that is, the 39 categories of <em>melacha</em> assigned for Shabbat) are prohibited <strong>except</strong> for <em>melacha</em> that is necessary for food consumption such as cooking, baking, slaughtering, etc. (I won't delve, here, into the \"extension\" of the rule such as carrying objects that are not related to food consumption, which is permissible, to an extent.)</p>\n\n<p>The 2nd verse makes this clear.</p>\n\n<p>The 1st verse is clear, also, that food-related melacha is permitted. You cited only part of the verse. Here's the entire verse using Sefaria English translation:</p>\n\n<p>Exodus 12:16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּבַיּ֤וֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן֙ מִקְרָא־קֹ֔דֶשׁ וּבַיּוֹם֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י\n  מִקְרָא־קֹ֖דֶשׁ יִהְיֶ֣ה לָכֶ֑ם כָּל־מְלָאכָה֙ לֹא־יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה בָהֶ֔ם\n  <strong>אַ֚ךְ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵאָכֵ֣ל לְכָל־נֶ֔פֶשׁ ה֥וּא לְבַדּ֖וֹ יֵעָשֶׂ֥ה לָכֶֽם׃</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in\n  the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in\n  them, <strong>save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by\n  you.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OK, now to the 3rd verse. You should read <em>Ha'emek Dvavar's</em> explanation that states that the reason for stating just plainly \"no work\" is only for the purposes of service and offering sacrifices to G-d. I.e. - that you should not be pre-occupied doing melacha that you forget to rest on this day. I'll try to add a link to it, later.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ancient Jewish Essene texts and history\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently when I visited Israel my family had a wonderful experience seeing the Dead Sea Scrolls and learning about Jewish life in the desert. When I grew up I had so little knowledge of this. I have 2 questions regarding the Essenes :</p>\n\n<p>Are there any authentic, ancient Jewish texts that are from the Essenes? I have learned a little about the Essenes from books, lectures and the Internet, but I am wondering if there are actual texts that I can read that have been passed down throughout the ages? I am specifically interested in their Jewish customs/traditions. </p>\n\n<p>I am also wondering what happened to the Essene Jewish traditions. I know that early Christians were considered Essene (and I think there is record of them--like the \"desert fathers\"?) but what happened to the Jewish Essenes who were not followers of Jesus? Was their philosophy passed on in Kabbalah or traditions that we might have now that are kept private? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A lot of the late Second Temple schisms are still the subjects of hot debate. As I understand it, the only primary source we have on the Essenes is Josephus; leading some historians to question their existence. (Yes, Ethics of the Fathers does talk about the foolishness of a \"what's mine is yours and yours is mine\" philosophy, which Lord Sacks reads as a reference to some commune-type sects at the time.)</p>\n\n<p>It's also debated which sect wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. From what I understand, Professor Schiffman believes it was the Sadducees, and Leiman is more inclined towards the Boethusians.  </p>\n\n<p>Of all the sects at that period, basically we have what became Christianity, and what became the mainstream Pharisee Judaism that was recorded in the Talmud. The other sects pretty much faded away, with whatever works they had. As far as I know, there's the Samaritan Bible; the Dead Sea Scrolls; and I believe the Book of Jubilees survived in some form (aside from the scrolls); but that's really about it. So as far as we know, all the other sects eventually folded into either Christianity or Judaism (well maybe eventually the Karaites), or into the broader surrounding cultures. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Drinking blood during Milah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to what I have read, there are problems with ingesting human blood. Questions like <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14788/is-autocannibalism-halachically-prohibited/14790#14790\">this</a> indicate that mar'is ayin applies.</p>\n\n<p>During metzitzah in a circumcision, the mohel takes some blood into his mouth but then spits it out. However, according to some scholarly sources, there was a practice in the middle ages of mixing that spitted out blood with wine and having the parents and/or the baby drink some.</p>\n\n<p>Here is one quote (and I don't know his sources, but I will also quote a corroborating historian)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After the mohel performs metzitzah, he traditionally spits the child's blood into a goblet of wine or sloshes the blood and wine in his mouth and expectorates into a cup. Then the mohel dips his finger and gives the child a taste. The boy's parents next take a sip, followed by the mohel. . . Today, most Jews sip only wine. But they once drank blood. . . Sipping the circumcision wine as wine rather than blood also dilutes the symbolic potency of the rite. The Torah , to repeat, firmly prohibits the consumption of blood, one of the premier laws incumbent on all of humanity and not just Jews. Yet paramount ritual remembrance of the covenant, with all its promise of progeny, requires participants to violate this decree by drinking a child's \"life force.\" \n  Eric Kline Silverman, From Abraham to America: A History of Jewish Circumcision, p. 138.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Germany in the high middle ages additional customs arose concerning the blood: the circumciser would spit the blood of metzitzah from his mouth into the cup of wine from which the baby would be given a few drops to drink\n  Shaye J. D. Cohen, A Brief History of Jewish Circumcision Blood (from, The Covenant of Circumcision: New perspectives on an Ancient Jewish Rite, edited by Elizabeth Wyner Mark).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And there are a few others. Now, I haven't checked these texts to see if their scholarship is right. They might all be extrapolating from a single anecdote in a single medieval text. But if the claim is even remotely true, wouldn't it have presented a halachic concern? Is there any source for this practice or discussion of its halachic status? Are there any sources which debunk these claims?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I've never, ever heard of such a thing (yuck!) and it wouldn't surprise me if the sources are distorted. But nonetheless, let's look at this from a halachic angle.</p>\n<p>Kesubos 60a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוא טמא ואין דם מהלכי שתים טמא אלא טהור ואמר רב ששת אפילו מצות פרישה אין בו לא קשיא הא דפריש הא דלא פריש וחלופא בדם כדתניא דם שעל גבי ככר גוררו ואוכלו שבין השינים מוצצו ואינו חושש</p>\n<p>Blood from animals is not kosher, but blood from humans is kosher. Furthermore, Rav Sheishes said there's not even a rabbinic prohibition to avoid it! However that all depends on whether the blood has been separated or not; human blood has the reverse laws [compared to human milk: an adult is allowed to drink a bottle of human milk, but not to suck it directly from the source]. As it was taught: <code>If [your mouth has a cut and] you see [your] blood on a piece of bread, scrape it off before eating the bread. Blood between your teeth, you're allowed to suck it without any concern.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explains: the prohibition on human blood is that if people see you drinking a cup of blood, they may think it's from a non-human. But sucking blood is permissible as it never \"separated\" and fell under that prohibition.</p>\n<p>Thus: human blood is never biblically prohibited; and in the circumstances discussed, probably doesn't fall under the rabbinic prohibition either.</p>\n\n\n",

I thought, \"Now, why don't they just throw away those things? Nobody is going to want that set!\"  I was surprised, then, at just how quickly the \"seller\" emailed the group back and declared in ALLCAPS that the items were TAKEN!!!!! (with many exclamation marks), clearly seeking to stem the flow of some email bombardment of interested recipients.</p>\n\n<p>For half a moment, I thought of posting a similar offer, just to see how much interest there would be, and then just telling all interested parties that the items had been claimed by someone else.  It immediately struck me, however, that this would certainly be unethical, but perhaps could be done as part of a study*.  Now, though, I'm curious: Is it ethical, that is, in accordance with Jewish law and philosophy, to conduct a psychological survey of this sort? There is no tangible harm, but it is false and misleading, though it would satisfy some curious (and potentially psychologically valuable) need to know how people react to certain stimuli.  But it's a lie.  But we can learn from it.  But it's misleading.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of a handful of issues, but I'm curious to know what recognized Posekim and traditional Jewish sources have to say about such matters.</p>\n\n<p><sub>*Please note: I am not a psychologist, nor do I have the wherewithal (or time) to conduct such a study. I just want to know if these things are deemed ethical in Judaism.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> 228:1 says that included in the prohibition of <em>onaas d'varim</em>, causing pain with words, is this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He shall not say to his fellow, \"For how much [money] are you willing to give [me] this item?\" [if] he has no desire to buy it. Or, if donkey-drivers were asking him [if they could] buy grain [from him], he shall not tell them, \"Go to so-and-so\" [if] he knows that that [person] has no grain and will be dishonored — and even if he's a rich person who won't be dishonored, nonetheless the donkey-drivers will be embarrassed.

It may be similar enough that the <em>halacha</em> in your case, too, is that one may not make such an offer.</p>\n\n<p>The last case in the <em>AHS</em>, \"the donkey-drivers will be embarrassed\" by requesting grain of a rich person who has none, seems somewhat similar to your case also.

    "content": "# Rambam and altering brachot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34169/should-i-improvise-a-bracha-in-a-case-of-doubt?lq=1\">this question</a> and its comments:</p>\n\n<p>Rambam Laws of Brachot 1:5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The text of all the blessings was ordained by Ezra and his court. It\n  is not fit to alter it, to add to it, or to detract from it. Whoever\n  alters the text of a blessing from that ordained by the Sages is\n  making an error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the book Laws of B'rachos, Rabbi Aaron D. Twersky cites this to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The text for all b'rachos as we  know them today was settled upon by Ezra and his court (circa 350 B.C.E.). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet, as noted in the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34169/should-i-improvise-a-bracha-in-a-case-of-doubt?lq=1#comment87736_34176\">comments</a>, there were Amoraim, Rishonim, and Acharonim who apparently modified brachot. </p>\n\n<p>So this raises two interrelated questions for me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What did Rambam mean to say if he presumably knew about the Amoraim who altered brachot post-Ezra?</li>\n<li>How did the Rishonim and Acharonim who altered brachot post-Rambam feel at liberty to do so considering what the Rambam said?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some examples of post-Ezra brachot that come to mind include HaTov Vehametiv (in Birkat Hamazon), She'asani Kirtzono, Hanoten Leya'ef Koach, possibly the bracha for Shabbat candles, and many piyutim that are inserted into Shmoneh Esreh. There are probably many more examples; I can add them as they come to mind.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong><em>First, some background</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The idea that each traditional <em>berakhah</em> and <em>tefiyllah</em> that can be found within the prayerbook has a specific number of words - even a prescribed number of letters within each word - and that each one is thereby meant to express a mystical meaning through <em>gematriya</em> (thus \"proving\" that it was transmitted perfectly from the time of the <em>tannaiym</em> or earlier) is an idea that stems from Eli`ezer b. Yehudah of Worms in his <em>Sefer Roqeyah</em>. So entrenched is he in this idea that he states that one who changes even one letter of the <em>nosah</em> [Ashkenaz] is not accepted in <em>Shamayim</em> when he prays. This idea has now been proven by extant texts to be patently incorrect, as there are many ancient usages that all share a common core, the codifiers of which apparently paid no attention to either word count or <em>gematriya</em> - something already noted by the <em>Beyth Yosef</em> (cf. <em>Tur</em>, OH:113-122 - comments based on the <em>Abudaraham</em>). </p>\n\n<p>As for the view of the Rambam, one must remember to always carefully review the the construction of the text, as his choice of phrasing are often overlooked. His methodology is to both preserve the wording and terminology of the original Talmudic source(s) which he is codifying, as well as be exact regarding the nature and definition of the <em>halakhah</em> as he understands it. Also, the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> was intended by the Rambam to be taken <strong><em>in aggregate</em></strong>, using logic to sort out the path of the <em>halakhah</em> from all relative statements made regarding it throughout. Lastly, it is a well-known interpretive principle of <em>Hazal</em> that when they (and subsequently the Rambam in recording their words) make \"all\" or \"never\" statements, there is nearly \"always\" an exceptional case.</p>\n\n<p>Noting these things, let's re-examine the <em>halakhah</em> cited above.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in <em>Hilkhoth Berakhoth</em> 1:5-6 states the following:</p>\n\n<p>[5] <em>wa-nosah kol ha-berakhoth 3ezra uveyth dino tiqnum wa-eyn ra'uy le-shanothan wa-lo le-hosiyf 3al ahath mehen wa-lo lighroa3 mimmenah wa-khol ha-meshaneh mi-matbea3 she-tav3u hakhamiym ba-berakhoth eyno ela to3eh wa-khol berakhah she-eyn bah hazkarath hashem umalkhuth eynah berakhah ela im ken haythah semukhah la-havertah:</em></p>\n\n<p>\"And the wording of all the <em>berakhoth</em> was formulated by Ezra and his court, and it is not proper to change them - neither to add to them nor to subtract from them, and everyone who alters the 'coin' minted by the Sages is simply mistaken. And every <em>berakhah</em> that does not have the explicit mention of the Divine Name and the Divine Sovereignty is not a <em>berakhah</em> at all, unless it is <em>semukhah le-havertah</em> (\"next to her neighbor\" - i.e. directly follows a <em>berakhah</em> that does include the mention of the Divine Name and Sovereignty, which are considered to fulfill this requirement for the following <em>berakhah</em> as well).\"</p>\n\n<p>[6] <em>kol ha-berakhoth kullan ne'emariyn be-khol lashon wa-hu she-yomar ke-3inyan she-tiqenu hakhamiym wa-im shinah eth ha-matbea3 ho'iyl wa-hizkiyr azkarah umalkhuth wa-3inyan ha-berakhah wa-afilu bilshon hol yassa:</em></p>\n\n<p>\"All of the <em>berakhoth</em> may be said in any language, as long as one says them in keeping with the subject determined for them by the Sages, and if one altered the 'coin,' as long as he made explicit mention of the Divine Name, the Divine Sovereignty, and the subject of the <em>berakhah</em> - even in a language other than Hebrew - he fulfills his obligation.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a similar passage, the Rambam also says (<em>Hilkhoth Qiryath Shema3</em> 1:8):</p>\n\n<p>[8] <em>berakhoth ellu 3im she'ar kol ha-berakhoth ha-3arukhoth be-fiy kol yisra'el 3ezra uveyth diyno tiqenum wa-eyn adham rasha'iy lifhoth mehen wa-lo le-hosiyf 3aleyhen: maqom she-hithqiynu lahtom be-varukh eyno rasha'iy shello lahtom umaqom she-hithqiynu shello lahtom eyno rasha'iy lahtom: maqom she-hithqiynu shello liftoah be-varukh eyno rasha'iy liftoah umaqom she-hithqiynu liftoah be-varukh eyno rasha'iy shello liftoah: kelalo shela-davar kol ha-meshaneh mi-matbea3 she-tav3u hakhamiym ba-berakhoth harey zeh to3eh wa-hozer umevarekh ka-matbea3:</em></p>\n\n<p>\"These <em>berakhoth</em> - along with all the other <em>berakhoth</em> that are arranged in the mouth of every Jew - were formulated by Ezra and his court and it is not proper for anyone to shorten them or to add to them. In a place [within the overall corpus of <em>berakhoth</em>] where they determined that a <em>berakhah</em> should have a <em>hathimah</em> using 'Barukh...\" it is not proper to leave it out and where they determined that a <em>berakhah</em> should not have such a <em>hathimah</em> it is not proper to add one. In a place where they determined that a <em>berakhah</em> should not have a <em>pethihah</em> beginning with 'Barukh...' it is not proper to add one, and where they determined that a <em>berakhah</em> should have such a <em>pethihah</em>, it is not proper to leave it out. The general principle of the matter is this: whoever alters the 'coin' minted by the Sages with regard to <em>berakhoth</em>, behold such a one is in error and he must go back and pronounce the blessing in accordance with the 'coin.'\"</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, these two statements by the Rambam may appear to contradict each other, but keeping in mind the style and methodology of the Rambam we mentioned before let's parse out their meaning.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 'coin' that the Rambam mentions is the word <em>matbea3</em> (מטבע) and it is not his own invention. It is employed by the <em>Tosefta</em> (t.Berakhoth 4:5) and is subsequently found in both the <em>Talmudh Yerushalmi</em>y (y.Berakhoth 1:5; 5:2; 6:1-2; 9:1) and the <em>Bavliy</em> (b.Berakhoth 40b) as a <em>baraytha</em>. It is a reference to the formulation of the berakhoth; like each coin that is minted might have some internal differences, yet they all share the same basic structure and elements. So, <em>matbea3</em> may be understand as the \"essential nature/structure\" of a <em>berakhah</em>. There are several things included in the <em>matbea3</em>, which I will mention below.</li>\n<li>The word <em>nosah</em> (\"formulation\"/\"phrasing\") used here is a general term used for the overall concept and collective elements that make up <em>berakhoth</em> which were decided upon by Ezra and his court. It should not be understood according to common usage today, as a reference to the exact wording of each <em>berakhah</em>.</li>\n<li>The Rambam does mean to imply that since the time of Ezra there have been no changes or additions to the body of <em>berakhoth</em>. This may be seen from the fact that the Rambam himself talks about <em>Tannaiym</em> drafting <em>berakhoth</em> and elements of <em>tefiyllah</em> long the time of Ezra. However, as we shall see, these later <em>hakhamiym</em> possessed proper legal authority to do so and they also were constrained to follow the pattern of formulation for <em>berakhoth</em> that was initially legislated and determined by Ezra and the <em>Anshey Kenesseth HaGedholah</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the Rambam, we can extrapolate several things:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=80\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> The \"formulation\" (<em>nosah</em>) of <em>berakhoth</em> includes three elements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>(a) The 'coin' (<em>matbea3</em>)</li>\n<li>(b) The Divine Name (\"...<em>Adhonoy elohenu</em>...\", referred to by Rambam as the <em>azkarah</em>, which according to Rav Yosef Qafih z\"l and others indicates that the Rambam rejects the use of <em>kinuyyim</em> for HaShem in other languages - i.e. he requires that the Hebrew Names be used even when the rest of the <em>berakhah</em> is in a language other than Hebrew)</li>\n<li>(c) The Divine Sovereignty (referred to as the <em>malkhuth</em> - i.e. \"...<em>melekh ha-3olam</em>...\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[2] The 'coin' or <em>matbea3</em> itself contains two elements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>(a) The <em>3inyan</em> or subject matter of the <em>berakhah</em> as determined by the <em>hakhamiym</em>.</li>\n<li>(b) The <em>pethihah</em> or <em>hathimah</em> (or both).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From here we can see that the view of the Rambam - which is also commensurate with the textual evidence - regarding the altering of <em>berakhoth</em> is that while the mention of the Divine Name, the Divine Sovereignty, and the presence of a <em>pethihah</em> or <em>hathimah</em> (or both), may never change and still have the <em>mevarekh</em> be <em>yosse yedhey hovah</em>, the <em>3inyan</em> - although it should not be done on purpose - may mistakenly be changed and the <em>mevarekh</em> is still <em>yosse yedhey hovah</em>. This is clear from a careful reading of the texts. The <em>Radvaz</em> notes that when the Rambam says, <em>eyno ela to3eh</em> he means that such a one \"is merely mistaken (and does not have to repeat the <em>berakhah</em>)\" whereas when he says <em>harey zeh to3eh</em> he means that it is a complete error and thus one must repeat the <em>berakhah</em> according to its proper form. </p>\n\n<p>This also fits with the <em>Tosefta</em> (<em>t.Berakhoth</em> 4:5) on which the Rambam is basing himself which says:</p>\n\n<p>ר' יוסי אומר כל המשנה ממטבע שטבעו חכמים בברכות לא יצא רבי יהודה אומר כל שנשתנה מברייתו [ושנה ברכתו] יצא</p>\n\n<p>\"Rabbi Yosiy says, 'Anyone who alters the 'coin' which was minted by the <em>hakhamiym</em> with regard to <em>berakhoth</em> does not fulfill his obligation.' Rabbi Yehudhah says, 'Anyone who changes the nature (i.e. the subject), [and in effect changes the intent of his <em>berakhah</em>] still fulfills his obligation.'\"</p>\n\n<p>These types of things are noted by Rav Sa3adyah Gaon in his prayerbook. There are a few places where he notes that he is aware of certain groups of people making additions to the wording of certain <em>berakhoth</em>; in some instances he says that although it is not in accordance with the strict requirements of the <em>halakhah</em>, it nevertheless does not damage them in fulfilling their obligation, and in other instances he notes that such changes - even minor ones - serve to change the original meaning of the <em>berakhah</em>. One such instance is on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=80\" rel=\"nofollow\">page 21-22</a>. The Gaon's language there is instructive of what has been said here.</p>\n\n<p>Further proof of this understanding of the Rambam (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Berakhoth</em>) can be seen from his explanation of the four blessings of <em>birkath ha-mazon</em> and what needs to be mentioned in order to fulfill one's obligation. Also, when explaining the <em>tashlumiyn</em> (the 'make up' for a missed prayer - cf. <em>Hilkhoth Tefiyllah</em>), the Rambam advises to make a slight addition to one of the middle <em>berakhoth</em> of the <em>shemoneh 3esrey</em> (called \"<em>hidhush davar</em>\") in order to distinguish it from one's <em>tefiyllath hovah</em>. And there are other such examples to be found in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> that are similar to this.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>rishoniym</em> and <em>aharoniym</em> who altered <em>berakhoth</em>, usually did so based on variants mentioned in the literature of <em>Hazal</em> or for kabbalistic reasons. The Arizal and other kabbalists felt that they had secret doctrines and insights that were worthy of the <em>halakhah</em> as transmitted in the Gemara being overridden. They had their reasons, but as the Rambam said: <em>eynam ela to3iym</em>. There were those, such as the Rashba, who felt that the <em>matbea3</em> only included whether or not a <em>berakhah</em> had a <em>pethihah</em> or <em>hathimah</em>, and this also contributed to later innovation. </p>\n\n<p>As for the specific examples you mentioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The fourth <em>berakhah</em> of <em>birkath ha-mazon</em> was added by <em>hakhamiym</em> with proper legal authority to do so. </p></li>\n<li><p>\"<em>she-`asani kiressono</em>\" and \"<em>ha-nothen laya'ef koah</em>\" both come from Ashkenaz and are very late additions. Even the <em>Shulhan 3Arukh</em> says not to say them because they have no basis in the <em>Talmudh</em>. The <em>rishoniym</em> - and especially the Rambam - rejected many other <em>berakhoth</em> that were created by the <em>geonim</em> for the same reason.</p></li>\n<li><p>I think you mean the <em>berakhah</em> for Yom Tov candles, which is not cited by the Rambam - which is why many Temaniym do not make a <em>berakhah</em> when lighting them.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope this has helped.</p>\n\n<p>Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n",

While soul is definitely allegoric, the heart is probably not. So why we do not wear heart part of tefillin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>this doesn't refer to tefillin but in regards to our commitment to the commandments which apply to us every day. They should be so important to us that we \"take them to heart\". The part of the shema that is the source for the mitzvah of tefillin is, \"You shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for a reminder between your eyes.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is why we have toirah shebaal peh so we don't have to invent the meaning ourselves. G-d has already told us how to interpret the commandments. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a good question and worth looking at carefully. Devarim 11:13-17 is addressing the subject of reward and punishment. Verse 11:18 begins as you say but is not talking about tefillin. The 'heart' is spelled with a double 'bet' (לבבך), as contrasted with a single 'bet'. (לבך)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שַׂמְתֶּם אֶת דְּבָרַי אֵלֶּה עַל לְבַבְכֶם וְעַל נַפְשְׁכֶם וּקְשַׁרְתֶּם אֹתָם לְאוֹת עַל יֶדְכֶם וְהָיוּ לְטוֹטָפֹת בֵּין עֵינֵיכֶם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is actually talking about the dual inclinations within each human being, the inclination for good and the inclination toward bad. We are to place these words upon our inclinations. The concept of being rewarded for good is to be placed upon our inclination for good, our 'Yetzer HaTov', in order to promote alacrity (זריזות). And the concept of punishment for bad behavior is placed upon our inclination for bad, our 'Yetzer HaRah', in order to encourage it to refrain from bad acts.</p>\n\n<p>You 'bind them', meaning your two inclinations, through these words about reward and punishment as a sign over your 'weaker hand' and your 'soul'. The 'nefesh' is referring to that aspect of soul which connects with the physical and action, the 'animating soul' and your 'hand' means your actions. And they, the concepts of reward and punishment, will be a double sign 'between your eyes, meaning over your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/66761/11501\">here</a> for details.

If it's possible to give the reasons for this, I would greatly appreciate it. </p>\n\n<p>If there is a different answer for men and women, this question deals with men. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for your help. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question has many possible answers. At different times in history, circumstances were different. And so the answer, depending on where you look could vary. But it seems most appropriate to offer the kabbalistic answer most appropriate for this time.</p>\n\n<p>This can be found from the Ba'al Shem Tov as written in Keter Shem Tov, page 3:3. It is preferred that one immerse as frequently as possible and in particular in times of need.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&st=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%94&pgnum=39&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&st=מקוה&pgnum=39&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296</a></p>\n\n<p>On page 125, chapter 219, the Ba'al Shem Tov attributes all the revelations and levels to which he attained being the result of immersion in the mikvah constantly. He emphasizes that frequent immersion (יותר בתמידות) is more beneficial than frequent fasting. He says this is because fasting weakens the physical body from being able to serve HaShem. He says that it is better to take the strength that one would lose through fasting and direct it toward increased Torah study and prayer with proper kavannah with all ones might.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&st=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%94&pgnum=161&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&st=מקוה&pgnum=161&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296</a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, on page 409, chapter 254, he emphasizes that in particular it is beneficial to immerse on erev Shabbat and Yom Tov and also on Shabbat and Yom Tov morning because it gives one 'hope' (a play on words for 'mikvah'). He says immersion at those times is a segulah for praying with kavannah and for cleaving with G-d.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&st=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%94&pgnum=443&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&st=מקוה&pgnum=443&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296</a></p>\n\n<p>In regard to the different 'spiritual effects' relating to the different times of day, these are according to some sources, like Sefer Raziel HaMalach, divided into four categories. Each of these four time periods corresponds to the predominant influence of the corresponding names of 72, 63, 45 and 52 as well as 161, 161, 143 and 151. A discussion that may answer some of your questions concerning this can be found at the section of Keter Shem Tov explaining the Kavannot for immersing in the mikvah according to the Ba'al Shem Tov. A link follows.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296&st=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%94&pgnum=41\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16081&hilite=ca15e256-b209-4975-9ab3-db97bc3ce296&st=מקוה&pgnum=41</a></p>\n\n<p>Concerning the subject of men and women, the general custom today is that women who have not yet been married do not immerse. But the reasoning behind that has nothing to do with concept here. Strictly speaking, both men and women benefit from this practice in the same way. There are some women today who immerse more frequently than once a month.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, in <em>pokeach ivrim</em> I think about thanking G-d for my capacity to see and how different would everything be if I couldn't see.</p>\n\n<p>But the first of this blessings is <em>hanoten lasechvi vina bein yom uvein laila</em> which means <em>who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night</em>. When I say this, I honestly don't know what to thank for or what to think about.

Just as God gave the rooster an understanding of the difference between day and night, we thank Him that <strong>He gave our heart the understanding that it is time to wake up and serve Him</strong> (based on Artscroll which cites the Rosh).</p>\n\n<p>The Chidushei HaRim (from <a href=\"http://www.torah.org.il/advanced/sfas-emes/5763/reeh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) explains it as a daily reminder that, just as HaShem gives the rooster the ability to distinguish between day and night, so, too, <strong>He has given us the free will necessary to choose between right and wrong</strong>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Tosfot on Talmud Brachot 60b as cited <a href=\"http://beureihatefila.com/files/Introduction_to_Birchos_Haschachar.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on p. 102, here</a>, says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He makes this blessing even if he did not hear the rooster because\nthis blessing was established to acknowledge the benefit that we\nreceive from sunlight that the rooster senses and the rooster receives\na benefit from the sunlight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, we receive the same benefit of sunlight that the rooster does. It's just that, unless we are consistent early risers, like farmers (who often arise before the rooster crows, anyway) the rooster has benefitted before us. According to this analysis, I guess that if you saw the sunlight before the rooster crowed, you could make this blessing, but, that's a separate question.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind the timing (no pun intended) of this statement. It was long before alarm clocks and smart phone and radio / CD alarms. And, I don't know how many <em>klappers</em> existed during Talmudic times. But chance are, even with a <em>klapper</em>, a rooster probably woke him up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As use to say Rebbetzin Jungreiss (Zl) the rooster is not the wiser of the animals, but he knows very well the difference between darknes and light.

He argues that had G‑d refrained from hardening\n  Pharaoh's heart, he would have then been deprived of the ability to\n  make a coherent and true choice. Indeed, the plagues would have\n  compelled him to let the Israelites go — an option he most certainly\n  would not have chosen in the absence of G‑d’s strong hand</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam on the other hand seems to say that after insisting on not letting them go, he was punished by losing his free will. Since he insisted on continuing to do evil after all the chances he was given, he could no longer do teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch actually gives a third explanation. He says that Hashem carefully <strong>limited</strong> the makos which allowed Par'o to rationalize that there was a \"power\" that Hashem could not conquer and was protecting whatever had not been affected by that particular maka. In actuality, Hashem had done this to allow the Mitzri'im to do <em>teshuvah</em> and let Bnai Yisrael go without having to totally destroy Mitzraim. An example of this is barad which destroyed the crops that were ready for harvest (spelt) but let the partially grown crops survive (wheat - since the wind cause them to bow down so the hail would not destroy them). That is why Hashem said that the crops that the hail left would be eaten by the Arbeh.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin (<em>Oznaim Latorah</em>) says that the reason it says <em>Par'o and his servants</em> is because whenever the servants started to weaken, Par'o would strengthen them. Whenever Par'o started to weaken, the servants strengthened him. The y would also remind Par'o that the previous Par'o had been deposed when he first objected to oppressing the Bnai Yisrael and only regained the throne after he agreed to enslave them (Medrash Hagadol).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hardened-hearts-some-explanations/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hardened Hearts: Some Explanations</a> gives various explanations and discusses problems with them.</p>\n\n<p>Most explanations are based on the Ramban and Rambam.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Elements of the “modest” claim are found in Moses Nachmanides’ and\n  Obadiah Sforno’s commentaries to Exodus 7:3, and in Joseph Albo’s Book\n  of Roots, IV:25. But all these philosophers put forth the modest claim\n  in the context of a wider strategy, rather than present it in\n  isolation as I have just done. And this is understandable, for the\n  approach seems to provide at best a defense against the charge of free\n  will deprivation and repentance prevention, not an explanation of why\n  God hardens. In addition, more must be said if we are to explain why\n  Pharaoh is responsible for the hardened act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to what I call “the bold claim,” Pharaoh’s act of keeping\n  the Israelites enslaved is in truth free, despite God’s intervention.\n  When God “hardens” Pharaoh’s heart, this means merely that he\n  strengthens Pharaoh’s heart, giving him the fortitude not to let the\n  plagues automatically dictate a decision to release the Israelites.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thanks to the hardening, the king now has a choice: whether to release\n  the Israelites or to keep them enslaved. Two possibilities are open to\n  him, whereas without the hardening he had but one (to release the\n  Israelites). The existence of this choice suggests he is responsible\n  for his (freely chosen) hardened act, and that he has a possibility to\n  repent. (See Albo, Book of Roots, IV:25)</p>\n  \n  <p>A different version of the bold claim runs as follows: by increasing\n  the king’s willpower (by weakening certain desires and/or\n  strengthening others), God, de facto, is allowing Pharaoh to act in\n  accordance with his already formed character, and thus to act freely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to yet another view, God hardens the agent’s heart as a\n  means of punishing him. Specifically, the hardened agent is thereby\n  deprived of three great goods: (a) free will, along with (b) the\n  potential to act rightly, and (c) the chance to repent. He is not\n  punished further for the hardened act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But even granted the heinous character of figures like Pharaoh, some\n  thinkers have been troubled by the implication that God actively shuts\n  the gates of repentance to some people. (See, for example, Arama,\n  Akedat Yitzchak, Exodus, chapter 36; cf. Maimonides, Eight Chapters,\n  Chapter 8, and Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance Chapter 6.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As a matter of fact, it seems to be a reason <strong>not</strong> to go. If Moses already knows that Pharaoh won't listen to anything he tells him, why should he go at all?

Tosafot there address some names that seem to be problematic, such as Avshalom. Tosfot Yeshanim there address the name Yishmael.</p>\n<p>Regarding the name Iyov, the poskim discuss whether one should name after someone who had bad fortune (ריע מזליה). This affects how to spell names like גדליה/גדליהו, because גדליהו בן אחיקם's life did not come to a happy end. The Rama <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%A7%D7%9B%D7%98#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.9B.D7.95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">holds</a> that the name is nevertheless spelled with a ו, and the Beit Shmuel <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that is because the Rama is not concerned about naming after people with bad fortune. The Chatam Sofer (Shu\"t EH 2:25) says that the Rama would agree that the name Akiva should be spelled with a ה at the end because of what happened to R. Akiva. Perhaps this would be a reason not to use the name איוב.</p>\n<p>In the Sefer ויקרא שמו בישראל (by R. Avraham Levi, 2015, p. 115), R.

This is too much bread per person as specified in Shemot 16:16? How do traditional sources justify the value of Omer? Shemot 16:4,8,12,15 e.t.c calls it bread for food and bread from heavens so it have to be comparable to wheat or barley.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Actually, that's not <em>that</em> far off -- about a factor of two.</p>\n\n<p>Archaeologists tell us that <a href=\"http://www.penn.museum/sites/Canaan/Bread.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an ancient Israelite ate about 330-440 pounds of wheat and barley per year</a>.  Since the Israelites in Sh'mot were active all day (nobody's sedentary in a moving camp), let's assume the upper end of that -- it might have even been somewhat higher.</p>\n\n<p>2.5 liters of barley is about 3.3 pounds and 2.5 liters of wheat is about 4 pounds (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushel\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>, plus math).  This then has to be ground for flour, porridge, and other uses, during which process there is some loss.</p>\n\n<p>The torah talks about \"bread\" (actually לֶחֶם) but it doesn't mean they went out and picked loaves of fresh-baked bread; the <em>man</em> provided ingredients.  Further, given the miraculous nature of the <em>man</em> in the first place, I don't think we need to assume that it consisted <em>only</em> of grain for bread.  I know you're not interested in rabbinic interpretations, but there is one that says the <em>man</em> took on whatever flavor the eater desired.  This could be true of form too.</p>\n\n<p>So, bottom line, if they started with about 3.5 pounds of grain-equivalent per person and turned it into food, that's not <em>too</em> far out of line for the Israelites in the wilderness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think some of the sources show a larger omer than what could be possible, too. I posted this link on another thread, but my husband and I did an extensive study in 2015 to determine what size the omer would need to be to fit all the constraints listed in the Bible, and a few more in Josephus' writings.  We considered a simulated mannah, adding oil and honey to basic grains, and getting an estimated caloric value.  Then, by using the \"average\" calories needed for men and women, we \"back-calculated\" what size the omer would need to be.</p>\n\n<p>We repeated this process for all the other constraints, such as:  recipes between the hin and omer to make the unleavened bread for the grain offerings, dedication offering for Aaron and his sons, and the firstfruit offering of yeast bread.  Also, using the size of barley grains, and the average size of fingers for the estimate of the etzba, the size of the showbread listed by Josephus, and the measurements of the table of showbread, a daily ration of water, plus more.  The final result is that an omer was somewhere between 3-4 C, with an average of 3.4 C.  This is roughly equivalent to the amount that comfortably fits into a quart canning jar, and not up to the very top.</p>\n\n<p>Please see our paper describing all the experiments and results here:\n<a href=\"http://readyanswers.org/PathfinderBibleExperience/Exodus/ConstraintsHinOmerEphah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://readyanswers.org/PathfinderBibleExperience/Exodus/ConstraintsHinOmerEphah.pdf</a>  </p>\n\n<p>The paper also discusses the hin and the ephah.</p>\n\n\n",

There are some in preceding verses too - Dvarim <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.12.15\" rel=\"nofollow\">12:15</a>-18. </p>\n\n<p>It says there what to do with blood for example but it does not say how to kill the animal. <strong><em>How is this proof of Oral Torah?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why must \"As I have Commanded you\", be interpreted as:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why Would the Participle Phrase only Modify one portion of the phrase: \"slaughter - as I have commanded you\" - rather than \"slaughter in the place ... as I have commanded you\" ... ?</li>\n<li>Why is \"commanded\" in this passage, understood to mean, \"explained\" - \"As I have already explained to you\" - rather than, \"as I have already commanded you\" ... ?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can someone provide clarification?

What is written in our tradition is long outdated. <strong><em>So, how does the peshat / plain-reading of the text suggest that it had been necessary for God to explain the exact process?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Did the Egyptians slaughter their cattle in a much different way?</p>\n\n<p>The reason why actual killing method is not stated anywhere is because we are to slaughter in most humane way possible and that changes as our technology advances. See Shemot <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">34:6</a> where it says that God is very kind, so we must be too to the animals we slaughter since we are made in the image of God.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The verses before and after 21 point out that blood can't be eaten -- it has to be spilled on the ground. They also point to which animals can be eaten. But no where in them are there any explanations of how one is to slaughter the animal. So if verse 21 says \"as I have commanded\" but the laws of slaughter are not in the written text (does one have to use a knife? how is meat prepared etc) then either the text is imperfect and referencing something non-existent, or the text is calling forth a complementary set of rules which were not written but were taught.</p>\n\n<p>Deut 17 makes reference to a written Torah. This is not to the exclusion of the necessary oral one, but because the verse discusses writing, there would be no mention of a non-written, oral set of laws. Shmot 24:12 makes reference only to the luchot, and then to a written text. Again, this doesn't preclude the oral one - check out rashi and the ramban on that verse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You are probably referring to the proof from the text that oral torah exists </p>\n\n<p>Devorim <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976#v=21&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">12.21</a>.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the place the Lord, your God, chooses to put His Name there, will be distant from you, <strong>you may slaughter of your cattle and of your sheep</strong>, which the Lord has given you, <strong>as I have commanded you,</strong> and you may eat in your cities, according to every desire of your soul..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sais <strong>as I(G-d) have commanded you(Moses),</strong> but no were in bible to we see what was commanded regarding slaughter so it must be referring to commandments that were given orally, so we see that the written Torah relied on the oral commands (Torah) for more details (not everything was written)</p>\n\n<p>Rashi there</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>you may slaughter… as I have commanded you</strong>: We learn [from here] that there is a commandment regarding slaughtering, how one must slaughter.

There is  no commandment  anywhere  in  the  Pentateuch as to  the  details  of  ritual  slaughtering  of animals or  birds, called shechitah. Hence ‘as I have commanded thee’ must  refer to another source of law: the unwritten or oral one. </p>\n\n<p>Chulin 28 a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For it has been taught: Rabbi says. The verse: And thou shalt slaughter  . . . <strong>as I have commanded thee</strong>, (8)  teaches us that Moses was instructed concerning the gullet and the windpipe; concerning the greater part of one of these organs [that must be cut] in the case of a bird, and the greater part of each in the case of cattle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(8)Deut.

The use of a head restraint will improve the accuracy of captive bolt stunning. In large beef slaughter plants without head restraint captive bolt stunning has a failure rate of 3 to 5, i.e., a second shot is required.</p>\n<p>Captive bolt and electric stunning will induce instantaneous insensibility when they are properly applied. However, improper application can result in significant stress. All stunning methods trigger a massive secretion of epinephrine (Van der Wal 1978; Warrington 1974). This outpouring of epinephrine is greater than the secretion which would be triggered by an environmental stressor or a restraint method. Since the animal is expected to be unconscious, it does not feel the stress. One can definitely conclude that improperly applied stunning methods would be much more stressful than kosher slaughter with the long straight razor sharp knife. Kilgour (1978), one of the pioneers in animal welfare research, came to a similar conclusion on stunning and slaughter .</p>\n<p>Halal (Muslim) slaughter performed with a knife that is too short causes definite distress and struggling in cattle. We recommend to those Muslim religious authorities who require slaughter without stunning that they require that the knife must be razor sharp with a straight blade that is at least twice the width of the neck. Unless the animals are stunned, the use of curved skinning knives is not acceptable. Due to the fact that Muslim slaughtermen do not usually receive as extensive special training in slaughter techniques as Jewish Shochtim, preslaughter stunning is strongly recommended. As stated earlier, reversible head-only electrical stunning is accepted by most Muslim religious authorities. Preslaughter stunning allows plants to run at higher line speeds and maintain high standards of animal welfare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>From wikipedia</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Temple Grandin has stated that she has \"<strong>observed that if the rules (of the five forbidden techniques) are disobeyed the animal will struggle. If these rules are obeyed the animal has little reaction</strong>.</p>\n<p>Studies and experiments cited on orthodox Jewish website Chabbad.org include one conducted in 1994 by Dr. Temple Grandin - an Associate Professor ofAnimal Science at Colorado and a study completed in 1992 by Dr. Flemming Bager, Head of the Danish Veterinary Laboratory, which showed that when the animals were slaughtered in a comfortable position they appeared to give no resistance and none of the animals attempted to pull away their head. <strong>The studies concluded that the animals had no pain and were not even aware that their throats were cut</strong>.</p>\n<p>Temple Grandin—a leading designer of animal handling systems—gives various research times for loss of consciousness via Kosher and Halal ritual slaughter and elaborates on what parts of the process she finds may or may not be cause for concern. Grandin observes that the way animals are handled and restrained prior to slaughter likely has a greater impact on their welfare than whether or not they are stunned. For this reason, \"under the leadership of Grandin, research into animal welfare during slaughter has shifted away from examination of different techniques of stunning to a focus on auditing the performance actual slaughter plants operating under commercial conditions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See.<br />\n<a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222248/jewish/Is-Shechita-Humane.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222248/jewish/Is-Shechita-Humane.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

Let me explain with some examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There are multiple letters for the same sound (sin and samech, vav and bet, tet and taf).</li>\n<li>There are multiple sounds for the same letter (vav can be an <em>u</em>, an <em>o</em> or a <em>v</em>).</li>\n<li>Some letters have subdivisions (shin and sin, bet and vet, etc).</li>\n<li>Just five letters have a <em>sofit</em> version.</li>\n<li>Two nikkudot can have totally different sounds but be written exactly identical (such as kamatz, that can be an <em>a</em> or an <em>o</em>).</li>\n<li>Many sounds aren't in the Hebrew alphabet (like <em>g</em> in <em>george</em>, <em>ch</em> in <em>change</em>, etc).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know every language has its rules, but how can Hebrew seem so \"un imperfect\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Many of your point are only relevant to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Modern Hebrew</a>, which is a distinct language from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Biblical Hebrew</a>, only the latter being a holy language. In fact, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vayoel_Moshe#Structure\" rel=\"noreferrer\">many orthodox Jews</a> distance themselves from Modern Hebrew (to the point of prohibiting its use in their synagogues) because of what is deemed to be its inherent un-holiness.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, let me address each of your points separately:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There are multiple letters for the same sound (sin and samech, vav and bet, tet and taf).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In fact, each letter used to have a distinct sound, but over the course of history, much of such distinction has been lost. The best preserving dialect of Hebrew is probably the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenite_Hebrew\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yemenite</a>, where there is a clear distinction between <em>waw</em>/<em>veth</em> and <em>dteth</em>/<em>taw</em>. I even heard from an authentic Yemenite source that in some Yemenite villages a distinction between <em>sin</em> and <em>samach</em> remains, the latter being about half-way between <em>sin</em> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsade#Pronunciation\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>tsadi</em></a>.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>There are multiple sounds for the same letter (vav can be an u, an o or a v).\nSome letters have subdivisions (shin and sin, bet and vet, etc).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This could be in explained in many ways. Here is a simplified <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Yetzirah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kabbalistic</a> explanation: God created the world through the <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=nW_GAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=sefirot+vowels&source=bl&ots=hF0qxMZ5J3&sig=cXUlHxlD4aOXJfEVmKGUPVt-JhY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJl4j30rPKAhUCXD4KHQHtBk4Q6AEIRTAM#v=onepage&q=sefirot%20vowels&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">10 vowels</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephirot#Yosher-Upright\" rel=\"noreferrer\">22 letters</a>. Each represents fundamental concepts and their connections. Each word consists of a collection of such concepts and connections that together form the meaning of the word. (E.g. <em>Av</em> = <em>Alef</em> + <em>Beth</em> = Master + House = Master of the house.) Some letters need to show different aspects of themselves to correctly bring out the meaning.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Just five letters have a sofit version.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to the first opinion in <em>Sanhedrin</em> (as it happens, this is the view held by archaeologists too), the Torah was originally in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Ksav Ivri</em></a> which does not have these forms. In the time of Ezra, the original script was replaced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Ksav Ashuris</em></a> which has these alternate forms. A further indication of this is that <em>Sefer Yetzira</em> (by <em>Avraham Avinu</em>) never mentions the final forms.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Two nikkudot can have totally different sounds but be written exactly identical (such as kamatz, that can be an a or an o).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is not an anomaly. Just as with the letters, each vowel also variants. Most have two length-variants. (E.g. <em>Chataf segol</em>/<em>Segol</em>, <em>Chirik katan</em>/<em>Chirik gadol</em>, <em>Shva nach</em>/<em>Shva na'</em>) Again, the distinction between many such pairs have been lost by various groups, and mostly preserved by the Yemenites.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Many sounds aren't in the Hebrew alphabet (like g in george, ch in change, etc).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>No language contains all sounds made by man. However, the ones included in Hebrew are the ones that were fundamental to the Creation. One could argue that all other sounds a made up of combinations of the 32 (including their variations) that we have. (E.g. G<sup>eorge</sup> = D + Z + Sh, Ch<sup>ange</sup> = T + Sh.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Hebrew language is considered the holy tongue, but not because it is ascetically pleasing from a grammarian's view point. It is holy because holy people use it to convey holy ideas, and it is ill suited (in its original incarnation) for speaking on profane matters. The Rambam writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have also a reason and cause for calling our language the holy language--do not think it is exaggeration or error on my part, it is perfectly correct--the Hebrew language has no special name for the organ of generation in females or in males, nor for the act of generation itself, nor for semen, nor for secretion. The Hebrew has no original expressions for these things, and only describes them in figurative language and by way of hints, as if to indicate thereby that these things should not be mentioned, and should therefore have no names; we ought to be silent about them, and when we are compelled to mention them, we must manage to employ for that purpose some suitable expressions, although these are generally used in a different sense. Moreh Nevukim 3:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

How does one behave with a King? Does one wait for him to ask? No, we try to understand what they need and give it to him.

And the Sages said this was not even half of the honor one should have for his parents. It is hard to imagine that R Tarfon's mother asked that from him. <strong>From there we see that one should indeed figure out what parents need and be ahead of them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>But there is one more level. To do what parents need even against their command. Sefer Chassidim (cited in Nishmat Avraham YD 240:4) writes that one is not obligated to listen to his sick father who was told by doctors not to eat a certain food if he asks for that food, even if he threatens not to forgive his son in this or the next world. Similarly the Schach (YD 339) writes that if a dangerously ill parent demands to be told the nature of his illness, one may not tell him. <strong>From there we see that we should do what parents <em>really need</em> even if they ask otherwise.</strong></p>\n\n<p>See more details and sources on halachot kibud av v'eim <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/12/25/kibbud-umora-av-veeim-honoring-and-fearing-ones-parents/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://halachafortodaycom.blogspot.co.il/2013/02/archives-hilchos-kibud-av-veim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> although they don't directly address your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The obligation of kibbud av ve'em is to be to your parent what your parent construed you to be when you were a child.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequently any action or feeling that as a child you would have impulsively done is a chiyuv to do for your parents otherwise you will abnegate that expectation.</p>\n\n<p>See also the Mesillas Yesharim who chooses a son performing the parent's will through a hint as the mashal for middas chassidus.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In what sense will Moshiach be \"covered\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi on Daniel 12:11 seems to represent a timeline for the approach of the Moshiach (though I admit, I don't really understand it):<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16495#showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> [translation</a> via chabad.org]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed: in order to place a silent abomination in its stead, are days of one thousand two hundred and ninety years since the daily sacrifice was removed until it will be restored in the days of our King Messiah, and this calculation coincides with the calculation of (8:14): “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred” from the day of their exile to Egypt until the final redemption: Egyptian exile 210; From their Exodus until the First Temple 480; First Temple 410; Babylonian exile 70; Second Temple 420; Totaling 1590. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of בֹּקֶר עֶרֶב [574] plus 2300 [2874].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the next verse, Rashi comments, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fortunate is he who waits etc.: Forty five years are added to the above number, for our King Messiah is destined to be hidden after he is revealed and to be revealed again. So we find in Midrash Ruth, and so did Rabbi Eleazar HaKalir establish (in the concluding poem of the morning service of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): “and he will be concealed from them six weeks of years.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven't found a citation in the midrash to Ruth, nor have I looked up Yotzer Parshat Hachodesh, but I am trying to understand the idea that the Moshiach will be revealed and then hidden and revealed (for 45 years? For 42 years?). Can anyone point me to discussions of this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is the traditional teaching from the time of the Rishonim of how the final redemption will unfold.

It is classically considered to be a time of refinement and 'testing the faith' of the Jewish people like is discussed by Saadia Gaon in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31359&st=&pgnum=179\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Emunot v'Deot, Ma'amar 8, Chapter 5</a> and also by Rabbi Meir Aldabi in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43517&st=&pgnum=149\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Shevilei Emunah, Nativ 10, Chapter 1</a>. They see the one who was believed to be Moshiach die and become disheartened as a result. Some lose their faith. Some don't. It is to a large degree dependent on their eating \"salted foods\". That means that they continue to learn faithfully the Torah that has been preserved for the Jewish people up until that time.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of this time period the beginning of the period of resurrection starts. This time period begins with the resurrection of the 7 Shepherds and 8 anointed individuals listed in Sukkah 52b.</p>\n\n\n",

Here is how some poskim have applied these guidelines (sources <a href=\"http://www.kosherveyosher.com/smoking-tobacco-1084.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dafdigest.org/BavaMetzia/Bava%20Metzia%20112.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>R Moshe Tendler</strong> (Beit Yitzchak 15:71) explains this Gemara as teaching that the Halacha defines the parameters of acceptable risky activities by <strong>what the members of a society accept as reasonable</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>R Chaim Ozer Grodzinsky</strong> (Teshuvot Achiezer 1:23) applies this guideline <strong>only when the danger is minimal and disaster rarely occurs</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>R Yaakov Ettlinger</strong> (Teshuvot Binyan Tzion 1:137, 19th century) explores the permissibility of embarking on a sea voyage or a journey across a desert. He distinguishes between an immediate danger and a long-term danger. <strong>Immediate danger is prohibited in all situations. Future danger may be ignored if it can reasonably be expected to cause no harm.</strong> It is likely that such risk is tolerated only if for the purpose of earning a living or other great need.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Noda B’Yehuda</strong> (II, Y.D. 10) rules that <strong>a person who is needy may enter into a situation of danger if it is necessary as part of his efforts to earn a living</strong>. However, anyone who acts irresponsibly and suspends himself from trees or engages in risky behavior needlessly is in violation of the Torah’s directive “Be exceedingly careful to guard your lives\"</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Chazon Ish</strong> writes that it does not seem that this Gemara\nis offering any extension to permit entering into danger.\nRather, the Gemara is dealing with a case of climbing on a tree\nor crossing a ramp. These behaviors are potentially dangerous,\nbut when a person does them he usually does so cautiously\nand with protecting himself with taking proper safety measures.\nThis is true whether the person is involved in earning a\nliving or not. <strong>The reason this is permitted is that when a person\nproceeds carefully, the risk of danger is limited.</strong> This is\npermitted for anyone who acts in this manner, but <strong>outright\nplacing oneself in dangerous conditions remain prohibited</strong>. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is how <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/be/48880977.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daniel Eisenberg at Aish</a> summarizes it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Talmud asks in several places why certain potentially dangerous\n  actions are permitted. It answers that a person need not avoid small\n  risks that are accepted by the rest of normal society without undue\n  concern.</p>\n  \n  <p>For instance, since automobile travel\n  presents an element of danger, we might think that it should be\n  forbidden. Nevertheless, it is a risk accepted by society and most\n  people do not give much thought to the danger. Therefore, driving with\n  normal caution (such as wearing a seatbelt and using the turn signal)\n  is permitted by Jewish law, despite the inherent small risk.</p>\n  \n  <p>The rationale for this ruling is that while we may not take\n  indiscriminate risks, we may go about normal activities of daily\n  living with the guarantee of heavenly protection. This is derived from\n  the book of Psalms that states: \"God watches over the simple.\" That\n  is, I do not have to worry when I go outside that I may be the one in\n  a million to be struck by lightning. Because I can rely on the promise\n  that God watches over me -- as I do the simple activities of daily\n  living.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy\" rel=\"nofollow\">here under “Preparations and treatment”</a>. Therefore if the person believes that a homeopathic medicine will help him, he may come to the issur and therefore the  decree/gezeiro should remain in place. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R Meir (Shabbos 67a) permits wearing a fox's tooth on Shabbos as a sleep aid. The Rambam (Hil' Shabbos 19:13) rules like Rav Meir.</p>\n\n<p>Chullin 77b discusses whether such \"cures\" would qualify as adopting foreign customs, derekh Emori, and thus prohibited. The Ran (ad loc) explains that  anything that healed three times is considered a verified cure. (A statement we find Chazal make about amulet writers on Shabbos 61b.) We do not need to have an explanatory theory.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam says similar in the Guide to the Perplexed 3:37. I normally would not assume something written in the Guide is halachic, but since it matches the Ran's position, I think it's the most likely explanation of his ruling in his code.</p>\n\n<p>One bit about the Rambam, though, he permits the cures because \"they were thought to be effective.\" In other words, placebo effect would be considered sufficient reason to permit a cure. (See also his commentary on mishnah, Yuma 8:6.)</p>\n\n<p>So, you end up with two questions:</p>\n\n<p>1- Now that science has developed more certain validation of therapies, would Chazal still use the \"worked three times\" criterion? In other words, is this criterion an actual halachic statement, or were they just giving the best validation system then known?</p>\n\n<p>This question is actually still under dispute. (See Nishmas Avraham vol 4 OC 306 who follows R SZ Aurbach requiring double-blind testing, but he does cite both sides.)</p>\n\n<p>2- A more pragmatic question: If we do still use the \"worked three times\" criterion, does the \"treatment\" in question actually qualify? (I am taking it for granted that if it actually passed a double-blind statistical test, it wouldn't still be labeled \"alternative medicine\".)</p>\n\n\n",

Everyone (even non-Jews) I talk to says beards grow faster if you shave them, but I'm not sure what the average Orthodox Jewish teen does. Does he ever shave during his teenage years? Or do you leave it alone and wait for a while and have it grow out normally and slowly like I'm doing now.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In my experience, different communities have different practices with regard to shaving. (Note that when I talk about \"shaving\" in this answer, I mean cutting the beard with a permitted shaving device. Not a straight razor which is forbidden.)</p>\n\n<p>In general, Hasidic Jews (including teenagers) tend not to shave at all. My understanding is that this is for <em>kabbalistic</em> reasons. The result is that teenagers often have kind of scraggly beard. In more \"<em>litvish</em>\" communities, on the other hand, my experience is that married adult men tend to have beards (either trimmed or long) while unmarried yeshiva <em>bochurim</em> tend to shave regularly. I think this is more an instance of fitting in with community norms rather than based on any particular <em>halachic</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> reasoning (and this practice is less universal among <em>litvish</em> Jews than the practice of not shaving is among <em>hasidic</em> Jews). By the time a man reaches marriage age, his beard usually grows in much thicker and more evenly than that of a teenager.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, your premise that hair grows faster after shaving <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/hairgrow.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">is not true</a>. This is a mistaken belief likely originating from the fact that recently shaved hair tends to feel thicker than hair that has been allowed to grow. From that article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hair expert Philip Kingsley recommends thinking of a bamboo cane: a long cane flexes easily, but the same cane cut short feels harder and tougher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if your goal is to grow a beard, shaving it isn't going to make it happen any faster.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>From my experience living my whole life with Orthodox Jews </p>\n\n<p>A lot of Orthodox Jewish teens always \"shave\" (without a razor) except for days it is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>The ones that do grow a full beard usually do not shave (they consider it forbidden).</p>\n\n<p>But recently modern style is starting/returning to be adopted so we see more trimmed beards. Orthodox Jewish teens that adopt this style start trimming before their beard grows large.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You are probably not a judge that you need a big beard for people to respect you, people can respect you for who you are.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Baba Sali davened his whole life he should have a better beard growth.</p>\n\n<p>The beard of the Besht used to part into 15 when he said yishtabach corresponding to the 15 shvachim.</p>\n\n<p>You can't enhance your beard's spirituality by shaving it.</p>\n\n\n",

Is anyone aware of any heterim for this? (eg. for inviting people in the process of conversion)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In siman 512 the allowance given by the Mechaber is to cook for one's servant maid etc or a no-Jew who comes himself. </p>\n\n<p>Mishna Berurah explains that the only time we have the concern of coming to cook specifically for a non-Jew is when they were important enough to invite. In that case we are afraid one may accidentally come to cook specifically for them which is a biblical prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>Ramma adds that when cooking for himself, he can actually add extra food for the non-jew. This is only written about the non-Jew the Mechaber was talking about, a servant or maid. However this allowance does not extend to other non-jews. \nFrom the Aruch HaShulchan siff 6 it appears a person who shows up by himself would be included in the prohibited group.</p>\n\n<p>Also in the Aruch HaShulchan siff 5 he brings another hetter to invite a non-Jew as long as the food was already cooked. The Aruch HaShulchan though goes on to explain that the situation cannot be that one had intended to invite him from before he started cooking. It would be impossible to say he didn't have this guest in mind when cooking. He says this only works if one cooked the food, and then bumped into this non-Jew close to meal time, and invited him to the completely ready meal.</p>\n\n<p>One clarification though, you mention heating up food in your question. I would doubt heating up food that was previously cooked is included in this Rabbinic enactment. But clear that up with your religious authority.</p>\n\n\n",

(I spoke to an eye-witness of those notes, who saw them when <a href=\"http://www.kestenbaum.net/hi_0608.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RSRH's Zohar was auctioned off in 2008</a>.)</p>\n<p>The difference is that to Rav Hirsch, the Zohar speaks in metaphor, not of metaphysical ontologies.</p>\n<p>The Nefesh haChaim, to pick one example, (sec. 1) takes mitzvos as realigning the physical forces of the world with loftier metaphysical ones, (sec. 2) prayer as drawing down holiness to the world, and (sec. 3) learning as a means of bringing Hashem's presence to the studier, and thereby into the world. to him, the acts actually move around qabbalistic \"things\". To R' Hirsch, all of this is to change one's attitude toward the world by manipulating representations, symbols, of loftier ideas.</p>\n<p>The Ramchal, as he explains in the beginning of Qela\"ch Pichei Chokhmah, also saw the Zohar and the Ari's Qabbalah as speaking in a symbol system.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I left the Rambam out of that comparison because I believe that his system of explaining mitzvos does not speak to us anyway. It contradicts Qabbalah, Chassidus, Mussar, Rav Hirsch, etc... Now to justify that seemingly bold claim:</p>\n<p>According to the Rambam, redemption lays in theological knowledge; not knowledge <strong>of</strong> G-d, which he believes is impossible, but knowledge <strong>about</strong> G-d, the philosopher's sort. (See last chapter of Moreh Nevuchim; his words are translated: \"דעות אמיתיות באלוהיות\" -ibn Tibon, \"השקפות אמיתיות בעניני האלוהיים\" -el Qafih [\"Kapach\"], \"דעות אמיתיות במטפיזיקה\" -Schwartz, \"true metaphysical opinions as regards God\" -Fraedlander)</p>\n<p>It is this knowledge which gives prophets their prophecy (2:12) and earns one individualized Divine Providence (3:18) and to be truly called a person (idid & 3:54) This return from emotion and moral calling to intellectual clarity is undoing the effects of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (1:1-2). Moral decision-making is less significant than determining Truth. (ibid, 3:54 -- ie the Moreh opens and closes with it.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Rambam sees all of the mitzvos as serving one of three goals (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp163.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:27, tr. Fraedlander</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THE general object of the Law is twofold: the well-being of the soul, and the well-being of the body. The well-being of the soul is promoted by correct opinions communicated to the people according to their capacity. Some of these opinions are therefore imparted in a plain form, others allegorically: because certain opinions are in their plain form too strong for the capacity of the common people. The well-being of the body is established by a proper management of the relations in which we live one to another. This we can attain in two ways: first by removing all violence from our midst: that is to say, that we do not do every one as he pleases, desires, and is able to do; but every one of us does that which contributes towards the common welfare. Secondly, by teaching every one of us such good morals as must produce a good social state. Of these two objects, the one, the well-being of the soul, or the communication of correct opinions, comes undoubtedly first in rank, but the other, the well-being of the body, the government of the state, and the establishment of the best possible relations among men, is anterior in nature and time. The latter object is required first; it is also treated [in the Law] most carefully and most minutely, because the well-being of the soul can only be obtained after that of the body has been secured.\n... The second perfection of man consists in his becoming an actually intelligent being; i.e., he knows about the things in existence all that a person perfectly developed is capable of knowing. This second perfection certainly does not include any action or good conduct, but only knowledge, which is arrived at by speculation, or established by research.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the second and superior kind of perfection can only be attained when the first perfection has been acquired; for a person that is suffering from great hunger, thirst, heat, or cold, cannot grasp an idea even if communicated by others, much less can he arrive at it by his own reasoning. But when a person is in possession of the first perfection, then he may possibly acquire the second perfection, which is undoubtedly of a superior kind, and is alone the source of eternal life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also I would note that the Rambam says that ta'amei hamitzvos can only be explored about the big picture. He writes (3:26):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of us, the common people as well as the scholars, believe that there is a reason for every precept, although there are commandments the reason of which is unknown to us, and in which the ways of God's wisdom are incomprehensible. ... The repeated assertion of our Sages that there are reasons for all commandments, and the tradition that Solomon knew them, refer to the general purpose of the commandments, and not to the object of every detail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those who trouble themselves to find a cause for any of these detailed rules, are in my eyes void of sense: they do not remove any difficulties, but rather increase them. ... You ask why must a lamb be sacrificed and not a ram? but the same question would be asked, why a ram had been commanded instead of a lamb, so long as one particular kind is required. The same is to be said as to the question why were seven lambs sacrificed and not eight; the same question might have been asked if there were eight, ten, or twenty lambs, so long as some definite number of lambs were sacrificed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This focus on intellect, reducing character (middos, ethical behavior, etc...) to its handmaiden was the topic of major condemnation by many in consequent generations. Rav Hirsch cites the Rambam's inability to apply his philosophy to such details as a symptom of the Rambam's whole system being off. To quote the 19 Letters of Ben Uzziel (Letter 18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The age gave birth to a man [R’ Drachman’s footnote: Maimonides], a mind, who, the product of uncomprehended Judaism and Arabic science, was obliged to reconcile the strife which raged in his own breast in his own manner, and who, by proclaiming it to the world, became the guide of all in whom the same conflict existed.</p>\n<p>This great man to whom, and to whom alone, we owe the preservation of practical Judaism to our time, is responsible because he sought to reconcile Judaism with the difficulties which confronted it from without instead of developing it creatively from within, for all the good and the evil which bless and afflict the heritage of the father. His peculiar mental tendency was Arabic-Greek, and his conception of the purpose of life the same. He entered into Judaism from without, bringing with him opinions of whose truth he had convinced himself from extraneous sources and he reconciled. For him, too, self-perfecting through the knowledge of truth was the highest aim, the practical he deemed subordinate. For him knowledge of God was the end, not the means; hence he devoted his intellectual powers to speculations upon the essence of Deity, and sought to bind Judaism to the results of his speculative investigations as to postulates of science or faith. The Mizvoth became for him merely ladders, necessary only to conduct to knowledge or to protect against error, this latter often only the temporary and limited error of polytheism. Mishpatim became only rules of prudence, Mitzvoth as well; Chukkim rules of health, teaching right feeling, defending against the transitory errors of the time; Edoth ordinances, designed to promote philosophical concepts; all this having no foundation in the eternal essence of things, not resulting from their eternal demand on me, or from my eternal purpose and task, no eternal symbolizing of an unchangeable idea, and not inclusive enough to form a basis for the totality of the commandments.</p>\n<p>He, the great systematic orderer of the practical results of the Talmud, gives expression in the last part of his philosophic work to opinions concerning tlie meaning and purpose of the commandments which, taking the very practical results codified by himself as the contents of the commandments, are utterly untenable cast no real light upon them and cannot go hand in hand with them in practice, in life, and in science…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What then is RSRH’s complaint? That the Rambam was too Aristotelian, and it led him to study Judaism from the outside, casting upon it the Hellenic philosopher’s priority of knowledge rather than morality.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to answer the Rambam part of the question... Yes, the Rambam and Qabbalah's explanation of mitzvos contradict, but most of us would be demanding the burden of proof from the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your conception, that the two schools of thought you enumerate (if you can call it that) are at odds with each other is not accurate.</p>\n<p>Both the written Torah and its complete explanation, meaning all parts of the oral Torah, were given to Moshe at Sinai.</p>\n<p>In the Mechilta on Yitro, Rabbi Akiva says the entire Torah (everything that is contained in both the written and oral) was said in a single word by HaShem directly to Israel. This concept, although stated extremely briefly, is to emphasize that the Torah is one (תורה אחת).</p>\n<p>We repeat this every Shabbat when we say the Lecha Dodi prayer which states, \"Shamor v'zachor b'dibur echod hishmi'anu E-l hameyuchad. HaShem echod u'shemo echod l'shem, u'letiferet v'litehillah.\" As the Vilna Gaon teaches, the Torah is G-d's name. (See Sefer Orot HaGra, section on Torah at the beginning for details.)</p>\n<p>This same concept is repeated with more detail by Rabbi Akiva's student, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (the Rashbi) to his son, Rabbi Eliezer in the Zohar, Section 3, 73a which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וע\"ד ישראל בתרין דרגין אינון סתים וגליא דתנינן ג' דרגין אינון מתקשרן דא בדא קב\"ה אורייתא וישראל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%94%D7%A8_%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%92_%D7%A2%D7%92_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/זהר_חלק_ג_עג_א</a></p>\n<p>That aspect of the Torah that appears divided relates only to the lower aspect of each Jew,  the Yaacov aspect of their soul. But the true, revealed unity of the whole Torah is what corresponds to the aspect of Yisroel within each Jew. And like the Rashbi emphasizes in this Zohar cited, the Torah informs us explicitly in Bereshit 32:29,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יקרא שמך עוד יעקב וגו'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your name will no longer be called Yaacov, rather, we are to be called Yisrael.</p>\n<p>The Holy One One, blessed be He, the Torah and Yisrael are all one, bound together. The hidden and revealed are all one. The unity of the Torah is a manifestation of G-d's unity, His oneness. So too, the unity of the Jewish people, that we are \"Am echod b'aretz\" is a manifestation of G-d's unity.</p>\n<p>Ultimately this will be revealed in the entire universe like it states at the end of the second paragraph of the Aleinu prayer, \"On that day, G-d will be one and his name one.\" We help to bring about this manifestation by learning the whole Torah, all its various aspects and revealing its unity. Not, G-d forbid, the opposite.</p>\n<p>This same teaching is also repeated by Rav Sherira Gaon near the beginning of his famous letter beginning with the words, \"דהא תנו רבנן בפרק יש נוחלין כו״\". Rav Sherira emphasizes how even the least among the students of Rabbi Hillel HaZaken knew virtually all areas of the Torah, both the revealed and the hidden, including Ma'aseh Merkava (the great matter) and Ma'aseh Bereshit (the small matter - according to some 'the small matter' refers to the discussions between Abaye and Rava). Nothing was an innovation, not even the discussions of Abaye and Rava. It all came ultimately from Moshe Rabbeinu at Har Sinai and Yehoshuah after him, in Rav Sherirah Gaon's words, \"from earlier Sages\".</p>\n<p>And Rav Sherira goes on to point out that up until Hillel and Shammai, the entire Torah, meaning the revealed and hidden parts of the Torah, Niglah and Nistar, was viewed as completely consistent without conflict or disagreement, with the sole exception of the 'semicha controversy.' (Remember that after Moshe died, Yehoshuah forgot hundreds of halachot and had to work to recover them.) Sherira Gaon explains that disagreements and argument only grew out of a lack of sufficient study. As the level of study decreased, like with the <em><strong>students</strong></em> of Hillel and Shammai, it appeared that the Torah was more divided and inconsistent. But that is only the result of the immature understanding of the students.</p>\n<p>This same teaching, that the Holy One One, blessed be He, the Torah and Yisrael are all one is repeated by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in his commentary to Idra Rabba. It is also found in the introduction to Sefer Pi Chocham by Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kab.co.il/heb/content/view/frame/3849?/heb/content/view/full/3849&main\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.kab.co.il/heb/content/view/frame/3849?/heb/content/view/full/3849&main</a></p>\n<p>It is a consistent teaching, generation after generation by all the gedolei Yisrael going back to Moshe Rabbeinu at Har Sinai.</p>\n<p>Concerning the question about \"What is the Kabbalistic view in regard to Ta'amei HaMitzvot?\", it is far too broad a subject to address in a few paragraphs on this forum.</p>\n<p>A very good book that addresses this subject in systematic way is Sefer Shomer Emunim by Rabbi Yosef ben Emmanuel Ergas. Rabbi Ergas was dealing with the fallout from Shabbtai Tzvi and wrote this book to make clear the authentic roots of genuine Kabbalah. For anyone trying to understand this subject, Shomer Emunim is a very good introduction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39500&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39500&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Kabbalistically, the levels of atzilus, beriah, yetzirah and asiyah exist in all levels of abi'a.</p>\n\n<p>I.e. there are levels even in asiyah that are impenetrable to us.</p>\n\n<p>So the Rambam is asiyah she'beasiyah looking towards atzilus she'beasiyah.

There are Nackedness and derivatives,  excrements and equivalents. The Rashba explains in Masechet Berachot (25a, {1})  that from the details of the verses result differences in halacha regarding those two different prohibitions. One example is when they are behind a transparent glass. If nackedness is behind a transparent glass separation,  the prohibition remains because Tora points the vision. But for excrements you can see, if you are separated by a close glass and there is no odors,  you can pray and  bless because you are in a separated area (והיה מחנך קדוש).  If there is no separation and you can see the stools, even far, you are considered in the same area and cannot pray. To cover the excrements makes a separation (וכיסית את צאתך).  If you want to praise niflaot haberia thinking to elimination process,  no problem. </p>\n\n<p>For nackedness there is a problem of thinking. which is bad as another verse says to avoid all bad things. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>are there any sources that discuss what an appropriate kavanah should be?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kavana of the blessing is not so close to defecation and urination. Shulchan Aruch OC in Siman 6 sayf 1 explained the Kavana: That the creation of man displays a wonderful wisdom. Some commentators say that the blessing regards the fact that the body is similar to a bota bag air-filled, and full of holes. Some others comments, \"by wisdom\" that G-d did prepare the foods of Adam, and then he created him, with holes, the mouth, the nose, anus, and hollow organs as hearth, stomach, etc, see below the SA:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשיצא מבית הכסא יברך \"אשר יצר את האדם בחכמה\", שבריאת האדם היא בחכמה נפלאה. ויש מפרשים, על שם שהגוף דומה לנוד מלא רוח, והוא מלא נקבים, כדלקמן בסמוך. ויש מפרשים \"בחכמה\", שהתקין מזונותיו של אדם הראשון ואחר כך בראו.‏\n   \"וברא בו נקבים נקבים, חלולים חלולים\", פירוש: נקבים רבים, כגון פה וחוטם ופי טבעת, וגם ברא בו איברים רבים חלולים, כמו לב וכרס ומעיים. ‏\n   \"שאם יסתם אחד מהם\", כלומר שבנקבים יש נקב אחד, שהוא הפה, שכשהוא במעי אמו הוא סתום, וכשיוצא לאויר העולם הוא נפתח. ואם כשיוצא לאויר העולם היה נשאר סתום, לא היה אפשר להתקיים אפילו שעה אחת. והאיברים החלולים, אם היה נפתח אחד מהם – לא היה אפשר להתקיים אפילו שעה אחת.‏\n  ועוד יש לפרש, שגבול יש לאדם שיכולין נקביו ליסתם ולא ימות, וכיון שעבר אותו הגבול – אי אפשר להתקיים אפילו שעה אחת. וכיוון שבכלל הנקבים הם פי הטבעת ופי האמה, ובכלל האיברים החלולים – שאם יפתח אחד מהם אי אפשר להתקיים – הם כרס ומעיים, שפיר הוי שבח זה מעניין עשיית צרכיו.‏\n  ואפשר עוד, שמאחר שאם יוצא לנקביו ביותר עד שאם עבר הגבול – ימות, בכלל \"שאם יפתח אחד מהם\" הוא, והוי \"שאם יפתח אחד מהם\" נמי מענין עשיית צרכיו ממש.‏\n   \"רופא [חולי] כל בשר\", על שם שהנקבים שברא בו להוציא פסולת מאכלו, כי אם יתעפש בבטן – ימות, והוצאתו היא רפואה.‏\n   \"ומפליא לעשות\", מפני שהאדם דומה לנוד מלא רוח, ואם יעשה אדם בנוד נקב כחודה של מחט, הרוח יוצא. והאדם מלא נקבים ורוחו משתמרת בתוכו, הרי זה פלא.‏\n  ועוד יש לפרש, על שם שבורר טוב המאכל ודוחה הפסולת. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The blessing of asher yatsar is about  the healthy well-being reached after urination and defection. If the urinary tract or the GE system were not well it was not possible to live. the issue is not to recall the defection. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>{1} </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דהא לגבי צואה לא הקפידה תורה אלא במחניך קדוש וכל שהוא חוץ לד' אמותיו אינה במחנהו, ומנחנהו קדוש הוא? ואי משום לא יראה בך -- ההוא בערוה ממש מוקמינן לה וכדאמרינן לקמן (כה:) צואה בעששית מותר לקרות ק\"ש כנגדה. ערוה בעששית אסור לקרות ק\"ש כנגדה. מאי טעמא צואה בכיסוי תליא מילתא דכתיב \"ושבת וכסית את צאתך\" אבל ערוה \"לא יראה בך ערות דבר\" אמר רחמנא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They all must be agreed to in order to purchase the product legally. There are also follow up warnings of those agreements and conditions that come with the actual product and are often in the opening or closing credits of the DVDs.</p>\n\n<p>See the following examples from Beachbody, the owners of P90X and many other fitness products.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.beachbody.com/product/about_us/terms_and_conditions.do\">https://www.beachbody.com/product/about_us/terms_and_conditions.do</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.beachbody.com/product/about_us/terms_of_use.do\">https://www.beachbody.com/product/about_us/terms_of_use.do</a></p>\n\n<p>As with any legal contract (terms of agreement and acquisition through 'kinyan') between two parties, you would be required according to halacha to honor the terms of the agreement you entered into because you have formed a type of partnership.

    "title": "\"ויחזק\" Vs \"ויכבד\"",
    "content": "# \"ויחזק\" Vs \"ויכבד\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Throughout Parshat Vaeira, Bo, and Beshalach, these two phrases are interchangeably employed. Either Pharoah's heart is \"strengthened\"- \"החזיק\", or \"heavy\"- \"כבד\" (obviously these are loose translations). Not only is it in reference to just Pharoah, but these terms/shorashim are used in reference to many other things, from Mitzrayim itself (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0214.htm#17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmot 14:17</a>) to the very wheels of their chariots (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0214.htm#25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:25</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, all of the Mefarshim in their commentaries use these terms interchangeably, never implying any underlying meaning as to the usage of one over the other. </p>\n\n<p>What is the message here? These words are placed seemingly randomly, and could easily be switched out for the other in most contexts- what is each coming to teach? What's the underlying point here? Any ideas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>My favorite commentator when it comes to understanding the differences of meanings between words (that may seem like synonyms) is the Malbim. He has some wonderful and minute distinctions between such pairs, and he holds to them throughout his commentary on the Tanach. These small differences can open a wide world of new understandings.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, he does speak of the difference between this pair as well (though very shortly and not in-depth, as opposed to many other cases). In chapter 8, 11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.ויש הבדל בין הכביד לבו ובין חזק לב, שר\"ל שהיה ירא ומלא פחד ובכ\"ז הכביד לבו שלא לשלח ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then a bit later in chapter 9, 34:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.ותחילה הכביד לבו והיה מפחד קצת, ואח\"כ ויחזק לבו כי כפר בכל ולא שלח את ב\"י ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that \"חזק\" is stronger, it is the advanced mode of just \"כבד\". The first part says that he was afraid, but even so he forcefully made his heart \"heavy\". And in the second part, again, he first made his heart \"heavy\", but he was still afraid. Then he \"strengthened\" his heart and made his final decision.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, here's a <a href=\"http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=11723\">short article in Hebrew</a> that reviews the usage of \"חזק\" and \"כבד\" as well, but does not speak explicitly about the differences between them (he does mention a source for further reading about this difference, in Rabbi Mordechai Breuer's book Pirkei Moadot, but I couldn't find an online copy).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A possible way to understand the different usage is to look to the Targum Onkelos.</p>\n<p>In the examples you cite, Shemot 14:17 and Shemot 14:25:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַאֲנִ֗י הִנְנִ֤י מְחַזֵּק֙ אֶת־לֵ֣ב מִצְרַ֔יִם וְיָבֹ֖אוּ אַחֲרֵיהֶ֑ם וְאִכָּבְדָ֤ה בְּפַרְעֹה֙ וּבְכָל־חֵיל֔וֹ בְּרִכְבּ֖וֹ וּבְפָרָשָֽׁיו׃</p>\n<p>וַיָּ֗סַר אֵ֚ת אֹפַ֣ן מַרְכְּבֹתָ֔יו וַֽיְנַהֲגֵ֖הוּ בִּכְבֵדֻ֑ת וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מִצְרַ֗יִם אָנ֙וּסָה֙ מִפְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל כִּ֣י יְהוָ֔ה נִלְחָ֥ם לָהֶ֖ם בְּמִצְרָֽיִם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first 'מחזק' is a verb and has a targum of 'מתקף'. Jastrow gives a translation of: to overpower, or seize, or to make irascible or vehement. So in the context of effecting Pharoah's heart, it means changing his natural emotional state at the time.</p>\n<p>The 'ואכבדה' in the same line is also a verb and has a targum of 'ואתיקר' which means according to Jastrow to make heavy. This was being done to the chariots and the horses of the cavalry.</p>\n<p>In verse 14:25 the 'בכבדת' is a noun and has a targum of 'בתקוף' which Jastrow translates as force or power. So in context, the binding of the wheel of his chariots was done through the force (of gravity) making them heavier than normal or frictional resistance from the mud binding them from moving or possibly both.</p>\n<p>The posuk mentioned above, Shemot 8:11 has a much different message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּ֣רְא פַּרְעֹ֗ה כִּ֤י הָֽיְתָה֙ הָֽרְוָחָ֔ה וְהַכְבֵּד֙ אֶת־לִבּ֔וֹ וְלֹ֥א שָׁמַ֖ע אֲלֵהֶ֑ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This mentions that Pharaoh saw 'הרוחה' and in consequence made himself heavy hearted (melancholy, a pensive sadness). The key to understanding this usage relates to the 'רוחה'. The Targum says that this relates to the open space at court where counsel was taken. In other words, Pharaoh took counsel about the frog situation but didn't listen to his counselors.</p>\n<p>What was the 'frog' situation? For this it is necessary to look at Shemot 8:5-10.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֣ה לְפַרְעֹה֮ הִתְפָּאֵ֣ר עָלַי֒ לְמָתַ֣י ׀ אַעְתִּ֣יר לְךָ֗ וְלַעֲבָדֶ֙יךָ֙ וּֽלְעַמְּךָ֔ לְהַכְרִית֙\nהַֽצֲפַרְדְּעִ֔ים מִמְּךָ֖ וּמִבָּתֶּ֑יךָ רַ֥ק בַּיְאֹ֖ר תִּשָּׁאַֽרְנָה׃ וַיֹּ֖אמֶר לְמָחָ֑ר וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ כִּדְבָ֣רְךָ֔ גו״</p>\n<p>וְסָר֣וּ הַֽצְפַרְדְּעִ֗ים מִמְּךָ֙ וּמִבָּ֣תֶּ֔יךָ וּמֵעֲבָדֶ֖יךָ וּמֵעַמֶּ֑ךָ רַ֥ק בַּיְאֹ֖ר תִּשָּׁאַֽרְנָה׃</p>\n<p>וַיַּ֥עַשׂ ה״ כִּדְבַ֣ר מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַיָּמֻ֙תוּ֙ הַֽצְפַרְדְּעִ֔ים מִן־הַבָּתִּ֥ים מִן־הַחֲצֵרֹ֖ת וּמִן־הַשָּׂדֹֽת׃</p>\n<p>וַיִּצְבְּר֥וּ אֹתָ֖ם חֳמָרִ֣ם חֳמָרִ֑ם וַתִּבְאַ֖שׁ הָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe had proposed to Pharaoh that the frogs would be removed from you, your servants, your houses, your people...<em><strong>and only remain in the river</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>But what happened was the dead carcasses remained all over Egypt and rotted and stank. This was why Pharaoh took counsel. It seemed to him like the deal was not kept. But the Torah emphasizes that HaShem did exactly as Moshe had asked. This has an implication about what Moshe prayed for. That what Moshe presented to Pharaoh and what Moshe prayed for were not exactly the same. And this created doubt for Pharaoh.</p>\n<p>What this is indicating is the specific name which Moshe was using in his prayers. This same name is what caused the staff of Moshe to change into  a serpent and then back again. This theme is repeated throughout the entire story of the Exodus. Like for example, in the plague of darkness which was upon Egypt, for the Jews there was light. And this is the name of G-d that Pharaoh didn't know.</p>\n<p>A similar thing happened in the account of Shemot 9:28-35. Pharaoh asked for the thunder and hail to stop. But what he received as a consequence of Moshe's prayer was that in addition to the thunder and hail stopping, the rain also stopped falling on Mitzrayim.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of not receiving what he had bargained for, he once again became pensive and after reflecting became irascible and vehement that he would not send the Jewish people as he had said.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Far from a complete answer but perhaps \"heavy\" is not the best translation contextually of כבד which suggests instead more Pharaoh's incredible hubris (כבוד). That root seems to only appear in the initial stages of the confrontations, when direct divine intervention was not yet as necessary in order to incite his arrogant stubbornness. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EMkvW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EMkvW.png\" alt=\"Pharaoh's Hardening Heart Chart\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

Thus, each millenium in the existence of the world is the equivalent of a \"day\" of creation, with the seventh millennium (6001 - 7000) being the equivalent Shabbat. Since the year 6000 is the last year of \"Erve Shabbat\", the mashiach would have to come then for the \"spiritual\" millennium to begin. An example of this is found at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/607585/jewish/Significance-of-the-year-6000.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">What is the significance of the year 6000 in the Jewish calendar?</a> Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashana 31a and Sanhedrin 97a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Talmud tells us that this world, as we know it, will last for six\n  thousand years, with the seventh millennium ushering in the cosmic\n  Shabbat, the Messianic Era.

Right now, we are in the year 5769,\n  which means it's Erev Shabbos of the world. By the year 6,000,\n  Mashiach has to be here. He could come much earlier. But by the year\n  6,000, he has to be here. … the Vilna Gaon said that the last war,\n  Milchemet Gog uMagog, is going to last only 12 minutes because they\n  are going to have such weapons….

Sanhedrin 97a</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should be noted that this only one of a few theories given in the same part of the Talmud, but this seems to be the one most widely believed. Note the strong parallels between the Jewish conception of the week and the Jewish conception of Time.

    "content": "# Where is the source for assigning a pasuk to each year since creation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember having been told that there are those who assign each of the 5845 pesukim in the Torah to each year since creation. This is from memory as I have not found the reference yet. Would anyone have a reference that talks about this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @Loewian who found <a href=\"http://torahweek.blogspot.com/2012/12/missing-pesukim.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Missing Pesukim</a> which gives counts. However I found some places in this post where a 1 is shown as an 8 (108 vs 101 for Tetzaveh and 118 vs 111  for Vayikra) based on what is printed at the end of the parsha in Art Scroll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I finally managed to go through the Art Scroll Chumash with the <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2016/01/count-of-pesukim-in-each-parsha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parsha counts</a>. However, the totals at the end of the Chumash for each sefer do not match up with the totals calculated from the list at the end of each Parsha or from counting the verses printed, as follows: Shmos has 1207 or 1210 depending how you count between Ta'amei elyon and ta'amei tachton of Aseres Hadibros (10 vs 13) in Yisro. Vayikra differs because of Tzav (96 vs 97). Devorim totals 953 or 956 depending how you count between Ta'amei elyon and ta'amei tachton of Aseres Hadibros (10 vs 13) in Vaeschanan where taamei tachton in Artscroll starts at 5:6 and ends at 5:18 for a count of 13 (as it has in Yisro). The mesorah count at the end of Vaeschanan says 118 while the printed count shows 7+49+30+25+11 = 122 for a difference of 4. The ta'amei tachton accounts for the three of the difference. The other parshios match the physical count and the individual parsha mesorah count exactly according to the Art Scroll Chumash. The book totals below though are still off.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/759/double-aa\">Double AA</a> points out: In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67686/759\">another answer</a> I show that the correct mesorah note in old manuscripts for Vaeschanan is 119 which solves the issue in that parsha, but the book total issue remains for Artscroll. However, in Mechon Mamre's edition based on the old manuscripts, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/cu0205.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisro</a> has only 74 verses and <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/cu0502.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vaeschanan</a> has only 121 verse (counting both with taamei tachton, unlike how the individual parsha mesorah does) which gives the correct traditional book totals below of 1209 and 955. So the individual parsha mesorah uses the taamei elyon while the book total uses the taamei tachton, and there are no issues remaining when we use the manuscript versions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torahtots.com/torah/tanach_facts.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Facts</a> says that they got the following numbers from the mesorah. This matches the numbers shown at the end of the Art Scroll Chumash for book totals, but does not match the number of verses they print if you count them.</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis - 1534</p>\n\n<p>Shmos     - 1209</p>\n\n<p>Vayikra   -  859</p>\n\n<p>Bamidbar  - 1288</p>\n\n<p>Devorim   -  955</p>\n\n<p>Total     - 5845</p>\n\n<p>As an example, I estimated (by subtracting) that the current year is about Haazinu 32:24 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מְזֵי רָעָב וּלְחֻמֵי רֶשֶׁף וְקֶטֶב מְרִירִי וְשֶׁן בְּהֵמֹת\n  אֲשַׁלַּח בָּם עִם חֲמַת זֹחֲלֵי עָפָר:</p>\n  \n  <p>They will sprout hair from famine, attacked by demons, excised by\n  Meriri.

Maaseh Bereishis corresponds to the first millenium, the rest of Bereishis to the second, Shemos to the third... so that Devarim corresponds to the sixth millennium. There are 10 parshios in Devarim, each describes a different century.</p>\n\n<p>By that system, the year of the Vilna Gaon's birth (5480) lines up to Devarim 25:15, \"אבן שלמה וצדק יהיה לך איפה שלמה וצדק יהיה לך למען יאריכו ימיך על האדמה אשר ה׳ אלקיך נתן לך. -- A whole and honest weight you should have for your self, a whole and honest measuring eifah you should have for yourself, so that your days shall be long on this earth which Hashem your G-d is giving you.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Even Sheleimah\", a whole [measuring] stone, is taken as a reference to R' Eliyahu Shelomo of Vilna. Which is why the collection of his Mussar thoughts was titled \"Even Sheleimah\".</p>\n\n<p>It is also why students of the Vilna Gaon made aliyah at the beginning of the next century -- 5601. After all, the next parashah begins \"והיה כי תבוא אל הארץ אשר ה׳ אלקיך נתן לך נחלה וירשתה וישבת בה -- And it will be, when you come to the land which Hashem your G-d is giving you as a legacy, and you will inherit it, and live in it.\"</p>\n\n\n",

As he puts it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סיפר: בבריסק, בימי כהונתו של הגרח\"ס, קיים חוג מסויים הצגת חוכא וטלולא על הנושא \"צבא עברי\". לפני צאת הצבא למחלמה הכריז המפקד: \"מי האיש אשר בנה בית חדש ולא חנכו, ילך וישוב לביתו, פן ימות במלחמה ואיש אחר יחנכו.\" מיד קמו אלף חיילים, הצדיעו ועזבו את המערכה. קם מפקד שני והודיע: \"ומי האיש אשר נטע כרם ולא חללו ילך וישוב לביתו פן ימות במלחמה ואיש אחר יחללנו.\" הלכו להם כעוד אלפיים איש. התמתח מפקד שלישי וקרא: \"וומי האיש אשר ארש אשה ולא לקחה ילך וישוב לביתו פן ימות במלחמה ואיש אחר יקחנה.\" התרוממו עוד אלפיים איש ובשתיקת אלם עזבו את מקום ריכוזם. בא מפקד רביעי והכריז: \"מי האיש הירא ורך הלבב ילך וישוב לביתו ולא ימס את לבב אחיו כלבבו.\" הצדיעו עוד שלשת אלפים חיילים והלכו להם. על הבמה נשארו רק שניים, והם: הגאון מווילנה ובעל \"שאגת אריה\". התחילו שניהם במשא ומתן של הלכה, מי קודם למי במצוה זו של מלחמה באויב. כשסיפרו להגרח\"ס על דבר ההצגה וסיומה, אמר: \"השחקנים צודקים, אלא שיש להוסיף, כי דווקא שני הזקנים האלה ניצחו במלחמה.\"</p>\n<p>\"He [R' Baruch Ber] told over: \"In Brisk, during the reign of the GRaCha\"S (the Gaon Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik), a certain group organized a satire play on the subject of \"a Hebrew army\". Before the army set out to war, the commander announced: \"\"“Is there anyone who has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his home, lest he die in battle and another dedicate it.\" Immediately, a thousand soldiers rose up, saluted and left the battlefield. The second commander stood up and announced: \"Is there anyone who has planted a vineyard but has never harvested it? Let him go back to his home, lest he die in battle and another harvest it.\" And so, some two-thousand more men left. The third commander rose up and called: \"Is there anyone who has paid the bride-price for a wife, but who has not yet married her? Let him go back to his home, lest he die in battle and another marry her.\" Another two-thousand men rose and in utter silence left the gathering place. Came the fourth commander and said: \"Is there anyone afraid and disheartened? Let him go back to his home, lest the courage of his comrades flag like his.\" Three thousand more men saluted and left. On the stage remained only two, and they are: The Gaon of Vilna and the \"Sha'agat Aryeh\". The two began a back-and-forth in halacha over who has precedent in this mitzvah of battling an enemy.</p>\n<p>When they told the GRaCha\"S about this play and how it ended, he said: \"The actors are correct, however it must be added, that precisely these two old men won the war.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The story is also brought by Chaim Walder <a href=\"https://www.93fm.co.il/radio/391971/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. He quotes it out of one of Rabbi Shimon Meller's books about the Brisk dynasty but doesn't specify which one. In his version, the group who set up the play were maskilim. I haven't managed to get access to Rabbi Meller's books.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I have yet to find external evidence for this play. It's possible that it first appeared as a satirical story in one of the haskalic publications of the era and was then made into a play. The style described is very in-line with what the more extreme maskilim would do, which is satirically mocking Torah. Perhaps it was just a one-time thing, though (from what I've read, plays that were preserved were usually performed multiple times).</p>\n\n\n",

I will, <em>bli neder</em> try to do this with my rav. If possible, edit my answer afterwards. I shall summarize the article's main points.</p>\n\n<p>The source of not allowing Torah thoughts, reciting shema, etc, originates from the verse Deuteronomy 23:15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ מִתְהַלֵּ֣ךְ ׀ בְּקֶ֣רֶב מַחֲנֶ֗ךָ\n  לְהַצִּֽילְךָ֙ וְלָתֵ֤ת אֹיְבֶ֙יךָ֙ לְפָנֶ֔יךָ <strong>וְהָיָ֥ה מַחֲנֶ֖יךָ\n  קָד֑וֹשׁ</strong> וְלֹֽא־יִרְאֶ֤ה בְךָ֙ עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר וְשָׁ֖ב מֵאַחֲרֶֽיךָ׃\n  )</p>\n  \n  <p>For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver\n  thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; <strong>therefore shall thy\n  camp be holy</strong>; that He see no unseemly thing in thee, and turn away\n  from thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Making the camp \"holy\", in this case, means distancing oneself from צואה - feces. (See the verses preceding the one that I cited to understand why.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the concern is dealing with a permanent <em>bet hakiseh</em> - a room designated for use of relieving oneself. According to most opinions, one may not think Torah thoughts in a permanent <em>bet hakiseh</em> even if there is no excrement present there.</p>\n\n<p>The flip side of the problem is whether today's modern \"bathrooms\" fit the Talmudic definition of <em>bet hakiseh</em> since excrement is flushed down and is rarely present.</p>\n\n<p>That's the part of the discussion you need to read and discuss further with a rav.</p>\n\n\n",

If a person cannot attend any of the three minyonim on a particular day, he cannot \"make it up\" on a different day. Chabad.org (shown below) recommends that one learn or give tzedakah or emphasize a mitzvah in honor of the deceased parent.

Does Rav Rabinovitch perhaps side with the Ra’avya (ch. 197, p. 256) against the Yere'im (ch. 274, 134b; see Shulchan Arukh 318:5) and rules that <em>ein bishul achar afiyah</em> (There is no cooking after baking)? The sense from their site is that no significant heat is employed to justify such an interpretation either, even assuming that leniency. Do they indeed employ a greater level of heat than other tea manufacturers?

I will place My Torah inside them, and write it upon their hearts.\"</p>\n\n<p>So the content of this \"new covenant\" is exactly the same G-dly Torah and mitzvos as we have had until now. The difference is just that previously, unfortunately, we violated it numerous times, whereas in the future era of Moshiach, when G-d will \"banish the spirit of impurity from the earth\" (Zech. 13:2), we will no longer have an evil inclination that tempts us to do so; what G-d wants us to do will be a basic part of our psyche (\"written upon our hearts\").</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, for anyone who wants to research this further: this is one of the places where the numbering differs between our Tanachs and, lehavdil, the common non-Jewish translations; the verse cited in the question is 31:30 in a Tanach. Why the difference - I don't know.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The important details to understand from this quote is that this covenant is only with the Jewish people, not with non-Jews. Additionally, it is important to include the 35th through 39th posukim from the chapter which emphasizes that the Torah of Moshe, 'these ordinances', shall always be. They shall not be 'plucked out' or 'thrown out' even by a false prophet or dreamer of dreams or a miracle worker who arises from amongst the Jewish people and says either, \"Let us follow alien gods.\" or says, \"I will add or subtract from these commandments.\" Like for for example the Jew who did miracles and said that his commandment, the commandment that he added to G-d's commandments, was to \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\"</p>\n\n<p>The concept of 'the new covenant' is that there will be a completely new and deeper insight into the covenant that G-d made at Har Sinai. The root of this word 'new', is also associated with the meaning of 'chiddush', which means 'innovation'.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, what Jeremiah is talking about is that with the final redemption there will be an innovation in the understanding of the covenant that was made at Har Sinai through the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>It is a continuation and preservation of the covenant made at Har Sinai with Moshe. Not an overturning of this covenant like is taught in Christianity.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, it is possible that they will repent and [their sin] will be forgiven, as in the case of the people of Nineveh, or that [retribution] will be held in abeyance, as in the case of Hezekiah.\n  <br>But if [a prophet] promised that good would come and such and such will occur, and the good about which he prophesied did not materialize, he is surely a false prophet. Any good which God decrees - even if [the decree] is provisional - will never be nullified. \n  We can conclude from this that a prophet should be tested on the basis of his positive prophecies. This was what Jeremiah meant by his reply to Chananiah ben Azur, when he was prophesying doom and Chananiah was promising a [glorious future]. He told Chananiah: \"If my words are not fulfilled, this will not lead to the conclusion that I am a false prophet. If your promises are not fulfilled, however, it will be proven that you are a false prophet,\" as implied by [Jeremiah 28:7,9]: \"Hear, now, this word... As for the prophet who prophesies for peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, it will be known that God has truly sent this prophet.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, these seem like conflicting ideas. There are several explanations. For example, the Radak <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/tora/parashat-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a> that it is true that a good prophecy cannot be canceled (and so one can test a prophet who foretells a good thing). He explains the verse above from Jeremiah so that people may sin, and the good thing that was supposed to happen will be therefore <strong>postponed</strong>, but it will eventually come.\nMore sources about this issue <a href=\"http://www.herzog.ac.il/vtc/0052132.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should we replace fear of G-d with love of G-d?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've always heard that we should love G-d with all our hearts but also fear Him. I've understood all my life that fearing G-d is a fundamental midah, something every Jew must have. But I've also heard things and teachings that seem to contradict this:</p>\n\n<p>The first example is a story (possibly a Midrash) of the giving of the Torah to Am Israel. This story says that before G-d gave us the Torah, he placed Har Sinai above all the Yehudim and said that if they didn't accept the Torah He would crush the mountain on them. Instead of answering that they would accept the Torah with fear, they answered with love and joy. Passing G-d's test. This suggests that G-d prefers we do the things He asks because we love Him, and not because we fear Him or the punishment.</p>\n\n<p>The second example is Teshuvah. I heard from my rabbi that there are two ways of doing Teshuvah: one is because of fear of G-d and the other because of love of G-d. A Teshuvah made out of fear is accepted but it's not as good as a Teshuvah made out of love of G-d. This would suggest that doing things out of love of G-d is superior than doing things out of fear of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Should we actually fear G-d?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Mesilas Yasharim (ch 24), Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato describes three kinds of fear: The lowest is fear of punishment. This is not fear of G-d, but it might be useful for keeping oneself in line.</p>\n\n<p>Fear of G-d comes in two sorts: fear of sinning -- not of the punishment, but of the sin itself, and awe of G-d's Grandeur. But when our sages speak of fear of G-d without qualification, the Ramchal tells us they are referring to fear of sin.</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean to fear sin, rather than to fear punishment?  In a healthy marriage, does a husband worry about what his wife will do to him? Or worried that he won't be able to do for her everything he is trying to?</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Avraham Elya Kaplan wrote in the title essay of <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/raek/yirah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Be'iqvos haYir'ah (in the Footprints of Fear)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…To what may yir’ah be likened? To the tremor of fear which a father feels when his beloved young son rides his shoulders as he dances with him and rejoices before him, taking care that he not fall off. Here there is joy that is incomparable, pleasure that is incomparable. And the fear tied up with them is pleasant too. It does not impede the freedom of dance…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yir'ah is that difference between celebrating your daughter's wedding, and celebrating your neighbor's daughter's. It is because the event matters so much in your own life and that of someone you care about, it is because they are stepping off into the unknown, that the joy is all that much greater. Yir'ah feeds joy.</p>\n\n<p>As the Torah says (and we say every morning), the Jews stood at the Red Sea as it split, looking at their dead oppressors, \"And Israel saw the 'Great Hand' which Hashem worked in Egypt, and the nation felt yir'ah for Hashem, and they trusted in Hashem and in Moshe His servant. Then, Moshe and the Israelites would sing...\"</p>\n\n<p>True yir'ah is not the trembling that immobilizes. It's the realization of the import of what you are doing. (This \"awareness of import\" is why yir'ah refer to both fear of sin and awe confronting Hashem's grandeur.) Yir'as hacheit, fear of messing up because you want things to turn out right. More so, it is a fear of G-d, a fear of not disappointing one's Beloved.</p>\n\n<p>You ask: Should we replace fear of G-d with love of G-d?

One of the translations of the word is \"prosecutor\". Only human beings have free will and the associated \"desires\" that can cause them to rebel against Hashem and violate his commandments.</p>\n\n<p>For example <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/satan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Concepts:\nSatan</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Satan in Judaism is not a physical being ruling the underworld,\n  rather, in the Torah, the word Satan indicates “accuser,” “hinderer”\n  or “tempter.” Satan is therefore more an illusory obstacle in one’s\n  way - such as temptation and evil doings - keeping one from completing\n  the responsibilities of tikkun olam (fixing the world). Satan is the\n  evil inclination to veer off the path of righteousness and\n  faithfulness in God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Note that this is restricted to the \"being\" known as \"Satan\" rather than Hashem sending a human being (who does have free will) or a \"natural force\" (like lightning or a wind) which does not have the concept of free will as a messenger. That is a different area. Also note that a malach in the literal sense (translated as angel) only exists while carrying out its mission.

Why do we believe that? Why, for example, can't we say that the book of Genesis was written by Jacob, for example, and has the level of holiness and authenticity as a book of the Prophets?

Why can't we say it's included with the Torah as an addendum but not that God told that part to Moses?</p>\n\n<p>Is it simply because by the time of the Gemara it was a relatively central and widespread belief, and, in the absence of any major compelling reason to say otherwise, that became recognized as a core belief?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I know that the Torah includes phrasing like \"this entire book of the Torah,\" which the Torah says was given to the Jewish people by God through Moses.

Similar to what it says in Yirmiyahu 36: From His mouth he recites to me all these words and I write them in this sefer in ink</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, he doesn't demonstrate how he knows this to be true. Rabbeinu Bachaye to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya,_Devarim.29.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 29:6</a>  gives an explanation, and perhaps this is where the Ramban is coming from.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהרי <strong>קבלה בידינו שכל התורה כלה</strong> מבראשית עד לעיני כל ישראל הכל כתב משה מפי הגבורה</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold <strong>it is a tradition in our hands that the entire Torah</strong>, from the first word Bereishis until the last words Leinei Kol Yisroel, they were all written by Moshe as directed by the Mighty One.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says clearly that it is knowledge we have that came through mesorah, tradition. That's the source.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Really I think this is a very important question, one that I have struggled with. </p>\n\n<p>To me, it comes down to the question of free will. If we are to accept that the whole Torah in its current form was dictated by Hashem to Moses at Sinai, then he would have been tasked with describing the events of the future, which, although we can assume that Moses would have accepted as Hashem's plan, would have been troubling for him to say the least, given the events in the Bamidbar and D'Varim.</p>\n\n<p>So if we are to imagine Moses, on Sinai for forty days, grappling with visions of his own future, and the struggles described in Bamidbar / Numbers,  we can believe that the Torah was revealed to Moses entirely, but not necessarily assume that Moses fully even believed all of it himself. </p>\n\n<p>For example, when he and Aaron disobeyed Hashem's instructions to speak to the rock and bring forth water from it, and thereby brought about his own downfall, (which Rashi tells us was forseen by Pharoah's astrologers), we must assume that although the whole Torah was revealed to Moses, he did not fully accept the parts of it pertaining to himself, or perhaps he forgot, or in his anger/frustration, neglected what he had been instructed to do. Hence many years in the wilderness.</p>\n\n<p>So the question, if I might suggest a clarification, is \"in what <em>form</em> was the Torah given on Sinai, and to what extent did Moses record it?\" This is where Christianity and Judaism split very clearly, as Christians believe that only the Ten Commandments were given at this point, which is, I believe, along the lines to your original question.</p>\n\n<p>At Sinai, the Torah is not completely written down until Deuteronamy, which is three books later. So we must assume it took Moses years to express everything that had been revealed to him, and even in the end, as we saw with the water and the rock, he seemed apparently predestined to fail, and was denied access to he promised land, along with the generation that wandered in the wilderness. So there must have been some pre-and-post rationalisation on Moses part.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>12 HASHEM said to Moses and to Aaron, \"Because you did not believe in\n  Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the Children of Israel, therefore\n  you will not bring this congregation to the land that I have given\n  them\". 13 They are the waters of strife, where the Children of Israel\n  contended with HASHEM, and He was sanctified through them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we must each ask ourselves - am <em>I</em> the waters of strife? Is my lack of faith going to cause unpleasant consquences like these? </p>\n\n<p>This is why Jews believe that the whole Torah was revealed to Moses at Sinai, (in its entirety), in my humble opinion. Thanks for reading, I've learned a lot myself by just writing this comment.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Shemot 24:12 states that God wrote the Torah.

    "content": "# Halachic considerations regarding moving to Mars\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question is independent of particular halachic issues that an observant Jew would face <em>on</em> Mars. It is not even about the legality of the decision to move to Mars in light of the knowledge that many obstacles to observance may be insurmountable there. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/60938/1516\">here</a> and perhaps <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/30683/mission-to-mars-halachic-challenges\">here</a>. I would add that there are many, more obvious issues that aren't listed in the links--such as sakone, p'ru urevu/onah [at least one of these would have to be fulfilled on Mars, and both seem to be <a href=\"http://www.space.com/10822-sex-mars-pregnancy-space-risks.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nearly impossible</a>], bikur cholim, hachnosas kallah, sukkah, hachnosas or'chim, <a href=\"http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/mars/ask/atmosphere/Combustion_on_Mars.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos/holiday/yahrzeit candles</a>, and even possibly netilat yadayim, tzedakah/maaser/tevel, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2006/06/mars-no-one-can-hear-you-scream\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shofar</a>, tefillin, getting rid of chometz, muktzeh, zecher l'churban, and who knows what others.)</p>\n<p>It is more about whether anything in our sources addresses a hypothetical requirement to live on Earth. Although space travel may not have been explicitly foreseen nor prohibited, it does seem to me that very much of the Jewish worldview is based on the fact of living on Earth, and that hashkafically, there could be some problem. I keep coming back to the question of what will happen to those on Mars when Moshiach comes, for example. Are they still under Moshiach's aegis; will their lives change? Presumably, yes. But then, doesn't Moshiach's aegis have limits? It seems like a stretch to imagine that his coming will affect conditions on ULAS J0015+01, for example.</p>\n<p>The one textual reference I can find for my question is this verse in Psalms (115:16): \"השמים שמים לה' והארץ נתן לבני אדם\"--\"the Heavens belong to Hashem, but the earth He has given to man.\"</p>\n<p>Can anyone bring any other Jewish sources, either for or against accepting a one-way ticket to Mars? (The connection need not be overt.)</p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27107/what-defines-on-this-earth-from-a-halachic-standpoint\">What defines \"on this earth\" from a halachic standpoint?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rav Menashe Klien was asked if one can say kiddush levana while physically on the moon. He answers in his <em>Mishne Halachos</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1878&pgnum=316\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:259</a>) that there is no difference between standing on the moon and on earth regarding kiddush levanah.</p>\n<p>He then writes that going to the moon altogether should be prohibited for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The trip to the moon is dangerous.</li>\n<li>Once one is on the moon, they cannot breath without support (if they take helmet off).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He concludes it shouldn't be done and uses a Devarim 4:19 as a supporting a remez. This reasoning should apply to Mars as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I heard from a reliable talmud chacham in the name of R' Moshe Feinstein that at the time of the 'space race' he was asked for thsi thoughts, and he answered that people should not live in space for more than 30 days - as the posuk says 'והארץ נתן לבני אדם' – 'and the earth He gave to mankind'(Tehillim 115:16). Which implies that mankind was only given permission to dwell on Earth, but not elsewhere. Meaning that the universe belongs to G-d and we cannot presume mastery over it without permission.  I do not know if this was ever recorded in writing anywhere but it is an interesting idea.<br />\n(Also, if I could add, when Hashem created mankind - he told them to \"fill the earth and conquer it\" (Bereishis 1:28) which similarly sounds like it is referring just to the Earth). I am not sure if he meant this in a halachic sense or not, but definitely in hashkafa it is a new perspective.</p>\n\n\n",

He brings the Mechilta and then sometimes adds his own thoughts.</p>\n<p>Here's a brief summary (with some possible additions). The original is below.</p>\n<p><strong>1. I am the Lord your Gcd <-> 6. Murder</strong></p>\n<p>As humans are created in the image of Gcd, killing a person diminishes the godliness in this world. (Besides for the murderer <em>playing Gcd</em> by deciding who gets to live/die.)</p>\n<p>It's also a reminder that Esav didn't receive the Torah because they live <em>on their sword</em>; belief in Gcd and belief in one's own power don't go together.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do not have any other gods <-> 7. Adultery</strong></p>\n<p>Adultery: <em>Using</em> someone else's spouse, the way the idol worshiper worships a partner along with Gcd. (Besides for the adulterer profaning the sanctity of marriage.)</p>\n<p>Also, throughout Tanach we see adultery is used as an idiom for idolatry.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Name in vain <-> 8. Stealing</strong></p>\n<p>Taking something that you shouldn't. (Besides for the thief will have to make a false oath to cover himself.)</p>\n<p>Also, both these involve the concept that <em>Gcd isn't watching me when I sin</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Shabbat <-> 9. False witness</strong></p>\n<p>Shabbat observation declares our belief that Gcd created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th. Desecrating Shabbat makes us a false witness - or destroys the ability to be a good witness.</p>\n<p>Also, proper Shabbat observance involves only talking Shabbat-permitted talk; highlighting the concept of <em>sanctifying speech</em>. False testimony is prevented when realising that speech needs to be sanctified.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Honouring parents <-> 10. Coveting</strong></p>\n<p>By following through with the <em>coveting</em> of another's wife, you create situations whereby it becomes impossible to honour one's parents, and the kid will never know who its father is.</p>\n<p>Also, somebody who covets other's money can't honour his parents properly, as his entire life is focused on <em>more money</em>, leaving no time or energy for honouring parents.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא תרצח לא תנאף וגו'. אחר שהשלים ה' דברות שבין אדם למקום ברוך הוא הזכיר כנגדם ה' דברות שבין אדם לחבירו כדרך שנזכרו במכילתא איך היו מקבילים זה לעומת זה והדמיונות ההם כי מה שאמרו לא תרצח כנגד אנכי, כי כל מי ששופך דמים כאילו ממעט הצלם והדמות שנאמר (בראשית ט.ו) שופך דם האדם באדם דמו ישפך כי בצלם אלהים עשה את האדם. ואין צורך לטעם זה כי אם לאומר הרגני נא הרוג ומוחל לו ההריגה ואעפ\"כ דמו ישפך כי לא ניתן למחילה בעבור שיש בו חלק אלוה ממעל וחלק גבוה מי יתיר וזהו הטעם גם בהורג עצמו.‏</p>\n<p>וענין הצלם והדמות הוא, שבכל המראות דרכו ית' להתראות בדמיון צלם האדם אע\"פ שבלי ספק אין שם צלם ודמות כביכול כמ\"ש (ישעיה מ.כה) ואל מי תדמיוני ואשוה יאמר קדוש. וכתיב מה דמות תערכו לו, (שם מ.יח) מ\"מ כשהוא מתראה אז הוא מראה דמות אדם לבריות ובעבור חשיבתו של האדם הוא מתראה בדמיון זה כמ\"ש (יחזקאל א.כו) ועל הכסא דמות כמראה אדם, הנך רואה שבאמת לא היה שם מראה אדם אלא דמות כמראה אדם וכן נראה על הים כגבור ועל הר סיני כזקן, ולפיכך ראוי לנהוג כבוד באותו דמות והרוצח ממעט הדמות כי הוא גורם שאין הקב\"ה ירצה עוד להתראות בדמיון זה מאחר שהוא בזוי על הבריות והרואה הנרצח הוא דוגמת כי קללת אלהים תלוי ואין להאריך עוד מזה. ‏</p>\n<p>ולי נראה לומר לכך בא דבור <strong>לא תרצח, כנגד אנכי</strong>, לפי שיעקב ועשו עשו חלוקה ביניהם כי יעקב בחר לו יה לחלקו וה' מנת חלקו ועשו בחר לו אומנות על חרבך תחיה וע\"כ כפר בעיקר כדמסיק (בב\"ב טז:) שכפר בעיקר מדכתיב למה זה לי וכתיב זה אלי וגו'. ולפיכך בא ציווי אנכי לבית יעקב, וכנגד זה הזהירם שלא יאחזו באומנות עשו כי אומנות זה הביאו לידי כפירה ומטעם לא תרצח לא קבלו בני עשו התורה כי הרציחה מביאו לידי כפירה באנכי ה' אלהיך וא\"כ בטלה כל התורה כ\"א אין מצוה אין מקום לשום ציווי וע\"כ לא רצה לקבל אפילו שאר הדברות כי ענין הרציחה סותר הכל, כי הרוצח חושב שהוא עושה רצון מזל מאדים בכח השר של מעלה ובזה הוא מכחיש אלהותו ית' ואלו דברים עתיקים. ‏</p>\n<p><strong>לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים, כנגדו לא תנאף</strong>. כמ\"ש בעובדי ע\"ז האשה המנאפת וגו' (יחזקאל טז.לב) וכן רבים. ול\"נ לומר שהניאוף גורם גם לעבוד ע\"ז ומעשה בעל פעור בשיטים יוכיח וכמ\"ש בחיתון ז' אומות כי יסיר את בנך מאחרי (דברים ז.א) כי אין לך דבר המביא לידי ע\"ז כמו פיתוי אשה זרה אשר בחלק שפתיה תדיחנו מעל ה' ודבר זה ידוע ומפורסם והמפורסמות א\"צ ראיה. ‏</p>\n<p><strong>לא תשא כנגד לא תגנוב</strong>. כי הגונב סופו לישבע לשקר שנאמר (ויקרא יט.יא–יב) לא תגנובו וגו' ולא תשבעו וגו' כי זה גורר את זה ולכך נאמר (זכריה ה.ד) ובאה אל בית הגנב ואל בית הנשבע בשמי לשקר וכלתו וגו'. השוה ב' עבירות אלו לפי שאחת גוררת חבירתה וענינם אחד כי הגונב עושה עין של מעלה כאילו אינו רואה כביכול וכן זה הנשבע לשקר כדי לאמת שקרו בפני הבריות עושה ג\"כ עין של מעלה כאילו אינו רואה כביכול, ולפיכך מאן דעביד הא נפיל בהא אף אם נשבע באיזה דבר אחר שאינו מענין גניבה כך נ\"ל נוסף על מה שנזכר במכילתא. ‏</p>\n<p><strong>זכור את יום השבת, כנגדו לא תענה</strong>. כי כל מחלל שבת מעיד שלא ברא הקב\"ה עולמו בו' ימים ונח בז'. ול\"נ לפי שנאמר בשבת ממצוא חפצך ודבר דבר (ישעיה נח.יג) וארז\"ל (שבת קיג:) שלא יהא דבורך של שבת כדבורך של חול, וטעמו של דבר הוא לפי שכל פעולות האדם הוא בכלי המעשה שלו אבל פעולת הקב\"ה הוא בדבור לבד כי בדבר ה' שמים נעשו, והוא אמר ויהי, (תהלים לג.ו–ט) ולפי זה כשהאדם שובת בשבת ואינו עושה מלאכה בכלי המעשה שלו אין שביתה זו דומה לשביתת הקב\"ה כי הקב\"ה שבת אפילו מדיבור פיו והאדם אינו שובת כ\"א מפעולת כלי המעשה ע\"כ נאמר ודבר דבר שלא יהא דבורך של שבת כדבורך של חול לזכור שביתת הקב\"ה אשר שבת מן הדבור וממנו תראה וכן תעשה שלא לדבר בשבת מחפצך כי אם מחפצי שמים וע\"י שיזכור את יום השבת שהוא מחוייב לקדש מוצא שפתיו שלא לדבר בדברי חול אז לפחות בשאר ימות השבוע אע\"פ שכלי שנשתמש בו קודש בשבת ישתמש בו חול בימי השבוע מ\"מ לפחות יקדש דברי שפתיו שלא להוציא שקר מפיו ולענות סרה בחבירו. ‏</p>\n<p><strong>כבד את אביך וגו', כנגדו לא תחמוד</strong>. ומסיק במכילתא שכל החומד לסוף מוליד בן שמקללו ודבר זה מחוסר ביאור כי מה ענין זה לזה, ונראה לפרש לפי שכל חומד אשת רעהו ודאי הוא מהרהר בה בשעת תשמיש ודומה כאילו הבן נולד לו מאשה אחרת אשר חמד והרהר בה ע\"כ אינו מכבד את אמו כראוי לפי שאביו היה מהרהר באשה אחרת, וגם את אביו לא יכבד כראוי כי החומד נשים אין כוונתו להוליד כי אם למלאות תאותו ולא נתכוין אל בן זה להולידו ע\"כ דומה כאילו אינו בנו וע\"כ לא יכבדו גם כן כי הכל הולך אחר הכוונה, וחמדת ממון תלוי ג\"כ בכבוד אב ואם כי החומד ממון אחרים אינו מכבדם כראוי מחמת היותו להוט בפולמוס חמדת הממון כי הכיבוד הוא מהונו להאכילם ולהשקותם ולהלבישם, וזה החומד בלי ספק שעינו צרה גם באביו ואמו מלתת להם די מחסורם.  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes, this seem to be the idea.

Written text is static, an orality is dynamic. Hashem didn't \"Want\" to hand us halakhah as a set of fixed laws, He \"Wanted\" us to figure our which path we will take to redeem ourselves. This is an aspect of what it means when it says \"these [the positions of Beis Shammai] and those [of Beis Hillel] are the Ideas of the 'Living' G-d. And the halakhah is like Beis Hillel.\" If everything were text, there would only be one opinion, no human contribution. As it is, we are told halakhah on a meta-level, we are told how to extrapolate and interpolate new Torah from existing Torah.</p>\n<p>This is also why the need to codify the mishnah was considered a tragic expediency necessary for Torah to survive altogether under Roman oppression. It's not that memorizing the Torah is better than having it written down, it's that the halakhah gained a rigidity that we would have been better off without.</p>\n<p>If there were no Oral Torah, there would be no system of extrapolation to new cases like electricity of fax machines.</p>\n<p>Some understand this as being a difference between the first Tablets and the second. R Yoseif Dov Soloveitchik (the first; ie the Beis haLevi, Derashah 17) writes that the first Tablets contained the entire Torah, even down to “a question a student will ask his rebbe in the last generation.” With the second Tablets came the concept of Oral Torah and the need for Torah study. They entail Hashem’s choice to make Torah less well known but more internalized into the people. Making the nation Hashem’s “parchment”. (Or as I put it, making the Torah a process, which then requires the Jewish People to actually progress.)</p>\n<p>The Beis haLevi refers to the thought of Chazal which says that had we not made the Golden Calf, the redemption from Egypt would have been the complete redemption. That sin necessitated further exiles, a longer process to reach the ultimate redemption, And this is why the first Tablets could not exist in a post-calf world — for two reasons: First, because without the Torah being intimately tied to the Jewish People, our host nations would have co-opted it.

I have seen similar explanations, though not as many, for events like those of the Crusades, the expulsion from Spain, the pogroms at the turn of the 20th century and (of course) the destruction of the temples.

I would like to know if there are any theological explanations that have been given for this tragedy in particular?</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I am not asking for a general theological justification for suffering, for apostasy or even for false messiahs. <strong>I am asking whether or not there are published theological justifications for the false messianism and apostasy of Shabbetai Tzvi <em>in particular</em></strong>.

The <em>medrash</em> states (<em>Shemos Raba</em> 14:3, also see <em>Tanchuma, Va'era</em> 14, and <em>Tana D'Vei Eliyahu</em> 7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why did He bring darkness upon them? Blessed be the Name of the Holy One, blessed is He, for there is no favoritism before Him, Who delves deep into the [human] mind and examines [their] thoughts: For there were sinners (פושעים, Rashi here has רשעים, \"wicked people\") in Israel who had patrons among the Egyptians, and they had wealth and honor there, and they did not wish to leave. God said, \"If I bring a plague upon [these sinful Jews] openly and they die, the Egyptians will say, 'The same thing that is happening to us is also happening to them!'\" Therefore He brought the darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, so that [the Jews] would be able to bury their dead, and their enemies would not see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There were Jews who were comfortable in Egypt and did not want to leave. The Sages do not accuse these people of any kind of sinful behavior, whether towards God or to their fellow men. Their entire wickedness is summed up in the fact that they did not wish to leave Egypt! </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, we know that there were some genuinely wicked Jews who did leave Egypt together with their fellow Jews, the best known examples being the famous troublemakers, Dathan and Abiram. And the Jewish people as a whole were far from perfect. The Sages tell us that when God drowned the Egyptians at the Red Sea, the angels challenged the Divine Justice in drowning the Egyptians and not drowning the children of Israel, famously declaring, \"הללו עובדי עבודה זרה והללו עובדי עבודה זרה\" - \"These are idol worshipers and those are idol worshipers!\"</p>\n\n<p>The implication of this <em>medrash</em> is that the issue was not that these particular Jews were exceptionally sinful, but rather that they were sinful in a very specific way, one which made it impossible for them to live to see the redemption of their people from Egypt. This was the simple fact that, regardless of any other virtues they may have possessed, these Jews wanted to stay in Egypt. They were quite comfortable in Egypt, and they saw no reason to leave!</p>\n\n<p>As Jews, we have an obligation to see ourselves as part of a larger unit, the Jewish people, to which we are intrinsically connected. Our connection to God as individuals cannot be distinguished from our connection to the Jewish people as a whole. We can never simply go our own way, as if the fate of our fellow Jews means no more than that of any other random group of people.</p>\n\n<p>From my blog post, <a href=\"http://shesileizeisim.blogspot.com/2013/01/bo-do-not-separate-from-community.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Do Not Separate from the Community</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I would add that Rav Shimon Schwab argues (convincingly, in my opinion) that the medrash regarding the large numbers of Jews who died during the plague of darkness is not intended to be taken literally.</p>\n\n\n",

Was this Masoretic, as well?</p>\n\n<p>Who (if someone else) created it? What is the purpose for doing this? I understand what it accomplishes, as I explained, above, but what significance does reading the 10 Commandments one way or the other have?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hatanakh.com/sites/herzog/files/herzog/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA%20%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A2_237.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This short article</a> (Hebrew) by Prof Yosef Ofer explains that the two sets of trope are essentially the products of two different <em>mesorot</em>:</p>\n\n<p>The set known as <em>ta'am tachton</em>, which breaks the Decalogue into twelve verses, is the Israeli <em>mesorah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The set known as <em>ta'am elyon</em>, which breaks the Decalogue into ten verses (one per commandment), is based on the Babylonian <em>mesorah</em>, which broke the verses up in this way. This alternative version of breaking up the text made its way to the Tiberian Masoretes in Israel, who then annotated the text with their own system of vowels and trope, in order to be able to read the Decalogue as ten verses of wildly differing lengths, becoming what we now see as <em>ta'am elyon</em>. They then presented this version alongside their original twelve-verse version (<em>ta'am tachton</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding how the two sets are used today, there are a number of customs:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.494.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Biur Halacha 494</a> records two practices: One that reserves <em>ta'am elyon</em> for reading the Decalogue on <em>shavu'ot</em> morning only, and another which uses <em>ta'am elyon</em> for all public reading (<em>shavu'ot</em>, <em>shabbat parashat yitro</em> and <em>shabbat parashat va'etchanan</em>), whereas <em>ta'am tachton</em> is used only by an individual reading the verses.</p>\n\n<p>Yemenite Jews only use <em>ta'am elyon</em>, even for individual learning. In fact, Yemenite printings of the text only contain <em>ta'am elyon</em>. (See footnote 16 <a href=\"https://www.maharitz.co.il/?CategoryID=294&ArticleID=4695\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.) Incidentally, this is consistent with <em>ta'am elyon</em> having a Babylonian origin, as Yemenite tradition is heavily based on original Babylonian practice.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, it is recorded in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58735&st=&pgnum=146\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Reshimot Shi'urim Berachot 12a</a> in the name of R. Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, that R. Chaim Soloveitchik only ever used <em>ta'am tachton</em>, even on <em>shavu'ot</em>, as he did not want to break up verses in a different way to (what he believed was) the authentic <em>mesorah</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=284\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=284</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who looks at the text of the Ten Commandments in a Torah scroll\n  will notice that the Torah assigns a separate paragraph for each\n  commandment. Even the very short commandments, such as “Lo Tirsah” and\n  “Lo Tinaf,” comprise an independent paragraph, as do the longer\n  commandments, such as “Lo Yihiye” and “Zachor.” The “Ta’am Elyon”\n  system of cantillation notes follows this arrangement, and makes each\n  commandment no more and no less than a single verse. This means that\n  the longer commandments are made into a single verse despite their\n  length, and the short commandments, such as “Lo Tirsah” and “Lo\n  Tinaf,” are assigned a brief, two-word verse. The exception to this\n  rule is the first two commandments, which are combined into a single\n  verse in the “Ta’am Elyon.” The reason for this exception is that,\n  according to tradition, when God proclaimed the Ten Commandments, He\n  uttered the first two commandments as a single statement. Therefore,\n  even in the “Ta’am Elyon,” which reflects the manner in which the\n  commandments were heard at Sinai, the first two commandments are\n  combined.</p>\n  \n  <p>We refer to this system at the “Ta’am Elyon” (literally, “upper\n  cantillaton”) because generally speaking, the Te’amim that are used to\n  extend a verse are the notes positioned on top of the word, such as\n  the Pazer Gadol and Azla Geresh.</p>\n  \n  <p>This system is used for the public Torah reading, whenever the Ten\n  Commandments are read. Namely, on Shabuot, on Shabbat Parashat Yitro\n  and on Shabbat Parashat Vaethanan, the Ten Commandments are read using\n  the “Ta’am Elyon,” so that they are read the way they were heard by\n  the Jewish people at Sinai.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although there is a tradition that a verse cannot be shorter than\n  three words, we allow separate verses for the two-word commandments in\n  the public reading, because this is how the Jews heard the\n  proclamation of the Ten Commandments at Sinai.</p>\n  \n  <p>The “Ta’am Tahton” system is used when a person reads the Ten\n  Commandments privately, such as for the weekly “Shenayim Mikra Ve’ehad\n  Targum” reading or for general individual learning. This system breaks\n  up the text of the Ten Commandments according to the common,\n  conventional length of verses. This means that the longer\n  commandments, such as “Lo Yihiye” and “Zachor,” are each divided in\n  several verses, and the short commandments – “Lo Tirsah,” “Lo Tinaf,”\n  “Lo Tignob” and “Lo Ta’ane” – are merged into a single verse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, from <a href=\"http://haemtza.blogspot.com/2008/06/standing-up-for-ten-commandments.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://haemtza.blogspot.com/2008/06/standing-up-for-ten-commandments.html</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason for this is the following Halacha: ‘Kol Pesuka D’ Lo Paskiah Moshe, Anan Lo Paskinan’ - we are not permitted to divide Pesukim when reading the Torah - which is a fulfillment of the Mitzvah of learning Torah - differently than the way Moshe did. Sentences read for that purpose must be read whole. The Taam Tachton accomplishes this. Reading the Ten Commandments, however, is more than just a fulfillment of the public learning of Torah. It is a remembrance of receiving the Ten Commandments at Sinai. So we read it with the Taam Elyon to signify that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sense, I think, is that while the written Torah has one basic breakup originating at Sinai of the <em>pesukim</em> (hard stops/<em>sof pasuk</em>)*, the ten commandments have an additional breakup in the way in which they were originally presented at Sinai. These two breakups are the <em>taam tachton</em> and <em>taam elyon</em> respectively. (The other trop notes that were a later addition [by Ezra?] follow the convention that is generated when the breaks are far between.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>*I believe Rav Moshe Feinstein, z\"l, suggests that the soft stop <em>ethnachta</em> might also be Sinaitic in origin.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

This can be seen in the commentary of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Exodus.20.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hizkuni to Shemot 20:14</a>, and is also the practice prescribed by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Masat Binyamin</a>, quoted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.494?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 494:1</a>.</p>\n<p>Magen Avraham  also notes the Sephardic practice, as described by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ibn_Habib\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Menahem de Lonzano</a>, to always use <em>ta'am elyon</em> in public.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, there seem to be many relatively old examples of Ashkenazim following the Sephardic custom. For example, R. Yoseph b. Moshe writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49438&st=%25u05E0%25u05D2%25u05D9%25u05E0%25u05D5%25u05EA&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leket Yosher</a> that his teacher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Isserlein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yisrael Isserlein</a> would always use <em>ta'am elyon</em> for public reading, and would only use <em>ta'am tachton</em> during private study. Similary, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sofer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Sofer</a> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Responsa_Chatam_Sofer%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.260.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Responsa Hatam Sofer Yoreh De'ah 260</a> implies that <em>ta'am tachton</em> is only used for private study, with <em>ta'am elyon</em> used for all public reading.</p>\n<p>As far as why one would differentiate between the reading on Shavu'ot and regular <em>shabbatot</em>, R. Yoseph Dov Soloveitchik, quoted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Reshimot_Shiurim_on_Berakhot.12a.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reshimot Shi'urim Berachot 12a</a>, suggests that the use of <em>ta'am elyon</em> is to, in a sense, recreate the experience of the Giving of the Torah at Mt Sinai, whereby we read each individual commandment as its own verse. The differing customs then reflect a disagreement as to whether this 'recreation' is only done on Shavu'ot, the anniversary of the Giving of the Torah, or instead whenever the Decalogue is read publically.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Dr Yosef Ofer in <a href=\"https://www2.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/shavuot/ofe.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> suggests that the Ashkenazi custom of only reading with <em>ta'am elyon</em> on Shavu'ot is linked to the old Ashkenazi practice of incorporating an Aramaic translation (<em>targum</em>) into the Torah reading on certain special occasions, including Shavu'ot. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_on_Megillah.24a.1.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot to Megillah 24a</a>.) Since the Targum used was broken up by utterance (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Machzor_Vitry%2C_Order_of_Shavuot.300.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machzor Vitri 300 and on</a>), they had to use <em>ta'am elyon</em> which also broke up the reading this way, as opposed to <em>ta'am tachton</em>, which combines some of the <em>dibberot</em> into one verse, and breaks others up into multiple verses. This happened specifically on Shavu'ot, when the Torah was read with the <em>targum</em>, and not at other times when the <em>aseret hadibberot</em> were read. (Incidentally, this also explain what Akdamut is - an Aramaic poem recited as a preface to reading the Aramaic <em>targum</em> on Shavuot. Nowadays, Ashkenazim have kept the preface while dropping the <em>targum</em>.)</p>\n<p>Finally, R. Soloveitchik (in the piece linked above) notes that his grandfather, R. Haim Soloveitchik, only ever used <em>ta'am tachton</em>, even on Shavu'ot, as he did not want to break up verses in a different way to (what he believed was) the authentic tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources for seeing the Exodus as metaphorical rather than historical\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently, someone who presents himself as a religious member of Jewish society told me that he feels it doesn't matter if the story of the Exodus actually happened, and can be viewed as a nice meaningful story meant to teach a lesson, not a fact. His exact words were this story is 'Meaningful, Serious, and Significant, but who cares if it actually happened'.</p>\n<p>When I disagreed, he stated my opinion was based on a lack of knowledge of opinions concerning what is fundamental to believe in this religion. He dismissed my own literal opinion as an <em>Oness</em> due to laziness of finding those said opinions, and told me not to worry about it. This is a seemingly intelligent person who when making a claim of sources, I cannot simply dismiss. However, the weight that our Torah put on the factual nature of this event and the duty incumbent upon us to Hashem based on this event makes it incomprehensible in my eyes to claim this event never took place.</p>\n<p>I cannot defend his opinion and I don't intend to, I am just trying to find out if I am missing something. The only leeway might be is turning the story into a non-literal read the way many have done with the first chapter(s) in Bereishis. Both these accounts are tied to Mitzvos of Zechira. Both these accounts are fundamentally connected to Shabbos and holidays. Yet only the creation account gets the imaginative treatment in society.</p>\n<p>So, are there any sources stating the Exodus can be viewed as solely metaphorical, as a 'meaningful story', rather than a historic event?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In K'tav Hitnatzlut, an apologetic letter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedaiah_ben_Abraham_Bedersi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yeda'ayah Ha'pnini</a> wrote as a reply to a cherem from the Rashbah on his philosophical views, he only makes a passing mention of Yetziat Mitzrayim, but it is included in his list of miracles that one should, on one hand, accept that they happened, but on the other hand, should not understand every detail of the story as p'shat, but rather as an allegory (to use <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/pilosof/ktav2-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Rashbah's angry words</a> \"and some of them say that all there is from the beginning of the Torah until the giving of the Torah at Sinai is an allegory and a riddle\") (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/pilosof/7-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">section 7</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ולפי זאת החלוקה אשר עשינוה ננהג כל מה שנמצאהו מפשוטי הכתובים בספרי הנבואה. וזה כי כל מה שיתלה בחוק המין הראשון מהעניינים היוצאים ממנהג הטבעי והרוח, נשאירם כולם על גלויים, מפני שהם אפשריים בחוק יכלת האל, והכרחיים עוד בחיזוק האמונה: כעניין המבול ודור הפלגה.\nוהצלחת האבות ופקידת האמהות ומופתי מצרים כולם...כל אלו והדומה להם ממה שלא הזדמן זכרונו מחייב כל אשר בשם זרע יעקב יכונה, שלא יחסר מפשוטיהם בשום פנים כחוט השערה. מפני התקבץ בהם שני העניינים הנזכרים שהם יסודות כל מופת. ועם היותם הכרחיים אצלנו בתורתנו עם היותם אפשריים בחוק יכלת ה'. ואמנם כל עת שנמצא בפשוטי הכתובים מה שיחסר ממנו החזק שבשני אלו, הוא שכלל במין השני מהנמנעות אז בודאי נפרשהו בדרך שיסכים אל האמת. וזה בכל מה שבא בספרי הנביאים, מזכור על האל אברים, ושיעור, ושכון במקום, והראתו לעיני בני אדם, ועלייתו וירידתו, והדומה לזה מכל מה שיחשב עליו הגשמה או שינוי בעצמו. וכן כל מה שבא עליו מהתארים המביא לחשוב עליו שום ריבוי או הדמות לברואיו...הכל יפורש בדרכים מועילים גם כן באמונה מוציאים הפשוטים ההם אל האמת אשר לא נאמרו בודאי אלא לשבר את האזן. כמאומרם הכללי הנכבד בזה העניין דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם. ובזה תצאנה האמונות נבררות, רצויות מן האל, מקרבות אותנו לאהבתו.\"</p>\n<p>\"And according to this division which we did, we shall divide all that we find in the simple portions of the texts in the books of prophecy. And this is all that will be considered of the first type, from the things that stand out from the natural course and of the spiritual, we shall leave them revealed, for they are possible in the rule of God's capabilities, and are needed in order to strengthen the faith: Such as with the generation of the flood and the generation of the splitting. And the deliverance of the fathers and the answering of the mothers and all the miracles of Egypt...all of these and those that are similar from what we did not recall, is incumbent upon all of the seed of Yaakov, that they shall not remove one bit of the simple understanding of these.

However, all that appears in the simple form of the texts that is missing the strong part of these two, is part of the second type of impossibilities, at which we shall agree to interpret it through the way of truth. And this is all that comes from the books of the prophets, that mentions for God limbs, and measurement, and residence in a place, and his appearing to humans, and His ascendance and descendance, and all that is similar to this from all that will be considered thinking upon Him a multiplicity or His similarity to His creations...everything shall be interpreted in wonderous ways also through faith, taking out the simple things which truthfully were surely only said in a way to make our ears understand. As they said the Torah spoke in the tongue of men. And from here the beliefs will come out clarified, wished upon from God, bringing us closer to His love.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first, it seems that Rabbi Yeda'ayah is merely rejecting the beliefs that Hashem is a physical entity, with \"דברה תורה בלשון בני אדם\", but he actually says more than that: When the Torah uses such terms, we must immediately seek out the deeper, allegorical meaning. In our case of Yetziat Mitzrayim, I believe that would include understanding the \"ויד ה' הויה\" - and the <strong>hand</strong> of Hashem struck\", the angel of Hashem that killed the first-born, Hashem hearing the cries of Bnei Yisrael, and possibly also how Hashem spoke to Moshe (and other prophets).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Nissim ben Moshe in \"Ma'aseh Nissim\" wrote on Sefer Shemot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ועניין הסנה שאיננו אוכל והוא בוער באש, וראית מלאך ה' בסנה - כל זה מהמין קראתיו \"אות\". והסנה משל לעם ישראל הבוער תמיד באש השעבוד ובשלהבת הצרות ובעבודת פרך...\"</p>\n<p>\"And what happened with the bush that it wasn't consumed and it is burning with fire, and the seeing of the angel of Hashem in the bush - all of this is of the type of a \"sign\". And the bush is a parable to the Nation of Yisrael who are constantly burning in the fire of the slavery and in the flame of the troubles and the hard work...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the footnotes, an \"אות\" or a \"sign\", as explained earlier in the book, is an imaginary occurrence, either in the mind or during a dream of the prophet and is not materially real.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואלה האותות השלשה שנעשו בין השם ית' למשה - כבר כתבנו שסובל היותם מהמין קראתיו \"אות\", או מהמין קראתיו בשם \"נס\".</p>\n<p>\"And these are the signs three that were between Hashem and Moshe - we already said that it can endure their being of the type of \"sign\", or from the type of \"miracle\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the footnote and further explaining in the book, the signs, when shown to Moshe, were only prophetic and didn't happen. When he showed them to Am Yisrael, they did actually happen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואמנם עניין צפורה, ואמרו (שמות ד' כד): ויהי בדרך במלון ויפגשהו ה' ויבקש המיתו\" - יש מי שפירש שבא חולי ורעדה ותמהון לבב למשה בהיותו נבוך בעניניו ואמר: אם אמול הבן בדרך, יסתבכן. ואם לא אמול אותו עד הגיענו למצרים ואחר המנוחה מעמל הדרך, יאמרו ישראל עלי: ראו זה בא להזהירנו על מצות השם...והוא בלתי נזהר...ועל זה נשאר משה טרוד המחשבות, נבהל הרעיונים, עד שהתעוררה צפורה למול הבן במלון ושילך משה יחידי למלאת שליחות השם ית'...אם כן, יהיה זה מהמין השני מהחלק השני.</p>\n<p>\"And that which happened with Tzipporah, and it is said (Shemot 4:24): \"At a night encampment on the way, the LORD encountered him and sought to kill him\" - there are those that explained that a sickness and a shiver and confusion of the heart befell Moshe from his nervousness in his dealings and saying: \"If I circumcise the child on the road, I will endanger him. And If I don't circumcise him until we reach Egypt and after we rest from the trip, Yisrael will say about me: See whom has come to warn us about the commandments of Hashem...and he isn't careful...and for this Moshe was troubled by his thoughts, until Tzipporah rose to circumcise their son at the encampment and that Moshe should go by himself to fulfill the mission of Hashem...and if so, this shall be from the second type of the second part.\" [Which is a strange occurrence that shouldn't be understood as pshat, i.e., not as a miracle]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואמרו...\"ולכל בני ישראל לא יחרץ כלב לשונו...\"...יש מי שפירש שרמז לכלב השמימיי, שממנו קטב מרירי...והנכון בעיני, שנאמר זה על בני האדם הרעים ובעלי לשון הרע...כי מרוב פחדם ויראתם בצאת בני ישראל ממצרים לא ימצא איש מצרי רשע רע שיקללם...\"</p>\n<p>\"And that which is said...\"but not a dog shall snarl at any of the Israelites...\"...there are those who explained that it is a hint to the heavenly dog, from which came the Ketev Meriri...and the correct explanation in my eyes, that it was said all those evil men and those who had an evil tongue...for out of great fear at the leaving of Bnei Yisrael from Egypt there could not be found an evil Egyptian man who would curse them...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, he brings a few different explanations for what happened at Yam Suf and tells the reader to choose whichever he likes best - but to be aware that these all fall under the category of \"מופת\" - uncommon things in nature with the wonderous part being the prophet's ability to predict these events.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is absolutely no source that I am aware of.</p>\n<p>There is a mitzvah to remember leaving Mitzrayim every day, and to reenact leaving Mitzrayim at the seder.

The Haggadah says if Hashem did not take us out of Mitzrayim, we would have never left. No commentary to the Gemarah, Halacha, or Haggadah I have ever seen remotely suggests that this is not literal.</p>\n<p>It is noticeable that the person in your story just claimed that \"there are opinions\" and made it your job to find them.

    "content": "# What is the official name for the \"additional readings\" on special torah-reading days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On certain special Shabboses, like the four parshiyot, there is a special torah reading that replaces Maftir after the weekly parsha is read.  Is there a name for this extra not-from-the-weekly-parsha Maftir reading?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have never heard of a name that refers specifically to the category of \"<em>maftir</em> readings that are not from the weekly <em>sedra</em>,\" and I do not believe that such a name exists. In my experience, such a reading is usually just referred to as a \"special <em>maftir</em> reading\" (as you mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67654/what-is-the-official-name-for-the-additional-readings-on-special-torah-reading#comment191273_67654\">your comment</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Addendum</h1>\n\n<p>I will try to clarify some of the confusion that has appeared in the comments on this post and answers about the word \"<em>maftir</em>\". The <em>maftir</em> is the person who reads the <em>haftarah</em>. Both words come from the same root (פ.ט.ר.‏). <em>Maftir</em> is the present-tense third-person form of the word in <em>binyan Hif'il</em>. I don't want to get too deep into a grammar lesson, but <em>Binyan Hif'il</em> is used for causative verbs (i.e. performing an action). The third-person present-tense <em>hif'il</em> verb form is also often used to refer to a person who performs that action, so that's why the person who reads the <em>haftarah</em> is called the <em>maftir</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The <em>maftir</em> is given the <em>aliya</em> before the <em>haftarah</em>. That <em>aliya</em> is therefore called the <em>maftir aliya</em> (which is sometimes abbreviated as simply <em>maftir</em>). Most <em>Shabbatot</em>, the <em>maftir aliya</em> is simply a repeat of the last few verses from that week's <em>sedra</em>; however, on certain special <em>Shabbatot</em> (e.g. the Four <em>Parshiot</em>) as well as holidays there is a \"special <em>maftir</em>\" from a completely different part of the Torah. That is the reading that your quesiton asks about and for which I do not believe there is any special name.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think you may be confused regarding the term \"maftir\" and how it works.</p>\n\n<p>\"Maftir\" refers to the \"additional\" aliyah that occurs after the other 7 required aliyot on Shabbat. There is always a maftir, so there is no <strong>additional</strong> maftir. It is merely that one maftir is substituted in place of the standard weekly maftir.</p>\n\n<p>Some people call the Haftarah \"maftir\". The word \"maftir\" refers to the last reading from the Torah, whereas \"haftarah\" refers to the reading from the prophets. The person who reads the haftarah receives the maftir aliyah.</p>\n\n<p>On mincha of fast days and Tish'a B'av morning, the \"maftir\" aliyah is not an extra one, but rather is the 3rd aliyah. That's the only exception to not adding an extra one as we have on Shabbat and Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you hear someone say \"I have maftir Yonah\" if he is reading that section on Yom Kippur afternoon. That's become parlance, I suppose, but as I explained above, he should say, \"I have haftarah Yonah\".</p>\n\n\n",

Only the altar in the Temple\noffers asylum and he took hold of the altar in Shilo. He made one\nfinal mistake. The altar protects only the kohain in the midst of his\nservice, whereas Yoav was not of the priestly family (Makos 12a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that he may have thought that King Solomon would not dare have human blood spilled at the altar, but this is only speculation on my part.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Exodus 21:14 (Sefaria):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכִֽי־יָזִ֥ד אִ֛ישׁ עַל־רֵעֵ֖הוּ לְהָרְג֣וֹ בְעָרְמָ֑ה מֵעִ֣ם\n  מִזְבְּחִ֔י תִּקָּחֶ֖נּוּ לָמֽוּת׃ (ס)</p>\n  \n  <p>And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with\n  guile; thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ha'emek Davar commentary citing Ramba\"m states that if there is no warning or sighting of the murder, a person may be considered an unintentional killer. Prior to the designation of refuge cities, the alter was considered the place of refuge. It's possible that Yo'av may have thought that he was in this category, and was seeking refuge this way.

Essentially, he didn't realise that it did not help to hold the horns of the altar because he killed on purpose and with deceit. And it was wrong to assume that it would offer him a sanctuary as the king is able to punish the people with the most severe punishments of the Torah. And finally:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גם לא היה מועיל ליואב אחוז בקרנות המזבח כי לא היה כהן ועבודה בידו אבל ראוי שנלמד מזה שזאת החזקה בקרנו' המזבח היתה מועילה לו שלא ימסרוהו למלך להמיתו אם לא היה מחוייב מיתה בב''ד</p>\n<p>Also, it did not help Yoav to hold the horns of the altar because he was not a Kohen and the avoda (the service) was in his hand.

He would be removed even from the Holy Altar in the Temple and convicted. We know this from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 21:14</a>; <strong>\"If someone kills a person deliberately, using subterfuge, you shall even remove him from My Altar to apply the death penalty to him.” We find that this is precisely what happened to Yoav, David’s commander-in-chief, who held on to the corners of the Altar in order to escape prosecution for murder (Kings I 2,28).

    "content": "# Was the universe created by soundwaves?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Was the universe created by soundwaves?</p>\n\n<p>Hashem said in Genesis: Let there be light.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Hashem is the master of existence and in essence, existence itself. He can manipulate any aspect of the world.  </p>\n\n<p>Soundwaves are one aspect of physical existence, and as far as I know, they can only travel through a physical medium. So if we were to simply take your question at face value without any further assumptions, it wouldn't make sense for sound to create matter, since it can only manifest itself through an existing medium. </p>\n\n<p>My own opinion on the matter is that, unfortunately, it's unlikely that we could understand exactly how the world was created. At least, not in our current state. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You seem to be basing your supposition that the universe may have been created by sound waves on the fact that Gensis 1:3 has \"ויאמר אלקים\", literally \"God said\". While I don't claim to understand what that means precisely, it doesn't seem to involve sound waves. Allow me to quote some of the commentary on that phrase, in my own loose translation:</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <em>gaon</em> says that \"said\" means \"willed\". If that were so, it should say \"[ויאמר אלקים] that there be light\" [as opposed to what it says, \"ויאמר אלקים 'let there be light'\"].… Its meaning is that it's a reference to action without effort, analogous to a king [speaking to] his servants [and thereby acting].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nachmanides:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ויאמר\" here refers to desire… that that was His desire. Alternatively, it's akin to thought… meaning to say that it was not with effort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. <a href=\"/q/67382\">B'chaye</a> b. Asher:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ויאמר\" refers to desire…. Alternatively, \"ויאמר\" means \"decreed\"….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To address Gabriel12, I hope this helps as a scientist/professor was able to explain it this way to me:</p>\n\n<p>E=MC2 (squared)</p>\n\n<p>Energy = MASS x the SPEED OF LIGHT2</p>\n\n<p>Mass is made up of Matter.\nMatter is made up of Atoms/Electrons/Protons/Neutrons.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the STRING THEORY (quantum physics) comes into play...\nThe String Theory is hoping to show that these strings (a.k.a. superstrings) are reverberation of sound. </p>\n\n<p>If this is proven, then Matter/Mass cannot exist without the reverberation of sound.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, where did the sound come from? </p>\n\n<p>Hashem SAID ... in Genesis 1: Let there be light</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>I then asked a quantum physicist the same question, \"Where did the sound come from?\" He answered, \"Light.\"</p>\n\n<p>I then asked him where did the light come from and he laughed and said, \"No one knows the answer to that.\" </p>\n\n<p>However, Hashem \"SAID\" qualifies for the reverberation of sound that would create the superstrings of quantum physics to create Atoms to create matter that would manifest itself as mass.</p>\n\n<p>For more scientific explanation, \"Michio Kaku explains String Theory,\" gives a more indepth view.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps! </p>\n\n\n",

Nusach Ashkenaz is wrapped inwards towards oneself, one on the upper arm, seven on the forearm, shin on the hand, three wraps on middle finger.

I have only ever seen the standard white ashkenazi atarah (neck/head piece).</p>\n\n<p>Tzitzis: The strings themselves once again are tied exactly like Nusach Ashkenaz however where it adjoins the garment, rather than having one hole like ashkenazim, there are two holes (a tzeirei) that are flat unlike that of Chabad which are diagonal. This is not done on the tallis because it would appear haughty but the Mishna Berurah (11:39) allows it on a tallis kottn because it is not worn quite so publicly.</p>\n\n<p>The nusach for the siddur is nusach S'fard which was introduced by the Ari. This is very slightly different to Nusach Ari, the Chabad nusach, which is the Alter Rebbe's version of Nusach S'fard.</p>\n\n<p>I am still researching Gerrer minhogim with the desire to reconnect with the Yiddishkeit of my great grandparents.

All the prohibitions  of non-sexual contact are bounded to a sexual risk.\nThe Gemara Shabbat says about prohibited period (nidda).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(But he is self-contradictory, for) 'Ulla said, Even any form of intimacy is forbidden,because we say, 'Take a circuitous route, O nazirite, but do not approach the vineyard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But your question addresses contact with a not niddah woman who  is not prohibited as Arayos, e.g. a celibate, unrelated...  etc. What is the kind of this problem?</p>\n<h3>See in Rambam</h3>\n<p>Sefer Nashim Hilchoss Ishus Perek 1 Halacha 4</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace, and he and she desired, he could give her payment, engage in relations with her wherever they desired, and then depart. Such a woman is referred to as a harlot.\nWhen the Torah was given, [relations with] a harlot became forbidden, as [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: \"There shall not be a harlot among the children of Israel.\" <strong>Therefore, a person who has relations with a woman for the sake of lust, without kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because he had relations with a harlot</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding concubinage, Rambam Melachim 4.4.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, he (the King) may take wives and concubines from the entire territory of Eretz Yisrael. The term 'wives' implies women who were married with A ketubah and kiddushin; concubines, women who were not given A ketubah and kiddushin. With the act of yichud alone, the king acquires her and relations with her are permitted him. <strong>A commoner is forbidden to have a concubine</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the Ramban in teshuva, quoted in Kesef Mishne Ishut 1.4 and in Abudarham, Hilchot Berachot, Birkat Erusin says that a commoner is allowed to have a concubine.  Further the Ramban concludes that despite he holds that there is no prohibition for a commoner, he cannot take a concubine because this will lead them to sexual intercourse in the Nidda period.</p>\n<p>If the woman is potentially permitted (neither erva nor nidda)  a non sexual touching is allowed deorayta.  But there is a problem with touching sexually oriented, even looking and speaking. We need to read this Gemara  Sanhedrin 75a, wich is ruled by great Rishonim (Rambam, Rosh).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rab Judah said in Rab's name: A man once conceived a passion for a certain woman, and his heart was consumed by his burning desire [his life being endangered thereby].\nWhen the doctors were consulted, they said, 'His only cure is that she shall submit.'\nThereupon the Sages said: 'Let him die rather than that she should yield.'\nThen [said the doctors]; 'let her stand nude before him;' [they answered] 'sooner let him die'.'\nThen', said the doctors, 'let her converse with him from behind a fence'.'\nLet him die,' the Sages replied 'rather than she should converse with him from behind a fence.'\nNow R' Jacob B'Idi and R'Samuel B'Nahmani dispute therein.\nOne said that she was a married woman; the other that she was unmarried.\nNow, this is intelligible on the view, that she was a married woman, but on the latter, that she was unmarried, why such severity? - R'Papa said: Because of the disgrace to her family.\nR'Aha the son of R'Ika said: That the daughters of Israel may not be immorally dissolute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam concludes hallachically (Mada,  Yesode Hatorah 5, 9; reported in Bet Yosef YD 157, but not in SA). Bet Yosef understood that Rambam ruled that despite the rule to be lenient for a doubt about a question that has a lethal issue (the doubt is if the prohibition regards also an unmarried woman), since the stringency is to do nothing, not an act (to leave the man ill is not an action), we need to be stringent. The Rosh ruled as Rambam {anyways in Shulchan Aruch Poskim did not report this rule concerning an unmarried woman as @mevaqesh enlighted. They did not state the prohibition to heal up a life threatened man with looking or speaking with a unmarried woman, but they don't allow at all to make this overall}:</p>\n<p>Here is a translation of the Rambam.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[When] someone becomes attracted to a woman and is [love-]sick [to the extent that] he is in danger of dying, [although] the physicians say he has no remedy except engaging in sexual relations with her, he should be allowed to die rather than engage in sexual relations with her. [This applies] even if she is unmarried.\nHe is even not to be given instructions to speak to her [in private] behind a fence. Rather, he should die rather than be given instructions to speak to her behind a fence. [These restrictions were instituted] so that Jewish women would not be regarded capriciously, and [to prevent] these matters from [ultimately] leading to promiscuity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Chachamim prohibited very strongly a very light kind of contact when it is motivated by sexual drive.</h3>\n\n\n",

Moshe Feinstein in Iggerot Moshe E.H. 1:114 states that even though one may not daven (which includes any bracha or reciting Torah, etc.) opposite the walls of a <em>bet hakiseh</em>, the walls of today's bathrooms are considered walls of the house / building and not the bathroom. the same status would apply to the bathroom door. Therefore, he states that one may recite brachot opposite the bathroom even when the door is open. Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank (Har Tzvi O.C. 1:48) reached a similar conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>If you read the rest if the article, there is a discussion if current bathrooms even obtain a status of the <em>bet hakiseh</em> altogether, which may make your question irrelevant.

The main one has a professional chazzan. We begin Shabbat services at 9 am and are done between 11:30 and noon which includes approx. a 15 minute Rabbi's sermon. Most shuls in my neighborhood start at 9a and finish by 11:30, so it seems that 2.5 hours is the common service length.</p>\n\n<p>In the adjoining building to our shul, they begin at 9 and are done about 10:30 including the rabbi's sermon.</p>\n\n<p>People in my shul say \"the other minyan davens too fast.\" Some others who attend other shuls in my neighborhood who end at 11:30 say that if we end at noon, we are davening too slowly.</p>\n\n<p>My argument is that the speed doesn't matter, and there is no such thing as \"fast\" or slow\" providing that the chazzan and Torah readers pronounce each word clearly and don't omit, slur or \"swallow\" the words. It is possible to say a \"fast\" Amidah yet pronounce each word quickly.</p>\n\n<p>I think that I am correct in my thinking, but I'm wondering if there are any halachot or Rabbinical <em>teshuvot</em> that have a suggested amount of time that certain sections of the davening should take?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When reciting prayers, beyond saying the words clearly, <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kavana_During_Brachot\" rel=\"nofollow\">one should maintain focus on the words he is saying</a>. Different people have different preferences about this. For some, it is hard to maintain concentration for a long period of time so they prefer to say the words somewhat faster. For others, it is easier to concentrate if they slow down and take a lot of time to think about the words.</p>\n\n<p>I strongly suspect that when your co-congregants say that some <em>shul</em> or another is <em>davening</em> \"too fast\" or \"too slow,\" they are expressing their personal preference rather than making a <em>halakhic</em> statement.

    "content": "# Is there a concept of \"bitul beshishim\" with regards to fish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Years ago, some brands of Worcestershire sauce as well as a few salad dressings were marked \"OU fish\". This meant that one was not allowed to use this sauce on a piece of meat or have it on the same plate with meat. Apparently, the Worcestershire sauce contained a trace of anchovies. The salad dressing had a trace of salmon or some other type of fish.</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn't the trace amount of fish in the sauce or salad dressing be nullified by the less than 1/60 (bitul beshishim) rule that similarly applies to mixtures of meat and dairy? Also, the meat with fish is a minhag which seems less stringent than the meat with dairy concern. Why would there be a concern, then regarding using the sauce or dressing with meat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>As always, the answer is: \"it's a machlokes!\"</p>\n\n<p>Open up a Shulchan Aruch to Yoreh Deah 116:2, where it says not to mix meat and fish.</p>\n\n<p>The Taz's opinion is that because meat-and-fish is a health concern, we are stricter about it than normal kashrus prohibitions, therefore if you pour one ounce of fish juice into a hundred ounces of beef broth, you may not eat it.</p>\n\n<p>The Nekudos HaKesef (written by his buddy, the Shach, and his son) argues. If the Talmud never gave any different guidance (as it does for all sorts of things that \"aren't even <em>batel</em> in a thousand\"), we default to the <em>batel</em>-by-60 policy. Okay, actual <em>venom</em> is not <em>batel</em>, but it never said anywhere that fish-with-meat is quite that dangerous!</p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, we tend to follow the Shach (& co.) over the Taz in situations like this. And that's the OU's position.</p>\n\n<p>Next time you go to the supermarket, take a careful look: the name-brand Worcestershire sauce is marked OU-Fish, while the generic brand is not. Both contain anchovies. The former has more than 1.6% anchovies by volume (i.e. is not <em>batel</em>), the latter does not. </p>\n\n<p>Some Chasidim, however, follow the Taz's opinion. Tropicana makes (or at least made?) an orange juice with \"extra Omega-3\" derived from fish oil. It's marked <em>OK-Fish.</em> The OK put out a statement that the fish content is nowhere <em>near</em> 1.6% by volume so it's totally <em>batel</em>; however, the <em>Fish</em> warning is for those who follow the Taz's stringency that fish is not <em>batel</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Bittul b'shishim only works when the ingredient is not essential to making the thing and is not intentionally added.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Obviously, intentionally adding an ingredient to a product is because it adds a beneficial flavor. \"Notain ta'am lishvach'. In which case the concept of nullification by 1/60th is not applicable. The original intent was to indicate insignificance if the dilution occurred accidentally. \nThe question posed earlier whether one would eat a dish that had less than 1/60th of poison added to it would depend on whether the poison would make one ill  (or dead) and whether it added a beneficial flavor.</p>\n\n\n",

However, seen in context he must be adding  something else.</p>I humbly suggest that he understands magic to be part of a non-holistic vision of reality, where shortcuts and simple solutions are used to make your way through the world. Thus he ends the Halacha with:</p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלו הדברים שאסרה תורה אינם דברי חכמה אלא תהו והבל שנמשכו בהן חסרי הדעת ונטשו כל דרכי האמת בגללן ומפני זה אמרה תורה כשהזהירה על כל אלו ההבלים <strong>תמים תהיה עם ה' אלהיך</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p> He describes these things as Tohu, chaotic, non-holistic/non-scientific, and thereby are approaches which destroy all paths of reality. People with simple minds get drawn into this, he says, because they aren't connected to a Temimus and wholesomeness which focuses a person on the bigger picture. It's like buying into some new-age treatment you read about online because \"This has worked on 100 people!\". A person on the path of Truth and reality doesn't involve himself in things which are disconnected from the universal functionality of the world; he doesn't look for shortcuts to getting all your prayers answered, for having all your wishes fulfilled by rubbing the genie's bottle. Rather, he lives life on its' own terms, and looks to the patterns of Creation as expression of a reality which God wishes to share with us.</p>\n\n\n",

However, Sifre Bamidbar (Parshat Shelach, והיה לכם לציצית) Shammai and Hillel are cited with Shammai holding that <strong>three strings plus one of techeilet are necessary</strong> and Hillel holding that <strong>only three total are required</strong> (these positions are reversed in the Gemara, Menachot 39 or 40). </p>\n\n<p>How do we reconcile the opinions of Shammai and the Ba'alei Tosefot, considering their apparent exclusivity? Is Shammai's shitta for techeilet a minimum, or an absolute requirement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You cite the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34328&st=&pgnum=48\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sifre Bamidbar 115</a> which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועשו להם ציצית שומע אני יעשה חוט אחד בפני עצמו ת\"ל גדילים מכמה גדילים אתה עושה אין פחות משלשה דברי בית הלל <strong>ובית שמאי אומרים שלשה של צמר ורביעית של תכלת</strong> והלכה כבית שמאי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But if you look at the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34328&st=&pgnum=167&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sifre Devarim 234</a>, the other place in the Torah that talks about Tzitzit, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גדילים תעשה לך, למה נאמר לפי שנאמר ועשו להם ציצית שומע אני יעשה חוט אחד בפני עצמו תלמוד לומר גדילים כמה גדילים נעשים אין פחות משלשה חוטים כדברי בית הלל <strong>בית שמאי אומרים מארבעה חוטים של תכלת וארבעה חוטים של לבן</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there you have it. Two versions about what Beit Shammai said.</p>\n\n<p>(I'll note while I'm here that the Devarim version is <em>weird</em> because it switches between speaking of numbers of half-strings and whole strings, it's not clear how many blue strings Beit Hillel needs, and Beit Shammai doesn't appear to be expounding on any particular word in the verse. Indeed, the Gra there strikes the Girsa in Devarim replacing it with that of Bamidbar (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31533&st=&pgnum=193\" rel=\"nofollow\">and ruling that 1/4 needs to be blue</a>), and it's not hard for us to speculate that this derives from a scribe changing ג' של לבן וד' של תכלת to ד' של לבן וד' של תכלת because he didn't realize ד was intended to mean \"fourth\" not \"four\". See <a href=\"http://gush.net/dk/5770/1219maamar2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for more.)</p>\n\n\n",

But why did he not say, 'This is forbidden'?

(h/t to Fred)</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, the major source of discussion is Ran to Rif Shabbos 39b, who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא ודאי לישנא דיהא בנדוי היינו לומר שראוי לנדותו והיינו דפרכינן הכא ולימא אסור כלומר ובהכי משמע שראוי לנדותו שכך הוא המדה בכל האיסורים שהעובר עליהן ראוי לנדותו ופרקינן דנקט כי האי לישנא לאשמועינן שאיסורו יותר מפני שמגרה יצה\"ר בעצמו:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"Chavrusa\" Gemara and Shu\"t Amudei Eish understands this Ran that it is more Chamur to say Nidui than to say Assur, and that Issur is included in Nidui, nit that it is only a Niddui and No Issur.

Some (see Divrei Chamudos here in Niddah and others) say that he doesn't even consider someone to be in Nidui unless they are actually Motzi Zera Levatalah, although I believe that everyone holds that it is Assur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Tomer Devorah <a href=\"http://www.digital-brilliance.com/kab/deborah/chap8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch.8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now, just as the Supernal Bow is never stretched except it be toward\n  this target, so, too, man should not stretch his bow and allow himself\n  and erection under any circumstances except it be for the proper\n  purpose, namely, for his wife when she is clean, which is the time of\n  union.

    "content": "# If you put up a mezuzah before 30 days, can you make a blessing?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am referring above all to mezuzahs placed on rented spaces in the Diaspora before 30 days have elapsed. In the case of a rented space outside Eretz Yisroel, mezuzah does not become an obligation until 30 days have elapsed from when one moves in. Therefore, one customarily would not say a bracha if affixing the mezuzot before 30 days. (Source: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/132/1516\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/132/1516</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>From that source: \"If one wishes to affix the Mezuzah but delay recitation of the blessing until the thirtieth day, it should be touched before reciting the blessing. However, it is preferable to remove and reaffix the Mezuzah before reciting the blessing.\" Note that this does not indicate whether it would be /permissible/ to make a blessing if affixing before the 30 days. Furthermore, there are some sources ( <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/05/30/mezuzah-before-thirty-days/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://dinonline.org/2011/05/30/mezuzah-before-thirty-days/</a> ) which suggest that mezuze is an obligation before 30 days if one plans to stay there longer. This would imply that a blessing could be made--although again they are not explicit.</p>\n\n<p>What is the answer? Can one make a blessing when putting up a mezuzah before 30 days on a rental outside Eretz Yisroel? (Assume one will be living there long-term.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question is interesting in that you ask \"can one make a blessing when putting up a mezuzah before 30 days...\" There seems to be conflicting opinions on this idea. The situation of delaying a blessing usually applies if you don't know how long you're renting for and are concerned you will be living there LESS than 30 days. But if you have a set lease for more than 30 days (and will be living there long term) then according to Chacham Ovadia Yosef and the Ben Ish Chai (two large Sephardic Poskim), you should affix the mezuzah as soon as possible without a b'racha. </p>\n\n<p>However i don't think your link, or the link below with the words of Ovadia Yosef and the Ben Ish Chai forbid someone from saying a b'racha within 30 days. Just that ideally you should wait. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=597\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=597</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I wrote this up as a question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66555/does-one-really-have-30-days-to-put-up-a-mezuza-outside-eretz-israel\">here</a> although it is not an exact duplicate.

Unlike the modern favorite of \"<em>frum</em>\", the implications of <em>ehrlich</em> revolve more around those <em>mitzvos</em> related to honesty, kindness, in addition to meaning observant as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>“<em>Frum</em>” descends from the German “<em>fromm</em>“, meaning pious or devout. In pre-war Yiddish, usage appears to have varied widely. On the one hand, those who named their daughters “Fruma” clearly thought being <em>frum</em> as complementary. On the other, there was an idiom, or as Rav Aharon Kotler often put it, “<em>Frum iz a galech; ehrlich iz a Id</em> — the town priest is ‘pious’, a Jew is refined.” I also heard the first part from grandparents of that same generation, “<em>frum iz a galech</em>“.  Admittedly, both data points are from Lithuanian Iddish. (In Lithuanian dialect, the language is called אידיש not יידיש; similarly you may have seen in the quote from R' Aharon -- a Jew is א איד, not א ייד.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I think \"<em>ehrlach</em>\" and \"<em>ehrlachkeit</em>\" are what you are looking for. At least for this sentence, and hopefully as a life-goal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps the term <strong>chassid</strong> would also be appropriate. I'm not talking about its meaning as used today, which tends to mean a person with a long beard, payot, and wearing some type of black robe and a shtreimel on Shabbat and Yom Tov, etc. I'm talking about its original meaning as used in many places in the Mishnah and Gemarah. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pirkei Avot 5:10 and 11</a> as examples. One says that someone who says \"What's mine is yours and what's yours is yours\" is a Chassid. Another says that someone who does not get angry easily and is easily appeased is also a chassid.</p>\n\n<p>If this rav, demonstrates such behavior, which I hope he does, calling him a chassid is a huge compliment. </p>\n\n\n",

This is the case even though the word is not the last in the verse: because the last word, 'הֵֽם', is a very short word, it somehow doesn't count as a separation between יִשְׁפּוּט֥וּ and the end of the verse. This case also differs from regular pausal usage in that the long vowel that is put in is a shuruk: one would expect the non-pausal form 'yishpetu' to become 'yishpotu', with a holam.</p>\n\n<p>(A pausal form is a form that a word takes when it occurs at the end of a verse or at the end of a phrase, i.e., a place where a reader would pause slightly. Usually the change that occurs is that a short vowel becomes a long vowel, for example 'יכתבו / yikhtevu' becoming 'יכתובו / yikhtovu'.)</p>\n\n<p>Shadal then goes on to disagree with ibn Ezra's application of this explanation to a few other specific instances in the Bible of verbs getting an unusual long vowel. I think that Shadal accepts ibn Ezra's explanation here, though, and lets that stand as the answer to the question of the unusual form of יִשְׁפּוּט֥וּ.</p>\n\n\n",

In issur dabuk, there is no such limit. This is the principle in 2 words. <br/>I remember that there is in Bach something from Raaviah about this<sup>1</sup>.<br/>\nHere are some words from Rabeinu Yerucham netiv 15 - 3 (copied from the Kovets Shitot Kamai):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על גב דאמרינן חתיכה עצמה נעשית נבלה,\nלא אמרינן כיון דאוסר כדי קליפה או נבלה, אותה קליפה נעשית נבילה\nוחוזרת ואוסרת כל קליפה שאצלה וכן כל קליפה וקליפה\nדלא אמרינן חתיכה עצמה נעשית נבילה ורואין ההיתר כאילו הוא אסור\nאלא כשהאיסור מתפשט במקום שהולך החתיכה אבל בכאן אין האיסור מתפשט אלא כדי קליפה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the first explanation, the part of the piece penetrated by the Isur don't prohibit the near part, because the absorbed issur doesn't diffuse deeper.</p>\n<p>He give also a second explanation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש מפרשים\nשאין אומרים חתיכה עצמה נעשית נבילה אלא כשהיא עומדת בפני עצמה\nאבל כאן שהקליפה מחוברת עם הירך אינה נעשית נבלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no Chanan but for a separate entity (an entire piece).<br/>\nI hope this make sense. See Shach YD 22 SK10 who quotes Rabenu Yerucham.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n<p>See Chulin 76.2 Tosfot paragraph \"Afilu Meresh Ozno\", the two explanations are there, <strong>Rabbi Eliezer Mimets</strong> holds that is no CHanan for a no entire piece, <strong>the author of the Tosfot</strong> holds that the first Isur cannot penetrate more than the Kelipa, so, there is no Chanan. But according to <strong>Rabenu Efrayim</strong>, I understand that the both explanations may be wrong. E.g. if there is a Kelipa of Basar Bechalav, this Klipa maybe Nevela according to Rabenu Efrayim and it can prohibit the last part of the piece.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>  <b>Bach YD 92</b>   <strong>ולא אמרינן חתיכה עצמה נעשה נבלה עד מקום שנבלע עכ\"ל ראבי\"ה</strong> ונ\"ל דהיינו כרא\"ם שפי' בפג\"ה דלא אמרינן חתיכה עצמה נעשה נבלה בחצי חתיכה עכ\"ל מרדכי פכ\"ה מדפי' דאין מקצתה שחוץ לרוטב נ\"נ ואוסרת את השאר אלמא דמפרש לרש\"י הא דתנן אם יש בנ\"ט באותה חתיכה דר\"ל באותה מקצת חתיכה שחוץ לרוטב יש בה בנ\"ט אסור אבל אינו אוסר את השאר ודו\"ק:‏</p>\n<p>Translation: and it is not said that the piece itself up to the level where it absorbed became Nevela, quotation from the Raaviah.  I think this corresponds to what REM said in the chapter Gid Hanashe that you don't say Chanan for half a piece.  These are the words of the Mordechai in the Kol Habasar chapter. <em>(Note that the Tosfot in 96b distinguishes between this explanation and the REM explanation)</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

When an eagle nests on the ledge\n  of a sheer-walled canyon, many feet above the earth, with no jutting\n  tree or protruding rock to break the fall, the quick movement of a\n  mother bird to offer her own back to a frightened fledgling may be the\n  only way to let it live to try its wings again.\" (V.C.

He could support the belief that the\n  parent birds, after urging and sometimes shoving the youngster into\n  the air, will swoop underneath and rest the struggler for a moment on\n  their wings and back. ... Our guide, when questioned, said that every\n  phrase of the verse [Deut. xxxii, I I] (which was new to him) was\n  accurate, save the first; he had seen it all except the stirring up of\n  the nest.\" (W.B. Thomas, Yeoman's England [1934], pp. 135-6)</p>\n  \n  <p>Another report concerning the golden eagle comes from Arthur Cleveland\n  Bent, one of America's greatest ornithologists, on the authority of\n  Dr. L. Miller:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"The mother started from the nest in the crags and, roughly hand-ling the youngster, she allowed him to drop, I should say, about\n  ninety feet; then she would swoop down under him, wings spread, and he\n  would alight on her back. She would soar to the top of the range with\n  him and repeat the process. Once perhaps she waited fifteen minutes\n  between flights. I should say the farthest she let him fall was a\n  hundred and fifty feet. My father and I watched him, spellbound, for\n  over an hour.\" (A. C.

If yes, then why is she called \"Moses' wife\" if she is not actually his wife any more?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your connection is exactly what the Malbim discusses, I copied the relevant part here (partial emphasis by me):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וישמע יתרו.</strong> בא להציע מה הניע את לב יתרו לצאת ממדין אל המדבר ולהביא את בניו אתו, שהלא מנמוסי הכבוד היה ראוי שמשה ישחר פני חותנו והוא ישלח אחר אשתו, כמ\"ש דרכו של איש לחזר אחר אשה לא בהפך שנקבה תסובב גבר, זאת שנית הלא משה שלח את אשתו <strong>בגט פטורין</strong>, כמ\"ש אחר שלוחיה ות\"א בתר דפטרה, שזה תרגום של שלוח בגט או שלוח עבד בגט שחרור, וכלל בלשון שלשון שלוח בבנין הכבד אצל אשה מציין גירושין בכ\"מ, וכ\"כ בילקוט שגרשה בגט פטורין, ואיך הכניע א\"ע להביא לו אשתו ששלחה ונפרדה מאתו...‏\n  <br>...\n  <br><strong>ויקח יתרו... אחר שלוחיה</strong>. הגם ששלח אותה ונפרד ממנה לא חש לזה, כי לא עשה זה בעבור שמאס בה, כי היא עדיין <strong>אשת משה</strong> גם <strong>אחר שלוחיה</strong>, כי לא נפרד ממנה רק לפי שעה עד יפקוד ה' עמו כנ\"ל.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, the Malbim does indeed say that Moses divorced Tzipporah, and that \"שלח\" is indeed mostly used for divorce (he brings proof from Onkelos, and the Yalkut, and his own opinion).\nSo he explains that she is still called \"אשת משה\" because he only divorced and left her temporarily, not because he didn't want her as his wife.</p>\n\n<p>(Also Ba'al HaTurim says that she is still called his wife, just like no one marries a king's divorced wife.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How would the splitting of the sea have been done with magic if magic is just trickery?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the spirit of the recent Mi Yodeya discussion of the Rambam's view of magic, a question that has bothered me for some time:</p>\n<p>The Rambam ostensibly doesn't accept that there is any reality to magic, everything is done through slight of hand and trickery, and the Torah's prohibition is against exactly that trickery. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/13696/4794\">here</a> for more on that.)</p>\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1108.htm#1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yesodei HaTorah 8:1</a> the Rambam writes that Moshe would not have been relied upon absolutely due to any of the wonders he performed, because they could have been done through magic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משה רבינו לא האמינו בו ישראל מפני האותות שעשה. שהמאמין על פי האותות יש בלבו דופי שאפשר שיעשה האות בלט וכשוף.</p>\n<p>The Jewish people did not believe in Moshe Rabbeinu as a result of the wonders that he performed, for one who believes according to wonders always has some doubt in his heart, maybe it was done through magic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam then procedes to give examples of some of those miracles which were not done to produce belief. All the examples seem difficult to pull off as a slight-of-hand trick, but here's just one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה צריך להשקיע את המצריים קרע את הים והצלילן בתוכו</p>\n<p>He needed to drown the Egyptians, so he split the sea and sunk them in it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If magic is fake, how could these things have possibly been performed through \"magic\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The idea is not that we can reproduce the trick. The idea is that people have accomplished great things which we thought were impossible, and perhaps he did this with trickery and I have no idea how — yet. People have managed to hide bridges.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam was not using קריאת ים סוף for an example of what we could do with trickery. He is mentioning it after establishing that miracles in general are not solid enough evidence, and that they are done out of necessity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>it says there was a wind there all night. so people could somehow pretend to use magic but really the wind pulled it off.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Joseph Albo's formulation of this argument (Sefer HaIkarim 1:18) is worded slightly differently, which may help address the question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly the performance of miracles is doubtful as a test, <strong>for something like them may be performed by some natural science or device</strong>.</p>\n<p>(Husik translation, Vol. I p. 161; my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shortly thereafter he identifies this as Rambam's argument mentioned in the question here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the meaning of the words of Maimonides in the book \"Madda'\" in the eighth chapter of the treatise on the <em>Foundations of the Torah</em>.</p>\n<p>(Husik translation, Vol. I p. 162)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then he restates it again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>all these things are not essential proofs of prophecy, for one may foretell the future through astrologers or by means of familiar spirits. Some of the miracles could be performed for good and pious men who are not prophets, like Rabbi Hanina the son of Dosa, Rabbi Phinehas the son of Yair, and his associates; <strong>or they might be performed by means of natural devices</strong>, as the rabbis say concerning Hezekiah, the king of Judah, that Ahaz his father caused him to pass through the fire, and yet he was saved, because his mother anointed him with oil of the salamander; or they might be performed by magic and sorcery, as the magicians of Egypt did, or by means of one of the sacred names of God. The divine names are like His instruments, having the virtue of performing miracles.</p>\n<p>(Husik translation Vol. I p. 163-164; my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So when Rambam said  שאפשר שיעשה האות בלט וכשוף, it may simply be an inclusive phrase for \"things non-miraculous\". Alternatively, he may have meant that <em>the people</em> would think it was magic. This indeed seems to be the simple reading of המאמין על פי האותות יש בלבו דופי.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20102&st=&pgnum=103\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kallah Rabbati 1:3</a>, Ketubbot 7a) derives this requirement from Boaz (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2904.htm#2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ruth 4:2</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Although a Minyan is require to recite the full Sheva Berachot, the Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7687\" rel=\"noreferrer\">EH 62:4</a>) rules that a Minyan is not required to say the blessing \"Asher Bara\" which is added to all the groom's meals, according to the Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7688\" rel=\"noreferrer\">:7</a>), and to all of his meals that are not just with family (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7688\" rel=\"noreferrer\">:7</a>) that have a Zimmun (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7687\" rel=\"noreferrer\">:4</a>), according to the Rama.

It is not connected to Sheva Berachot at all. That said, the longstanding custom is to only recite it during the first 7 days of marriage for a first marriage, and during the first 3 days for a second marriage, when the obligation to be happy is especially strong (ibid.).</p>\n\n<p>(Some communities customarily recite a poem before the Zimmun, such as \"Nodeh LeShimcha\" or \"Davay Haser\". The Beit Shemuel (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7688\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sk 11</a>) thinks that the latter should be used if all 7 blessings are being recited, but if only the one is being said, then the former poem is to be preferred.)</p>\n\n<p>If you have 7 men at this meal, and you presumably have some guests, then you would say the special Zimmun and the blessing \"Asher Bara\" afterwards and be thankful for the opportunity to celebrate with the bride and groom in an intimate setting.

In other words, the <em>second</em> half of every verse modifies the <em>first</em> half of every verse (with minor exceptions for example among verses containing genealogies). Wickes calls these verse divisions the logical and syntactical function of dichotomy by cantillation.

The <strong>second</strong> verb-object comprises the main thought of the second half of the verse. In other words, each of the two verb-objects is amplified by what follows in each respective half of each verse.

    "title": "Meaning of \"emunah shlaima\"?",
    "content": "# Meaning of \"emunah shlaima\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam's 13 Articles of Faith begin with the statement:  \"אני מאמין באמונה שלמה\" - \"I believe with complete faith...\", words that then go on to express our faith that God \"creates and guides\" all creatures, that \"all of the words of the prophets are true,\" that God rewards good people and punishes those who are evil, and that the Messiah will come.  But what does \"complete faith\" mean? Does it have to be 100%? What about 99% or 60% for that matter belief in those things?  How do we reconcile \"complete faith\" when even the rabbis commentaries are less than unequivocal.  For example:  the concept that God \"creates and guides\" all creatures seemingly contradicts the notion of free will.  The fact that in this world bad people come out on top and the innocent suffer contradicts the first article of faith -- if our behavior is guided, then how can there be guilt?  And when we say we believe that the Messiah will come, in which context are we saying that -- do we assume that the Messiah might come only through a catastrophic war and not through mass repentance?  And does complete faith mean that we have to accept the entire Torah and works of the prophets in completely literal terms, or does \"complete faith\" allow for some verses to be understood as parable?</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, are we required to have a leap of faith, accepting each of Rambam's articles of faith to be true without study, or can we come to our own conclusions after first learning the Torah?</p>\n\n<p>And if someone thinks these things are true but doesn't have complete enough faith, what are the practical implications?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The following is based on many lectures by Rabbi Manis Friedman, a student of Chabad, which have helped me understand this topic.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When it comes to <em>anything</em>, we can never be 100% sure the facts we have about it are complete, correct, properly understood, etc. This is self evident, just take a typical news story. We can't be sure we are hearing the full story, nor can we be certain the report has no agenda or skew, we can't trust our own reasoning and bias, we see how almost nobody has the intellectual vigour to properly separate out the unfalsifiable data like peoples' inner motivations and character from the empirical data, hold off forming an opinion before reading the entire story beginning to end and making sure they understood it etc and have to assume we are not perfect at it either... There are also epistemological issues, even \"I think therefore I am\" is dubious, philosophically...</p>\n<p>Basically, the simplest rule of bittul and humility is to admit you don't <em>know</em>, you merely have a good guess.</p>\n<p>However, it's hard to get through life without having some sort of foundation, so everyone ends up \"believing\" things, and according to this definition, belief is when you are convinced you <strong>do</strong> know something is true. You accept it completely, without doubt, and without worrying about any of the above.</p>\n<p>Rambam comes along and says that as a Jew, it is your duty to believe 13 things.  Just like everything in life, it's very possible that these 13 things are impossible to \"know\" for sure, due to all of the above and more, however it is your duty to accept them as 100% true, without a doubt.</p>\n<p>This is <em>Emunah Sheleima</em>, and as the comments have pointed out, spending too much time on the wording is perhaps time better spent elsewhere. Especially after providing this answer, I think all Emunah is \"Sheleima\". If it isn't \"Sheleima\", it isn't Emunah.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, one can't magically believe something on will power alone, and this is often why religious people are considered unserious - the very rational among us feel they must be \"making believe\", i.e. they are lying to themselves that they really believe, and that's nice for them, but not something we can do.</p>\n<p>So no, one isn't expected to \"just believe\" or take a \"leap\" of faith. One should study, contemplate, and come to see how reasonable these 13 articles are. Once they are reasonable, we are now duty bound to accept them as beliefs. This is very reasonable; again we all have an instinct and need to believe certain things, and even very rational people will develop a set of beliefs (every rational person gets on a plane even though they personally are uncertain how it flies, but have reasonable arguments why it's a fair belief to have, that it won't fall out of the sky). Rambam and Torah are telling us that as Jews, these are the 13 beliefs we should have.</p>\n\n\n",

They were not prepared enough to be able to hear <em>Hashem</em> directly, so they could not do it by themselves. Therefore, the verse stresses that they stayed <strong>in the camp</strong>; and Moses needed to bring them to <em>Hashem</em> himself, as it continues with \"ויוצא משה את העם לקראת האלהים\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‏... ומזה חרדו כל העם, כי לא הוכנו לשמוע קול ה' בלא חרדה, שזה היה התנאי שיוכלו לקבל כל התורה מפי הקב\"ה, <strong>אבל הם חרדו ונשארו במחנה</strong> ולא יצאו לקראת האלהים.‏\n  <br><strong>ויוצא משה את העם לקראת האלהים.</strong> ועי\"ז הוצרך משה להוציאם בעל כרחם ע\"י כחו ודבורו וזכותו... ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hebrew Scripture was structured based on the principle of dichotomy.

There are other places with similar language about the sun:</p>\n\n<p>Psalm 84 תְּהִלִּים\nיב  כִּי שֶׁמֶשׁ, וּמָגֵן--    יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים:\nחֵן וְכָבוֹד,    יִתֵּן יְהוָה;\nלֹא יִמְנַע-טוֹב,    לַהֹלְכִים בְּתָמִים.  12 For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; {N}\nthe LORD giveth grace and glory; {N}\nno good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p>\n\n<p>Here we see that Hashem is called a sun \"שֶׁמֶשׁ\".</p>\n\n<p>ה  וְנַסְתֶּם גֵּיא-הָרַי, כִּי-יַגִּיעַ גֵּי-הָרִים אֶל-אָצַל, וְנַסְתֶּם כַּאֲשֶׁר נַסְתֶּם מִפְּנֵי הָרַעַשׁ, בִּימֵי עֻזִּיָּה מֶלֶךְ-יְהוּדָה; וּבָא יְהוָה אֱלֹהַי, כָּל-קְדֹשִׁים עִמָּךְ.   5 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and the LORD my God shall come, and all the holy ones with Thee.</p>\n\n<p>Here we learn that Hashem will come and save Israel from the big battle described in the chapter.  Will he come in person?  This cannot be true because we also read:</p>\n\n<p>Exodus Chapter 33 שְׁמוֹת\nכ  וַיֹּאמֶר, לֹא תוּכַל לִרְאֹת אֶת-פָּנָי:  כִּי לֹא-יִרְאַנִי הָאָדָם, וָחָי.    20 And He said: 'Thou canst not see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.'</p>\n\n<p>Ribbi Yehudah in Sefer ha-kozari explains that verse this way:\n'Of that divine glory mentioned in the scripture, there is one degree which the eyes of the prophets were able to explore; another which all the Israelites saw, as the cloud and consuming fire; the third is so bright, and so dazzling, that no mortal is able to comprehend it; but should anyone venture to look on it, his whole frame would be dissolved.' </p>\n\n<p>Would a sun be a fitting description?  I think so.</p>\n\n<p>Is such a being going to walk the earth?</p>\n\n<p>It seems better to understand it as he saved Israel in the past because we also read:</p>\n\n<p>Zechariah Chapter 14 זְכַרְיָה\nג  וְיָצָא יְהוָה, וְנִלְחַם בַּגּוֹיִם הָהֵם, כְּיוֹם הִלָּחֲמוֹ, בְּיוֹם קְרָב.   3 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when He fighteth in the day of battle.</p>\n\n<p>So it is to be as it was in the past, but in our day.  How did he fight the nations for Israel in the past?  He sent a human, be it Moshe, Yehoshua ben Nun, Gideon... He wrought salvation by their hand.  He also turned the sword of the wicked against his brother, which we read will also happen again.  Kind of like in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the latter verses of Zechariah are clearly the messianic age.</p>\n\n<p>Note too, the verses just after in Malachi:</p>\n\n<p>כא  וְעַסּוֹתֶם רְשָׁעִים--כִּי-יִהְיוּ אֵפֶר, תַּחַת כַּפּוֹת רַגְלֵיכֶם:  בַּיּוֹם אֲשֶׁר אֲנִי עֹשֶׂה, אָמַר יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת.  {פ}   21 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do make, saith the LORD of hosts. {P}\nכב  זִכְרוּ, תּוֹרַת מֹשֶׁה עַבְדִּי, אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִי אוֹתוֹ בְחֹרֵב עַל-כָּל-יִשְׂרָאֵל, חֻקִּים וּמִשְׁפָּטִים.  22 Remember ye the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.\nכג  הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי שֹׁלֵחַ לָכֶם, אֵת אֵלִיָּה הַנָּבִיא--לִפְנֵי, בּוֹא יוֹם יְהוָה, הַגָּדוֹל, וְהַנּוֹרָא.   23 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.\nכד  וְהֵשִׁיב לֵב-אָבוֹת עַל-בָּנִים, וְלֵב בָּנִים עַל-אֲבוֹתָם--פֶּן-אָבוֹא, וְהִכֵּיתִי אֶת-הָאָרֶץ חֵרֶם.  {ש}  24 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the land with utter destruction. {P}</p>\n\n<p>Eliyahu comes right before Moshiach.  This coming is necessary to \"turn the heart\", to bring about teshuva so that the \"sun\" doesn't burn everyone up with \"utter destruction\".</p>\n\n<p>Many can be saved on behalf of few:</p>\n\n<p>Genesis Chapter 18 בְּרֵאשִׁית\nלב  וַיֹּאמֶר אַל-נָא יִחַר לַאדֹנָי, וַאֲדַבְּרָה אַךְ-הַפַּעַם--אוּלַי יִמָּצְאוּן שָׁם, עֲשָׂרָה; וַיֹּאמֶר לֹא אַשְׁחִית, בַּעֲבוּר הָעֲשָׂרָה. 32 And he said: 'Oh, let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten shall be found there.' And He said: 'I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.'</p>\n\n<p>So the work of Eliyahu doesn't necessarily need to bring all to teshuva.</p>\n\n<p>So, in summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The verses after are the Messianic age.</li>\n<li>Hashem is called a sun in the Psalms.</li>\n<li>Hashem will save Israel by the hand of Moshiach.</li>\n<li>The coming of Moshiach to save is called the coming of Hashem in Zech. (The work of Hashem through men is often referred to as things done by Hashem, why not here?)</li>\n<li>Why not see this arising of the sun of righteousness \"שֶׁמֶשׁ צְדָקָה\" as Moshiach?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n\n\n",

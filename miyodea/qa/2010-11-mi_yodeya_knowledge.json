Is there a Chabad commentary on the Gemara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>There is a Chabad way of learning Gemara, as described by the Rebbe Rashab, the 5th Lubavitcher Rebbe and founder of Yeshivat Tomchei Temimim. In his <a href=\"http://www.sichos-in-english.org/books/the-tree-of-life-kuntres-etz-hachayim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kuntres Eitz Chayim</a>, he explains why it is necessary to learn Chassidus in addition to learning Gemara properly. The entire text is available online in English.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.sichos-in-english.org/books/the-tree-of-life-kuntres-etz-hachayim/01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction</a> to the english translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is, however, a possibility for negative consequences even within Torah study. Since the Torah is enclothed in worldly affairs and operates with the framework of human logic, it is possible that a person will look at it as no more than a system of wisdom, forgetting about G-d, the Giver of the Torah. When the Torah is studied with such an approach, it can become “a potion of death,” encouraging a person’s self-concern. Instead of serving as a tool to bring about the refinement of the world and the person studying, the study of the Torah can inflate the person’s ego and cause him to become more materially oriented.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it is necessary for one’s Torah study to include P’nimiyus HaTorah, the inner, mystic dimensions of the Torah, which focuses attention directly on the Torah’s G-dly and spiritual core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second half of the Sefer discuss the practical way Gemara should be learned.

It triggered the first murder in the world through Kayin and Hevel, Yishmael needed to be sent away so as not to influence Yitzchak, Yaakov had to flee from an enraged Esav and then finally Yosef was sold by his brothers. The narrative is one of consistent opposition and conflict. It is only when we get to Parshas Vayechi, right at the end of sefer Bereishis that we see this trend amongst brothers come to an end.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>When presented to Yaakov Avinu for a bracha at the end of Yaakov’s life, Ephraim and Menashe do not react, let alone flinch, when Yaakov swaps over his hands and blesses Ephraim, the younger, with the bracha reserved for the bechor (firstborn). There is only a sense of togetherness with no iota of resentment. Explains <strong>Rav Yosef Yehuda Leib Sorotzkin</strong> in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51116&st=&pgnum=221&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meged Yosef</a> that it is specifically due to Ephraim and Menashe’s response that we mention their names in the bircas habanim ahead of any other tzaddikim from the Torah. Menashe could have been immensely jealous as he was overlooked and Ephraim could have quite easily displayed a boastful persona. Yet this was not the case. It was this mutual respect that they had for each other that set them apart. As he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בראש ובראשונה אב רוצה לברך את בניו, שהשלום והאחוה ישרור ביניהם בהעדר גמור של קנאה וקפידא, כפי שהדגימו אפרים ומנשה שלא קנאו זה בזה, דאין יד שמאל מקנאת ביד ימין.\"</p>\n<p>“First and foremost, a father wants to bless his sons that the peace and brotherhood that exists between them should be completely devoid of jealousy and intolerance according to the example of Ephraim and Menashe who were not jealous of each other, that the one (under) the left hand was not jealous of the one (under) the right hand.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another answer which has also been alluded to above (but not sourced) is brought in the Oznayim LaTorah by the Lutzker Rov, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalman_Sorotzkin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Zalman Sorotskin zt\"l</a>, and is also mentioned in the Meged Yosef (see the next page in the link above) that despite being born in exile, they remained loyal to the Torah despite the Egyptian culture and environment. He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לי נראה לבאר באופן אחר, מדוע כל אב בישראל מברך את בניו שהיו כאפרים וכמנשה. אף שאפרים ומנשה גדלו במצרים, מכל מקום הצליחו להתעלות עד שהיו ראויים להכלל בשבטי י-ה. זה לא יתכן אלא אם כן מיצו את כל כוחותיהם</p>\n<p>It seems to me to explain in a different way, why every father in Israel blesses his sons to be like Ephraim and like Menashe. Even though Ephraim and Menashe grew up in Egypt, nevertheless they succeeded in rising to the point where they deserved to be included in the (12) tribes of G-d. This would not have been possible were it not for the fact that they exhausted all their strength (to succeed).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As observed by the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48375&st=&pgnum=79&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Mikdash Mordechai</strong></a> in his explanation on Vayechi 48:20.

What do Chazal mean by this?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi says in Breaishis Chapter 1, Verse 4: </p>\n\n<p>אף בזה אנו צריכים לדברי אגדה ראהו שאינו כדאי להשתמש בו רשעים והבדילו לצדיקים לעתיד לבא.\n\"Even this requires words of Aggadah, He saw that it was not fit for the wicked to use it (the light) and he separated it for the righteous in the future\"</p>\n\n<p>I often wondered what this Rashi means.  The following are some questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Where were the wicked that Chazal\nare referring to? </li>\n<li>How did Hashem separate it? </li>\n<li>Why don't the wicked deserve to use the light? </li>\n<li>How will it be used in the future?</li>\n<li>If we all have light, in what way did he hide it from the wicked? </li>\n<li>More to the point, what is the idea Chazal are trying to convey?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The light referred to by this Midrash isn't light in its conventional sense, but rather a special \"light\" or \"sight\" that is some sort of spiritual energy. Here is an excerpt of the Midrash Rashi is citing:</p>\n\n<p>אור שברא הקב\"ה ביום ראשון אדם צופה ומביט בו מסוף העולם ועד סופו כיון שהסתכל הקב\"ה באנשי דור המבול ובאנשי דור הפלגה שמעשיהן מקולקלין, עמד וגנזה והתקינה לצדיקים לעתיד לבא </p>\n\n<p>To address your points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wicked people who arise in every generation.</li>\n<li>Separation in this context means \"put away for later.\"</li>\n<li>Because they're wicked and would harness the light to further their evil objectives.</li>\n<li>The worthy use the special light to see \"from one end of the world to the other.\"</li>\n<li>We all have regular physical light. Not the special light referenced here.</li>\n<li>The simple meaning is our sages are revealing here a secret hinted by the Scriptural text, i.e. the existence of some spiritual force which is saved for the Tzadikim in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Midrash @Barry quoted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4809/how-did-hashem-hide-the-light-from-the-wicked-what-do-chazal-mean-by-this/5118#5118\">here</a>, tells us that the special light G-d created was used by Adam HaRishon to see from one end of the world to the other. Later, G-d hid that light and saved it for the Tzadikim in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The Ba'al Shem Tov taught that the light was hidden inside the Torah, and Tzadikim of every generation can use that light to see from one end of the world to the other.</p>\n\n<p>The Degel Machaneh Efraim, grandson of the Ba'al Shem Tov, attests that <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=23525&pgnum=6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">he personally saw the Ba'al Shem Tov do this many times</a>. He brings one story where the Ba'al Shem Tov sent a letter to his brother-in-law in Israel, mentioning that he (the Ba'al Shem Tov) had seen that his brother-in-law had spent a Shabbos outside the land of Israel. The brother-in-law responded that he went to do a bris milah on Shabbos, outside the land of Israel. How was the Ba'al Shem Tov able to do this? By using the light hidden in the Torah. He further points out that this is hinted to in the Ba'al Haturim, who points out that  את האור has the same numerical value as the word  בתורה (An English translation can be found <a href=\"http://www.chassidusonline.com/degel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://www.jewishindy.com/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=13460\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another essay</a> that further examines the Ba'al Shem Tov's explanation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=2059&size=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 8b</a>) says that the light of the sun was concealed in a sheath, that will be removed when Moshiach comes.

Even to suggest that by the performance of a Mitzvah you raise your level to merit a new Providential relationship to receive the desired outcome would be a stretch when applied to merely having some honor in assisting to do the Milah.  However, if the person believes that by being a Kvater it may help with their infertility the psychological impact might make a difference.  There have been many studies that have shown the relationship between the mind and the affects on the body.

In other words, is chasidus mainly in the \"philosophy\" and internal thoughts and beliefs or is it mainly external things like dress and minhagim, or are both required?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Complex question.</p>\n\n<p>I believe in the past there have been Hassidic thinkers who did not adopt the garb, but today we usually associate the two (but not necessarily).  (Was it the Kotzker who was a Hassidic thinker but not dresser?)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kolhamevaser.com/2010/08/an-interview-with-rabbi-dr-moshe-d-tendler/\">Rabbi Dr. Moshe Dovid Tendler recalls</a> an interesting conversation he had with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneurson, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe zt'l:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I asked him, “Why is it that your sheluchim (emissaries) take a fellow and make a Chasid out of him by putting a kapote (long black coat) and hat on him – even though he knows nothing at all about Judaism?” The Rebbe answered me, “But it works this way. If we tried it any other way, it would not work.” A person has to know that he belongs to the rest of his community before he can actually become part of it, and these outward signs allow him to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You could read into that what you will; I'd read into it that for the masses, adopting a complete brand is most effective.  But if some hybrid works for you, why not?  (The Rebbe didn't answer \"because keeping kosher is useless unless you wear a black hat!\")</p>\n\n<p>As for what to keep, I can refer you to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's responsum whether someone who has worn traditional Polish Jewish garb who moves to America must maintain it; he writes that you should keep the <em>minhag</em> (customs) of your ancestors, but not their <em>chumras</em> (choices to be extra-strict); for instance (I would gather), if you accept R' Moshe's logic that chalav yisrael in America today is a <em>chumra</em>, then you wouldn't be bound by your family's adoption of that <em>chumra</em>.  Minhag would be more like whether to stand or sit for kiddush.  He also writes that in his (pointedly non-Hassidic opinion), the evolution of Hassidic garb was that a great rabbi chose to wear a long garment (considered more modest, and the sign of a scholar) and make it out of silk (to avoid prohibited mixtures of wool and linen); it wasn't that the rabbi made an enactment that his followers should follow his example, just that they chose to emulate him on their own.  (Rabbi Feinstein further argues that American clothing today is \"American Jewish garb\" and no worse than \"Polish Jewish garb.\")</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are still Hassidic groups that operate with very strict definitions of \"in\" and \"out\", but in today's world, more and more people find themselves in different ways; if the way that works for you to believe in G-d and Torah and keep 613 is by using Belz tunes, Lubavitch philosophy, and Lithuanian customs, at the end of the day I'd stay you're still a good Jew.  (But that's my opinion.)</p>\n\n<p>Now if you choose to hybridize legitimate streams of Orthodoxy, be aware that some people will be more okay with this than others, that it might be worth thinking about what practices to do publicly vs. privately, given your environment; and that some bridges are best not burned.  That's a path you have to find for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Much <em>hatzlacha</em> (success) in your journey!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Chasidus strongly believes in keeping the Minhagim and dress of the previous generations. Thus someone that would not keep the Minhagim is not really being Chasidish. However there are different Chasidishe groups that dress in different manners (Lubavitch wears bend down hats, Stolin wears regular brim up hats, Bobov wears high beaver hats, Satmar wears low beaver hats). Thus you can be Chasidish in many different modes of dress if you follow the dictates of that particular Chasidus. </p>\n\n<p>My father always tells me that when the Torah talks about a murderer it is talking about a Frum Jew that has murdered someone. He does everything a Frum Jew does yet he went ahead and murdered someone. Thus there are people that may consider themselves Chasidish even if they are not doing everything 100% right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A person can be a Hasid without necessarily belonging to a specific group. In my experience and from what I heard in the name of many Rebbe's, some of the greatest Hasidim they knew did not dress the part and did not blindly follow whatever the other Hasidim were doing. It does not mean that one can just pick and choose, rather one should be a thinker and adopt those practices that will help him in his service of Hashem and not adopt those practices which will hinder his service of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Berurah goes along the same lines.</p>\n\n<p>Thus women are allowed m'ikar hadin to drink from the wine.  Minhag HaMekubalim is for the wives to make Havdallah at home for themselves and their children, as the men hear havdallah in the yeshiva, and then remain after for several hours learning Kabbalah.(Adonneinu Ben Ish Hai pg. 12 discusses how Yeshivat HaMekubalim Beit El and Yeshivat HaMekubalim Nahar Shalom both have this minhag and currently study Da'at U'Tevunot of the Ben Ish Hai).</p>\n\n<p>However there is a custom for women not to drink from the wine when a male has said havdallah, in\nMagen Avraham 298 S\"K 4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נהגו הנשים שלא לשתות מכוס הבדלה וע' הטעם בשל\"ה, כ' בש\"ל בה' קידוש כוס של הבדלה רגיל המבדיל לשתות כלו ואין משקה ממנו בני הבית:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His main source is the Shla\"h Masecta Shabbat Torah Or (while overall it is pretty Kabbalistic I will bolden the part that deals directly with the issue):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מבדיל בין קודש לחול וכו'. ותקנו בכאן\n  ארבע הבדלות, כנגד ארבע קליפות שסביב\n  האצילות, והם 'רוח סערה... ענן גדול,\n  ואש מתלקחת, ונגה לו סביב' (יחזקאל א,\n  ד). ואלה הם סוד עשרה כתרים תחתונים\n  הנקראים קליפות ליודעי חן. ואלה הקליפות\n  הם מחיצה בין ישראל לאביהם שבשמים\n  כשגורמים העוונות, ועל זה כתוב (ישעיה\n  נט, ב) 'כי אם עונתיכם היו מבדילים'\n  וגו'. ושכינה מתלבשת בהם בימות החול,\n  לקיים (תהלים קג, יט) 'ומלכותו בכל\n  משלה', ולקיים (שם מז, ט) 'מלך אלהים על\n  גוים'. והוא סוד 'בכל צרתם לו צר'\n  (ישעיה סג, ט). וכתיב (תהלים צא, טו)\n  'עמו אנכי בצרה', בסוד גלו למצרים שכינה\n  עמהם וכו' (מגילה כט א), והוא בשביל\n  לשמור את בניו, והם כמשל הגרזן ביד\n  החוצב, והם הרע שבעץ הדעת, והדברים\n  עתיקים.    ודע, כי בשבתות וימים טובים\n  מתלבש הקדוש ברוך הוא בפאת הטוב שבעץ\n  הדעת, והם סוד בגדי קודש. ובמוצאי שבת\n  מתפשט מהם, ומתלבש בקליפות הנזכרות\n  להנהיג העולם. ולפי שהלבושים של שבת הם\n  כדרך בריאה ויכולים להתערב בהם אלה\n  הקליפות, תקנו לנו להבדיל במוצאי שבת.\n  וזה סוד כלאים ושעטנז, והמערבם, עליו\n  הכתוב אומר (במדבר יט, כ) 'כי את מקדש\n  ה' טמא'. אבל המאורות העליונים שהם בדרך\n  האצילות, אין שום טומאה נוגעת שם ולא\n  מתערבת עמהם. וזהו סוד ההבדלה, המבדיל\n  בין קודש לחול, המאורות העליונים בגדי\n  קודש, והתחתונים חול, ובין אור לחושך\n  סוד המאורות העליונים שהם האור הנעלם,\n  והחושך שהם הקליפות. ובין ישראל לעמים,\n  ישראל נטלו נוף האילן מקום קדוש, והגוים\n  טמאים דבוקים במקום טמא, והם הקליפות\n  הנזכרות, וצריך להבדיל ביניהם, ובין יום\n  השביעי שהוא קודש לששת ימי המעשה\n  הנזכרים שהם חול, והמבדיל ביניהם הוא\n  העושה הטוב בעיני השם, עכ\"ל (תולעת\n  יעקב).   <strong>עוד כתב (תולעת יעקב, סוד\n  מוצאי שבת, אות כ\"ב) וזה לשונו: וכבר\n  ידעת מה שאמרו רבותינו ז\"ל (ברכות מ א)\n  בסוד העץ שחטא בו אדם הראשון, גפן היתה.\n  ואמרו (בראשית רבה פי\"ט ס\"ה) מלמד שסחטה\n  ענבים ונתנה לו, והם 'סורי הגפן נכריה'\n  (ירמיה ב, כא), 'קבעת כוס התרעלה'\n  (ישעיה נא, יז), כוס חמתו. וכנגד זה בא\n  לאשה דם נדות, סוד הזוהמה שהטיל הנחש\n  בחוה (שבת קמו א). ולפי שנתכוונה\n  להבד(י)ל מאדם על ידי היין, אין הנשים\n  טועמות יין של הבדלה.</strong> ועתיד [כבוד]\n  הקדוש ברוך הוא להתפשט מן הקליפה\n  ולהראות לישראל פנים בפנים בלי שום\n  מחיצה, כענין שכתוב (שם ל, כ) 'ולא יכנף\n  עוד מוריך והיו עיניך ראות את מוריך',\n  וזה יהיה בזמן שיתקיים מה שכתוב (שם כה,\n  ח) 'בלע המות', וכתיב (שם כד, כג)\n  'וחפרה הלבנה ובושה החמה', (סוד השר\n  הידוע ובת זוגו), ואז יתקיים בשני\n  הדודים 'והיה אור הלבנה כאור החמה ואור\n  החמה יהיה שבעתים כאור שבעת הימים ביום\n  חבש ה' את שבר עמו ומחץ מכתו ירפא' (שם\n  ל, כו), עכ\"ל (תולעת יעקב).ל, כו), עכ\"ל (תולעת יעקב).  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is my rough translation of the key piece:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The vine was the secret of the tree\n  with which Adam HaRishon sinned.  As\n  it is said (Bereshit Rabba) “That she\n  squeezed grapes and gave them to him,\n  and they are degenerate shoots of a\n  foreign vine (Yeremiyahu 2:21) “the\n  dregs of the cup of reeling” (Yeshyahu\n  51:17) And corresponding to this comes\n  to the woman blood Niddah, the secret\n  of the serpent came upon Eve he\n  injected a lust into her (Shabbat 146A).\n  Since the intention is that it will be\n  separated from the man by means of the\n  wine, women do not tasted of the\n  havdalah wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short there is no source that a lady will grow a beard.  However, there is a source for her not drinking from the Havdalla wine under the proper (or improper as the case may be) circumstances.  Obviously if she makes havdallah for herself (as is a custom in many communities) she must drink from the wine.  However, when she doesn't then it is better for her not to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>No. She will not grow a beard from drinking Havdalah wine. For an excellent article on this question and on whether she <strong>may</strong> drink from the wine read this <a href=\"http://hakirah.org/Vol%2010%20Zivotofsky.pdf\">article</a> by Rabbi Zivotofsky in the latest volume of Hakirah (Volume 10). It will be available in full for free when the next volume ships out.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I think I once heard as follows (hope the details are correct): There are questions about whether a woman is obligated in the brachah of \"Borei Meorei HaEish,\" and if not, her \"Amein\" after that brachah is considered an interruption after the brachah on the wine. It would thus be problematic for her to drink the wine without a new brachah. Since most people would not properly understand the particulars of this reasoning, there was just a blanket minhag that woman don't drink the havdalah wine. The beard thing was probably just an added \"incentive\" for those who might doubt minhagim, but would never mess with the spooky stuff. (That's my own theory, at least.)</p>\n\n\n",

In the Orchos Halacha section it notes that Rabbi Pollack heard from the Rebbe of Pshevorsk that he reasoned; he has never seen a lion, but since the mishnah says that one should be \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.20?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גבור כארי</a>\" (\"mighty like a lion\") it indicates that it is quite fierce, and one can possible assume that a pregnant woman might become scared. And thus, this is the primary concern, not because it is a tamei (impure) animal. However, this teaching was based primarily on the premise that he had never actually seen a lion. Accordingly, if a woman regularly visits the zoo and knows she won't be scared, then there is no problem with her going, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Tuvia_Weiss#:%7E:text=Rabbi%20Yitzchok%20Tuvia%20Weiss%20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss</a> ruled that it was ok for a pregnant woman to visit.</p>\n<p>It also mentions the Sefer HaBris that has already been mentioned above as well as the Sefer Invei HaGefen (2nd cheileck, 12:10) that if she will be transfixed at the sight or deeply scared which will make a profound impact on the foetus, then she should refrain from visiting. However, similarly, if she is used to going and there is no worry about her being scared etc. then it is permissible.

(It was observed on different dates, depending on if you lived in a Catholic/Protestant country, or an Eastern Orthodox [Christian] country; the former have Christmas on December 25th, thus \"nittel nacht\" starting at sunset December 24th; the latter have a different calendar.).  There were customs in Eastern Europe about men not learning Torah and/or women not going to the mikva that night, at least not until after midnight.</p>\n\n<p>The simple meaning of the term is \"nacht\" means night; \"nittel\" as in \"neonatal\"; \"birth night\", as it was the night observed by Christians for the birth of Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest explanation is found in <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/715371/Dr_Shnayer_Leiman/Jewish_Perspectives_on_Early_Christianity_-_Nittel,_the_Ninth_of_Teves_and_Pope_Simon_Peter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Leiman's lecture on yutorah.org</a>; that the night of Christmas often had a lot of non-Jews roaming the streets (occasionally drunk), and thus it was a dangerous time to be outside.  Therefore, women were told not to go the mikva, and men not to go out to study halls or synagogues to study (most people didn't have a lot of study material at home).  Past midnight, everyone was in church (or headed home), and it was safer outside.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/6037/jewish/Tevet-17.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hayom Yom (17 Teves)</a>, the reason given (in the name of R' Shalom Dovber Schneersohn, fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe) is \"to avoid adding vitality.\" The point is that the person whose birthday they're celebrating on this day was a Jew, and since on a person's birthday his <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/790/shouldnt-we-thank-hashem/798#798\">mazal</a> (spiritual source) is stronger, we don't want the spiritual benefits generated by our Torah learning to be diverted towards strengthening his mazal.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard different customs about what to do when it comes out on Friday night. Some say that Shabbos overrides this issue, since as the Zohar, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1562/friday-night-prayer-before-maariv-kegavnah-or-bameh-madlikin\">recited by some on Friday night</a>, says, וכל דינין מתעברין מנה - all harsh judgments go away in the face of Shabbos.

Some explain it as a pragmatic concern since anti-Jewish violence was a common feature of non-Jewish religious holidays. I believe the Chasam Sofer hypothesizes that it was to be rested in order to wake up and learn at midnight so the situation wouldn't occur thant non-Jews were up worshiping while the Jews slept. Another view is that we do not wish to strengthen the negative spiritual forces brought about by the celebration, a view that seems to be particularly prevalent among those who observe the practice.</p>\n\n<p>Some observe the practices of Nittel Nacht even if it falls out on Friday night, others do not.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46444&st=&pgnum=381&hilite=\">Nitei Gavriel</a> has one of the more extensive discussions of the topic, including the various other practices associated with it and questions arising from the fact that their holiday is observed at different times.

    "content": "# May a Katan (minor) perform Melachah (\"work\") on Shabbath?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my experience, I've noticed that many people take for granted that if one needs a Melachah to be performed on Shabbath, one may have a minor, especially one under the age of 3, perform what is needed (eg., turning off a light left on in a bedroom Friday night).</p>\n\n<p>It's apparently not widely known that because of a question raised by Tosafoth (Shabbath 122a), the Magen Avraham (325:22) infers that one may not benefit from Melachah performed by a child who has been asked to do it. The Peri Megadim takes this a bit further and understands that it is a really big problem to ask a child to perform Melachah.</p>\n\n<p>But even the Peri Megadim, to the best of my knowledge, does not go so far as to ban the Hanaah (benefit) of Melachah performed by a child who does it on his own. This seems to parallel the Halachah of benefiting from Melachah performed by a gentile (and, indeed, this is, I believe, the generally accepted understanding - at least in my personal experience and limited research). </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Would this not imply that the prohibition against having a child perform Melachah is of rabbinic origin? What about \"Atah UVincha UVitecha\" (Shemoth 20:9)?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If you have your own child do a melacha for you, this is certainly a violation of atta uvincha uvitecha and is worse than having a non-Jew (who is not your servant) do the melacha for you, which is only rabbinic.  The sugya which you bring is talking about a generic minor who does the melacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Short answer: No. \n I believe that this is answered directly in the hakdamah of the Mishneh Berura to hilchot shabbat, and I know that it is answered in the Yalkut Yosef's Hilkhot Shabbat.  Essentially it is ossur to ask a non-Jew or a child to violate an issur d'oraitta under any normal conditions.  In general principle when there is a great amount of tzar or there is a sick person, that can be modified.  Though it would seem that is a Jewish child is never asked, but also is not reproached if they act under their own initiative.  See Magen Avraham 316 S\"K 17(also see Shmirat Shabbat K'hilchata chapter 30) for an instance of the issur of asking a non-Jew, and see the various Mishna Berura's brought on O\"H 316:11-12, where there are various instances of tzarei ba'alei haim that we would be unable to remedy, but we do not reproach a child who undertakes to help the animal of his own initiative.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/ask-child-to-switch-lights-on-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dose of Halacha</a> writes that there are 2 issues - 'sefiyah' and 'chinuch'. He brings sources that allows you to have a young child (too young to understand) do melacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (Sukka 42a) writes that parents are obligated to teach and train their children to do mitzvos before they become bar / bas mitzva. This obligation, chinuch, only applies when a child is old and mature enough to appreciate what they are doing and why. The Mishna Berura (128:123) writes that with regards to most mitzvos, the age is approximately 5 to 6.</p>\n<p>The Gemara (Yevamos 114a) writes that adults mustn’t feed children non-kosher food or make them do things that are forbidden on Shabbos. The Shulchan Aruch (OC 343:1) writes that this prohibition, known as sefiyah, also applies even if they are only forbidden miderabanan. Nonetheless, this only applies if the adult is specifically instructing the child to do the prohibition (See Mishna Berura 343:4).</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch Harav (OC 343:10) writes, however, that one may give things to a young child on Shabbos even though you know that they will do something that is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Thus, R’ Yisroel Dovid Harfenes (Nishmas Shabbos 7:479) and the Piskei Teshuvos (343:2) write that one may stand a young child in front of a light switch on Shabbos even though they will switch it on or off, providing that they are too young to comprehend what they are doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the Proper Way to Read Genesis 35:22?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Vayishlach, there is a verse (Genesis 35:22) that contains a \"Piska Be'emtza Pasuk\": a new paragraph in the Torah scroll begins in the middle of the verse. However, unlike with other examples of this phenomenon (e.g. Numbers 25:19), there are two versions of the trup (cantillation marks) given simulataneously, depending on whether the verse is read as one verse or two separate verses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָ֖ה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֑֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵֽ֑ל וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other places we have multiple note-choices printed per word are in the Decalogue, and we are assisted in teasing apart the טעם העליון and טעם התחתון (upper notes and lower notes) by handy printings in the back of the Chumash.</p>\n\n<p>When leining this, we are supposed to (I think) make it a single pasuk. Indeed, there are homiletical interpretations given for why this ought to be a single pasuk. In that case, I can see four possibilities for how to read it, given that the trup for the words ראובן and וישכב appear to be interchangable:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗ן וַיִּשְׁכַּב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>4:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל\n  וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>always keeping in mind that if you use a note for the one-verse leining version, the other printed note must still be able to work properly for the two-verse version.

    "content": "# paying for an apartment\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently came across an article describing the situation in Israel where in order to finalize an engagement, the parents have to pay for an entire apartment (not just a down payment, the whole price).  It also described the anguish involved, where parents must go into debt, or even move out of their own apartment to do this, and if they don't the shuidduch is canceled.</p>\n\n<p>My question is... is there a difference between different communities in this (i.e. Chabad, etc.).  The article said only that it affects the \"haredi\" (i.e. not Mordern Orthodox) communities, but I'm thinking maybe it's not <strong>all</strong> parts of the haredi community.</p>\n\n<p>If there are Chasidic groups that don't follow this, are there statements from the Rebbe that outline what should be done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Tough question.</p>\n\n<p>There's a shiur on yutorah citing a responsum whether a grown child can pester his parents for money.  The halacha is that once a child is old enough to go out on their own (I believe the Israeli rabbinic courts will put that at 15 or 16), the parent has no hard-and-fast obligation to support them anymore, though continued support for their spiritual growth is considered meritorious (and counts towards charity tithes).  It is appropriate for a father to offer <em>some</em> kind of dowry so his daughter is more likely to get married, but that's a different discussion.  Thus the parents have no obligation to fund a grown child, so it's a violation of Halacha to emotionally pain your parents by pestering them.</p>\n\n<p>What happens today has nothing to do with halacha.  The sad truth is, who doesn't want to see their daughters happy/married/happily married?  And well, in a certain world in Israel, many guys won't consider your daughter unless you can buy him an apartment.  </p>\n\n<p>I've heard that the Gerrer Rebbe, showing fiscal leadership, has banned young couples from moving into apartments in the most expensive neighborhoods of Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, they need to start out in cheaper places; even if this couple could legitimately afford it, then the next couple could <em>almost</em> afford it, and before you know it, that's become the norm and expectation to which everyone is pushed.</p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, in communities where people are working for a living, there's less need (and therefore less pressure) for the parents' buying an apartment; additionally, in communities where singles meet on their own, Baruch Hashem men and women meet and decide they like each other and want to get married, instead of holding anyone's lives up for ransom via complicated monetary arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>I've also heard (and again this is hearsay, pardon me if my language is strong here) that the Hassidic community in Israel has generally fared better in openness towards working for a living than the Ultra-Orthodox \"Lithuanian\" community.  The former understands it's a movement for the masses; the latter is still putting everyone through the grinder, trying to produce a handful of super-great scholars. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My understanding from talking to people and learning in various Kollels here in Israel, is that it is primarily a Lithuanian Haredi thing, though some branches of Hassidic Haredim hold by the same practice, and it is not practiced at all in the Sephardi community.  </p>\n\n\n",

It seems like a problem that could not be solved by habituation or conditioning since there can be such a long lag between the initial catalyst (meat) and the trial (milk).</p>\n\n<p>What is the most effective strategy to remind oneself not to eat dairy within the time limit after having meat? Is there a different strategy for one who has years/decades of experience than for a newbie? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>When you finish with meat, look at your watch and say, \"Okay, no dairy until 4PM.  4PM.  4PM\"  (Or whatever time.)  Especially helpful on short shabbos afternoons; as soon as you're done eating meat, check the clock, add the appropriate number of hours, and think about what that time will feel like.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, waiting the appropriate amount of time is the halachically right thing to do, and any strategy to guide yourself that direction is appropriate.  But if someone did slip up and forget and eat a yogurt an hour after their hamburger, the correct course of action is strategizing for the future, not guilt-tripping.  It's at most a mistaken violation of a custom, which requires no atonement (the Nesivos says violating a rabbinic commandment by mistake requires no atonement).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if you saw a nice yogurt and made a \"shehakol\", then suddenly realized <em>oy vey!</em> you ate a hamburger an hour ago, I've been told it's better to go ahead and take one taste (no more!) of the yogurt (assuming no other <em>shehakol</em> food is handy); better to violate the waiting custom than say a bracha for naught.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I once sat next to somebody on a flight to Israel (where our normal sense of time is probably even more distorted), and as soon as we were done the fleishig meal, he set the timer on his watch to make sure to wait the alloted time. I don't know if he always did this, or just on a flight, but it seemed like a great idea.</p>\n\n<p>Practically speaking, though, I don't know if this is easier or harder to condition oneself into doing than Shalom's solution of just reminding oneself \"4PM 4PM 4PM\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I think that for me personally, as a religious Jew, I am always conscious of what I am putting into my mouth.

Shapiro</a>:<blockquote>\nThe fourteenth-century R. Eleazar Ashkenazi ben Nathan ha-Bavli...assumes that the extremely long lifespans found at the beginning of Genesis are not to be taken literally (p. 29).</p>\n\n<p>וימי חייהם אז היו כימי חיי אנשי דורנו לא פחות ולא יותר כי לא היו אז מזהירים כשמש ולא חזקים כנחושה, אבל היו מבשר ודם ומזרע אשה ומדם נדותה ככל אשר אנחנו עושים פה היום</p>\n\n<p>If people never lived so long, why were these number included in the Torah? R. Eleazar claims that Maimonides’ approach is to regard the lengthy lifespans as simple figures of speech, not meant to be taken literally any more than the statement that the Land of Israel was flowing with milk and honey or that the cities in Canaan were “fortified up to Heaven” (Deut. 1:28).[17]</p>\n\n<p>He also offers another explanation for the lengthy lifespans, namely, that the Torah recorded what the popular belief was, no matter how exaggerated, and Moses was not concerned about these sorts of things. In other words, just like today people say that the Torah is not interested in a scientific presentation of how the world was created, R. Eleazar’s position is that the Torah is not interested in a historically accurate presentation. In his mind, this has nothing to do with the Torah’s goals, and therefore there was no reason for the Torah not to present matters as they were believed at the time, even if these perceptions were inaccurate. The important thing, he says, is that the people would know that from the creation of the world until Israel stood at Sinai was close to three thousand years. This would help solidify belief in creation. The records of lifespans are just a means to illustrate this information.[18] He adds that when it came to events closer to Moses’ time, Moses was careful in preserving a more accurate accounting, while leaving the stories of the distant past cloaked in legend.</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways rationalists have dealt with the lengthy lifespans. For example, R. Nissim of Marseilles regards these years not as indicating an individual life, but rather the “lifespan” of the way of life (i.e., laws, customs) instituted by the figure in question, or the time until another one like him arose. He also assumes that when the Torah says that someone bore a son, it doesn’t have to mean a literal son. Here is what he writes in Ma’aseh Nissim, p. 274:</p>\n\n<p>יש מי שפירש שהכונה בחיים ההם קיום נמוסיו והנהגותיו הזמן [בזמן] הנזכר, בין בחייו בין אחר מותו. כי אלו, אפשר שהיו אנשי שם, מחקים חוקים ונימוסים, ומנהגים במידותיהם, גם במאכלם ומשתיהם ובמלבושיהם, ואחר הזמן ההוא אפשר שנשתכח הכל ובחרו דרך אחרת. או תאמר, שלא קם כמוהו עד זה הסך מן השנים במעלת ידיעת ההנהגה לבני דורו. ובזמן ההוא קם כמוהו במעלה, נמשך לדעתו וכונתו, ונחה רוחו עליו כאשר נחה רוח אליהו על אלישע. ואם לא ראה הראשון זה שקם אחריו ולא היה בזמנו, אפשר למד מספריו או התבונן בדבריו המקובלים, ועל זה כתוב: \"ויולד\" שהוליד בדמותו במעלה, כאלו הוא הוליד האיש ההוא מאשר הוא בעל הדעת ההוא שלמדוהו.‏</p>\n\n<p>In support of this approach, he refers to Va-Yikra Rabbah 21:9 which cites an opinion that Scripture intimated to Aaron that he would live 410 years. Although the Torah tells us that he only lived to 123 (Num. 33:39), the Midrash says that the righteous High Priests in the First Temple are called by Aaron’s name. In other words, they represent the spirit of Aaron, so in that sense it can be said that he lived so many hundreds of years. So too, R. Nissim thinks, when Scripture speaks of other people living so many hundreds of years it is to be understood in this fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach was suggested by R. Moses Ibn Tibbon, who is quoted by R. Levi ben Hayyim.[19] According to Ibn Tibbon, the years given for people’s lives are actually the years of the dynasties they established.[20] (His other suggestion is the same as that of R. Nissim, mentioned above.):</p>\n\n<p>והחכם ר' משה פירש, כי כל אחד מאלו היה מלך או הניח נימוס, וכל זמן התמדת מלכותו ומלכות זרעו, או כל ימי המשכות נימוסו, קרא דור אחד, כאלו היה המלך או מניח הנימוס חי, וטעם \"ויולד בנים ובנות\" כי לאורך הזמן רבו ועצמו בני מלכותו או אנשי דתו, ושלחו קצתם אל ארץ אחרת.‏</p>\n\n<p>R. Levi ben Hayyim offers basically the same approach (p. 326):</p>\n\n<p>ונראה לי כי הדורות הנזכרים היו ראשי אבות, וזרע כל אחד נקרא בשמו כפי מספר השנים ההם. כי כל אחד, כמו שנאמר, הוליד בנים ובנות, כמו שנראה היום, עד שנשקע השם מהדורות הבאים אחריו, וקח מאתו זרע איש אחד מפורסם, וקראו בני זרעו ומשפחתו על שמו זמן מה, וכן התמיד עד שנתחדש דור אחר, נקרא [!] בניו ובני בניו על שמו [צ\"ל שם] חדש. והורה ספור הדורות ההם מאדם ועד זמן משה על חדוש העולם.‏</p>\n\n<p>[17] In Guide 2:47 Maimonides says that the people mentioned in the Bible who lived so long were exceptional in this respect, either because of their diet, mode of living, or due to a miracle. R. Eleazar obviously does not see this as reflecting Maimonides’ true view.</p>\n\n<p>[18] He writes (p. 30):</p>\n\n<p>ואל תתמה על זה ואל יקל בעיניך זאת התחבולה הנכבדת שנתכוון אליה כדי לאמץ האמנת החדוש . . . ולזה הוצרך ע\"ה לספר לנו חשבון השנים שעברו מזמן חדוש העולם עד זמננו, וזה היה עיקר גדול וצורך נפלא</p>\n\n<p>[19] Livyat Hen, ed. Kreisel (Beer Sheva, 2004), pp. 324ff. Here is the place to congratulate Howard Kreisel on the publication of the two volumes of Livyat Hen as well as R. Nissim of Marseilles’ Ma’aseh Nissim.

Every modern survey and census of Jews in America has been performed with the <strong>widest</strong> possible definition of Jew, in order to obtain the fullest and least-controversial numbers.  This usually translates to counting someone as a Jew if they identify themselves as Jewish.  (<a href=\"http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46185\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<p>For example, a recent census, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Jewish_Population_Survey\" rel=\"noreferrer\">National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01</a>, primarily counted someone as a Reform Jew if they <strong>considered themselves</strong> to be one.  The more stringent definition was simply those who are members or are affiliated with to a Reform synagogue.  (<a href=\"http://www.jewishfederations.org/local_includes/downloads/6262.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)  Neither definition gets anywhere near \"Halakhic.\"</p>\n\n<p>The most recent census (as of this edit), the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pew Research - Portrait of Jewish Americans</a>, also used <strong>self-identification</strong> as their primary criteria.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Even if one were to attempt to find out, they'd run into the following problems:</p>\n\n<p>Reform Judaism accepted Patrilineal Descent <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in 1983</a>.  Any survey or census  performed since will have been done <strong>according to their standards,</strong> which means that the latest generations of Reform Jews will only needed to have just one Jewish parent, and the data will not distinguish which parent it is.  </p>\n\n<p>In addition,  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If the child of a Christian father and a Jewish mother is not raised Jewish, the child is a Jew according to the Orthodox movement, but not according to the Reform movement. The matter becomes even more complicated, because the status of that interfaith child's children also comes into question.\"  (<a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/whoisjew.htm#Who\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Reform Judaism stresses the importance of being raised Jewish; if a child is born to Jewish parents and was not raised Jewish then the child is not considered Jewish.\"  (<a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most recent study, performed by Pew Research, underscores this issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The number of Americans with direct Jewish ancestry or upbringing who consider themselves Jewish, yet describe themselves as atheist, agnostic or having no particular religion, appears to be rising... and most U.S. Jews (62%) say being Jewish is mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while just 15% say it is mainly a matter of religion.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, there are Jews who would be considered Jewish by Halacha, but <em>not</em> by Reform!</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the Pew Survey illustrates yet another issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Even among Jews by religion, more than half (55%) say being Jewish is mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, and two-thirds say it is not necessary to believe in God to be Jewish.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am far from an expert on this issue, but if I recall correctly, there are <em>many</em> problems with one's halakhic status if one denies God.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Judaism counts the children of converts as Jews.  However, Reform conversions are not performed to traditional halakhic standards, rending their children non-Jewish according to Halakha.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, even if the mother was halakhically Jewish, there are many problems with potential mamzeirut, as Reform Judaism does not conduct halakhically valid marriages and divorces.  While Mamzeirim <em>are</em> Jewish, they are many halakhic issues regarding their integration into the broader Jewish community, and thus any census of \"Halakhic Jews\" would have to include them as a separate category.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Non-halachic Reform Jews are those whose mother was not Jewish, yet they consider themselves Jewish because of either a heterodox conversion or patrilineal descent. We can mostly figure out the demographics from particular questions asked in certain surveys.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2013 Pew Study</a> on American Jews, <strong>10%</strong> of American adults who identify their religion as Judaism and their denomination as Reform say that their mother was not Jewish. (19% if you include those who consider themselves Jewish \"aside from religion\" and Reform, but we're going to focus on those who consider themselves associated with Judaism in some form.) Assuming that the percent of these people who converted Orthodox and later changed to Reform is negligible (which seems to be backed up by the data), we can assume that practically all of these individuals are not halachically Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>This gets more complicated when we consider the descendants of the female portion of that group. Any of the children who still consider themselves Reform Jews would say that they <em>do</em> have a Jewish mother, and the same for <em>their</em> descendants on the female line. How many people are there in this group?</p>\n\n<p>At the time of the survey, Reform Jewish women who say that their mother was not Jewish were 7.8% of the American (adult) Reform Jewish population. (Yes, the gender balance is massively skewed.) We have a fairly small sample size to work with for this group (less than 60 people), but we can get estimates of some basic points: 85% of the portion of the group with children have Jewish spouses or partners according to the respondent (38% are married to Jewish spouses overall), they have 0.8 children on average, ~1/3 of which are currently minors living in the respondents' homes, most of which are being \"raised Jewish\". About 55% of people raised Reform Jewish (regardless of whether they say their mother was Jewish) continue to identify as such as adults. Pew did not ask about the current religious affiliation of the respondents' adult children who don't live with their parents, so we'll have to rely on some educated guesses based off of what we know of Reform Jews in general.</p>\n\n<p>So, how many adult Reform Jews have mothers who self-identify as Reform Jewish but are not halachically Jewish? Without taking into account the considerable denominational switching between groups, the amount of Reform converts who were raised not Jewish by non-halachic Reform Jewish mothers but later started to identify with Judaism (Pew only asked those with no Jewish parents whether they had converted), or the differences in norms between generations, or the fact that many of the relevant mothers might be no longer alive, the group might be about <strong>2-3%</strong> of American Reform Jewry. There may also be a smaller group of third-generation descendants of these groups, but probably not enough to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>So, approximately <strong>87%</strong> of adult Reform Jews in the United States are halachically Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>In Canada, according to the <a href=\"https://www.environicsinstitute.org/projects/project-details/survey-of-jews-in-canada\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2018 Environics Institute survey of Jews in Canada</a>, <strong>93%</strong> of Canadian Reform Jews responded that their mother was Jewish. There is insufficient data available to determine the number of on second- or third-generation non-halachic Reform Jews. 16% of Canadian Jews identify as Reform, 98% of which identify their religion as Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, according to the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2015 Pew report</a> on the country, 3% of the Jewish population identifies as Reform. According to the report, <strong>100%</strong> of the 89 Reform respondents said that their mother was Jewish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>While, no exact number can be known, estimates are possible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/us/rabbis-still-resist-interfaith-marriage-study-shows.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">In a survey done with Reconstructionist, Conservative, and Reform rabbis</a>, no Conservative rabbis would perform an intermarriage, 36% of Reform rabbis would, and 62% of Reconstructionist rabbis would.</p>\n\n<p>In a population survey, 33% of American Jewish Families were \"interfaith families\", while another study says that currently, just over 50% of marriages are \"interfaith marriages\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forward.com/articles/116715/#ixzz1hil6LtzQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to this article</a>, It's hard for me to tell if 33% of intermarried Jewish families had a Jewish mother, or if 29% of Jewish woman, and 33% of Jewish men were intermarrying.

Only some of these are purifiable via the mikvah; others require other procedures. Nevertheless, the mikvah is indeed effective in purifying this person from certain kinds of impurity.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way, then, he explains, R' Akiva means to say that Hashem is willing to act as a mikvah in this sense. Even if a person is not yet ready to do teshuvah for all of his or her misdeeds, Hashem will accept that person's teshuvah for what he or she is ready for, and forgive those - so that now they can start psyching themselves up to do teshuvah for the next thing, and onward.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I recommend that you take a look at the works of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_J._Twerski\">R' Dr. Abraham J.

Self-esteem is a very big theme in his books.

God expects humans to strive to always move upwards; <strong>where</strong> exactly you are on the ladder is secondary.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Dan Segal explained a verse in tehillim \"זדים הליצני עד מאד מתורתך לא נטיתי\": sins I have committed intentionally pressured me, but I haven't strayed from your Torah. King David was tormented by personal failings but didn't let them deter him from Hashem's service. There is a well-known Chassidishe saying that the Yetzer Hara isn't after getting you to sin as much as getting you to feel depressed about it afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Advice which has worked for many people (including myself): Instead of obsessing over the here and now, formulate a 12-month (or 5-year) plan in which you take upon yourself teeny little baby steps that move you away from a particular practice you wish to drop.

However, since the general public holds like the Mishnah Berurah instead, the footnotes are there to tell people how the Mishnah Berurah holds. Similarly, the new ArtScroll translation covers the opinions of modern poskim like R' Moshe Feinstein (who the general American public holds like). Similarly, in Israeli printings of the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, you can find an appendix written by the Chazon Ish about halachot that apply only to Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>(I do think that R' Mordechai Eliyahu's version of the Kitzur with footnotes from Ben Ish Chai has a different purpose. Since Sepharadim are very easily able to get their hands on a copy of the Ben Ish Chai, and it's not too much larger in Hebrew or English than the Kitzur is, there doesn't really seem to be a need to print the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch simply to make a comprehensive modern sefer of halacha avaialable. In this case, I think the point really is to be able to learn the psak of different poskim/eidot comparatively.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>WAF, with lack of time in the day for 3 halacha sedarim.  Most will learn a sefer which is in line with their Yeshiva's path (commonly MB nowadays) or the Aruch haShulchan which provides good background and chidushim.  However, they would like to know if there are dissenting opinions among the other big Halachic rulers.  A quick footnote allows for that. </p>\n\n\n",

Well actually it gets started in the same place in the Tur, where the Beit Yosef cites the Yeraim saying that when eating\nberries etc. and one’s hands are dripping with colored fruit, care should be taken not to\ntouch clothes or napkins, because of coloring. Even though it is mekalkel, it is ossur mid’rabanan. He adds that it is prohibited to place a cloth etc. on a bleeding wound because of.  The Bais Yosef in siman 328:38 complements this saying that one should wash the wound and then place the cloth. The subsequent coloring of the cloth is through a\ng’rama, because the wound had no blood when the cloth was placed.</p>\n\n<p>The Darchei Moshe in siman 320:2 says that the Agor(one of the Rishonim) holds that one\nmay bandage a wound with a cloth or wipe one’s dirty hands on a cloth because it is\ncalled dirtying and has nothing to do with coloring.</p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham 320:24 rules in accordance the Beit Yosef, against the Darchei Moshe.  The M”A also says that wiping blood with a red cloth is worse than wiping with a white\ncloth. This can either be because the newly applied red color strengthens the old color\nor because it is not possible to say that it is dirtying when it is the same color.  The M\"B rules the same way.</p>\n\n<p>From there the conversation heads in the direction of menstruation and the sheva nekiim:\nThe Shulchan Aruch 303:15 says that a woman may wear a cloth used for absorbing\nmenstrual bleeding in a reshut harabim, and the issue of coloring the cloth never arose.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav learned from here that a cloth designated for that particular use is not prone to coloring, because one does not care for its coloring. Only a regular cloth, which I understand to mean that sometimes one would dye it intentionally, is prone to the problem of.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach says(as quoted in Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchta 14 footnote 62) that dyeing the cloth with blood is not coloring, because one is merely using the cloth instead of a spoon and not in order to color the cloth.</p>\n\n<p>One should l’chatchila wash a wound before applying a cloth. The Shmiras Shabbat 35:18 says that bandages, plasters, gauze and everything set aside specifically for this purpose may be applied without prior washing the wound. This is based on the Shulchan Aruch HaRav mentioned previously.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Auerbach also permits wiping with a tissue or disposable napkin because one does not care for its coloring since it is being disposed of.(Shmirat Shabbat 14:19)</p>\n\n<p>Now as far as the toilet\nColoring water for a decorative purpose is strictly forbidden even though water in itself\nis “food”, M”B 56.</p>\n\n<p>It is much more tricky The reasons permitting it are a) the intention is to disinfect and ‘by the way’ the water gets colored. B) It is done by way of Grama- an indirect action, because flushing the water ‘causes’ the color to be flushed from the small container and color the water.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons prohibiting it are A) the intention is to color the water as well, not only to\ndisinfect; otherwise they could manufacture colorless disinfectant. B) The first rush of\nwater is called your action and not.</p>\n\n<p>It is a mahloket poskim.  Where some permit and some forbid.  Personally I am machmir and remove it before Shabbos, since Rav Shlomo Zalman forbade it(Shmirat Shabbat 23:14).  Removing it on Shabbat involves muktze and one should do so with one’s foot. When confronted with this apparatus in someone else’s house, I suggest lifting it a bit with one’s foot and flushing (requires a bit of deftness). If impossible, I think one should flush (maybe using an elbow?) and rely on the lenient opinions because of Kavod L'Briut.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't have much to add to the Rabbi's excellent answer. However, I want to point out that, with the blood, there may be a distinction between using a disposable and a non-disposable cloth. According to some Poskim, although soiling an object is not a Biblical violation--since the melachah of tzovaya refers only to improving or beautifying something through dyeing--it is rabbinically forbidden in this case. However, with a disposable napkin or tissue, apparently \"all authorities agree\" that it is permitted. </p>\n\n<p>(Unfortunately I cannot tell you who these \"some Poskim\" or \"all authorities\" are, since I can't read my book's Hebrew footnotes. But the book itself is \"The Shabbos Home: Volume Two\" by Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen of Lakewood, 2003.) </p>\n\n<p>My source also agrees with Rabbi Tzadok with regards to toilet deodorizers. Bunim says: \"There is dissent among the contemporary Poskim regarding the colored blocks of deodorizer commonly placed in toilet bowls. Some hold that these may not be used on Shabbos, for they cause the water to become colored during flushing. Others maintain that these deodorizers are permitted for use. Therefore, it is best to remove these items from one's toilet before Shabbos. In the event they were not removed, one should remove them on Shabbos. If this is not possible, and no other bathroom is available, one may rely on the Poskim who permit the use of these deodorizers on Shabbos.\" </p>\n\n<p>(Since my book calls them \"deodorizers,\" I would wonder if there were not also possibly a problem with makeh bepatish insofar as you are improving the scent of the water and toilet.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Chacham Ben Tzion Abba Shaul in his Ohr L'Tzion 1:29( unfortunately Hebrewbooks does not have the first chelek) brings a bunch of reasons to be meikel by a colored soap in the toilet. Its not able to dye something else, it gets displaced very quickly ,one doesn't want to dye with it, and it is a psik reisha dlo nicha lei compounded with a koach kocho(indirect control ). In the end of teshuva he writes  that one can be lenient with peshitos(simplicity).  </p>\n\n\n",

However, the only word appearing for the language of the Jews is \"יהודית/Jewish/Yiddish\" -- no \"לשון הקדש\" or \"עברית\". Granted, one reference is during the 2nd Temple period (Nehemiah 13:24). However, in II Kings 18:26, an Assyrian emissary is asked to speak in \"יהודית\" rather than in ארמית/Aramaic. </p>\n\n<p>Why, then, even at this earlier point, when the entire nation of Israel lived in the land, is the language specifically referred to as the Judean language? Is that meant to imply that the other tribes were speaking something different?

One famous example of this is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meisha Stele</a>, written either in the Phoenician script or ancient Hebrew, which are two similar alphabets and the words themselves are a form of Hebrew.</p>\n<p>In Tanach we see that many people from Am Yisrael had names that were also used by the Edomites.

The following is only a small part of what he has to say on the matter of Hebraic dialects):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"With the building of the Temple, many architectural terms were added to the Hebrew language, influenced by Syrian architects and builders. These terms we learn from Kings I and Yechezkel, where they appear, hundreds of years later, in style differences and names and lingual varieties that we have yet completely interpret. Moreover, commerce ties with India, Arabia, Southern Africa and Egypt were developed. Due to the split between the two kingdoms, Judea and Israel, a situation came about that one bordered the nations that spoke a southern Semitic dialect and the other had neighbors who spoke a northern Semitic dialect...Yonah ben Amitai, from Gat Hachefer...his city of birth, Gat Chefer, was in the Tribe of Zevulun, not far from Tzidon, and was surrounded by the Phoenician langugage, whose influence can be found in the richness of this prophet's speech...\"Beshelmi\" (Yonah 1:7), which came from the mouth of one of the sailors. This is a clear Phoenician term...\" (pg. 205-207)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Like all of the prophets, Ovadiah prophecied the destruction of the kingdoms whow ere considered, techincally, vassals of Judea: Edom, Peleshet, Efraim, Shomron and Gilad...\"S'farad\" is a word with a Phoenician structure, with a Dalet at the end (like \"Rafsad\")...\"Ketel\" is a northern Semitic and Aramaic word...by Yonah, whose birthplace neighbored the northern border of the area of the Hebrew language...we find more than any other prophet, words taken from Phoenician and even Assyrian...like \"Meshamrim\" instead of \"Shomrim\", \"Lo\" instead of \"Oto\", \"Charishit\" instead of \"Me'alefet\"...by Hoshea and Amos the differences in the north are more defined. Especially we find by them Shin instead of Samech...for example, בשורי instead of בסורי; and השירו instead of הסירו. And by Amos we find בושס instead of בוסס, and בולס instead of בולש, and מסרף instead of מצרף. And in Hoshea, און instead of הון...\"Anach\" (Amos 7:7) is a strange Sumerian word which entered the Hebrew through Phoenician, and the same about Haharmonah (4:3). From the common language of the north we find \"Doga\", \"Avtit\", \"Kaluv\", \"K'vrah\"...</p>\n<p>By Nachum we find Assyrian titles for officials - \"Tafsar\" (3:17)...likewise for \"Hutzav\" and \"Gulta\"...</p>\n<p>At the time, the richness of the language in Judea reaches its peak. The first in the line of southern prophets is Yoel...by Yoel the word \"Acar\" similar to the Arabic verb \"Acar\" - to farm the earth. By Yoel we find for the first time the word \"Kerem\" and whole slew of farming terms: \"Mamgerah\", \"Magrefot\", \"Dashah\", \"Magal\"...the rest of the new words point to a relationship with the southern Semitic dialects spoken by the neighboring nations...\" (pg. 300-303)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, it seems very likely that the Hebrew dialect of Judea became known over time by other nations as \"Yehudit\" - \"Judean\".</p>\n<p>For more on Hebrew dialects, see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYL6_SxHfg4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, for example.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Well historically speaking the only time, pre-Babylonian exile, that the word יהודית(which in this case is probably best translated as Judean) is employed is when the Assyrians move to sack Jerusalem.

People were unsure which one to focus on in their prayers (as is the proper thing to do, as the Gemara goes on to point out, and as is codified in Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 576:15). R' Shmuel bar Nachmani recommended that they pray to Hashem to eradicate the plague, since \"when the Merciful One gives plenty, it is to the living that He provides it\" - i.e., that the cessation of the famine would necessarily lead to the end of the plague too.</p>\n\n<p>Pharaoh used the same logic. The Plague of Locusts, like all of the other plagues, was accompanied by pestilence (Shemos Rabbah 10:2). He was canny enough to realize that he need ask only for \"this death\" - the locust infestation that was causing a famine - to go away, and automatically the pestilence would disappear too. (Whereas with the other plagues there wasn't this direct relationship, since they didn't attack Egypt's food supply.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch (as well as others) point out that this was the first time locusts had reached Egypt. If they were not eradicated before they managed to lay their eggs, it would become a permanent and recurring plague. This would be the death of Egyypt because it would destroy all future agriculture. This was not a temporary plague that would disappear once things went back to normal. The very existence of locusts, even as a normal event, would be the death of Egypt.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Rashi question only the Darkness\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why does Rashi ask why the plague of darkness was brought upon them, but did not ask the same by any of the other plagues?</p>\n\n<p>Text of Rashi 10:22:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ולמה הביא עליהם חשך</strong>, שהיו בישראל באותו הדור רשעים, ולא היו רוצים לצאת, ומתו בשלשת ימי אפלה כדי שלא יראו מצרים במפלתם ויאמרו אף הן לוקין כמונו. ועוד שחפשו ישראל וראו את כליהם, וכשיצאו והיו שואלין מהן והיו אומרים אין בידינו כלום אומר לו אני ראיתיו בביתך ובמקום פלוני הוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Before answering your question, I will strengthen it. Rashi is channeling midrash, as he so often does. And by other makkos, the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=10&mefaresh=raba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Rabba</a> does give a reason, in the same form. Thus, immediately preceding is arbeh, locusts. And we read there in the midrash:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר ה' אל משה נטה את ידך \n  ארבה למה הביא עליהן? \n  מפני ששמו את ישראל זורעי חטים ושעורים, לפיכך הביא עליהן ארבה ואכלו כל מה שזרעו להם ישראל. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and yet Rashi does not seem to mention this middah keneged middah aspect. However, the midrash says by choshech as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חשך למה הביא עליהן? \n  יתברך שמו של הקדוש ברוך הוא שאין לפניו משוא פנים והוא חוקר לב ובוחן כליות, לפי שהיו פושעים בישראל שהיה להן פטרונין מן המצריים, והיה להן שם עושר וכבוד ולא היו רוצים לצאת. \n  אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא: אם אביא עליהן מכה בפרהסיא וימותו יאמרו המצריים: כשם שעבר עלינו כך עבר עליהן, לפיכך הביא על המצריים את החשך שלושה ימים, כדי שיהיו קוברין מתיהם ולא יהיו רואין אותן שונאיהם ויהיו משבחין להקדוש ברוך הוא על כך. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would suggest that while the vast majority of what Rashi says is channeled midrash, he <strong>channels</strong> the midrash in order to answer peshat-based concerns. Thus, his famous methodological statement of  ואני לא באתי אלא לפשוטו של מקרא ולאגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא דבר דבור על אופניו. (Though I interpret that in a different manner elsewhere. And see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/6103/is-rashi-really-pshat\">here</a>.) So, the question might be, what does citing this midrash add, as a peshat concern?</p>\n\n<p>I would answer that this is because of the chamushim comment he will make later, in Beshalach (13:18). The pasuk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּסֵּב אֱ־לֹהִים אֶת הָעָם דֶּרֶךְ הַמִּדְבָּר יַם סוּף וַחֲמֻשִׁים עָלוּ בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרָיִם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and Rashi writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וחמשים: אין חמושים אלא מזויינים. לפי שהסיבן במדבר גרם להם שעלו חמושים, שאלו הסיבן דרך יישוב לא היו מחומשים להם כל מה שצריכין, אלא כאדם שעובר ממקום למקום ובדעתו לקנות שם מה שיצטרך, אבל כשהוא פורש למדבר צריך לזמן לו כל הצורך, ומקרא זה לא נכתב כי אם לשבר את האוזן, שלא תתמה במלחמת עמלק ובמלחמות סיחון ועוג ומדין, מהיכן היו להם כלי זיין שהכום ישראל בחרב. וכן הוא אומר (יהושע א יד) ואתם תעברו חמושים. וכן תרגם אונקלוס מזרזין, כמו (בראשית יד יד) וירק את חניכיו וזריז. דבר אחר חמושים אחד מחמשה יצאו, וארבעה חלקים מתו בשלשת ימי אפילה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If he is going to be establishing it within the midrashic narrative later on, he might as well cite the midrash in its local place as well, to provide further support and a consistent structure.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, he will say later that only 1/5 left, on chamushim, so it is a good idea to prepare his reader and solidify his commentary by noting the midrash that 4/5th died during the plague of Darkness, in its place.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are quite a few answers here is one from the Terumas Hadeshen. He says the reason only at Darkness does Rashi specifically say why darkness is that since it lasted 6 days it would seem HAshem broke his promise that \"day and night Shall Never Cease\"(Berisheis 8:22). It actually was not as the Jews had light and the promise was it would not stop for all of the world but for Parts Like ALska at ceartin points it is not a problem. So to allow the Evil ones to be killed and to answer why not a breaking of promise Rashi Had to Provide answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Following the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/30463\" rel=\"nofollow\">כללי רש\"י</a> from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, this is the way it appears to me.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's initial question is, since he previously established that the Makkos were <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9871#showrashi=true&v=22\" rel=\"nofollow\">7 days each</a>, with 21 days of warnings, the immediate question here is why is this makka only 3 days? He then answers that there were two three day periods of different types [one in this verse, one in the next]. [The seventh day would be the day the Makka started, as the previous Rashi explained that the night being worse was part of the Makka, so here since it started by day (as Hashem only spoke to Moshe <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/false/aid/9873/jewish/Chapter-12.htm#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">by day</a>), and Miktzas Hayom Kekula to count to 7, but for the three day periods you would expect them to be equal, so the three days of each are three full days].</p>\n\n<p>This follows the rule that Rashi expects the student to remember what was previously said.</p>\n\n<p>This then raises the question - why is this Makka divided into two parts, which is different than the other Makkos? This Rashi answers with a different question - what is the purpose of the whole Makka? In the answer he gives two reasons, which correspond to the two periods. The first reason (to bury the dead) requires only that it be dark so that they couldn't see. The second reason (to investigate the possessions in the Egyptians' houses) requires that they be immobilized in their houses.</p>\n\n<p>This follows the rule that Rashi never states the student's question, he just answers it. When he asks a question it is because he expects that the student has a different question, and in order to answer that one, Rashi asks a separate question, the resolution of which answers the question which prompted Rashi's explanation.</p>\n\n<p>From this the answer to your question is that Rashi isn't out to explain the purpose of the Darkness as a stand alone question, rather he is bringing this explanation of its purpose in order to understand why it had two stages.</p>\n\n\n",

They had to Borrow because the Shulchan aruch says that gold and silver of Idol Worshipers has a law like an Idol and it is Unlawfill to own it, there is another Law that a Jew can not Nullify an Idol. Hence they borrowed the items in order that after the Plague of the firstborn the gemara in Avodah Zarah says they said about their own Idols\"They are worthless, as they where unable to save us from this terrible plague\" hence nullifying their Idols. Therfore the Jews can now keep the gold, if they would have legally  acquired it by taking it as gifts earlier, they would not have been unable to keep it as it was an Idol now that they borrowed it and the Egyptians Nullified it it is theirs for the Keeping. This answers the other question too that is to ask people to ask to borrow is uncomfortable as you dont want to seem like you are begging, but to take from Hefker like after the Splitting of the sea you see the opposite happened and Moshe had to tell them to leave. </p>\n\n\n",

What changes?</p>\n\n<p>(for why mezonos a whole year see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/791/matzah-mezonos-or-hamotzi\">here</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Most Sephardim use \"soft\" matzah instead of \"hard\" matzah, and \"soft\" matza technically has the brakha of HaMotzi.  \"Hard\" matza is more a problem, though there are many Sephardim, especially Chutz L'Aretz, that use it.  Essentially according to Sephardi Halakha hard Matza is not mezzunot, it is sofek mezzunont/sofek lehem.  Most Sephardi poskim hold that the Chiuv of the day overrules the sofek.  There have been some extensive teshuvot written about this in the last hundred years since hard matza was introduced to Sephardim.\nYehave Da'at 1:91 and 3:12\nYaskil Avdei 6:18, 8:5, and 8:52 are a couple of places that it is dealt with at greater length.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In fact Sefardim do not use the Matzah that is familiar to most of us for the Seder on Pesach. The Sephardim eat a soft and thicker Matzah, which is similar to a pita. They would make a Hamotzi on this type of Matza anytime.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is an undisputed fact that Hazal only gave the Beracha of Hamotzi to products of the five grains that are normally used as a meal. If the product is normally used for snacking then the beracha is mezonos unless one eats enough of it for it to anyway be considered a meal. \nThere is a type of bread called \"Pas Habaah bikisanin\" that is not usually eaten for a meal. There is a 3-way dispute as to the definition of this type of bread. One opinion is that its consistency is not that of bread, rather it is hard and brittle. Since there are 2 other opinions on the definition that would disagree with the beracha of hard brittle bread being mezonos, it is a safek to us what its beracha is (as well as a safek if one must wash for it). </p>\n\n<p>To disagree with the other responses, many sefardim use the hard matzot for Pesach, especially in Hutz La'Aretz. They still make HaMotzi on it on Pesach because on Pesach it is normal to use such cracker-matzoh for a meal. Once Pesach is over and regular bread is permissible, it becomes unusual to use hard matzoh as a meal and therefore its beracha becomes a mezonot.</p>\n\n\n",

Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are some other places where יושבי is used similarly. In Josh. 17:7 ישבי עין תפוח is used as a geographical marker, and in v. 11 there seems to be a distinction between the cities and their inhabitants: בית שאן... ויבלעם... ישבי דאר... וישבי עין דר... וישבי תענך... וישבי מגדו. But that just strengthens the question as to what this difference means.</p>\n\n<p>It's possible that יושבי פלוני means \"the people who resettled the city after it was abandoned (or destroyed) previously.\" We do find the kings of the \"יושבי\" cities listed among the 31 kings that Yehoshua defeated (Josh. 12:9ff): דביר, תפוח, דאר, תענך, מגדו. Whereas by contrast, בית שאן and יבלעם are indeed not listed there. So in other words, \"going to יושבי דביר\" would mean trying to dislodge the new inhabitants.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I see with this idea is that it doesn't seem to fit the information given in Judges. In 1:27, where the list of Menashe's unconquered cities is repeated, תענך and יבלעם are switched around in position and in the presence or absence of ישבי. Also in vv. 31 and 33 several cities are mentioned with ישבי attached, but those are not among the earlier conquests.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# cities that start with ה־\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are a good number of cities referred to in <em>Y'hoshua</em>, of course, and a sizable percentage (I'm guesstimating about 5%) of them start with ה־‏‎ (most famously הָעַי‎, I think).<ul><li>What determines which ones do?<li>Does it mean \"the\"? (Note that the ה־‏ combines with the <em>sh'va</em> prefixes, as in \"לָעַי\" (<em>Y'hoshua</em> 8:2), which makes it <em>seem</em> like it means \"the\".)</ul></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It looks like a lot of them are common nouns that became names of cities. For example, העי literally means \"the ruins\"; הגדרה, \"the fence\"; החרמה, \"the destruction\"; and so forth. Probably each of them was named for some prominent local feature or historical event.</p>\n\n<p>So perhaps indeed any such place became known with the prefixed ה (so as to distinguish, for example, between \"The Ruins\" and any other ruins).</p>\n\n<p>Though there are some exceptions, such as המכמתת in Josh. 16:6. Perhaps indeed those derive from common nouns in non-Semitic languages, or perhaps there \"ha\" is part of the root word rather than a prefix.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a famous mahlokes in Shelah by the Maafilim who tried to defy the decree on the generation of the Midbar to go in to Eretz Canaan. It says that the Canaani crushed them \"ad HaHarmah\". Most say Harma was the name of the place and others say it means \"until the state of destruction.\" It is clear that either opinion holds that the heh is a prefix and is not part of the name.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, consider how Gen. 1:27 says generally that G-d created man and woman, and then in 2:18ff it fills in the details. Another example is where Josh. 4:1 speaks of all of the people crossing the Jordan, then the next few verses flash back to what happened before and during the crossing.</p>\n\n<p>So here too, v. 14b is the general answer: \"G-d took us out of Egypt with a strong hand.\" Verse 15a then explains the details of how this came about.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be that these are answers to two different questions. In the Haggadah the question מה זאת is referring to the mitzvos of Pesach (even though, in context, it would seem to be talking about the mitzvos relating to firstborn children and animals); the answer to that is to tell about the Exodus.

However, if it falls off without your knowledge and there was no immediate intention to put it back on then it appears another Berakha is required.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've heard the shulchan aruch says that if it totally fell off, then yes, you'd make a new bracha when putting it back on.

If you took them off for five minutes to help carry suitcases, you wouldn't need a new bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly wherever you're checking your tefilin is a place where tefilin can be worn; but I wonder if there's enough of a pause and concentration needed to open and check tefilin if you can still have that in mind.

In this context, the Torah is saying that the entire sheep species (irrespective of age or gender) is kosher.  Contrast with Exodus 12:5, מן-הכבשים ומן-העזים, \"if you're looking to bring a Passover sacrifice, the animal must be less than a year old, so get a lamb or kid goat.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Malbim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40722&st=&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ayeles HaShachar 279</a>), the Torah uses the word כבש when talking about כבשים alone; and uses כשב when talking about כבשים as well as other species.

Strashun himself asserts that a <em>keves</em> refers to a lamb in its first year, but <em>kesev</em> refers to all sheep regardless of age:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אולם אני הוכחתי מק\"א (ועמש\"כ בפסחים סט ב) דדוקא כבש הוא בן שנה אבל כשב הוא כולל המין כולו בן שנה ובן שתים ולמעלה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The question we're addressing here is why they mentioned that Egypt has graves. It seems odd. If they wanted to stress that dying is just as possible in Egypt as in the desert (which does have a nice rhetorical flourish), why not word it as \"Did you take us to die in the desert because we couldn't die in Egypt?\"? Why graves specifically?</p>\n\n<p>I suspect an answer may be as follows. However, it's my own, and merely a conjecture.</p>\n\n<p>According to one explanation in <em>Rashi</em> to 13:18, 80% of the Jews died a short while before these events. <em>Rashi</em> to 10:22 says that these were the Jews who had not wished to leave Egypt, and were <em>r'shaim</em>. These Jews were, presumably, buried. However, the other Jews would not want to be buried near them, as <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&pgnum=416\" rel=\"nofollow\">we don't bury <em>r'shaim</em> near <em>tzadikim</em></a>. So there was a valid concern that, what with all the new Jewish cemeteries in Egypt, full of <em>r'shaim</em>, there were, indeed, no cemeteries for the <em>tzadikim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But now that the Jews were regretting having left Egypt, they were putting themselves in the same boat as those who had died. Either the live ones were admitting to being <em>r'shaim</em> like their dead cousins, or they were claiming that their dead cousins were in fact <em>tzadikim</em>. Either way, they could be buried near them. So they demanded of <em>Moshe</em>, \"Did you take us out here to die because there were no usable graves in Egypt? because we are <em>tzadikim</em> and those cemeteries are for <em>r'shaim</em>? It's not true! We could just as well have been buried there!\".</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer given is simple.</p>\n\n<p>The Jews were in a sticky situation. On one hand, they saw the Egyptians closing in on them. On the other hand, Moshe is busy with Yosef's bones. Hence they scream \"WHAT!! IS THERE NO CEMETERY IN EGYPT?\" Unfortunately, they suffered for their words, as almost all the people there did end up dying in the desert, which illustrates the power of words.</p>\n\n\n",

Also why is it not mentioned in Hilchos Yom Tov also?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mechilta in Parshas Beshalach says that on Shabbos the Maan tasted and looked different than the whole week. (What it means exactly - I do not know - as the Maan tasted based on what you wanted it to taste, so what was different on Shabbos? Also did the Shabbos portion change color on Shabbos or did it look different when you picked it on Friday?) </p>\n\n<p>However, based on this Mechilta you can answer that we eat Kugel on Shabbos due to the fact that the Maan had a superior look and taste on Shabbos. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I saw another answer from the <strong>Toras Chaim</strong> the reason we eat all the foods we eat on Shabbos Kodesh is because it is similar to Moshiach coming which is Known as A day that is all Shabbos. Therfore we eat Meat as a symbolic gesture towards the Meat of the <strong>SHOR HABOR</strong> and Fish instead of the <strong>LEVYOSON</strong> we drink wine Instead of the <strong>WINE</strong> for the Tzaddikim. The Gemara in <em>Chaggiga</em>(YUD BEIS) says there are Seven Heavens one of them called SHECHAKIM that is it is the part of the sky where the Maan is prepared for the Tzaddikim in the future.Therfore it is this Maan that the Ramah is refering just as we eat the other food as a symbolic gesture for the Days of Mosiach so to the all important Kugel which represents the Manna which the Tzaddikim will eat in the times of Mosiach.</p>\n\n\n",

But after all, Ibn Ezra <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/ibn-ezra-on-aseres-hadibros-part-iii.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודע כי המלות הם כגופות והטעמים הם כנשמות והגוף לנשמה כמו כלי. ע\"כ משפט כל החכמים בכל לשון שישמרו הטעמים ואינם חוששים משנוי המלות אחר שהם שוות בטעמן</p>\n<p>And know that the words {lexical items} are like bodies and the meanings are like souls, and the body is as a vessel to the soul. Therefore, the rule of all the scholars of every language is to guard to meanings and not pay particular heed to changes in the words, since they are identical in their meaning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These might merely be synonyms, then, and the question makes an unwarranted assumption.</p>\n<p>But let us grant that assumption. I have another answer in store.</p>\n<p>The first cited pasuk actually <strong>does</strong> speak of <em>rima</em>. That is,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלֹא שָׁמְעוּ אֶל מֹשֶׁה וַיּוֹתִרוּ אֲנָשִׁים מִמֶּנּוּ עַד בֹּקֶר <strong>וַיָּרֻם</strong> תּוֹלָעִים וַיִּבְאַשׁ וַיִּקְצֹף עֲלֵהֶם מֹשֶׁה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vayarum does not mean that they ascended, but it means that they become wormy. Thus,  וַיָּרֻם תּוֹלָעִים means that they became wormy with worms, tolaim.  וַיָּרֻם is the verb and  תּוֹלָעִים is the noun, functioning as a sort of adverb. This adverb makes even more clear the meaning of the verb.</p>\n<p>In the second pasuk, when speaking about the state, there is no verb + adverb. Rather, it wants to refer to a simple noun describing the state (or lack of state). This is called רִמָּה. Maybe, actually, it is an adjective / noun. There was no 'worminess' in it. This is the most efficient and clear way of describing it, given the part-of-speech involved.</p>\n<p>As a related aside, ancient science believed in spontaneous generation of worms, such that food rotted and then became wormy, as a development of this rot. Thus, Chazal in the Mechilta claim this is a mikra mesuras, and invert the order of the first pasuk,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּרֻם תּוֹלָעִים וַיִּבְאַשׁ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They assert that really, of course, the וַיִּבְאַשׁ occurred first. And Ramban has to go out of his way to explain, against Chazal, why in this special instance the developing of worms happened first. See <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2010/01/twisting-pasuk-to-make-it-accord-with.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. The reason I make this aside is to help bolster this understanding of the process, the verbs involved, what <em>rima</em> was ('worming' as opposed to 'rotting', or connected with rotting), and thus why it really would have been inappropriate to say תּוֹלָעִים in the second instance -- it was this developed state of rima, 'worminess', rather than a bunch of worms, which were being discussed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <strong>Gra</strong> answers רִמָּה is a small worm and תּוֹלָעִים are large. That is when they leftover Maan they got big worms but on Shabbos when they are supposed to save for the next day not even a small worm could get into the supply.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1178783/jewish/Hebrew-Text.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avot 3:1</a>, Akavia the son of Mahalalel says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולאן אתה הולך? למקום עפר <strong>רמה ותולעה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is translated in the Siddur Tehillas Hashem (I think the translation was done by Immanuel Schochet) an is <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/682516/jewish/English-Text.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">brought here</a> as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>where you are going--to a place of dust, <strong>maggots and worms</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, according to this, \"רמה\" == Maggots and \"תּוֹלָעִים\" == Worms</p>\n\n\n",

This is probably in large part because the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=203&size=1\">Shabbat 40A</a>) doesn't give a temperature, but rather says that Yad Soledet Bo is \"hot enough to scald a baby's stomach\". </p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the temperatures given:</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-cooking-on-shabbos/02.htm\">here</a>, based on Shabbos KeHalachah by Rabbi Y. Farkash:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most Poskim agree that Yad Soledes Bo is between 40 and 45 degrees Celsius (<em>104-113 Fahrenheit</em>), or approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit. (Shabbos KeHalachah, p. 24.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are (at least) 15 opinions from various Poskim brought <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/chulin/halachah/ch-hl-008.htm\">here</a>, each one with sources (which I didn't look up). I'll quote the ones that have numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Chelkas Yakov (YD 44:3): If water gets between 50 and 70 degrees (Celsius), this is Yad Soledes Bo -- (<em>between 122 and 158 Fahrenheit</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Igros Moshe </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>(OC 4:74): It is proper to be stringent to be concerned lest 43 degrees is Yad Soledes Bo. There is a Safek until 71 degrees. That is surely Yad Soledes Bo, even to be lenient. -- (<em>43C == 109F and 71C == 160F</em>)</p></li>\n<li><p>(YD 2:52): Yad Soledes Bo is about 79 degrees, to be stringent. (<em>79C == 174F</em>)</p></li>\n<li><p>(YD 3:31): Surely, 74 degrees is Yad Soledes Bo. (<em>74C == 165F</em>)</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Minchas Yitzchak (7:61): Sixty degrees is surely Yad Soledes Bo.  (<em>60C == 140F</em>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Minchas Shlomo: I say that there is no concern less than 45 degrees. (<em>45C == 113F</em>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>\"Yad soledes bo\" is the lowest temperature at which halacha considers cooking to take place.  It's defined as the temperature that would make your hand uncomfortable.  This can vary a good degree between people (as experiments with hot showers, or drinking hot tea, have shown), so various rabbis have suggested certain standard numbers.</p>\n\n<p>If I recall correctly, anything less than 113F is considered certainly not \"yad soledes.\"  Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach deduced this from the halacha that a duck has a very high internal temperature, yet it's not \"yad soledes\" (to cause problems from blood getting \"cooked\" into the knife used to slaughter it); assuming the duck could have a mild fever, that gets us to 113F.  </p>\n\n<p>Ask a person on the street what temperature is uncomfortable, and they'll usually tell you 120F; if you have a question between 113 and 120, ask your rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>On the flipside, we don't consider something \"definitely yad soledes\" for the purposes of leniency (e.g. this was already \"cooked\" once) unless it's a much higher temperature; I seem to recall 160F or maybe 170F at the very highest for that purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people.

    "content": "# 2.4 million killed according to Rashi in B'shalach. Why does no one talk about it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the begining of Parshat B'shalach, Rashi says that one p'shat for \"Vachamushim\" means one fifth, because during Makas Choshech, 4 out of 5 were killed out, and it happened during the time it was dark so that the Egyptians shouldn't see (although, I'm sure once that darkness went away,they would have noticed a HUGE difference in the Jewish population). If you do the math, 600,000 went out of Mitzrayim, which means that four fifths = 2,400,000. My question basically is, why is there no mention of this anywhere? Why were these people killed out? Why are we celebrating the g'ulah of 600,000 while 2.4 million were killed out? This has always bothered me.....</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The Jews that died, did not want to leave Mitzrayim. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because of these problems Rav Shwab\n  says that the Medrash should not be\n  understood literally - rather only a\n  relatively small number died, but had\n  they lived they would have given birth\n  to millions of people over several\n  generations. The three opinions are\n  arguing about how many descendants\n  would have come from those that died.\n  He suggests that perhaps all they\n  disagree about is how to make an\n  accounting of the survivors - one\n  holds that we measure up to a certain\n  point in time such as the building of\n  the Beis HaMikdash, and another\n  measures to a later point and\n  consequently there are more\n  descendants over that longer period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbiygefen.blogspot.com/2011/01/long-term-consequences-bo.html\">http://rabbiygefen.blogspot.com/2011/01/long-term-consequences-bo.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

However this is the only Shabbos that has a special name simply because of what we read in the Parsha. (Sefer Hatodaah)</p>\n\n<p>Shabbos HaGodol, Shabbos Shuva, and others are not named after what we read in the Parsha.</p>\n\n<p>An explanation would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Also note that the haftorah for this parsha involves the song of devorah (although I can't say if that came before or after)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070816194123/www.math.wustl.edu/~msh210/halacha_shira.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">elsewhere</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ספר התודעה asks a similar question, and gives a beautiful answer:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Not only שירת הים is in this פרשה; many other ideas are.... Nonetheless, the Jewish people has designated that this שבת be named specifically after the שירה, for this שירה was for Jews throughout the generations as if they were then saying it. Why so? Because whereas ה׳ spoke the entire Torah, and the Jews listened, here the Jews spoke and ה׳ and all His hosts listened....</p>\n    \n    <p>For with the strength of the שירה that they then sang, they planted שירה and joy in the heart of every Jew, for all time; every time they are saved from their enemies and granted reprieve from their troubles, their hearts sing... to ה׳ Who saved them.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>On another note, ספר אהל משה, by Rabbi Moshe Rosen of New York, notes that this week should not, by rights, be called שבת שירה merely because we read the שירה. After all, we read the שירה on a daily basis, so what makes this day special? Further, it can't be called שבת שירה because we commemorate the miracle of the sea now — we do that on the seventh of פסח, the anniversary of the crossing.</p>\n  \n  <p>He answers that the reason the Jews sang at that point — even though a trip through the deadly desert was still before them — was that they trusted that ה׳ would take care of them. \"ויאמינו בה׳ ובמשה עבדו, אז ישיר...‏\". So we refer only to this day as שבת שירה, as this is the only day on which we also read all the troubles that they went through in the desert. (Every day, when we read the שירה, we read it alone, without recalling the hardships of the desert.) When we read it this week, it strengthens our own בטחון. (We do not call the seventh of פסח by the name יום שירה because we do not need to strengthen our בטחון, as we are שרויִם [בשמחה]‏ and have בטחון.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However this is the only Shabbos that has a special name simply because of what we read in the Parsha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also the only <em>parasha</em> that has an extremely visible, long, brick-formatted, column-widening song right in the middle of it. I think the specialness of the name matches the specialness of the Torah reading. My only source for this is my intuition.</p>\n\n\n",

According to the Maharsha 26b, even Rabbi Yose b' R' Chanina, who holds tefilos keneged avos tiknum, also held of k'neged korbanos tiknun, but Chazal would not have established the tefilos at those korbanos times if not for the original tefilos established by the Avos who fulfilled the pasuk of erev vavoker v'tzaharayim asicha... So it could be that absent the times of chazal, the halacha would revert to 3x/day even without hard zemanim.  Although the pasuk says specifically evening, morning and afternoon, it's possible to say that's lav davka as Tosfos proves that Yaakov davened maariv during the day (for Tosfos a proof that the halacha is like R' Yehuda).  Lulei mistafina midivrei Tosfos, I would have said the timing mentioned in the pasuk is lav davka (and this is how the rabanan who argue w/ R\"Y would answer Tosfos' question).</p>\n\n<p>Krias Shema is a little fuzzier.  Are the zemanim of 3 hours, etc. mideoraysa, or applications of Uvshochb'cha uvkumecha.  In other words, can we say in absence of zemanim, we revert to shechiva and kima of your time zone?  It seems acc. to the opinions above that that wouldn't be the case.</p>\n\n\n",

Personally, I was always mystified by this and just put it out of my mind, but now I'd like to ask about it.</p>\n\n<p>Do people actually do this, or do most people just go to the bathroom in the normal way?  Are there any tshuvas about this, one way or the other?</p>\n\n<p>It's just hard for my to fathom people I know doing this...

    "content": "# Is swimming unclothed ok?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Historically \"bathing suits\" are a relatively new phenomenon... all swimming / bathing in rivers / lakes / seas was unclothed.  Culturally things have changed but does that affect halacha?  There seem to be places in the Gemara which mention swimming without saying anything about the unclothed issue.  The question assumes that it is in a place where one would not be observed (i.e. deserted area in nature or one's own backyard pool)</p>\n\n<p>However, when you contrast this with the strict halachos about being covered in the bathroom, it seems to be a contradiction.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I'm not so sure that the premise of the question (\"all swimming... was unclothed\") is necessarily correct. If you look back a century or so - on the contrary, their idea of \"bathing suits\" was actually clothing that covered all, or at least most, of the body. That may well have been true in earlier times too.</p>\n\n<p>In halachah, we find a discussion about crossing a river on Yom Kippur (Yoma 77b, and from there in Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 613:5); there are cases when one is allowed to walk through water up to his neck (despite the prohibition against bathing on that day), \"provided that he doesn't stick his hands out from under the hem of his garment.\" If I'm understanding this correctly, a person in this situation on weekdays would typically raise up the bottom of his robe to chest level or so, drape it over his arms, and walk through the water; whereas nowadays we might expect a person in such a situation to take his clothes off and carry them on his head. Granted that this is talking about walking rather than swimming, it still seems to show that it was quite normal to go into the water at least partially clothed.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, of course, people commonly bathed in rivers and ponds, and naturally they'd do so naked. Shulchan Aruch Harav (Mahadura Basra 2:4), summarizing information from the Gemara (Shabbos 41b), Magen Avraham (2:4), and Pri Megadim (2:4), says that (a) it's not a problem, any more so than in a bathhouse; (b) one should undress and re-dress as close to the riverbank as possible, so as to minimize unnecessary nudity; (c) a man shouldn't cover his privates when going down into the river, since that makes it seem like he's embarrassed about being circumcised; (d) on the other hand, he should cover them (with his hand, or by crouching) when he comes out of the river, since then he's facing other people.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it sounds like skinny-dipping isn't necessarily a problem, provided that standards of tznius are maintained out of the water.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Whats the problem? </p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between going to the bathroom and swimming. In the bathroom you are uncovered if you uncover yourself. In the lake or ocean or wherever you swim you are covered with water. You can even make a Bracha while in a Mikva as ladies do when they are Toivel.</p>\n\n\n",

Because it's not something that you would be using on the sabbath, it probably would be considered muktzah, but the type you can 'use' for a permitted activity. For example, if you want to keep a door open, you can use the package as a doorstop. In this sense, you can move it to a different location. But it should not be placed somewhere where you'll be prompted to pick it up again (i.e. don't put it in the middle of the floor, where you'll want to pick it up and put it on a table).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The best thing to do is tell him to put it down inside.

He was uniquely qualified to do so, as his era's prime expert on all idolatrous deities (i.e., manifestations of materiality), who would now come and acknowledge that G-d creates and maintains all of existence.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've also heard another explanation whose source I don't now recall (it's sort of similar to a comment in footnote 33 there, but taking a somewhat different tack):</p>\n\n<p>After the crossing of the Yam Suf, all of the nations of the world were deeply impressed by the display of G-d's power, and were afraid to attack His people.

If even after such an awesome demonstration as the Splitting of the Sea it's still possible for there to be an Amalek who ignores the whole thing - why, then, this shows that one can't just be impressed by it and remain as he was; sooner or later this excitement will evaporate, cool off, and then one may descend to the level of an Amalek.

The number seven represents the completion of the seven day process in which earth was created. During these seven days, the earth revolved on its axis seven times. Since marriage reenacts the creative process, the Kallah's encirclement symbolizes the repetition of these seven rotations. The Chosson is compared to a king.

If they defend themselves by saying to G-d 'If you had compelled us to accept the Torah as you compelled Am Yisroel...' then that can be answered by saying just as you didn't keep the Sheva Mitzvos B'nei Noach you wouldn't have kept the Torah either.

I was told by a colleague that he did so after seeing the process in the factory.  The vegetable would be spun and drained and spun again.  If any bugs were found after the second spin, the batch would be tossed since if any bugs were found, people would stop buying the brand.

A theophoric name is one which contains the name of Hashem. Often, these names begin with Yeho- or end with -yahu, and Yo can be a shorthand for it. It is <em>possible</em> that Yosef was not initially intended as such a theophoric name (depending on what \"ushmi Hashem lo nadati lahem\" means). I've claimed that Yehoshua was the first such theophoric name. Depending on the original intention, this is either a revealing of the initial meaning (Yosef <em>Hashem</em> li ben acher) or a reanalysis (Yosef as Yosef Hashem) in a poetic context in Tehillim.</p>\n\n<p>For more in-depth discussion of this, see here:\n<a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2006/07/parshat-shelach-earlier-theophoric.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parsha.blogspot.com/2006/07/parshat-shelach-earlier-theophoric.html</a>\nand earlier, in the post and comment section here:\n<a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2006/06/late-parshat-shelach-names-of-spies-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://parsha.blogspot.com/2006/06/late-parshat-shelach-names-of-spies-in.html</a></p>\n\n<p>kol tuv,</p>\n\n<p>josh</p>\n\n\n",

I would think not.

I'd refer you to the Tur, and actually to the Mechaber in the previous seif:\nטוב מעט תחנונים בכוונה, מהרבות בלא כוונה.</p>\n\n<p>So this might be an assessment. If you can have better kavvana by davening slowly and so being able to focus on your words, then it might be better to do this than to daven up the korbanos and then psukei dezimra. Of course, if you have the time and the patience, say everything slowly and with kavana.

As Rabbi Yossi said (Talmud, Shabbos 118b) “May my portion be among those who eat Shalosh Seudos”.</p>\n\n<p>So Minhag Chabad is to make sure to taste something for Shalosh Seudos, and the reason why they don’t wash for bread is because of the Posuk “Hayom Lo”.</p>\n\n<p>What this means is as follows: The Gemarah in Shabbos learns out the obligation to eat 3 meals of Shabbos from the following Posuk: “And Moshe said, eat [the Monn] today (Hayom), because today (Hayom) is a Shabbos for Hashem, today you will not (Hayom Lo) find [the Monn] in the field”. Since the Pasuk says the word “Hayom” 3 times (when speaking about the Monn which served them as bread), we learn that one must eat 3 meals on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the words of Rabbeinu Bechayei the Tzemach Tzedek rules (Piskei Dinim Chiddushim on Rabbeinu Yerucham p. 357) that since this meal is learned from the words “Hayom Lo”, unlike the first two meals which are learned from the word “Hayom”, we don’t need to eat bread for Shalosh Seudos, unlike the first two meals.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -7)\n\n<p>The reason is (perhaps) due to the fight between the two potential successors of the \"previous Rebbe\" of Chabad.

He also called into question whether having a plastic cup in the first place was really a problem, since people do refill them and even wash and save them.  Since the point of plastic cups is that they <em>could</em> be thrown away, he suggested it was better to use something more permanent, but he did not feel it invalidated the Kiddush to use a single plastic cup.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R.

Many Torah luminaries maintain that one should not seek philosophical proofs of G-d's existence.

For He is exceedingly close to you from the side of\n  His deeds but infinitely remote in any representation of His essence\n  or comparison with it. As already stated, we will never be able to\n  find Him in this way. When you arrive at the stage where you abandon\n  (trying to find Him) through your thoughts and senses because He\n  cannot be grasped in this way, and you instead find Him in the\n  evidence of His deeds, as though He were inseparable from you - this\n  is the pinnacle of knowledge of Him which the prophet exhorts us on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>ANOTHER UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>from Rabbi Mattityahu Solomon's recently published commentary to chovos halevavos (gate 2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The custom practiced in the yeshiva world is not to study the Shaar\n  Yichud. And even though, there is no doubt whatsoever that all of what\n  he says there is absolute truth, nevertheless, his words are of\n  philosophical inquiry and this inherently leads to many questions in\n  the mind of the person studying them, and not every person is capable\n  of fully understanding them. It is possible therefore that one could\n  remain with unresolved questions, or at least with doubts, that would\n  not have occured to him had he not studied this work. Therefore, it is\n  customary to walk simply and accept as a given, simple faith that the\n  Creator is One. And the explanation of One is that there is no power\n  in the world besides Him, no place in the world devoid of Him, and\n  nothing in the world without Him.

There's a general rule in the Shulchan Aruch that between  a stam and a yesh omrim the halacha is like the stam, but Sephardi acharonim spill a lot of ink explaining why the halacha in this particular case follows the yesh omrim.</p>\n\n<p>The Rema, on the other hand says outright that the minhag for Ashkenazim is to rely on the yesh omrim.</p>\n\n<p>So I don't really see why you want make a distinction between gas stoves and coals. If you're machmir not to leave food on the stove without a blech, it's just that: a chumra, even with coals. If you're looking for grounds to be meikil, there's grounds even with coals.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to have indeed been written by Ibn Ezra. If I had to identify the commentator whom Ibn Ezra is criticizing without identifying, I would say that it is the Rashbam. See <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/tnh_text.asp?id=130\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, where Rashbam says precisely this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויהי ערב ויהי בקר - \n  אין כתיב כאן ויהי לילה ויהי יום, אלא ויהי ערב, שהעריב יום ראשון ושיקע האור, ויהי בוקר, בוקרו של לילה, שעלה עמוד השחר, הרי הושלם יום א' מן השישה ימים שאמר הקב\"ה בעשרת הדברות, ואח\"כ התחיל יום שני, ויאמר אלהים יהי רקיע. ולא בא הכתוב לומר שהערב והבקר יום אחד הם, כי לא הוצרכנו לפרש אלא היאך היו ששה ימים, שהבקיר יום ונגמרה הלילה, הרי נגמר יום אחד והתחיל יום שני. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Erev is defined as the boundary time after a period of light, and boker is the boundary time after a period of darkness. Thus, it <strong>became</strong> evening and it <strong>became</strong> morning, and at that point, the second day began.

    "content": "# Rachav's home in the wall\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Rachav</em>'s home was built into the wall of <em>Y'richo</em>, with an outward-facing window (<em>Y'hoshua</em> 2:15, <em>M'tzudas David</em>). This window had to be recognizable when the Jews destroyed the city, so they'd know to spare the people in her home (2:18). But the walls of the city came down <em>before</em> the Jews destroyed the city and spared whoever was in <em>Rachav</em>'s home (6:20–23). What's going on?</p>\n\n<p>(One can perhaps answer that, as the wall sank into the earth rather than \"tumbling down\" (as the song says) (<em>Radak</em> 6:26), perhaps <em>Rachav</em>'s home sank as part of it, the rope that distinguished her home was visible above the earth (as its bottom end didn't sink into the earth), and they got her out through her ceiling (which she had access through, per 2:6). But that seems a slight stretch, and I'd love a source for it — or for another solution to this seeming contradiction.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Biur haGra- she had 2 \"houses\", 1  inside the wall (bachoma) and another within the city against the wall (B'kir hachoma).  It was in the latter that she stayed when the wall was razed as that was her main house (Beisa bkir hachoma).   The one inside the wall was a place to hang out (yosheves- at times)</p>\n\n<p>The Radak makes the same point without the 2nd house necessarily being attached to the wall, just in the city.</p>\n\n<p>The Malbim takes a similar approach (without any of the above inferences), but says it was one house that protruded out of the wall and into the city.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't know if there's any source for the following, but perhaps it's just this:</p>\n\n<p>The red string was tied in the window in order to mark the house. When the wall came down, of course the window - and the string with it - disappeared, but the Jews could still remember easily enough which house it was (especially if indeed it was the only one built into the wall). The wall coming down didn't necessarily destroy Rachav's house as a whole - it had three other sides, after all; it just would have been something like <a href=\"http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/images/marib08.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> (first example I could find). So Rachav and her family were still inside the house, and Pinchas and Kalev were able to go and bring them out from there.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/37\">Alex</a> notes in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5471/rachavs-home-in-the-wall/5472#comment-6400\">a comment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 6:5 Radak explains that not the entire wall fell, just the part that was facing the Jewish army - while Rachav's house was on a different side of the city.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As you've mentioned, one explanation is that you shouldn't be seasick on Shabbos, so give yourself a few days to gain your sea legs!</p>\n\n<p>Another answer is that being on a boat (and by extension, elective surgery) is putting yourself into a situation where you may need to violate Shabbos due to life-and-death circumstances. Now certainly once you're in such a situation, you are absolutely obligated to save a life; but it's less than ideal to choose to put yourself in such a situation to begin with. According to this explanation of the Mishna, however, you only need to think about \"what situation am I putting myself in\" if you're within three days of Shabbos. Any earlier, and it's not your responsibility. (Similarly, if the trip is needed for a mitzva purpose, there is an argument to allow it even within the 3 days, as that wins out over the halachic strong preference of <em>don't-put-yourself-in-a-situation-where-you-may-be-obligated-to-violate-Shabbos.</em></p>\n\n\n",

The Biur Halacha there notes that this should only be done by someone who actually saw such a dream.

Based on this logic, one would only say it on the first day of pesach, shavuot and rosh hashana as all the other times are so close that the above assumption can't really be made (unless you know you saw such a dream where even the next day you say it again). (It's possible that sukkot would be included as it is two weeks away. Or Maybe even Yom Kippur. The boundary is not so clear.)

So that leaves being <em>inviting</em> as a strategy.  I've heard this called \"meeting them where they are\".</p>\n\n<p>When he's in town, invite your friend for Shabbat dinner or a Purim party or a Lag b'Omer cookout or anything else.  Food and good company are great ways to participate without feeling \"too religious\".  (Granted, Shabbat dinner will have religious aspects.)  I realize this doesn't work so well for you because your friend isn't local, but I mention it for the sake of those for whom that's not a constraint.  (Maybe it won't be for you in the future.)</p>\n\n<p>In addition (and you can do this at a distance):\n<em>in the course of your normal interactions</em> with your friend, mention anything Jewish that you've done/learned/heard recently that he might be interested in -- a new recording, an interesting (accesisble) lecture, a neat thing you discovered in Tanach, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/12760/472\">Jewish implications of modern calendar changes</a>, or anything at all.  It has to be something <em>you</em> are interested in; don't fake it.</p>\n\n<p>Your goal here (in addition to the actual conversation, which I hope is interesting in its own right) is to plant seeds.  Maybe something the two of you talk about will make him curious about something.  Maybe he'll ask you about it, and then you'll have another conversation about a Jewish topic.  This is a slow process, but that's ok -- you can't rush these things and anything you do that moves him in the direction of more interest in his Judaism helps.</p>\n\n<p>And, as suggested by Gershon, never lie or mislead him.  That doesn't mean you need to say \"hey, I'm doing this to get you engaged with your Judaism\" in every conversation, but don't try to be sneaky.  Don't invite him for a casual weeknight dinner and then surprise him with a bunch of people from your talmud shiur, for instance.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, the very best thing you can do to help somebody else care about his Judaism is to care about yours.  Being a role model, even in what you think of as \"small\" things, can be a <em>huge</em> factor.  I recently <a href=\"http://cellio.livejournal.com/959729.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learned</a> of how an off-hand comment I made 10+ years ago helped move someone toward keeping Shabbat, for instance -- and I had no idea until I ran into him again years later.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Look into what outreach resources there are in his area.

It was assumed that the average \"grown-up\" child, in most cases, could fend for themselves (including begging, if needed), thus there is no blanket obligation to support one's adult family. In the unfortunate case that they would not be able to do so, then their charitable cause would have priority over a random stranger's. <strong>All else being equal</strong>, is how I read it.</p>\n\n<p>There are cases where people will use their received charity simply unwisely; sadly there are cases where it would actually be self-detrimental. It should be remembered that the goal here is to help people, and sometimes the best way to do so is to say \"no.\" The Talmud says the reward for truly helping someone sick (which may involve changing their bandages and hearing them scream, or being called all sorts of names because you won't give in to their pleas for a cigarette) is <em>friends like <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b05.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Na'aman's</a>, who got him cured [by telling him <strong>no</strong>], and not friends like <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rehoboam's yes-men</a> who caused him to lose half his kingdom.</em></p>\n\n<p>I think each case may have to be decided on its own merits; a rabbi who understands the particulars of the situation may be helpful, and lastly, it's possible that certain questions of tzedaka prioritization are actually up to the giver's sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Gemara says that when you give a person charity, if he is used to eating expensive meat then you should give him according to what he is accustomed to.

When I told him why, he suggested that it would be better to interrupt my Tehillim to come to Shi'ur on time, because the source we have for the power of Tehillim is a Midrash that says that David HaMelech asked HaShem to receive Tehillim the way He receives Talmud Torah (ie., to make the recitation of Tehillim as powerful as Talmud Torah). The Midrash does not tell us whether or how HaShem responded. Hence, Talmud Torah is <em>at least</em> as powerful as Tehillim.

Od Adaber).</p></li>\n  <li><p>Because both foods are (usually) already cooked, some authorities\n  maintain there is no longer a\n  prohibition of cooking meat and milk\n  (see Chasam Sofer YD 82; Pri Toar\n  87:3; Aruch Hashulchan 87:13; Machazik\n  Berachah 87:12).</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>The combination of the factors above\n  would seem sufficient to permit the\n  use of a single garbage bin for meat\n  and milk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Lchatchila it is not recommended even directly down the drain.

It is not batel.

Without the halacha of Gud Asik, if I through a towel from a reshus harabim to the top of the pole, I would be patur from a korban since it never landed in the reshus hayachid - its above the walls.

Most practically, people put the sechach within 3 tephachim and use a different halacha called lavud to halachically eliminate the space.  With gud asik you can use, say, gazebo walls that are 10 tefachim high and through the sechach on a frame 15 feet high and if the imaginary line drawn upward from the walls hits the edge of the sechach (or w/i 3 tefachim), your walls halachicaly reach your sechach.

Do they still know they are Jewish? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Yevamos 16b-17a) cites a couple of opinions that bear on this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>\"If a non-Jew nowadays performs <em>kiddushin</em> with a Jewish woman, we have to be concerned that these kiddushin are valid [and they need to be dissolved with a <em>get</em>], since he may be from the Ten Tribes.\" [The Gemara goes on to qualify this: it applies only if he's from the areas where the Ten Tribes were exiled, as listed in II Kings 17:6.] The implication, then, is that they assimilated among the local non-Jews.</p></li>\n<li><p>The people in these locations are considered out-and-out non-Jews. Even though the exiled Jews there included women [whose children ought to be considered Jews, as per the usual rule that Jewishness follows the mother], either all of these women became infertile, or there was an explicit ruling by the halachic authorities of that time that they were to be considered non-Jews. [How exactly that would work - don't we always say that a Jew remains a Jew no matter what? - is the subject of a lot of discussion among the posekim.]</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On the other hand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Already shortly after the Ten Tribes seceded and formed their own kingdom, we find members of those tribes - those who wanted to continue being able to worship Hashem in the Beis Hamikdash - moving south to the Kingdom of Judah and remaining there (II Chron. 11:16).</p></li>\n<li><p>Some 90 years after the exile of the Ten Tribes, the prophet Yirmiyahu (Jeremiah) brought a lot of them back to the Land of Israel, where they became subjects of King Yoshiyahu (Josiah) of Judah (Megillah 14b, Erchin 33a). They shared the fate of the Judeans a couple of decades later, in being exiled to Babylonia, but they retained their identity as Jews.</p></li>\n<li><p>Of the 42,360 people who left Babylonia to come to the Land of Israel and build the second Beis Hamikdash, about 13,000 were from the Ten Tribes (Rashi to Ezra 2:64, quoting Seder Olam Rabbah).</p></li>\n<li><p>According to some opinions, the Ten Tribes will be restored along with the rest of the Jewish People when Moshiach comes (Sanhedrin 110b). Rashi there (ד\"ה כיום הזה) cites his teacher as saying (if I'm understanding him correctly) that even R' Akiva, who says that they are gone forever, is talking about the original exiles, but that even he would agree that their descendants have a future as part of the Jewish People.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yechezkel (Ezekiel) describes how the Ten Tribes (whom he calls \"the stick of Joseph... and his fellow tribes\") will rejoin the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (\"the stick of Judah\") and they will re-form one kingdom (37:15ff). He also describes the borders of the land that will be re-divided \"for the twelve tribes of Israel\" (47:13), and gives the details of how the tribes' lands will be arranged (48:1-7 and 23-28). So all twelve tribes will indeed exist as defined units in the era of Moshiach.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

(The actual number of calendar years would obviously have been a lot less than 430 according to this approach, since there's no reason to assume that any of them were born around the time of their father's death.)</p>\n\n\n",

The pastries are supposed to symbolize the defeated enemy of the Jewish people, and thus resemble the \"ears of Haman\". A more likely source of the name is a corruption of the Yiddish word מאן־טאשן (<em>montashn</em>) or the German word mohntaschen, both meaning poppyseed-filled pouches. Over time, this name was transformed to Hamantaschen, likely by association with Haman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A reason mentioned for eating hamentashen is the meaning of the word – hamentashen, since Haman wanted to kill us out and Hashem weakened him and prevented him from doing evil to us. Thus, the treat is called המן תש (Hamen became weakened). In addition eating these pastries shows our faith that the same result will befall all our antagonists.[Avraham Eliezer Hershkowitz, Otzar Kol Minhaghei Yeshrun (St. Louis, 1918), p. 131. See also R. Cohen in his book Puirm VChodesh Adar, pp. 116-117 and R. Kamile, Shar Reveun, p. 206.]</p>\n\n<p>HaRav Yaakov Kamenetsky ZATZAL offers another reason for eating hamentashen on Purim. Eating is a form of destroying, as you are destroying the item being eaten. Therefore, in eating hamentashen, we are figuratively fulfilling the commandment of destroying Amalek as we are eating Hamen.[Yaakov Michoel Jacobs, Bemechitzas Rabbeinu: Hagaon Rav Yaakov Kamenetzky, zt\"l (Feldheim, 2005), p. 142.]</p>\n\n<p>Yom Tov Lewinsky and Professor Dov New have both suggested that the reason for eating the hamentashen is because the custom in the Middle Ages was to cut off the ears of someone who was being hung,[Yom Tov Lewinsky, Sefer Hamoadim (pp. 153-154); Dov New, Machanaim # 43. This source is also quoted by Ben Yehuda in his dictionary under the entry Aznei.] to remember this we eat pastries from which a part had been cut off. Also mentioned by both of these authors is an opinion that the filling in the pastries [this is specific to poppy\nseeds] is in remembrance to the 10,000 silver coins that Haman offered to contribute to Achashverosh's coffers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2008/03/origins-of-hamentashen-in-jewish.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://seforim.blogspot.com/2008/03/origins-of-hamentashen-in-jewish.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a Hebrew play written in Hebrew Yehudah Sommo (1527- 1592) from Italy.

First, it is no longer relevant, as, even if we build, we will build a Beis Hamikdash. Plus, the Medrashim say it will be pre-made anyway?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Whether the third Beis Hamikdash will be pre-built is in fact the subject of a dispute among the Rishonim. Rashi (Sukkah 41a, ד\"ה אי נמי) says that it will come down from Heaven ready-made; on the other hand, Rambam (Hil. Melachim 11:4) lists the building of the Beis Hamikdash as one of the things that Moshiach will accomplish (in fact, that he needs to do in order to be considered the definite Moshiach). There is also a famous reconciliation of these two opinions (I believe I've seen it attributed to R' Yehoshua Leib Diskin, the Brisker Rav) is that the building as a whole will come down from Heaven, but it will be up to us to put in the gates.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, though, even Rashi might agree that the vessels and utensils of the third Beis Hamikdash have to be made by human hands. In his commentary to Ex. 25:9 (ד\"ה וכן תעשו) he cites a couple of places where the Gemara explains that the instructions given in the Torah are indeed for all time: whenever one of the vessels needs to be replaced (or additional ones need to be made), they are to follow the patterns given here. So much of the description has practical value for that reason alone.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from all that, though, there is a great deal we learn from the details of the Mishkan's construction:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In halachah, we know what we may not do on Shabbos by looking at the activities that had to be done to build the Mishkan and its components.</p></li>\n<li><p>The blueprint of the Mishkan in fact serves as the pattern for how to make ourselves and our world into a \"dwelling-place for G-d in the lower realms.\" (In Chassidic writings this is associated with the previous point: our weekday activities, consisting of the same 39 categories of work done during the construction of the Mishkan, are indeed meant to turn this world into a Divine home on earth, of which the Mishkan was an example.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Indeed, there is an idea (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A8_%D7%90/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">נפש החיים שער א פרק ד</a>) that the Mishkan in fact represented, in its design and layout, the various parts of the human being's physical and spiritual makeup, and was also a microcosm of the universe.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

He starts by explaining that \"Canaan\" literally means \"merchant\" (as in Hos. 12:8 and Is. 23:8), and continues:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן היתה ארץ כנען בטרם בא ישראל אליה\n  כי היתה ארץ שוקטת ולא היתה עובדת לשום\n  מלך אחר... אבל אחר שבאו ישראל לארץ\n  כנען היתה נותנת מס ועובדת מלכים אחרים\n  בסורם מאחרי השם</p>\n  \n  <p>\"The Land of Canaan, too, before the\n  Jews came to it, was a peaceful\n  country, not subject to any other\n  king...

He doesn't elaborate, but I think I recall seeing an idea (probably somewhere in Chassidus) that the Torah calls the Land by this name because it is a prototype of what we are to accomplish: to take the \"land of Canaan,\" in both the specific and the general meanings of this term, and turn it into a holy land.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

(Though see the Gemara in Gittin Chapter 1, and Tosfos' commentary ...)</p>\n\n<p>The first set is the Biblical borders, as given in <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=34\">Numbers Chapter 34</a>. The southern border is <em>nahal mitzraim</em>, generally translated as Wadi El Arish. Many printed translations of the Torah now include a map representing these borders according to the view of rabbinic cartographers such as <em>Kaftor VaFerach.</em></p>\n\n<p>The second, much smaller borders, are found in the Talmud, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h36.htm\">Mishnah Gittin 1:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From Rekem and eastward, including Rekem [is not Israel]; from Ashkelon and southward, including Ashkelon; from Ako and northward; Rabbi Yehudah considers Ako itself outside, Rabbi Meir disagrees. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The latter borders are the ones that define, for instance, \"the land of Israel\" with regards to agricultural laws such as tithes (<em>terumot umaasrot</em>) and the requirement for a sabbatical year (<em>shemitah</em>). </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/710777/Rabbi_Hershel_Schachter/The_Gaza_Disengagement-A_Torah_Perspective,_a_non_political_view_\">his yutorah.org lecture on halachic issues related to the Gaza Disengagement</a>, Rabbi Hershel Schachter points out that Gaza is within the Biblical borders (north of Wadi el Arish) but outside the Talmudic borders (south of Ashkelon). The halachic implications of that are a very lengthy discussion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Well <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5701/what-are-the-halachic-boundaries-of-eretz-yisroel\">there are Biblical borders, and then there are the Talmudic borders</a>. (Much of your question is addressed there). The Talmudic northern border is Ako (as given in Mishna Gittin Ch. 1). The Biblical northern border is addressed by <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 34:7--9</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>34:7  This shall be your northern boundary. From the Mediterranean Sea, draw a line to Hor Mountain.</p>\n  \n  <p>34:8    From Hor Mountain draw a line along the Chamath Highway, so that the extreme edge of the boundary is toward Tzedad.</p>\n  \n  <p>34:9    The border shall then extend through Zifron, with its extreme end at Chatzar Eynan. This shall be your northern border.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan identifies \"Chamath Highway\" as the modern-day Homa, Syria. See his commentary for more. Most of the other locations identified by Rabbi Kaplan's translation can be found on Wikipedia and/or Google Maps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a grandparent name a child differently than the parents?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We all know that Moshe Rabeinu had 7 names and was called Moshe which was the name Basya gave him. Recently I was in a Shul and there was a fellow there that had a grandaughter the previous week. The child was named by the parents however the grandfather was unhappy with the name they gave. <strong>(I do not recommend that anyone should do this.)</strong> The grandfather wanted an Aliyah and wanted to give a different name. The Gabbai smartly forgot to give the grandfather an Aliyah and avoided the unhealthy consequences of doing this. </p>\n\n<p>My question is - does it work? Suppose the grandparent gave a different name than the parents or anyone else for that matter does this child now have additional names?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a great question, which no doubt has great ramifications. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that there is a general assumption that for any \"Ḥaloth Shem\", as it were (no pun intended), there needs to be a Kinyan. In plain English, that means that for Halachah to recognize a status change in anything there needs to be a formal act of acquisition. Since a name isn't conferred in this way, my gut (and my brain) tells me that, along the lines of YDK's point, while a naming ceremony is important for demonstrating the \"official\" point of origin for a name (perhaps useful in a case of doubt), the actual name that is used is what has the most Halachic weight. If that is true, then in a case of controversy, if two names are declared in competing \"official\" declarations, either by divorced parents or just arguing family members, the name that is used throughout the person's life would be the one that \"counts\". If they are both adopted by the person at some point, it might be of some Halachic importance to try to determine - probably with yet a third naming ceremony later on - what the proper order of the names is, or if one is to be regarded as a nickname. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Please see the following link for an article by Rebbi UMori R' Mordechai Friedman discussing change of status via Kinyan (specifically in the case of a Jewish wedding).  <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/kiddushin/07kiddushin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vbm-torah.org/archive/kiddushin/07kiddushin.htm</a>.  My previous assumption that there cannot be Ḥaloth Shem without Kinyan may be incorrect, according to this article, but it may shed some light and further corroborate (or possibly reject) the idea I presented, namely that baby naming is something outside the realm of standard Ḥaloth Shem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The naming of a child merely announces that that's what he should be called by people.  Halachically, it boils down to what people actually call him, and not what the gabbai said after vikarei shmo b'yisrael...  (From my experiences with gittin)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No source but logically, the grandfather has no naming rights, therefore his naming of the child is null and void. Nevertheless, if the grandfather's name sticks and people call the child with that name, then it is no different than any nickname which does have validity, for example with respect to writing a Get.</p>\n\n<p>In the Torah we find <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0135.htm#18\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yakov giving a different name to Binyamin after he was already named by his mother</a>. I assume that was because naming rights belong to the father, but I need to look at the sources there.</p>\n\n\n",

Why are the Jews last?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The verses immediately before this (vv. 18ff) describe segments of Egyptian society recognizing Hashem and coming to serve Him: \"there will be five cities in the land of Egypt... which swear by G-d's name... there shall be an altar to G-d within the land of Egypt... for they will have cried out to G-d because of their oppressors, and He will send them a great person who saves them... and Egypt will know G-d on that day.\"</p>\n\n<p>Most of the classic commentaries refer this prophecy to the aftermath of Sennacherib's failure to conquer Jerusalem, due to the miraculous destruction of his army (as described in Isaiah 37:36 and II Kings 19:35). Egypt had also been menaced by the Assyrians, and indeed some Egyptians had been taken as hostages and thus were present to witness the event; the display of G-d's power impressed them so much that they (semi-)converted to Judaism and began to worship Him.</p>\n\n<p>So the verses you quoted follow from that. There will come a time, Yeshayahu is saying, when instead of Egypt and Assyria being rival superpowers, with the Land of Israel a buffer between them (and a frequent target of invasion from both sides), all three countries will join in a pact of friendship, in which they will all serve Hashem together. Israel will be \"a third\" member of this union, recognized as co-equal in importance with the others, rather than a vassal state as it so often was.</p>\n\n<p>The last verse is variously explained. According to the translation you used, it means that once this happens, Egypt and Assyria will deserve the exalted titles of, respectively, \"My people\" and \"the work of My hands,\" for their recognition of G-d; nevertheless, the Jewish People will retain their special status as having been \"My heritage\" all along (Radak, Metzudas David). An alternative understanding is that Egypt and Assyria will declare that they now realize the uniqueness of the Jewish People and their special relationship with G-d - i.e., it should be translated, \"Egypt [will declare] 'Blessed is My people,' Assyria [will recognize the Jews as] 'the work of My hands,' and Israel [will be, as it has always been] My heritage\" (Targum Yonasan, Rashi, Malbim).</p>\n\n<p>I haven't found anyone who says that this refers to events that are to precede Moshiach's coming. However, since as far as I know the situation described in vv. 23-25 has never yet happened, I think it's a logical inference that at least some of this chapter is so. Whether what's happening now is part of that, or a prelude to it - only Hashem knows. We can speculate, but ultimately our job is to make sure that if indeed this is a harbinger of Moshiach's arrival - and by rights, we should view everything that happens as so, since \"all of the set times [for the redemption] have already gone by\" (Sanhedrin 97b) - that it spurs us to prepare ourselves with teshuvah and good deeds, and reaching out to our fellow Jews to do the same.</p>\n\n\n",

According to R' YB Soloveichik, Shiurei HaRav Al Inyanei Aveilut V'Tisha B'Av, pp. 20-21, there is \"a basis for shaving one's beard during this period. He contends that the observances of the three week mourning period are patterned after the twelve month period of mourning that one observes when losing a parent. A mourner during this period may shave or cut his hair when he has reached a state that his friends note his unkempt appearance. Nowadays, when people shave on a daily basis, this state is attained after a day or two. Once that state is reached, one may shave his beard and continue to shave for the rest of the mourning period. However, this leniency will only apply to the three week period [and not to the nine days leading up to Tish'ah BeAv].\" - Quoted from: \"The Laws of Bein HaMetzarim\" [brackets added by me for clarification]\n<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/The%20Nine%20days.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/The%20Nine%20days.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The opinion of the Rav isn't the only one out there, but he is well known for this opinion, and the following anecdote may be the source for the (now) well established, and possibly erroneous, practice among Yeshivah Bahurim to shave every Friday during Sefirah but not during the week. (By the way, since I'm recalling this from memory, if anyone sees any factual errors in my version of the anecdote, please point them out in the comments!)</p>\n\n<p>When R' Aharon Lichtenstein became Rosh Yeshivah of Yeshivat Har Etzion, his father-in-law, RYB\"S, told him that his opinion (which I referenced above) probably ought not apply in Israel, since it was much more acceptable there to wear a few days' growth of facial hair. Since, because of RA\"L's position, he wanted to maintain a dignified look, the Rav advised him to shave Friday LiChvod Shabbath instead of daily. </p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, in my own opinion, even in Israel it is much more expected that one shave daily in the workplace. However, there still may be a problem for Bahurim to shave 'Erev Shabbath, since there is no societal expectation in a Yeshivah setting that one shave in the first place, much less during Sefirah or the Three Weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Now, getting to the workplace, assuming one has an expectation of looking well groomed during the week, then, borrowing from the Rav, it would seem it is appropriate to shave on Friday as well, just as one might if, Lo 'Aleinu, one were in the 12 month mourning period for a parent. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: <s>Unfortunately, the link at YU Torah to the Shi'ur where I found the quote is dead. If I find a new link online for the Shi'ur or for the quote, I will add it.</s></p>\n\n<p>The link now works. I will keep a copy of the Shi'ur on hand. If I can find a new site to host it, perhaps a blog, I will provide that link in a future version of this answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In O.C. Siman 551, the Rema, who extends the issurim of the week of tisha b'av to the previous Rosh chodesh, permits wearing \"linen garments\" for the honor of Shabbos. [ The Magen Avraham (14) extends this to washing clothes on Thursday for Shabbos.  The Magen Avraham  then brings the Darkei Moshe who says that the practice was not to wash in honor of Shabbos and implies the same for laundering.  The MA concludes that one may be lenient if he has no clothes for Shabbos and alternatively, one may have a non-Jew wash it for Shabbos.]</p>\n\n<p>At the end the MA quotes the Hagaos Ashri that haircuts are forbidden for Shabbos.  The MA says that the reason seems to be that we don't normally haircut \"every week\" (b'chol shavua).  The simple reading of this MA is that the HA holds that which is normally done weekly to honor shabbos is not restricted, and only forbids haircuts because they are not a weekly activity.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer wants to read the MA as we normally don't haircut except on erev shabbos (perhaps reading it similar to \"b'chol *ha*shavua), and it isn't recognizable that he is mourning if he continues to shave on erev shabbos.  To me, this would circumvent the DM, since the DM would only forbid once-a-week honors. (See the Chasam Sofer for a further heter for beards.)</p>\n\n<p>So, the Chasam Sofer (if he would sanction shaving year round), would permit shaving on Friday even during the 9 days, if the one shaving would shave more than once a week so that the mourning is recognizable. However, (it seems to me) if one is shaving daily for work, Friday would not be permitted since there, too, his mourning would not be recognizable.</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear whether the MA agrees to the CS's reading of himself, or if the MA would permit shaving as long as it was a normal erev shabbos activity.  I have only seen those who follow the Chasam Sofer's reading. </p>\n\n\n",

I do have the book, <em>Ozar Rashe Tevot</em> by Shmuel Ashkenazi and Dov Jarden (in Hebrew) and that has been very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>I may have to add to this question occasionally as I come across new ones. </p>\n\n<p>I have seen people listed as Rosh Hakehila (ראש הקהילה), which is probably like our president of the shul today.  But what would his functions have been?</p>\n\n<p>One that had me stumped for a while was <em>amad al mishmeret hakodesh</em> (עמד על משמרת הקודש). Fortunately, I was able to reach a sofer, Moshe Flumenbaum, who e-mailed me this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The phrase \"amad al mishmar hakodesh\"\nrelates to a sofer as follows A sofer\nis the person who makes sure that the\n\"kodesh\" (Torahs, Tefillin, and\nMezuzahs) are kosher and maintained.</blockquote>\n\n<p>The man was indeed a sofer, so this then made sense.</p>\n\n<p>How about Hanagid (הנגיד)? </p>\n\n<p>Another Issue is when a person is noted as being a descendent of the author of such-and-such, rather than by actual name.  A useful website that has been partially useful is: <a href=\"http://www.jewishgen.org/rabbinic/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jewishgen.org/rabbinic/</a>, in which one may find the name corresponding to the sefer.  As you can imagine, not all sefarim can be included and not all mechabrim are listed either.</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate it if someone could tell me what these functions or honorifics were. Also, if you have more to add, we could all benefit from sharing.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rosh Hakehilah is more than a shul president. He would have been a lay leader of the entire community (or a major portion of it), very likely representing them before the (non-Jewish) authorities when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>\"Amad al mishmeres hakodesh\" may indeed refer to a sofer (I don't believe I've ever heard of this usage before). But it can also be used more broadly for someone who upheld Judaism in the town - for example, a teacher or a rabbi (especially if they had to stand against heterodox opposition in the course of their work).</p>\n\n<p>Hanagid literally means \"the leader,\" and it often includes the connotation of being a wealthy person who contributed generously to charity.</p>\n\n\n",

Its very first word, ואתה, \"and you,\" expresses his existence even more strongly than the use of his name.</p>\n\n<p>He then goes on to explain what Moshe was trying to accomplish with his \"threat.\" He was demanding that G-d be willing to re-establish His relationship with the Jewish People on an essential level that transcends Torah, and that if He wouldn't be willing to do so, then Moshe was prepared to forfeit his place in the Torah in favor of retaining his connection with his people. Thus,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tetzaveh stands as an eternal tribute to Moses. It is the Torah’s own testimony to Moses’ greatness in relinquishing everything—including his bond with Torah—in order to preserve his bond with his people and restore them to their G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Baal HaTurim says that it was because Moshe said מְחֵנִי נָא מִסִּפְרְךָ אֲשֶׁר כָּתָבְתָּ (erase me now from Your book which You have written) in Parshas Ki Sisa. The question remains why Parshas Tetzaveh was chosen to erase his name. HaRav Shaul M'Vilna answers since Moshe said אֲשֶׁר כָּתָבְתָּ, past tense - therefore it was omitted in Parshas Tetzaveh, the parsha which comes before Ki Sisa. Another reason is that the Gematria of Asher is 501 which is also the Gematria of Tetzaveh. </p>\n\n<p>The Gra says that since most years Zayin Adar - 7 Adar comes out in Parshas Tetzaveh - Hashem who knows what is going to happen left his name out of this Parsha.</p>\n\n<p>In the Sefer Panayach Raza he mentions that since Moshe was originally supposed to be the Kohain Gadol, however he lost this privilege because he said to Hashem at the burning bush שְׁלַח-נָא בְּיַד-תִּשְׁלָח (send, I pray You, by the hand of him whom You will send) therefore in Parshas Tetzaveh which talks about the priestly garments he is not mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Source for all the above: Torah L'Daas Chelek 1</p>\n\n<p>I have heard in the name of the Ben Ish Chai that Moshe requested Michaini Na Misfracha. The word Misifracha can also read Mesefer Chaf - the 20th Sefer. Since Tetzave is the 20th Parsha therefore Hashem left it out of Tetzave as per Moshe's request.</p>\n\n<p>I do remember hearing that the reason is that Hashem did not want to erase Moshe's name, however since he requested it Hashem kept pushing it off until there was no more pushing it off, and therefore it is not mentioned in Parshas Tetzaveh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>On a peshat level:</p>\n\n<p>A parsha (actually a sidra) is the portion set up to read in a particular Shabbat, as set up in Bavel.

Per Koren the pronunciation is Bisya. So how did Bisya become Basya? The Yalkut Shimoni on this Posuk cites the following Medrash. Hashem said to the daughter of Pharoh \"Moshe was not your son however you called him your son, therefore though you are not my daughter I will call you my daughter\". Thus it follows that Bisya became Basya - the daughter of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The confusion seems to be relatively recent. Here is some history from Alexander Beider's <em>A Dictionary of Ashkenazic Given Names</em> (p478-9):</p>\n<p>The Ashkenazic female name Basye comes from Batsheva (בת שבע) via hypocorism (and Ashkenazic pronunciation): בת שבע > Basheve > Sheve/Bashe/Basye. Beider points out that the popularity of these variants of Batsheva were \"partly due to the existence of a Polish Christian name Basia, a hypocoristic form of Barbara (of Greek origin).\" He brings many examples of the name from name corpora.</p>\n<p>Regarding the Biblical name, Beider writes that the spelling בתיה \"can correspond to two independent names: First, to the biblical בִּתְיָה ‭(1 Chronicles 4:18; a daughter of Pharaoh)‬, pronounced Bisye in Yiddish. Second, it can represent a Hebraized spelling of the Yiddish name Basye, the spelling chosen in order to fit to the above biblical name.\" Beider brings examples of the Yiddish name Bisye, one of which is spelled ביתייה (which is clearly Bisye, not Basye).</p>\n<p>Beider cites a theory that a related name Pese is derived from בַּתְיָה, with the meaning \"daughter of God\", but rejects it. He notes that the spelling בתיה for Basye is unknown before the 17th century.</p>\n<p>Based on this, it seems to me that the pronunciation Basye for the daughter of Pharaoh is a later phenomenon, arising from the spelling בתיה for the name Basye of independent origin (from Batsheva). The pronunciation Bisye for the daughter of Pharaoh has roots both in Tanakh and even in Ashkenazic name lists (where you expect the confusion to be widespread), and should be taken as primary.</p>\n\n\n",

If there is not Is there a situation where you do?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The question of Kiddush on Yom Kippur is discussed first in the Gemara Eiruvin </p>\n\n<p>The Shibolei Haleket (312) writes that because one does not normally eat on Yom Kippur, the Sages never required mention of the holiday in kiddush or even bentching. In fact, making Kiddush would be improper because one might see kiddush being made and think that it should be done every year. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40432&st=&pgnum=297\">Shulchan Aruch (618:10)</a>, however, writes that mention of Yom Kippur should be made in bentching (i.e. say Yaaleh Veyavo) with the reasoning that because one would be bentching anyway and the same paragraph is said in the prayer. The Magen Avrahahm, Chayei Adam, and Mishnah Berurah (s.k. 29) all agree that one should not make kiddush on Yom Kippur if one is fasting. </p>\n\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2011/1053/756192.pdf\">a famous story</a> about Rav Yisrael Salanter who, on a Yom Kippur during a cholera epidemic, made sure to eat in shul in public in order so that everyone should know that eating that day was the right thing to do. Rav Baruch Epstein, in Mekor Baruch II chapter 11, records that Rav Salanter even made kiddush in shul. However, the linked article casts doubt on the story (without even bringing up the recording of R. Baruch Epstien, which I find to be a bit odd), and I've personally heard from Rav Asher Weiss that even if R. Yisrael Salanter did eat in public, he doesn't believe that he would have made kiddush on Yom Kippur against the psak of the Magen Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>The more interesting instance is when Yom Kippur falls out on Shabbos: even if there's no institution of kiddush for Yom Kipuur, there is for Shabbos, and perhaps one would be obligated to do so, especially considering that many hold that Kiddush on Shabbos is Biblically mandated. Thus, Rebi Akivah Eiger (in his comments to the Magen Avraham, O.C. 618:10) seems to suggest (it's unclear to me whether he would say so in practice) that if one must eat on a Yom Kippur that falls out on Shabbos, he should indeed make kiddush.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Shar HaKollel <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16002&st=&pgnum=338&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a> that there is no Kiddush on Yom Kippur, not on wine and not on bread, nor is there Lechem Mishne (taking two whole loaves for HaMotzi), because the Chachamim did not establish those things on Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva Eiger holds you should make Kiddush although most other Poskim say you should not.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer writes that you should have in mind Kiddush during Davening.</p>\n\n<p>I recall hearing that children should not make Kiddush on Yom Kippur as there is no Mitzva of Chinuch to teach them to make Kiddush for Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n\n",

In chapter 8 (p. 85-97), he discusses this very point, of being selective of what music one listens to. All emphasis placed in quotes are mine, and are meant to highlight the main points for those who don't wish to read through the whole thing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The tune</h2>\n<p>Hachsharas Ha'avreichim 9 (written by the Rebbe of Piasetzna):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold, we see great singers and musicians whose hearts are distant from HaShem, without belief and heart, Heaven spare us; and even among idol-worshippers there are musicians. For music is nothing but a form of exposing of the soul and its feelings. Yet, there is no determining what a person will do at the time that he brings out this feeling, and what he will accomplish with the part of his soul that has now become exposed.</p>\n<p>Just as there can be two joyous people, one channeling his joy to increase his service of HaShem, while the other just becomes wild, so, too, when it comes to music - one of the keys to the soul, to arouse it and its feelings. It is possible for a person to open his soul and to have some of it come out, yet not only does he not do anything with it, he instead sullies this portion of his soul, whether it is with joy-filled wildness or with the broken-heartedness of depression and despair. This could lead him to fall from his former trust and belief and to do things that may not be done, Heaven spare us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Rabbi Sandler's own words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>if a person listens to music and song from a musician whose essence is good and pure, he will connect with it and absorb sparks of that goodness and purity into his own essence and being.</strong> It will become part of who he is and, perhaps subconsciously, influence him for the better.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the converse is true as well. <strong>If a person listens to music from a musician or singer whose essence is not good and pure, then he will connect with that music and absorb sparks of decadence and impurity into his own essence.</strong> It will infiltrate and become part of who he is, and even subconsciously, influence him for the worse. <strong>One must therefore be exceedingly selective with the music and songs one listens to, and ascertain that it emanates from a person whose essence will have a positive influence on one's own.</strong> (p. 87)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rebbe of Modzhitz takes this a step further (Imrei Sha'ul, Inyanei Zimrah V'simcha 41):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My grandfather from Zvohlin, zt\"l, used to say, \"A person is taking a heavy responsibility upon himself when he makes song heard. For the elevation of the soul and its descent are dependent on music. It all depends on the musician, <strong>what he is playing and how he is playing it</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He doesn't just limit the musician: he also limits the song and even the instruments!</p>\n<p>Rav Nachman of Breslov succinctly remarks (Likutei Maharan 3:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold, when one hears music from a wicked musician, it becomes difficult for him to serve his Creator. Yet when he hears it from a kosher musician, then it is good for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Yaakov Moshe Hillel even cautions that not only the musician, song, and instruments be appropriate, but even the composer (Vayeshev Hayam 2:7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it is my humble opinion that <strong>any tune that was composed by a non-Jew or a Jewish sinner, even if it was not originally accompanied by lyrics - neither of promiscuity nor of idolatry - should not be listened to, and certainly should not be sung or played, for \"the force of the workman is in his works.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He proceeds to use this basis to reject the claims that a Jewish singer may take a non-Jewish song and adapt it, thus \"purifying\" it. However, songs originally non-Jewish that have crept into Jewish society should be permitted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding songs which stem from the songs of the [non-Jews] of decades and centuries ago, of which we do not know their lyrics nor their scheme, it is beyond the realm of our authority to forbid them. Even the issue of \"the effect of the workman is in his handiwork,\" which should be of concern, is also possibly a non-issue, since they have become sanctified by us over many years, and the memory of their corrupt, lustful source is all but forgotten; they no longer around and remind of those despicable things. It thus appears that there is no basis to forbid them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My comment: It seems important that he emphasizes the fact that their origins have been forgotten, as otherwise, the composer's spirit lives on and influences the listener.)</p>\n<p>It's for this reason that when Sha'ul's servants sought out a musician, they looked for one who had good character traits (Shmuel 1:16:18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And one of the youths called out and said, \"I have seen a son of Yishai from Beis Lechem who knows how to play music, is of great strength, of profound understanding, a man of stature, and HaShem is with him.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2>The lyrics</h2>\n<p>And we haven't even begun addressing the lyrics. Even when not part of a song, decadent speech is bad enough (Shabbos 33a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Due to the sin of obscenity of the mouth, many calamities and harsh decrees are renewed, young Jews die, orphans and widows cry out - and are not answered!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Combine it with music, and the results can be catastrophic (Reishis Chachmah, Sha'ar Ha'ahavah 10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Songs whose lyrics consist of desire and vulgarity cause the soul to become separated from being bound to eternal life. ... Indeed, some people of low worth are drawn after these low songs and destroy their souls.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishnah (Sanhedrin 10:1) lists one who reads \"outside books\" as one who loses his Olam Haba. What are these outside books? The Bartenura explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Included in this category is one who reads...songs of lust and desire,</strong> for they contain neither wisdom nor benefit, and are nothing more than a waste of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Presumably, he's referring to poetry, but the point still stands; adding a tune shouldn't detract from its danger.)</p>\n<p>With all of this background, it's no surprise that, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10762/9682\">Rabbi Gabriel</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/5809/9682\">Avraham</a> noted, Chazal banned music altogether after the Sanhedrin was disbanded (Sotah 48a). As the Yerushalmi explains (Sotah 45a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Said R' Chisda, \"At first, the fear of Sanhedrin was upon them, and they did not use words of vulgarity in their song. Now that the fear of Sanhedrin is no longer upon them, they do use vulgarity in their song.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(As an aside, this could explain Avraham's comment that today things are different. At least in Jewish music, vulgarity is no longer an issue, though non-Jewish music, for the most part, would seem to remain under this ban.)</p>\n<p>For one last point, Rav Zilberstein (Barchi Nafshi, Shemos p. 422-423, and Torascha Sha'ashu'ai, p. 212-213) records the following story:</p>\n<p>There was once a bachur who attended Beis Midrash Gevo'ah in Lakewood, who suddenly was overcome with a desire to convert to Christianity. Try as they might, nobody could dissuade him, including the Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Aharon Kotler.</p>\n<p>Rav Aharon enlisted the help of the Kopishnitzer Rebbe, who asked Rav Aharon to verify how the bachur set his alarm clock. Turns out, the most accurate clock he could find was the Church clock across the street from his dorm room that rings every hour on the hour, and so he had set his clocks according to the Church bell.</p>\n<p>Solution: The Rosh Yeshivah bought the bachur a new alarm clock that he personally set based on the Yeshiva clocks, and the Talmid remained in Yeshiva with an urge only to stay with Yiddishkeit, not to stray from it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Poskim</h2>\n<p>R' Moshe (EH 1:96) ultimately paskens that listening to music played by a rasha is not an issue of perpetuating the name of the wicked. However, depending on the type of wickedness, a ben Torah should avoid listening to it nonetheless, even if it's technically mutar.</p>\n<p>Yabi'a Omer 6 (OC 7) permits songs with impure sources, <em>provides that the words are switched.</em> Contrast to Vayeshev HaYam, quoted earlier.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Stern (Be'er Moshe 6:74), as well as Rav Menashe Klein (Mishnah Halachos 6:108) are much stricter, and hold that listening to music by a Rasha is even worse than using his Seder Torah!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Music can be an incredible boost to your neshamah, but it can also be an incredible detriment. Be careful how you use it, even if you hold it's permissible.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As I said, this post merely adapts the chapter and its main points. Other sources brought down are Rav Ahrele Roth, Shomer Emunim, Ma'amar Tzahali V'roni 6; Rav Avraham Schrorr, Halelach Vehalibuv 5761, Shemini 2; R' Yisrael Elya Weintraub (quoted but unsourced), Kuzari 2:64-65.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>if I remember correctly, first of all music in general is forbidden because we are mourning for the bet a micdash.\nbut we are lenient on music that are basically pesukim or praises to hahsem, specially in wedding and such.</p>\n\n<p>maran in shulhan aruch posek and I think in ialcut iosef he simply says that today is different</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should one induce vomiting upon realizing s/he just ate non-kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard several stories of people who ate something, realized it was non-kosher, and therefore induced vomiting. Is this halachically required? Recommended? Does it accomplish anything? (If not, how should it be viewed?)</p>\n\n<p>If I recall correctly there was a speaker from ... I think the OK; he said there's a story circulating that R' Moshe Feinstein vomited upon realizing he'd eaten non-chalav yisrael milk. The speaker then said that this story is 100% FALSE.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>I don't have sources, but logically:</p>\n\n<p>On a purely halachic level, the prohibition is \"eating\" and your eating is done.  It is a m'uvas lo yuchal liskon (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3101.htm#15\">Kohelet 1:15</a>).</p>\n\n<p>One can argue that as long as the treif is in the system, there remains a kabbalistic issue of timtum halev, that the treif spiritually affects the body.  However, this is not clear since the forbidden act is over, perhaps whatever effects the treif would have are in the proverbial rear-view mirror.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in a case of self induced vomiting, one must balance the non-halachic issues with Kavod haAdam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A major condition in food being non-kosher is its flavor. If it is dry as a bone and cannot impart any flavor it cannot be non-kosher (YD 99 Taz 1 et al). If it is revolting or tastes bad or even just gives a bad flavor to the mixture it is added to (even though by itself it tasted good), it is similarly kosher (<a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/03/additives-of-unpleasant-flavors-yd-103.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 103</a>). These and other rulings suggest that the primary factor of the prohibition against the consumption of non-kosher items is not the fact that it physically passes through the person's mouth and digestive tract, but rather the taste one feels while it does so. Once the taste is gone, the food in the person's stomach is of no Halachic relevance. In fact, on the contrary, if one were to cut open the person's stomach and remove whatever non-kosher food was left, it would surely be permitted for consumption at that point (ignoring for a moment a possibly applicable prohibition against <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16437/759\">doing disgusting things</a>), because of how revolting it is.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore IMO it does not make sense to induce vomiting after consuming non-kosher food, because right now the food in the person's system is not there in violation of any prohibition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Kanievsky(Doleh Umaskeh pg.258) was asked if one ate dairy during 6 hours of meat consumption should they throw it up . He answered that one does not have to throw up. Footnote 18 mentions that even if a person ate issur mamash like it says in Shailos Rav pg.25 that even if one ate a sheretz still they do not have to throw up. Rav Chaim (Derech Sicha pg.345) holds that throwing up will not save one from timtum halev,since it's the eating that causes timtum not the digestion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Double portion for firstborn\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I need to designate beneficiaries for a life insurance plan. I've designated my wife as the primary beneficiary and my children as contingent beneficiaries. My son is a firstborn and he has two sisters. Currently I have the distribution as a) son 50%; b) daughter 1 25%; c) daughter 2 50%.</p>\n\n<p>I made the distributions this way based on my knowledge of Jewish law?</p>\n\n<p>Then I found the following at <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06494.html\">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06494.html</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The firstborn takes a double portion\n  only of the present and not of the\n  contingent assets, i.e., only of the\n  assets in the father's possession at\n  the time of his death and not such as\n  were due to come into his possession\n  thereafter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would appear from this that Jewish law does not dictate how to handle a life insurance distribution, since it would be a considered a contingent asset.</p>\n\n<p>Have I analyzed this situation correctly? I'm curious what others would do...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The default system (which, absent a will or any sentiments otherwise, halacha would apply upon the death of the father) is that daughters are supported from the estate until they are married. If there are funds beyond that available, they are divided among the sons. If there are X sons and none are the firstborn, the division is 1/X for each. If one son is firstborn, he receives 2/(X+1) and the others receive 1/(X+1).  If there are only daughters, it's divided evenly between them.</p>\n\n<p>So in your case, the son would receive all, however he would be obligated to support your daughters until they marry.</p>\n\n<p>It appears (and this is just me talking, the above is the halacha whether what I say now is good or bad, and I can't claim this is <em>the</em> reason for the Torah's setup) that culturally, it was seen as giving women maximum privacy if they would be supported and not have to venture into business. Similarly, often the firstborn would be responsible for taking charge of the father's business, hence the double portion. The Talmud even says if the oldest son is working and supporting his younger brothers, he can deduct a suit from the shared funds as a business expense, \"so that his words may be heard.\"</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, one has every right to designate other divisions, with the late Rabbi Moshe Feinstein of the opinion that completing a secular will is halachically effective in and of itself. </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that for easily the past hundred years (and I believe longer), the standard Ashkenazic practice has become to divide funds evenly between all children, regardless of gender or birth order. Most parents would hate to find that their last will and testament tore their children asunder, and this solution is least likely to do so.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>j, whether your life insurance benefit is subject to the laws of inheritance depends on how your insurance is set up.  If you have a simple term policy, the benefit would not be considered your money since you have no rights to it unless you die while you are still making payments.  In other words, because \"you\" died,the insurance company will pay their own money to your beneficiaries.  (However, it is considered part of your legal estate if you have an incident of ownership.)  If you have a policy that contains an investment element (universal, whole life), that portion that you have rights to would be yours and subject to the laws of inheritance.  See Shalom above.</p>\n\n<p>There is a book-which I forgot the name, but I will find it and send you a comment-that circumvents the gender issues mentioned by Shalom by creating a huge monetary obligation to a 3rd party if the males do not abide by the wishes of the testator (creditors get paid before distribution of the estate).</p>\n\n\n",

She realized, then, that such a place is not suitable for a miracle to take place. So she was going to have to get Achashverosh someplace where none of these would be present in order to be successful in her mission; the one place in the palace where that would be the case would be in her own private apartments. So she invited Achashverosh there for a party, and (for reasons listed in the Gemara there) had to invite Haman too.</p>\n\n<p>The problem was that Haman came wearing his favorite outfit, the one on which he had embroidered a design of an idol (Esther Rabbah 7:5).

Naturally, he didn't want his \"god\" having to witness his humiliation! So he wore a different outfit. Now Esther seized her chance: almost as soon as he got home, covered in filth and thoroughly discouraged, \"the king's attendants arrived and made him hurry to Esther's party\" (6:14) — that was at her instigation, so that he wouldn't have time to change into the outfit with the embroidered images.

Apparently the battle with Amalek could only be won after a day's delay <em>(R Meir Armah, Yalkut Shimoni, Menos HaLevi, R Shmuel di Uzidah)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Esther knew Hashem does not let anyone suffer more than three days</strong>.

The first banquet had been an ice-breaker but hadn't accomplished everything she wanted. Haman had warmed to her a little, but he was still a dangerous enemy, who could turn on her in a moment and convince the king to kill her. He had not yet let his guard down fully so that he would be vulnerable to her attack. She needed to shock him to his very core <em>(Targum Sheni)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Esther was concerned that Achashverosh would prosecute her</strong> for breaking the law [by entering to see him without permission]. She wanted to allow more time to elapse and distance herself from the incident <em>(Akeidah)</em></li>\n<li>Haman did not yet feel fully equal to Achashverosh at the banquet, and therefore, <strong>Achashverosh's jealousy was not sufficiently aroused</strong>. The first banquet had been in honor of Achashverosh, with Haman attending in a subordinate role. The second would be given in honor of both Achashverosh and Haman equally, swelling Haman's head and discomfiting Achashverosh <em>(R Yosef ibn Yachia, Midrash Lekach Tov, Yosef Lekach, Yedei Moshe, Menos HaLevi)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Because Esther was fasting at the first banquet</strong>, she had not been able to join in the spirit of revelry, but at the second she would eat and drink with them.

    "content": "# Non-Lubavitch views of the Maggid of Mezrich's relationship with R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I know, all chasiduses agree that the Maggid of Mezrich was the primary student of the Baal Shem Tov.  But I was listening to an online shiur about Chabad (Lubavitch) history, which conveyed the unmistakable message that the primary student of the Maggid  was R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi, known to Chabad chasidim as the Alter Rebbe.  According to this shiur, not only was he the primary student, but the relationship between the Maggid and the Alter Rebbe was of a much higher level than any other student.</p>\n\n<p>If I were a follower of another chasidus, wouldn't I feel uncomfortable with this view?</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if perhaps this is similar to (l'havdil) the situation where the Torah says Yitzchak is the favored son of Avraham, whereas the Koran says that it's Yishmael; do other chasiduses claim that another student was the Maggid's primary student?  Or perhaps other chasiduses also trace their \"chasidic mesorah\" through the Alter Rebbe but it splits off at a later point?</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, <strong>what is the point of view of other chasiduses</strong> regarding this \"chain of mesorah\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>We do see that the Maggid entrusted R' Shneur Zalman with certain special tasks, such as the writing of an \"updated\" Shulchan Aruch, and the design of letterforms for STaM that would satisfy both the halachic (Beis Yosef) and kabbalistic (Arizal) opinions. The Maggid also gave him the title of \"our Rav.\" As far as I know, these facts are not in dispute, not even by secular historians such as Dubnow (who may indeed be looking only at superficial facts such as ages in considering who's a \"primary student\").</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, that doesn't invalidate the other branches of Chassidus and their connection to the Maggid (or to the Baal Shem Tov); G-d forbid that we compare any of them to Yishmael! Rather we might compare this to the different sons of Yaakov, all of who were tzaddikim and each of who contributes something unique to the Jewish People - yet Yosef was the favored son (and indeed, according to Kabbalah, is something of a \"bridge\" between the Avos and the rest of us).</p>\n\n<p>It's also worth pointing out that at the beginning, R' Shneur Zalman most certainly didn't view himself as the successor of the Maggid. At first he was a chassid of R' Avraham HaMalach (the Maggid's son), then, after the latter's passing, of R' Mendel Horodoker (Vitebsker), who I believe was the Maggid's oldest disciple; he also considered other elder students, such as R' Yissachar the Maggid of Lubavitch, as his mentors (indeed, R' Yissachar had been his own teacher for a few years, back before R' Shneur Zalman had even been introduced to Chassidus). It was only later on that he consented to accept any kind of leading position (primarily after R' Mendel's passing in 1788).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>From a letter of the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Rebbe Rayatz, published in HaTamim, a publication for the students in Yeshivat Tomchei Temimim, and <a href=\"http://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2347876/jewish/Third-Generation.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">translated into English in a book called \"Branches of the Chassidic Menorah\"</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For this purpose, they decided to appoint an Executive Committee and a General Coordinator.

He was empowered to set the general agenda for the work of the various centers, and for the campaign throughout the country. From time to time, he was also to visit the places where the Maggid's disciples lived.</p>\n<p>For about three years - from 5533 to 5536 [1773-76] - the Alter Rebbe was busy traveling to various places to investigate the condition of the Maggid's disciples, and the work they were doing in the various centers, to insure that it followed the agenda set by the Executive Committee.

I don't know any shul that has an attached parsonage. Thus most if not all of our shuls are exempt.</p>\n\n<p>Some may put up a mezuzah anyway either as a educational tool to teach and remind people about the mitzva of mezuzah, because some congregants may feel uncomfortable about a Jewish building not having a mezuzah, or possibly because they can raise money by allowing someone to donate the mezuzah!</p>\n\n<p>I imagine it's likely the first one. Certainly no bracha should be said upon affixing it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, some may consider our shuls nowadays to have the status of Batei Midrash (because people often learn in them and shiurim are given in them) which the Shulchan Aruch YD 286:10 says are obligated out of doubt in mezuzah. This now seems to me like the most likely explanation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Similar to Gershon:</p>\n\n<p>I always heard that a Beis Hakenesses (בית הכנסת) doesn't need one while a Beis Hamedrash (בית מדרש) does. \"Shul\" is a somewhat vague term, but in most instances it refers to a Beis Medrash. This is especially emphasized by the fact that we have no problems eating (think \"Kiddush\") in Shul.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, it so happens to be that my Shul does not have a Mezuzah, because it is in fact a Beis Hakenesses. We also only have a \"Kiddush\" in a side room specifically designed for such purposes...</p>\n\n<p>Then again, I may be completely wrong with all of the above.

Rather a woman who is home alone and has no one to make Havdalah for her, should recite it herself (Mishnah Berurah 296:35 - Aruch HaShulchan 296:5) rather than listen to it over the telephone. Even if the lady can not drink wine, grape juice, or beer, it is better for her to recite Havdalah over coffee (Shmiras Shabbos K'hilchasah 60 note 18) tea or milk alone (Aruch ha-Shulchan 272:14; Igros Moshe O.C. 2:75). According to some poskim (Tzitz Eliezer 8:16; Shemiras Shabbos K'hilchasah 60:5), it is preferable to drink grapefruit, orange or apple juice rather than to listen to Havdalah recited over the phone.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in a situation where you cannot recite Havdalah (in a hospital), and there is no one who can come until Tuesday evening (Orach Chaim 291.6) to make Havdalah for him, he may have to rely on the poskim who permit listening over the telephone(Igros Moshe O.C. 4:91-4; Tzitz Eliezer 8:11). But in a situation where someone could come and recite Havdalah for him before Tuesday evening, the correct procedure is to wait until then for Havdalah to be recited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It should be no different than any other halachah where you have to hear something. You can't be yotzei by hearing shofar, or megillah, or the like over the phone (will have to find the source for this), because you're not hearing the original sound but a re-creation of it from electrical signals; the same presumably applies to havdalah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe wrote (with regards to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15998&st=&pgnum=503\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megilla, Shofar</a>, and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16027&st=&pgnum=363\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gittin</a>) that in contrast to an acoustic hearing aide whose amplified sound is connected to the original sound, a sound produced through a microphone (or telephone) has no halachic connection to the original sound.</p>\n\n<p>A microphone (or telephone) works by a voice changing the electric current which produces a sound at the other end. Halachicaly, this would be just like computer-generated words, which one could not be yotzei with. The Rebbe pointed out that many of the poskim who ruled otherwise were misinformed as to the inherent nature of electricity.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rosh states that based on this Gemara a person may make Kiddush for his family members even if he made it previously. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are two components of Havdalah. The first is the Havdalah we say during prayer, and the second is Havdalah over a cup of wine.</p>\n<p>There are two opinions as to the source of saying Havdalah during prayer. One opinion is that Havdalah is from the Torah (Zachor es yom hashabas lekadsho, Remember the Shabbos to keep it holy, which one must do when shabbos comes in and goes out). A second opinion is that Havdalah is a Rabbinic enactment, and the verse \"Zachor es yom hashabas lekadsho\" is only for Kiddush.</p>\n<p>According to the opinion that the Havdalah we say during prayer is obligatory by Torah law, Havdalah over wine is a Rabbinic enactment connected to the Havdalah during prayer. Therefore, all who are obligated in Havdalah during prayer (men and women) must say Havdalah over wine.</p>\n<p>According to the opinion that the Havdalah during prayer is Rabbinic, there are two reasons given for Havdalah over wine. Some say it's an independent decree to differentiate between the holy and the secular, and not connected to Zachor at all. Therefore, women have no obligation to say Havdalah over wine. Others say the decree is an extension of Zachor, which means women would be obligated in Havdalah over wine.</p>\n<p>So, once a man did Havdalah, he should not do it for women because according to the second opinion, women are not obligated, and if there is a doubt over whether to say blessings or not, one doesn't. Women can make Havdalah for themselves, however, like they can make a blessing over any commandment in which they aren't obligated.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16043&st=&pgnum=164\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav 296:19</a></p>\n\n\n",

I know that both are brought up in the literature, even co-occurring in רש\"י's comment on the birth and naming of יהודה. Does anyone explicitly contrast the two concepts of gratitude?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Frand addresses the definition of each of these words in a different Dvar Torah.  </p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5769/shoftim.html#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parshat Shoftim</a> he addresses the meaning of the words HaKaras HaTov which is generally translated as gratitude.  He explains why they Talmud tells so many stories about Amoraim recusing themselves as viable judges just because they had received a favor from one of the litigants.  \"The major lesson that this passage of Talmud teaches is the concept of Hakaras HaTov [gratitude]. This Gemara teaches us how indebted each of these Amoraim felt to anyone who did them even the slightest favor.\"   He seems to be indicating here that HaKaras HaTov is the indebtedness we feel and should show towards another.  He explains that even acts that we have come to expect from another, like a spouse or an employee, should still induce a feeling of HaKaras HaTov.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5756/tzav.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parshat Tzav</a> he addresses the meaning of Hoda'ah defining the word as both 'thanks' and 'admitting', giving credit for these definitions to Rav Hutner. We must admit we needed someone before we can thank them.</p>\n\n<p>So if we take both his meanings and put them together it appears that we should have HaKaras HaTov toward everyone who helps us and serves us, whether we needed it or not and Hoda'ah is thanking someone for something we could not have done on our own.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hakaras haTov, although in a simple sense is an awareness like Yahu said, is a responsibility that manifests itself in an action or inaction, though not necessarily of hodaah.</p>\n\n<p>An example off the top of my head is the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9617&st=&pgnum=292\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramban</a> on why Ammon was kicked out of the Kahal more than other nations who didn't take nourishment to the Bnei Yisrael.  He answers that since Lot was saved by Avraham, Ammon had a responsibility to do good to the B'nei Yisrael, and they did the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing nourishment is not \"hodaah\", any nation would have done so, and they did (Edom as well as Moav).  But Hakaras haTov creates a higher responsibility of reciprocity toward those who benefited you.  What actions or inactions will one take in recognition of being a beneficiary?</p>\n\n<p>Hodaah is a verbal or physical acknowlegement of the benifit (like saying thank you).  You can give hodaah to someone with good intentions even if you didn't actually have a benefit.  In that case, you don't have a responsibility toward the benefactor, but you can be grateful for his intentions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I noticed that there are two types of <em>middos</em> — intransitive and transitive. I mean those terms in the grammatical sense: Intransitive <em>middos</em> have no object, no specific target. Sadness is what I would call an intransitive <em>middah</em>, as it’s a state of mind rather than part of a relationship with another. Transitive ones express an attitude toward an object. Something close to a transitive version of sadness is disappointment; we don’t get sad at someone, but we can be disappointed in them. Admittedly the line gets blurry when one discusses a transitive <em>middah</em> but it’s about the relationship between me and myself. Is frustration with oneself really transitive? But we do feel a subtle difference when frustrated with ourselves and frustrated with “the universe”, with no specific target.</p>\n\n<p>A second distinction I would like to draw before plunging into the topic of gratitude is that between perceptions and responses. We do not respond to the world, we respond to how we perceive the world. Like <a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.coolopticalillusions.com/illusions/youngladyoldlady.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the famous picture that looks either like a beautiful young woman or her cronish mother</a>, we choose how we see the world.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of gratitude, there is certainly both an element of perception and of response.</p>\n\n<p>The perception, in turn, also has two elements: Intransitive and transitive. In this section, I want to look at these two elements of the perception of gratitude.</p>\n\n<p>I can feel grateful for having this apple. I have <em>hakaras hatov</em>, literally, a recognition of the good that is before me. I am happy because I have something to enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I can turn it into a transitive feeling, going beyond being grateful for what I have, to look at who I am receiving from. I make a <em>berakhah</em>, I thank the One Who made this apple possible.</p>\n\n<p>Within the <em>hakaras hatov</em> aspect of the perception, looking at what good we have in our lives, we can be aware of the same good thing in more or less detail. We can be grateful for the apple. Or, we can be grateful that Hashem made it possible for people to plant the tree, sell it to the wholesaler, provide the means for an open market in apples, all the many elements that go into my wife finding it in a store display, her loving me and wanting me to have something to enjoy and eat healthier, and her buying it for me. Notice how, by spelling out the detail, one realizes more fully the greatness of the tov. The closer we look, the larger it looms.</p>\n\n<p>This is a primary lesson in <em>meseches</em> Berakhos. The gemara has discussions for dozens of pages over which <em>berakhah</em> to make on what food. Why? Does our thanks for a banana really depend on whether we thank Hashem calling it the fruit of a tree, or whether we recognize that a banana “tree” is a perennial, and therefore we should thank Him for “the fruit of the ground”? I think that’s just the point — the attention to detail is critical. Without it, one can not fully recognize the good Hashem does for us.</p>\n\n<p>Along with recognizing the full extent of the good we receive is acknowledging that there is a provider.</p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question (finally):</p>\n\n<p><em>Hakaras haTov</em> is \"recognition of the good\" -- it's an intransitive perception. \"It is good to be alive!\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Hoda'ah</em> is \"thankfulness\" -- a transitive response. \"Thank you G-d for giving me another day.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of the things cancer taught me (<em>BH</em> and <em>ba\"h</em> now 14 years in remission) was that there are two messages to waking up saying \"<em>Modeh Ani</em>\":</p>\n\n<p>The explicit one -- thank G-d I woke up! (<em>Hoda'ah</em>)</p>\n\n<p>The implicit one -- even \"just\" waking up is something huge (<em>hakaras hatov</em>). Which then gets me to the <em>hoda'ah</em>; it is worth thanking Hashem for.</p>\n\n<p>(Source: translation of the words.)</p>\n\n\n",

(He considers this less objectionable than shituf.) This opinion actually has halachic implications too: once the Jews demonstrated that idolatry was acceptable to them, then the Canaanites living in the Land of Israel could be considered their agents, and their worship of things such as asheirah-trees would indeed make them forbidden for use, even though they were already part of the Jews' patrimony (Avodah Zarah 53b).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Because <em>Elohecha</em> is plural. <em>Elohim</em> + <em>shelcha</em> = <em>Elohecha</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

According to both the Rambam and the Avudraham everybody fasted.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe answers that like the Avudraham, everybody should have fasted on the 13th of Adar. However, they were not allowed to do so since fasting would have made them weak and prevented them from defending themselves properly. Instead they accepted upon themselves to fast at a different time (as brought in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&pgnum=95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orech Chaim 571:3</a>). This left only Esther, who was safe in the palace, free to fast, since she didn't have to defend herself.</p>\n\n<p>So, according to the Rebbe, this is why it is called Ta'anis Esther, since only Esther fasted on the 13th of Adar.</p>\n\n<p>See all the details and sources <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/timeless-patterns/26.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Some say the Jews fasted the day they fought, or the day before it. (So on Purim, more or less.)</p>\n\n<p>Some say that the holiday commemorates \"divrei hatzomos v'zaakasam\", <em>the matter of their fasts and cries</em>; so we fast the day before Purim to commemorate that in the Purim story, Esther and the Jewish people all fasted and prayed before she approached the king. (Even though the actual fasting in the Purim story happened not in the Hebrew month of Adar in which Purim is celebrated, but 11 months earlier, in Nisan of the previous year).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the Raavad in Sefer HaEshkol says the fast has nothing to do with any of this. It's that if people could eat the day before Purim, they might drink too, and once they're <em>drinking</em> ... well .. as Rabbi Hershel Welcher put it, \"We want people to show up to Megillah reading, able to stand up on two feet!\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The widespread reason given why we fast on ערב פורים is to commemorate the fasts mentioned in the מגילה which אסתר requested the Jews to observe before she went to the king. However, the Abudraham (סדר תפלות תעניות ופי׳, ועיין לקו״ש ח״ו עמ׳ 371‏) states several difficulties with this explanation. Firstly, אסתר went to אחשורוש on the first night of פסח, not on ערב פורים. Additionally, those fasts lasted for three days and nights. </p>\n\n<p>Other explanations have been offered to explain why we fast. The Levush (סימן תרפו) explains that on the 13th of Adar the Jews gathered to defend themselves against their enemies, and they would have had to pray for compassion. Probably they fasted on that day; just as we find in the מדרש that משה רבינו fasted during the war against עמלק. Since we commemorate the miracle that occurred on פורים we act like them by emulating their fasting and prayers. The Lubavitcher Rebbe adds (לקו״ש ח״ו עמ׳ 371‏) that this explains why the fast is named תענית אסתר, for anyone who needed to fight to defend themself (which includes all Jews young and old, male and female) was Halachicly prohibited from fasting (שו״ע או״ח סו״ס תקע״א) in order not to diminish their strength, so the only person who ended up actually fasting was אסתר.</p>\n\n<p>The בית יוסף was known to have a חברותא with a מלאך. Once, while they were learning together the מלאך revealed a fascinating reason for תענית אסתר. On פורים we are exceedingly happy and we feast and celebrate in a way of \"עד דלא ידע\". In order to preemptively avert any undesirable behavior that may come as a result of the festivities, we fast the day beforehand (מגיד משרים פ' ויקהל ד״ה אור, הו״ד בס׳ \"קב הישר\" פרק צז).</p>\n\n<p>Another answer is brought in the name of the early Kabbalists (שו״ת שבט הקהתי ח״א סי׳ רג). Although the decree of המן was not carried out, it was not completely abolished, and remnants of the decree are fulfilled in the subsequent calamities that have occurred to the Jewish people. [This is hinted to in the מגילה in which the word \"חור\" is written with a large ח׳ and the word \"ותכתוב\" has a large ת׳, alluding the atrocious pogroms of Chelminsky which began in the year ת״ח‎ (5408 - 1648)].  חז״ל therefore established a fast day every year, in order for us to pray to annul this ongoing evil decree of המן.</p>\n\n\n",

The topic of the lecture was \"The Jewish Diaspora in Modern China\". Professor Xin covered the brief but nonetheless important role of some Jewish communities in China, and how they fit in with some of broader Jewish and Chinese history.</p>\n\n<p>During the questions portion of the lecture someone asked Professor Xin why the Japanese, allies of the Nazis tolerated Jewish emigration from Europe to China during WW2 if the Japanese knew of the Nazi's plans with the Jews? Professor Xin offered an anecdote about how the Japanese, who were not fully understanding of the Nazi animosity towards Jews, gathered some prominent Jews that were in the area and asked them why the Nazis hated them so much. The Jews told the japanese \"it's because we are Asian\". That got a laugh from the crowd, since Professor Xin had framed the lecture earlier by mentioning that Israel could geographically be considered part of Asia.</p>\n\n<p>(I am not sure if the humor comes across well in writing so I will explain it:) The joke was that the Jews understood that the Japanese, the ones asking them the question, were Asian. So by linking the Jews to Asia they would be suggesting that perhaps the Nazis might have it out for the Japanese as well, and as a result the Japanese would not be so keen on helping the Nazis.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: is there a reliable primary or secondary source for this anecdote?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Could someone please help me give this question appropriate tags</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I can't vouch for the reliability of this source, but the story is found in Warren Kozak, <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060511028\"><em>The Rabbi of 84th Street: The Extraordinary Life of Haskel Besser</em></a> (HarperCollins, 2004), pp. 176-7 (cited in the Wikipedia article on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Ghetto\">Shanghai Ghetto</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the Germans pressed the Japanese\n  to turn over the entire Jewish\n  community [in Shanghai], the Japanese\n  military governor sent for its\n  leaders. Fearing the worst, the\n  community sent a small delegation\n  including the Amshinover Rebbe, Shimon\n  [Shalom] Kalish, along with someone\n  who could translate through English...</p>\n  \n  <p>The Japanese governor was curious. He\n  did not understand why these Jews were\n  singled out from all other\n  Europeans... Finally the governor\n  broke his silence, speaking in\n  Japanese with a quick, terse question,\n  which was translated by one of his\n  lieutenants into English. The\n  English-Yiddish interpreter then\n  translated it into Yiddish. \"Farvoos\n  hoben di Daitschen aich azoy feint -\n  Why do the Germans hate you so much?\"\n  Without hesitation and knowing the\n  fate of his community hung on his\n  answer, Reb Kalish told the\n  translator, \"Zugim weil mir senen\n  orientalim - Tell him the Germans hate\n  us because we are Oriental.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Japanese governor, whose face had\n  been stern throughout the\n  confrontation, broke into a slight\n  smile. In spite of the military\n  alliance, he did not accede to the\n  German demand and the Shanghai Jews\n  were never handed over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's more to it than this, though. The Japanese had warm feelings towards Jews going back to the Russo-Japanese War, when the Jewish financier Jacob Schiff lent them a large sum of money (probably on the theory that \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" - the Russian czar, Nicholas II, was a terrible anti-Semite). That said, anti-Jewish propaganda did make some headway in Japan during WWII, and it took heroic efforts by people such as <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ho/p/48943041.html\">Setzuso Kotsuji</a> (later himself a ger tzedek) to ward off its effects.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've heard it as well; the version I heard is that a Japanese officer had called in one of the students who had fled with the Mir yeshiva from Mir, Eastern Europe, to Shanghai. \"Why do the Germans want us to ship you back?\" \"Because we're Asian.\"</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that part of the geopolitics involved Shanghai being an internationalized city as a result of the Opium Wars, which I think would have made it harder to make the Jews leave, but I don't know more details. Only that your anecdote certainly makes its way around.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the \"Fugu Plan\" (see wikipedia); apparently some in Japan believed the Nazi propaganda about the Jews controlling all the banks and the like, and they believed that if they took some precautions, they could put that economic/industrial power to work for them.</p>\n\n\n",

Would there be a Chiyuv of Maaser on this gain?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I'd think it might be analogous to \"performing kiddushin with a loan [that has already been given]\" - i.e., where Reuven, who has previously lent money to Rochel, tells her that he'd like to use that money for kiddushin. The halachah is that this is not effective, because he hasn't given her anything now; the money is already considered to belong to her from the moment she borrowed it (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40524&pgnum=131\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha-Ezer 28:7</a>, from Kiddushin 6b and Rashi there ד\"ה אינה מקודשת).

If I'm understanding Rashi (ד\"ה לא צריכא) correctly, this \"benefit\" equals the amount that you'd have to pay someone to arrange the deferral or cancellation of the loan. So I guess you could argue that in the case you're asking about, if one made the arrangements himself and didn't have to pay a credit-repair firm to do so, then he might indeed be obligated in maaser for that amount - but not for the full sum that the creditor has written off.</p>\n\n\n",

Did any other Sephardi communities join in this decision later on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>In 1935, the Beth Din of the Syrian community in Brooklyn promulgated a ban on accepting any converts. This ban was reaffirmed by their rabbinical authorities in 1946, 1972, 1984, and 2006. The initial ban was modeled off of a similar ban enacted by the Syrian community in Argentina.</p>\n<p>When their community first started to take root in the US many of their men began to date gentile women. This lead naturally of course to them wanting to marry these women. However given the strong social stigma and taboo associated with intermarriage (not to mention the halakhic issur) many of them preferred to encourage their romantic partners to convert to Judaism. This however is a halakhically dubious practice (see H. Issure Biah 13:14). A series of questionable conversions began to be performed, and insincere converts whose sole purpose for conversion was marriage was a growing concern. These sham conversions were a threat to the very fabric and longevity of the community.</p>\n<p>The ban or \"Edict\" as it is popularly known, is predicated upon the right of a local Beth-Din to enact taqanoth and prohibitions according to the needs of the time. H. Sanhedrin 24:4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש לבית דין להלקות מי שאינו מחוייב מלקות, ולהרוג מי שאינו מחוייב\nמיתה, לא לעבור על דברי תורה, אלא לעשות סייג לתורה.  וכיון שרואין בית\nדין שפרצו העם בדבר--יש להן לגדור ולחזק הדבר, כפי מה שייראה להם:  הכול\nהוראת שעה, לא שיקבע הלכה לדורות.</p>\n<p>A court has the authority to administer lashes to a person who is not\nrequired to receive lashes and to execute a person who is not liable\nto be executed. This license was not granted to overstep the words of\nthe Torah, but rather to create a fence around the words of the Torah.\nWhen the court sees that the people have broken the accepted norms\nwith regard to a matter, they may establish safeguards to strengthen\nthe matter according to what appears necessary to them. All the above\napplies with regard to establishing directives for the immediate time,\nand not with regard to the establishment of halakhah for all time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The intention of the Edict is not to oppress converts, it is to protect the community against the specter of assimilation. It is not intended to be a permanent feature of the community but rather is intended to curb a specific anti-Torah behavior that emerged in a specific socio-historic context. It is up to the Beth Din to re-assess the propriety of the Edict's renewal.</p>\n<p>From the outside one might question whether the same threat of assimilation and sham conversions is still a threat to the Syrian community. However it is up to the Beth Din, based on its intimate knowledge and specific to the needs of its own community, to determine its necessity.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge, no other communities have joined the Edict. However culturally within Brooklyn, the Syrian community does hold sway over other Sepharadi communities, such as the Lebanese and Egyptian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HxLRU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HxLRU.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N80Gc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N80Gc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wHXlv.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wHXlv.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to the Mahzor Aram Soba of\n  1527 and 1560, conversions were\n  normative, but rare, as there are\n  blessings in the Mahzor on the rituals\n  of conversions.

If it were allowed even ערב פסח, people would err and eat it before the ביטול, which is dangerous, so a לא פלוג was instituted to cover the whole day.

I would appreciate as many answers as possibile</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Breishis 2:5 and Rashi says that the grass was ready to come out from the ground on the third day, however there was no rain since there was no man to realize the necessity of rain. On the sixth day Adam was created and he realized the value of rain. Only after he prayed for the rain, did it come down and make the plants grow.\nThis teaches us that even if something is ready in Heaven for a person if he doesn't see the need for it which would make him pray for it, then he may not get it.\nTefilah is something that is necessary for a person to obtain what he needs. Surely Hashem knows our needs without our asking, but this is His will and the way He deals with us. He wants us to realize what we need, that we cannot get them in any manner without Him, and to pray to Him for it. This is also for our benefit so that through this we can get closer to Hashem. Without Tefilah everything is frozen in place even though it is all finished and ready for the person.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Chazkel Levenstein zt\"l, in the Sefer Sichos Elul pg 64-68 writes about another aspect of Tefilah. Rav Chazkel points out how we are in a society that constantly preaches \"Kochi V'otzem Yadi\", (everything we attain is through Our might and Our great intelligence and not through Hashem). This influences us very much. Consequently, we need constant reminders that Hashem runs the world. That is what Tefillah and Brachos on food teach us. They are reminders of Emunah and Hashgacha. We constantly repeat, \"You give us Knowledge..., You Heal us...,\". Sh'hakol nihyah bi'dvaro - to believe in simplicity that \"all is made only through His words\". He concludes, \"... likewise all prayer, has one goal, to ingrain the following principle in a person's heart \"A person doesn't support himself in any way, all he needs is help from Hashem\".\" \nThis will help us counter the constant barrage of \"Kochi V'otzem Yadi\" that we are submerged in.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of Tefillah is the fact that it is very therapeutic and helps to calm a person's fears. A person has many problems and things to worry about. Some people even have to go to a psychiatrist and spend a lot of money, but it doesn't always help. We, however, only have to go to Hashem, and we don't need any money or appointments. Knowing that you are talking to the One Who is in charge of everything gives us a tremendous peace of mind. </p>\n\n<p>A common question about Tefilah is, \"Why do we have to Daven so many times, why not once a year\"? This is similar to the question that the Talmidim of Rav Shimeon bar Yochai asked him. (Yoma 76a) \"Why did the manna come down every day why not once a year\"? He answered them with a parable. A King gave his son his yearly allowance in one lump sum at the beginning of the year. This resulted in the prince seeing the King only once a year. The King wished to see his son more often, so he decided to give him a daily allowance, forcing the prince to come by everyday. Likewise with the manna. Bnei Yisroel would worry every day that perhaps there would be no manna on the following day and they would die. This forced them to turn there hearts to Hashem everyday.\" That is why Hashem gives us the privilege of davening to him every day three times. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I was thinking about this today while putting on tfilin, and I think I understood something.

For example, the wider angle of a triangle is opposite the longer side; a quadrilateral with parallel opposite sides has equal opposite sides; etc. (The only misstatement AFAICT in that chapter, in #25, is that if an angle and two sides of one triangle equal an angle and two sides of another triangle, then the remaining angles and side of the triangles are also equal.) This is a reasonable basic-high-school-geometry text, I suppose, but not the way high school geometry is taught nowadays (where a lot of attention is paid to the difference between postulates and theorems, and to proofs). It may also be of some interest to students of the history of mathematics (I don't know), but not to mathematicians.</p>\n\n<p>I'll <em>bl\"n</em> get to the remaining chapters (and perhaps the introductions) at a later date.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A later date:</p>\n\n<p>I've now read chapter 2. Most of it deals with proportions. He discusses how if you add the first to the second term in a proportion, and add the third to the fourth, the result is still a valid proportion, and other such manipulations: rather more manipulations than I would have expected (he adds the first to the second, subtracts it, adds the second to the first, subtracts it, etc., etc.), but nothing that's not covered — though some of them as exercises — in a prealgebra class (or so). The last two paragraphs are on another topic: they state, first, that if you do the same thing to both sides of an equation then the result is still a valid equation, and, second, that if <i>a</i>=<i>b</i> and <i>b</i>=<i>c</i> then <i>a</i>=<i>c</i>. Again, this is covered in prealgebra (or so). Nothing of interest to mathematicians here.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>An even later date:</p>\n\n<p>I've now read chapter 3. It deals with several topics, all of which seem to be therein order to build up to its two main results, the formula for the area of a circle and the Pythagorean theorem. Along the way he mentions and proves various results from high-school geometry, including that a triangle with two (or three) equal sides (or angles) has two (or three) equal angles (or sides), that corresponding angles formed by two parallel lines with a common transversal are equal, that the area of a triangle is half the base times the altitude, and the like. His two proofs of the Pythagorean theorem are standard, including Euclid's. He proves also that the circumference of a circle is more than three times its diameter, using a proof I haven't seen before, personally, but strongly suspect is well known. Finally, he proves that the area of a circle is half its circumference times its radius, using a method of proof that is by far not rigorous enough for a modern mathematician, but which approximates a standard proof from calculus: take concentric infinitesimal shells and sum their infinitesimal area. Again, there is nothing here that won't be found in many other places (except perhaps his proof that the circumference of a circle is more than three times its diameter, but, again, I doubt it).</p>\n\n<p>Also, re question 5: In the first three chapters, there's no Torah content.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20713&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20713&st=&pgnum=4</a></p>\n\n<p>this link shows the Haskamos on the Sefer איל משולש.

He did not feel the same way about Islam, however, going so far as to condone praying within a mosque, and many Orthodox Jewish Rabbis take the same position on the subject, but with some adding a \"shittuf\" exception for gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>If Christians are idolaters and thus violate the Noahide laws against idolatry and the commandment to worship the one G-d, why has the Christian West come to dominate the entire world? Why was it Christians who explored and colonized the globe, went into space and then later to the moon, and not Muslims? It really does seem that G-d has favored and blessed the West and the United States in particular, which seems to be completely at odds with the designation of their faith as avodah zarah, when G-d could have just as easily elevated the Muslim world instead. Why would G-d prefer idolaters to non-idolaters?</p>\n\n<p>Second, why are Jews still living among Christians if they are idolaters and not with each other in Israel or, following the Rambam's lead, living among Muslims? Isn't it hypocritical to denounce the faith of the majority of those around you as idolatry when you could choose to live, as Maimonides did, in a Muslim country without those idolaters or without as many of them (particularly without them in positions of power)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>R' Chaim Dov Rabinowitz (author of Daas Sofrim), in his volume on Jewish history since the close of Tanach, in fact harshly criticizes the Jews of Babylonia for migrating from there to the Christian West during the Geonic era.

(Though there were some early authorities - I think R' Saadiah Gaon was one - who say that the Romans were the cultural inheritors of Greece and therefore count as part of that kingdom, while Islam is the \"fourth kingdom\" that will hold sway in the era before Moshiach's arrival.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Yes it seems funny; at the other extreme, anti-Semitism in India is considered virtually nonexistant historically, when Hinduism and Judaism have, shall I say, more or less mutually-exclusive theologies.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the answer seems to be that \"good fences make good neighbors\", or as one genealogist put it, \"you fight with your cousins.\" A religion that has nothing to do with Judaism whatsoever tends to mind its own business.

As you can see from the descriptions and the map at the bottom of the page, Jewish migration was often linked to economic potential and cultural advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore a variety of issues caused some people to emigrate to Rome, others to Greece, east to Babylonia, Europe or along the African and Asia Minor coasts.</p>\n\n<p>For the first six centuries, the Christians were not a major problem to Jews as the Christians were busy battling and converting (often by force) the pagan tribes of Europe.  Dimont, \"Jews, G-d and History, pp. 151-152.  Also Jews benefited because they were more educated and cultured than the newly-converted pagans were, and rose to relatively high positions.  Ibid. pp. 213.</p>\n\n<p>During the feudal era, Europe held some attraction to Jews because of the restrictions placed on Jews. Christians were tied to the land or if they were craftsmen, they were tied to their guilds and forbidden by law to lend money at interest.  Jews, however, were forbidden to own land or join the guilds.  But that meant they had nothing tying them down, and they alone could lend money with interest to non-Jews.  Carroll, \"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=FewzTELynqUC&pg=PA243&dq=Jews%20in%20the%20feudal%20system%20%22not%20tied%20to%20the%20land%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Zx0UUfD5BujV0gHl44D4Dw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Jews%20in%20the%20feudal%20system%20%22not%20tied%20to%20the%20land%22&f=false\">Constatine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History</a>,\" pp 243-44.  </p>\n\n<p>The conflict between Moslems and Christians, during the Crusades period, also benefited Jews who lived in or traveled to both worlds.  Welcome in both worlds, Jews were able to sell the goods of Moslems (and others through Asia) to the Christian nations, thereby pollinating Europe with many influences from the Orient. See Abrahams, \"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=cu_fnfmOHu4C&pg=PA214&dq=%22Jewish%20merchants%22%20in%20Middle%20Ages&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yh4UUZfoBpLq0QGck4CoDA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Jewish%20merchants%22%20in%20Middle%20Ages&f=false\">Jewish Life in the Middle Ages</a>,\" p. 214; Stillman, \"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&pg=PA498&dq=%22Jewish%20merchants%22%20and%20Muslims&hl=en&sa=X&ei=niEUUaXvI9OC0QGm5oCIDA&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Jewish%20merchants%22%20and%20Muslims&f=false\">Jewish Merchants</a>,\" contained in Meri and Bacharach, \"Medieval Islamic Civilization L-Z\" at pp 497-498. </p>\n\n<p>But with the success of Jewish merchants came a downside: \"When Feudal man realized the superiority of the Jewish way of doing things, he absorbed Jewish know-how, kicked the Jews out to eliminate the competition, and went into business for himself.\"  Dimont, at 224. Jews migrated instead to Eastern Europe where their special skills were welcomed. Ibid.</p>\n\n<p>Jews did well in the Islamic world, depending upon the rise and fall of various sects.  Jews during Rambam's early years were respected and protected in Andalusia during the reign of the Almoravids, but when they were deposed in 1148 by the Berbers, that sect forced Jews to convert to Islam if they chose to stay.  1954 Encyclopedia Americana, vol. 18, p. 140.<br>\nSimilarly, other Jewish communities in the Arab world suffered ups and downs depending on who was in charge.  </p>\n\n<p>But, as always, Jews outside of their homeland live where they are welcome, and leave where they are not.  Before World War II, 9.5 million Jews lived in Europe. <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005161\">Holocaust Encyclopedia</a>. But because of the Holocaust and continued anti-semitism in parts of Europe, only 1.45 million reside there, according to the <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html\">American Jewish Yearbook for 2010</a>.  The Arab-Israel conflict has caused a sharp downturn in the Jewish population in Moslem countries.  The Jewish population in the Middle East dropped from 1 million in <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/jew_refugees.html\">1948</a>, including Iran but excluding Israel, to less than 20,000 in <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html\">2010</a>. That decrease includes 867,000 Jews who were expelled, or forced out of Moslem countries at war with Israel.  \"The Forgotten Exodus,\" Jerusalem Post Special Supplement, Nov. 29, 2002, pp. 12-13.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize:  The fact that Christians are or are not idolators is not determinative of where Jews live.  They live where it is in their own interests.</p>\n\n\n",

This experience serves their ability to relate to, intuit about, and inform the individual needs of the asker. Could it be possible for a well-qualified <em>posek</em>, in possession of these qualities, to forgo them for a good reason? Or would that invalidate the individualized <em>p'sak</em>?</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the case (See linked answers.) where Rav Moshe is presented similar chickens by different women and decides differently for each of them based on his correct assessment of the facts, imagine that the woman whose chicken he allowed had come back in and declared \"Individual proclivities aside, what should I really do with this chicken? Whatever you say I will accept wholeheartedly and follow with no hesitation or resentment.\"? Clearly we would not say that the original <em>p'sak</em> was wrong because there is simply more information now than there was before. Is there an intellectually and spiritually honest way that a <em>sho'el</em> who would be given a certain answer based on personal sensitivities and the like could opt to ignore those sensitivities and instead get the complete, true, and valid - but general - answer that a general treatment of his <em>halacha</em> would yield?</p>\n\n<p>As a corollary, could a person <em>be a type of person</em> who always wanted and asked for the latter type of <em>p'sak</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet likes to quote Rabbi Yerucham Gorelik as saying that a posek has to be in a laboratory, completely isolated from the outside world ... Rabbi Rakeffet then cites others who strongly disagree. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Individual proclivities aside ... I will accept wholeheartedly and follow with no hesitation or resentment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hesitation or resentment has nothing to do with it. It's a case where (for instance) we believe one opinion in the <em>Rishonim</em> is correct as baseline law, yet we seek to also follow a second opinion where it won't cause hardship. If it will cause financial hardship to this person, then they should not follow it. It's easy to say \"oh it won't bother me\", but if they have to spend the money on another chicken today, then tomorrow they won't have money for something else important. If the <em>psak</em> is \"this instance should be allowed in cases of great need, and you have great need\", then that is what should be followed. If the <em>psak</em> was based on faulty information (the lady was pretending to be poor to evade taxes but had billions offshore) that would be one thing; but if Rav Moshe saw the facts and made a psak, that's solid; don't waste your money on being machmir.</p>\n\n<p>(I recognize the Gemara says that a Torah scholar on a high level should refrain from eating something that required a complex <em>psak</em>; we're talking about normal people here, once they've been given their psak.)</p>\n\n<p>A sad but very pertinent footnote: from what I read a few years ago, OCD tends to manifest itself in the Orthodox community at about the same rate as the general population, but the behaviors tend to focus on a small handful of things: <em>is this food <strong>really</strong> kosher?</em> ; <em>did I wash enough so I can pray now?</em> ; and <em>am I clean enough to dunk in the mikva now?</em>. One vital way to tell whether someone has OCD or is simply being <em>machmir</em> is if their rabbi told them that's enough -- if they follow the rabbi, fine; if not, it could very well be OCD. So it's important as a matter of policy to let people know that a psak should be followed. </p>\n\n<p>I don't recall which of the Achronim stated that if a small amount of non-kosher was nullified in a large mixture of kosher and a competent rabbi ruled it was okay, it's a <em>mitzva</em> to then eat that food (assuming it tastes good and you're hungry), to show we believe that the same Torah that said \"don't eat non-kosher\" also said \"small amounts can be nullified in some cases.\" </p>\n\n<p>Or as Rabbi Zev Leff told an older man who attempted to fast on Yom Kippur despite strong doctor's orders otherwise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The will of G-d is that you eat today and stay healthy; what you're doing is idol worship. Who cares if the idol is a statue called Baal, or if the idol is a thing called Yom Kippur? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It is based on the Kabbalah of their founder, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. While it is a legitimately inspiring source, it is considered too advanced for the newcomer to Jewish thought. It is also by no means accepted by all Jews who study Kabbalah.\nRabbi Aryeh Kaplan is in my opinion one of the greatest Rabbis of the 20th century. His books on Kabbalah are often fairly technical, however, and I would hesitate to recommend his work to the completely fresh newcomer.\nPerhaps it would be best to begin a study of Kabbalah by learning the tales that are told about the great Hasidic masters. These are published in various places in books and the internet. Martin Buber has translated and published many tales in his books. He is a decent source for this kind of material.\nThough this is not a direct approach to the heart of the subject matter, we are discussing an immensely complex tradition of meditation on G-d, and it would behoove the seeker to become familiar with the personalities and feelings associated with the world they wish to engage with.\nUltimately, there is no authentic Kabbalah, divorced from regular Jewish practice. This tradition of mysticism has developed in the context of the observance of Torah law and the rigorous study of Talmud. Without a firm grasp on these, there is no sense in approaching Kabbalah at all.

Rabbi Yaakov Emden (shut Yaavetz II:82) says a Golem lacks the intelligence (see article; is intelligence defined by speech, morality, or both) to be counted for a minyan. R' Gershom Hanokh Leiner, the Radzyner Rebbe, infers (Sidrei Taharos Ohalos 5a) that if a Golem passed some intelligence threshold, it would be considered human; if made by a Jew, it would be treated as a Jew and count for a minyan. (Now a Jew \"makes\" a Golem out of dust much more than he would \"make\" a robot out of parts, so that last part would be unclear.)</p>\n\n<p>But that should get you started. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>So long as the robot is not Mechuyav in Mitzvos you would be unable to use him for a Minyan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A Golem has a sort of soul and is powered by spirituality. A robot is powered by physical means. Telling the robot to do an action on Shabbat would require sensors for it to process your request and motors to do it. This would involve electricity or some other forbidden process.</p>\n<p>A Golem uses spiritual magic, not electricity and you could ask it to do a non-melacha action on shabbat as you would a person.</p>\n\n\n",

Why do we Poskin like the Bavli or do we? Is it true that the difference between Sefardim and Ashkenazim is on the Basis of this original argument and what is the source for saying so? </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I am asking for the historical developments of the Talmuds and their current day implications?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>There are lots of differences. Among the more obvious ones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Dialect - the Bavli is written in Eastern Aramaic, the Yerushalmi in Western Aramaic. There are differences in vocabulary (such as B. חזי = Y. חמי, both meaning \"see\" - we in fact use both of these in the second Kol Chamira on Erev Pesach morning), in word forms (the Bavli tends to drop final ן in words like תנינא, the Yerushalmi usually preserves it), and in technical terminology (such as B. תא שמע = Y. נישמעיניה מן הדא).</p></li>\n<li><p>Presentation: the Yerushalmi is a lot briefer, and doesn't have a lot of the extensive discussion and parry-and-thrust found in the Bavli.</p></li>\n<li><p>Editorial: sometimes the Yerushalmi jumps from one topic to another without explanation (as in Sanhedrin 10:1, where after mentioning the comparison of Torah to nails it asks, without preamble, \"How many nails can be in it?\" referring to an issue about wearing hobnailed boots on Shabbos), while the Bavli will usually preface the new topic with an appropriate quotation from a Mishnah or the like. Similarly, the Bavli often spells out the corollaries that can be deduced from an Amora's statement, where the Yerushalmi won't do so.</p></li>\n<li><p>Coverage: the Yerushalmi covers all of Seder Zera'im while the Bavli doesn't. Conversely, the Bavli covers most of Kodshim while the Yerushalmi doesn't. (In both cases, though, this may be due to missing parts.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Commentaries: the Bavli has Rashi, the Yerushalmi has other commentaries (the standards in most masechtos are Pnei Moshe and Korban Ha'eidah, which certainly explain it adequately - but after all, there was only one Rashi).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reason they developed separately is simply that in that era there were two major centers of Jewish life and of Torah study, in Eretz Yisrael and in Bavel. They exchanged information constantly (through the נחותי, \"traveling scholars,\" mentioned often in the Gemara, like R' Dimi and Ravin), but still, each of them had its own distinct style of learning (see Bava Metzia 85a and Sanhedrin 24a). The Yerushalmi's development ended much earlier (and some historians say that in fact it was never really properly finished) because of Roman persecution that nearly emptied Eretz Yisrael of its Jews.</p>\n\n<p>There are occasional differences in halachah between the two Talmuds, and when that's so, we generally decide according to the Bavli. The main reason for this is that, as above, the Bavli was finished later than the Yerushalmi, so הלכה כבתראי - we follow the later authorities (since they had access to the earlier material and consciously differed with it).</p>\n\n<p>There are historians who argue that the differences between Sephardim and Ashkenazim reflect the earlier differences between the Jews of Bavel and Eretz Yisrael, respectively. Others argue that it goes back to the differences between the Jews of southern vs. northern Eretz Yisrael. Still others attribute most of them to the differences between the surrounding cultures in which they lived - Christian vs. Muslim. Historically, it is certainly true that the \"Romaniote\" communities of the Byzantine Empire were more influenced by Eretz Yisrael, and indeed some of them focused more on the Yerushalmi - I believe that the Yanina community (in Jerusalem and in New York) still does so. But then the question would really be whether the Romaniotes were the forerunners of the Ashkenazim.</p>\n\n\n",

According to this view, practically speaking there's no one today who can be identified as an Edomite, since most of the old patrician families were extinct already in early imperial times (and anyway, I doubt very much that anyone nowadays could reliably trace their ancestry back that far).</p>\n\n<p>As for your difficulty with \"the elder shall serve the younger,\" here are a couple of thoughts to chew on.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Which one is really the \"elder,\" Yaakov or Eisav? Eisav was born first, but Yaakov was the first one conceived (Rashi to Gen. 25:26, citing a Midrash). Furthermore, Eisav sold the birthright, making Yaakov the legal firstborn. You could then argue equally well that the verse is saying that Yaakov will end up serving Eisav. (I've actually come across this idea recently, although again I don't recall the source.)</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Service\" doesn't necessarily equal \"subservience.\" As an extreme example to the contrary, Rehoboam's older advisors tell him to \"be a servant to the people and serve them... and they will serve you\" (I Kings 12:7). He'll be the king and they'll be the subjects, but they'll both be \"serving\" each other in the sense that each of them is working on behalf of the other's interests.</p>\n\n<p>In Jewish tradition we have the symbiosis of the tribes of Yissachar and Zevulun, where the Zebulonites worked (as seafaring traders) and used their wealth to support the Issacharites' Torah study, and received part of the Divine reward for that. (Some of the Zebulonites also became distinguished Torah scholars through this association, and they are singled out for praise in Judg. 5:14.) The same could have been true of the relationship of Eisav and Yaakov: rather than being antagonists, they could have been partners - Yaakov with his Torah study, Eisav with his hunting in order to provide for Yaakov's upkeep (and learning from Yaakov's fine qualities in the bargain). Eisav would then indeed be \"serving\" Yaakov, but not in a demeaning and servile sense, but as one who has the privilege of assisting in an important endeavor.</p>\n\n<p>And in a sense he does. The Talmud (Avodah Zarah 2a ff) depicts G-d's judgment of the nations in order to determine what acts they've done that deserve commendation. Each one comes in turn - the Romans, the Persians, and so forth - and point out various things they've done to advance civilization - \"and all of these we did only so that the Jewish People should be able to engage in Torah.\" In the narrative, G-d dismisses this claim as foolish: \"Everything that you did was for your own good!\" The truth is, though, that their argument has merit: all of the discoveries, inventions, creature comforts, etc., that the non-Jewish world has produced can be, and should be, used for G-dly ends - like the computers, the Internet infrastructure, and the StackExchange platform which we're using for this discussion. In that sense, even now \"Eisav serves Yaakov\" by making more material resources available for Yaakov to serve G-d; what G-d derides as \"foolish\" is the fact that they don't realize this and come with this claim only when it's too late.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The verse is not sanctioning racism or racist attitudes. It is a statement about historical destiny based on the choices of these two boys and not about racial superiority. Judaism has a strong belief in the concept that choices made by individuals in the age of the forefathers had strong influence on the destiny of their progeny. The service mentioned here is with regard to service of G-d. It is a statement that Esau's descendants who choose to serve G-d will be secondary and assistants to Jacob's descendants in that endeavor. As a gentile I am sure you have heard of the concept of the \"Chosen Nation\". If you believe that the idea that G-d chose the Jewish People to be His ambassadors to the world is racist then there is nothing more to discuss. If you understand that it is a statement of the responsibility demanded of the Jewish People and that with added responsibility comes added privilege and greater consequences then you have started to grasp the meaning of the verse.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon (in his commentary <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37950&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eliyahu Rabbah to Negaim 2:1</a>, as explained in Bo'az ibid.) says that Europeans are descendants of Yafet. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is Rashi really pshat?",
    "content": "# Is Rashi really pshat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If Rashi on Tanach is a purely pshat oriented commentary, as professed several times, why do many of his comments originate from <em>midrashim</em> that most other \"pshat\" <em>meforshim</em> dismiss as \"<em>derech drash</em>\"? [For examples, see <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=21&mefaresh=ramban\">Ramban (Gen. 21:17)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=32&mefaresh=ezra\">Ibn Ezra (Gen. 32:9)</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40230&st=&pgnum=96\">Radak (Gen. 21:7)</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14264&st=&pgnum=171\">Ralbag (Josh. 24:32)</a>, and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&pgnum=277\">Abarbanel (Gen. 23; first question)</a>.]</p>\n\n<p>Did Rashi have a different definition of pshat and drash?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The original basis for saying that Rashi is always saying peshat is his statement on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 3:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואני לא באתי אלא לפשוטו של מקרא ולאגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא דבר דבור על\nאופניו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But note the end of the statement, ולאגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא דבר דבור על אופניו. Thus, some or much of what Rashi says is <em>admittedly</em> aggada, but which works well with the peshat level and resolves something. Indeed, the quote from the Lubavitcher Rebbe from Likutei Sichot even lops off the end of the quote. I personally feel that people, including many great meforshim of Rashi, have overapplied this statement. (Other Rashi scholars agree that it should not be overapplied.) I elaborate a bit on this point <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/all-kings-horses.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Besides this, \"peshat\" means different things. For example, it could mean an explanation on the peshat level of interpretation, or it could mean that only correct explanation on the peshat level. And so, one should point out that many other meforshim (Ibn Ezra, Ramban, Seforno, etc.) argued on Rashi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>It is true that there are different kinds of peshat. For example, we have <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/tnh_text.asp?id=174\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashbam's comment (to Gen. 37:2)</a> that Rashi himself, who aimed at peshat (נתן לב לפרש פשוטו של מקרא) agreed that new peshat-based interpretations are needed (והודה לי שאילו היה לו פנאי היה צריך לעשות פירושים אחרים לפי הפשטות המתחדשים בכל יום).</p>\n\n<p>That said, it is worth highlighting the approach of the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l. He takes the view that every detail in Rashi's commentary - even to the extent of which words he uses as the catchphrase (דיבור המתחיל), the citation of the name of the Tanna or Amora who gave a particular explanation, and the order in which he gives multiple explanations - is significant on a peshat level. Each of these, he says, implicitly solves some problem that could occur to a child studying Chumash (who has not yet studied Mishnah or Gemara, so that any problems that he thinks of must emerge from the text itself). Numerous talks of his over a period of some twenty years (1964 to about 1988) are based on this approach, which is summarized in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14928&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction to Likkutei Sichos, vol. 5</a>, as follows (translation is mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The central idea of these\n  explanations, as the Rebbe often\n  explained, is based on the rule that\n  Rashi himself stresses about his\n  commentary (to Gen. 3:8 and 24): 'I\n  have come only to give the simple\n  meaning.' This means that Rashi's\n  comments primarily set forth the\n  <em>peshat</em> way of learning and understanding the Torah's verses - so\n  that, in the light of his comments,\n  they become understandable even to a\n  child who is first starting to study\n  Chumash (at age five, as set forth in\n  the Mishnah). This peshat approach of\n  Rashi's - and the fact that every word\n  of his leads to the simple meaning of\n  the verse - is thoroughly illuminated\n  by these explanations...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>In view of the answers given, I would like to approach the answer to this question\nas did R' Herczeg (who translated for the Artscroll Rashi series) in his book \"<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1568712340\">Patterns in Rashi</a>\",\nin which he takes an approach similar to Josh's answer.</p>\n\n<p>To Rashi, the line between drash and pshat is vague. He viewed pshat as the simple meaning of the pasuk,\nbut only insomuch as it adheres to it grammatically and contextually. Whenever Rashi could not find\na pshat that fit with the grammar of the pasuk, he looked to Chazal's collection of aggados. He felt\nthat if an explanation of chazal fits with the grammar and context of the pasuk, it falls into the category\nof pshat. You might say he felt that it was \"pshat enough\", even though it might not be the simplest explanation.\nMany times we will find Rashi bring the popular pshat explanation, then bring a medrash from chazal. This is\nbecause he saw some sort of flaw or redundancy in the pasuk that needed to be explained. To Rashi, that is included\nin pshat.</p>\n\n<p>Besides for grammar, several other things caused Rashi to side with chazal, including juxtaposition of topics,\nunusually spelled words, and seemingly unnecessary information given by the Torah. Even though these topics are generally\nconsidered, even by Rashi, as needing only to be addressed with drash, and according to pshat they may be ignored,\nstill in certain instances Rashi felt that for some specific reason they interfered with pshat on that occasion,\nand therefore he may, in such instances, use chazal's aggados to clear things up. He considered this to be\nconsistent with the pshat approach.</p>\n\n<p>Other later rishonim disagreed with Rashi. Meforshim like Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and Rashbam viewed pshat and drash as\ndistinct categories, reserving the simplest explanation of the pasuk and that alone for pshat. What about the\ngrammatical inconsistensies in the pesukim? We will have to explain them away continuing to use pshat. There is no\nneed for the more fantastical explanations of chazal. Those are drash; they have another place, a separate place,\nin the interpretation of the pasuk.</p>\n\n<p>This is what is meant by the famous argument Rashbam records that he had with Rashi. Rashbam felt that even the\nirregularities in the text can be addressed with pshat, without the need to resort to aggados chazal. He\nclaims that Rashi conceded to him and admitted that if he had had more time, he would have included in his commentary\nthe simpler explanations that were still consistent with the grammar of the pasuk, as they were \"more pshat\" than\nchazal's explanations.</p>\n\n<p>For an extensive discussion on this topic, with an abundance of examples, I highly reccomend R' Herczeg's book.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, and I'm able to download my brain into a computer, does that mean \"I\" (i.e. my soul) can outlive my body? Could this state of existence fulfill any of the ideas contained in the Messianic Age or The World To Come (a purely spiritual existence)? Can one then mix souls together by mixing together the bits of their brains? What is the Jewish definition of consciousness?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First of all, like Shalom noted, these issues with souls and spirituality are not associated with Yemos HaMashiach according to the view we adopt from the Rambam and many others.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for, but perhaps the following will help you:</p>\n\n<p>The brain, or what one might call the \"intellect\" is definitely a core part of what we consider the soul. See Ramban (Genesis 2:7) who brings the well-known dispute between Ibn Ezra and Rambam, both of whom hold that the soul comprises of three parts: (1) living organism (like any other plants/animals), (2) living being (like animals in particular), (3) living intellect (specific to humans).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20555&st=&pgnum=44\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gra</a> interpreted this as three parts of being a \"human being\" associated with three parts of the human body. The liver representing (1) called \"nefesh\"; the heart representing (2) called \"ruach\"; and the brain representing (3) called \"neshama\".</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this helps you define what is called the soul, and the part the brain plays in the definition.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I recently came into contact with <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/34200\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nishmas Chaim</a>, by R' Menashe ben Yisrael, in which he discusses extensively many issues like this related to the soul and reincarnation with a very logical/philosophical approach. You might be interested in looking at it. (Or specifically <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34200&st=&pgnum=69\" rel=\"nofollow\">the part where he deals with the \"seat\" of the soul.</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I would take Time magazine and Kurzweil with a large grain of salt. Kurzweil think because computers have increased in certain physical measurements that they'll soon be just like humans. But there's a lot more to a human than just RAM and GHz. So far, all computers have been able to do is carry out lots extremely precise instructions very quickly. But they have not been able to think of new ideas, and obviously have no self-awareness or consciousness. </p>\n\n<p>Judaism does not make a definitive claim about where the soul is, but its obvious nowadays that a person's thoughts are connected to his brain. You won't be able to download your brain to a computer, and that will not be the World to Come. And there's no need to mix souls.</p>\n\n<p>However, computers can serve as a mashal in understanding these issues. For example, just as one can backup data on a computer, perhaps there's a \"spiritual backup\" of a person's consciousness elsewhere which is where life-after-death continues. Otherwise, one can take a dualistic approach which places consciousnesses/soul/freewill as external to the physical brain, and separate from the many functions of the brain. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>a human being is not a purely physical system like a computer.</p>\n\n<p>As the book Shaarei Kedusha explains in detail, a human being consists of two independent creatures fused together.

It is simply impossible to make a computer which can have an intelligent conversation because this is beyond the abilities of any kind of purely physical machine which necessarily functions in a direct manner, namely, one thing reacts, which causes another to react, etc. motorically. With this limitation, it is impossible to build a system capable of rational thought and intelligent speech. A computer can be programmed to calculate chess moves or the like but intelligent speech is a whole different ball game.</p>\n\n<p>and as explained there (though I think many who are indoctrinated into the scientific paradigm will violently disagree):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Likewise, even to make any kind of basic organism which can (1) grow\n  and (2) reproduce itself like a plant or even a bacterium is already\n  far too complicated for any kind of purely physical machine. It\n  likewise requires a higher form of life spirit behind the scenes to\n  coordinate and guide the development and maintenance, namely, the\n  \"nefesh tzomachat\" (growth soul of life) as explained in Shaarei\n  Kedusha.  If you ask, \"How can you say this is beyond the abilities of\n  a man-made machine? I read on the news that scientists have created\n  life in the laboratory?\" Answer: All the so-called scientific\n  \"breakthroughs\" of \"creating life in the laboratory\" that you may hear\n  about always involve modifying an already living organism such as\n  transplanting DNA strands into a living bacterium and then hoping the\n  bacterium survives the transplant - but never from only raw inanimate\n  materials, since, as above, this is something that is beyond the\n  limitations of any kind of physical machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize, the article is a bunch of nonsense based on the false premise that a human being is just a machine.</p>\n\n\n",

I noticed this when I visited him a good few years ago, and assumed it was <em>minhag</em> Lubavitch.

In this case, Sefer Haminhagim has the correct vocalization as <em>zecher</em> with a segol; this comes from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5758/jewish/Iyar-11-26th-day-of-the-omer.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hayom Yom (which the Rebbe compiled), entry for 11 Iyar</a>.

However, anything that has a physical body is included in the name \"earth\" in verse 1...</p>\n<p>These words of the Ramban are what carried me when we saw men descending from a space ship on a ladder onto the surface of the moon. I thought to myself: \"What would the Rambam, who wrote that the moon has a spiritual form, answer now?\" I thought that at that point Kabbalah defeated Philosophy, and comforted myself with the words of the Ramban...</p>\n<p>We are forced to say that what the Rambam told us in these chapters [Hilkhos Yesodei Ha-Torah, chs. 1-4] is neither ma'aseh merkavah nor ma'aseh bereishis. Rather, he wrote those four chapters from his deep mind and from his knowledge of secular wisdom, i.e. not from the wisdom of Torah but only from Philosophy... and the Rambam only wrote these as an introduction to the Mishneh Torah while the main part of the book begins with chapter 5...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam in  Yesodei Hatorah Ch.3 discusses the Galgalim, the celestial spheres at length. He says they are nested one on top of the other like the layers of an onion. His source is Aristotle.

In halacha 2 the פירוש says the Rambam source for halacha 2 is the \"חכמת התבונה\", the astronomers. In halacha 5 he equates this with \"חכמי יון\", indicating that the Ramabam's source is the Greek philosophers and astronomers.</p>\n<p>The ספר אמונה ותורה brings from the ספר הברית, writen by a big Talmid Chacham, Rav Pinchos Eliyahu Horowitz (1765-1821) The אמונה ותורה writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועיין בספר הברית (ח\"א פ\"ה) שהרמב\"ם הלך בזה אחרי דעת אריסטו, וזהו בעצם דעת רב אחא בן יעקב בפסחים ס\"פ מי שהיה טמא, אבל לדידן הגלגל רק רוחני, וכן הסכימו התוכנים שאין הכוכבים בתוך גלגל ודלא כהרמב\"ם שמפרש כפשוטו.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See the Sefer Habris(1,5-6) who writes that the Rambam [by writing about the spheres] followed the position of Aristotle, and this is the opinion of Rav Acha the son of Yaakov in Pesachim, however for us the spheres are only a spiritual entity, as the scientists have agreed that the stars are not inside of physical spheres, and not like the Rambam who interpreted the spheres simpily [as physical]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam is describing the physical world according to the best knowledge of the science of his time. Today, science is more advanced. Now, it is accepted that the movement of the stars is not because they are inside of revolving spheres, but as a result of gravity. This should in no way diminish from their greatness in Torah, which is much greater than ours.\nWe don't need to accept the theory of Evolution, it's just a theory. However, since the spaceships were able to land on the moon without banging into a sphere, there is clear proof that the celestial spheres-גלגל around the Moon and Stars don't exist .</p>\n\n\n",

He says it's actually </i>from<i> (not, as I had suspected, cognate to) German </i>Kräppel<i>, \"a fried pastry\", related to </i>Krapfen<i>, etc. (See there for all the gory details.)</i></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Yiddish word kreplach is plural of krepl, a diminutive of krap or krep which supposedly comes from Yiddish's primary ancestor language, Middle High German, where krappe or krapfe meant \"a (unit/serving/piece of) pastry\".</p>\n<p>From the same source come the German Krapfen (\"deep-fried pastry\") and its East Central German dialectal variant Kräppel,  which sounds identical to the singular form of the Yiddish word \"krepel/kreplekh\" / \"קרעפּל/קרעפּלעך\".</p>\n<p>Duden's etymological information about the word \"Krapfen\"/\"Kräppel\" is as follows:</p>\n<p>Krapfen, m[asculine noun, der] : \"a bakedgood/pastry fried/baked in fat/lard, [i.e.] doughnuts/pancakes/Pfannkuchen ([the meaning & word is] predominantly Upper German),\nOld High German, krapho ‘hook, claw, similar shaped pastry’ (9th century), Middle High German \"krapfe\"/\"krap(p)e\".<br />\nThe noun has been traced back to [metathesis and therefore a sound change based on] labial extension [a labial addition to the sound], ie.  \"*greb-\" [the Indo-European word root &] the word root [of that is/was] \"*ger-\" which means \"to turn, to wind[, to twist or manually spin]\" (whence/therefore also [the words] : ↗Kringel/[\"ringlet/curl/loop & \"a looped/curled a type of pastry\") ↗Krampe =cramp, ↗Krampf[=cramp], ↗Krume[/Mod.Hi.German:Krumme =crook&crumb], ↗Krüppel[=cripple]; no further data.  Diminutive forms [of Krapfen] are Kräpfchen, Kräpfel(-ein), Middle German [dialect]'s Kräppel(-chen).</p>\n<p>[Krapfen, m. ‘in Fett gebackenes Gebäckstück, Pfannkuchen’ (vorwiegend obd.), ahd. krapho ‘Haken, Kralle, ähnlich geformtes Gebäck’ (9. Jh.), mhd. krapfe. Das Substantiv ist auf eine Labialerweiterung ie. *greb- der Wurzel ie. *ger- ‘drehen, winden’ (wozu auch ↗Kringel, ↗Krampe, ↗Krampf, ↗Krume, ↗Krüppel, s. d.) zurückzuführen. Landschaftliche Deminutivformen sind südd. Kräpfchen, Kräpfel(-ein), md. Kräppel(-chen).]</p>\n<p>If this is so, Krampf \"cramp\", Kringel \"crooked or looped pastry, squiggle, curl, loop\", Krüppel \"cripple\", Krapfen/Kräppel \"do(ugh)nut\", & \"krepel/kreplekh\" / \"קרעפּל/קרעפּלעך are all related words.</p>\n<p>There are, therefore, many other words related to \"Krapfen/Kräppel\"/קרעפּל  through the Proto Indo-European word root, \"*ger-\".</p>\n<p>Proto Indo-European word root informations listed in the rest of this article are copied here from entries taken from etymonline.com & wiktionary.org</p>\n<p>*ger-  Proto-Indo-European root meaning \"to gather\" came to also be used for \"turning/herding\" something & not merely \"cramming\" (from this PIE root through \"*gremb-\") or bringing things together.  \nIt forms all or part of: aggregate; aggregation; agora; agoraphobia; allegory; category; congregate; cram; egregious; gregarious; panegyric; paregoric; segregate.\nIt is the hypothetical source of[ &/or ]evidence for its existence is provided by: Sanskrit gramah \"heap, troop;\" Greek ageirein \"to assemble,\" agora \"assembly;\" Latin grex \"flock, herd,\" gremium \"bosom, lap;\" Old Church Slavonic grusti \"handful,\" gramota \"heap;\" Lithuanian gurgulys \"chaos, confusion,\" gurguolė \"crowd, mass;\" Old English crammian \"press something into something else.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, words related to the more recent PIE word root \" *greb-\"/\"*g(h)reb(h 2)-\" would seem closer in meaning to \"krepel/kreplekh\"'s origin, but words related to PIE \"*gremb-\" are just as close while \"*ger-\" is further distanced in meaning except that the secondary meaning of \"*ger-\" is \"turn/twist/curl\" & you can see how that second meaning is tied to \"*greb-\" (\"bent/hook(ed)\" shape & verb), \"*g(h)reb(h 2)-\" (\"grab/grasp/hook/take\"), & \"*grem-\"/\"*gremb-\" (\"cram(med)\"; \"hooked/crooked, bent, not-straight\") forms having \"curled/unstraight\" aspects to their meanings & all share the PIE metathesis of \"*ger-\" to \"*gre-\".</p>\n<p>Basically,\n\"*ger-\" is \"gather\", or \"twist, turn, wind (verb)\" ,\n\"*greg-\" is \"herd, group, gathering (noun)\" (IEW: 382f) ,\n\"*greb-\" is “hook (the shape & the verb)” ,\n\"*g(h)reb(h 2 )-\" is \"grab/hook( verb), seize, grasp’ (IEW: 455) ,\n\"*gremb-\" is “crooked, uneven” .</p>\n<p>As pointed out by the user who mentioned \"grappler\"/\"grapple\":\nThe modern English word, grape is also from Middle English grape, from Old French grape, grappe, crape (“cluster of fruit or flowers, bunch of grapes”), from graper, craper (“to pick grapes”, literally “to hook”), of Germanic origin, from Frankish *krappō (“hook”), from Proto-Indo-European *greb- (“hook”), *gremb- (“crooked, uneven”), from *ger- (“to turn, bend, twist”). Cognate with Middle Dutch krappe (“hook”), Old High German krapfo (“hook”), whence: German Krapfen (“Berliner doughnut”).</p>\n<p>According to the German dictionary by Jakob and Wilhelm (\"The Brothers\") Grimm, there is also the adjective \"krapp\" which means 'hard baked' in the Lower Rhine region.</p>\n<p>The Scottish English noun \"crump\" means \"old, hardened/stale bread\" or an older meaning (becoming obsolete) \"fresh (intentionally/accidentally) hard baked bread\".\nIt is clearly reported in academia to be related to \"crumb\", which comes from proto Germanic \"*krumbaz\", also related to Proto Indo-European \"*gre-\" through \"*gremb-\".</p>\n<p>Whereas, \"crook(ed)\" comes from Middle English croke, crok, from Old English *crōc (“hook, bend, crook”), from Proto-West Germanic *krōk, from Proto-Germanic *krōkaz (“bend, hook”), from Proto-Indo-European *greg- (“tracery, basket, bend”), from PIE \"*gre-\".\nIt is cognate with Dutch kreuk (“a bend, fold, wrinkle”), Middle Low German kroke, krake (“fold, wrinkle”), Danish krog (“crook, hook”), Swedish krok (“crook, hook”), Icelandic krókur (“hook”).</p>\n<p>So, to summarise, \"crook(ed)\", \"crump\" & some senses of the words \"crumb\", \"crumpet\" (through \"cram\" & \"cramp\") are related to the origin of the Yiddish word \"krepel/kreplekh\".</p>\n<p>Originally, at least since the 9th century, Krapfen/Kräppel & other items like donuts were mainly used as festive breads & \"fasting biscuits\" [lard laden buns/pastries with fillings] and they became increasingly popular in the Roman Catholic areas of Europe during the carnival period of fattening festivities for physical preparation during what's ostensibly a time of spiritual & physical preparation for 40 days of fasting during all the days of the holiday called Lent, which precedes the Christian pascha(l) (or Easter related) holidays of passion/suffering week & so forth.</p>\n<p>European Christians used pork lard in these breads or pastries so of course all Jewish bakers & pastry makers or cooks would use a different & kosher form of lard or fat.</p>\n<p>Therefore, kreplakh (the kinds which were not of the dumpling variety) are & were often made with some form of fat in the dough & they were also pan or pot fried in a fat or lard (such as beef, chicken or vegetable derived fat (\"schmaltz\") mostly for the savoury & dumpling versions of the kreplakh.</p>\n<p>Both, the fried pastry or the boiled dumpling type of kreplakh, never had animal fats whenever the kreplakh were made in any way that had dairy in the middle (such as a sweet soft cheese or yellower cheeses).</p>\n<p>I mention all of that about Christians & kosher practices because there is a suggestion I have heard said by many I have asked about the dish (over the course of my life).</p>\n<p>The suggestion I have heard very often is that the dumpling kind of kreplekh caught on so much more than the fried kind among Yiddish speakers because of how difficult it could be to source enough kosher fats for frying more than one kreppel during anything other than important Jewish holidays,  because its easier to eat well in preparation for a fast & the special occasions make it more likely kosher slaughters have been performed in a high enough number for someone to finally have enough fat make a bunch of the kind of fried & filled (savoury/meat or sweet/jelly/fruit) kreplekh that don't conflict with eating meat dishes.</p>\n<p>By Jewish folk etymology, the three consonants in the word \"קרעפּ\" (\"KREP\") has been sometimes explained as standing for the initials of three festivals: K for Kippur, R for Rabba, and P for Purim, which together form the word Krep.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it may indeed turn out that \"cripple\", \"Krepel/kreplekh\", \"Kräppel/Krapfen\", \"crumpet\" & \"crump (hard bread)\" & \"crump(-s/-ed/-ing, as in \"crumpling\")\" & \"crumple\" & \"crumble\" & \"crumb\" & \"cramp\" & \"cram\" &  \"grape\" & \"grapple\", \"crook (\"the kitten fell asleep on the crook(s) of my arm(s)\")\" & \"crooked\" all seem to be related with most of the \"grab/cram/crumple/hook (verb&noun)\" forms being related to the shape of a hooked hand or an hook object & the verb of doing so to grab things from the earlier sense of \"*ger-\" (\"bring together\") which somehow led to \"the hook shape\" & \"turn/twist\" being the sense carried in derived forms that gave rise to \"crumple/crumble/crinkle/wrinkle\" senses relating to the \"turn/twist\" sense & the words like \"cram\" bring related to the \"gathering\" sense.</p>\n<p>\"Cramp\" & \"cripple\" are related to the \"hooked/seized/grabbed/spasm\" sense which is related to the \"twist/turn\" sense, just as your muscles switch & seize when they cramp, I suppose.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the \"hook shaped pastry\" of the 9th century became a \"filled savoury or sweet pastry\" called \"Kräppel\" in the Central area of the modern German country's landmass by the 11th century when Middle High German was in vogue; whence the word entered Yiddish \"krepel/kreplekh\", & the plural form suffix ending in \"-ekh\" instead of \"-(e)n\" due to slavic languages' influence on Yiddish by the 13th century.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading & please chase down any corrections if you find them.</p>\n<p>P.S. I am aware that \"(a small) crumb\" is thought to come through crumble/crumple & from Proto Germanic \"*kremma\", but I assure you the experts are almost sure that particular \"uncertain origin\" of the PG verb comes from PIE \"*grem(b)-\".</p>\n\n\n",

Yehoshua had just completed it, and therefore Hashem said to him \"chazak ve'ematz\" (1:6,7). Abudraham infers from this that when one completes a sefer of the torah, we should say \"chazak\".</p>\n\n<p>(2) Torah is something that requires strength to continue learning, as seen from a couple of Talmudic sources, so we wish ourselves strength in our continuation through the next sefer.</p>\n\n<p>(3) It is in the same vein as when we say \"hadran alach\" after finishing a maseches, or saying \"Yiasher Kochacha\" to a chazan, meaning that we (or he) should merit to continue studying or doing mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>One cute theory: It used to be that the entire congregation would recite the last posuk aloud (like the pesukim on fast days, for instance) Therefore the instructions \"Chazan v'kahal\" were put next to the last posuk, in abbreviated form, חוק which looks a lot like חזק. This is discussed in one of R. Schachter's books on the Rav.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Another reason is that חזק equals 115, and 3x חזק equals 345, which is the gematria of Moshe. So we are thereby celebrating having finished one of the books given to us by Moshe.</p>\n\n\n",

In this case, I would say that the predominent (I don't mean that as biggest) component would be meat - therefore it is Shehakol. By predominent I mean the 'defining ingredient', for example, cheese and tomato pizza - you'd make the brocha based on the pizza base (no pun intended) - because it defines what you're eating. It is what defines it as pizza. Similarly, in my opinion, the meat is what defines the stew as cholent.</p>\n\n<p>One last example, in the UK, a well known student food is chips (french fries) topped with cheese - these 'cheesy chips' are 'ha'adama' - yes, the cheese is nice, but people are eating it as something that compliments the chips.  I would say similarly for cholent. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Cooking Cholent Right before Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there anything wrong with putting up a cholent to cook right before Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Some background:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara is concerned that if people leave a pot on the flame starting Friday afternoon, a person may get impatient for his dinner and stir the pot around on the flame, or play with the flame, to get it to cook faster.</p>\n\n<p>The normal recommended alternative is if you want to leave a pot cooking from before  Shabbos, you must make sure the food is at least 1/2 (some say 1/3) cooked before shabbos begins, that way, it's already \"minimally edible\" and hence \"cooked.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another option suggested is to take something large, raw, and needing a long cooking time, and putting it up immediately before shabbos -- you have no hope that this will cook in time for dinner Friday night, no matter how you play with it, so you'll leave it until the next day.</p>\n\n<p>By this logic, if someone had a large pot of cholent containing large chunks of frozen (raw?) meat and raw potatoes, if an hour or so wouldn't be enough to cook it, it could be put up right before Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Major caveat: Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, the premier halachic authority of America for several decades in the early-to-mid 1900s, felt that a \"will take too long to cook\" setup as described by the Gemara didn't pertain to today's kitchen appliances, so he felt this option was no longer available. (This appears in the Ezras Torah calendar, which follows his rulings.) I don't know which other rabbis say what.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Shulchan Oruch Harav rules that one may put raw meat (beef specifically, which takes longer to cook) into a pot and into an oven to cook slowly just before Shabbos. The reasoning is that since it will take a long time to cook, a person will not come to stoke the coals, or otherwise interfere with it and desecrate Shabbos - he knows it needs to cook the entire night. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, placing raw meat into an oven to <em>roast</em> would be not permitted since it takes less time to cook and will become edible that evening. There is then a danger that a person might forget that it's forbidden to interfere with it and come to desecrate Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>It would follow that it is permitted to put the cholent in a slow cooker just before Shabbos, if it contains raw meat. A slow cooker on a low setting takes 6-8 hours to cook a cholent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT by sabbahillel</strong> Note that one must tape over or disable the control knob so that the setting cannot be changed once it is plugged in. This would prevent it from being turned up or down during Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, it is best to consult a competent orthodox rabbi. Try askmoses.com or chabad.org</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If you either put a blech <em>or</em> threw raw meat in just before shabbos, the only problem will be that your beans may not get cooked.</p>\n\n\n",

Daas Zekeinim on that verse in fact explicitly states that this prohibition took effect once Moshe put them in).</p></li>\n<li><p>Or, וישם in 40:20 may be meant in the same sense as ושמו בדיו in Num. 4:6, where Ramban writes (second explanation) that it means to adjust them to the correct position. (As pointed out in Yoma 72a, the staves could slide back and forth in the rings, they just couldn't be removed completely.) So then it would mean that Betzalel placed the staves into the rings, and then when Moshe set down the Aron in its proper place in the Kodesh Hakodashim, he slid them into another position (perhaps so that they'd bulge out of the paroches, as later in the first Beis Hamikdash - Yoma 54a explaining I Kings 8:8).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&pgnum=100\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meshech Chochmah</a> writes (paragraph beginning וע\"ד המושכל) that the staves had to always remain with the Aron in order to demonstrate that the Aron \"carried its bearers\"; removing them when it was at rest and attaching them only for transit would falsely imply that they were actually needed in order to carry it. <a href=\"http://www.menorat.co.il/index.php?pid=c2&arid=000067\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> expands on this idea to point out that the order in 40:20 is significant: first the luchos had to be placed in the Aron (to \"activate\" its power to carry itself and its bearers), and only then could the staves be attached to it. This would seem to fit with my first answer above: Betzalel put in the staves and then took them out, and Moshe again attached them after he put the luchos inside.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I see where Meshech Chochmah also <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&pgnum=123\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a> (paragraph beginning ויקח) that the staves were at the sides of the Aron when it was in transit, but that they \"placed them atop the sides of the Aron, making them lie across the top of the Aron\" when they set up the Mishkan. (Which, I guess, means that he holds that the mitzvah to \"not remove the staves from the Aron\" means that they should always be somewhere nearby, but not that they have to remain in the rings.) He uses this to explain the apparent contradiction between the two verses: Betzalel placed the staves into the rings, and Moshe removed them and laid them atop the Aron.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Oops, I missed that Alex added this answer above, but I'll keep it here for the comments.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&st=&pgnum=123\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meshech Chochma</a> answers that Betzalel placed the staves in the rings on the side of the Aron. This was its mobile positioning.  When Moshe set the Aron in place, he set the rings and the staves within on the top edges of the aron's walls.  This was its resting position.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, if you whip them off before kaddish there's plenty of time to put them away before the shliach tzibur starts amidah.</p>\n\n<p>Some elderly gentleman once pointed out in shul that if you don't wind them up but leave it till after amidah, you should cover them up out of respect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The reason we take off our tefillin before mussaf is</p>\n\n<p>(1) because many say in the kedusha of mussaf, \"Kesser Yitnu Lecha\", and therefore we need not be wearing the \"kesser\" of tefillin. (Or I heard once that perhaps it is disrespectful to say \"Kesser Yitnu Lecha\" while we are wearing our own \"crowns\" of tefillin.)</p>\n\n<p>(2) Even for those who don't say \"kesser etc.\" in the kedusha, since we try to treat Rosh Chodesh somewhat as a Yom Tov, at least while we say mussaf (which is memorial to the korban mussaf brought in the Bais Hamikdash), we take off our tefillin beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>I have only ever seen people take off their tefillin after kaddish, and it seems this is the proper procedure, since one should have his tefillin on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=68\" rel=\"nofollow\">for all the Kaddishes said by the chazzan</a>. Perhaps, though, some people feel they may take them off early as per reason (2).</p>\n\n<p>However, we try not to create a long gap between kaddish and mussaf, and therefore we do not wrap the tefillin until later. In many places, the gabbai or chazzan bang on the amud or bimah to signal everyone to start mussaf, since everyone should begin together.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&st=&pgnum=209\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taamei Haminhagim</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Binyamin Tabory said once in a Shi'ur that he personally takes off his Tefillin \"early\" - during UVa LeTzion - in order to avoid the problem of leaving his Tefillin in a heap (which he said was disrespectful - I think he called it a Bizayon, but I'm not 100% sure) during Musaf.</p>\n\n<p>He did not cite any sources other than RJB\"S, but he felt it was not necessary to wait until after Kaddish to remove them, and he felt more strongly that it was inappropriate to wait, because of the likelihood that they will not be treated properly when one is in a rush to keep up with the Sha\"Tz.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although I don't have a written citation, I personally heard from Rabbi Haskel Lookstein that since the purpose of the half-kaddish is to introduce Mussaf, the Rav felt that tefillin should be removed before kaddish. Rabbi Ari Enkin also <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/10/rosh-chodesh-removing-tefillin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">describes and agrees with</a> this approach, citing the <em>Siddur Baal Hatanya</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Halachic Positions of Rav Joseph B Soloveitchik volume 3</em> (section 4 pages 9-10),  Aharon Ziegler states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The minhag has been universally accepted that we take off our tefillin right after the shaliach tzibbur recites the kaddish following UVA LETZION, right before the silent shemoneh esrei.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>although this is not cited in the Rav's name. </p>\n\n<p>However, he goes on to relate the Rav's insistence that enough time be provided to properly wrap the tefillin before Mussaf, as it would be \"a far greater violation\" to leave the tefillin unwrapped than to leave them on.</p>\n\n\n",

However, even according to the more stringent view, reporting would be permitted under two primary exemptions: where the secular system judges by the same rule as a Jewish court would (as there is no damage caused), and a case where one reports a violent and potentially dangerous person. Rabbi Broyde elaborates at length about what constitutes such an exception, but notes towards the end of the article that even according to the most stringent view, someone who is known to regularly abuse others should be reported promptly to local authorities to prevent further physical harm as well as Chillul HaShem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Here's what I heard from <a href=\"http://www.wsat.org/emeritus.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz</a> on the subject:</p>\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan (living in Russia a hundred years ago) wrote that if a government's laws are fair to everyone, \"like England's laws, or the Glorious Czar's\", then no prohibition of <em>mesira</em> (\"snitching\") applies.</p>\n<p>Some feel that the entire sentence was written to placate the censor, and none of it is accurate.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Breitowitz, however, felt that what happened was, Rabbi Epstein first truthfully wrote the following halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a country's laws are fair to everyone, like those of England, then no prohibition of <em>mesira</em> applies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then realized what would happen to him if he implied that the Glorious Czar's laws weren't so wonderful, so he added in \"or the Glorious Czar.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Breitowitz then stated that some poskim (Rav Wozner, if I recall) go further and say that any time halacha recognizes the state's laws (<em>dina d'malchusa dina</em>), then there is no prohibition of <em>mesira</em> to help the government enforce those laws.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rabbi Hershel Schachter is known for pointing to a Gemara of a rabbi who would point the Roman authorities to circumstantial evidence that a Jew was a thief, for which the Romans could give the death penalty.

In the case of a Jew who was caught stealing Torah ornaments and it's up to the synagogue to decide whether to press charges, Rav Moshe noted that halacha would require a monetary fine but no jail time; if pressing charges would send this fellow to jail (a potentially hellish experience), he recommended against it.</p>\n<p>Traditionally there were also cases where a fellow's crime (e.g. counterfeiting) would reflect badly on the entire Jewish community and lead to more persecution; I don't know how/if that would apply today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh6/11/1/11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav Choshen Mishpat, The Laws of Damages to Body and Soul, Paragraph 11</a>, quoting the Rambam and the Shulchan Aruch, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן המוסר אפילו ממון קל של ישראל ביד נכרים אם הוחזק במסירות ג' פעמים מיתתו בכל אדם מפני שהוא כרודף כמו שנתבאר בהלכות נזקי ממון</p>\n<p>Whoever reports even a small amount of Jewish money to the Non-Jews, if he did it 3 times anyone can kill him because he is like a Rodef (someone running after someone to kill him - the law is one can kill him first), as is explained in the Laws of Monetary Damages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Laws of Monetary Damages he explains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This applies even these days (when Beit Din does not have the power to kill) - see <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh6/10/1/7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>One may pre-emtively kill him before he reports</li>\n<li>After he reports one may not kill him, unless he's already done it 3 times, in which case it is assumed he will do it again and one may kill him. - see <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh6/10/1/8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

How much more would you be required to pay in order to help someone stay in business?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>One of the places it's addressed is the first halachic case of copyright infringement: in the mid-1500s, Rabbi Moshe of Padua (known as \"Maharam Padava\" in yeshiva circles) put a great deal of effort into typesetting and printing an edition of the Rambam; shortly thereafter, some non-Jewish printers copied his work with slight tweaks and began selling it. Rabbi Moshe wrote to his cousin, Rabbi Moshe Issreles (the Ramah), who responded firstly that they were employing illegal business practices, and additionally that it's a mitzva to buy from a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>The shiur I heard on the subject (recorded several years ago in Kew Gardens Hills) concluded (and I'm afraid I don't recall the source here) that one should be willing to spend \"a little more\" to give his business to Jews; no good definition of what's called \"a little more.\"</p>\n\n<p>What if the Jewish and non-Jewish sellers have the same price, but the non-Jewish seller is significantly more convenient? Do we say time is money? The shiur quoted an opinion from over 100 years ago that you always must inconvenience yourself to buy from the Jew, and concluded that with our busy lives today where time=money, that's not as clear-cut.</p>\n\n<p>Final caveat, heard from Rabbi Breitowitz: the preference of giving business to Jews is only where it's an identical product. But if it's between the equally-kosher Schmerel's Pizza and Pablo's Pizza (let's assume Schmerel is Jewish and Pablo isn't) and you significantly prefer the taste of Pablo's Pizza, you're not expected to buy something you don't like as much!

Shalach Manos? on the Night of Purim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mishloach Manos is a Purim-day mitzvah. There's talk about asking a proxy in advance to deliver them on Purim day for you, which should probably be okay.</p>\n\n<p>Matanos L'Evyonim should either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be received so the poor person can have/use it on Purim.</li>\n<li>Be set aside by the giver on Purim.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You're not supposed to give matanaos l'evyonim too long before Purim, as the poor person may have already consumed the gift by the time Purim comes around. (And if someone is struggling, to hand them a large check and say \"you can't use this until next week!\" shows you're missing the point.)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, \"if you look around on Purim day and there are no poor people in the town\", you can either set aside the money on Purim day, to use later; or mail the money on Purim day. </p>\n\n<p>So if your synagogue has a collection a few days before Purim (or Purim night) that will be distributed on Purim day, that's fine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A number of rabbonim will collect earlier because they know of poor families that require the help. You can give to organizations that give out meals on Purim so that families can have a seudas Purim and do not have to buy for themselves. I would think that it might be better to give through an organization or Rav because the money will be collected and used to buy sufficiently for the aniyim to get sufficient for their needs as what one individual can afford to give may not be enough.</p>\n\n<p>Many organizations nowadays sell cards showing that you are giving matonos l'evyonim rather than mishloach manos. As long as you give the required mishloach manos, this is actually considered better for you to do.</p>\n\n\n",

But since Pirkei Avos (4:12) says that \"your awe for your teacher should be like your awe towards G-d,\" the following would seem to be relevant.</p>\n\n<p>There is a well-known story (<a href=\"http://www.shturem.net/index.php?section=artdays&id=1446\">this article</a>, in Hebrew, collects over a dozen versions of it) where a yeshivah student, in his role as a Purim Rav, says something insulting about the rosh yeshivah. When he goes the next day to ask the rosh yeshivah's forgiveness, the latter replies:</p>\n\n<p>\"They say that what's on the lung of someone who's sober, is on the tongue when one is drunk (in Yiddish, <em>vos bai a nichteren is oifen lung iz bai a shikker oifen tzung)</em>. Well, then, when we slaughter an animal, why do we need to go to the trouble of checking its lungs for adhesions (sirchos)? Give it some liquor to drink before the slaughtering, and you'll see on its tongue whether there are any problems.</p>\n\n<p>\"Evidently, then,\" concludes the rosh yeshivah, \"this rule applies only to people, not to animals.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the rosh yeshivah is allowing that what the erstwhile Purim Rav said (what was \"on his tongue\") may not really represent what he really feels deep inside (\"on his lung\"); at the same time, though, he implicitly calls him \"an animal\" for having failed to control his speech.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, plus the fact that most Purim Torah is composed when one is sober (so that this excuse wouldn't even apply), I would say that it's best to be careful to not cross any such lines even as a joke.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Charvona? How many Charvona's were there?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Megila twice the name Charvona is mentioned. However there is a difference - Once it is spelled with an Aleph at the end and once it is spelled with an Hai at the end? Were there two Charvona's or was it the same person? If it was the same person, then why the spelling change?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It was the same person.</p>\n\n<p>Many times we find people in Tanach mentioned in different places with their names spelled differently. Like Chizkiyahu sometimes has a yud in front of his name making it Yechizkiyahu, or Tzidkiyahu is sometimes Tzidkiyah without a vav at the end. In Megillas Esther, we find Bigsan becomes Bigsana later, or as you pointed out, Charvona with an aleph becomes Charvona with a hay. Although these differences do not mean we are referring to different people, they may yet have deeper meaning attached to them.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to Charvona specifically, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44288&st=&pgnum=87&hilite=\">Maharal</a> writes that it is spelled with a hay later in the megillah to hint that he was influenced by God to speak up to Achashverosh concerning Haman's misdeed. (Letter hay is symbolic of God.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37460&st=&pgnum=203&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medrash Rabba Esther 10:9</a> the second time it says Charvona it is written with a Hai as it was Eliyahu Hanovi in the guise of Charvona.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As Gershon <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/6323/1535\">answered</a>, the Midrash identifies the latter Charvona spelt with a Hey as Eliyahu Hanavi. (The Rama (OC 690:4) cites this as the basis for the phrase \"וגם חרבונה זכור לטוב\" - \"Charvona who is remembered for good\" in <em>Shoshanas Yaakov</em>, [although the Gemora says that the original Charvona was in fact evil and part of Haman's wicked plot]; since this was really Eliyahu Zachor Latov disguised as Charvona).</p>\n\n<p>The Alshich (Masaas Moshe to Esther 7:9) questions how the Midrash could possibly claim that Charvonah was Eliyahu, as the verse explicitly <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16480/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> that he was \"one of the chamberlains before the king\". He explains that it is actually derived from this very phrase. The words \"before the king\" seem superfluous, as it would have been sufficient to just write that Charvona, one of the chamerlains said. Rather, expounds the Midrash, ony \"before the king\", he apeared to be \"one of the chamberlains\", but in truth he was Eliyahu Hanavi. He writes that this is also alluded to by spelling Charvona differently from his prior mention in the Megilla, to hint that it was not the same person. He adds that the letter Hey corresponds to the five letters in the name אליהו.</p>\n\n<p>The Shu\"t Mayim Chaim (Siman 22) explains why specifically the letter Aleph was changed to Hey: There is a law in Hilchos Gittin (EH 129:34) that names in Loshen Hakodesh are spelled with a Hey at the end, whereas names in foreign languages are end in an Aleph. Therefore the wicked chaimberlain was named חרבונא, while Eliyahu Hanavi was called חרבונה.</p>\n\n<p>The Chida (Kisey Rachamim, Mesechtes Sofrim 14:6) brings from the Arizal that Charvona is equivalent in Gematria to \"פינחס אליהו\". (See Kaf HaChaim (OC 690:100) who explains that this Gematria works out by adding the ten letters of \"פינחס אליהו\" and the כולל).</p>\n\n<p>See also the last point to my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25798/1535\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

In MB 695:4:19 he says that drink is fine as another ‘other foodstuff’.   Therefore, you could have meat and drink as your two food items, both having the same brocha of shehakol!

If you make them foods of different brachas then you can be sure that they are certainly 'different' from each other even if you aren't an expert in the Shulchan Aruch. Having one be a food and one be a drink would also work (even if they are both shehakol). Meat from two different kinds of animals would also work, but meat Shalach Manos seem to be uncommon today. Whereas it might not be very clear if , for example, two different shehakol candies would fulfill the requirement to have two different foods, so why take chances?</p>\n\n\n",

Gematria is either geometry or our classic letter to number expounding.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest source that clearly refers to this form of numerology appears several times in the Gemara, such as the fact that yayin, wine, and sod, secret, both have a Gematria of 70, leading to the teaching that when wine goes in, secrets go out.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have found an even earlier source that uses Gematria in the latter sense - the last Mishnah in all of Shas, Uktzin 3:12, which says that the tzaddikim will inherit 310 worlds in the future, the gematria of \"yeish\" in \"to bequeath to those who love Me 'yeish' (Mishlei 8:21).\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While there are Chazals that use gimatriya in an aggadic sense (as was brought regrardic יין = סוד), there is a source for gimatriya being used in a halachic sense, as well. This is in Nazir 5a, where the Gemara derives the halacha that a default Nezirus is 30 days from the word \"יהיה\", which has a numeric value of 30.</p>\n\n<p>But the plot thickens: The Rambam in his peirush on the Mishna says that this is not an absolute d'rasha but an asmachta. Many of the mefarshei haMishna cite this view. However, see Tosafos Nazir 6b s.v Shomea. The Torah Temima (B'midbar 6,5) understands Tosafos as essentially agreeing to the Rambam, and that the d'rasha is no more than an asmachta. (Although I'm not sure why he's certain in Tosafos's words that it's merely an asmachta.)</p>\n\n\n",

I've heard that wine is preferable, and even that one does not fulfill the requirement if one gets drunk on whisk(e)y. This seems very strange to me, as the point is to get so joyfully drunk that one is unable to distinguish between two polar opposite characters. Unless one gets bumped on the head with the bottle, I'm not sure how this would be achieved with grape juice (and even then, I'm not sure that would qualify - so don't try it at home or anywhere else).</p>\n\n<p>The question as to whether this is truly a Jewish value, and what a recovering alcoholic, a teenager and anyone concerned with the dangers of drinking (with or without driving) is supposed to do on Purim is an entirely different question.  But any straightforward interpretation of the \"Mitzvah\" can lead to only one conclusion - actual drunkenness by means of alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>There are no sources cited, but this article from Ohr Yerushalayim claims that R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach said that grape juice does not suffice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yoy.org.il/article.php?id=46\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.yoy.org.il/article.php?id=46</a></p>\n\n<p>For additional reference, see Rabbi Dov Fischer's article here on the subject: <a href=\"http://www.jewishjournal.com/purim/article/drinking_does_not_drive_the_purim_celebration_20110311/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.jewishjournal.com/purim/article/drinking_does_not_drive_the_purim_celebration_20110311/</a></p>\n\n<p>He states, in part, \"Our greatest Rabbinic Sages over the centuries have wrestled with the dichotomy, looking to harmonize the themes.  One Rabbi, the Magen Avraham, noted that the gematria numerology – the sum of the letters of the words, with each Hebrew letter having a numerical value – of “Arur Haman” (Cursed is Haman) is 502.  And the letters comprising “Barukh Mordechai” (Blessed is Mordechai) also equal 502.  (See M.A. Comment 3 on Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim 695:2.)  So, he said, drink only until you can’t do the tally of those numbers in your head.  Another taught that you should drink only enough to make yourself a bit drowsy, which will lead you to fall asleep, and – unless you have a Purim dream – you then will be in state where you don’t know the difference between Haman and Mordechai. (See, e.g., Ram”a on Shulchan Arukh 695:2.)  A similar approach is taken by Rambam (Maimonides). (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Megillah 2:15).</p>\n\n<p>\"In recent years, as American culture in general, and our teen culture in particular, has grown depressingly coarse – witness television shows like “Jersey Shore” and “Skins” and a society where more people know the daily thoughts, so to speak, of Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan than they do of their Congressional representative or the Poet Laureate of the United States – more rabbis than ever have called for bans on teen drinking during Purim and also have condemned the practice of certain outlier sects who would encourage drinking to the point of barfing on Main Street.  Judaism despises drunkenness, and Rambam explicitly warned against it.

    "content": "# Non responsibility for Damages on Purim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is one not required to pay if one causes damage on Purim?</p>\n\n<p>Does it apply in all situations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The question is addressed in the poskim, I believe it gets a footnote in Shulchan Aruch at the end of the Laws of Purim. I recall hearing a tape about this a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p>In short, drunkenness alone is not a defense (see below); what may be a defense is that if the damages were caused \"as part of normally-acceptable merrymaking.\" Tosfos (France, 1200s) talks about weddings where the norms involved young men jousting; does everyone at the wedding imply they're entering at their own risk. Similar discussions occur with regards to someone getting poked by a Lulav when everyone is carrying them around. I recall another responsum about sheva-brachos dinner celebrations at which it was the norm to toast the couple, then slam your glass against the wall. (Well eventually someone lost an eye because of this ... don't ask me who started these ideas; it reminds me of a Dilbert strip which observes how weird of a habit smoking is; \"would you like the slap-yourself-with-a-sea-bass section of this restaurant?\") </p>\n\n<p>The conclusion appears to be that \"small\" damages are waived if incurred during normal merrymaking; larger damages are not. With the major caveat that the Aruch HaShulchan has none of it, damages are damages.</p>\n\n<p>So the fact that it's Purim only matters with respect to what's considered normal merrymaking activity.</p>\n\n<p>As for drunkenness: a drunk driver who kills someone is, in my humble opinion, analogous to the Talmud's case of a man walking around on a pitch-black night with an outstretched dagger; if someone is killed, you don't call that an \"accident\"; you call that \"gross negligence very close to murder.\" </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, halacha has two settings for drunkenness: \"conscious of one's actions\", and \"not conscious\" [<em>higiya leshichruto shel lot</em>].  A person can be seriously tipsy and impaired, but so long s/he is conscious of his/her actions, full responsibility (civil and criminal) of their actions would be enforceable. A person intoxicated past the point of consciousness is in the same halachic category as someone completely insane or having an epileptic attack (see Rambam's commentary to Gittin 7:1). Such a person can not be charged for criminal actions; however, with regards to monetary damage, <em>adam mu'ad le'olam</em>; if I choose to go to sleep right next to someone's expensive camera, then roll over in my sleep and break it, I'm responsible to pay for consciously putting myself in that situation. So too, there is absolutely zero mitzva on Purim to drink to this severe point, thus anyone choosing so bears full monetary responsibility for their actions.  </p>\n\n<p>The above paragraph is from a major Achron ... I believe it's the Shach ... concluding, \"and anyone who's ever studied for one day will see this is correct.\"</p>\n\n<p>A lesser-known midrash on Proverbs warns on the dangers of drinking: \"and if one strikes his fellow when severely drunk, he will not have to pay, which makes it impossible to atone for such an action.\" Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky sees this as proof that the severe drunkard is let off the hook; the more conventional interpretation would be either: a.) this is in the rare case where the person became severe drunk not due to their own decision (someone spiked their drink)  b.) the strike incurs pain and embarrassment (such as a slap on the face), but not lasting monetary damage; the former are only charged as a result of intentional action. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If the damage was unintentional, then he is exempt if he caused minor damage.\nfrom payment - Rama 695:2, Matei Moshe 1013, see Bais Yosef 695. Refer to Meseches Succah 45a, Rashi \n“miyad, Tosfas “miyad,” Shulchan Aruch C.M. 378:9. See Pri Megadim Eishel Avraham 7. Mishnah Berurah 695:13, see Refer to Bach (yeshonos) 62.</p>\n\n<p>There is an opinion in the poskim that exempts him even for physical damage, while others are stringent. \nMagen Avraham 7. Refer to Bach (yeshonos) 62. Aruch Hashulchan 10, see Elya Rabbah 15.</p>\n\n<p>The definition of damaging due to joy is unclear. In any case, the Aruch Hashulchan says that in his days the joy we have for Purim is not the type of joy which would exempt \none from paying for damage. - 695:10</p>\n\n<p>In addition, one who grabs food or drink from his friend on Purim is not considered stealing. Rama 696:8.</p>\n\n<p>Here too, the Aruch Hashulchan says that this leniency is not applicable today. - 696:12. See Toras HaYeshiva 13:14, Chazzon Ovadia Purim page 208</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Source: Halachically Speaking 10:3 page 17 (pdf)</p>\n\n\n",

This follows through to the great late 16th century masoretic scholars Rs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_Lonzano\">Menachem De Lonzano</a> (who doesn't even bother to comment on the word (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19342&st=&pgnum=48\">Ohr Torah</a>)) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedidiah_Norzi\">Yedidya Norzi</a> (who uses 5 dots and implies there are no dissenters (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14036&st=&pgnum=81\">Minchat Shai</a>)). Such is still the exclusive text in Sephardic and <a href=\"http://www.nteiman.co.il/hlacot/porim.pdf\">Yemenite</a> communities.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it so happens that in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11649&st=&pgnum=67\">two</a> most <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11650&st=&pgnum=63\">popular</a> editions of Radak available in Europe in the 16th-19th centuries, the end of his remark is truncated (finishing with \"כוותיה like it\"). Suddenly, the editor of the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=2733\">first</a> printed Ashkenazi Siddur (R Shabti Sofer ~1615) decides that the \"Radak\" must be right, and every ZKR should have 6 dots except in the phrases LeZKR Kodsho (<a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?188993&\">link</a> see notes to Berakha Mei'ein Sheva'). Then another printer (R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Hanau\">SZ Henau</a>) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35753&st=&pgnum=29\">decides</a> really Radak's opinion was that every זכר except Deuteronomy 25:19 should have 5 dots (this is a reasonable read of Radak since לית כוותיה is singular and is the standard way of denoting a single exception; however, evidence from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50258&st=&pgnum=300&hilite=\">the Mikhlol</a> suggests Radak intended the former read). Then R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden\">Yaakov Emden</a> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22024&st=&pgnum=44&hilite=\">writes</a> that he doesn't understand the fuss above since his edition of Radak (like a couple manuscripts (which clearly skipped from one בחמש נקודות to the next) and like the <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il/nnl/dig/books/bk000960070.html\"><em>editio princeps</em></a>) ended even earlier such that there is no phrase לית כוותיה to refer back to Deuteronomy 25:19, and thus <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22431&st=&pgnum=200&hilite=\">his Siddur</a> only has 6 dots. Then someone uncovers that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikraot_Gedolot#The_Ben_Hayyim_edition\">controversial</a> first edition Mikraot Gedolot (1517, ed. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Pratensis\">F. Pratensis</a>) has 6 dots in <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZI0uS.png\">Exodus 17:14</a> (this typo had already been corrected in the second \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Hayyim_ibn_Adonijah\">Ben Hayyim</a>\" <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/MG1525A.djvu/page167-3630px-MG1525A.djvu.jpg\">edition</a> ~8 years later and the third <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42687&st=&pgnum=167\">edition</a> ~15 years later) but not <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gHJhf.png\">Deuteronomy 25:19</a> (it's similarly mixed for other instances in Tanakh). So Chumashim like that get printed too. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Meir_Teomim\">Peri Megadim</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x687\">OC EA 142:1</a>) observes that \"most books have it [that way]\" and indeed in the 18th century ~40% of printings had that, though in the 17th century it was <10% and by the 19th century it was virtually 0%. Because this version remains strong <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=27811&st=&pgnum=3\">in some circles</a>, I want to point out that the text above that it's based on is so full of errors that you can see another one just in the pictures above: it should say <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0525.htm\">מִכָּל־אֹ֨יְבֶ֜יךָ</a>). As is clear, by the end of the 18th century you had most any variation floating around. (Nowadays Artscroll Siddurim have 5 dots everywhere but <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26e5.htm#7\">Psalms 145:7</a>, which is unlike any opinion above. You can even find Siddurim (ex. the pocket version of <a href=\"http://www.mysefer.com/product.asp?P_ID=4838&strPageHistory=search&strKeywords=Siddur%20Kol%20Yaakov%20(Ashkenaz)&numPageStartPosition=1&strSearchCriteria=exact&PT_ID=all\">this</a> that I have on my shelf) that print <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26e5.htm#7\">Psalms 145:7</a> differently in Shacharit and Mincha!)</p>\n\n<p>Eventually the correct text of the Radak was <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43656&st=&pgnum=91\">republished in 1857</a> (R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Heidenheim\">Wolf Heidenheim</a> used it from manuscript already in his <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il/nnl/dig/books/bk001277723.html\">~1820 Chumash</a>), and since then the fact that half of Radak's statement wasn't available to many pre-1857 was soon forgotten, and nearly all Chumashim have returned to printing things the original way, with 5 dots in every location. (For some reason, some Siddurim have lagged behind. Compare <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26e5.htm#7\">Psalm 145:7</a> in an Artscroll Siddur and Tanakh.) Indeed at first most communities resumed only using 5 dots (Arukh haShulchan makes no mention of using 6 dots in Lithuania and <a href=\"http://realiajudaica.blogspot.com/2012/02/zaykher-and-zekher.html\">testimony</a> indicates they used 5, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlin_(Pinsk)\">Karlin</a> they <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=13088&st=&pgnum=133\">only used 5 dots</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1810&st=&pgnum=344&hilite=\">same in Hungary</a>, <a href=\"https://treasuresofashkenaz.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/zeicher-or-zecher-the-reading-of-parshas-zachor-according-to-minhag-ashkenaz-and-the-shita-of-the-gaon-of-vilna/\">same in Frankfurt</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=27810&st=&pgnum=22\">same in Ukraine and New York</a>, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>But in the midst of all that confusion, two very influential rabbis had their practices (for everyone had a practice, whether it was particularly informed or not) recorded: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shneur_Zalman_of_Liadi\">first Lubavitcher</a> Rebbe <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43291&st=&pgnum=51&hilite=\">wrote</a> a homiletic explanation for why Exodus 17:14 has 6 dots while Deuteronomy 25:19 has 5 dots. Given that the words now have different senses, it's not surprising that within a century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shneur_Zalman_Fradkin\">R Shneur Zalman Fradkin</a> enacted reading both ways whenever one of those verses is read (as reported by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7722&st=&pgnum=152\">Ketzot HaShulchan</a>). Roughly at the same time, a dispute among the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\">Vilna Gaon</a>'s students as to his practice is recorded in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33900&st=&pgnum=34\">Maaseh Rav 134</a>, and, while there is much written about which side is more accurate, the \"standard\" understanding is that he likely changed from reading with 5 dots to 6 dots (for at least Deuteronomy 25:19 and Psalms 145:7) in his later years, again <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14326&st=&pgnum=348\">seemingly, to conform with the opinion of Radak</a>. In any event, this dispute was enshrined into practice (along with many other practices of the Vilna Gaon) by the Mishna Berura (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.685.18\">685 sk 18</a>) with his recommendation of reading both ways for Parashat Zakhor.</p>\n\n<p>You can hopefully now begin to understand how someone back then who sees whatever version of Radak and sees the plethora of printed variations would think this is some old fundamental Machloket which deserves explanation and understanding, when really it's a series of typos and overzealous grammarians creating considerable confusion for good Jews.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, that whole mess is why some people started doing it. I have no idea why anyone still does it now that we know how this all happened. The only people I've seen who still do this are those who are mimicking someone else's practice without knowing (or caring) what's really behind it. The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14138&st=&pgnum=435\">traditional Jewish way to deal</a> with an issue like this is to follow the majority of the older reliable texts, and there is now no longer any doubt what that entails (even if there were points in relatively recent history when certain Gedolim had inaccurate and/or insufficient data to figure that out). If you have a desire to be stringent and repeat multiple readings of verses from old manuscripts, I can suggest many which are based in serious traditional disputes (ex. Gen 9:29, Num 11:8, Deu 33:21), but if you want to be stringent about every variant mentioned in any manuscript (and even variants found only in cryptic citations in but one Rishon), you will never finish the Torah reading on a regular week before the congregation heads out for Kiddush, not to mention never having a Kosher Sefer Torah. The fact that some small towns in Europe only had a limited number of inaccurate Chumashim and/or grammatical works is no excuse for continuing to promulgate such errors today into our holy Masorah. It's high time for the memory of \"Zekher\" to be erased.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Per the Mishna Berura \"Know that some say that the word זכר should be pronounced as \"Zaicher\" with a \"Tzairai\" and some say that it should be pronounced \"Zecher\" with a \"Segol.\" Therefore, it is correct to read it twice.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah does not cite a source for the two opinions, however some have suggested that the source is the following letter by Rabbi Chaim Volozhin.

But if a non-Jew murdered a Jew, or was involved with a Jewish married woman, then he is held accountable even after conversion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting. So apparently, as you've indicated, it's not entirely \"clean-slate.\"</p>\n<p>The Talmud has stories of people who'd done horrible things against the Jews rethinking their lives, running off, and converting. Apparently we accepted them for conversion; how they work out their previous lives and regrets is between them and G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Based on the Gemara that says he is like a child <em>KiKatan Shenolad Dami</em> it would seem he has a completely clean slate like a child.But my original conclusion is wrong as pointed out by Yahu. </p>\n\n<p>In fact even the question of familial relationships is a Machlokes in a Gemara in Yevamos between Reish Lakish, who says if he had a child prior to his conversion he is still obligated, because he resembles a <em>katan shenolad</em> so the original Children have nothing to do with him.Then there is Reb Yochanan who says it makes no difference as the reality is he has children.</p>\n\n<p>They have the same argument about the status of a child born after a geirus in regards to a firstborn getting the double portion of inheritance. Reb Lakish says the child born after birth is a Bechor Reb Yochnan says no.</p>\n\n<p>Another gemara that disproves my original point is in Sanhedrin it says if someone did an <em>Aveirah</em> and was converted he is still responsible for his sin. The Chavas Yair brings an example of a ger who had stole from a Jew prior to conversion The question asked was must he return the item? the <strong>Chavas Yair</strong> said yes again proving \"<strong>no clean slate</strong>\", Another interesting Machlokes on this topic is a women who ran away with a gentile and then returned to Judaism and the gentile converted can she now marry him (If her original husband died,or divorced her) normally we say she can not marry the person she cheated with or continue living with her husband The <strong>Rabbenu Taam</strong>  as explained by the <strong>Mordechai</strong> says she is allowed to marry the man she ran away with as the Geirus makes a New man <em>Kikoton Shenolad Dami</em> MOST DISAGREE this ruling and again it seems \"<strong>No clean Slate</strong>\" </p>\n\n<p>In fact to knock the Final nail in the coffin of my original thought process the gemara in Yevamous says one of the reasons Converts suffer after converting is because they failed to keep the Seven Noachide laws earlier again disproving The Clean slate.\n<a href=\"http://www.torahmitzion.org/heb/resources/show.asp?id=759\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi Bikurim 11b states that a convert is forgiven for all his/her sins.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is wearing masks on Purim a Biblical Commandment or a Rabbinic Commandment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As we all know, wearing masks on Purim is a Mitzva. Is it from the Torah, or was it only originated in the times of Esther, making it Rabbinic?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Actually the Tzadokim (Sadducees)\n  interpreted the Torah, when it says\n  \"<em>haster astir</em>\" to mean that just\n  like <em>Hashem</em> wears a double mask, we\n  must as well. So they held everyone\n  should wear a mask on top of another\n  mask on Purim. (No wonder they lost\n  adherents and disappeared long ago!\n  Try drinking wine through two masks!) </p>\n  \n  <p>Since the ways of the Torah are\n  pleasant and it is virtually\n  impossible to drink high quality wine\n  through even one mask, we <em>Perushim</em>\n  (Pharisees - Horrors!) interpreted the\n  verse to mean that only people named\n  Esther must wear a mask on Purim. (By\n  the way, this is also the proof that\n  women do not have an obligation to\n  drink on Purim (at least not high\n  quality wine!).)</p>\n  \n  <p>However, in order to act in\n  contravention to the Sadducee approach\n  (like <em>cholent</em> on Shabbos) the Rabbis\n  enacted a decree that all those not\n  drinking beyond the medically legal\n  limit on Purim must wear a mask until\n  they get so claustrophobic and whoozy\n  from breathing their own exhaled\n  carbon dioxide that they reach <em>Ad\n  Dilo Yada</em> in that fashion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in answer to the question, it is Rabbinic but limited to those who are not drinking the amount that any sane person should drink on Purim and it was instituted after Esther's time in the middle ages of the Second Commonwealth.</p>\n\n<p>Source: </p>\n\n<p>\"Little Known and Obscure \"Factoids\" Regarding Origins of Customs in the Rabbinic Period\" </p>\n\n<p>By Dr. Markus Shapirus M.S.G.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Actually, it's not a Mitzva by itself, but it almost became one, as documented in this passage from <em>Meigillat Esther (From Esther's Joy): Transcripts of Esther's Joyful Conversations in the Wake of the Shushan Salvation</em>, by Hatach.*</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>This conversation was recorded when Esther and Mordechai were working out what the four Mitzvot of Purim should be. They had already come up with Reading the Megila, Eating a Meal, and Gifts for the Poor, and needed one more.</em></p>\n  \n  <p>Esther: Do you remember that quotation <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0531.htm#18\" rel=\"nofollow\">from Devarim (31:18)</a> that you named me after - \"הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר פָּנַי\" / \"I will surely hide My face\"? Why don't we make a Mitzva to recall that by wearing masks?</p>\n  \n  <p>Mordechai: Esther, that would indeed be a nice way to make sure everyone remembers your part in all this (as if the name of the book we're writing won't be enough), but it goes against an explicit prohibition in the Torah. Did you forget <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0234.htm#17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 34:17</a>? \"מַסֵּכָה, לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה\" / \"You shall not make a mask.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Esther: Uncle, you're taking that phrase out of context! There's more to that verse - \"מַסֵּכָה, לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה-לָּךְ\" / \"You shall not make a mask <em>for yourself</em>.\" Clearly, the prohibition only applies to making your own mask. That gives me a great idea for a detail for my new Mitzva - everyone has to make masks and give them to each other as presents. What a fun Mitzva!</p>\n  \n  <p>Mordechai: Okay, Esther, you got me there. I think we might need some more details, though. For one thing, I think the masks will need to be filled.</p>\n  \n  <p>Esther: What do you mean, filled? </p>\n  \n  <p>Mordechai: You'll see what I mean in a second, if you'll just bear with me through this exegesis. God (I can mention Him explicitly now, right?) said in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0223.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 23:15</a> \"ולא-יראו פני ריקם\" / \"And they shall not see My face empty.\" Now, clearly, this isn't talking about God's \"face\" (whatever that means), since He says in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0233.htm#20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 33:20</a> \"לֹא תוּכַל לִרְאֹת אֶת-פָּנָי\" / \"You cannot see My face.\" If we can't see His \"face\" at all, we certainly can't see it empty. So, what does the first verse come to teach us? That we can't see something else called a face when it's empty, so that must mean God's mask.</p>\n  \n  <p>Esther: What does that mean - \"God's mask\"?</p>\n  \n  <p>Mordechai: I don't know; I'm not a Kabbalist, but it doesn't matter. When we apply \"וְהָלַכְתָּ, בִּדְרָכָיו\" / \"And walk in His ways\" (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0528.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 28:9</a>), we see that we ought never present someone with an empty mask.</p>\n  \n  <p>Esther: Okay, so people have to give each other filled masks. What should they be filled with?</p>\n  \n  <p>Mordechai: Let's go back to the first verse again, where we refer to the mask as a \"face\" that should be filled. If we were talking about a flesh-and-blood king, what would he fill his face with?</p>\n  \n  <p>Esther: Ugh! Did you really have to remind me? I got a good view of that very phenomenon - twice! So, you think people should fill the masks they give each other with food and drink?</p>\n  \n  <p>Mordechai: Sure, why not? It'll come in handy at the meal we already said they should have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, although the original intention of Purim's originators was to require that Mishloach Manot be distributed in masks, specifically, that aspect of the Mitzva seems to have fallen by the wayside, leaving just the presents of food and drink. If the masks had stuck as a Mitzva, I'd probably classify it as a Rabbinic Mitzva with lots of Scriptural support.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* <em>Meigillat Esther</em> is out of print, thanks to the Yemini family's opposition to publishing these transcripts of unguarded moments, but I was B\"H able to find a scan of the manuscript on FarsiBooks.org.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Mitzva is similar to Cholent. </p>\n\n<p>There is a verse which seems to prohibit it: \"מסכה לא תעשו לכם אני יהוה אלהיכם\"\nTherefore, the Tzedukim never made masks.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4503.htm\">Drasha</a> which says that since the prohibition on making masks is placed close to the commandment to observe Pesach, one is only prohibited to make masks on Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, to show that we are not Tzedukim, we must make masks some point throughout the year. </p>\n\n<p>Since there is a prohibition to make masks on Pesach, the classes on the Halachos banning masks must have begun thirty days beforehand - on Purim.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, on Purim everyone must make masks.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover the Gematria of \"The Masks\" (130) * 3(for the amount of holes in a typical mask) is equal to the Gematria of Cholent (404) - 7 (for the amount of letters there) * 2 (the amount of times one eats cholent).</p>\n\n\n",

In the present article we will discuss the different elements of work and labor that involve some level of restriction on Purim. And while it is permitted to work, we will see that often it is not advisable</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, let's take a deep dive...</p>\n<p>Megillah 5b relates how Rebbi planted a tree on Purim. Rav Yosef <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.5b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> questions how he could do such a thing if the day is established as a festival, to which the gemara concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֶסְפֵּד וְתַעֲנִית קַבִּילוּ עֲלַיְיהוּ, מְלָאכָה לָא קַבִּילוּ עֲלַיְיהוּ</p>\n<p>The Jewish people accepted upon themselves the prohibitions against eulogizing and fasting on Purim, but they did not accept upon themselves the prohibition against performing labor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara also notes an <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.5b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">anecdote with Rav</a> who cursed a person for planting flax on Purim. From there, they conclude that it was the custom of the place to do so, and as such serves as an example where it is permitted but others have the custom to refrain from such action. Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Scroll_of_Esther_and_Hanukkah.2.14?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Megillah 2:14</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.696.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 696:1</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus there is clearly a <em><strong>custom</strong></em> not to work. This view is brought in Orchos Chaim (Purim 27), Kol Bo and Rema 696:1. Yet this is also debated...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Orchos Chaim goes so far as to write that because the custom against work has become ubiquitous, we excommunicate (cherem) anybody who works on Purim. This is also mentioned by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.696.2?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan (696:2)</a>. However, other authorities write that working on Purim does not warrant so severe a punishment (see Kol Bo; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.696.1?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi&p2=Eliyah_Rabbah_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.696.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eliyah Rabba 696:1</a>; Peri Megadim, M.Z. 1).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Birchei Yosef (696:2) writes that according to most Poskim it is not a universal custom, but rather depends on the specific location and its custom. The Rambam and Shulchan Aruch also do not note a universal custom, implying that the matter depends on local custom. These rulings imply that for Sefardim the matter of working on Purim is less severe than it is for Ashkenazim, who follow the ruling of the Rema.</p>\n<p>Even if we assume that it is forbidden to work on Purim (based on the ubiquitous custom), the Peri Megadim writes that the prohibition does not apply on the night of Purim, but only during the day of Purim. This matter is disputed, and the Biur Halacha cites both opinions. Since the prohibition is only by force of custom, one can be lenient about work at night, even for those who are stringent to refrain from work by day.</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham (1) adds that even where the customary prohibition applies, it remains permitted to do things by means of a non-Jew. This is also ruled by the Mishnah Berurah (2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, in summary work is allowed on Purim, but in some communities the custom is to refrain from labour, where it is forbidden.

    "content": "# Why 30 days of preparation for a חג\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why exactly 30 days to review the laws of the upcoming holidays? Is there anything about the number 30 that makes it significant?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>We find by the laws of mentioning rain and asking for rain that one who is on doubt if he did  or did not do so, if it is after 30 days since the change need not go back. Some hold that a correct habit can be assumed based on how many times one has said it over 30 days (at least 90 times) and others hold it is based on 30 days of practice. According to the latter opinion this can be why we start learning up the laws of a holiday 30 days before; to habituate ourselves with thinking about those laws so that it comes more natural by the time the holiday actually hits.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Pesachim 6a-b) derives the 30-day period from the fact that at the time of the first Pesach in the desert (in the year after the Exodus), Moshe told the people the laws of Pesach Sheni - which occurs one month later.</p>\n\n<p>As for the reasoning behind this: R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi (in his Shulchan Aruch, <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/429/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orach Chaim 429:1</a>) summarizes Beis Yosef and others, who point out (based on Avodah Zarah 5b) that 30 days are needed to find good unblemished animals for the sacrifices one must bring for each Yom Tov (korban pesach, olas re'iyah, etc.). So even after the Beis Hamikdash was destroyed, this rule remained in effect.</p>\n\n\n",

As  a consequence, women are put in danger by the nails which remained on the fingers and toes.  </p>\n\n<p>The gemara gives options of how to dispose of them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can dispose of them into a place where they will not be walked on.  This is referred to in the gemara as \"burying them\".  Also, the gemara has R' Yochanan throwing them in the study hall, since women don't go there.</li>\n<li>A better option is to destroy them in a way that there is no chance of them doing any more damage.  This is referred to in the gemara as \"burning them\".</li>\n<li>Transfering the nails into a different \"area\" than they were originally also takes care of the issue.  The case in the gemara was from inside to outside. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vacuuming them would certainly fulfil the 2nd option.

If so, the halacha would only apply if all three died of natural causes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My understanding is the Gemara is saying \"don't try to over-diagnose; even if you don't understand the mechanism, if it's consistently dangerous, stay away!\"</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, out of curiosity, are there any known medical conditions that could explain the phenomenon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: Any <a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/sexually-transmitted-infection\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Sexually Transmitted Disease\">STD</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Basis for answer</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>This is discussed in the Tur and the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9727&st=&pgnum=58&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch; Even HaEzer, Siman 9</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It seems (based on reading the commentators on the above) that there are 2 approaches in the Gemara and both are considered as valid in Halacha.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Medical</strong> approach</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The woman has a disease (what we'd call a STD) which results in her marital partners dying. No specific disease is named; since any STD would qualify.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the cause, then she only becomes a <em>Katlanit</em> if her husbands die early or drop dead; but not if some of them are killed or die of old age.</p>\n\n<p>This type of <em>Katlanit</em> is taken seriously, since \"danger is more serious than prohibitions\", and some Poskim would insist that the 3rd (or more) husband divorce her.</p>\n\n<p>Some commentators draw a parallel with brothers or cousins who die soon after Brit Mila; since there's clearly something <em>medical</em> happening.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Metaphysical</strong> approach</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The woman does not have any medical conditions, and her husbands may die or be killed.</p>\n\n<p>The reason could be one of bad Mazal or that she is destined to marry a particular person, and the other husbands are <em>getting in the way</em>, so to speak, and have to be disposed of.</p>\n\n<p>This type of <em>Katlanit</em> is not taken as seriously, with the Rema (ibid 9:2) going so far as to say that \"people are lenient and marry such a <em>Katlanit</em>\" and that the husband cannot be forced to divorce her.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>could also be due to not living up to the standards of her forefathers.</p>\n\n<p>for example the Talmud in Pesahim 49 says that a Bat Cohen should not marry an Am-haaretz.</p>\n\n<p>One of them could die.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For R.

This pronunciation tradition had five vowels: /a/ /i/ /u/ /e/ /o/. \nIn the 12th century, the long [aː] and [a] in an open syllable became [o] or [u] some dialects of German. Likewise, the sound [eː] or [e] in an open syllable became diphthongized into [ei] or [ai]. </p>\n\n<p>These features entered Yiddish. This in turn affected Hebrew. The qamas, which usually represents a historically long /a/ generally meets the requirements for the sound shift and became associated with [o]. Likewise, sere became associated with [ai] or [ei]. Between the 14th and 15th centuries, qamas and patah, and sere and segol became distinct.</p>\n\n<p>Because the vowel sounds in Yiddish are from the historical sound shift --- and not from the Tiberian vowels --- we get pronunciations like פֶּסַח‎ p<strong>ei</strong>sach and קַדַּחַת kad<strong>o</strong>ches. It also explains the vowel differences in pairs like: דָּם דָמִים d<strong>a</strong>m d<strong>o</strong>mim, כְּלָל כְּלָלִים kl<strong>a</strong>l kl<strong>o</strong>lim.</p>\n\n<p>See: Ilan Eldar. 1978.

For example, it may be easier for an English speaker on the fly to come up with \"they wanted to be <em>mispalel</em>\" than \"they wanted <em>l'hispalel</em>\". In this case the efficiency gain is in the simple replacement of the string \"<em>mispalel</em>\" for any grammatical context referring to that event without needing to conjugate it.

I find the explanation(s) very weak (and actually offensive).  The very next point in the article is about Karaite/Samaritan practice, and it takes a very authoritative stance on the dating of Passover from a Karaite/Samaritan point of view.  It seems highly likely that this whole section (or a good portion of it) was written by a Karaite/Samaritan.  Can someone please provide all the relevant sources for Y\"T Sheni from the Halachic perspective, so that I (or someone else with a similar desire) can update the page?

This raises a\n  Halachic issue with discarding one’s Chametz garbage into garbage bins\n  before the 6th hour on Erev Pesach, if the garbage will not be\n  collected before that time. The following is the ruling regarding this\n  matter:</p>\n  \n  <p>Bin owned by city/municipality:[2] It is permitted to throw Chametz garbage into a city owned garbage bin, even if the garbage\n  will not be collected until after the 6th hour on Erev Pesach.[3]</p>\n  \n  <p>Bin is privately owned: One may not discard his Chametz into a privately-owned garbage bin, whether it is one’s personal property, or\n  the property of one’s building, if it will remain there past the 6th\n  hour on Erev Pesach. Thus, one may not discard Chametz garbage into a\n  buildings garbage shoot if it will not be cleared out before the 6th\n  hour on Erev Pesach. One who does so, possibly transgresses the\n  prohibition against owning Chametz.[4] The following are the available\n  options in such a case:</p>\n  \n  <p>Mechiras Chametz:[5] If one sold all of his Chametz to a gentile, as is commonly done today through the community Rabbi, then according\n  to the standard sale contracts used today, all one’s Chametz,\n  including Chametz that is dirty and has no price value, is included in\n  the sale.[6] Accordingly, the Chametz that remains in the garbage in\n  truth is sold to the gentile, and one does not need to do anything\n  further to get rid of it. However, some Poskim[7] negate relying on\n  this sale regarding the Chametz garbage, and thus state one is to use\n  one of the next options.[8]\n  Disown garbage bin:[9] Disown the garbage can and its contents in front of three people. If the bin is standing in one’s property, then\n  one is to also disown that area of one’s property. In such a case, one\n  may use the garbage can throughout Pesach.\n  Spoiling the Chametz:[10] Spill bleach, or another spoiling agent, onto the Chametz that is in the garbage before the 6th hour on Erev\n  Pesach, thus making it inedible even for a dog.\n  Breaking to less than Kezayis:[11] To break the Chametz into pieces of less than a Kezayis and then discard it directly into the\n  garbage together with all the other filth.[12]\n  Burn:[13] To save all leftover Chametz starting from the last garbage pickup before the 6th hour of Erev Pesach, until the time of\n  Biur Chametz, in which case one will burn all the Chametz he has.\n  Garbage pickup:[14] To arrange with the municipality to pick up the Chametz on Erev Pesach, up until the 6th hour of the day. [Any\n  Chametz which is discarded after this pickup would need to follow one\n  of the previous mentioned option.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and the sources:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/throwing-chametz-in-garbage-before-the-6th-hour/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> See Chelkas Yaakov 3:165; Minchas Yitzchak 4:56; Shevet Halevi\n  1:137; Beir Moshe 1:41; 3:74; Betzel Hachochma 3:109; Mishneh Halacha\n  4:63; Teshuvos Vehanhagos 2:211; Kinyan Torah 2:86; 7:36; Piskeiy\n  Teshuvos 445:7</p>\n  \n  <p>[2] Minchas Yitzchak ibid writes that so is the custom, and defends\n  the practice, although concludes that it is best to pour a spoiling\n  agent [i.e. bleach] into the garbage even in such a case; Kinyan Torah\n  ibid</p>\n  \n  <p>[3] The reason: By a gentile majority city, being the dumpster is\n  owned by the gentile municipality, it is automatically acquired to\n  them [according to the opinion who rules that Kinyan Chatzer is valid\n  by a gentile]. This applies even if the dumpster is situated in a\n  private area, such as in the building courtyard, as the area of land\n  in which the dumpster is sitting on is considered rented to the\n  gentile municipality. Furthermore, even if one does not hold of Kinyan\n  chatzar by a gentile, the Chametz is considered to be disowned in a\n  public area, as the area belongs to the municipality. [Minchas\n  Yitzchak ibid; See Admur 436:20 that Chametz which is left in the home\n  of a gentile is considered Hefker and does not have to be cleaned\n  before Pesach]</p>\n  \n  <p>The law by a Jewish municipality: Some write that the above allowance\n  only applies by a gentile municipality, while in a Jewish\n  municipality, it is forbidden to leave Chametz in their garbage bins,\n  as it is forbidden to leave even disowned Chametz in the property of a\n  Jew on Pesach. [Piskeiy Teshuvos ibid based on Admur 436:20] However,\n  Tzaruch Iyun, as although in 436:20 Admur says that when placing\n  Chametz in a Jews property the decree of the sages still apply,\n  nevertheless, perhaps that only refers to a case that the property\n  belongs to one Jew or the like. However, when the property is public,\n  which is the case with the Chametz which belongs to the municipality,\n  then what difference does it make if its public to Jews or not, and\n  thus the same logic used by the Minchas Yitzchak to exempt a dump of a\n  municipality, should apply whether it belongs to Jew or gentile. To\n  note that the Minchas Yitzchak himself does not differentiate between\n  if the municipality is Jewish or not.</p>\n  \n  <p>[4] The transgression, and whether its defined as Biblical or\n  Rabbinical, is dependent on various factors, such as: 1) Is there a\n  Kezayis of Chametz; 2) Is the Chametz still edible? 3) Is the Chametz\n  dirty. 4) Was the Chametz sold to a gentile.</p>\n  \n  <p>[5] Chelkas Yaakov ibid; Teshuvos Vehanhagos ibid in name of Steipler</p>\n  \n  <p>[6] The common sale contracts that are given to the gentile include\n  the following clause: Included in the sale is all pieces of Chametz\n  found in all the mentioned areas, which do not have any sales worth,\n  and are not purchasable, they belong to the gentile. [Clause in Shtar\n  Mechira of Admur, brought in Hilchos Mechiras Chametz in end of\n  Hilchos Pesach in Shulchan Aruch Harav] Thus, anyone who has performed\n  Mechiras Chametz, under standard practice, has also sold his Chametz\n  garbage. [Teshuvos Vehanhagos ibid in name of Steipler]</p>\n  \n  <p>[7] Beir Moshe ibid</p>\n  \n  <p>[8] The reason: As if one sells the Chametz garbage, it also includes\n  the garbage bin in the sale, and forbids its use during Pesach. If one\n  continues to use it on Pesach he shows that the entire sale was a mere\n  trick, and is stealing the items of the gentile. Furthermore, it is\n  unclear if in truth Chametz garbage is included in the sale, as the\n  gentile certainly has no intent to purchase something that will be\n  removed by the city in one to two days. [Beir Moshe ibid]</p>\n  \n  <p>[9] Chelkas Yaakov ibid, in name of Agudas Eizov; Mishneh Halachos\n  ibid; Teshuvos Vehanhagos ibid; Betzel Hachochma</p>\n  \n  <p>[10] Minchas Yitzchak ibid; Shevet Halevi ibid</p>\n  \n  <p>[11] Minchas Yitzchak ibid in name of Haggadas Agudas Eizov</p>\n  \n  <p>[12] The reason: Chametz which is less than a Kezayis and is dirty [as\n  a result of the garbage] does not contain an owning prohibition if\n  disowned. [See Admur 442:28; M”A 442:10; M”B 442:33]</p>\n  \n  <p>[13] Orchos Rabbeinu Pesach 34 that so was custom of Chazon Ish</p>\n  \n  <p>[14] Minchas Yitzchak ibid that so he arranged, and so is done today</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah (431:2) says that we don't rely on Bitul (that is, being mafkir the chameitz by saying kol chamira v'chamiya) because it's possible you didn't have the full intention of getting rid of it. When you throw out your chameitz, though, you definitely have the intention of getting rid of it. Thus, it's out of your reshus and there's no issue of bal yeira'eh.</p>\n\n\n",

I was wondering what the reason is?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have heard that there are those that do not purchase dairy on Chol Hamoed for the reasons mentioned below. I have never heard of people that do not eat any dairy at all over Pesach, however maybe there are some that do not.</p>\n\n<p>Technically speaking, there is no concern with Chometz when it comes to milk. Cows eat grain, which becomes Chometz with prolonged contact with liquid. The custom to purchase dairy products before Pesach is rooted in the fear that a Chometz particle may be present in the milk.</p>\n\n<p>How does it help if you purchased your milk before Pesach? The answer is Bittul. A particle of grain would be indiscernible and also would constitute less than one-sixtieth of the milk. Therefore the grain is nullified in the milk. However, nullification applies only before Pesach begins. On Pesach we do not apply the rule of Bittul. Therefore, if the milk was in the possession of the Jew before noon on erev Pesach, any possible Chometz in the milk is nullified; hence the custom to purchase milk before the holiday.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I heard that the reason for the custom was that one is not allowed to drink milk that was milked over pesach. Before refrigeration, that leaves only the first two days one can drink milk. Given that one should meat on Yom Tov, that doesn't leave much time to drink milk. Moreover, to buy new dishes for two days(like mentioned in an answer by JXG) was expensive (they had no disposable dishes). Therefore, people didn't drink milk. </p>\n\n<p>By Pesach, the custom is to be extra stringent in Minhagim, and to avoid anything one's ancestors didn't eat, even if the reason why they did not eat it doesn't apply anymore (For example, Gebroks, Kitnyos, etc.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I know of families whose practice in Poland was not to cook dairy on Pesach, because they couldn't afford the extra set of dishes.  They drank milk, though.  Nowadays, I haven't heard of it.</p>\n\n\n",

Kibbutzim along the coast are KNOWN for dumping hametz into the water. He answers that hametz dumped before pesach is nullified in 60. During pesach, he applies the concept of \"tzonen bitzonen\". Since the hametz and water were both cold (I.e. They weren't cooked together) the flavor of the chametz doesn't spread to all the water, and as long as you're not drinking ACTUAL hametz, there's no problem with the water.

For chametz that is\n  sold is not included in the\n  nullification and the declaration of\n  ownerlessness, since he intends to\n  re-acquire it after Pesach, as\n  explained in the Rashba's responsum\n  citing Yerushalmi; Rema in Darchei\n  Moshe, and Pri Chadash, rule\n  similarly. Thus, if the sale is not\n  legally binding, one would transgress\n  the mitzvos of \"no chametz shall be\n  seen\" and \"no chametz shall be found\";\n  one must therefore be careful about\n  this.</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>The critical point is that the Jew who\n  owns the chametz has to truly agree\n  that if the non-Jew wishes, he can\n  [re-]sell all of the chametz at a fair\n  market value such as he might receive\n  in this town. Then, since he [the\n  non-Jewish buyer] knows with\n  certainty, about this transaction,\n  that he will be able to get [fair\n  value for the goods] from someone else\n  in town who will be willing to buy it,\n  then a price has been set. This is\n  similar to one who says, [\"I will buy\n  this] at the price estimated by a\n  panel of three\" - or even \"by one\n  [expert]\" - see Beis Yosef, Choshen\n  Mishpat, end of sec. 206. [And the sale is therefore valid on that basis.] It is true\n  that [the Jew] knows that [the\n  non-Jew] will not do so [find another\n  buyer to whom to resell the chametz,\n  but will sell it back to him. But this\n  doesn't matter;] since the fact that\n  he doesn't do so is out of his good\n  will, that he voluntarily wants to\n  give it back to the Jew - it is\n  considered a fully valid sale, as\n  stated explicitly in the Gemara, fifth\n  chapter of Bava Metzia, \"that [the\n  buyer] says, 'It is up to me [whether\n  to return the goods].'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on all of this, he goes on to explain how the sale should be executed in a way that is valid both halachically and (lehavdil) according to secular law.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I do sell it, simply because my rav says it is an ancient custom and we should keep it, even someone that get rid of all of his hames should have some to sell it so we don't loose the minhag</p>\n\n<p>source: ialcut iosef, if you want I can lookup where exactly</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sale of chametz is based off a tosefta where it is clearly a real sale. The fact that the Jew buys it back afterwards doesn't cancel the sale. It became common in Europe for Jews in the whiskey business to sell their chametz before pesach and buy it back after pesach. It was clearly a full sale though, since often the gentile would drink some of it on pesach. One can sell his chametz as long as it is clearly a real sale. The gentile should know what he is buying, agree on a fair price, and be able to eat some of it if he wants to. If the whole sale is just done as ritual thing without actual intent by either party in the acquisition, then it will not work, and one may end up owning chametz over pesach. </p>\n\n\n",

(I think?).</p>\n\n<p>When, and how and why, was this controversy resolved?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>As I understand it, it wasn't actually stainless steel vs. something else (stainless steel hadn't yet been invented, anyway). It's more an issue of the shape of the blade in cross-section: the \"old-style\" knife was the same thickness top to bottom (and then the edge of this was sharpened, so in profile it would be trapezoidal); the \"new\" one (called סכין מלוטש in the literature) gradually tapers towards the cutting edge.</p>\n\n<p>R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi discusses the matter in a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31632&pgnum=160\">letter</a> to the rabbis of Vilna (an excerpt of it is also published in his responsa appended to his Shulchan Aruch, no. 7).</p>\n\n<p>He reports, first of all, that R' Chaim Volozhiner quoted the Vilna Gaon as saying that there's actually no halachic problem with using polished knives; the ban against them was due solely to the early concerns about the legitimacy of Chassidus. So once it was recognized that Chassidus is not (G-d forbid) a heterodox movement, then that reason fell away.</p>\n\n<p>RSZ goes on to explain that there is in fact a halachic advantage to using such a knife. There is a chumra, based on the opinions of some Rishonim, that it must not have any detectable nicks at all (the opposing view is that small ones are fine, as long as a fingernail doesn't catch in them). With old-style knives, getting the cutting edge this smooth would usually come at the expense of its being less sharp, while with tapered knives it is easier to make the knife both sharp and perfectly smooth. So as this chumra became more widely adopted, the new knife naturally came along with it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...Most Jewish communities had been using iron knives, which were more difficult to sharpen. If they were highly polished, they would quickly become knicked, and thus unfit for use. The nuisance of constantly resharpening and repolishing them was not considered worthwhile. Moreover, the polished steel knives had been deemed a new innovation, which some authorities wished to avoid. The Alter Rebbe, however encouraged the use of the polished steel knives (see Alter Rebbe's Shulchan Aruch, Vol. 6, Responsum No. 7. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/branches-of-chassidic-menorah-2/03.htm#t13\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/branches-of-chassidic-menorah-2/03.htm#t13</a></p>\n\n<p>It appears that as steel knives stopped being an innovation and are easier to use in a factory where there is little time to resharpen the knife, the non-chassidim had no more reason to oppose their use and started using them themselves.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>All the responses above are based on Hassidic sources, so some important information and context may be missing.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the Litvish knives are/were less suceptible to pegamim (nicks, imperfections that are problematic re the kashrus of the chalaf/knife), which is an important consideration in shechita, while the Hassidic ones were sharper, but at the same time, more vulnerable to such developing imperfections). </p>\n\n<p>As stated above, technological changes need to be taken into account here as well to understand the historical background.</p>\n\n\n",

The tzizit with techelet remind the person of the ocean, which reminds them of the heavens which reminds them of the \"Kisai Kavod\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus the passage of Tzizit is a good short (instead of the passage of Bilam, which proves that Gd not Moshe wrote the Torah) replacement for the reading of the 10 commandments.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question.  We kiss the front two tzizit during Baruch Shemar since they remind us of the Kisai HaKavod and the mitzvot which are a testament to Gds works which we praise in Baruch sheamar.   We use the two front tzizit since they act as a pair of Aidim (witnesses) to what we are declaring.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the reason? Shall we say\n  because we do not know if we are descended from Reuben or from Simeon?\n  But neither do we know in the case of the matriarchs whether we are\n  descended from Rachel or from Leah! — [Rather the reason is] because\n  up to this point they were particularly esteemed, from this point they\n  were not so particularly esteemed. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Contrary to the other answers and comments, it would appear from the Talmud that the distinction between avot and non-avot is not genetic, but instead based on greatness.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, there is a different text which does refer to Moshe (along with several others) as avot. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Derech Eretz Zuta 1:16</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שבעה אבות כרותי ברית ואילו הן אברהם יצחק ויעקב משה ואהרן ופנחס ודוד\n  המלך באברהם כתיב ביום ההוא כרת ה' את אברם ברית לאמר ביצחק כתיב ואת\n  בריתי אקים את יצחק ביעקב כתיב וזכרתי את בריתי יעקב במשה כתיב כי על פי\n  הדברים האלה כרתי אתך ברית באהרן כתיב ברית מלח עולם היא בפנחס כתיב ברית\n  כהנת עולם בדוד כתיב כרתי ברית לבחירי נשבעתי לדוד עבדי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would seem to be in contradiction to the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10029-lisser-joshua-falk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

After all, it is generally accepted that Moses was Judaism's greatest individual ever, even surpassing the Patriarchs.</p>\n\n<p>This question is in fact asked by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Hayim of Baghdad</a> in his commentary to the passage in Berachot. He states that the Torah records that Moses was the greatest prophet; he received the Torah from God; and according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Luria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Luria</a> he had a greater soul than the patriarchs. Why then is he not called \"avinu\" like the Patriarchs?</p>\n\n<p>R. Joseph Hayim answers that Moses is not actually excluded from the title of \"avinu\". Of course he was great enough to merit that title. However, he has an even greater title, that of \"rabbeinu\" (our teacher), so it would actually be selling his greatness short by calling him \"avinu\". That \"rabbeinu\" is a greater title than \"avinu\" is evident from Bava Metzia 33a where the law is that the lost object of one's teacher takes precedence over the lost object of one's father.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טפי לא חשיבי. י\"ל והא איכא מרע\"ה דכתיב ביה ולא קם נביא כמשה דאפילו\n  האבות לא השיגו מדריגת נבואתו וזכה לעלות למרום וקבל תורה מהקב\"ה וגם\n  נשמתו היתה גדולה מן האבות כמ\"ש רבינו האר\"י בשער הגלגולים שהאבות זכו\n  לרוח דאצילות אברהם מן חסד יצחק מן גבורה יעקב מן תפארת אבל מרע\"ה זכה\n  לבחינת נשמה דאצילות מן הבינה גם כתב שזכה לכל ששת אלפין דרגין דנשמתין\n  כנז' בשער הפסוקים וגם במדרש וזאת הברכה דריש ואת עלית על כולנה על מרע\"ה\n  שיאמר לאברהם אני גדול ממך וכן ליצחק וכן ליעקב ואיך יתכן לומר דלא חשיב\n  כאבות וא\"כ למה לא נקרא אבינו כמו האבות זיע\"א ונ\"ל בס\"ד דאה\"ן מרע\"ה\n  חשיב טפי אך אין לו צורך בתואר אבינו כי הוא קים ליה בדרבא מיניה שקורין\n  אותו רבינו ותואר רב עדיף מתואר אב דקי\"ל אביו ורבו רבו קודם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31646&st=&pgnum=50&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr Hatorah</a> by the Tzemach Tzedek</p>\n\n<p>There are only three fathers because they embodied three characteristics that all Jews have (as an inheritance from them, because they are the source of all Jewish souls).

Since you own a share in the company, it could be considered that you're involved in the transactions. The Tosefta (BM 5:8) states that you cannot give your money to a non-Jew to lend with interest:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישראל שאמר לעובד כוכבים הילך שכרך וצא והלוה מעותי ברבית אסור ועובד\n  כוכבים שאמר לישראל הילך שכרך והלוה מעותי ברבית מותר אבל אסור מפני\n  מראית העין מעות של ישראל מופקדות אצל העובד כוכבים מותר להלוותן ברבית\n  ושל עובד כוכבים המופקדות אצל ישראל אסור להלוותן ברבית זה הכלל כל\n  שבאחריות ישראל אסור כל שבאחריות עובד כוכבים מותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this same issue apply when you own a share in a company? As @Danny mentioned, The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (65:28) takes a machmir stance on a similar issue, but most poskim find some kula.</p>\n\n<p><strong>limited liability leniency</strong>\nAs discussed in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=BnFaZE-Q1JMC&lpg=PA185&ots=ks1HoMwW1q&dq=corporation%20and%20halacha&pg=PA184#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halacha and Contemporary Society</a> and in @Shalom's answer, some poskim say that since an investment in a corporation is of \"limited liability\" (i.e one cannot be personally responsible for any damages or debts), the prohibition of ribbis does not apply. They bring a proof from the Gemara in  גיטין דף ל עמוד א:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר: המלוה מעות את הכהן ואת הלוי ואת העני להיותמפריש עליהן מחלקן -\n  מפריש עליהן בחזקת שהן קיימין, ופוסק עמהן כשער הזול ואין בו משום רבית,\n  ואין שביעית משמטתו, ואם בא לחזור - אינו חוזר; נתייאשו הבעלים - אין\n  מפריש עליהם, לפי שאין מפרישין על האבוד. אמר מר: פוסק עמהם כשער הזול.\n  פשיטא!הא קא משמע לן, אף על פי שלא פסק, כמי שפסק דמי. ואין בו משום\n  רבית. מאי טעמא? כיון דכי לית ליה לא יהיב ליה, כי אית ליה נמי אין בו\n  משום רבית.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The involves granting a loan to a Levi or Kohein and agreeing to collect from ma'aser instead of him repaying the loan. Even though the prices can change, it is assumed (or you agree) to \"collect\" at a set price. This would normally be ribbis derabanan, (since by paying in advance you might benefit), but the gemara says its OK here \"כיון דכי לית ליה לא יהיב ליה\" which (according to Rashi, I think) means that if the farmer's whole crop is ruined he won't need to take ma'aser and the levi or kohein won't need to repay the debt at all. Since there's no guaranteed principle, it seems Ribbis doesn't apply. This could perhaps be extended to a corporation, since if the whole corp. goes bankrupt, one cannot collect debt from the shareholders. Though there could be some differences, and it's a bit of a leap from a derbanan to full-fledged ribbis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>you don't own nothin'</strong>\nR' Moshe Feinstein (End of  אגרות משה אבן העזר חלק א סימן ז) addresses the problem of owning stock in a company that does work on Shabbos. He says that a regular shareholder doesn't really have much knowledge or control over the company so it's not like a partnership where there would be all these issues. You just want the profits (or losses) of the stock and maybe you don't really own anything since really it's  דבר שלא בא לעולם, so you just own it [somewhat?] because of Dina d'Medina.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But shareholders can vote. \n<strong>R'Moshe:</strong> Technically, yes, but does that really matter? The people on top make sure they keep control anyways, and do you really care about your vote? But if you're going to claim a big stake (i.e. become an activist shareholder), then you have a problem... </p>\n\n<p>One would have to examine why stock ownership isn't considered \"real\" and why Dina mDina would only grant quasi-ownership.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Kulas</strong>\nMaybe the \"legal person\" of a corporation is real in halacha too (Romney would be happy). Or maybe breira could somehow help. See <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/stockmarket.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">JLaw.com</a> for some more sources. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mutual Funds, etc.</strong>\nOften one doesn't buy stocks directly, but invests in a mutual fund which buys stocks. This seems like it would be even easier to be meikel, since you don't directly own stock and definitely have no say over anything. I'm not sure who discusses this kula, but it seems that some Kosher funds rely on this (see <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Business/BusinessNews/Article.aspx?id=174933\" rel=\"nofollow\">JPost article</a>). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The base case: the prohibition on interest is only if the principal is guaranteed. A business investment is just that -- I put in $1000 to help you open your pizza store and thus own a 5% stake in it; if your pizza store does well, I could make $500; if your pizza store fails, I could even lose my initial principal of $1000. The same is true for stocks, as I understand it. </p>\n\n<p>The next case (your first question): I buy stocks in Acme Financial, so now they're using my money (among others') to lend to Jews with interest. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Danny had cited says the \"ownership\" of that money depends on who's responsible for it: if the borrower defaults to Acme Financial, does Acme Financial turn around to me and say \"sorry buddy, your money disappeared\"? Or does Acme Financial owe me my money back from some other loan. My understanding is that if Acme Financial's overall value drops, I won't get back all of my investment (and they could tank so badly I could get back none of it); but as soon as I buy stock in them, they take responsibility for that money and seek to maximize overall return to investors as much as possible. I'd therefore read as the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch's case where it's the non-Jew's responsibility and therefore any proceeds are allowable to me. The prohibited case discussed would be where Jews pool their funds, go to a non-Jew and say \"this is our money and if anything happens to it, we lose out; please go invest this\", and the non-Jew turns around and loans to Jews with interest. That's different, if I understand it, from buying stock in a company.</p>\n\n<p>Chametz on Passover is a debate among contemporary authorities. For instance, Rabbi Hershel Shachter feels it is a problem and includes chametz stocks in what he sells to a non-Jew before Passover; Rabbi Mordechai Willig feels it's too far removed from ownership to pose a problem; you can't walk into a General Mills factory with your stock certificate and demand a box of Cheerios!</p>\n\n\n",

Is the answer to this question also the explanation of the <em>midrash</em> that the nation was unable to withstand the first two <em>dibros</em>, which came directly from God to them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rambam (Hil. Yesodei Hatorah ch. 7) describes the prerequisites that a person needs in order to be a navi. To put it in contemporary terms, these are needed so that his mind is \"tuned to the correct frequency\" on which to receive Hashem's word. The average person has not reached this level - they would no more be able to receive such a transmission than a toaster can receive an FM broadcast.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen an idea somewhat related to this (whose source I don't recall), that prophecy requires the receiver's personality to be effaced as much as possible, so that the message doesn't get distorted. As it is, with most prophets (except Moshe, as the Rambam explains there), it does inevitably get filtered through their own subjectivity (this is why the Gemara, Sanhedrin 89a, states that \"no two prophets use the exact same terminology\" - they may both receive the same message from Hashem, but each one perceives it slightly differently), but that has to be kept to a minimum. According to this approach, too, for Hashem to speak to the average person would be a purposeless exercise: the message would be so thoroughly mangled in its passage through his or her mind as to be unrecognizable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Life in this world is meant to challenge Humanity hence I think the reason he does not simply tell them is to give a person Free Choice (Bechirah) if you hear God tell you something it is hard to say no.

Is it one sin of stealing or one Hundred? When you are punished is it the same for the Hundred dollar theif and the one dollar theif?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It would seem to be one single sin of stealing in either case. A possible proof is from Rambam, Hil. Geneivah 3:14, discussing the cases in which a person is or isn't sold as a Jewish slave in payment of his theft. The Rambam writes (translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088870/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the principal of a theft was\n  worth 100 zuz and the thief could be\n  sold for only 50 zuz, he shall be\n  sold, and the remainder of the\n  principal and the double payment is\n  considered a debt incumbent on him\n  until he attains his freedom in the\n  seventh year, acquires the resources\n  and pays.</p>\n  \n  <p>If the thief was worth 101 zuz, he\n  shall not be sold. This is derived\n  from the above verse, which states:\n  \"He shall be sold for his theft.\"\n  Implied is that his entire worth must\n  be included in the money received for\n  his theft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, if the theft of 100 zuz was really 100 separate thefts of one zuz each, then the two cases would be exactly similar: in both of them he's worth more than what he stole. The fact that halachah says he should be sold in the first case indicates that it's considered one unitary theft.</p>\n\n\n",

(The <em>Korban Aharon</em> asks that that's not true: the <em>kohen</em> says it's <em>tame</em>, but it's a <em>nega tahor</em> even before pronounced <em>tame</em> by the <em>kohen</em>. The <em>Tos'fos Yom Tov</em> answers that \"<em>nega</em>\" in the vernacular means a <em>tame</em> one, so he'd be lying to call it that.)</li>\n<li>(his own) Because of <em>al tiftach pe l'satan</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Midrashim</em> quoted by the <em>Tora Sh'lema</em> say that this is the source of \"<em>al tiftach pe l'satan</em>\" [which I guess means that they agree with the <em>Tos'fos Yom Tov</em>'s own answer].</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Matis Blum of Queens, in his \"Torah Lodaas\" weekly <em>d'var-Tora</em> sheet for <em>M'tzora</em> 5771, suggests that according to those who say there never was or will be a house with <em>tzaraas</em>, \"<em>k'nega</em>\" makes sense, as it isn't, in fact, a <em>nega</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ralbag</em> says it's because only the <em>kohen</em> can adjudge it a <em>nega</em>. [This is opaque to me, but perhaps he means the <em>Mizrachi</em>'s teachers' or the <em>Gur Arye</em>'s answer?]</p>\n\n<p><em>Rav Moshe</em> (in <em>Darash Moshe</em>) says it's so as not to say something bad.

(This works, he notes, according to those who hold a homeowner can check a <em>nega</em> on his own home, which he says is a matter of dispute among <em>rishonim</em>.) And if the owner is not a <em>talmid chacham</em> (or if he saw it at night or under other circumstances that don't count) then (a) saying it's a <em>nega</em> is lying and (b) one shouldn't begin talking by saying something bad.</p>\n\n\n",

If his son is underage but old enough to fast (eg., 12 and a half, for the sake of argument), I think the point is that the father ought to attend the Siyyum with his son, in order to obviate the need to fast.

The name מכת בכורות hints at this: it means \"the smiting [accomplished by] the firstborn.\" (According to this approach, I suppose, the deaths of the firstborn five days later, on Pesach night, is subsumed under this.)</p>\n\n<p>Whereas R' Yehudah disagrees. He says that the firstborn did not wage war against the Egyptian government, and that the tenth plague was just that - Hashem killing all of the firstborn. So he uses ב (standing for בכורים) for the last makkah, rather than מ.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Aside from this, there are a number of reasons given for R' Yehudah's acronym. A simple one is just that he was in the habit of doing so in other places too (for example, Menachos 11:4).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>All the Makkoth could be called \"Makkath <em>_</em>\".  It could just as easily be called \"Bechoroth\" as \"Makkath Bechoroth\".  The ב fits as well as all the others.  The fact that it is referred to in the Haggadah may just be a reflection of the common way it is referred to in the literature and by the general public.  That, in turn, could be a reflection of people's (and I include HaZa\"L in that) reluctance to just refer to it as \"Death of the First Borns\" or merely \"First Borns\" without first appending the title \"Plague of __\" beforehand to distinguish that they are referring to a very specific incident that only occurred at one time and only in Egypt to the Egyptians at that time as a matter of punishment/Middah KeNegged Middah.  </p>\n\n<p>The fact that the Siman leaves out the Mem is probably because he's trying to shorten it; if he shortened it to Mem-Beith it would defeat the purpose.  Why not just Mem (without the Beith, as suggested in the original question) could be as I mentioned above, that it's too generic; or see my question below - I wonder if the newly formed words from the Simanim meant something.</p>\n\n<p>The real question is why the Simanim?  What do they mean, and why are they more memorable than just the full names of the plagues (assuming the point was to make it easier to remember them)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chometz Gezel Akum\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Pesachim (ה:‏) says if you are holding Chometz for a gentile and Pesach comes you have to burn it. How is it possible to say that: it is Gezel Akum and even if you pay him back you are still stealing the actual item?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>True, but at this point the item deposited with you is going to cause you harm (because you'll be violating the mitzvos of בל יראה ובל ימצא). So, logically, you should be allowed to get rid of it.</p>\n\n<p>A possibly analogous case is in Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 292:8, where a person who is holding money or valuables for someone else is threatened by thieves, and he gives them the deposit in order to save himself. The rule there is that if he's not particularly wealthy (אינו אמוד), then we assume that the thieves were attracted by the rumor that he's got something valuable in his house, and then he is indeed exempt from having to repay the owner - because the deposit itself is what caused all the trouble in the first place. (Here, in the case of the chametz, he is indeed liable to the gentile to replace it - otherwise it would be של אחרים and he wouldn't have to get rid of it anyway - but that's because the Jew accepted this responsibility along with the chametz, and it is also the law of the land that he is so responsible - see <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/440/9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Harav 440:9</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

Depending on how you translate the items listed in the Mishna and Gemara there, they may all be members of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteraceae\" rel=\"nofollow\">composite/lettuce/daisy family.</a> (The one that stands out like a sore thumb is horseradish, which Rabbi Hershel Welcher admitted does not fit according to modern-day analysis of the Gemara; he uses mostly romaine, with a touch of horseradish for nostalgia's sake. The Talmudic \"tamcha\" came to mean \"horseradish\" in Hebrew by the 1500s, but it's far less than clear that's what the Talmud was referring to.) So there was likely a tradition \"anything in this family with these properties.\" It may really have been one tradition, not five separate ones.</p>\n\n<p>B. See <a href=\"http://hp.download.yutorah.org/2011/1053/755205/Using%20the%20principle%20of%20Darchei%20No%27am%20in%20halacha.MP3\" rel=\"nofollow\">this mp3 from Rabbi Aharon Kahn</a>. The Gemara talks about how to identify the Four Species (lulav etc.); once it's narrowed it down to one or two, it disqualifies one of them as it has sharp barbs that would injure your hand when holding it; if there are two equally reasonable interpretations, we assume, based on the principle of \"the Torah's ways are pleasant\", that it's the less-painful one. Now one could look at that whole Gemara and ask to what degree Chazal are simply validating their tradition of the identity of the Four Species, or if this is the derivation. I don't know the subject well; but it may be related to the question of how halachic \"derashot\" work, on which some Gaonim held it's entirely tradition, and Rambam held it's entirely derivation. Some ask that a barbed plant was not disqualified from the marror list; Chasam Sofer answers brilliantly that you have a choice of bitter herbs. If the Torah is obligating you to take a <em>kapot temarim</em>, it stands the reason the Torah isn't demanding you tear your skin (unless we're told otherwise). But if the Torah says \"eat any of these plants; most of them are not scratchy\", and you want to choose to make yourself miserable and do the scratchy one? That's your prerogative!  </p>\n\n\n",

Secondly, you have no idea what they're putting in those cigarettes so you shouldn't use them on Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>As far as <em>davar hashaveh lechol nefesh</em>: the Talmud says you can cook fresh food on YomTov because freshly-cooked food is something universally appreciated. The Talmud then says that <em>mugmar</em>, some form of post-meal incense, is an acquired taste of the upper-class and not something universally appreciated; it doesn't pass the bar and therefore can't be done on YomTov.</p>\n\n<p>I'd seen an article on the question of smoking a few years back, I believe in <em>J.

One argument was: \"any smoker would tell you it's <em>shaveh l'chol nefesh</em>\", which to me is an addict's reasoning if I've ever heard any. Another was: \"smoking helps you digest your food better, and good digestion is universally appreciated\" -- again, today we know it doesn't help you digest your food better (though if you're addicted and it calms you down, the calmness may aid your digestion; but it's certainly no better than the Talmud's case of <em>mugmar</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hershel Schachter recalled giving a shiur about yomtov and someone asked him about smoking cigars, he said it was prohibited based on the above.

Although he notes that it could be argued that this is not shaveh l'khol nefesh since people avoid smoking due to health concerns, he concludes that it is difficult to prohibit given its ubiquity. Furthermore, one could argue that in the past not everyone smoked yet it <em>was</em> considered \"shaveh lakol\" so the halakha ought to stay the same even though now there is an element of danger. He also notes that since millions of people smoke perhaps this alone renders it \"shaveh lakol\".

Simply הרבה, meaning many. </p>\n\n<p>Another closely related issue which you have dismissed as unrelated is seemingly intrinsically connected. The health factor plays a big role here. </p>\n\n<p>See maseches Ksuvos 7a. This is a quote mid sugya: אלא מעתה מותר לעשות מוגמר ביו''ט דמתוך שהותרה הבערה לצורך הותרה נמי שלא לצורך אמר ליה עליך אמר קרא {שמות יב-טז} אך אשר יאכל לכל נפש דבר השוה לכל נפש אמר ליה רב אחא בריה דרבא לרב אשי אלא מעתה נזדמן לו צבי ביו''ט הואיל ואינו שוה לכל נפש ה''נ דאסור למשחטיה אמר ליה אנא דבר הצורך לכל נפש קאמינא צבי צריך לכל נפש הוא. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains:\n לצורך. אוכל נפש כגון שחיטה: מוגמר. בשמים על האש לגמר את הכלים ואת הבגדים: עליך אמר קרא לכל נפש דבר השוה לכל נפש. מותר ובעילה שוה לכל אבל מוגמר אינו אלא למפונקים:</p>\n\n<p>We see the close connection between שוה לכל נפש and צריך לכל נפש, with צריך being the more accurate criteria, even though most codified halachic works continued to use the phrase שוה לכל נפש. </p>\n\n<p>A useful, normal act is allowed. Something which is not normally useful is not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>This is important because many of the early rulings to be lenient to smoke on Yom Tov focused on the laxative effect of smoking. (This was not meant to be viewed as a רפואה, this was meant to be viewed as a צורך לכל, שוה לכל).\nNowadays, the knowledge of the health risk serves to dismiss any argument that smoking is  a צריך לכל/ שוה לכל being that there is no צריך for it. </p>\n\n<p>This is the way the argument of Reb Elyashiv, and possibly Reb Shlomo Zalman acc to some quotes, was explained to me. The basic point is the fact that something is so obviously unhealthy means it is in no way a צריך.</p>\n\n<p>(And just to preempt any argument, the difference between the health risks between smoking and red meat and wine is quite obvious.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "very different Pesach cleaning practices",
    "content": "# very different Pesach cleaning practices\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have always been perplexed by the vast variation of Pesach cleaning practices.  On the one hand I have seen notes of shiurim by respected rabbis who say that virtually the only real work to be done is to prepare the kitchen / pantry for Pesach... and even in the kitchen, only what you are going to actually use for food during Pesach (e.g. if the oven will not be used, it need not be cleaned at all).  As for the rest of the house, if you want to close off a room for Pesach, you don't need to clean it at all and if you do want to use the room, you just need to make sure there are no large pieces of chometz in there and sweep the floor.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand there are people that spend the whole day scrubbing an oven they are not going to use for Pesach, spend multiple hours cleaning each bedroom, paint the walls in the kitchen and dining room, spend hours scrubbing chairs and tables, etc.</p>\n\n<p>To me, these seem like almost different religions.  How do I reconcile this?</p>\n\n<p>Related question:  Is it true that the first (i.e. easy) scenario is based on what is written in the halacha, and the second (i.e. very hard) is based on custom?</p>\n\n<p>And if so (that the second is custom), couldn't it be considered a sin, since you are thereby taking away so much time that could be used for doing things that are really mitzvos and also the fact that you are implying to others (including your children) that this is the halacha, when in fact it is not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is not just \"spring cleaning\". See Rosh Pesachim (3:2), brought in Tur/Sh\"A (OC:442)</p>\n\n<p>כתב זקיני רבינו אב\"ן ז\"ל בחיבורו ומה שנהגו לגרר הכותלים והכסאות שהגיע בהן חמץ קודם הפסח מצאתי לו סמך בירושלמי </p>\n\n<p>So it isn't an obligation, but \"Jews are holy\" (R' Yerucham 5:5) and rid the house of all traces of chametz before Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it rises to the level of obligation, as when there's enough chametz in a single utensil that if combined would amount to a kezayis. Thus the toasters and similar must be cleaned or sold.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Halachically you can do the minimum and be 100% Kosher L'Pesach. However the Arizal said that whoever is careful from even a minimal amount of Chometz over Pesach is promised that he will not sin all year. </p>\n\n<p>In addition Pesach is a Yom Tov of Mesora - where we give over to the next generation the fact that Hashem took us out of Mitzrayim and how Hashem watches over every little thing that goes on. Many people do more than necessary as this is what my parents did.</p>\n\n\n",

A good example of this is quinoa.

Based on the tradition of kitynot, there is no way marijuana would be defined as kitnyot.

(In other words, is there a prohibition on activating the chemical reaction which produces the light in a glow stick?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I hope that this is more helpful.</p>\n\n<p>I am a rabbi in Birmingham.  When we have tornadoes which knock out power we recommend people use light sticks.  There is no heat generated, the light is a simple chemical reaction.  breaking the inner glass is not mekalkel as what you are doing is not destructive it is in fact constructive.  Think of cutting a cucumber for salad...yeah you are breaking something but it is for a constructive purpose so it is not mekalkel.</p>\n\n<p>Not every cutting act or breaking act is forbidden. It must fit into a category of melakha. The three categories of cutting are Gozez and Kore'a and mekhatech. </p>\n\n<p>Gozez requires that the cutting be done inorder to improve the item that it is being cut off from the av melakha only applies in animals and people but the toladot apply globally (bekhorot 24b, tosafot bekhorot 25a, Eglei Tal Melekhet Gozez). This is shearing a sheep or getting a hair cut.</p>\n\n<p>Koreya: requires that the tearing be done inorder to sew back.  This means that if you have two pieces of cloth that are coming apart you may not separate them so that you can resew them.  This melakha only applies to soft bendable materials (cloth etc.) and not to things like metal or wood or glass (minhat chinuch shabbat 24 and elsewhere I cant remember or find at the moment) and though not the main stream view may pasken that it only applies to woven materials.</p>\n\n<p>Mekhatekh, this only applies when cutting something to a specific size or shape (rambam 11, chayei adam)</p>\n\n<p>The category of breaking is only applicable if you in the process do a melakha.  Or if it is destroying inorder to build however, if there is no constructive nature to the act there is no issur (maybe baal tashchit though it wouldnt apply in this case) The gemara posits that even if a man is breaking something inorder to show his anger in his household that may not be completely non-constructive.</p>\n\n<p>All this being said, I dont let my children play with the light sticks on shabbat and we don't take them out unless there is a power outage.  I dont think that it would be assur for them to do so but I dont think that it is shabbostik (it is not in the spirit of shabbat).  In the case that you really need them for light it is certainly better than any alternative such as a flashlight.  So in summary I think that it is permitted but I think that it lessens the shabbat experience (except for when it doesn't)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Aside from the chemical reaction (about which I don't know whether that would be permissible on Shabbos), there is also the fact that in activating it you're breaking the inner glass tube. At the very least, if we consider this מקלקל (a destructive act), then I would think it would be prohibited Rabbinically.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's discussed by Rabbi Mordechai Torczyner, along with the chemical reaction causing self-heating meals, <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/740807/Torczyner,_Rabbi_Mordechai\" rel=\"nofollow\">in this mp3</a>. (Also see his <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/_materials/sheetsfor1021.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">source sheet</a>.) It's been discussed in some Hebrew-language halacha journals recently.</p>\n\n<p>It appears to be at most rabbinically prohibited, at least at first glance.</p>\n\n\n",

If you have any comments or suggestions on the purchase, please let me know.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I bought and used the haggadah for my second seder (which I did not lead) and can now answer my question of a week ago.</p>\n\n<h2>General Look</h2>\n\n<p>It has a dual cover: the left side in English and leading to the English discussion of the haggadah and the right side in Hebrew leading straight into the Hebrew haggadah. One possible downside is that on the English side of the cover, there is an illustration depicting two woman cooking. They are exposing some décolletage and is not exactly at an Orthodox level of tznius nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>The book has a dust jacket, which is useful for holding your place. There are about 150 pages of English describing the haggadah, discussing its illustrations, and translating it. This adds some heft to the haggadah, but also, in my opinion, helps it stay open easier. The haggadah itself is reproduced in full color and looks very nice.</p>\n\n<h2>Readability</h2>\n\n<p>There are nekudos and generally, I had no problem reading the words written. There a many abbreviations. For example, באיאמה stood for the entire beginning of a brachah. There were some less obvious abbreviations that a novice would certainly not know unless listening to somebody else reciting the Haggadah text.</p>\n\n<h2>Differences from a Standard Haggadah</h2>\n\n<p>I was most surprised to see that there were the usual instructions in Hebrew on what do in certain places (e.g., \"say in a loud voice,\" \"fill cups,\" etc.). There was even an Eruv Chatzeiros text at the back.</p>\n\n<p>The text of Birchas HaMazon was not included, nor was the Blessing after Wine. The haggadah ended with Adir Hu. Other than this, there were a few, very slight changes from the leader's text which I do not recall.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I liked using this haggadah. It was pleasant to look at and, as Isaac Moses pointed out, my using a haggadah that is more than 530 years old (older than many current religions) does demonstrate the longevity of our tradition.</p>\n\n<p>I do not think this is a good haggadah for those who are not very familiar with the Seder or for anyone who is leading a seder. The differences will be most notable in these situations and may harm your seder experience.</p>\n\n\n",

(Present-day Chabad custom is to compromise and use lettuce <em>and</em> horseradish for both.) The reason for calling the stuff for koreich \"chazeres,\" he says, is to make it clear that it needn't be the actual species called \"maror\" (wormwood).</p>\n\n<p>In his commentary on the Haggadah, the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=10502&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow\">cites</a> this, but argues that if that's the reason, then the term \"chazeres\" should have been used for both items on the Seder plate.

However, the Rambam wanted to give <em>an</em> explanation of sacrifices.

If the Law depended on the\n  varying conditions of man, it would be imperfect in its totality, each\n  precept being left indefinite. For this reason it would not be right\n  to make the fundamental principles of the Law dependent on a certain\n  time or a certain place; on the contrary, the statutes and the\n  judgments must be definite, unconditional and general, in accordance\n  with the divine words: \"As for the congregation, one ordinance shall\n  be for you and for the stranger\" (Num. xv. 15); they are intended, as\n  has been stated before, for all persons and for all times.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Friedlander translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, once a law is given it would be an imperfection for it to stop applying under changing circumstances.

Man, like animal, is a physical organism of flesh and blood. Both are driven by their lusts and emotions; all that separates man from animal is his intellect. When a person sins because he allows his desires to get the better of his intellect, he puts himself on equal footing with the animal. It is necessary to impress upon such a person the futility of physical existence which is not led by the mind's rational judgment. This is accomplished by having him offer a sacrifice.</p>\n<p>The sinner brings a body of flesh and blood, like his own, to the Mikdash. There, he slaughters it and burns it on the altar -- much as he allowed his own body to be \"burned\" by the fire of desire (Rabeinu Bachye 1:9). The blood is sprinkled on the altar and the intestines and fats (the vehicles of desire) are burned, to demonstrate \"there, but for the grace of G-d, go I\" (Ramban 1:8). It is thus vividly portrayed to him that a body without a mind is valueless (Chinuch, Mitzvah #95). The meat of the sacrifice provides sustenance for the Kohanim, educators of the people and purveyors of the Torah (Devarim 33:10), who then pray for the complete atonement of the sinner (Ramban).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is also an idea, found in the Zohar and later kabbalistic and chassidic literature, that each of the major types of animal life \"evolves\" spiritually from the corresponding \"face\" of the Chayos Hakodesh (a type of angel described in Ezekiel ch. 1 passim). The Chayos are described as having four \"faces\": a lion, a bull, an eagle, and a human being. The lion's face, then, is the spiritual source of all wild animals, the bull's face of all domesticated ones, and the eagle's face of all birds.</p>\n\n<p>When we offer a sacrifice, the physical substance of the animal or bird goes up in smoke. This represents how it is spiritually elevated and goes to \"feed\" the corresponding \"face\" of the Chayos, thus bringing down more Divine largess to that category of creature (and thereby to us, who depend on them for food and other uses).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beyondbt.com/2011/03/11/rambam-and-ramban-on-the-purpose-of-korbonos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.beyondbt.com/2011/03/11/rambam-and-ramban-on-the-purpose-of-korbonos/</a></p>\n\n<p>Rambam - In order to fight our urge for Avoda Zarah</p>\n\n<p>Ramban - To bring one closer to Hashem</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# why half-believe the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(I'm not sure this is on-topic, and feel free to close it if it's not, of course.)</p>\n\n<p>I understand some who study the Bible claim natural reasons for things we recognize as miracles, from the plagues of the Exodus to the splitting of the sea to the stopping of the sun at <em>Giv'on</em> to the writing on the wall in <em>Daniyel</em>. Why? If you believe the Torah's true, then you believe these things are miracles, and if you don't, then why believe they happened at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Some of it may indeed be based on the attempt to claim that (G-d forbid) the Torah is not true at all.</p>\n\n<p>The early Bible critics did exactly that - nearly everything described in Tanach was dismissed as a fable. But then, when archeology began to turn up evidence that meshes with the Torah narratives, that approach became untenable.</p>\n\n<p>So the next logical thing for these types was to claim, \"Well, okay, the Hebrew scribes were recording something that actually occurred more-or-less as they say - but they were ignorant, primitive people who didn't understand Science as we do, and so they attributed these events to miracles rather than to Nature.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Which isn't to say, though, that there can't be legitimate reasons for it too, as in the other answers.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>At least some people who \"half-believe\" the torah are in transition.  Not everybody is a rock-solid believer from birth; for the rest of us, there will be some period during which you are trying to figure out what torah you accept from scientific validation (\"yeah, it would be possible for the Sea of Reeds to do that\"), what you accept because of publicity (\"could 2 million witnesses at Sinai be wrong?\"), and what you come to accept through a deeper recognition of God's truth.  People aren't static, and today's half-believers could be tomorrow's believers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Let me float something out there.  In some sense one who pursues an explanation for the events in the Torah through natural causes is not totally incorrect.  The Torah does not preclude the events from being brought about through the laws of nature.  The Torah is just asserting that Hashem initiated the phenomena.  Hashem either initiated the event through pre-programming it into the laws of nature (as Chazal assert) or through a breach in the normative patterns of nature (as Rambam asserts). Either way Hashem is manipulating nature to bring about the result.  For example the splitting of the sea was a result of strong winds (see description in the Chumash).  The plague of the first born does deviate from this pattern.  It is expressed as being brought about by Hashem directly, through no agent.  Which makes sense, because there is no natural way to explain the selection process.<br>\nYou see even by the Jews request for Meat, Mosses was uncertain that Hashem would bring it about.  In Bamidbar, Chapter 11, Verse 13 \"Where will I get meat to give this entire people...?\"  and in Verse 23 Hashem responds \"Is the hand of Hashem limited?...\"\nWhy would Moshe doubt whether Hashem could bring it about.  Didn't he just see all the Miracles done in Egypt?  I don't know the particular issue Moshe was grappling with, but Moshe has some idea of how Hashem brings about Miracles.  Hashem doesn't just make meat appear out of thin air onto each persons plate.  It is through some manipulation of nature that it is brought about. In this case it was a strong wind that brought the meat from the sea to the Bnai Yisroel.  </p>\n\n<p>My main point being, is that even if you are able to show through natural scientific causes each of the phenomena described in the Torah, it would not take away from the נס aspect, which is that Hashem is the creator and he can and does manipulate nature to bring about results that are beneficial for mankind. The fact that the sea split exactly at that time that was beneficial for the Bnei Yisroel and closed exactly the right time to eliminate the Egyptians as predicted is what is so \"miraculous\".  </p>\n\n<p>Just some food for thought.</p>\n\n\n",

But on the other hand, the people involved are warriors, and thus are surely males, so I can understand גבר as a replacement. My <strong>inclination</strong> is that Onkelos selected only one of these, but some text emended all of these, and someone wrote אנש as a marginal gloss once, to indicate the general divergence, which was then misinterpreted to mean a replacement of only one of these.

Many sefardim follow the Kaf Ha'Chaim that it is a measure of weight.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes62-yr.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes62-yr.htm</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...As the Maggid Mishneh explains, the Rambam here establishes that these measurements are determined by volume, not weight, a principle that seems to emerge as well from the mishnayot (Keilim 17:6 and elsewhere) and many other sources. This is also the view of the Mishna Berura (486:3). However, the Kaf Ha-chayim (168:46) observes that common practice was to calculate according to weight, seemingly against the straightforward reading of all the poskim. We may perhaps attribute this practice to the difficulty involved in constantly measuring volume.</p>\n<p>Today, Ashkenazim calculate volume, in accordance with the aforementioned ruling of the Mishna Berura, and this is also the oft-cited view of Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. The Sefardic authorities dispute the issue: Rav Ovadya Yosef (Yechaveh Da'at 1:16) writes that the weight measurement should be used, while Rav Shalom Messas (Tevu'ot Shemesh) maintains that we determine measurements based on volume.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You are correct.

It must be well understood that the term \"upon it\" is employed by me in harmony with this metaphor. \"Angels of God\" who were going up represent the prophets. That the term \"angel\" was applied to prophets may clearly be seen in the following passages: \"He sent an angel\" (Num. xx. 16); \"And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim\" (Judges ii. 1). How suggestive, too, is the expression \"ascending and descending on it\"! The ascent is mentioned before the descent, inasmuch as the \"ascending\" and arriving at a certain height of the ladder precedes the \"descending,\" i.e., the application of the knowledge acquired in the ascent for the training and instruction of mankind. This application is termed \"descent,\" in accordance with our explanation of the term yarad (chapter x.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is similar to one of the themes of the cave, wherein the philosopher escapes from the cave and acquires knowledge and then must return to the cave to impart his knowledge to the other prisoners.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not sure why no one mentioned this yet, but the Rambam uses imagery very similar to the Platonic cave at the very beginning of his <em>Guide</em> (Introduction, p. 7-8, Pines edition), when discussing the degrees of wisdom that separate people:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should not think that these great <em>secrets</em> are fully and completely known to anyone among us. They are not. But sometimes truth flashes out to us so that we think that it is  day, and then matter and habit in their various  forms conceal it so that we find  ourselves again in an obscure night, almost as we were at first. <strong>We are like someone in a very dark night over whom lightning flashes time and time again. Among us there is one for whom the lightning flashes time and time again, so that he is  always, as it were, in unceasing light.</strong> Thus night appears to him as day. That is the degree of the great one among the prophets, to whom it was said: <em>But as for thee,  stand thou  here by Me</em>, and of whom it was said: <em>that  the skin of his face sent forth beams, and so on</em>. Among them there is one to whom the lightning flashes only once in the whole of his night; that is the rank of those of whom it is said: <em>they prophesied,  but they did so no more</em>. There are others between whose lightning flashes there are greater or shorter intervals. Thereafter comes he who does not attain a degree in which his darkness is illumined by any lightning flash. <strong>It is illumined, however, by a  polished body or something of that kind, stones or something else that give light in the darkness of the night. And even this small light that shines over us is not always there, but flashes and is hidden again</strong>, as if it were the <em>flaming sword which turned every way</em>. It is in accord with these  states that the degrees of the perfect  vary. As for those who never even once see a  light, but grope about in their night, of them it is said: <em>They know  not, neither do they understand</em>; <em>They go  about in darkness</em>. The truth, in spite of the strength of its  manifestation,  is entirely hidden from them, as is  said of them: <em>And now  men see not the light  which is bright in the skies</em>. They are the vulgar among the people. There is then no  occasion to mention them here in this Treatise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like the distinctions of light in Plato's allegory (those enchained who only see shadows off the fire vs. the escapee who eventually sees the light of the sun), we have here distinctions of people. Instead of a cave, we are all in the darkness of night. Like Plato, the Rambam sets the philosopher at the rarest, loftiest level, the one who can see the kind of light that emanates from lightning (i.e., knows truth, understands ultimate reality). Most of us, however, either see no light, or, in rare intervals, only the kind of light displaced by degree (refracted from stones).</p>\n\n\n",

As a matter of fact, only the first 2 stanzas and the last stanza talk about Shabbos.The stanza of (אֶחָד בְּדִבּוּר וְזָכוֹר שָׁמוֹר) talks about Shabbos. (וְנֵלְֿכָה לְכוּ שַׁבָּת לִקְרַאת) talks about Shabbos, so we say them. The next stanzas talk about the Churban Beis Hamikdash and a desire for Mashiach to come. \nFor example (מְלוּכָה עִיר מֶֽלֶךְ מִקְדַּשׁ) speaks about, you dwelled long enough in the valley of weeping. In other words we are talking about the fact that we want Mashiach to come. \n(קֽוּמִי מֵעָפָר יהִתְנַעֲרִ), Arise get up from your dust which is also talking about the desire of Klal Yisrael to come to its redemption (גְּאָלָהּ נַפְשִׁי אֶל קָרְבָה הַלַּחְמִי בֵּית יִשַׁי בֶּן יַד עַל). So too (הִתְעוֹרְֿרִי הִתְעוֹרְֿרִי) and (תֵבֽוֹשִׁי לאֹ) and \n(ךְשׁאֹסָֽיִ מְשִׁסָּהלִ וְהָיוּ). All of these talk about the Churban. Since they talk about a desire for the Geulah to come after the Churban so then when it is Yom Tov, a day of great Simcha we skip them. We say (וּשְׂמאֹל יָמִין) because that stanza envisions Mashiach coming and it doesn’t talk about the Tzaros of the Shibbud. However, the 5 that we do skip talk about the difficulties and therefore it is appropriate that we skip them on Yom Tov and that is the reason that we skip them. \nYou may ask, indeed what is it doing here in (דוֹדִי לְכָה) in the first place? What are stanzas that talk about Churban and Geulah doing in (דוֹדִי לְכָה)? The answer to that is (דוֹדִי לְכָה) was written by the Mikubalim in Tzfas who came to Tzfas after the expulsion in Spain and they focused a lot on the hope and prayer that the expulsion from Spain would lead to Mashiach coming. When they sang (דוֹדִי לְכָה), you have all heard of the idea that they used to go out into the fields and greet Shabbos, greet the setting sun in the mountain tops which heralded the arrival of Shabbos. That greeting of Shabbos Malkisa was a M’ain of Mashiach’s times called the true Geulah. The real time of Yom Shekulo Shabbos was a day of a complete Shabbos. Therefore as they sang a song wishing and hoping for Mashiach to come, they mixed that with the song in which they mentioned their desire for the Kallah of Shabbos to arrive and the Tefilla that Mashiach would come. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://matzav.com/audio-rav-reisman-on-acharon-shel-pesach\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://matzav.com/audio-rav-reisman-on-acharon-shel-pesach</a></p>\n\n\n",

Soloveitchik, zt\"l,\n  heard a reason why we do not do so\n  from the Kovno Rav [see Devar\n  Avraham]: If a person counts twice due\n  to doubt, i.e., stating that it is\n  either the fourth day of the Omer or\n  the fifth day of the Omer, he will not\n  have fulfilled his mitzva at all\n  because a doubtful count is not\n  considered a count. Our Sages stated\n  in the first perek of Bava Metzia\n  regarding ma'aser behema that it must\n  be the tenth of every ten animals, and\n  not a doubtful tenth.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>In conclusion, now that we have an\n  established calendar and our\n  celebration of two days Yom Tov is\n  only due to the minhag of our fathers,\n  as noted in the beginning of Tractate\n  Beitza, we count consecutive numbers\n  each night, starting from the second\n  night of Pesach until we have counted\n  seven complete weeks - to Shavuot</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/ask-the-rabbi/q-a-sefirat-haomer-when-to-start-counting-part-iii/2014/04/14/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q & A: Sefirat HaOmer – When To Start Counting (Part III)</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>Taame Haminhagim</em> 577 answers (in my own loose translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… because we shouldn't be so strict about it, since it's nothing but a remembrance to what was done when we had the <em>bes hamikdash</em>.</p>\n<p>Another [reason] is that if we count one day ahead then we'll reach number 49 on <em>Shavuos</em>, which we'll therefore come to treat lightly.

Moshe literally \"leaned\" on Yehoshua (and made him a link in the tradition of Sinai). Sometime Following the destruction of the Second Temple, semichah was lost (at  least until the 4th or 5th centuries CE, and maybe even continued on a small scale until the time of the Ramban - 11th century CE - see <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/hatkufa/mishpat2-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for more). </p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of attempts over the past few hundred years to revive the classic semichah, based on a ruling by Rambam (Hilchot Sanhedrin 4:11). None of them have been particularly successful. See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semikhah#The_decline_of_classical_semikhah\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia article</a> for more info. </p>\n\n<p>Semichah today is not the classical semichah. Rather, it is a היתר הוראה - a permission to pasken (decide halachic questions). In general, one is forbidden to pasken in the presence of one's teacher (or maybe even at all) unless the teacher gives them permission to do so. The semichah today does this. The title \"Rabbi\" is normally given to people who have received semichah.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding who should pasken - it is up to the individual. Not everyone who has received semichah from some institution is knowledgeable enough or qualified to do so in some or all areas. Additionally, there are many resources today that one can look to answers that have been given in the past for halachic questions (Mishnah Berurah, Aruch haShulchan, lots of halacha sefarim) - looking up the answer to a question in one of these sources may not qualify as a new pesak (halachic decision) in the way that same way that guidance on how to act in a specific situation would.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>P'sak is not only knowledge, but the ability make appropriate applications (m'dame milsa l'milsa).</p>\n\n<p>A relative of my wife was tested by a Rav in Europe for many days on 60 blatt gemara, Rashi and Tosfos*.  At the end he asked him a mere 3 questions straight from a mechaber and gave him a letter.  His reasoning:  You can teach Yoreh Deah to a guy off the street, but to be a posek you have to be a lamdan.</p>\n\n<p>This may also include apprenticeship (shimush)</p>\n\n<p>*In Europe and early America, one would get semicha by being tested by Rabbonim, not a yeshiva masmich.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Many learn \"smicha\" now a days and will receive a piece of paper (Yoreh Yoreh or a Heter Horah) after the finishing of their limud with an oral and sometimes written test. The standard is to learn at least Hilchos Melicha, Baser B'Chalav, and Taarovos. Others will go \"beyond\" and learn also Hilchos Shabbos and Niddah. To be a Rov l'maseh and pasken shailos (someone who perhaps is only a rov without a shul, or someone who is a rov and also leads a community/kehillah/etc) would need to be able to deal with all types of shailos that spread throughout all of Orach Chaim Yoreh Deah. So it's a little bit interesting that this basic limud has become enough to at least be recognized as a \"posek\". Once upon a time one needed to take a test on all of Yoreh Deah Chelek Alef (including Shechita and Treifos) as this was then needed for a Rov to know (now a days it's more those that work in the field of shechita however I think even the big Rabbonim not directly involved still know these halachos well (like everything else.) What I've seen on many peoples \"smichas\" it says \"Yoreh Yoreh ... However he can't be a rov until he gets shimush\" ... It'll vary from person to person how much shimush one needs but in that time when making shimush to learn other halachos in Yoreh Deah and Orach Chaim as well as reading many teshuva seforim would help prepare a person more to pasken shailos l'maseh.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm interested in understanding Orthodoxy, which I understand isn't even one branch, but a bunch of branches.  </p>\n\n<p>(Update: if \"branch\" is an incorrect word, please understand that I mean only, groups which could be held distinct in some way, from the rest of Orthodox Judaism.)</p>\n\n<p>What is a good book that helps with understanding Orthodox Judaism, as it exists today and is practiced, it's history and ideas and most of all, the underlying principles or forms, or ideas, which make it itself. A good book for me would answer these questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What do the authorities within Orthodox judaism say about Orthodox Judaism. How do they define it?</li>\n<li>What is the daily life of those comitted to the practices of Orthodoxy look like, including the practice of \"Shabbat/\"Shabbos\"</li>\n<li>Introducing the the study of Torah, Tanakh, and Talmud, as it is understood by Orthodox authorities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I realize that all of the above are worthy of their own books. But imagine, you simply want somewhere to start. is there a good book on what Orthodox judaism is, that addresses at least a little bit of those subject areas, that would be readable by someone with zero knowledge of Hebrew?</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing I want to know is that the view in the book is presented by those who themselves hold the views they are describing. That is, I am not looking for an external, or academic view.

    "content": "# Help with Tosfot \"v'HaAmar R. Yochanan\" on Brachot 5b\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gmara on Brachot 5b quotes R. Yochanon:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>R. Yochanan</strong> says: Leprosy and children are not <strong>chastisements of\n  love</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gmara later questions this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But is children not a\n  chastisement of love? How is this to\n  be understood? Shall I say that <strong>he had\n  children and they died</strong>? Did not <strong>R.\n  Yochanan</strong> himself say: This is the bone\n  of my tenth son?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi offers an explanation to the Gmara's question, i.e. to show how R. Yochanan is contradicting himself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... and a great man like R. Yochanan \n  did not receive chastisements <strong>NOT</strong>\n  of love</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, R. Yochanan was showing a bone of his tenth dead son. If he, the great R. Yochanon, suffered the loss of children then the loss of children, <em>r\"l</em>, although a chastisement, <strong>IS</strong> of love. This is because suffering of great men is only out of love. Well if R. Yochanon said above that the loss of children is <strong>NOT</strong> a chastisement of love we then have a contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfot are not comfortable with Rashi's explanation of the Gmara. This is because the Gmara goes on to solve the contradicting statements by differentiating between two situations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Never having any sons -- not of love.</li>\n<li>The loss of sons -- of love.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The one which R. Yochanon suffered from, the loss of sons, <strong>IS</strong> of love. The other, which R. Yochanon did not suffer from, never having sons, is <strong>NOT</strong> of love. </p>\n\n<p>If Rashi is correct that any category of suffering that was experienced by a great man like R. Yochanon is automatically labeled \"chastisements of love\" how then could \"never having sons\" <strong>NOT</strong> be a chastisement of love, since we have seen many great great men who had not children at all.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfot's question is clear to me. So is the answer given at the end. What is not clear is the following quick intermediate question and answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And if because of daughters? R. Yochanon\n  also had daughters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If some one could help me understand this part of the Tosfot I would be very grateful. (small hint: the Haghot HaBach doesn't seem to help much).</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if mi.yodeya.com has been used for this kind of learning in the past, I thought I'd give it a try ...</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much to Alex for pointing me to the Tzalach. This helped sharpen my difficulty with the Tosfot. If I understand the Tzlach the <em>mahalach</em> is like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rashi: \n<ul>\n<li>No sons - yisurin not of love</li>\n<li>Sons r\"l died - yisurin of love <-- There are tzadikim whose sons have died</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Tosfot:\n    - We have seen tzadkim with no sons</li>\n<li>Rashi's answer to Tosfot (by the Tzlach):\n These tzadkim were not punished with yisurin, this was their nature.</li>\n<li>Tsofot (by the Tzlach):\nThere are tzadkim without the nature (they had daughters) and without sons (ironically Rashi himself). Were these not yisurin of love?!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>My question now is:</strong>\nThe Tosfot should be answering with an example of a tzadik who never had sons but did daughters (like Rashi), but instead bring an example of R. Yochanan\nwho had sons who died and also daughters. What am I missing in Tosfot or the Tzlach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37718&st=&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tzlach</a> explains this sentence as follows. (Though I'm not sure I'm understanding him fully either.)</p>\n\n<p>If a tzaddik has no children, then this is definitely not יסורין של אהבה, as the Gemara concludes But if he has daughters but no sons, then that may be יסורין של אהבה or it may not.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Rashi says that R' Yochanan's suffering, of having his sons die (רחמנא ליצלן), must be יסורין של אהבה because a great man such as he would surely have had no other kind. To this Tosafos objects: that's fine if he at least had daughters, like R' Yochanan himself - we can still consider this יסורין של אהבה. But what of the many tzaddikim who had no children at all? According to Rashi's logic, since this can't be יסורין של אהבה, doesn't that force us to classify it as sin-related יסורין? And the answer is that it's not: the inability to have children is not necessarily any kind of Divine chastisement - it may simply be that he or she is infertile (due to physiological or mazal-related causes).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14521&st=&pgnum=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sfas Emes</a>. When the Gemara says that childlessness is a punishment caused by sin, it isn't referring to those people who have had children in previous incarnations.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos is aware that Tzadikim may have had children from previous incarnations and thus are not considered truly childless.</p>\n\n<p>Instead Tosfos was asking from one specific Tzadik who had no children <em>and</em> had none from a previous incarnation: Joshua (see Tos. Rosh and Bach). The question is: how could Joshua have been punished by true childlessness if this is a sign of sin? Isn't Joshua at least as great as Rabbi Yochanan was?</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos then follows up: and don't tell me that Joshua wasn't truly childless either, since he had daughters. For Rabbi Yochanan, too, had daughters, and still the Gemara asked from his sons' deaths? So we see that having daughters doesn't mitigate the punishment of losing sons, therefore it likewise shouldn't mitigate the punishment of never having had sons?</p>\n\n\n",

Just like that, during YomTov, I don't think he'd even discussed it with his parents, who were categorically expecting him to return to Chutz L'oretz for University, after two years in Yeshiva in EY.\nThe Posek told him to daven like Bnei EY, and keep all as a Ben EY from that point onwards, so mid YomTov, he was now a Ben EY. I think it may have been second day so he'd davened a chutz L'Oretz YT davening for maariv the night before, and now in the day, after lengthy discussion with the Posek, was davening as a Ben EY. He was much missed at the Yom Tov Seudoh, while he was enjoying himself learning in the Beis Hamedresh.\nThat's about 11 years ago. He barely leaves EY and still learning there. Kein Yirbu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I was visting Israel to decide which community I wanted to live in, a person there suggested that I buy a room or closet in someone's house so that I can be currently owning some land in Israel. At that point, I would be only required to keep one day Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>If they decide in the middle of Yom Tov that they want to move to Israel,  in that case (if the logic works at all) you would not be able to purchase the item.  I don't know what would happen if someone who keeps 1 day decided to buy you the land and then give it to you as a gift.. perhaps that could work.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why should A Capella music be allowed during Sefirah/Three Weeks?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how I feel about: a)the custom to refrain from listening to recorded music during Sefirah or b)the assumption that recorded a cappella music is not considered instrumental (despite the fact that there is nobody sitting in front of you singing; ie., the recording is itself an instrument). OK, I'm pretty sure we all can tell how I feel about b. Anyone disagree, though? And any thoughts on a?</p>\n\n<p>I'm also not entirely sure why live singing isn't a problem during Sefirah (assuming it's done for the sake of making people happy and spreading joy).</p>\n\n<p>I understand that refraining from listening to music appears to be  Minhag Yisrael, but it's not mentioned anywhere before later Aḥaronim - even the RaM\"A doesn't mention it: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9008&st&pgnum=292\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9008&st&pgnum=292</a> (or does someone else contemporaneous to or preceding the MeḤaber mention it?).</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I'm operating on a couple of assumptions, so please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The practice to refrain from listening to music during the period - not discussing the prohibition the rest of the year, which is clearly not followed by most - is a (comparatively) recent trend.</li>\n<li>I don't believe the prohibition was ever an issue of personal joy, so much as public expressions of joy/celebration.</li>\n<li>Live performance of music is one of many forms of expression/manifestation of public joy and celebration, especially when accompanied by dancing. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>So, considering all of the above, why is live a cappella ok? And if instrumental music itself is a problem why is recorded a cappella ok?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Apparently it is not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are basically three types of a cappella.</p>\n  \n  <p>One is where the musical sounds originate from human voices but the\n  natural properties are digitally modified with computer software to\n  attain quality of sounds that are not humanly possible, thus making it\n  sound more like regular music. Such a cappella is halachically not\n  viewed as being any different from regular music.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are other forms of a cappella which sound very similar to\n  regular music, although no digital modification is done to the voices.\n  These types of a cappella should also not be listened to during\n  Sefirah and The Three Weeks, as will be explained shortly.</p>\n  \n  <p>The third type of a cappella is where regular songs are sung by an\n  individual or choir.

    "content": "# When do rabbinic enactments apply if the given reason no longer does?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Often we find gezeiros d'rabbanan designed as preventative measures against more serious transgressions.\nHowever, if nowadays the reasoning behind the gezeira does not apply, it seems that sometimes we say \"batla ta'am batla takana\"- if the reason no longer applies, neither does the enactment- and sometimes we do not say this, but rather continue to obey the enactment even after its reasoning is no longer applicable.</p>\n<p>For example: On the one hand, with regard to the takana not to lend money to gentiles with interest so as not to become involved in business with non-jews and become familiar with their way of life, we say that today one may do so even if not necessary for his livelihood (the loophole offered by chazal), since we are all anyways involved in business with non-jews.</p>\n<p>Also, with regard to dancing on Shabbos, Tosafos (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beitza 30a</a> ד\"ה תנן) hold that today (at least in their day) since people are not experts in musical instrument repair, there is no reason left to continue the takana.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we find that people still practice mayim acharonim after meals even though the danger described by chazal no longer exists. We find that people are careful not to depict the full sun or moon, even though celestial worshipers have virtually ceased to exist as well. Also, some insist that it is still prohibited to do laundry on Friday even though laundry is much quicker today than it was in Ezra HaSofer's time.</p>\n<p>The question is: Is there a proper distinction between two types of rabbinic enactments that allows us to distinguish whether or not continuation of the enactment is dependent on the reason it was enacted? [Please cite sources.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Beitza (5a) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבה מתקנת רבן יוחנן בן זכאי ואילך ביצה מותרת דתנן משחרב בית המקדש התקין רבן יוחנן בן זכאי שיהו מקבלין עדות החדש כל היום אמר ליה אביי והא רב ושמואל דאמרי תרוייהו ביצה אסורה אמר ליה אמינא לך אנא רבן יוחנן בן זכאי ואת אמרת לי רב ושמואל ולרב ושמואל קשיא מתניתין לא קשיא הא לן והא להו ורב יוסף אמר אף מתקנת רבן יוחנן בן זכאי ואילך ביצה אסורה מאי טעמא <strong>הוי דבר שבמנין וכל דבר שבמנין צריך מנין אחר להתירו...</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to R' Yosef, a gzeira stands even if the reason no longer applies, unless a greater (and more numerous) beis din annuls their decree.</p>\n<p>The Rambam rules like this (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e302.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mamrim 2:2-3</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בית דין שגזרו גזירה, או התקינו תקנה, והנהיגו מנהג, ופשט כל הדבר בכל ישראל, ועמד אחריהם בית דין אחר, וביקש לבטל דברי הראשונים ולעקור אותה התקנה ואותה הגזירה ואותו המנהג--אינו יכול, עד שיהיה גדול מן הראשונים בחכמה ובמניין.</p>\n<p>היה גדול בחכמה אבל לא במניין, במניין אבל לא בחכמה--אינו יכול לבטל את דבריו; אפילו בטל טעם שבגללו גזרו הראשונים או התקינו--אין האחרונים יכולין לבטל, עד שיהיו גדולים מהם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He even says that gzeiros to prevent an issur can never be nullified, though I'm not sure if everyone agrees to that.</p>\n<p>But as a general rule, <strong>a gzeira stands even if the reason no longer applies</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Ra'avad questions the Rambam from the fact that R' Yochanon cancelled certain takanos after the churban, so you see a beis din can cancel an earlier takana even if it's not greater than previous one, if the reason no longer applies.The Kesef Mishna (I think) says that R' Yochanon's Beis Din was greater, while the Radvaz offers another answer: The Rambam was just discussing standard gzeirso that don't mention their reason. <em>However, if the gzeira mentions the reason, it can be cancelled once the reason no longer applies</em> (it would still require a beis din though). According to the Radvaz, you could perhaps get a beis din together to cancel certain specific takkanos that mention their reason.</p>\n<p>Those are the basic principles, what about the <strong>practical cases</strong>?</p>\n<p>In general, taking <strong>medicine</strong> is assur on shabbos lest you grind medicine. In recent times, people stopped grinding their own medicine, yet modern poskim still forbid taking medicine on shabbos. This fits with the general principle that gzeiros still stand even if there reason doesn't.</p>\n<p>Sometimes <strong>common practice</strong> will seem to go against a specific gzeira. In such cases, it is common for tosafot to explain common practice, sometime with a strong justification, sometimes a bit more <em>dochek</em>.</p>\n<p>I have not looked into the issue of lending with ribbis to non-Jews, but it seems many of those gzeiros in Meseches Avodah Zarah were not fully kept in Europe.</p>\n<p>Many poskim express wonderment at the Tosafos that permits <strong>dancing and clapping</strong> on shabbos. <strong>R. M. Feinstein</strong> says that in a case where there's some [external] <em>cheshash</em> (such as mayim geluim from snake poison), the gzeira would no longer apply once the reason is gone. However, the gzeira against dancing is against the action itself, and it should stand no matter what. He feels the Tosafot should not be relied upon, but feels bound to provide some explanation since the Rema and common practice allow it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה לע\"ד שהטעם הוא דנחשבה כלא פשטה הגזירה אף שכבר פשטה בימיהםאבל כיון שעכשיו נשתנה מכפי שהיה בימיהם שנסתלק הטעם לא נחשב מהשפשטה בעת שהיה הטעם לפשטה גם עכשיו כשליכא הטעם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He suggests its as if the gzeira didn't spread, though its a bit unclear how that works. He then goes on to discuss how its as if a virtual gathering or rabbis annulled the decree, but says a baal nefesh should be machmir.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Aruch haShulchan</strong> takes a different approach, and tries to justify common practice by claiming that modern clapping and dancing might not have been included in the takana, since its less in sync with the song.</p>\n<p><strong>Mayim Achronim</strong> is easier to explain. If it is just because of the danger of melech sdomis, then if the danger no longer exists, the issur may end. It's just an external cheshahs just like <em>mayim geluim</em>, etc. The question is just if there's other reasons for mayim achronim (such as having clean hands), and whether the danger is really gone.</p>\n<p>In <strong>conclusion</strong>, the rule is that gzeiros apply even if the reason no longer applies, but poskim may try to find kulos to justify common practice. So if modern circumstances are different they may not have been included in the takana. If a gzeria is just because of an external chesahsh, it's easy to say it ends once the reason ends.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:0132J7m3wSsJ:www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/beshiv/beshiv207.doc%20&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg9xDhfOUCgD-CDdrsXulTmuOg2CTkiP1CKNW7NdA_rLu8P9EhM_FewUHyQoWHfnx1A-m1KuyUw4SHJiUfzdnAqbL5-dQci6p_lfIiB6-naW13Yg6Gkxzm3t89KnCfo25fcVrzq&sig=AHIEtbSsyz4hYxTXWFTfkEk6zO1MS9WiZA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בטל הטעם לא בטלה התקנה</a> (Google Doc Viewer)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=1la1NMvWJy8J0EYbvJqvwLyLTU3GLa-XnSU26fAlcNmec-1C-iGLdPoq7pjZg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mekoros</a> (PDF on Docs - Hebrew and English)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>See Igros Moshe (OC:2:100) regarding the enactment prohibiting dancing on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The basic rule is where we can interpret the original enactment as having allowed for its expiration due to shifting realities, then we say it expires. In the case of gilui, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein says we interpret the enactment not as one that prohibits exposed liquids; rather, it obligates one to refrain from endangering oneself with possibly tainted drink, even if the possibility is remote. Therefore in areas where the possibility doesn't exist, no enactment was ever in force.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>If you're looking for a perfect theory of everything it may take a lot of mental gymnastics, but in addition to the above excellent answers, here are a few pointers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There are a whole host of rabbinically-prohibited activities on Shabbos known as <em>shevus</em>. It appears that with these, the rabbis prohibited entire categories of actions so that our shabbos would not feel like a weekday; however the rabbis hung the prohibition on a \"lest you violate this Torah prohibition\" -- presumably they felt they needed a bit of reinforcement. \"Business activity\" is prohibited; the reason given was \"lest you write\", but it seems they used that as an excuse to keep our heads out of the office on shabbos. Similarly, \"medical treatment for minor nuisances\"; the reason given is \"lest you grind herbs\", but Rambam rules it even applies to certain forms of massage that are medicalized. Again presumably, if it's something really small, shabbos is a good day for us to let go and let G-d, so to speak. It's even been suggested that the category of \"musical instruments\" -- \"lest you fix them\" -- was an excuse for \"outside the Temple, you shouldn't be that over-the-top happy.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Occasionally it was clear that \"don't do X because of Y, but in rare cases where Y doesn't apply you may do X.\" Here clearly the only reason was Y, and hence we can expand the loophole to say \"today Y almost never applies.\" For instance, the Gemara discusses a prohibition on bathing out of mourning, then says Rabbi So-and-so bathed anyhow because he was extremely sensitive (<em>istenis</em>). It's reasonable to argue that today we've all become so accustomed to regular bathing that a lot of us fall in the <em>istenis</em> category.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the specific Talmudic rabbinic prohibition was on X because of Y, then X may be prohibited regardless of Y; however, in similar cases the Talmud did not discuss, we use common sense to determine if Y applies.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Talmud says clearly a woman has to wait three months between one marriage and the next (so if she becomes visibly pregnant soon after the second marriage, we'll have no doubts on paternity); the three-month-wait rule in this case is generally considered an absolute. <em>However</em>, over the centuries, a newly-converted woman was expected to wait three months before getting married, so we know if the baby was conceived Jewish. As this was not explicitly covered by Talmudic ban, however, twentieth-century halachic authorities (including Rabbi Melech Schachter zt\"l, father of the contemporary Rabbi Herschel shlit'a) said we can use common sense and simply have her take a pregnancy test. </li>\n<li>Similarly, among various Talmudic bans intended to set up proper fences from the non-Jewish population, was one that said \"don't buy mystery milk from a non-Jew.\" If you walk up to a random farmer in the middle of Libya and he hands you a bucket of milk, that milk is rabbinically prohibited -- even if you then send it to a lab and prove that it's 100% cow/sheep/goat/giraffe/you-get-the-idea milk. Because this is the exact case that the rabbis prohibited. However if you go to a random farmer in Libya and buy butter or powdered milk (according to R' Tzvi Pesach Frank and others), those products weren't under the original ban. Thus if you chemically ascertain the ingredients are kosher, you're all set. (Or in contemporary applications, if your definition of \"mystery milk\" is \"anything milked without a Jew observing\", many rabbis will still allow you to buy powdered milk where the combination of regulation and economics makes it obvious the ingredients are kosher.) </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Most medical practices in the Talmud are determined to be tied to the science they experienced then and there; today we work with mainstream medicine as we know it. The prohibition on fish-with-meat seems to be the odd exception, which leaves the Magen Avraham scratching his head -- I thought he's saying \"but eh whatever keep it anyway\", but Rabbi Herschel Schachter shtlit'a reads the Magen Avraham as saying \"it's permissible.\" (Someone pressed him on this -- \"so would you eat it in your house?\" \"My wife would throw me out of the kitchen!\" \"Okay suppose you were a guest at my house and I was serving it, would you eat it?\" \"Well ... I <em>should</em> ...) Others have suggested that if the medical practice was explicitly tied to some medical reason, then we can say \"apply our science instead\"; fish-and-meat was always rather hazy as to why, so it stuck.</li>\n<li>If the rabbinic enactment told people to <em>not</em> do that which was a mitzva, it must be limited in scope to its reasoning. (Megillah/lulav/shofar/etc. on shabbos is a different subject.)\n<ul>\n<li>The Torah allows one to wear a four-cornered linen garment with <em>techelet</em>-dyed-wool strings, and doing so would be a mitzva. However according to many interpretations, the rabbis banned linen four-cornered-garments because there are too many ways for something to go wrong and suddenly you'd be violating the prohibition of <em>shaatnez</em>. Yet when Rabbeinu Asher moved from Germany (cold climate) to Spain (warm climate) around the year 1300, he found Spanish Jews wearing linen garments with linen strings. They explained that the ban was tied to the existence of <em>techelet</em>-dyed-wool, which was no longer around and hence the ban was lifted. He approved of the logic.</li>\n<li>Generally it's a mitzvah to print Jewish books. Yet printing was such a risky and expensive endeavor that if someone else came out with a similar item the next day for a few rubles less, I could be ruined -- left to the free market, printing seforim would not have happened because the risks were too high. Thus the rabbinic leadership would enact a public policy: \"Baum & Sons [I'm picking a random name] are printing a Talmud; we will prohibit anyone else from doing so for the next three years, to give them the opportunity to get back into the black.\" Such a case happened in the 1800s and as it turned out it was a wild success; they were very, very healthily and solidly in the black by the end of year one. It was ruled that this <em>don't-do-a-mitzva</em> enactment had to be limited in scope to its reason, and thus the market was opened to competitors at that point.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

(Incidentally, <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> notes that this was not the custom in his area at his time. In any event:)</p>\n\n<p>My question is, why <em>s'lichos</em> specifically? Why don't we say, for the same reason of \"<em>hamaschil b'mitzva...</em>\", that whoever leads <em>shacharis</em> any day should lead the rest of the day's prayers?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I see that the <em>L'vush</em> gives a different reason. [Apparently, in his time and place, a set <em>chazan</em> would lead <em>shacharis</em> every day, and whoever led <em>shacharis</em> on a <em>s'lichos</em> day would fast.] Thus, he writes, have the <em>s'lichos</em> leader lead <em>shacharis</em> also, instead of the usual <em>shacharis</em> leader, [and, I gather, vary the <em>s'lichos</em> leaders from day to day,] in order that no one person need to fast every day.</p>\n\n<p>However, this doesn't answer my question on the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and those who quote him, who don't give that reason.</p>\n\n<p>(Note also that the <em>L'vush</em>'s reason would seem not to apply nowadays, when the <em>s'lichos</em> leader does not AFAIK fast (and when we don't necessarily have the same leader daily, although many synagogues do de facto, as there is a mourner leading).

For example, if one says <em>s'lichos</em>, but then leaves and neglects to pray shacharis and mincha, he has not fulfilled the obligation of <em>s'lichos</em> either. It must be that the <em>s'lichos</em> are connected somehow to the other <em>t'fillos</em> of the day. (I'm not so sure about the connection to ma'ariv.

On a regular day, each <em>t'filla</em> is a separate <em>mitzva</em>, and each can have a different <em>ba'al t'filla</em>. But on a day with <em>s'lichos</em>, the <em>s'lichos</em> are connected to the other prayers of the day. (That is, even though shacharis and mincha are seperate from each other, they are both connected to the <em>s'lichos</em> of that day.)

However, made an עירוב חצירות within an enclosure in order to combine the רשות היחידים through food (usually people use מצות since they last a long time, and are זכין לאדם שלו בפניו so every one owns it).\nIf the whole point of the שלומו's גזירה is to stop people from not knowing about carrying, isn't there a problem of the עירוב חצירות since most people don't even know it exists? Yes, we should try and educate people.</p>\n\n<p>Enclosure for an עירוב\nרה\"ר מן התורה – Two reasons why its hard to make an עירוב;\n1) Needs to be a wall of at least 10 טפחים high.\n2) (אתו רבים ומבטלי מחיצות כשיש פרצה של יתר מעשר (אמות – When there is a hole or breach in the enclosure wall which is greater than 10 אמות ?wide, if it is a place where people go through the wall, that side of the wall is halachically considered non-existent, and the entire enclosure isn't good.</p>\n\n<p>רה\"י – Nowadays an enclosure for a רה\"י is generally created using a צורת הפתח, which is a combination of two posts with either a wooden bar or a string running across the top of both (they need to be above the posts), connecting them.</p>\n\n<p>Why would a צורת הפתח not be a viable option for a רה\"ר מן התורה? First we need to understand the מקור for a צורת הפתח.</p>\n\n<p>צורת הפתח\n:עירובין ו:, יא.,יא – A צורת הפתח can work as a dividing wall and an enclosure.\nשו\"ע אורח חיים שסב – You can even use string on top.\nHow does it work as an enclosure, isn't almost completely open?\nראשונים, אחרונים – We view it halachically as an enclosure, since if you open the door of your house your house is still a רשות היחיד despite the fact that its almost completely open.\n.עירובין יא – A צורת הפתח can definitely work as a מחיצה המפסקת (dividing wall) מן התורה. We learn this from כלאים, since if you have two types of plants which would be considered כלאים with nothing between them, you can build a צורת הפתח in between them מן התורה and they aren't considered כלאים, therefore we apply the same idea to עירובין.\nTherefore, מן התורה, if you have an enclosure of three walls (eg a מבוי, a courtyard surrounded with walls), מן התורה you can use a צורת הפתח as a third wall, and if you have two walls you can use two צורת הפתחs as two walls.</p>\n\n<p>חזון איש – Based on 'תוס on .עירובין ו says that you can have a full enclosure of צורת הפתחים on 4 sides.\nMost רשאונים, אחרונים – No, since its based off of כלאים, and by כלאים its not an enclosure, its just a מחיצה המפסקת.</p>\n\n<p>פרי מגדים, משנב ברורה, etc. - Therefore a צורת הפתח can't divide a רה\"ר, and you need a wall as an enclosure for a רה\"ר.</p>\n\n<p>צורת הפתח\nר\"י עירובין יא., רא\"ש, רשב\"א, ר\"ן - Can be used for a רה\"ר דארייתא.\nחזון איש סימן ע אות יג – Agrees.\nשו\"ע הרב אורח חיים שסד – Is also מיקל.\nר האי גאון, רמב\"ם, ריצב\"א, רבינו חננאל – Can't be used.\nבאור הלכה שסב:י ד\"ה כשכל – Discusses this 'מח, says it is possible that they agree they can be used for רה\"ר although probably not, so says its a ספק.\nפרי מגדים שסג – Also says its a ספק so we are מחמר since its דארייתא.</p>\n\n<p>What about if there are walls around the community or you hold that צורת הפתח are ok דארייתא?\nאתו רבים ומבטלי מחיצות\n.עירובין כ.,כב – According to ר' יהודה and ר' יוחנן its פסול דארייתא, according to חכמים and ר' אלעיזר its only a פסול דרבנן.\nבאור הלכה שסד – Majority hold its a פסול דארייתא.\nרמב\"ם יז:י – Its only דרבנן.</p>\n\n<p>What about if you close the doors at night of the city so אתו רבים doesn't apply at night?\nשו\"ע שסד:ב - It solves the problem since it needs to be constant.\nSome say even if you could close the gates and you don't there is no problem.\nTo solve this problem nowadays some Jews go one day a year to set roads and put a sheet across to show that it could be closed, although this is not so פשוט.\nרמ\"א quoting מהר\"ם מרוטנברג – The whole פסול of אתו רבים only applies when the walls that its removing are actually required מן התורה.\nTherefore, in a כרמלית since its are מקום פטור מן התורה it doesn't apply.</p>\n\n<p>רה\"ר דארייתא\n5 conditions that everyone agrees to that makes a רשות a רה\"ר דארייתא;\n1) .שבת צט - The main street(s) need to be 16 אמות wide.\n2) It can not have a roof (therefore, for eg, if a store on the main street has a canopy over the front then under the canopy isn't included in the width of the street).\n3) It has to have less than 3 walls.\n4) It has to be owned by the public.\n5) :עירובין נט - It has to be מפולש משער לשער (open ended).\nR' Moshe Feinstein – Side streets are also called רה\"ר מן התורה if the main streets are since it 'spills over'.\nTherefore it seems that almost all cities are רה\"ר מן התורה.</p>\n\n<p>חזון איש – Buildings can count as walls, so they can be used to solve a רה\"ר מן התורה (either because its like three walls or other buildings block it).</p>\n\n<p>משכנות יעקב – Disagrees and says that a building can't be used as a wall, either its a building or a wall.\nMost communities aren't נוהג like the חזון איש.</p>\n\n<p>רמב\"ן – On #5 You need to have מפולש משער לשער בלי שום עיקום כלל (they need to be perfectly straight all the way through).\nTherefore it would be extremely hard to get a רה\"ר מן התורה since most cities have streets that curve.\nR' Moshe Feinstein – Rejects the רמב\"ן since he is a שיטת יחיד.</p>\n\n<p>'רש\"י עירובין ו., תוס, many other ראשונים – It needs 600 thousand people to be a רה\"ר (they learn this from the fact that there were 600, 000 Jews in the מדבר, where we learn out the idea of carrying from the משכן).\nDoes this mean only living there or even traversing?\nR' Moshe Feinstein, מ\"ב – Even 600, 000 living there.\nמשכנות יעקב – When is there a case of a city 600, 000 people? Very few cities, so would חז\"ל uproot carrying שופר on שבת for one or two cities? It must be people living in it.\nTherefore, most cities aren't actually a רה\"ר מן התורה, rather a כרמלית according to these ראשונים.\nרמב\"ם הל' שבת, רי\"ף – Never mention it.\nבית יוסף שמה – If רמב\"ם doesn't mention it, its not included.\nרמב\"ן, ר\"ת, רשב\"ם, many others – All are מחמר and reject the היתר.\nשו\"ע שמה:ז, שו\"ת אבקת רוכל ס' כט – Rejects the היתר.</p>\n\n<p>שו\"ע שג:יח – There is no רה\"ר מן התורה nowadays.\nHow can he say this, isn't 600,000 not a good היתר?\nמגן אברהם שמה, ט\"ז – The שו\"ע is מיקל and holds it is a good היתר.\nמ\"ב, many others – No, he meant in certain cases that if its a question if its an act of לבישה then in those cases we can be מיקל, but really its not ok.\nR' Ovadiah Yosef – Therefore, generally ספרדים shouldn't rely on עירובין.\nבית אפרים – The שו\"ע actually didn't take any opinion. (This opinion doesn't seem right.)</p>\n\n<p>רמ\"א שמו:ג – All our domains today are a כרמלית, and there is no רה\"ר דארייתא.\nט\"ז שמה ס\"ק ו – Requires 600,000 to be a רה\"ר מדארייתא based on this רמ\"א.\nמגן אברהם שם ס\"ק ו – Understands the רמ\"א this way, and says רוב פוסקים are מיקל.\nבית מאיר – The רמ\"א is לאו דווקה. (R' Schreiber – Doesn't seem correct.)\nמ\"ב שמה ס\"ק ג, באור הלכה – Don't quote the רמ\"א.\nשו\"ע הרב, חיי אדם, ערוך השולחן, מ\"ב, באור הלכה – All agree that the מנהג of אשכנז is that you need 600,000.\nערוך השולחן שמה:יח – Its like a בת קול came out and told us to be מיקל like this its so entrenched in אשכנז.</p>\n\n<p>מהרש\"ל יד של שלמה ביצה ג:ח – Was מחמר, proving it from the fact that חז\"ל were גוזר you can't blow שופר on שבת on רה\"ר, since why would they be גוזר if there are so few places that are רה\"ר?\nמשכנות יעקב או\"ח קט:קיט-קכב – Was very against this היתר, and said that if all these גדולים knew about all the ראשונים against it (since they weren't published in their times), they wouldn't have been מיקל. Also, it says נחמיה יג:יד-לא that נחמיה he was angry that ב\"י carried on שבת, even though they were only 400,000, and therefore he wouldn't be so angry for only דרבנן, therefore it must have been a רה\"ר דארייתא and the היתר of 600,000 doesn't exist. (R' Schreiber – Second ראיה doesn't seem correct, why wouldn't he be angry for a דרבנן?!)</p>\n\n<p>מ\"ב שסד:ב באור הלכה ד\"ה מאחר שעשה – We assume three things להלכה; that צורת הפתח works in a רה\"ר דארייתא, that אתו רבים is only a פסול דרבנן like the רמב\"ם, and since the issue is an אסור דרבנן since צה\"פ works and אתו is only דרבנן, we are מיקל in the ספק of the היתר of 600,00 and say that without that many people its not a רה\"ר.\nRav Shechter, others – What the מ\"ב meant was that it was a ספיק ספיקא לקולה. The first ספק is whether a צה\"פ works in a רה\"ר דארייתא, and the second ספק is even if we hold צה\"פ doesn't work in רה\"ר דארייתא, maybe we do need 600,000 to make a רה\"ר דארייתא, and we hold like the רמב\"ם that אתו רבים is דרבנן (?end).</p>\n\n<p>ערוך השולחן שמה:כ-כב – Says that because the עירובין have spread throughout all the communities for many years its like a בת קול has come out and said its ok, and if פוסקים tried to go against it, the people would say they are crazy and its a מצוה to be מלמד זכות for ב\"י, so therefore he comes up with this קולא; that even cities that have 600,000 aren't רה\"ר since the city needs to have only two major streets that cross each other perpendicularly, and the rest around it need to be minor streets.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Also, a רה\"ר needs to have one central place where everyone goes to buy food etc (like a market), so nowadays since its spread out they aren't רה\"ר.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What about a city? How do you rent the streets?\nגמרא – Go to the governor (מושל העיר).\nWhat about the problem of their homes being inside the enclosure (since the צה\"פ circles the entire community), and the מושל העיר doesn't own everything?</p>\n\n<p>We actually buy the entire city from the מושל העיר, since he really owns everything.\nWhat about in a democracy?</p>\n\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein – In a democracy its even better, since the government rents out everyone's homes, so we buy the entire city for שבת.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>YU Museum exhibit on Eruvim:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://yumuseum.tumblr.com/ItsAThinLine\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://yumuseum.tumblr.com/ItsAThinLine</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/54825799\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://vimeo.com/54825799</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/arts/its-a-thin-line-the-eruv-and-jewish-community-in-new-york-and-beyond/2013/01/11/0/?print\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/arts/its-a-thin-line-the-eruv-and-jewish-community-in-new-york-and-beyond/2013/01/11/0/?print</a></p>\n\n\n",

The other tanna does not state that teaching girls Torah is forbidden; rather, he states that teaching girls Torah has a negative consequence.</p>\n\n<p>In the Jerusalem Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14142&st=&pgnum=528\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah 3:4</a>), however, this second opinion is taken to a further extreme, with the assertion that the Torah should be burned rather than given over to women:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מטרונה שאלה את רבי לעזר מפני מה חט אחת במעשה העגל והן מתים בה שלש\n  מיתות אמר לה אין חכמתה של אשה אלא בפילכה דכתיב וכל אשה חכמת לב בידיה\n  טוו אמר לו הורקנוס בנו בשביל שלא להשיבה דבר אחד מן התורה איבדת ממני\n  שלש מאות כור מעשר בכל שנה אמר ליה ישרפו דברי תורה ואל ימסרו לנשים\n  וכשיצתה אמרו לו תלמידיו רבי לזו דחיתה לנו מה אתה משיב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=172\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Talmud Torah 1:13</a>) codifies the law as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה שלמדה תורה יש לה שכר אבל אינו כשכר האיש מפני שלא נצטוית וכל העושה\n  דבר שאינו מצווה עליו לעשותו אין שכרו כשכר המצווה שעשה אלא פחות ממנו\n  ואע\"פ שיש לה שכר צוו חכמים שלא ילמד אדם את בתו תורה מפני שרוב הנשים\n  אין דעתם מכוונת להתלמד אלא הן מוציאות דברי תורה לדברי הבאי לפי עניות\n  דעתן אמרו חכמים כל המלמד את בתו תורה כאילו למדה תפלות בד\"א בתורה שבעל\n  פה אבל תורה שבכתב לא ילמד אותה לכתחלה ואם למדה אינו כמלמדה תפלות</p>\n  \n  <p>A woman who studies Torah will receive reward. However, that reward\n  will not be [as great] as a man's, since she was not commanded [in\n  this mitzvah]. Whoever performs a deed which he is not commanded to\n  do, does not receive as great a reward as one who performs a mitzvah\n  that he is commanded to do.</p>\n  \n  <p>Even though she will receive a reward, the Sages commanded that a\n  person should not teach his daughter Torah, because most women cannot\n  concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of\n  Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding.</p>\n  \n  <p>[Thus,] our Sages declared: \"Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is\n  like one who teaches her tales and parables.\" This applies to the Oral\n  Law. [With regard to] the Written Law: at the outset, one should not\n  teach one's daughter. However, if one teaches her, it is not\n  considered as if she was taught idle things. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910973/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Rambam appears to decide in favor of the second opinion in the Mishnah (as he states simply that \"the Sages\" said that teaching girls = tiflus). We also see two new points from Rambam's formulation. First, he adds that the Sages commanded not to teach girls (as opposed to the Mishnah which only mentioned the negative consequence but no command against teaching them), and second he distinguishes between the Written Torah and the Oral Torah, arguing that the negative comments in the Mishnah were in reference to the Oral Law. Teaching girls the Written Law was not included, though it is still frowned upon.</p>\n\n<p>However, despite the overall negative attitude displayed in this formulation, we must remember that he started it off by saying that if a woman does study Torah she receives reward, implying that it is in some sense a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the rishonim/poskim follow Rambam in adopting the second opinion in the Mishnah. Notably, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani_the_Younger\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Isaiah De Trani (the Younger)</a> states that although women are not required to be taught Torah, it is allowed. More importantly, in the second sentence he explicitly rules like the first opinion in the Mishnah, stating that in the times when the sotah ritual was in force one was obligated to teach his daughter Torah:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Piskei Riaz Sotah 1:2</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אע\"פ שאין האשה מצווה על תלמוד תורה כמו שנ' ולמדתם אותם את בניכם ולא את\n  בנותיכם אם רצה ללמדה הרשות בידו כמבואר בקונטרס הראייות בראיי' ב' ובזמן\n  שהיו משקין את הסוטות חייב אדם ללמד את בתו תורה שאם תשתה ותנצל תדע\n  שהזכות תלת לה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tur and Shulchan Aruch codify the law following the formulation of Rambam. (The Tur actually reverses the Written Law and Oral Law but the Beis Yosef attributes that to a printer's error.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6223\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Tur Y.D. 246</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כ' הרמב\"ם ז\"ל אשה שלמדה תורה יש לה שכר אבל לא כשכר האיש מפני שאינה\n  מצווה ועושה וכל העושה דבר שאינו מצווה עליו אין שכרו כשכר המצווה ועושה\n  ואע\"פ שיש לה שכר צוו חכמים שלא ילמד אדם את בתו תורה מפני שרוב נשים אין\n  דעתם מכוונת להתלמד ומוציאין דברי תורה לדברי הבאי לפי עניות דעתם אמרו\n  חכמים כל המלמד לבתו תורה כאילו מלמדה תפלות בד\"א בתורה שבכתב אבל בתורה\n  שבע\"פ לא ילמד אותה בתחילה ואם מלמדה אינו כמלמדה תפלות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6715\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 246:6</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה שלמדה תורה יש לה שכר אבל לא כשכר האיש מפני שאינה מצווה ועושה ואע\"פ\n  שיש לה שכר צוו חז\"ל שלא ילמד אדם את בתו תורה מפני שרוב הנשים אין דעתן\n  מכוונת להתלמד ומוציאות דברי תורה לדברי הבאי לפי עניות דעתן אמרו חכמים\n  כל המלמד את בתו תורה כאילו מלמדה תיפלות (פי' דבר עבירה) בד\"א בתורה\n  שבע\"פ אבל תורה שבכתב לא ילמד אותה לכתחלה ואם מלמדה אינו כמלמדה תיפלות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This view is also more or less echoed in the Levush and the Aruch Hashulchan.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9276&st=&pgnum=276\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Levush Y.D. 246:6</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה שלמדה תורה אף על פי שאינה מצווה יש לה שכר אבל לא כשכר האיש שכל\n  המצוה על דבר ומקיימו יש לו שכר יותר ממי שאינו מצווה ומקיימו מפני\n  שהמצווה דואג תמיד לבטל יצרו ולקיים מצות בוראו מה שאין כן במי שאינו\n  מצווה שאינו דואג אלא עושה אותה מרצונו מכל מקום שכר קצת יש לו מיהו אף\n  על פי שיש לאשה קצת שכר כשלומדת תורה צוו חז\"ל שלא ילמד אדם את בתו תורה\n  מפני שרוב הנשים אין דעתן מכוונות להתלמד ומוציאות דברי תורה לדברי הבאי\n  לפי עניות דעתן אמרו חכמים ז\"ל  כל המלמד את בתו תורה כאילו מלמדה תיפלות\n  במה דברים אמורים בתורה שבעל פה שהוא דבר עמוק וצריך עיון רב ואין דעתן\n  סובלתו אבל תורה שבכתב לא ילמוד אותה לכתחלה ואם מלמדה אינו כמלמדה\n  תיפלות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=228\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan Y.D. 246:19</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה אינה מצווה בת\"ת וכתבו הפוסקים אשה שלמדה תורה יש לה שכר אבל לא כשכר\n  האיש מפני שאינה מצווה וגדול שכר המצווה ועושה ממי שאינו מצווה ועושה\n  מפני שהמצווה יצרו מסיתו לבלי לקיים והוא דואג תמיד לבטל יצרו ולקיים\n  מצות בוראו משא\"כ מי שאינו מצווה אין יצרו מסיתו על ההיפך ואע\"פ שיש לה\n  שכר צוו חז\"ל [סוטה כ א] לבלי ללמד לבתו תורה ואמרו חכמים דכל המלמדה\n  תורה כאלו מלמדה תפלות כלומר דבר עבירה והטעם דמפני שדעתן קלות ומוציאין\n  ד\"ת לדברי הבאי לפי דעתן הדלה בד\"א בתורה שבע\"פ אבל בתורה שבכתב לא ילמד\n  אותה לכתחלה ואם מלמדה אינו כמלמדה תפלות כן כתבו הרמב\"ם והש\"ע ובטור\n  כתוב להיפך דתורה שבכתב הוי כמלמדה תפלות ולא תורה שבע\"פ ע\"ש וכתבו שטעות\n  הדפוס הוא [ב\"י] ויש מי שרוצה לקיים הגירסא ואינו מספיק [עי' פרישה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It thus appears that the standard codes follow the opinion that teaching the Oral Law to women is frowned upon. Note that so far we have seen no distinctions between different works of the Oral Law (e.g. that it is okay to study Mishnah but not Talmud).</p>\n\n<p>However, there are a number of exceptions even within this view. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_ben_Moshe_Levi_Moelin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Jacob Moelin</a> explains that the only problem with the Oral Law is when someone teaches it to his daughter. But if she learns it herself then it is okay, and that is when she gets rewarded:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shu\"t Maharil Hachadashos # 45</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודווקא המלמד לבתו אבל היא שלמדה בעצמה יש לה שכר כאינה מצוה ועושה שהיא\n  מכוונת לטוב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Joshua Falk</a>, picking up on the words שרוב נשים אין דעתם מכוונת להתלמד ומוציאין דברי תורה לדברי הבאי, explains that a father cannot teach his daughter because she might be of the majority of women for whom learning Torah has negative consequences. But if a woman learns herself, she shows that she is not part of that majority and she gets rewarded for learning:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6224\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Perisha 246:15</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אם למדה לעצמה אנו רואין שיצאה מהרוב ולכך כתב לעיל שיש לה שכר\n  ורצונו לומר אם למדה התורה על מכונה שאינה מוציאה לדברי הבאי אבל האב\n  אינו רשאי ללמדה דדילמא תוציא דבריה לדברי הבאי כי הוא אינו יודע מה\n  שבלבה וק\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another similar exception is formulated by R. Samuel Ben Elchanan Jacob. He suggests that the rabbinic objection to female study was in a situation where young girls are taught Torah. However, it is okay for a woman to choose to study Torah:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24913&st=&pgnum=85\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Shu\"t Mayan Ganim 5:10</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אפשר לחלק שחכמים ז\"ל לא דברו אלא כשהאב מלמדה בקטנותה שגם במעלליה\n  תתנגר אם זך ואם ישר פעלה דודאי כי האי גוונא איכא למיחש שרוב הנשים דעתן\n  קלות כלות זמנן בדברי הבאי וכרובן כן חטאו מקוצר רוח אמנם הנשים אשר נדבה\n  לבן אותנה לקרבה אל המלכה המלוכ' מלאכת ה' מצד בחירתן בטוב במה שהוא טוב\n  הן הנה תעלן בהר ה' תשכונה במקום קדשו כי נשי מופ' הנה ועל חכני דורן\n  להדרן לאדרן לסדרן לחזק ידיהן לאמץ זרועותיהן לחגור מתניהן לאזור חלציהן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A final important exception is that virtually everyone agreed that women must study the laws that pertain to them. This is most famously codified by R. Moses Isserles:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6715\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 246:6</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ\"מ חייבת האשה ללמוד דינים השייכים לאשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This leads to the argument that one cannot properly understand the actual laws without the background discussions of the topics in the Oral Law, primarily the Talmud (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the inherent exceptions to the law, in more contemporary times a number of leading rabbinic figures have advocated that due to changing circumstances we need to change the policy as well. This most famously began with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Meir_Kagan\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Israel Meir Kagan</a> arguing that the Mishnah was written in an era when people lived close to their parents and the traditions were strong enough to be absorbed in the home. However, in his time he felt that people no longer lived near their parents and the traditions had weakened, creating an environment in which it was necessary to teach girls Torah, and without Torah study they would abandon Judaism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Likutei Halachos Sotah</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה דכל זה דוקא בזמנים שלפנינו שכל אחד היה דר במקום אבותיו וקבלת\n  האבות היה חזק מאד אצל כל אחד ואחד להתנהג בדרך שדרכו אבותיו וכמאמר\n  הכתוב שאל אביך ויגדך בזה היינו יכולים לומר שלא תלמוד תורה ותסמוך\n  בהנהגה על אבותיה הישרים אבל כעת בעו\"ה שקבלת האבות נתרופף מאוד מאוד וגם\n  מצוי שאינו דר במקום אבותיו כלל ובפרט אותן שמרגילין עצמן ללמוד כתב\n  ולשון העמים בודאי מצוה רבה ללמדם חומש וגם נביאים וכתובים ומוסרי חז\"ל\n  כגון מסכת אבות וספר מנורת המאור וכדומה כדי שיתאמת אצלם ענין אמונתינו\n  הקדושה דאל\"ה עלול שיסורו מדרך ד' ויעברו על כל יסודי הדת ח\"ו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, despite this line of reasoning, he did not take it to the fullest conclusion and recommend Talmud study. (While he did not specifically forbid Talmud study) He only recommended the Written Law and very limited parts of the Oral Law.</p>\n\n<p>Several decades later, though, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik</a> took the argument further and advocated Talmud study for girls. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_Schachter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Hershel Schachter</a> records R. Soloveitchik as saying that even if teaching girls was a biblical prohibition, we would have to allow it nowadays because now that women are on par with men in other fields of study they will not keep the Torah if they are not allowed to understand it from the source in Scripture and Talmud. He also pointed out (similar to R. Kagan's point) that in prior times women could learn everything they needed to know from observing their mothers in the kitchen, but in today's technological society that is no longer possible, and if we don't teach them the foundations of the Torah from the Chumash and Talmud we might be in danger of losing true Judaism:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mipininei Harav p. 167 (p.214 in the newer edition):</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פעם אחת נסעתי יחד עם הרב זצ\"ל מבוסטון לישיבה (בניו יורק).... אז סיפר\n  לי הרב דאפילו אם היה אסור מן התורה ללמד תורה שבעל פה לנשים היום בתקופה\n  שנשים שוות לאנשים הן באקדמיה והן במדיניות והנשים לא יסכימו להתנהג לפי\n  התורה אם הענין לא יהיה מובן להן ממקורו במקרא ובגמרא מוכרחים אנו להתיר\n  להן ללמוד תורה שבעל פה סוף הדבר כמו שהרמב\"ם בעיתו מזכיר בהקדמתו למשנה\n  תורה שלו שרבנו הקדוש תיקן כתיבת המשנה והתורה שבעל פה בכתב \"כדי שלא\n  תשתכח תורה שבעל פה מישראל\" כן תקן רבנו יוסף דוב הלוי זצ\"ל שאנו\n  מחוייבים ללמד תורה שבעל פה לנשים הרב המשיך לבאר לי שבימים הקדמונים\n  נערה רק הצטרכה להסתכל בהנהגת האם במטבח ובבית בכל יום ובשבת ובפסח לדעת\n  איך להתנהג לפי התורה הלכה למעשה היום הסביר הרב יש בעיות מסובכות\n  המופיעות בכל יום בעולם הטכני שלנו ואם בנות לא ילמדו יסודות התורה מן\n  החומש ומן הגמרא עם פירושי הראשונים אז ח\"ו תפסיק היהדות האמיתית שלנו\n  הגענו לזמן ש\"נשים באות לשמע\" ואז יתגשם ויתקיים סוף הפסוק (הכתוב בפרשת\n  הקהל) \"ושמרו לעשות את כל דברי התורה הזאת\" [מתוך מאמרו של דודי הרמ\"א\n  מאזעסאן שיחי' בהדרום אלול תשנ\"ח עמ' ס\"ה-ס\"ו והשוה דרשת רבנו שנדפסה\n  בבית יוסף שאול חוברת ד' עמ' פ\"ג-פ\"ד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Soloveitchik also wrote two letters to R. Leonard Rosenfeld (the second one was cited by Curiouser <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7074/13438\">above</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=p611GgXAUdMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=community%20covenant%20and%20commitment&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir3bWw1dbbAhVGwVkKHRxzB70Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=community%20covenant%20and%20commitment&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Community Covenant and Commitment</a></em> p.81</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dear Rabbi Rosenfeld,</p>\n  \n  <p>I acknowledge receipt of your letter.

Since such an official\n  assurance has been withheld (your letter did not contain any such\n  commitment) I must decline to consider the controversial problem. The\n  reason for my reluctance to engage in this controversial issue is the\n  unique stand taken by many of our Jews on matters of Law and\n  tradition. We have reached a stage at which party lines and political\n  ideologies influence our halakhic thinking to the extent that people\n  cannot rise above partisan issue to the level of Halakhah-objectivity.\n  Some are in a perennial quest for “liberalization” of the Law and its\n  subordination to the majority opinion of a political legislative body,\n  while others would like to see the Halakhah fossilized and completely\n  shut out of life.

The\n  delay was due to my overcrowded schedule. As to your question with\n  regard to a curriculum in a coeducational school, I expressed my\n  opinion to you long ago that it would be a very regrettable oversight\n  on our part if we were to arrange separate Hebrew courses for girls.\n  Not only is the teaching of Torah she-be-al peh to girls permissible\n  but it is nowadays an absolute imperative. This policy of\n  discrimination between the sexes as to subject matter and method of\n  instruction which is still advocated by certain groups within our\n  Orthodox community has contributed greatly to the deterioration and\n  downfall of traditional Judaism. Boys and girls alike should be\n  introduced to the inner halls of Torah she-be-al peh.</p>\n  \n  <p>I hope to prepare in the near future a halakhic brief on the same\n  problem which will exhaust the various aspects of the same. In the\n  meantime I heartily endorse a uniform program for the entire student\n  body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, R. David Holzer records a similar response from R. Soloveitchik as well as another argument that he advanced, based on the fact that women are certainly no worse than converts:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2qtAAQAAIAAJ&dq=the%20rav%20thinking%20aloud&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=giyoress\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Rav Thinking Aloud p. 121</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>[DH:] Can women learn Torah she'bal peh?</em></p>\n  \n  <p>Yes. You can't really understand <em>chumash</em> or <em>hashkafas ha'yahadus</em>\n  without the interpretation and analysis of <em>Torah she'bal peh</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>[DH:] How do you explain \"כל המלמד בתו תורה (כאלו) לומדה תפלות\"?</em></p>\n  \n  <p>Women also have to have the concept of <em>mesorah</em>. In the days of\n  <em>Chazal</em>, women got the <em>mesorah</em> through osmosis without formal learning, so there was no <em>chiyuv</em> for formal learning. It was based\n  on \"שמע בני מוסר אביך ואל תטש תורת אמך\". Today when our <em>mesoros</em> are\n  weak and they cannot get it through osmosis, they still have two\n  <em>chiyuvim</em>, to know the <em>halachos</em>, to know what to do ללמוד לעשות; and the love of <em>Torah she'bal peh</em> so they can pass it on to their\n  children.</p>\n  \n  <p>The proof is from a <em>giyoress</em>, who must be taught <em>ikarei ha'das</em>\n  including <em>mussar</em> and <em>hashkafas ha'chaim</em>. Our daughters today are\n  certainly no worse than <em>geirim</em>, who need <em>limud</em>. Why would Rashi\n  and Ramban be OK, but gemara not? They're all <em>Torah she'bal peh</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another argument advanced by R. Soloveitchik is recorded by R. Moshe S. Gorelik:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=-dfXAAAAMAAJ&dq=memories%20of%20a%20giant%20%20reflections%20on%20rabbi%20dr.%20joseph%20b.%20soloveitchik%20zt%22l&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=incumbent\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong><em>Memories of a Giant</em> p. 181</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I once heard him [R. Soloveitchik] declare that since women are\n  obligated to study <em>mitzvos</em> which are incumbent upon them, then much\n  of the Talmud is required for study.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another authority to advocate that the changing times require  women's Talmud study was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Amital\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yehuda Amital</a>. R. Reuven Ziegler records the following story:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/0081-0088.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Tradition</em> 43:3 p.81</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1995, I was present when R. Amital told a gathering of the kollel\n  that he did not feel women needed to study Talmud; his grandmother and\n  mother had been very pious Jews without it. A year or two later, he\n  addressed a women’s learning program with the words, “You know, I used\n  to think that Talmud study for women was unnecessary, but now I think\n  it is absolutely essential!” Soon afterwards, Yeshivat Har Etzion\n  decided to open a women’s division in Migdal Oz, where Talmud study is\n  a major part of the curriculum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A final argument is that there can't have been a full-blown prohibition on women studying the Oral Law, because we find that throughout history there have always been individual learned women. R. Yissaschar Tamar in his commentary (Alei Tamar) to the passage in the Jerusalem Talmud lists off a dozen or so such women.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Hachinuch</a> in discussing the prohibition of issuing a halachic ruling while drunk, says that this prohibition also applies to women who are capable of ruling: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer Hachinuch # 152</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונוהג איסור ביאת מקדש בשכרות בזמן הבית בזכרים ונקבות ומניעת ההוראה בכל\n  מקום ובכל זמן בזכרים וכן באשה חכמה הראויה להורות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As it is inconceivable that someone could rule without ever studying Talmud, this indicates that it is at least possible for individual women to study Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>However, other authorities have argued that the ban on women's Talmudic studies is still in force. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Teitelbaum\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Joel Teitelbaum</a> referred to those who cite R. Kagan's statement as permitting that which the Sages forbade as idiots. He argues that the law can never change, and R. Kagan only mentioned areas of study that were not formally prohibited, but merely customarily not studied by women. But areas of study that were formally prohibited to women (including Talmud and even Rashi's commentary to Chumash) are still absolutely forbidden:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vayoel Moshe 3:48</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש טפשים התולים בדברי החפץ חיים ז\"ל שכתב בס' ליקוטי הלכות שלו במס'\n  סוטה בהלכות האלו שאסור ללמד תורה לנשים והביא פרטי הדינים ונכתב בצדו\n  ונראה דכ\"ז בזמנים שלפנינו וכו' שקבלת האבות הי' חזק מאוד וכו' היינו\n  יכולים לומר שלא תלמוד תורה ותסמוך בהנהגה על אבותי' הישרים אבל כעת\n  בעו\"ה שקבלת האבות נתרופף מאוד מאוד וכו' מצוה רבה ללמדם חומש וגם נביאים\n  וכתובים ומוסרי חכז\"ל וכו' כדי שיתאמת אצלם ענין אמונתנו הקדושה וכו'\n  והנה תלו סוקי סרוקי והוצאת שם רע על אותו צדיק כאילו ח\"ו אמר על הלכה\n  פסוקה שהוא מן הש\"ס והראשונים והשו\"ע שאינו נוהג בזמננו וח\"ו לעקור הלכה\n  פסוקה אבל עינים להם ולא יראו מ\"ש ללמדם חומש ונו\"כ ומוסרי חז\"ל וכל אלה\n  שחשב אין בהם איסור מצד הדין כמו שנתבאר לעיל אלא שבכמה דורות נהגו\n  סילסול שלא ללמד לנשים כלל והי' בזה טעמים או חששו שלא יומשך עי\"ז ללמדם\n  אח האסור להם ולכן סמכו בכל מה שצריכות לידע על קבלת האבות כמו שנראה\n  מדברי המהרי\"ל וע\"ז כתב שלפי מצב הדור שנתרופף הקבלה וא\"א לסמוך על קבלת\n  האבות מצוה ללמדם את המותר ללמוד עמהם מצד הדין אלא שהיו נמנעים לכתחילה\n  בדורות שלפנהו אבל לא להתיר ח\"ו את האסור מדינא ובמה שאמרו חכז\"ל דהוי\n  כמלמדה תיפלות ק\"ו ב\"ב של ק\"ו בדורינו החלש שמזיק יותר יען שנתרופף דרך\n  האבות והנה כתב ללמדם חומש אבל לא כתב עם פירש\"י ז\"ל שזה ודאי איסור גמור\n  ללמדם כי דברי רש\"י ז\"ל הן הן גופי תורה ועומק דרשת חז\"ל דהוי ודאי בכלל\n  מה שאמרו חכז\"ל שהוא כמלמדה תיפלות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Weinberg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Weinberg</a> also strongly objected to women studying Talmud nowadays, and went so far as to say that it would be better for schools to not teach Talmud to boys either rather than teach Talmud to girls:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=4w4mAQAAIAAJ&dq=rav%20yaakov%20weinberg%20talks%20about%20chinuch&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=b%27ezer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Yaakov Weinberg Talks About Chinuch p. 126</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In terms of the specific question that was asked, if I had to answer\n  it, I would say that it is better that boys never see a Gemara than to\n  teach it to the boys and girls together. It is far, far better. The\n  boys will survive not having seen a Gemara. <em>B'ezer Hashem Yisbarach</em>,\n  they will come to a yeshivah and will start learning it, with a\n  certain handicap, of course. They would have been able to do better if\n  they had seen a Gemara, but they will survive. But teaching girls\n  Gemara – that they will not survive. If you have to make a choice of\n  either not teaching the boys and the girls or of teaching both, make\n  the choice of teaching neither. You will be much better off in terms\n  of building <em>Yiddishe neshamos</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>In sum</h2>\n\n<p>Most classical authorities codified a rule that women should not be taught Talmud. There were a number of possible exceptions to this rule, and especially in recent times  a number of authorities have argued in favor of Talmud studies, while others maintain their strong objections. In contemporary practice there is a wide range within Orthodox Judaism. The more \"modern\" groups encourage women Talmud studies, and teach it in their schools. The average \"yeshivish/chareidi\" groups for the most part discourage it and do not teach it in their schools, but they probably wouldn't stop an individual girl from studying. The more intense yeshivish/chareidi, including many Hasidic groups, outright forbid it. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1.

    "content": "# Disparity between male and female pronunciation of Cholam\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many Yeshivish communities in the US, the male segment of the population vocalizes the <em>cholam</em> as \"oi,\" while their female counterparts vocalize it as a long \"o\". How did this come about? Does the same phenomenon exist in countries other than the US? And is there any historical precedent for this kind of disparity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A few notes which may be enlightening: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My grandfather, the first student to be enrolled in Parochial School of Baltimore in 1917, (later to become Talmudical Academy) son of a Latvian Habad Hasid, learned under Rav Samson, Rav Sheftel Kramer, and Rav Ruderman, pronounced the <em>cholam</em> as an \"o\".</li>\n<li>The pronunciation amongst many Yeshivah bochurim prior to the influx of refugees from Europe after WW II and prior to the Hungarian Revolution was \"o\". </li>\n<li>The pronunciation of Lithuanian non-Hasidim was somewhere between an \"o\" and a long \"a\".</li>\n<li>The founders of the Bais Yaakov movement in America learned in the Cracow Teachers' Seminary, founded by <strong>Frau</strong> Sara Schenirer. There was at least one very influential architect of that Seminary and the movement it started who was of German extraction: Rabbi Dr. Leo Deuschtlander. They could have pronounced it \"o\" due to his (and others') influence.</li>\n<li>Boys' Yeshivos even in Lithuania had a minor constituency of students from countries that pronounced it as \"oi\".</li>\n<li>I have not seen it inside, but I have seen it quoted by reliable second-hand sources that the GR\"A held that the proper pronunciation for the <em>cholam</em> is a <em>Kametz</em> and a <em>shooruk</em> in succession, which results in an \"o\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A few points:</p>\n\n<p>1) The 'oy' is linked to Yiddish.  Like English, Yiddish underwent a major vowel shift, the full result of which is seen in Chassidishe Hebrew.  I don't have the books available, but I believe the books written by any of the Weinreichs regarding Yiddish discuss this in detail.  I'm pretty sure the /oy/ is linked to that vowel shift in some form.</p>\n\n<p>If you keep in mind the fact that Chassidim had a massive affect on the Yeshiva world post-WWII, it shouldn't come as a surprise if they influenced the entire Ashkenazi world's pronunciation, with the exception of the MO and German traditions, who have roughly similar pronunciations.  As for the source, it wouldn't surprise me if the /oy/ came from there or from communities where knowledge of Hebrew grammar and correct pronunciation wasn't emphasized.</p>\n\n<p>2) Based on a Yekkishe siddur that I downloaded recently, the /oy/ seems to be a Polish pronunciation, while the Litvish communities said something akin to /ay/ and everyone else saying something between /o/, /au/ and /ou/.  Another plausible explanation.</p>\n\n<p>3) Bais Yaakov schools were essentially a girl's version of the Hildesheimer Yeshiva.  Because of that, the fact that Sarah Schenirer the founder spent a lengthy period of time in a German community, and the fact that their Posek was of German extraction - as stated above - it makes sense that Bais Yaakov schools would use the older Mesorah from Germany. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't recall witnessing this phenomenon myself, but my guess is that in the Yeshivish community men are much more likely than women to override the pronunciation they learned at home with what they are exposed to in Yeshiva. Many yeshivot nowadays tend to promote uniformity of dress, and I suspect, halachic practice and pronunciation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why Are These Double Parshiyos?",
    "content": "# Why Are These Double Parshiyos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During a regular (non-leap) Jewish year, there are four instances where two of the weekly Torah portions are read together in the same week. This is because there are not enough weeks to read all of the portions separately (especially because we do not read a weekly portion during Shabbos of Pesach and Sukkos).\nWhy were those eight specific portions chosen for doubling?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Parshoyos that are sometimes doubled are: Vayakhel-Pekudei, Tazria-Metzora, Acharei-Kedoshim, Behar-Bechukosai, Chukas-Balak, Matos-Masai, Nitzovim-Vayelech.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=31b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megila 31b</a> says that Ezra established that the curses of Chumash Vayikra should be read before Shavuos and the curses of Chumash Devarim should be read prior to Rosh Hashana.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=2&hilchos=7&perek=13&halocha=2&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tefila 13:2</a> mentions that the Minhag is to read Bamidbar before Shavuos, Veschannan after Tisha B'Av, Nitzavim before Rosh Hashana, and on a year with one Adar - Tzav before Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>Although there may be other reasons - it seems that the Parshios selected are more connected in content than the others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am expanding on Gershon's answer so that you can see things more clearly.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemarah Megillah dictates a large part of the calendar on its own. Here's how:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"the curses of Chumash Vayikra should be read before Shavuos\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explains why there is a \"burst\" of doubled portions between Pesach and Shavuot during a non-leap year. Three of four weeks during Sefira are doubled portions. If the last day of Pesach occurs on Shabbat in Diaspora, in a non-leap year, Behar-Behukotai is separated in Israel. (I have stated this in \"reverse\" intentionally, b/c usually in a non-leap year, we expect these two to be doubled everywhere. However, in this scenario, Israel is 1 week ahead of Diaspora.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>V'eschannan after Tisha B'Av</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is mentioned by Ramba\"m, and I have to see if he or a commentary mentions a reason as to why this is important, as it' snot mentioned in the Gemarra. Doing this explains why Matot and Mas'ei are almost always doubled. There are a few rare exceptions when they are separate. Separation occurs only in a leap year when Pesach occurred on Sunday or it is a <em>maleh</em> leap year with Pesach being on Tuesday. In Israel, it can also occur when Pesach started on Shabbat, as you will see next year (5779).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the curses of Chumash Devarim should be read prior to Rosh Hashana</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, this rule is \"superseded\" by Rambam's </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nitzavim before Rosh Hashana</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>because <em>Ki Tavo</em> is always read <strong>two</strong> weeks before Rosh Hashanna; never immediately before. (I don't know why.)</p>\n\n<p>Netzavim is paired with Vayelech when either Rosh Hashanna or Yom Kippur occur on Shabbat. This is easy to understand why. When neither occur on Shabbat, as in this year, there is an extra SHabbat between Yom Kippur and Succot available to read Ha'azinu, otherwise, Ha'azinu is read on Shabbat Shuva.</p>\n\n<p>(Vayelech has the anomaly of being read either 0, 1 or 2 times within the same Hebrew year.)</p>\n\n<p>As for why those specific parshiot were chosen for doubling, Gershon is correct that they tend to have similar content. But, that is part of the story. <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/vol%202%20epstein.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This lengthy article</a> explains that much of the doubling has to do with parsha \"size management\".  As a Torah reader, after I read this article, I walked away still shaking my head wondering about how well they really \"managed\" this. Matot / Mas'ei is a 4-water-bottle-sipping double!</p>\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9101&st=&pgnum=90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch haShulchan 271:5</a> rejects the idea that women should not cover men, limiting it to public venues (b'tzibur).</p>\n\n<p>That said, I once went to someones house where the woman made hamotzi.  It rubbed me the wrong way.  Since the custom has been for the man to do kiddush, it seemed like they were making a statement that should be outside the Jewish purview.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I went to a family for Shabbos lunch who are much more modern than I am, and the wife made Hamotzi. I quickly went through the Halachos in my head (I knew the Mishna Berurah about woman making Kiddush for husbands, but not other people), and I decided that although it may be technically allowed, I was not happy to fulfill my obligation through her, and so I made a Beracha under my breath when the Challah came around. (Furthermore, the woman was wearing a head covering and was not covering her arms).</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, I asked my Rav, a prominent and renowned Dayan, and he told me similar. He said that although it may be technically allowed, nowadays women are doing this for feminist reason, to prove men and women are equal. This is antithetical to the Torah, which believes that men and women have different roles to play in this world, as Rav Kook explains in Oros Hakodesh (Volume 2, Page 439). The problem is not so much a halachik one as a hashkofic one. My Rav was very upset how people do this to make a statement and that Chazal did not view the world like that. The accepted practice is that the man always says Hamotzi and that is what we should do.</p>\n\n<p>(Also, see the Kaf Hachaim [271, 8] who quotes the Marharshal, Bach and Kenneses Hagdolah who pasken that tradition has determined that women are never motzi men with berachos, not even their own husband. This is even stricter than the Mishna Berurah quoted in above answers.</p>\n\n\n",

Stand up when they're standing, sit when they're sitting. You might want to compare, for instance, questions of a fellow whose practice differs from the congregation's with regards to tefillin on Chol HaMoed, or an Israeli visiting America on the second day of YomTov. (On the former, for instance, if everyone in the shul is wearing tefilin and one person isn't, that's not demonstrating a conflict; maybe that one person just has severe digestive problems and may need to excuse himself any minute now.)</p>\n\n<p>I know of one fellow whose practice was to say <em>Tachanun</em> (the extra-sad prayer) who arrived at a shul that was saying <em>Hallel</em> (extra-happy prayer). He stood when they stood and just said his sad prayer, no one noticed what page he was on or exactly what words he was saying to himself. Meanwhile, another fellow at that shul felt like making a public statement that his opinion was to say <em>neither</em> the happy prayer nor the sad one; he made a very clear point of getting up from his seat and going to sit and read some <em>Tanach</em> for a few minutes. That generated friction with his fellow congregants -- do you really need to go there?</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, whatever your view on how to observe Israeli Independence Day in a religious manner, you'll probably have some range on what other views are \"valid\", which would affect how you'd behave when surrounded by others whose practice is different than yours. Many, for instance, find Hallel without a bracha, after the davening, unobjectionable as you're just saying some extra Psalms (once your formal text of prayers are over, sure say whatever Psalms you like, any day you like, why not?).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>you should look for a minian that do it like you.</p>\n\n<p>I heard that the rav of shemuel hanavi (the neighborhood) goes to a dierent minian on this day just because of that, looks like his kehila does halel and he doesn't, so he goes to another minian</p>\n\n<p>bigger problem would be a bahur ieshiva, since he needs to pray in the ieshiva.\nI saw people that because of that go home, or make themselves a bigger weekend and go back after.\nbut this is no solution for overseas students.</p>\n\n<p>I asked my rav once about someone that wants to say halel on a minian that doesn't: he should say it after finishing shaharit, quietly he doesn't need to show off what he is doing.</p>\n\n<p>I would say that someone that wants to say tahanun just do it quietly, he can finish his prayers alone.</p>\n\n<p>As a personal example, I usually pray minha with a minian that doesn't do tahanun on minha ever, I simply do it alone</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If the minyan says hallel, say it along with them.

However I've noticed that images of angels are not very widespread in Judaism (at least compared to my impressions of their scope in Christianity). Can someone explain why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>Judaism believes in angels, but one is not permitted to pray to an angel or any intermediary. (According to Rambam and Ramban, praying to angels is idolatrous. Others may be more lenient.)  Images of angels may also be problematic in certain cases.<br>\nAlthough \"Shalom Alechem\" is a widespread custom, there are some people who refrain from saying some (or even all) of it, because it is too close to praying to angels. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Your father is an outlier.  Angels are undisputedly an integral part of Jewish theology.</p>\n\n<p>By way of proof, see Genesis 32:4, in which Jacob sends angels to his brother Esau.  Lest you think that \"mal'achim\" (מלאכים) there means \"messengers\", Rash\"i (the pre-eminent commentary on the 5 Books of Moses) there states clearly, \"מלאכים ממש\" - <strong>real angels</strong>.  The Torah is replete with other interactions between men and angels, e.g. Abraham (Genesis 18), Lot (Genesis 19), Bil'am (Numbers 22).  The list is practically endless.</p>\n\n<p>That answers your first 2 questions.  As to the third, there is a specific commandment not to make images of angels in the 10 commandments: \"You shall not make yourselves a carved image or any likeness of that which is in the heavens above...\" (Exodus 20:4).  A \"carved image\" (פסל) is a 3-dimensional sculpture; a \"likeness\" (תמונה) is any other representation, including drawings or paintings.  That is why you don't find angels represented in Jewish art.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is really no such thing as an icon in Judaism.  Icons are objects of veneration in some Christian confessions, especially in Eastern Orthodox Christianity.  Judaism, on the other hand, expressly forbids any form of worship of images or statues.</p>\n\n<p>Jews are not forbidden to create images, and angels are present in Jewish art.  Such images simply do not play the same role in Judaism, as they do in Christianity.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why no Talmud Bavli on Zeraim or Taharot?",
    "content": "# Why no Talmud Bavli on Zeraim or Taharot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The common reason given as to why there is no Talmud Bavli on most of Seder Zeraim or Seder Taharot (only the tractates of Berachot and Niddah are represented) is that the Amoraim were based in Bavel (Babylonia) and lived after the time of the destruction of the Temple. Therefore, the laws pertaining to the agriculture and land of Israel (Zeraim) did not apply, and neither did the laws of ritual purity (Taharot). Yet almost all of Kodashim has Talmud Bavli on it; the Amoraim clearly discussed Zevachim, Menachot, etc. even though there was no Temple. Now I am aware of the verse that says \"U'Nshalma Parim S'fateinu,\" indicating a special concept of reward for discussing and studying sacrifices, even when they can't be brought (i.e. since there is no longer a Temple). However, we also are rewarded for studying laws that no longer apply like Zeraim and Taharot, so why did the Amoraim not discuss them the way they did Kodashim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I think the answer to this lies in the Talmud's origins. It presents itself as a series of discussions, but it wasn't as if Abaye and Rava were having an argument while someone took notes. What really happened was that  the positions of the Tannaim and Amaraim were incorporated within lectures given in Babylonian yeshivot and programs like <em>yarchei kallah</em>. These lectures followed the Mishna, but they didn't necessarily cover all the Mishna - just like today, different programs or academies would have a study cycle that covered different bits of it. The source material was transmitted and refined over literally hundreds of years until it became a huge, dense corpus of discussions that was the basis for the Talmud. It was eventually redacted (by the <em>Savaraim</em>) and that's the Talmud we have today.</p>\n\n<p>So why is there no Talmud on most of <em>Taharot</em>? Well, recall the Talmud's origins - it documented the course of study in the Babylonian academies. If there were no courses on a chapter of the Mishna there would be nothing to be redacted, and if there only a few courses the material may have been too brief to justify its own tractate and been included elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>I realise that this answer just pushes the question back a step - why were there courses on most of <em>Kodshim</em> and not on <em>Parah</em>? I suspect it was a snowball effect that started because there was initially more demand for courses on particular tractates. This created a corpus of material on the tractates that had been studied, which justified further courses and eventually led to this material being redacted in separate tractates.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, this very likely explains the <em>mesechtot ketanot</em> like <em>Sofrim</em> and <em>Semachot</em>: they contain material that was treated separately by only some yeshivot, so you end up with specialised tractates even though a lot of the discussion is included elsewhere in the Talmud. So from the fact that there is no masechta <em>Parah</em> we can surmises that there was no regular course of study on it. On the other hand, there was so much material on <em>Nezikin</em> that it had to be split into three courses (First Gate, Second Gate, Third Gate). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simplest reason is that the main topic matters of Zeraim and Taharot are only pertinent to those who live in the land of Israel. Zeraim (apart from Berachot, which is included in the Bavli) deals with agricultural laws, all of which are primarily relevant for those residing in Israel. Taharot (aside from Niddah, which is included in the Bavli) also only really mattered in Israel, especially when the Beit haMikdash (temple) was still standing. Thus, (as Joe points out), the bulk of Zeraim and Taharot were not taught as units in Bavel (as opposed to the academies in Israel, the discussions of which became the source material for the Talmud Yerushalmi). </p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that mishnayot and beraytot from Zeraim and Taharot are quoted throughout the Talmud Bavli, whenever they are needed as related material for discussions germane to the topic at hand.</p>\n\n\n",

But assuming the conversion is valid, the Bible warns against mistreating the convert (as someone who is lonely and vulnerable); unfortunately, different converts have had very different experiences in different Jewish communities.  A good description of it can be found <a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2011/03/the-convert-problem/\">here</a>. Some converts have had the experience of being accepted and have blended in with little difficulties; others feel ignored or worse. This is often more about sociology than religion, and the personality of the local community; the convert's personality, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and (unfortunately) race can all play a role.</p></li>\n<li>There are a handful of ways a convert is treated slightly differently than a native-born Jew:\n<ul>\n<li>A female convert may not marry a Cohen (a man descended from the Jewish priestly family)</li>\n<li>The <em>ketubah</em> document at a female convert's wedding will identify her as \"so-and-so, the daughter of Abraham; a convert\"</li>\n<li>A convert is identified in Jewish documents as \"the son of Abraham\" or \"the daughter of Sarah.\"</li>\n<li>The daughter of two converts should ideally not marry a Cohen.</li>\n<li>Certain functions of serving on an ecclesiastical court, though all major rabbinic programs that I know of will accept and ordain converts.</li>\n<li>The Bible describes ancestral portions in the land of Israel (which has not been observed for a very, very long time); in theory a convert would not have one.

The dangers of conversion in many Christian and Muslim countries may be why conversion came to be discouraged, although today this tends to be done by simply requiring converts to undertake an extensive period of study. </p>\n\n<p>The classic scriptural support for conversion is the Book of Ruth, which recounts the story of a Moabite woman whose physical and spiritual journey led to her marriage to Boaz and becoming one of the ancestors of King David. Conversion is generally treated very positively in Jewish texts such as the Talmud, although there is a famous quotation that \"converts are as difficult for the Jews as thorns.\" There are various apologia for not taking this literally; in fact there is a specific Jewish prohibition on oppressing converts.

Turns out that this is not only a double-edged sword (i.e. the 1/60 illness doesn't just go away, but sticks to the visitor instead!) but also this only applies to someone of the same mazal (\"ben gilo\") as the choleh!</p>\n\n<p>So we checked out the halacha in the Rambam.  Here's what he has to say (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Mourning.14.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Avel 14:6</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל המבקר את החולה, כאילו נטל חלק\n  מחולייו, והקל מעליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hello?  What happened to \"ben gilo\"?  Is this Rambam's rationalist way of seeing things, that he summarily changed the pshat from the gemara?  The Shulchan Aruch likewise rules like the Rambam, that this healing effect of bikkur cholim applies to everyone.  And I haven't found anyone (though my research has been far from exhaustive) who disagrees, or mentions a word about \"ben gilo\" in the halacha!</p>\n\n<p>So how did this concept from the gemara get struck from the record when it came to halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>You're not mistaken: in fact the Tur and Shulkhan Arukh (335:2) say that only a בן גילו has the ability to take some of the sickness with him. This difficulty was recognised by the Drisha on Ramba\"m and he stresses Ramba\"m's wording: <strong>כאילו</strong> נטל חלק מחולייו - it is <strong>as if</strong> he takes part of the illness. However, there's a note in my Ramba\"m that directed me to Midrash Rabbah Vayikra 34:1.</p>\n\n<p>R' Huna says: [Tehilim 41:2] talks about someone who visits an invalid. As R' Huna says, everyone who visits a sick person removes one sixtieth of the invalid's illness. They challenged R' Huna : if so, why not have sixty people visit the invalid, then he can go shopping with them (i.e., then the invalid will be well again)? [R' Huna] replied, sixty - but only if they love him as they love themselves. Still, it <strong>will</strong> make him feel better.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems to me that Ramba\"m was aware that the Gemara restricts the healing power of visitors to a בן גילו, but he chose to emphasise the fact that all visitors make the invalid <strong>feel</strong> better, and he followed R' Huna in the Midrash by tying it to the mystical idea of the בן גילו. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The main Gemara is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l33.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 39b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי אחא בר חנינא כל המבקר חולה נוטל אחד מששים בצערו אמרי ליה אם כן ליעלון שיתין ולוקמוה אמר ליה כעישורייתא דבי רבי ובבן גילו</p>\n<p>Said Rabbi Acha Bar Chanina: anyone who visits the sick takes away 1/60th of their pain. [The rabbis] responded to him: \"if so, couldn't we just bring sixty people in, and boom he'd get better\"? He replied: each only takes 1/60th of the existing, not original pain [so 60 people would leave him with (59/60)^60 = 36% of his original pain]; and this only works if the visitor is <em>ben gilo</em>, someone with their karma properly attuned (whatever that means).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My strong suspicion here, off the top of my head; is there are two things going on here. Firstly, the spirit of Rav Acha's statement stands -- each visitor helps somewhat; it's that spirit that the Rambam conveys. The Gemara had challenged if this was an absolute, sure-fire cure mechanism, to which Rav Acha attached some significant limitations.</p>\n\n\n",

During the time of the temple, a Cohen would have to provide documentary evidence of their ancestry in order to serve in the temple (כהן מיוחס). Since the Babylonian exile, all such documentary evidence has been lost (with the exception of perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol15/v15n020.shtml#09\">Rappaport</a> family). Some interesting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Aaron\">genetic studies</a> have also been done relating to the shared ancestry of Cohanim. Today halachically, anyone who claims to have a tradition as being a Cohen or Levi is accepted as one, for the sake of the privileges such a role entails (like getting the first or second aliyah, being able to give the priestly blessing).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from Cohanim and Levi'im, there are many people who have family traditions that relate them back to Kind David (placing them in the tribe of Judah). These usually consist of direct family trees going back to a Jewish sage (rishon or achron) who lived some time in the last thousand years, and who have been related back to King David (for example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi#Birth_and_early_life\">Rashi</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David#Descendants_of_David\">others</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that, no one can claim with even a small degree of certainty to which tribe they are descended from (assuming patrilineal descent). After the exile of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Lost_Tribes\">10 Lost Tribes</a>\" into the Assyrian empire, there were either 3 or 4 tribes left - Levi, Judah, Binyamin and probably Shimon.

The only tribes that were not lost were Judah and Benjamin (and the Levites and Cohanim who lived in their territories).  Benjamin was very small numerically, compared to Judah, so pretty much every Jew alive today who is not a Cohen or Levi is probably from the tribe of Judah.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, it's very difficult to \"prove\" any such genealogical claims; anybody could invent a family tree proving their descent from pretty much anyone they choose.  We really just rely on people's good faith when they claim to be a Cohen or Levi, but there are practical halachic rulings that effectively acknowledge the difficulty in proving genealogy.  For example <em>maaser rishon</em> (the first tithe, 10% of produce grown in Israel) should be given to a Levi - but since nobody can prove beyond doubt that they are a Levi, the obligation to give it to a Levi is unenforceable, and the owner himself may keep it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>All Cohanim and Levites are from the tribe of Levi; many people have proof of such lineage.</p>\n\n\n",

It is written in the Torah (Ex. 23:19) \"thou shalt not cook a <em>g'di</em> in its mother's milk\", and by oral tradition [of Biblical force] we learned that this verse prohibits cooking and eating the meat of any mammal, whether domesticated [such as sheep] or wild [such as deer], in milk; but chicken could be cooked and eaten with milk, as far as the Biblical law.</p>\n<p>Should a rabbinic court go and allow wild-mammal meat in milk, they have \"subtracted\"; and if someone prohibits chicken in milk, claiming it was included in the Biblical prohibition on <em>g'di</em>, that would be \"adding.\"</p>\n<p>But if it was stated that: chicken [in milk] was permitted Biblically, but we [the rabbis] shall prohibit it, and inform the people that this is a decree to prevent problems; as people may say \"chicken is okay because the Torah didn't literally say <em>chicken</em>, so it didn't say <em>wild-animal</em> either\"; and the next person will say \"any domesticated mammal is fine too except for goats\", and the next person will say \"goat meat is acceptable in the milk of cows or sheep, as it said <em>its mother's</em>, meaning that same species\"; and the next person will say \"I can cook a goat in goat's milk, as long as it wasn't this particular goat's mother\" ... <em>therefore</em>, we shall prohibit all meat in milk, even chicken. This is not <em>adding</em>, it is creating a protective fence around the Torah. And so too all similar matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Excellent question.  The answer is that the Rabbis themselves are invested by the Torah with the duty to protect the basic halacha - see for example Deuteronomy 17:8-11, where it basically states that we are Scripturally bound to comply with the rulings of the Sanhedrin.  Furthermore see Pirkei Avos 1:1, which states, \"... make a protective fence for the Torah.\"  This means that the Rabbis saw it as their duty to make enactments to protect the central Scriptural commandments, in the same way that one would put up a protective cordon several feet away from an open manhole to make sure that nobody falls in.</p>\n\n<p>Your question still is pertinent - is this not \"adding\" to the Torah?  In order to avoid this problem, it is very important that we have to have a very clear distinction between those laws that are Scripturally mandated, and those that were enacted by the Rabbis.  You will find several practical differences in our approach to Rabbinic mitzvos as opposed to Torah mitzvos; there are a great many leniencies in practical halacha regarding Rabbinic mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are basically 2 types of <em>additions</em> which are allowed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Those that prevent us from accidentally transgressing - as it says in the first Mishna in Pirkei Avot: <em>Make a fence around the Torah</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Those instituted by the Sages and Prophets under the umbrella of \" כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יוֹרֽוּךָ\" - \"you shall do whatever they teach you\" (Devarim 17:10).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that not everything is written in the Torah; the Oral Law has many details missing from the Written Law.

In Pesachim 40b, there is a discussion which says explicitly that Rav Papi allowed servants in the beit Reish Galuta to thicken a tavshil with \"chasisi.\" The Rif says this is matzah meal; Tosafot say it is lentil flour, and Rashi says it is dried flour. Rava says we need to be concerned in a place where the servants are not makpid on the mitzvah and may come to mix in actual flour, instead of the matzah meal. Rava himself did actually stir matzah meal into a tavshil in his own house, and was merely concerned when dealing with servants. The claim, however, that cooked matzah can become chametz gamur lacks halakhic grounding. The Tur, to Orah Hayyim 43, paskens that it is forbidden to cook with matzah meal when servants are around, but this itself doesn't account for the shita to avoid all kinds of matzah sheruya- wet matzah. The Chatam Sofer, Vilna Gaon, and others ate matzoh balls, and the Shulchan Aruch paskens that wet matzah can be eaten by cholim, and even rules that we can wet and rebake matzah. It seems to be based on a teshuva of the Alter Rebbe of Lubavitch, who notes that Rabbeinu Yerucham held that dried/roasted flour (as described as Rashi in Pesachim 40b) can become chametz when mixed with water (not normative halakha at all). Citing the Arizal's position that extra humrot are proper on Pesach, he was makpid on the minority shita and chose to avoid all matzah sheruya. He also notes that in his time, matzohs often had uncooked flour on the surface because people had recently become makpid on 18 minutes. </p>\n\n\n",

The letters on the screen are just light, there is nothing really written there. But what about on a E-reader, like a Kindle or a Nook? For those devices, actual particles form the words. Would one be allowed to erase <em>shemos</em> from them? </p>\n\n<p>(Note: Currently, I don't think these devices display Hebrew text, so it's not yet a common issue.)</p>\n\n<p>How the devices work: \n<a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/15112/how_it_works_lcd_monitors.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LCD Screens</a>(link no longer valid)\n<a href=\"http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/amazon-kindle3.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">E-readers.</a>  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Two possibilities I can think of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strike>The E-ink is not permanent stuff (it disappears as soon as the power is cut, for example). So it might be akin to writing Hashem's name in fruit juice or something similar. In the laws of Shabbos, that is not considered true \"writing\" (though it's still forbidden Rabbinically - see Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 340:4 and Mishnah Berurah there :18 and :22), so possibly - though I haven't found any source to substantiate this - it may not be considered \"writing\" for this purpose either.</strike></p></li>\n<li><p>On these devices, as far as I know, you \"erase\" the words somewhat indirectly (by flipping to the next page, or turning them off, or whatever - but not by doing anything directly to the E-ink particles themselves). Indirect erasure of Hashem's name is not prohibited (Shabbos 120b, cited in Minchas Chinuch 437:14; there is an extensive discussion of the details of this law in the commentaries to Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=65\">Hil. Yesodei Hatorah 6:6</a>).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>In order to answer your question we need to define the scope of the prohibition on erasing G-d's name. It's based on Deuteronomy 12:3-4 וְאִבַּדְתֶּם אֶת־שְׁמָ֔ם, \"and you shall destroy [the idols'] names\", 'לֹֽא־תַעֲשוּן כֵּ֔ן לַה, \"you shall not do the same to G-d\". The extent of the prohibition is discussed in commentators to Shulchan Aruch and Tur 276:9, and Ramba\"m Yesodei haTorah 6, with very wide disagreement - see the Pitchei Teshuva for an analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, we can define a spectrum of \"names\". This certainly includes seven - the Tetragrammaton, E-l and so forth, but it may extend down to things like \"shalom\". Then we can define a spectrum of intent - was it written deliberately, erroneously, or absent-mindedly? Then there's a spectrum of contexts - in a sefer torah, in other parts of tanach, as a verse decorating (e.g.) a cup, or just randomly? The acharonim disagree on all of these. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, let's suppose that for whatever reason you choose to display a PDF on your Kindle that contains the Tetragrammaton. It's a deliberate act involving the most sacred of names; is there a basis for erasing it? The only relevant <a href=\"http://www.halachayomit.co.il/EnglishDisplayRead.asp?readID=1829\">responsum</a> I have found is from R' Ovadia Yosef <em>shlit\"a</em> but this appears to assume the use of CRT or LED displays, which are \"not actual writing, [...] only a combination of various lights and the like\" and which stop displaying the image when the machine is turned off. Neither of these apply to the Kindle.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would take a <em>posek</em> to give a definitive answer, but I suggest that one response might be that even a Kindle doesn't involve an actual change in the electronic ink; it's merely a rearrangement of the small particles within it. This isn't the classic form of writing (which has real ink laid down on a substrate, and which changes the paper or parchment it's written on) and it isn't even like engraving, as no material moves from its place. This being the case, perhaps one can safely rely on the acharonim who only prohibit the erasure of names written as part of a sefer torah and so forth.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I asked a Posek from YU and he said it shouldn't be a problem to read seforim on an E-reader. He didn't explain why, but these are two reasons that one can perhaps be meikel:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Its not really a written text</strong>. Since its just particles floating in some sort of liquid, one can make an argument that it is not a real written word. Even though the text doesn't need continued electric power to stay there, it's still not a real form of writing. </li>\n<li><strong>It wasn't made to be holy, but just to be used temporarily</strong>. Some have used this argument to permit discarding printed Divrei Torah: since they were just meant to be used short-term, they may lose their holiness afterwards. R.M.Feinstein (Ig.Moshe OC IV.39) cites the halacha that requires the burning a  \"Sefer Torah sheKasav min\" to show that intent is necessary to make something holy. This argument is much stronger when applied to an E-reader. The person has no intent to create a lasting holy text, just to read it for a minute. Therefore, there should not be a problem to turn the page. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The biological yeast that we use today for leavening bread is itself not prohibited, but may not be added to any flour mixtures, as it speed the fermentation process and is likely to become <em>chametz</em>. See <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/Passover/BreadWineBeer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In general, fermented products such as alcoholic beverages are permitted on Passover so long as they are not made from the grains we are worried about. Alcohol is not prohibited on Passover. In fact, we are required to drink four cups of wine on the first night at the <em>seder</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Practically speaking, one should only buy and consume products on Passover if they are marked with a legitimate Passover <em>kashrut</em> symbol.</p>\n\n<p>In regard to why we eat unleavened bread, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matza\" rel=\"nofollow\">matzah</a>, on Passover, and what it represents, the <em>mishna</em>, cited famously by the <em>haggada</em>, explains that it symbolizes the haste in which the Jews left Egypt, so much so that they would not even wait for their bread to rise.

The  matza, (unleavened bread), represents the haste of exodus. Commentators expand on this idea. Another idea discussed focuses on chametz. The leavening process is not necessary for nutritional value, but is done just for taste. The bread becomes all swollen up, which is compared to arrogance & the evil inclination. \nAlso, bread was invented in Egypt, so this might have to do with it... </p>\n\n\n",

These principles are pretty much universally accepted as binding in all Orthodox forms of Judaism. Principle number 8 is, \"The belief in the divine origin of the Torah.\" Principle number 9 is, \"The belief in the immutability of the Torah.\"</p>\n\n<p>This being said, it is important to differentiate between the idea of the Torah being perfect as understood in Judaism and the concept of \"Biblical Inerrancy\" as understood by many Christian groups. </p>\n\n<p>Judaism believes that the Torah was revealed in two parts. The written text of the Torah was dictated to Moses exactly as we have it today. Together with this \"Written Torah\", much additional information about each commandment, as well as a complete system of Torah interpretation was was also given to Moses and passed down through the generations. </p>\n\n<p>After the destruction of the Second Holy Temple in 70 CE, a process of collecting and recording these teachings was begun. The teachings of the Oral Torah were eventually codified in the Talmud, Midrash, etc. This process is explained in great detail in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/901698/jewish/Part-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Introduction of the Mishneh Torah</a> by Maimonides.</p>\n\n<p>This means that according to Judaism, one cannot just read the text of the Written Torah and fully understand what God wants from us. One needs to also consult the teachings of the Oral Torah. A classic example is the verse, \"and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall serve as a symbol between your eyes\". This verse cannot possibly be understood literally. According to the Oral Torah, it is referring to the practice of Tefillin. There are thousands of detailed rules regarding the preparation and use of Tefillin which are all detailed in the works of the Oral Torah. </p>\n\n<p>This is quite different than the idea of \"Biblical Inerrancy\" as understood by many Christian groups. Those groups believe that the Bible is to be understood literally at face value. this is completely foreign to Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>This is a matter of opinion, perhaps even amongst Rishonim.</p>\n<p>For example, there is Ralbag, who says about the number of stars and Avraham's vision at the brit bein habetarim</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יחוייב שיהיו אצל הנביא כל הדעות האמיתיות בענין סודות המציאות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2010/10/marc-b-shapiro-new-writings-from-r-kook.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Citing a post</a> by Dr. Marc Shapiro:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Ralbag, this is an example of a prophet receiving false information in accord with his mistaken conception. Since Abraham falsely believed that there are many stars, his prophecy contained this false conception, while in reality according to Ralbag there are actually a limited number of stars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As another example (from the same article), from Rav Kook, who refers to Rambam as a basis for the idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Kook explains that the Torah can describe events in a way not in accord with the astronomical or geological (i.e., historical) truth. This is done in order for the Torah to accomplish its goal, which is not focused on such matters but rather on ידיעת האלהות והמוסר וענפיהם בחיים ובפועל, בחיי הפרט, האומה והעולם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, based on the contemporary understanding of the world. The basis in Rambam is in factual errors in Yechezkel, so perhaps it would (according to Rambam) not extend to the Torah.</p>\n<p>Another example is (same post) \"[t]he fourteenth-century R. Eleazar Ashkenazi ben Nathan ha-Bavli\". When discussing the extremely long lifespans, he suggested</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>that the Torah recorded what the popular belief was, no matter how exaggerated, and Moses was not concerned about these sorts of things. In other words, just like today people say that the Torah is not interested in a scientific presentation of how the world was created, R. Eleazar’s position is that the Torah is not interested in a historically accurate presentation. In his mind, this has nothing to do with the Torah’s goals, and therefore there was no reason for the Torah not to present matters as they were believed at the time, even if these perceptions were inaccurate. The important thing, he says, is that the people would know that from the creation of the world until Israel stood at Sinai was close to three thousand years. This would help solidify belief in creation. The records of lifespans are just a means to illustrate this information.[18] He adds that when it came to events closer to Moses’ time, Moses was careful in preserving a more accurate accounting, while leaving the stories of the distant past cloaked in legend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For an example of a rishon propounding the idea that the Torah incorporates some necessary false beliefs, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caspi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Ibn Caspi</a>. So too Shadal. While I've written about it, so has Dr. Marc Shapiro. See this post on <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-writings-from-r-kook-and-assorted.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Seforim blog</a>. For instance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I must now deal with R. Joseph Ibn Caspi, who is often described as holding a view similar to what we have seen already, but more radical in that he saw it as a general principle of interpretation. I refer to the notion that the Torah incorporates all sorts of untruths because these were what people believed at the time. It is said that this is how Ibn Caspi understands the rabbinic phrase “The Torah speaks in the language of men.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would note that various Rishonim are not accepted in the current ultra-Orthodox world. There is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman\" rel=\"noreferrer\">no-true-Scotsman issue</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Person A: \"No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\"</p>\n<p>Person B: \"But my uncle Angus likes sugar with his porridge.\"</p>\n<p>Person A: \"Ah yes, but no <em>true</em> Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Various very religious and scholarly Jews held beliefs that nowadays are not standard frum theology, and the danger in rejecting them as non-Rishonim is that we first define who the Rishonim were based on theology and then assert we are following the Rishonim in matters of theology. (In similar manner, Abarbanel -- who rejected Ibn Caspi -- is himself considered 'not from our beis medrash' and  Yes, some contemporaries strongly criticized him for taking philosophical positions that they disagreed with, but so were others criticized who are certainly considered Rishonim (e.g. Ibn Ezra, Rambam).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inerrancy\" rel=\"nofollow\">The dictionary</a> defines <em>inerrancy</em> as \"freedom from error\", in which case, yes, the Torah has inerrancy.

The stage of <em>lashonos hatzemer</em>, as you said, is the stage before the spinning, and according to some <em>de'ot</em> you need <em>kavana</em> from that stage already</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Thank you to Leac and Menachem for their research and helpful answers. A few weeks ago, since asking my question, I just so happened to visit an Alpaca farm, where I came across a lady combing alpaca wool, so of course I asked her for information on wool terminology. I'm still no expert on wool making, but based on her answer I now think <em>lashonot hatzemer</em> refers to \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roving\" rel=\"nofollow\">rovings</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliver_%28textiles%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">slivers</a>\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/batting\" rel=\"nofollow\">battings</a>.\" </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'd always understood a \"tongue of wool\" to refer to the wool after it's been combed. Since the wool is long and narrow after it is combed, it is referred to as a tongue, which is also long and narrow. The wool is combed in order to clean it, and to prepare it for spinning into thread or yarn.</p>\n\n<p>I'd never actually seen what it actually looks like until I did some searching on the internet. Turns out there are tons of youtube videos showing how it's done. <a href=\"http://leighsfiberjournal.blogspot.com/2006/10/adventures-in-wool-combing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a blog post</a> where someone describes how they comb wool, with pictures.</p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.tallit-shop.com/tallit-tefillin-blog/tzitzit-2/tzitzit-buyers-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\">link provided in the question</a>, niputz is referred to as \"carding\". Carding is alternative method of preparing the wool for spinning. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e5uOX7Txqw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a youtube video</a> that demonstrates combing and compares it to carding.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer the first question (\"What exactly is <em>lashonot hatzemer</em>?\"). In order to spin wool into thread, the wool must be prepared. This is done by combing or carding, and the resulting wool is then ready to spin into thread. </p>\n\n<p>As for your second question (\"Where is it mentioned in halacha?\"), I'm assuming you mean besides the laws of making strings for tziztit, since that was mentioned in the link you provided. I'm not sure of any mention in halachic books, but the first mishna in the second chapter of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h42.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tractate Bava Metzia</a> mentions \"Leshonot shel Argaman\", tongues of purple wool.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Shalom Dovber Schneersohn zt\"l, the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe, defines it (in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15701&pgnum=14\">Kuntres Hatefillah ch. 5</a>) as the ability to empathize. A young boy or girl may be smart enough to understand something intellectually (such as that being poor is hard), but he or she is not capable of feeling it (say, for example, being able to identify with a poor person).</p>\n\n<p>Daas, as so defined, is critical to accepting one's responsibilities and privileges as a Jew.

Their union, which engenders children (in terms of the sefiros, these are the emotional attributes - chessed (\"kindness\"), gevurah (\"severity\"), and so forth), is daas, which is why the marital act is called \"daas\" in the Torah, as in Gen. 4:1. (R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi, in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/tanya/1/3.htm\">Tanya ch. 3</a>, points out that indeed without daas it is impossible to develop true love and fear of Hashem.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, a boy below 13 years old, and a girl below 12, lack mental daas - and therefore also its physical analogue, the ability to have children.

Also, Chazal believe Avraham to be the author of Psalm 89, so that may be why we put Tehillim first.]</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, we put the five megillos, but instead of ordering them chronologically by author, we order them (again, for convenience's sake,) chronologically by when during the year it is customary to read them publicly (starting with Passover): <strong>Shir Hashirim, Ruth, Eicha, Koheles, Esther.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we have the remaining books of Kesuvim, which we leave in the order that the gemara indicated: <strong>Daniel, Ezra/Nechemia, Divrei Hayamim.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Sources: Abarbanel's introduction to Yeshayahu and an essay on the order and authors of Kesuvim printed in the beginning of Mikraos Gedolos Orim Gedolim Tehillim vol. 1)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <em>Radak</em>'s introduction to <em>Yirm'ya</em> explains that the <em>g'mara</em> gives its reasons (the end of <em>M'lachim</em> is <em>churban</em> (destruction), so it matches <em>Yirm'ya</em>, and the end of <em>Y'chezkel</em> is <em>nechama</em> (consolation), so it matches <em>Y'sha'ya</em>, yielding the order <em>M'lachim</em>, <em>Yirm'ya</em>, <em>Y'chezkel</em>, <em>Y'sha'ya</em>), but the common order, <em>M'lachim</em>, <em>Y'sha'ya</em>, <em>Yirm'ya</em>, <em>Y'chezkel</em>, is chronological.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, if the term was \"toras chesed\", it would be \"TOras CHEsed\", as the accent in \"chesed\" is on the first syllable.\nThis rule is called \"nasog achor\".

I'm not interested in how these numbers are represented as holy numbers in Jewish texts, but rather thoughts, theories, or (ideally) knowledge on <em>why</em> people living thousands of years ago came to attach such significance to these two numbers.</p>\n\n<p>My presumption is that the number 7 has long been regarded as special by many cultures due to the fact that there are 7 heavenly bodies visible to the naked eye: the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. For instance, the names of the days of the week correspond to these seven heavenly bodies.</p>\n\n<p>But I am uncertain as to where or how or why the number 40 would have gained such significance.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>7 is the length of time for a natural cycle to transpire, often ending with holiness/sanctification of some sort (the pattern set by creation)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Seven days to the week (cycle of days) (and notably, seven times seven weeks from Passover to Shavuot, during which time the Jewish people transformed from a group of slaves into a nation at Mt.

The Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury.</p>\n\n<p>40 is the number of weeks of the average pregnancy, which likely adds to the meaning of 40 in Judaism as being a time of full gestation for a change to occur.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However,  I'm curious why you only ask about 7 and 40.  There are a few \"magical numbers\" in the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>1, (2?), 4, (5?), (6?), 7, 8, 10, 12, 40, and 70 all have significance.  One can speculate about why these numbers are chosen, but really they are just speculation.  The numbers with ? next to them are of limited significance, or are very significance in larger multiples (such as 600,000)</p>\n\n<p>The question then, is 10 a combination of 5 * 2? is 40 just 10 * 4? 70, 7*10 ?  Then, why multiplication? maybe 10 is 7 + 3, and 40 is 12 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 3? The speculation is truly endless.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  In response to Scott below, Numbers and their usage:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>God is declared 1 in the Shema, and is mentioned in the 10 commandments., Israel is also called an \"Am Achad\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Heaven and Earth are called to be witness.

These are described in terms of three intellectual and seven emotional attributes (and indeed, they are the spiritual sources of these thoughts and emotions as we experience them). The seven \"emotional\" <em>sefiros</em>, then, in their various combinations and permutations, make up the complete gamut of how we experience G-d's presence in our world (and also how we relate to each other).</p>\n\n<p>Further, these same sources describe four progressive spiritual \"worlds,\" in each of which G-dliness is more and more concealed; the last of these is our own world, where G-d's presence is barely recognizable - the universe appears to function on its own without a Creator at all, G-d forbid - and it takes considerable thought to see the truth behind the natural order. Each of these four \"worlds\" has its own version of the ten <em>sefiros</em>, again progressively coarsened until they assume the forms with which we're familiar.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, to echo <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7389/a-natural-explanation-for-the-significance-of-the-numbers-7-and-40/7393#7393\">Yaakov Ellis's point</a>, the underlying reason why 7 represents a natural cycle is because in terms of the <em>sefiros</em>, 7 is a complete group of them (the three \"intellectual\" attributes find their expression through them, just as in a human being, one's intellectual ideas have to be mediated to others through one's emotional qualities). So, for example, each day of the week reflects a different \"emotional\" mode in which we relate to G-d and He to us; similarly, each day of the mourning period is meant for a person to process their grief through the prism of that day's <em>sefirah</em> attribute; and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Forty is, again as Yaakov noted, a number representing complete transformation. This is arrived at by taking the total number of <em>sefiros</em> in all four stages of their spiritual evolution through the Four Worlds - in other words, the total number of (describable) ways in which we perceive G-dliness. (Here both the \"intellectual\" and the \"emotional\" <em>sefiros</em> come into play, because they are both co-equal parts of the human psyche and of its spiritual source/analogue.) Thus, for example, to receive the Divine Torah, Moses had to spend forty days transforming all of these forty aspects of himself and his relationship with G-d, literally becoming a new man in the process. So too, an impure person immerses in a pool of 40 <em>se'ah</em> of water (and the earth, during the Flood, had to undergo that number of days of cleansing with water), and comes out as a renewed being.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is an Eruv?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For the uninitiated, and for those who are unfamiliar with the advanced <em>halachic</em> concepts the knowledge of which is required in order to understand <em>hilchot Eiruvin</em> — how would you explain the purpose and function of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruv\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Eruv</em></a> without making it the seem like <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-march-23-2011/the-thin-jew-line\" rel=\"nofollow\">an easy way for Jews to get away with violating <em>halacha</em></a>?</p>\n\n<p>(\"Eruv\" in the context of this question is the <em>halachic</em> device whereby used to permit carrying outside on Shabbat in a place where it would have been forbidden to carry in the absence of the Eruv.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Another point is to note that an eruv only allows us to circumvent a rabbinical safeguard, not the original Torah law.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah prohibits carrying in a <em>reshus harabbim</em> (public domain); there are various criteria that define a place as such, but whatever it is, a <em>reshus harabbim</em> cannot be enclosed by an eruv.</p>\n\n<p>The rabbis later extended the prohibition to areas similar to a <em>reshus harabbim</em>, which they called <em>karmelis</em>. Most city streets, squares, etc., fall into this category.</p>\n\n<p>So just as (lehavdil) the same Congress that enacts, say, certain income-tax brackets also enacts various exceptions to them, and there is nothing wrong with structuring your business deals to take advantage of those exceptions - in much the same way, it is perfectly in order to use the rabbis' own device of an eruv in order to permit something that they themselves forbade.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I assume you are talking about the \"string\" that is commonly referred to as an eruv.  At the expense of over-simplifying:</p>\n\n<p>Generally, a reshus hayachid is an area which is mostly enclosed and contains no breaches.  A breach  is an opening larger than 10 cubits wide.  However, an opening that is more than 10 cubits is not considered a breach if it is formed as an entrance way- which includes 2 \"posts\" and a crossbar.</p>\n\n<p>The sages forbade carrying in an open area (breached),  even when not classified as the biblically restricted public domain, because of it's similarity to public domains (no walls).  An allowance was made for areas which indicated a similarity to a private domain through making it figuratively unbreached.  This is done through a series of entrance ways around the area using \"poles\" (lechi) and \"crossbars\".  Since there is no minimum thickness for these, a thin, but sturdy, wire is used.</p>\n\n<p>Unless the area is private property, a separate issue still exists.  The sages forbade carrying in an area with multiple families residences since it resembles a public domain even if there are walls (it is public).  An allowance was made where there was an indication that this domain is not public- called Eruv.  This is done by one head of a household acquiring bread (meal food) for everyone in the area.  Based on the idea that a person's home is where his food is, everyone now \"lives\" in a single residence where the bread is.  (Practically, this is done by the Rav, remains in the shul, and is done with matzos so they don't have to be replaced as bread stales quickly.)</p>\n\n<p>There are stricter and more lenient opinions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think the first step to counter that assumption would be to point out that it's <em>not</em> easy. Erecting it and maintaining it, along with the constant inspections that are necessary, are hard work. I can't claim to be an expert in advanced halacha by any means, but it seems a practical solution to a difficult problem raised by modernity.</p>\n\n\n",

I suspect that the Ashkenazic custom to recite the specific verses of תהילת ה (but not אברכה etc.) evolved out of a fusion of the Sefardic rite which followed this kabbalistic source, and the Ashkenazic rite which originally did not (as suggested <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2005/09/tehillas-hashem.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The rumours that these verses were connected to anti-Zionism seem unlikely to be historically accurate.</p>\n\n\n",

An early source for it is Midrash Hane'elam (a section of the Zohar), which <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38591&pgnum=88\" rel=\"nofollow\">states</a> that \"each of the forefathers knew Hashem through his own mirror [i.e., in a way that reflected his own personality]: ... Yitzchak knew Him on the level of gevurah, which is called \"the Fear of Yitzchak\" (Gen. 31:42), and always feared Him...\"</p>\n\n<p>There is also the idea that Eisav inherited Yitzchak's gevurah, but took it to an extreme, becoming not just stern but actually vicious. (By contrast, Yaakov also inherited it, but then went on to blend it with Avraham's chesed (\"kindness\"), yielding tif'eres (\"beauty\"), where chesed and gevurah are each utilized in their proper context.)</p>\n\n\n",

According to Nachmanides in Sha'ar HaGemul quoting Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer, She'ol is the lowest level of Hell, also known as Gehinom. He also has the best description of what it is and is cited by pretty much everyone else.  I wrote a paper about this for an English class in college - here's a rough translation of the section describing Gehinom (feel free to correct as necessary - I don't have the Sefer on hand):</p>\n\n<p>There are seven levels of Gehinom: Gehinom, Sha’arei Tzalmavet, Tit HaYavein, Bor Shachat, Avdon, and Sheol.  In each level of Gehinom there is a major sinner in Jewish History and ten nations: Avshalom (Absalom) in Gehinom, Doeg (Doeg) in Sha’arei Tzalmavet, Korach in Tit HaYavein, Achav (Ahab) in Bor Shachat, Micha (Micah) in Avdon, Elisha ben Avuya in Sheol.  In addition to Gehinom, there is a lesser known area below Gehinom called Arka where a small percentage of sinners go.  (Arka is similar to Hell in that sinners never leave.  However, it differs in that sinners burn eternally in a river of fire, rather than suffer different punishments for different sins.)</p>\n\n<p>From what I recall, it's very difficult to end up in Arka.  However, everyone - whether Jew or Gentile - goes through some level of Gehinom before going to Olam Habah.</p>\n\n<p>I know there is a section in Eruvin about it as well, but that discussion is about where the physical entrances to are (whether you can take that literally or not is a discussion for a different time).

(The bike is not considered part of the rider.)</li>\n<li>The bicycle may break, causing the rider to perhaps forget himself and fix it.</li>\n<li>Riding a bike is <em>uvdin d'chol</em> (weekday activity), and not appropriate on Shabbat.</li>\n<li>One might ride over soft soil, thereby transgressing the biblical prohibition against plowing. (Though the transgression in this case, I think would be Rabbinic.)</li>\n<li>A bicycle is <em>muktza</em>, as its primary use is for riding in public domains, which is generally <em>hotza'ah</em> (carrying), thus it is a <em>kli shem'lachto l'issur</em> (utensil that is designed primarily for a prohibited use).</li>\n<li>Even in a walled city, or one with an acceptable eruv, one may inadvertently ride outside of the eruv, or even outside of the <em>t'chum shabbat</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For one or more of these reasons, many contemporary poskim prohibit riding a bicycle on Shabbat, though there have been those that have permitted it. As Joshua Lee linked in the comments, see <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/Display.asp?PageIndex=48&ClipID=310\">here</a> for a short discussion.</p>\n\n<p>You implied in your question that perhaps riding a bike would be permitted with the understanding of the reason behind it being potentially prohibited, such as with the understanding that one may not ride over soft soil, or with the understanding that repairs may not be done. In general, the knowledge behind the reasoning of a rabbinic prohibition does not entitle one to transgress it. For example, the Sages felt it was necessary to forbid dancing on Shabbat, lest one come to bring musical accompaniment and further come to fix the instrument(s) if they break. This holds even if one understands that it is forbidden to fix instruments on Shabbat. We are still worried he may come to transgress a biblical prohibition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>As mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/6713/5\">my answer</a> to the question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/6711\">If no one else was available, could a mohel ride a bicycle on shabbos to perform a circumcision?</a>\":</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1401&st=&pgnum=56\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Ish Chai</a>, one can ride a bicycle on Shabbos inside an eiruv for leisure. Outside of an eruv, a mitzvah purpose might be needed, which includes attending shul to daven with a minyan, and certainly would include performing a bris.

Perhaps it has to do with the fear that you may come to fix it, but no actual <em>gezerah</em> was made forbidding it.

(Keritut 21b)</li>\n<li>If you own a bath house, you are not permitted to rent it out to a non-Jew who will run it on Shabbat, lest people (who did not know that you rented it out) think that you are performing prohibited actions on Shabbat</li>\n<li>A Jew who is a resident of Israel, who is traveling outside of Israel for one of the festivals should not perform prohibited actions on the second day of the festival (which is only for those who are not residents of Israel) because someone may see this being done and, not knowing that this person is a resident of Israel, would assume that either a prohibited action is being performed or that the prohibited action is permitted. (There are other reasons as well - this halacha is a point of contention among modern <em>poskim</em> - if it applies to you, please make your own inquiries and do not rely on this site)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It has many applications across halacha, including the laws of Shabbat, Avodah Zarah and Kashrut.</p>\n\n<p>An important additional principle is that כל מקום שאסרו חכמים מפני מראית העין - אפילו בחדרי חדרים אסור - Anything that the sages prohibited because of <em>maris ayin</em> is forbidden, even when it is performed in a private room (Beizah 9a). In other words, once something is prohibited by chazal for this reason, one is not allowed to rationalize that one can perform the action in private because no one will see it. (This principle is also the subject of much debate among halachic authorities).</p>\n\n\n",

There is a dispute among Rishonim as to what exactly תחית המתים (Resurrection of the dead) means (Rambam and Ramban have different understandings), and what it will mean for those who are living at the time. So then maybe read it as \"if we die before the Resurrection, then out souls will be returned to us when the Resurrection arrives).

The Gemara says the distance is from meal to meal.  Some interpret this as needing to bentch on your meat and start your milk at a different meal- the upshot being to distinguish it through separate meals.</p>\n\n<p>Others interpret the gemara as waiting the amount of time sages would wait for their meal (seudas talmidei chachamim).  This is six hours.  While no reason is given in the gemara, rishonim posit reasons.  One reasoning is that that is the time it takes for the meat particles to break down in the mouth enough to be considered unmeaty for halachic standards.  After that, we negate the particles.  </p>\n\n<p>So, if your custom is to wait less than six hours, you must clean your teeth of any meat through kinuach v'hadacha (liquid and food rinsing) (Rema YD 89:1).

You can eat immediately after rinsing (Shach there); I'm not sure how long you must wait to avoid needing to rinse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong>  Definite particles must be removed after 6 hours (plus a mouth rinse).

Can anyone provide a source?  (The sauce would be a light Alfredo; the source would be somewhere in <em>Yoreh Deah</em> I expect...)</p>\n\n<p>Following on from that, and hopefully to be found in the same source, is my more practical question: can you kasher a pot from meaty to pareve, so that you could cook pasta to be eaten with that yummy Alfredo sauce?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The Sefer הכשרות by רב יצחק יעקב פוקס explains as follows (chapter 3:5)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For Sefardim, as long as the item is not <em>ben yomo</em> (has not been used for cooking with dairy/meat) in the last day, it is permissible to change from Dairy to Meat, even <em>lechatchila</em>. Sources: Pri Chadash YD 97:1, Chidah - Machzik Beracha 509:2, Aruch haShulchan YD end of siman 89 and 181:11, Yabia Omer YD 3:4.</li>\n<li>For Ashkenazim the minhag is not to change from one type to the next (Magen Avraham OC 509:11 - since if you get used to changing over, you might make a mistake and kasher a <em>ben yomo</em> pot by mistake) unless it is one of the following circumstances:\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sha'at haDechak</em> - Pressing Need/No other choice (i.e.: you need to use the pot for something pressing) (Prim Megadim Eishel Avraham OC 152:13)</li>\n<li>Kashering pre-Pesach to get rid of chametz, can switch over from Meat/Dairy (Mishnah Berurah 451:19)</li>\n<li>If you will use it for some period of time as a <em>pareve</em> pot before going to the other type (Shu\"t Maharsham 2:241, Tzitz Eliezer 9:38)</li>\n<li>If it had become <em>treif</em> anyway (ex: it was a milk pot that was accidentally used for meat, when you kasher it you can change it to meat) (Mishnah Berurah 509:25, Shu\"t Be'er Moshe 3:105, Maharsham from above)</li>\n<li>It hasn't been used for a year+ with its current milk/meat type (Shu\"t Maharsham from above)</li>\n<li>Received it as a gift and want to change it</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If you want to kasher using <em>libun</em> you can do so at any time, even for Ashkenazim (Sha'ar haMelech, Hil. Yom Tov, 4:8)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Following from all of that, it seems that if you are Sefardi then as long as the pot is not <em>ben yomo</em> you can kasher to the other type. If you are Ashkenazi then you cant do it unless one of the conditions from above apply (I don't know if wanting yummy alfredo sauce would be considered a pressing need).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>See the Aruch HaShulchan YD 89:17 where he writes:</p>\n\n<p>יש מי שרוצה לומר שאין להגעיל כלי של בשר לשל חלב או להיפך, מטעם שמא לא יהיה לו רק כלי אחת ויגעילה מבשר לחלב ומחלב לבשר ואתי למיטעי, וחומרא יתירה היא, ואין לנו לגזור גזירות מדעתינו. (ועי' מג\"א סימן תק\"ט סקי\"א שכתב גם בשם הגאון מפוזנא להתיר):</p>\n\n<p>from which we see that there is no prohibition to kasher the milk pot to meat or vice versa according to him. That was a superfluous stringency held by some. According to the Aruch HaShulchan, you can kasher the vessels all you want without any \"conditions\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not sure you'll find a clear source, since one may Kasher from meat to/from dairy all year round. (Yoreh Deah 93)</p>\n\n<p>(In some religious neighborhoods in Israel they provide Kashering facilities (a huge boiling pot of water) every few weeks; usually on Erev Shabbat Mevorchim.)</p>\n\n<p>There are opinions (as I was told by an learned Rabbi) that one should not Kasher \"back and forth\" so as not to get confused. For this reason he suggested we get 2 ovens.</p>\n\n<p>So if you want a \"one off\" Kashering to make a pot permanently Pareve you probably will not find anybody who will prohibit it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Etymology of the surname \"Katz\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there sources for the etymology of the surname Katz being an acronym for Kohen Tzedek?</p>\n\n<p>Is that simply a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym\" rel=\"nofollow\">backronym</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are many manuscripts and early printed seforim in which this name appears and there is a \" in between the kof and tzadi. This clearly indicates that it is an acronym. One source is the seforim of the Shach, in which, although he is commonly (currently) known by the last name Katz, he is called <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45712&pgnum=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Kohein Tzedek.</a> Then look <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41340&pgnum=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Notice that only 9 years later Kohein Tzedek has become Katz. The Salonika print is in Tav Kuf Samech Alef (5561 or 1801) and the Lvov print is in Tav Kuf Ayin (5570 or 1810.)</p>\n\n<p>[This answer is adapted from my comments on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4873/what-are-some-examples-of-jewish-names/4880#4880\">this answer</a> to another question. Thank you Ariel for the easy link!]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While Katz is likely an acronym for Kohen Tzedek, there is something else to keep in mind.  Many names - especially those of immigrants - changed.  This is especially true with immigrants to the US.  This means that the name Katz could reasonably be a shortened version of something considerably longer, such as Katzenellenbogen, which is a place name (somewhere in Southern Germany near the Italian border).  In that case, it has nothing to do with being a Kohen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It would most likely be a backronym if all the Katz families were related. In fact there appear to be many distinct Katz families, and many (although not all) are cohanim, which implies that the name arose either independently or imitatively, perhaps at a time when Jews were obliged to take surnames by the secular authorities. </p>\n\n<p>One interesting thing to note is that I have seen some records transcribe the letters כ\"צ on a tombstone as if it were the name \"Katz\" - e.g., גרשן בן משה כ\"צ becomes \"Gershon ben Moshe Katz\". If this occurred in secular records it would imply that some families may have adopted the surname Katz without really meaning to!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are women unclean longer after giving birth to a girl?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read that women are unclean for two weeks after giving birth to a girl and seven days after giving birth to a boy. What does it tell us?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 24)\n\n<p>I recommend that you take a look at the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0910818126\">commentary</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading_cdo/aid/15577\">Leviticus 12</a>, and in particular 12:5. I'll try to summarize the pertinent points here, but I won't do his beautiful thoughts and words justice.</p>\n\n<p>The \"uncleanliess\" you're referring to is \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumah_and_taharah\">tum-a</a>.\" According to R' Hirsch, tum-a is a mental condition that would prevent a person from participating in holy practices with the correct mindset. In particular, many types of tum-a cause this problem by afflicting a person with the illusion that people are trapped by the physical world and have no genuine free will. One can't participate in the holy service, in which one dedicates some aspect of oneself to God, without a complete sense that one is approaching God out of free choice. The paradigm of this type of tum-a is contact with a human corpse, which can give a person the depressing impression that people have no more value than this inanimate body.</p>\n\n<p>In the process of giving birth, a woman necessarily surrenders to the overwhelming physical process and thus is intimately subject to the illusion that she is an unfree object of natural forces rather than the holy, volitional being that she is. Until enough time has passed for the depressing effects of this spiritual trauma to ebb, she needs to take a break from holy offerings that require a whole spirit. That's the tum-a that she experiences. The first stage of such recovery takes seven days.</p>\n\n<p>That's for the mother. Of course, the child who's born also goes through a traumatic physical process and what's more, needs to be inducted for the first time into the world of free-willed submission to God. For this purpose, we have different processes for a son and for a daughter. For a son, we do circumcision (12:3), which R' Hirsch says represents \"the free willed moral subordination of our physical bodily sensuality under the laws of God\" (see his commentary on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=9169&p=7\">Genesis 17</a> for more).</p>\n\n<p>For a daughter, the mother goes through the tum-a recovery period for a second time. It will be the mother's job, in addition to serving as a free-willed moral Jewish Woman in her own right, to also serve as a model of that role for her new daughter. \"... and at the birth of each fresh daughter has doubly to arm herself, for the child and for herself, to tread the lofty path of purity and morality up to the heights preached by the Sanctuary of God.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>One way to look at Tuma is that it is a lack of holiness. When a women gives birth she has less life inside her, and thus less holiness.</p>\n\n<p>When she gives birth to a girl she lost more holiness than with a boy because the girl inside her also has the capacity to grow life.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.613design.com/tti/articles/tahara-tuma.pdf\">http://www.613design.com/tti/articles/tahara-tuma.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The gemoro niddah 31b asks this question. The gemoro answers that tuma  is dependant on when she will accept her husband back again. Rather a new notion for it. That the idea of tuma is to stop her being available for her husband so that he should not be able to 'force' or 'pressurise'  her into it.\n And for a boy where everyone is pleased it is after seven days and for a girl fourteen.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How should the words \"all\" and \"every\" be interpreted in the Scriptures?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the correct way of interpreting and understanding the words <em>all</em> and <em>every</em> in the Bible? My problem is that I learned maths for years and sometimes it makes it very hard for me to understand things. Mathematically <em>every</em> means that there is no exception. But what does this word mean in the Bible?</p>\n\n<h3>Exampe 1</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And of every living thing of all\n  flesh, two of every sort shalt thou\n  bring into the ark, to keep them alive\n  with thee; they shall be male and\n  female.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>vs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of every clean beast thou shalt take\n  to thee seven and seven, the male and\n  his female; and of the beasts that are\n  not clean two, the male and his\n  female.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taking the first citation literally means that two were taken into the ark from even the clean beasts. But the second says later that there were seven from them. In this case however the two sentences are relatively close, so they’re straightforward for everyone (except me with my overly mathematical mind).</p>\n\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n\n<p>What about fish? They are living flesh, I think, so Noah should have taken fish into the ark too. But I don’t think fish were killed by the cataclysm. Or were they?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And every living thing was destroyed\n  that was upon the face of the ground,\n  both man, and cattle, and creeping\n  things, and birds of the heavens; and\n  they were destroyed from the earth:\n  and Noah only was left, and they that\n  were with him in the ark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fish are not “upon the face of the ground” so they might survive, however if only those who were in the ark were saved, then fish should have been destroyed.</p>\n\n<h3>Coda</h3>\n\n<p>To be clear: this question is not about the fish and Noah’s ark (those are merely examples), but about understanding the words <em>every</em> and <em>each</em> in the Bible.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Among the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\">13 principles of Torah interpretation</a> are that sometimes the Torah may express itself using \"a general statement followed by a specific one,\" or vice versa, or \"a general statement, a specific one, and then another general one.\" In each of these cases, the general statement is meant to be limited in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Your first example, about the number of animals taken into the ark, is a case of \"a general statement followed by a specific one.\" The general rule is that two of each animal were to be taken; then this is modified by adding an extra detail - that this is the minimum, but that there are some species where it should be more.</p>\n\n<p>Your second example is somewhat similar as well. First G-d tells Noah to take \"all living things, all flesh\" into the ark (Gen. 6:19), but then He immediately qualifies (in the next verse) that this includes only \"the birds... the animals... the creeping creatures on the ground\" - thus excluding fish. (Two verses earlier, too, G-d specifies that the Flood will destroy \"all that is on the land,\" so this also makes it clear that fish and other aquatic creatures are excluded.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The language of mathemeticians and logicians is very specialized, and, to do their job adequately, they usually have to be careful (and perhaps pedantic) about the precision and accuracy with every aspect of the language that they use. Imputing mathematical denotations of language to literature that clearly does not share the same standards of precision and detail is not appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose, for example, somebody were to tell you, <em>I itch like crazy because there were a billion mosquitoes chewing me up yesterday</em>. There are several problems with this sentence when you view it with undue precision: mosquitoes don't chew people up, <em>per se</em>, the number of mosquitoes was likely rather smaller than one billion (regardless of whether you use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales\" rel=\"nofollow\">short or long scale</a>) and it is not really characteristic of crazy people to itch. Despite these apparent shortcomings to the pedant who supposes that language ought to be perfectly precise, literal and unambiguous, I would guess that you easily understand what was meant.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true when considering whether or not the fish were destroyed. Unless the fish were with Noah on the ark (in which case there would be no issue), I think it is fairly well understood to the reader what was meant: that everything that lived on the face of the ground and in the air was destroyed, but not fish. (Of course, in some minds, it still leaves the question about creatures like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl\" rel=\"nofollow\">axolotls</a> that live in water but are capable of walking on land.) However, even with a more precise point of view I could argue that in context, <em>only Noah was left</em> among the the group of <em>every living thing that was on the face of the ground</em>, and not the larger group of <em>every living thing</em>. Similarly, I could argue that there were in fact two pairs of each clean animal on the ark, but there is no contradiction because there were also three pairs of each clean animal, as well as four, and five, all the way up to seven.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Avraham Ben Harambam writes in Hamaspik L'ovdey Hashem (shaar habitachhon) that the word כל is used to mean \"most\" throughout scripture. (He writes this regarding the verse in Psalms 145:16 \"satisfy the desire of <em>every</em> living thing).</p>\n\n<p>R. Saadya Gaon writes this too in his commentary to the Torah (I will try to find it).</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps as tactful as you can get is to do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apologize and explain: \"I'm sorry, but religiously, I try to avoid unnecessary contact with women (other than my wife).\" No need to go further than that. It may help the awkwardness to acknowledge the fact that the situation is indeed awkward. Perhaps say, \"I apologize for the awkwardness, but...\"</li>\n<li>Be respectful. This shows that the handshake refusal has nothing to do with lack of respect for women. A smile and lots of eye contact help in this regard.</li>\n<li>Keep your right hand busy with something. Even with your explanation, it is awkward to have her arm outstretched with your hand <em>right there</em> not doing anything. Be holding a briefcase or other item, or be holding onto a door handle, or at least have your hand in your pocket.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is important not to be embarrassed by the situation; a certain amount of confidence is necessary.

Whatever the meanings, what exactly is he saying? The two possibilities I have in mind are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that there are four homophonous and homonymous words, written \"כי\" or</li>\n<li>that there is some concept or meaning that is approximated in translation by the range of these other four, and therefore can express any one of them in different contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is underlying Resh Lakish's words?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>No source that I know of, but I'd venture that something closer to your second possibility is correct: there is one word כי in Hebrew, but it has a lot of nuances.</p>\n\n<p>Consider how, in English, the word \"then\" has several different meanings: temporal comparative (\"first A happened, then B\"), temporal noncomparative (\"things were good then\"), nontemporal comparative (\"he says A, but then I disagree\"), and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>In somewhat the same way, then, it may be that the underlying meaning of כי is \"a conjunction of some kind,\" tying two clauses together; the exact type of tie (whether one is a dependent clause of the other, or they're independent, etc.) depends on context, and can be translated using various Aramaic (or English) conjunctions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think the correct answer to \"what exactly is [Resh Lakish] saying\" is simply that the word \"ki\" may mean different things in different contexts.</p>\n\n<p>It's definitely only one word in Hebrew, and IMHO there's no single underlying concept or meaning uniting all the terms.  </p>\n\n<p>Rather, if you're an Aramaic speaker, and you want to translate/explicate/darshen a pasuk, you will find yourself reaching for different terms for the same word.</p>\n\n<p>To give an example from English, I think this is similar to trying to translate the word \"with.\"  (Davar b'shem omro, I learned this from <a href=\"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russell and Norvig</a>.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I ate spaghetti with a fork.</li>\n<li>I ate spaghetti with dinner.</li>\n<li>I ate spaghetti with friends.</li>\n<li>I ate spaghetti with meatballs.</li>\n<li>I ate spaghetti with abandon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every English speaker knows that there's only one word \"with.\"  But if you translate those sentences into other languages, you may find that correct idiomatic language use compels you to use different words for different situations.  </p>\n\n<p>I think that there is no single concept or meaning here, because the only possibility for that concept would be \"togetherness\" or perhaps \"unity,\" but squashing all the above meanings into the concept would (a) unite too many disparate things, and (b) not explain when to use \"with\" and when to use a different word.  I expect some people to disagree with me, but not if they fluently speak languages other than English.</p>\n\n<p>I'd also like to give an example of what Resh Lakish is <em>not</em> saying.  In Hebrew, the word \"`etz\" can be translated into Aramaic as either \"a`a\" (that's אעא) or \"ilana.\"  In English, these would be rendered \"wood\" and \"tree,\" but note that in English you might also need to use \"lumber.\"  In this case, it's still a single word in Hebrew, but there is a concrete understanding that it encompasses trees and things made out of what used to be trees.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi explains (at great length, with many examples) that the word כי is used in place of these four different words/concepts.

He can only be shaliach tzibbur if the minyan agrees to let him daven in Nusach Edot HaMizrach, and if not he should refuse the honor.</p>\n\n<p>Among the reasons for this is a very strong preference (for kabbalistic reasons) that Sepharadim should daven in their own nusach, and this overrides being the shaliach tzibbur. But aside from that it would seem that the shaliach tzibbur in any minyan should be proficient in the nusach of that minyan, and therefore \"cross-davening\" should be problematic even between Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sephard.</p>\n\n<p>Why are Ashkenazim meikil to allow the someone who usually davens Nusach Ashkenaz to be shaliach tzibbur in a Nusach Sephard congregation and vice-versa?

When I hold a Friday Night Minyan during the winter months at my home for the neighborhood, I have specifically noted in my bulletin the rules. And the rules are that like at the Kotel, the shliach tzibur davens his nusach. Now that may make some people a little uncomfortable who want it their way, I have clearly laid the guidelines out. So if you do not like it as a member of the minyan you are free not to daven at my home.  Now most shuls set their minhagim, and guests should follow the minhag hamakom. I think that is fairly clear in our tradition.  I have never heard that sephardi can just do whatever they like.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the Yalkut Yosef consists of Rav Ovadia Yosef's rulings, which by definition mean they will always prefer Sephardic Minhagim over anything Ashkenazi.

My father (may he live and be well to 120) davens Nusach Sefard and anytime he has Yahrzeit or is asked to be the Sha\"tz, he davens Ashkenaz because that's what his shul uses.  </p>\n\n<p>This is a major problem in Israel, especially where the established custom is to follow the Nusach of the Sha\"tz.

    "content": "# Heter, esp. from R' Moshe, for shaving with a machine?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have asked this question to many people without every getting an answer. Perhaps someone on this forum has some information. </p>\n\n<p>All of the achronim that I have found, who address the issue in writing, write that shaving with a machine is prohibited. (See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21303\">Sefer Hadrat Panim Zakan</a> for a compilation of many of them.) Nevertheless it is extremely common amongst Orthodox Jews to shave with an electric razor. When I have asked people what the heter is, they almost universally quote a Heter of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. I have challenged dozens of people over the years to produce this heter for me. Nobody has. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there any written heter from Reb Moshe, and if there isn't how do so many Orthodox Jews justify going against the written psak of dozens of Achronim based solely on a \"shmuah\" that Reb Moshe gave a heter?

According to this approach, when the Gemara rules that an item which both destroys and shaves is prohibited, and defined this item as being a razor, it did not merely mention a razor as an example of an item that achieves both of these requirements, but mentioned it in order to define which instrument is forbidden by the Torah to use. The Gemara explains that when the Torah forbade destroying and shaving one's beard, the Torah was referring to a razor which achieves both of these functions, and not to other instruments which are categorically permissible. It follows that even if one manipulates scissors to enable it to achieve השחתה, it is still permitted, since the Torah did not forbid the end result, but forbade the use of a specific instrument to achieve this result. What categorizes an item as scissors, which is permitted, or as a razor, which is forbidden, is the fact that a razor cuts using one blade, whereas scissors use two blades to cut.</p>\n<p>Based on this thesis, Rav Moshe permitted the use of shavers since they function as scissors, utilizing two blades to cut. The inner blade does not cut by itself, and must be assisted by the outer screen of the shaver. The screen traps a hair within it, and as the inner blade approaches it, the hair rubs along the side of the screen and they both cut the hair simultaneously.<sup>28</sup></p>\n<p>Although this was Rav Moshe’s primary heter to permit the use of shavers, he had an additional approach that followed a similar line of reasoning. He maintained that the only type of instrument that is prohibited, is one that most people use when they wish to achieve a close shave; all other instruments are permitted. Since most non-Jews use razors when they desire a close shave, all other instruments are therefore permitted. However, if for arguments sake, the general custom would change and people would only use shavers even if they desired a very close cut, razors would be permitted and shavers would be forbidden.<sup>29</sup></p>\n<p>Footnote 28: Thus I heard in the form of \"reliable testimony\" (עדות נאמנה) from Rav Belsky, Rav Dovid Feinstein and Rav Reuven Feinstein</p>\n<p>Footnote 29: Thus I head from Rav Reuven Feinstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, with regard to lift-and-cut:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is important to mention that Rav Moshe Feinstein was very skeptical about permitting the use of a lift and cut shaver when it was first shown to him in his later years. One should bear in mind that the widespread heter to use electric shavers is primarily because Rav Moshe, being the posek hador of the past generation, permitted their use. Most poskim in Eretz Yisroel on the other hand, forbade their use. Consequently, it is questionable how a person who relies on Rav Moshe’s shitah with regard to shaving, can go ahead and use a lift and cut shaver which Rav Moshe himself was skeptical about.<sup>31</sup></p>\n<p>Footnote 31: This is what I heard from Rav Belsky, Rav Dovid Feinstein and Rav Reuven Feinstein. See Halichot Shelomo page 11 who gives another rationale to permit shaving...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The site says that it is put out by <em>Halacha Berurah</em> and lists authors at the top of the page.</p>\n<p>It would seem that there is no written <em>heter</em> in Igrot Moshe for shaving. However, despite this, Rav Moshe's (and Rav Heinkin's) position on this seems to be pretty well known (the author quotes two of his sons directly).</p>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"http://www.koshershaver.org/faqs.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page</a> under the heading <strong>UPDATE: FEBRUARY 2011 / ADAR I 5771</strong> where the author provides what he claims to be up to date psakim by Rav Dovid Feinstein, Rav Belski and Rav Heineman.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Going back to the KosherShavers page, footnote 23 ( <a href=\"http://www.koshershaver.org/why.htm#_ftn23\">http://www.koshershaver.org/why.htm#_ftn23</a>) makes it clear that R. Henkin has a written tshuva on the matter: כתבי הגר\"י הענקין ח\"ב דף רמ\"ד בענין גדילת הזקן</p>\n\n<p>(And R.

However, a distinction must be made in terminology between \"being gay\" (which for the purposes here we could define as being sexually attracted to members of one's own gender) and engaging in homosexual acts (where Male-Male intercourse is an unambiguous violation of a Torah-level prohibition and Female-Female may be a rabbinic prohibition).</p>\n\n<p>So with those definitions, being gay would not be a sin from a Judaism perspective. Engaging in homosexual acts is a sin. One can definitely be a Jew and be Gay at the same time, and one can be Jewish and engage in homosexual acts at the same time, just as one can be Jewish and violate the Sabbath or eat non-Kosher food at the same time - a Jew who sins is still a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding how the Jewish community thinks about gays - it depends on the community. This can range from being very respectful and welcoming (and for some of the most liberal non-Orthodox denominations, allowing and sanctioning such unions) to don't-ask-don't-tell to downright hostility. It just depends on the community (though the topic is definitely more polarizing than \"how does Judaism think about Sabbath violators\", or almost any other topic). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>@Yaakov Ellis gave an excellent answer, but I would add just a single thought to explain to don't-ask-don't-tell attitude of many communities.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, Judaism sees homosexual acts as a sin.  (Perhaps different levels of prohibition depending on the gender.)  However, Judaism does not generally consider predilection to a sin to be a sin itself.  It may a difficult test, to be sure, but Judaism expects people (of all backgrounds) to overcome their temptations (whatever they may be).</p>\n\n<p>Judaism does not generally approve of broadcasting one's personal tests and shortcomings.  (Note that one is not allowed to speak לשון הרע (negative speech) about oneself.)  Since Judaism classifies homosexual acts as a sin, one would expect an observant Jews to not broadcast or classify themselves based on their temptation to sin.  I think this is the general basis for the don't-ask-don't-tell attitude of many communities.  They might be welcoming of gay individuals, but at the same time not be supportive of Gay Pride movements.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Torah contains prohibitions against many activities that Hashem assures us are spiritually harmful to us. These are mainly activities that we might otherwise want to do. </p>\n\n<p>On one hand, practicing homosexuality is one of these proscribed activities, on the other hand, Jews who are homosexual will find this prohibition far harder than any other.</p>\n\n<p>Certain less tolerant communities will reject a practicing homosexual, as they would reject any Jew who didn't keep Shabbat or kashrut.

If God \"relinquished\" His will for it to exist, it would then cease to exist. [This is very different, however, from the idea that God continuously creates everything <em>ex nihilo</em>.] There he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולם שלזה גם כן כוונו הקדושים בתקונם בתפלת יוצר ובטובו מחדש בכל יום תמיד מעשה בראשית כי הוא יתברך ברצונו נותן אליו תמיד המציאות והקיום ובזה הוא מחדשו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, he seems to be translating \"מחדש\" non-literally to mean \"supports the existence of\" instead of \"renews\" or \"recreates\". But we do get to translate \"תמיד\" here as \"continuous\".</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I prefer the former interpretation, but both answer the question originally asked. The assumptions stated in the question hold true. The universe functions with a natural order since its creation, and our statement every morning in the <em>b'rachos</em> of <em>k'rias shema</em> does not contradict that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7988/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shaar Hayichud Veha'emunah, ch. 2</a>) that all of creation itself is \"anti-natural,\" in that everything that exists was created <em>ex nihilo</em> (יש מאין), and so it would naturally tend to revert to nothingness. Hashem has to keep on re-creating it constantly in order for this not to happen.</p>\n\n<p>(He draws an analogy with the splitting of the Red Sea, where \"a strong east wind\" had to keep blowing all night (Ex. 14:21), since otherwise the water would keep on flowing rather than standing as a solid wall.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps think of the existence of the Creator as the prime existence upon which all of creation depends.

In this way, one can realize that at any moment that HaShem would not re-create the creation, all would die and not exist.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the phrase goes \"...מחדש בכל יום <strong>תמיד</strong>\".

Men are obligated to be involved in both, whereas women are only obligated in the former.</p>\n\n<p>Hence: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>mature female = 10 [= completion] x (3 [=family]) = 30 shekels</li>\n<li><p>mature male = 10 [= completion] x ( 3 [=family] + 2 [=community]) = 50 shekels</p></li>\n<li><p>toddler girl, proportional fraction of adult duties = 3 shekels</p></li>\n<li><p>toddler boy, proportional fraction of adult duties = 3 + 2 = 5 shekels</p></li>\n<li><p>young female, working towards completion (10) in the family realm = 10 shekels</p></li>\n<li>young male, working towards completion (10) in both family and public realms (x2) = 20 shekels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Note that the Torah's stage of \"working towards completion\" is ages 5 to 20, or 15 years. If we split that in half, we get two stages: 5--12.5, and 12.5--20. That fits well with the concept of bar/bat mitzvah -- half that time is maturing <em>without</em> the technical obligation, and half the time with.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>retired female, back to her prior state of responsibilities = 10 shekels</li>\n<li>retired male, given a reduced role of communal responsibilities = 10 (family) + 1/2 * 10 (community) = 15 shekels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Gemara does observe that retirement age proportionately devaluates a man more than a woman, hence the Talmudic saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An older lady in the house is a treasure; an older man in the house is a waste of space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which sounds similar to the way one lady described having her retired husband home (I believe this is attributed to the Cosby show):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's like having a grand piano sitting in your kitchen.

He had more working potential.</p>\n\n\n",

To answer your questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>R' Gamliel, as quoted by the gemara there, said \"כלום יש אדם שיודע לתקן ברכת הצדוקים\", implying that the purpose of the b'racha was against the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sadducees</a>. However, the text of the gemara is quoted differently by different sources. Rambam (Tefilla, 2:1) writes the reason for this b'racha as \"בימי ר\"ג רבו האפיקורוסין בישראל והיו מצירים לישראל ומסיתין אותן לשוב מאחרי השם\", and Kesef Mishna there quotes the above gemara with \"האפיקורוסין\" instead of \"הצדוקים\". Others, when referring to the gemara, used the term \"מינים\". These terms are more general for those with heretical beliefs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=J_tgjNSZ5lwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=world%20of%20prayer&hl=en&ei=AazWTZOvE4G4sAOGpIyxBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDMQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Elie Munk</a>, citing Halachos Gedolos, Machzor Vitry, and Rashi's uncensored commentary on the gemara, writes that Christianity was clearly the purpose of this b'racha, as is also indicated by the time period in which it was written.</p>\n\n<p>However, זדים were also included in the b'racha to pray for their demise. They are the blatant evildoers (פושעים) within the Jews. (See Megilla 17b)</p></li>\n<li><p>According to the gemara (Berachos 29a), the reason we \"eject\" the sh'liach tzibbur if he skips (or perhaps even hesitates at) this b'racha is because we suspect he is a מין himself.</p>\n\n<p>Some may be offended by this b'racha because it is a prayer for the demise of other human beings. However, the Gra's nusach is to say \"וכל הרשעה כרגע תאבד\" instead of \"וכל עושי רשעה\", to pray for the destruction of the evil instead of the evildoer.</p></li>\n<li><p>This b'racha is generally called ברכת המינים, or ברכת האפיקורסים, or ברכת הצדוקים, depending on your version of the gemara in b'rachos. Some call it ברכת המשומדים, though, as many texts have the b'racha beginning with \"ולמשומדים אל תהי תקוה\". The Tur (OC 118) calls this b'racha קללת המינים.</p></li>\n<li><p>The gemara above, in its discussion of whether we suspect people of heretical beliefs, brings the case of R' Yochanan Kohen Gadol, who after many years of faithful service, became a צדוקי.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rashi (Megillah 17b, ד\"ה כלו הפושעים) identifies them as people שאינם מאמינין בדת משה שהיתה מן השמים - who deny the Divine origin of the Torah. By comparison, in a different context, Rambam (Hil. Teshuvah 3:7) defines \"minim\" as people who deny some aspect of Hashem's divinity - His existence, individuality, noncorporeality or infinite existence, or who worship intermediaries between themselves and Him.</p>\n<p>According to Rashi, then, I'm not sure what identifiable historical movement would be the target of this berachah - the earliest author I know of who questions this principle was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiwi_al-Balkhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chivi Habalchi</a>, in the era of the Geonim. According to Rambam, on the other hand, the early Christians might well be described as minim, on the grounds of the fifth item in his list.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This berachah, for obvious reasons, has indeed suffered heavily from censorship over time. Still, though, we do see that it asks for the punishment and defeat of the minim (it is in fact the only berachah in Shemoneh Esrei where we ask for something negative like that). Even a min does believe in Hashem (at least in some distorted version), so he might indeed balk at reciting such a blessing and thereby cursing himself - and we'd eject him for precisely that reason: we don't want anything to do with such a person (the halachah about minim, after all, is that מורידין ואין מעלין).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The standard edition of the Gemara (Berachos 28b-29a) calls it ברכת הצדוקים, and Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 126:1) calls it ברכת המלשינים. And Rambam's version (at the end of Sefer Ahavah, in Yemenite manuscripts) begins ולמשומדים. So it's hard to tell what's the original name.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Don't know how famous they are, but the Gemara mentions a couple of people named Yaakov who are identified as minim: \"Yaakov of Kfar Sechanyah\" (Avodah Zarah 17a and 27b), a contemporary of R' Eliezer and R' Yishmael (early 2nd century); and another one (ibid. 27b) who was a contemporary of R' Abahu (late 3rd century).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.bc.edu/dam/files/research_sites/cjl/sites/partners/csg/archives/langer_spring07.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> University based research paper regarding versions the bracha.  The paper should be intellectually divided between facts (e.g. artifacts found in places like the Cairo geniza) and hypotheses which are good guesses, but should be taken as such.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Notzrim are mentioned in most versions, and so are minim, implying that they are different.  So perhaps the minim are tzedukim.  It's not clear what the original version was (the paper suggests it was the 6th skeletal version), but it may be a catch all bracha that changed over time according to the circumstances.  (It's not clear from the Gemara what Shmuel hakatan did, but it sounds like the idea of the bracha existed previously and Raban Gamliel was looking for a mesorah for the nusach.)</p>\n\n\n",

Etymologically, the earliest instances of the the name \"Feibush\" are written as \"Vivs\"  (Vivus) which is the Latin equivalent of \"[C]Haim\", \"life\", a name which was given to sick children (and adults) to \"confuse the Angel of Death\" (who could then no longer find the person named on his \"list\" who he had to kill).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stated a bit differently <a href=\"http://jewishwebindex.com/Names.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (scroll about halfway down):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Uri, Shraga and Phoebus (of which Feivish and Feivel are yiddishized corruptions) all mean basically 'bright', 'shining', 'light'.</p>\n<p>\"Fayvush or Faivel are the kinnuim of Shraga.  Fayvush is an ancient Jewish name whose origin was the Latin vivus (living, alive), a loan translation (calque) from Hebrew chaim (life).

Since the redemption consists of four stages, as alluded to by the four terms of <em>geulah</em> in Shemos 6, and by the four cups drunk during the Pesach seder, therefore, four times in Tanach, the name יצחק is changed to ישחק. (Yermiyahu 33:26, Amos 7:9, 7:16, Tehillim 105:9.)

Yom Tov as well is sometimes refered to as shabbos and while some of the restrictions regarding melacha are less strict for yom tov we apply the same reasoning to holidays as well. In regards to chol hamoed there is a dispute. Ashkenazim typically do while Sephardim and many Chassidim do not wear tefillin on chol haMoed.

Further, he says, even those - including Rashi - who implicitly say that the wedding must be accompanied by teshuvah, would agree that even a thought of teshuvah counts for this purpose (thus the Midrash, Bereishis Rabbah 67:13, speaks of Eisav \"considering converting,\" even though in the end he didn't follow through).

And she said something like \"yeah, not exactly..\" and they broke off. What is the difference?</p>\n<p>Apologies if my question doesn't belong here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p><strong>Jewish</strong>: Is the person a Jew. According to halacha, this is defined by whether or not the person's mother was Jewish or they converted from another religion to Judaism (and according to some authorities, if the person did not convert from Judaism to another religion, since <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7775\">according to some</a> this would mean that they are no longer Jewish).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Zionist</strong>: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harder to define</a>, and different people would give it different meanings. My attempt to define it would be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The belief that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eretz_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Land of Israel</a> belongs to the Jewish people and that it is the ideal place for a Jew to live (what some might call Jewish Nationalism).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Zionism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Secular Zionism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Religious Zionism</a> would diverge on what is the basis for this belief (SZ would base it more on national history while RZ would base it more on scriptural and halachic sources). </li>\n<li>Some would find it important to also distinguish between those who believe that Jews should be settling the Land of Israel before the redemptive process has been completed (ie: today - see Secular and Religious Zionists above), while others (who would bristle at being labeled with the term Zionist - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satmar_(Hasidic_dynasty)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Satmar Hasidim</a> being the easiest example) acknowledge the importance of the Land of Israel, but do not think that Jews belong there before the redemptive process has completed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So if a person says that they are not Jewish but are a Zionist, then they are saying that they do not fit the requirements of being a Jew (or even if they do, they are themselves agnostic and couldn't care well about in what category halacha would place them), yet despite this they believe that Israel is for the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Judaism is a religion with established (though somewhat flexible) emotions and practices of serving G-d.  It is binding on those who are born into it.  Some practice more, some less, some not at all.</p>\n\n<p>Zionism is a belief in the importance of Eretz Yisrael which guides the emphases of emotions and practices within the religion and within life.  </p>\n\n<p>Some one who is born in America (and stays) is bound by the Constitution.  There are different ideas about how to practice the Constitution (conservative, libertarian, socialist, etc.)  Someone who is not a naturalized citizen can have a great respect for the country as well as an ideal of how the laws should be practiced.  They can even hold demonstrations to try to affect society even if they can't vote.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way, a non-Jew can have opinions about ideology of Jewish religion or life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Wow, some very interesting opinions here.  With all due respect, I beg to differ.  Zionism is not hard to define, and it is not a religious belief.  Zionism is Jewish nationalism, plain and simple.  Zionism is a belief that Jews, like all other peoples, have the right of self-determination in their historic homeland, Eretz Yisrael.  It is a belief that Jews have the right to govern themselves in their own country.</p>\n\n<p>Defining what it means to be Jewish, on the other hand, is a bit tricky.  On the one hand, there is a simple halachic definition: a Jew is a person whose mother is a Jew, or a person who converted to Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, who the Jews are as a group somewhat depends on who you ask.  Most Americans will tell you that Jews are a religious group, like Catholics or Muslims.  But most Russians will tell you that Jews are an ethnic group, like the Russians, the French, or the Japanese.  Surprisingly, while it is perfectly normal for somebody to be both Jewish and American at the same time, the notions of being Russian and being Jewish are mutually exclusive.  There are historic reasons for that, which deserve a whole separate discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I believe that Jews are an ethnic group, and that one can not stop being Jewish any more than one can stop being Italian.  While the food, the customs, and the languages of different Jewish communities vary widely, they have always been distinct from those of non-Jews.  Because of that, I think it makes sense to talk about a very diverse, but nevertheless a very distinct Jewish culture.  </p>\n\n<p>Having said that, I am not dismissing religion at all.  The ethnic and the religious components of the Jewish identity are virtually inseparable.  It is Judaism that is the common heritage of all Jewish communities all over the world, which provides the core basis for the Jewish culture.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to your question. To me it makes no sense for somebody who is \"demographically\" Jewish to say \"I am not Jewish...\".  On the other hand, it is certainly possible for one to be Jewish and to be against the idea of a Jewish state, as much as I would disagree with such a person.  Or one can be a non-Jew and agree that Jews, like all other peoples have the right of self-determination, and thus be a Zionist.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Berachos over food mixtures\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My breakfast regularly presents me with a beracha conundrum.  It usually consists of a bowl of bran flakes (<em>mezonos</em>), often sprinkled with raisins (<em>etz</em>) and/or sunflower seeds (<em>adama</em>), and occasionally some cornflakes (<em>shehakol</em>, since they are processed beyond recognition as corn).  And of course, all mixed in with milk (more <em>shehakol</em>).</p>\n\n<p>I heard that the correct thing to do when you have a mixture like this is to go after the majority of the mixture, and say the beracha of that food to cover the entire dish.  I also heard that if there's <em>mezonos</em> involved, even a minority, the whole dish automatically becomes <em>mezonos</em>.  Does anyone have a source for either of these <em>halachos</em> - or different opinions?</p>\n\n<p>Then, after finishing up my bowl - or even midway through it - what if I get an urge to munch a handful of raisins?  Or drink a glass of milk?  Assuming I made the beracha of <em>mezonos</em> on the bowl of cereal, which included the raisins and milk therein, must I make a new <em>beracha</em> on the glass of milk or plain raisins?</p>\n\n<p>And what about the <em>beracha acharona</em>?  When I say <em>al hamichya</em>, should I also include <em>al haetz</em> for the raisins?  If there was a <em>kezayis</em> of cornflakes, or a <em>revi'is</em> of milk in the bowl, must I also make a <em>borei nefashos</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Arrrggh!  Maybe it would just be easier to make <em>hamotzi</em> and be done with it...!</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. Sorry about the untranslated jargon.  I know Judaism.SE is supposed to be user-friendly to beginners, but this question is just too complicated to dejargonify...)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Essentially you are asking \"what are the laws of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikar_v%27tafel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ikar V'tafel</a>?\"</p>\n<p>Indeed they are quite complex. I'll be following your question while I answer this. Don't treat this as a definitive guide, but this will contain lots of info that'll help your case. (and as always <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CYLOR</a>)</p>\n<h2>Determining Ikar vs. Tafel</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I heard that the correct thing to do when you have a mixture like this is to go after the majority of the mixture, and say the beracha of that food to cover the entire dish. I also heard that if there's mezonos involved, even a minority, the whole dish automatically becomes mezonos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You heard correct, but that's incomplete. Here's how it generally works (by generally I mean to exclude certain other types of Ikar V'tafel):</p>\n<h3>Foods containing Wheat, Spelt, Oats, Rye, or Barley</h3>\n<p>If a food contains one of the 5 species of grain (not e.g. rice) we generally simply say that the Mezonos is Ikar and all the other foods are tafel.</p>\n<p>However, there are cases the grain is not there for nourishment or flavor, but for some external purpose (like a binder). For example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefilte_fish\" rel=\"noreferrer\">gefilte fish</a> is Shehakol even though it contains grain.</p>\n<h3>Other foods</h3>\n<p>The first step is to determine which of the foods is the <em>ikar</em> (i.e. the food specifically desired). The <em>tafel</em> is the food that is used to enhance the other food. This of course is subjective.</p>\n<p>In cases where there is no clear <em>ikar</em>, we then look for the majority. E.g. a fruit cocktail: it would be very hard to say one fruit is the main. So we would look for the majority fruit and make the Bracha on that.</p>\n<h2>Extent of Ikar V'tafel Exemption</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then, after finishing up my bowl - or even midway through it - what if I get an urge to munch a handful of raisins? Or drink a glass of milk? Assuming I made the beracha of mezonos on the bowl of cereal, which included the raisins and milk therein, must I make a new beracha on the glass of milk or plain raisins?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the case of cereal with milk, the cereal is generally the ikar and milk tafel. In such cases, the cereal exempts the milk, and even a small amount of milk that's leftover in the bowl. <strong>However,</strong> if one purposely added a \"considerable amount\" of milk to the cereal because he/she wants to drink the milk, then another bracha may be required for the milk as well.</p>\n<p>According to this, it would appear (I don't have a source) that in your case - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fortiori_argument\" rel=\"noreferrer\">all the more so</a> - you should make a separate bracha for the milk. [It would be super-hard to say that the milk in the glass is being drunk to enhance the cereal].</p>\n<p>As far as fruits in cereal: raisins, and other small bits of fruit would seem to be tafel (provided they are serving the \"enhancing\" function). Bananas and larger are a bit more complicated... (<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CYLOR</a> here)</p>\n<h2>Bracha Achronah in Ikar V'tafel</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what about the beracha acharona? When I say al hamichya, should I also include al haetz for the raisins?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once again a fascinating question. Generally speaking both the Bracha Rishona <strong>and</strong> Achronah are covered by the Ikar (and exempt the Tafel) - provided it's a case of ikar v'tafel. So no.</p>\n<p>However, the exception (which would rarely apply here) would be where you eat less than the proper shiur of the ikar. In such case, since you cannot say a bracha achronah for the ikar, you would say it on the tafel (assuming a proper shiur was eaten).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If there was a kezayis of cornflakes, or a revi'is of milk in the bowl, must I also make a borei nefashos?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. Assuming you're asking \"do I need a bracha achronah on the tafel as well?\", see what I wrote before. If not, please explain in comments...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arrrggh! Maybe it would just be easier to make hamotzi and be done with it...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Believe it or not, that would also be a case of Ikar V'tafel (although a simpler one).</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=75\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igros Moshe א\"ח ח\"ד סימן מ\"ג </a> writes that the milk is exempt only if it used to help eat the cereal.

I do not want to turn this forum into an ugly place. I realize this question is controversial, I will not be angry if it is closed by moderators. It would seem to me that this is a forum for believers which I am not and so my question is perhaps out of place. However any comments would be helpful including references to other material.</p>\n\n<p>Further the term 'racist' has an emotionally negative connotation. I am not trying to cast judgment. I am trying to better understand Judaism. For the sake of this question I 'racism' should not be considered a dirty concept.</p>\n\n<p>It has always seemed to me that the fundamental tenets of the Jewish religion and of the state of Israel shared much with other doctrines of racial preference.</p>\n\n<p>There would seem to be within Judaism a belief that Jews should help out other Jews with a heightened sense of urgency (vis a vis a non-Jew). Because Jews consider being Jewish is considered to be an ethnic identity this would imply that a good Jew is a 'racist' Jew. (Again I do not cast judgment, I only seek understanding).</p>\n\n<p>--begin edit--</p>\n\n<p>(One of the moderators asked that I expand upon the above section.)</p>\n\n<p>It is hard for me to denote a specific example without it being an event from my own life, which is of course not a large enough sample set and so I feel is not a fair representation. You could say the above is a sense I get from working with, living amongst and speaking with persons who are 'actively Jewish.' Amongst those I know who are not 'actively Jewish' there is much less attention paid to the identity of others and and commentary or benefit associated with that identity. </p>\n\n<p>I will provide a specific example reluctantly as I feel it casts judgment. I have had two bosses who identified as Jews, one actively Jewish (attended synagogue and gave to AIPAC substantially) and another not actively Jewish (non-kosher, did not celebrate holidays, but identified as being a 'Jew'). The actively Jewish boss had mostly Jews in positions of power in the firm (myself excepted although I am often mistaken for being Jewish and may have been so at the time of hire). The other boss had a mix of people, and in fact I believe none were Jewish except for himself. The actively Jewish person viewed interactions with others as being very colored by his own Jewish identity or the Jewish or non-Jewish identity of the other party. The inactively Jewish person did not. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this is helpful. I very much appreciate your taking my question seriously. It is a very sincere question and I very much desire to gain wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>--end edit--</p>\n\n<p>This is my guess: </p>\n\n<p>One central tenet of Judaism is that of Jewish identity. To protect this concept of Jewish identity certain racist practices and rules have evolved over the years to maintain and protect the religion from the diluting powers of assimilation and intermarriage. In addition, because of the collapse of the temple Jews were spread out around the world and therefore were often strangers in other countries. Like any group in such a situation there was a need to 'stick together' as members of the 'native' communities were often hostile.</p>\n\n<p>I thank you in advance for helping me to better understand Jews and Judaism so that I can better appreciate one of the worlds oldest and richest cultures.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 35)\n\n<p>There are a lot of good answers here - I especially like @YDK's point about \"taking a bullet\" for someone really close to you, and not just anybody.  I want to expand on this, because I feel this will cut to the heart of what @Seeker is asking.</p>\n\n<p>I think behind the questions of racism/nepotism/ethnocentrism, @Seeker has noticed a particular thing about Jews that I don't believe exists among other nations or religions.  An American multinational employer will typically not feel any inclination to give a job to a fellow American over a Briton, just because they share nationality.  On a religious level, from what I've heard, a Baptist will typically not think to discharge his obligation to pray by going to a nearby Anglican church.  Muslim current affairs is all about (often bloody) power struggles between Shiites, Sunnis, Wahhabis etc.  </p>\n\n<p>But with Jews it <strong>is</strong> different.  For all our tendency to bicker and fight among ourselves, we nonetheless have an overarching philosophy such that if any ten Jews get together on a street corner, whether Hungarian chassidim, Yemenites, Lithuanian charedim, Moroccans, Persians, Religious Zionists or converts from Sweden, they together will form a <em>minyan</em> (prayer quorum) and pray to the One G-d together; there is an automatic kinship such that one Jew will instinctively and viscerally feel a responsibility for his fellow Jew, even if they have never met before, and come from totally different cultural backgrounds.  It's not just a prescribed, intellectualized duty that we're \"supposed\" to look out for each other - this Jewish kinship simply <strong>is</strong>, in a very real, tangible and observable way.  Hence the question, which I agree cannot be applied to other religions or nationalities, because the phenomenon does not exist anywhere else to nearly the same degree as it does with Jews.</p>\n\n<p>As to why this kinship exists to such a palpable degree, beyond that which could have been expected simply from having the legislation of how to deal with your fellow Jews, my speculation is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Case 1: Two strangers get on an airplane and sit next to each other.  They exchange niceties, maybe some idle chit-chat during the flight, then get off at the destination and say goodbye.</p>\n\n<p>Case 2: Two strangers get on an airplane and sit next to each other.  Just after they take off, the flight is hijacked, and a hostage crisis ensues.  Hollywood-style plot of negotiations, gunfights, dramatic rescues.  Stranger 1 rescues stranger 2 from certain death.  Stranger 2 tackles the main hijacker and saves the day.  Days later glory turns to shock and disbelief as the hijackers sue the victims for assault and millions of dollars of damages caused.  The mass media takes the side of the hijackers - as do many of the other passengers (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome\">Stockholm Syndrome</a>).  Only the two strangers are there to stick up for each other.  Eventually they are exonerated and vindicated.</p>\n\n<p>Now which pair of strangers is going to feel a closer bond to each other, for the rest of their lives?  If the one subsequently goes broke, will the other not do everything in his power to help him find a job and get back on his feet?  Will they not automatically invite each other to their respective children's weddings?  Should they need anyone to tell them that \"it's the right thing to do\", to come and comfort him in the house of mourning?</p>\n\n<p>So it is with the Jewish people: we have an enormously long shared history as a nation.  From the Egyptian exile, through the First Commonwealth, through the Babylonian exile, through the Second Commonwealth, through to our current days, we have been through all the ups and downs together.  It's not just about here and now.  A \"here-and-now\" Jew, who regards his history as a matter of mere intellectual interest (or less), will not feel this connection to his fellow Jews any more than one American would feel towards another American.  But any Jew who has a sense of national history and purpose, without even thinking about it understands that his fellow Jews have been through that history with him, and automatically feels a closeness that cannot and need not be legislated or otherwise imposed.

I think the best one is איוב לח:ו-ז או מי ירה עבן פנתה ברן יחד כוכבי בקר  ויריעו כל בני אלהים (\"... or who laid the foundation [of the earth], when the morning stars sang and the 'benei elohim' shouted for joy?\") Rashi there says that this refers to the time when the morning stars were created. Of course, you would then have to identify the morning stars with angels, when in fact the classical commentators seem to assume that they're actually stars (and Malbim says that this is the \"music of the spheres\"). Otherwise this is in fact an anti-proof, because the בני אלהים are identified (e.g., by the Targum, Metzudat David, and Metzudat Tzion) as being angels - and <em>they</em> only shout!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, these lines are actually quoted by our Gemara (\"ואין מה\"ש אומרים שירה למעלה עד שיאמרו ישראל למטה שנאמר ברן יחד כוכבי בקר והדר ויריעו כל בני אלהים\") which understands (see Rashi there) the כוכבים to be the Jews, presumably based on the blessings given to אברהם אבינו, and the Gemara midrashically interprets this to mean that the Jews get to \"sing\" the Shema before the angels sing, say, or chant קדוש. </p>\n\n<p>So my answer is: there is <em>no</em> passage in תנ\"ך that explicitly says angels sing, even though there are <em>many</em> places where it says humans sang, must sing, or will sing!

There is much discussion about these concepts amongst the Sages of the Talmud, the Rishonim, and Acharonim.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heaven:</strong> There is much reference in Talmudic literature to an afterlife for the righteous (i.e. those who follow God's commandments) called \"Olam Habah\" (World to Come). The Rishonim generally describe it as a pure spiritual connection between the soul and God's \"essence\", generating an intimate relationship with God. This is something that one in this world cannot imagine. (See Rambam Hil. Teshuva 8:6-7; Chovos Hal'vavos, Bitachon:4.)</li>\n<li><strong>Hell:</strong> The afterlife of those who sinned is referred to in the Talmud as \"Gehinnom\", which is a reference to a geographical location mentioned several times in Tanach (גיא בן הינום), though the concept of which is purely spiritual and divorced from any physicality. Several (metaphorical) descriptions of Gehinnom are given, such as it being fiery (Berachos 57b) or a period of continuous unrest (Pirkei R' Eliezer 34). Rambam seems to believe that there is no afterlife for sinners, but that they will rather cease to exist after death. (See @RCW's answer.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Second, with regard to your question, <code>Were these part of Judaism from beginning?</code>. Following the Jewish belief in the oral tradition imparted by Moshe through the Neviim and through the Sages of the Mishna and the Talmud, we must assume that these concepts are part of the tradition received by Chazal, and thus were indeed part of Judaism from its beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, regarding your second question, there is no definite reference to the concepts of Olam Habah or Gehinnom in the Tanach. There are, however, hints and inferences to them. The source that is generally used to show that there is a concept of afterlife, that is, the continued spiritual existence of the soul after death, is from Koheles 12:7:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וישב העפר על הארץ כשהיה והרוח תשוב אל האלהים אשר נתנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, Chazal counted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail\">Abigail</a> among the female prophets and assumed her knowledge of the afterlife, both its positive and negative sides, from her words in Shmuel 1:25:29:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיתה נפש אדני צרורה בצרור החיים את יהוה אלהיך ואת נפש איביך יקלענה בתוך כף הקלע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To address why there is no (definitive) mention of the afterlife throughout Tanach, R' Dessler (Michtav Me'Eliyahu vol. 5, p. 391) explains that in the earlier generations, when there existed prophesy and God's presence dwelled on Earth (in the Temple), there was no need to depict Olam Habah. People's perception of the world was of a continuous existence of the soul; they were simply more in touch with their spirituality and connection to God than people of later generations. To the earlier generations, this world was seen as just an Olam Habah with an added physical aspect. There was not so much of a distinction drawn between the two worlds. Therefore, it warranted no mention in those times; it was a given.  Later, after the destruction of the Temple and discontinuation of prophesy, people had to grapple with the concepts of Olam Habah and Gehinnom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Scholars discuss why the Pentateuch does not directly mention the existence of worlds other than this one (though it does hint or refer to it in a couple of places). Some give reasons why these concepts are meant to be a part of the oral torah and not in the written Torah. Some rishonim say that these concepts would have been too abstract for the generation of the desert to grasp, so the Torah emphasized physical reward in this world  to them. \n(This answer is difficult if one says belief in a future world is essential. If however, the critical belief is just in reward and punishment, then it works.) \nMany non-Orthodox Jews reject the idea of ancient oral traditions in Judaism, which may be why they would say these concepts didn't use to exist. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I believe the concept of gan eden/gehinam are part of the oral tradition. at least there's no clear reference in the humash.\nin any case the concept of gan eden/gehinam is not the same as heaven/hell that is brought by different religions</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hebrew for ice - and other \"new\" words\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After reading <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=161\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MB OC 301:17:65</a> (thanks, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7797/is-it-actually-forbidden-to-push-a-wheelchair-outside-of-an-eruv-on-shabbat/7800#7800\">YDK</a>!) I am baffled by a nagging question regarding Modern Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Ben-Yehuda\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eliezer Ben-Yehudah</a> is known to have revitalized Hebrew, in part by taking Biblical and post-Biblical (often Mishnaic and/or Rabbinic) Hebrew words, and sometimes Aramaic words, and adapting them to modern uses. But there are words that are not new to the world, and certainly could not have been new to our ancestors, which he apparently adapted from the classical sources because he could not find evidence of them there but found similar words that could be made to apply. The example I'm trying to understand is the Hebrew word for \"ice\".</p>\n\n<p>In the Mishnah Berurah above why did the M\"B need to describe ice as \"water which has frozen\"? Furthermore, why did he have to Hebraicize the Aramaic word for \"freeze\"? Is there no classical Hebrew word for \"ice\" or even \"freeze\"? According to <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0131.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0131.htm</a> \"קֶרַח\" translates as \"frost\". According to <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/גלד</a> the word \"גלד\" is Aramaic for \"freeze\" and Hebrew (presumably modern) for \"scab\". I have also seen elsewhere in my search today that \"גלד\" is also used in the context of congealing (I believe in Hebrew).</p>\n\n<p>Is there no other classical Hebrew source for a word that translates directly as \"ice\"? It seems almost inconceivable that our ancestors did not have a word for this. Is it just that the word is unknown because our sources are limited to Biblical and post-Biblical writings?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There is at least one possible usage of קרח in Tanach in the sense of \"ice\" - Ezek. 1:22 (כעין הקרח הנורא), which Targum Yonasan translates as גליד חסין, \"strong ice.\" [Metzudos also renders some other instances of קרח as גליד, the Talmudic word for ice (from the root גלד, as you noted), as in Mikvaos 7:1 and Bava Basra 20a.]</p>\n\n<p>To follow up on msh210's point, though: if (supposedly) the Eskimos need lots of words for snow, then people living in the temperate climate of Eretz Yisrael may have needed only one word meaning \"frozen water\" generally, and then the words כפור and ברד to describe particular kinds of frozen precipitation. Alternatively, the word גליד may have existed in Biblical times too and just wasn't recorded. Which isn't as odd as it sounds: cats are pretty common in the Land of Israel too, but there is no word for \"cat\" in Tanach (the word חתול is attested only in Mishnaic and later Hebrew).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Although קרח can refer to frost, in certain instances it refers to ice and is translated as such by Artscroll as well as Mechon-Mamre, like <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2737.htm\">Iyov 37:10</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1201.htm\">Yechezkel 1:22</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26e7.htm\">Tehillim 147:17</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I noticed that that mechon-mamre translates יתלכדו of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2738.htm\">Iyov 38:30</a> as \"frozen\" even though Artscroll translated it as \"imprisoned\". On the other hand, Artscrol translates מים במוצק of Iyov 37:10 as \"water becomes solidified\", while mechon translated it as \"straitened\".</p>\n\n<p>Even if there are words for ice and freezing in biblical hebrew, though, I can see why Mishna Berura would be reluctant to use them, as they're quite obscure, and likely not to be understood by the average reader.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.320.9-10?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see</a> the Shulchan Aruch O.C. 320:9-10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ט השלג והברד אין מרסקין אותם דהיינו לשברם לחתיכות דקות כדי שיזובו\n  מימיו אבל נותן הוא לתוך כוס של יין או מים והוא נימח מאיליו ואינו חושש\n  וכן אם הניחם בחמה או כנגד המדורה ונפשרו מותרים:   י  מותר לשבר הקרח\n  כדי ליטול מים מתחתיו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are three words being used in these two halachos: שלג, ברד and קרח.</p>\n\n<p>שלג and ברד are used in the gemara (שבת נא) which is the source of halacha 9.</p>\n\n<p>The source for the term קרח here is the sefer אבי עזרי being quoted by the מרדכי and שיבולי הלקט as sourced in the בית יוסף. And when referencing these rishonim, it doesn't seem like there's a need to explain what קרח is (the בית יוסף doesn't translate the word, etc.) In fact, in the previous halacha (about the ברד ושלג) the בית יוסף discusses all three terms in relation to each other.</p>\n\n<p>So clearly at least during the times of the rishonim the word קרח meant ice.\nWhich means that the Mishna Berurah 301:65 could definitely have used this word if he wanted to.</p>\n\n<p>Why didn't he? First off, the question is not really on the Mishnah Berurah; he's just quoting the Taz 301:12. </p>\n\n<p>So why did the Taz write this way?\nI don't have a definite answer. But it's possible that he wanted to describe the situation to explain why it's dangerous and why someone would need a cane. Elderly men don't walk on frozen rivers, but they would walk on an area which was wet and froze over. </p>\n\n<p>So he didn't mention \"ice\" but rather \"frozen water.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's also possible that the Taz wanted to use the Yiddish word since that was how it was called in the vernacular and he wanted it to be understood by the common people.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Forbidden actions and the role of non-Jews\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The question I am to ask is related to personal experience I've had but can be easily broadened. I am really asking for the sake of broadening my knowledge, and I apologize if any part of my question is offending as it is really not my intent.</p>\n\n<p>As a non-jewish person, I have been asked by jewish people on Shabbat day to switch a water boiler on. The same thing happened to a friend, except he was asked to turn the lights on.</p>\n\n<p>Although we both complied gracefully, I am wondering: is asking a non-Jew to perform such forbidden actions legal ? \nIf so, how would things turn out in a society where everybody is a Jew and complies to the laws ?</p>\n\n<p>I can't help but feel that either me doing what I did or them asking me to do them was somewhat unethical.\nHowever, I can also imagine that boiling water could be necessary for such urgent need as feeding a baby or tending to wounds. In such a case, does the law provide other workarounds ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 24)\n\n<p>There are many restrictions placed upon Jews on Shabbat that prevent them from doing even relatively simple things like switching on a light or heating up some food, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Although biblically there is no prohibition against a non-Jew doing something for a Jew on Shabbat, to keep the spirit of Shabbat, and as a safeguard against violating it, the Sages prohibited a <em>melacha</em> (form of work prohibited on Shabbat) to be done by a non-Jew for a Jew on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>However, this rabbinic prohibition is only violated if one of two things occurs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Jew asks the non-Jew outright to do a <em>melacha</em> for him. This includes a command, request, significant gesture, or even answering \"yes\" if the non-Jew asks, \"Do you want me to do such-and-such?\"</li>\n<li>The Jew derives direct benefit from the <em>melacha</em> performed by the non-jew. This means that the benefit obtained by the Jew is a <strong>direct consequence</strong> of the <em>melacha</em> performed by the non-jew. This would not include, though, a <em>melacha</em> which removes an obstacle thereby allowing the Jew to derive benefit; <em>that</em> is called indirect benefit.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In order for the <em>melacha</em> done by the non-jew to be permissible, it must be done in a way which avoids <strong>both</strong> the above conditions. A classic example is to hint to a non-jew to turn <strong><em>off</em></strong> the light in a bedroom so that a Jew may sleep there by saying \"The light was accidentally left on in my room. I will have trouble sleeping.\" There was no explicit command or request, so #1 is avoided, and turning off a light is considered indirect benefit, since it removes the obstacle (light) which prevented the Jew from deriving benefit (ability to sleep). So #2 is also avoided. Thus, this case is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the non-Jew was asked to do so outright, or if he turned <strong>on</strong> a light in a room for the benefit of a Jew even without being asked at all, both of these cases are prohibited (by conditions #1 and #2 respectively), and the Jew may not derive benefit from the non-Jew's actions.</p>\n\n<p>Two other important exceptions to this rule are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Jew may hint to a non-Jew to perform a <em>melacha</em> for the sake of a communal <em>mitzva</em>, even where direct benefit will be derived by the community. That is, even though #1 must still be avoided, #2 is not a problem. For example, one may <strong>hint to</strong> a non-Jew to turn on the lights in a synagogue for communal prayers even though turning on a light is considered direct benefit.</li>\n<li>For the sake of a sick person, direct benefit may be derived from a <em>melacha</em> done by a non-Jew, though again, he may not be asked outright. [How \"sick\" a person has to be for this exception to apply is a matter of discussion, but it should be noted that there is no doubt that in the case of life threatening illnesses, no time should be wasted asking others to do <em>melachos</em>, rather a Jew is <em>obligated</em> to save the dying person by any means necessary.]</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>To add just a little to jake's excellent <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7834/forbidden-actions-and-the-role-of-non-jews/7835#7835\">explanation</a> of the relevant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Halachic</a> rules:</p>\n<p>It's important to remember that Jews are required to adhere to many commandments and restrictions that God set up to apply specifically to Jews. Roughly speaking, these particularistic commandments are not statements of universal ethics or morality; they're statements of God's particular mission for the Jews.</p>\n<p>For example, regarding the Sabbath restrictions, God tells Moses (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9892\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 31</a>:13-17):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And you, speak to the children of Israel and say: 'Only keep My Sabbaths! For it is a sign between Me and you for your generations, to know that I, the Lord, make you holy.</p>\n<p>Therefore, keep the Sabbath, for it is a sacred thing for you. Those who desecrate it shall be put to death, for whoever performs work on it, that soul will be cut off from the midst of its people.</p>\n<p>Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the Lord; whoever performs work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.'</p>\n<p>Thus shall the children of Israel observe the Sabbath, to make the Sabbath throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant.</p>\n<p>Between Me and the children of Israel, it is forever a sign that [in] six days The Lord created the heaven and the earth, and on the seventh day He ceased and rested.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's clear from this language that the Sabbath represents a particular covenant between God and the Jewish people, which the Jews observe as a perpetual testimony to God as Creator. For whatever reason, God chose to only require the Jews to fill this role, not all of humanity. So, universally speaking, is doing work on the Sabbath day a bad thing? No. If you're subject to a covenant that forbids it, is doing it a bad thing then? Yes.</p>\n<p>So, in these terms, your question boils down to \"Is a Jew asking a gentile to perform acts that are forbidden for the Jew on the Sabbath compatible with the Jews' Sabbath covenant or not?\" Intrinsically, there's no problem; the Jew's personal restraint in this situation fulfills the covenant. However, as jake explained in detail, the Rabbis eventually legislated additional restrictions so that Jews won't see their work getting done on the Sabbath and forget about their special role.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>There is a vital and simple set of rules I'd like to point out here. 1st, I assume a Gentile is either a family member (-in-law) or an invited guest. Such people should know about the traditional function of a Shabbos goy, even if only for the fun of it. I'm not sure I am clear about the situation presented in the original question....</p>\n\n<p>As to that, I'd say any Gentile ought to be very vigilant, especially if the person is very close to the family. That Gentile ought to watch for necessities that Jews cannot perform should those necessities arise. Then the Gentile may do the action with ZERO prompting. If you followed my advice, well, out the window with rabbinical migraines!</p>\n\n<p>A final note: any Jew not knowing what he's doing halachically needs to find the guidance of a rabbi, and FAST. It's one thing to be tangled up in a silly little matter of Law, but if you can't even handle Shabbos...well!</p>\n\n\n",

I.e. they would not be problemaic.</p>\n\n<p>(also, assuming Shemittah is not a problem)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Sorry for not being clear. I meant assuming the worst possible situation (i.e. the stuff that are absolutely kosher with minimal hechsher). Or to put it another way: stuff that don't have any \"questionable\" problems - only \"universal\" problems.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously stuff that never need a hechsher (e.g. water) would be included in this category. But I'd prefer those stuff that are normally non-kosher without any Hechsher, but by having just a minimal standard of Hechsher, everyone would eat it.</p>\n\n<p>If such things do not exist, then that would be a valid (although, disappointing) answer too.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Aside from Rav Moshe Feinstein's responsa permitting govt-supervised milk as <em>Chalav Yisrael</em>, there are other traditions that milk from non-kosher animals will not curdle (no citation, sorry), so any curdled milk products (yoghurt, cheese) would be kosher with non-mehadrin hechsher according to those opinions.  Likewise powdered milk - but again I can't give a citation.</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbanut always puts a warning on \"heter mechira\" products, so if fruit/veg products have a Rabbanut hechsher but no such warning, you can assume that there's no shemita issue.  If you're concerned about <em>teruma</em> and <em>maaser</em> (tithes) - you can take tithes yourself as <em>demai</em> (possibly untithed produce) - i.e. without a beracha.</p>\n\n<p>Bread products - if you're worried about <em>challah</em>, you can take challah yourself.  Once the Rabbanut has approved it without a <em>heter mechira</em> warning, I can't imagine anything else going wrong with the ingredients.  In any case, I heard that almost all Israeli wheat is exported, and the flour used for baking our bread is low-grade imported stuff (without any issues of <em>shemitta</em> or tithes).</p>\n\n<p>AFAIK all Scotch whisky is kosher without any hechsher.</p>\n\n<p>That's what I can think of for now; may edit later as I think of other things... :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are some things that according to everyone you would be able to eat/drink even without a hechsher, so in light of Isaac Moses's comment, I guess that must be what you mean.</p>\n\n<p>Examples are: plain beer (unflavored, no additives), bourbon, milk in the US i.e. milk that was milked in the US (according to rav moshe, but there is some discussion if there is still meertas (a fear of the USDA that they will shut the plant down) so some do not hold by it).</p>\n\n\n",

Basically, he says, an army's lead unit (\"what people call in the vernacular the 'avant-garde'\") and rear unit have to be large in size to repel attackers, while the flanks can be smaller. In keeping with this, Yehudah's camp had the greatest number of people, Dan's the second largest, and the other two had fewer people.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The repetition of the names of the leaders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Malbim (to 2:5) says that the second counting of the three tribes of Yissachar, Zevulun and Reuven was overseen by their respective nesi'im, and therefore each of these tribes' population is described with the word ופקדיו (\"and his enumeration\") - by contrast with the others, which are described with ופקודיהם (\"and their enumeration\"). So those three leaders had to be mentioned again. He doesn't say anything about the other nine (just that those tribes handled the re-counting themselves), but presumably once the Torah had to repeat the names of some, it continues the same throughout.</p></li>\n<li><p>It's also possible (though I don't know any source for this) that with the information in ch. 1 we might have thought that they were designated only to oversee the census, but not to lead their respective tribes when traveling and encamping. Repeating their names in ch. 2 makes it clear that they are in charge for all purposes. (This might also explain the repetition of the census figures - to clarify the scope of each one's responsibility.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do a few tribes in a list have different trope from the rest?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the first aliya of B'midbar the chiefs of the tribes are listed.  Nine have the zakeif gadol trope and three -- Yisachar, Binyamin, and Naftali -- have different trope.  This isn't driven by word count (e.g. the Yosef tribes, even though they have more words, still use the same trope, just with some additions).</p>\n\n<p>I wondered if there were something special about these three tribes that the trope is trying to call out.  Another place where representatives of tribes are listed is in Sh'lach l'cha, and there also there is a majority trope with some variation -- but it's not the same tribes there (Yehudah and Manashe there).</p>\n\n<p>Why do these three tribes have different trope in B'midbar?  Is there a meaning or is it just melodic variation?  And if there is meaning behind it, where can I find commentaries that address it?  Most of the common commentaries (or at least the ones I have) focus on text and don't address trope.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The alternation you are speaking of is between a zakef-gadol (on the many shorter names) and a ‘pashta’–zakef-katon (on somewhat longer names). These are grammatically identical. When the zakef comes on the first word of a clause, as it does here, then there is no place for the servus. This is where we typically see a zakef-gadol.</p>\n<p>The ‘pashta’–zakef-katon is caused by purely musical concerns, based on characteristics of the syllables. But it is really just an equivalent of the zakef-gadol. Here is what <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=bIgrAAAAMAAJ&dq=wickes%20cantillation&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q=vorschlag&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">William Wickes</a> has to say about it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If there is a closed syllable in the word, separated by one or more others—or, at least, by vocal Sh'va—from the tone-syllable, an emphatic intonation (a <em>high</em> tone, as the position of its sign above the word implies) was introduced, serving as a forebeat (<em>Vorschlag</em>) to Zaqeph, in the absence of the foretone. It was known as <em>Methiga</em>, being like an upper Metheg (comp. the use of the term in the accentuation of the three books, <em>Taamei Emeth</em>, pg. 70).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Keep reading at the link for more information about the <em>Methiga</em>. But consider: Le-<strong>Yis</strong>-sa(s?)-<strong>char</strong>. That is a closed syllable, <em>Yis</em>, separated by one other syllable—<em>sa</em>—from the tone syllable, <em>char</em>. This is also true for Binyamin—<em>Bin</em>, a closed syllable, <em>ya</em>, a separating syllable, and <em>min</em>, the tone syllable—And for Naftali: <em>Naf</em>, a closed syllable, <em>ta</em>, a separating syllable, and <em>li</em>, the tone syllable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Although the Gra is famous for saying that there is <em>remez</em> (symbolism) behind all the ta'amim (trope) in the Torah, simply speaking the ta'amim are purely grammatical.</p>\n<p>There are several levels of “<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_cantillation#Syntax\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">stopper</a>\" ta'amim that indicate a pause in the text, i.e. that this word is not grammatically connected to the next. Grammatically speaking, <em>zakef gadol</em> and <em>kadma-zakef-katan</em> the same thing; the same level of pause. The only difference is that we use <em>kadma-zakef-katan</em> when we want an <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_stress\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">extra syllable to be stressed</a> earlier in the word as well.</p>\n<p>Usually, when a word is mil'ra (stressed on last syllable) and more than three syllables long, to keep with the melodic style of the Hebrew language, we will add a stress to an earlier syllable. These words will have their \"main\" stress on the last syllable, and a \"secondary\" stress (often indicated by a <em>meteg</em>) on the earlier syllable. [Example: The word \"נבוכדראצר\" is a name found often in Tanach with five syllables. It's primary stress is on the last syllable. Since it has more than three, we add a secondary stress to the second syllable.]</p>\n<p>Notice that in the beginning of Parshat Bammidbar, all the names of the tribes warrant a pausing ta'am to the level of <em>zakef gadol</em>. Most of them have only two or three syllables, so we merely place emphasis on the last syllables (they are all mil'ra) and place the <em>zakef gadol</em> ta'am there. However, a few tribes' names have more than three syllables (in the form here with a \"ל\" prefix), and thus we want to stress an additional syllable (usually the second one); so instead of <em>zakef gadol</em>, we use <em>kadma-zakef-katan</em>, placing the <em>zakef katan</em> part on the main stress and the <em>kadma</em> part on the earlier secondary stress.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are my notes: (I hope none of you will be at my Shiur. If you do, please don't spoil anything)</p>\n<p>The Rama brings down that the Minhag is to spread out grass in the Shuls and houses on Shavuos to remember the Simcha of Matan Torah.</p>\n<p>This minhag is already found in the Rishonim from the Maharil (1360 – 1427) who said that they would spread fragrant grass and roses for the Simcha of the regel, and he quoted that the Mahar”i Sega”l did the same. Additionally, the Leket Yosher (1423-1490) quotes that his Rebbe, the Terumas Hadeshen, used to spread grass and fragrant grass on the first day of Shavuos in the morning.\n(1) The Chid”a writes in Birkei Yosef that this there is a remez to this Minhag going all the way back to the Targum Sheini on Megillas Esther 3:8 (according to some Sefer I found on Otzar Hachochmah, Targum Sheini was written in the mid-500s) who writes that Haman told Achashverosh as part of his complaint about the Jewish people that they spread grass on Shavuos.</p>\n<p>(1.5) Targum Sheini says that Haman that Haman told Achashverosh as he was going through all the terrible things that we did on our Yomim Tovim that on Shavuos we would go to Shul, Daven Shema and Shemonah Esrei, read the Torah and do Haftara with Targum, curse the king, break his rule, and go up to the roof of the Shul and throw flowers and apples and then gather them and say that the same way that we gathered these flowers and apples, Hashem should gather us from among the gentiles. (This could potentially be a derababan issur of me’amer – bundling according to some opinions)</p>\n<p>The Nodeh Biyehuda (YD Tinyana 161) mentions that Tosfos in Avoda Zarah 33b d”h כסי learns from Haman’s Midrashic discussion of what the Jews did with wine Achashversoh touched that Hadacha three times works because the Jews would do Hadacha three times. Normally we don’t learn out Halachos from Aggados which are just there to give us mussar and teach us various lessons, and we definitely wouldn’t learn out Halachos from Haman, however, here all that’s happening is that he is documenting what the Jews did and there’s no problem with that.</p>\n<p>(2) The Maharil writes that we spread the fragrant grass and roses as a Zecher for the Simcha of the regel.</p>\n<p>(2.5) The Rama writes similar, but not exactly the same, that it’s for the Simcha of Matan Torah.</p>\n<p>(3) The Levush explains that it’s because grass grew around Har Sinai.\n(4) The Alshich explains that the Passuk says that Reuven picked the dudaim “בימי קציר חטים”. What does that have to do with anything? The same way that Pesach is the time for harvesting barley, it makes sense that Shavuos is the time for harvesting wheat, which would fit with the Korban. As such, it appears that Reuven must have picked the dudaim on Erev Shavuos so “לכן ישכב עמך הלילה תחת דודאי בנך” must be Shavuos night. That is why Yissachar was born that night, he is referred to as ben chamishi as a remez to chamusha chumshei Torah. (Makes it interesting that the Arizal says not to be together with one’s wife on Shavuos. Based on this Alshich it would seem like one should specifically be with their wife on Shavuos. Nitei Gavriel quotes the Yefeh Lev Chelek Hei 494:7 that it was actually Leah’s leil tevillah).</p>\n<p>(I haven’t looked into it enough but it’s also possible that Moshe’s conception was Shavuos because that’s nine months before 7 Adar. This wouldn’t fit with the Midrashim that he was born 3 months early, but I’m not sure if that’s a problem.)</p>\n<p>(5) I saw another potential source beshaim a Talmid of the Chassam Sofer in his Sefer Lekutei Chaver Ben Chaim that a is the Gemara in Shabbos which says that by each of the dibur that came from Hashem the world filled with fragrant spices, so we spread fragrant spices as a Zecher.</p>\n<p>(6) I also saw beshaim the Kemach Soles that “והדת ניתנה בשושן” is meramez that the דת – Torah, was given בשושן – with roses.</p>\n<p>(7) The Yefeh Leleiv (Os 7) writes that Rashi on Tehillim 45:1 writes that the Mizmor “למנצח על ששנים” was written lekavod the Talmidei Chachamim who are as soft as roses, beautiful as roses, and whose deeds are as fresh as roses.</p>\n<p>(8) The Bnei Yissaschar explains that there’s a Midrash Rabah (Vayikra Rabbah 23:3) that brings a Mashal to a king who found that his entire field was covered in thorns. He was going to destroy the whole thing until he found a rose growing in it, which he smelled and enjoyed. Then he said, “because of this rose, I’m going to save the whole vineyard”. So too, Hashem was going to destroy the world after 26 generations until he found Bnei Yisrael who said naaseh venishmah and Hashem said, because of this rose, the Bnei Yisrael, I will save the whole world. (Interestingly na’aseh venishmah is Shemos 24:7, which can hint that this has to guide our lives 24/7)</p>\n<p>(9) The Bnei Yissaschar suggests another Peshat that the sense of smell was the only sense that wasn’t ruined by the chet of the eitz hada’as and on Shavuos we went back to being fully spiritual beings, having undone the eitz hada’as and the sense of smell was on the highest level, having never been tainted.</p>\n<p>(10) I saw beshaim Rav Mordechai Benet (brought down in Pardes Yosef Shemos end of 2:3) that the reason we spread grass (not necessarily fragrant in many of the sources) is because Moshe was born on Zayin Adar and he was hidden for 3 months and then placed “בסוף על־שפת היאר” – “among the reeds by the bank of the Nile”, which works out Shavuos.</p>\n<p>(11-13) The Chassam Sofer (Drashos) breaks it into parts. We put out things that smell nice based on (Taanis 29b) “ויאמר ראה ריח בני כריח שדה אשר ברכו ה׳ אמר רב יהודה בריה דרב שמואל בר שילת משמיה דרב כריח שדה של תפוחים:” Tosfos 88a on the Gemara “אמר רבי חמא ברבי חנינא: מאי דכתיב ״כתפוח בעצי היער וגו׳״ — למה נמשלו ישראל לתפוח, לומר לך: מה תפוח זה פריו קודם לעליו, אף ישראל הקדימו ״נעשה״ ל״נשמע״.” Explains that Tapuach is an Esrog. Since at the time of maatan Torah we were compared to an Esrog which is known for its smell, we put out things that smell good.</p>\n<p>(See there for two more parts #1 - We spread grass on the floor based on (Tehillim 47:4) “ידבר עמים תחתינו ולאמים תחת רגלינו” – “He subjects peoples to us, sets nations at our feet.” And (Tehillim 92:8) “בפרח רשעים כמו עשב ויציצו כל־פעלי און להשמדם עדי־עד” – “though the wicked sprout like grass, though all evildoers blossom, it is only that they may be destroyed forever.” Shabbos 89b writes “דאמר רבי אבהו: ״הר סיני״ שמו. ולמה נקרא ״הר חורב״ — שירדה חורבה לאומות העולם עליו.” So on Har Sinai we were elevated and the other nations are under our feet. Also #2 – that we decorate the Beis Medresh with greenery because ירק is Gematriah 310…)</p>\n<p>(14) The Magen Avraham actually writes that the Minhag is to put out trees. The Magen Avraham gives the reason that on Shavuos we are judged on fruits of the tree so this will remind us to Daven for them.</p>\n<p>Some suggest that based on the Magen Avraham it should have to be fruit bearing trees. However, the Siach Yitzchak explains that because of the Issur to cut fruit bearing trees they avoided the whole thing and used barren trees which is still a Remez. (Some hold that there is even an Issur to cut the branches of fruit trees. See Piskei Teshuvos 494 footnote 60. He quotes the Mishneh Lamelech Issurei Mizbeach 7:3 in the name of the Be’er Sheva. The Mishneh Lamelach himself argues there but many others agree with the Be’er Sheva.)</p>\n<p>(15) Lekutei Chaver Ben Chaim brings another reason: that it’s a Zecher for Matan Torah (Tehillim 29:5) – “קול י-הו-ה שבר ארזים וישבר י-הו-ה את־ארזי הלבנון”.</p>\n<p>(16) Sha’ar Yissachar writes in the name of Rav Chaim Elazar from Munkatch that the reason is based on the Zohar (Emor 96a) “וביום (במדבר כ״ח:כ״ו) הבכורים בהקריבכם מנחה חדשה ליי' בשבועותיכם מקרא קדש יהיה לכם וגו'. רבי שמעון פתח, (דברי הימים א ט״ז:ל״ג) אז ירננו עצי היער מלפני יי' כי בא לשפוט את הארץ.”</p>\n<p>(17) The Chassam Sofer in Drashos says that אילן is Gematriah 91 which is Shem Havaya (26) plus Adon-ai (65). This includes not just those who learn Torah (and are like the trees that give fruit) but also those that support Torah and in the future they too will give fruit as the Passuk in Yechezkel (36:8) says “ואתם הרי ישראל ענפכם תתנו ופריכם תשאו לעמי ישראל כי קרבו לבוא” – “But you, O mountains of Israel, shall yield your produce and bear your fruit for My people Israel, for their return is near.” We learn out from this that in the future even the barren trees will give fruit.</p>\n<p>There is a story with the Chassam Sofer’s canopy made out of branches and the Gabbai who didn’t make it one year. In Chut Hameshulash it says that the Chassam Sofer got very angry at him and he didn’t live out the year. However, Tzenah Malei Sefarim says that Chas Veshalom that the Chassam Sofer would make someone die. Instead, his house burned down and the Chassam Sofer said “You took away my house, so Hashem took away yours, Hashem was שפך חמתו על עצים ואבנים.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The authenticity of rabbinic literature\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am studying the history of various branches of Judaism. I understand the position of rabbinic Judaism that parts of the laws were oral and not written. But this alone would not justify the authenticity of the current rabbinic literature as given by God. In other words, how can one know that what is stated in them is the same as what was given by God? So my question is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What are the arguments for the authenticity of rabbinic literature?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The Jews believe in the Written Torah as it was given word for word from God to Moses. But additionally, we believe that Moses was taught by God an Oral Torah, that is, a tradition of how to explain the text of the Written Torah, how certain laws are applied, how we practice certain <em>mitzvos</em>, and other additional concepts pertaining to Jewish law.</p>\n\n<p>Moses taught this oral tradition to the Jews and the leaders of the nation, and it was passed down generation to generation until it finally came time to write it down lest it be eventually forgotten or distorted, which resulted in the Mishna, and then later expounded upon in the Talmud. The Talmud as we know it is a collection of rulings and legal discussions with regard to not only biblical laws, but rabbinic laws as well. But when the Talmud discusses biblical law, it assumes the existence of the oral tradition. It tells of the laws as they are traditionally understood through the lens of the Oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p>There certainly is no lack of history when it comes to many Jews denying the existence of the Oral Torah. The Sadducee people come to mind, as well as Spinoza. But in general, the argument usually given for the authority of the Oral Torah is the obvious ambiguity of the laws of the Written Torah when taken at face value. Here are a couple classic examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One of the laws of the Torah is the daily donning of tefillin. But the Torah makes no mention to how this is done, to what tefillin are, to what goes inside them, nor to whom this applies (men, women, children?) Only the oral Torah addresses any of this.</li>\n<li>The Torah writes that one may not do work on Shabbos. But it never mentions what constitutes work. Only with the Oral Torah is it clearly defined how one transgresses Shabbos.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems pretty clear that some form of tradition must exist to observe these <em>mitzvos</em> that we would otherwise not have any idea what they are talking about.</p>\n\n<p>Another argument is simply that it was given to us by the previous generations along with the Written Torah. In other words, just as we believe the previous generation that this Written Torah they are showing us is divine, we believe their interpretation of it as well.</p>\n\n<p>A story illustrating this argument is related in the Talmud (Shabbos 31a):</p>\n\n<p>A non-jew who believed in the Written Torah wanted to convert. He went to the great rabbi Shamai and asked him, \"How many Torahs do you have?\". Shamai responded, \"Two. One written and one oral.\" The gentile said, \"I wish to convert to Judaism, but on the condition only to accept the written Torah.\" Shamai sent him away. Then the gentile went to Hillel and said again, \"I wish to convert to Judaism, but on the condition only to accept the written Torah.\" Hillel accepted him as a student for conversion. The first day Hillel taught him the Hebrew alphabet. When he came the next day, he reviewed the alphabet, but this time, Hillel switched the letters, that is, he referred to letter aleph as \"beit\", and beit as \"aleph\", etc. The non-jew protested, \"But yesterday you taught me differently!\" Hillel responded, \"You see? You rely on me for your understanding of even the simplest thing like the names of the letters.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hillel's point was that we have no idea what the Torah means without the way it was taught to us and explained to us by our Rabbis. This was his reasoning for the authenticity of the Oral Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Frankly, kaveh, we don't know it's 100% the same.  Traditional rabbinic literature is riddled with arguments about legal details.  But, that is part of traditional Judaism.  G-d expected unclarity in areas, that is why he gave us the laws of <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0517.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 17</a>- the Supreme Court on the Temple Mount.  This becomes the absolute law even if a greater scholar disagrees.  In fact, the rulings of the Supreme Court define the oral law (Rambam Mamrim 1:1) even if the court had no knowledge of precedent.  There is even a case in the Talmud where a heavenly sign proclaimed what the law was in the heavenly spheres.  The sages disregarded this sign based on the principle that the Law is not in heaven (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0530.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 30:12</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Disputes continue to this day concerning how to interpret earlier scholars and apply them to modern cases.  </p>\n\n<p>It certainly is not a free for all and there are rules about ruling, and there are disputes about these rules as well (Many disputes are concluded based on the Biblical principal of court majority.)</p>\n\n<p>That being said, it is interesting to note that there are few disagreements on major ideas.  There is a consensus about what constitutes prohibited work on the sabbath.  There are disputes about how to categorize them and how to apply them biblically vs rabbinically.  </p>\n\n<p>How do we know our parents gave us the correct tradition at all?  The same way you know your parents are your parents.  You don't know 100%, but you know they would not lie to you about this.  G-d did not write all laws in the bible, but instead commanded this generation to generation transmission as the vehicle for Judaic practice.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I am collecting the arguments that has been given in one answer.

What were communal prayer like in the times of beit hamikdash? It would seem from the gemara in Megilla 25b that there was some form of prayer going on whenever their ma'amad was up in the beit hamikdash, but rashi over there says that the town square does not get kedusha from this as it was not set/regular enough (seemingly, this was only done for two weeks a year and when there was no rain). It would seem odd if there was no daily communal prayer though as there was a beit keneset (though I suppose that could be for monday, thursday, shabbat, etc)</p>\n\n<p>2 . Was there prayer two or three times a day? (I would expect that Ma'ariv is a probably not, as that was accepted as a minhag later I think)</p>\n\n<p>3 . In a gemara in brachot (sorry I can't seem to find it), it would seem by juxtaposition that the korbanot and the daily prayers are related at least in their times. Did the three daily prayers come from the two daily korbanot and the trumat hadeshen?</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if we don't hold like the Rambam, and say that prayer is rabbinic, do we say that there was any kind of prayer other than when an individual felt like it in the times of the beit hamikdash?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: here I am using times of the beit hamikdash to refer to beit reshon, as in the times of biet sheni there was the shemoneh esri already. It would be interesting to find out the \"rollout\" as it were of the shmoneh esri and start of reading the torah on monday tuesday and thursday and how they came about, but that is for another question I think.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Before the anshei kneseth hagedolah created specific formulations for prayers and blessings, people recited it how they wanted. They would pray to G-d frequently, not just when it was their turn to ma'amdos. As for communal prayer, it may be they did not have set times to daven together. However, they did gather to hear the Torah on shabbath, and Ezra institutes that it also be read on Mondays and Thursdays. </p>\n\n<p>Before the churban bayis rishon, people did not necessarily pray 3 times a day. This was instituted after the destruction to correspond to the 2 Tamid korbanos (shacharit and mincha), and to the burning of the leftovers from the korbanos (hekter chalavim v'evarim). \nBecause this was not necessary if there were no leftovers, Ma'ariv does not have the same obligatory status as the other 2 prayers. </p>\n\n<p>(Although the gemara also mentions an opinion that the tefilloth also correspond to the Avoth, they still correspond to the korbanoth.)</p>\n\n\n",

The gentiles have the written Torah (ever since, under order of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, it was translated into Greek, and later into other languages); but so long as the Oral Torah remained orally transmitted, it was unavailable to them.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the idea that it is vital not only to study Torah, but to develop a personal relationship with a teacher. This is expressed in the phrase, \"Service of Torah is greater than its study\" (Talmud, Berachos 7b). Thus, another reason for keeping the Oral Torah oral is to make its mastery dependent on that kind of face-to-face learning.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are many answers given to this question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Midrash cited in the other answer refers to the exclusive relationship that the Oral Torah allowed.

When nothing else is written down, the entire focus of one's studies always remains on the Torah (or Pentateuch) itself. Students are able to constantly re-discover the sources for laws in the Torah itself.

I remember hearing it in yeshiva as a kid, but sadly I mostly forgot it and only know some vague details :( Is there anywhere I can read it? Where is it brought down exactly?

Gershon referenced one such version in print, which is translated below.</p>\n<p>As to the Shavuot connection, Akdamut is about the greatness of G-d and the heavenly spheres; it then goes into how the Jews were chosen and given the Torah (which is its triumphant concluding line). At the simplest level, it connects as it's about giving the Torah. Gershon's source cites others who point out that the Haftorah of Shavuot is Ezekiel's heavenly visions of chariots, thus Akdamut also spends a while on such imagery (occasionally using wordage from the Haftorah, translated into Aramaic.)</p>\n<p>There are other Shavuot connections given, but that's beyond the scope of this question.</p>\n<p>Here's the story as found in Gershon's link:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was once a place where Jews, the offspring of Moses, resided, beyond the Sambatyon river, in peace and tranquility; the local king was a good man and fair to them. But this was a place that valued witchcraft; and a heathen priest arose who, via his witchcraft, could glance at someone with the evil eye and kill them on the spot. This priest began killing many Jews such, and eventually the Jews complained to the king (without whose permission they were powerless to stop this menace). The priest craftily explained to the king that he sought a theological debate with the Jews, and that they must choose a champion to face him; such a Jewish champion would have to be great enough to withstand the sorcerer priest's evil eye. Should the Jew win, the sorcerer priest would be put to death; should the reverse happen, G-d forbid, the king would do away with the Jews. The king gave the Jews three months to select their champion, sending the Jews into deep woe and mourning as they lacked such an individual.</p>\n<p>Now the Sambatyon river would rest from noon on Fridays until dusk on Saturday, but it was a ten-mile width; anyone beginning crossing on Friday afternoon would not arrive till the Sabbath, thus <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruv_techumin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">violating the Sabbath by walking far beyond the city limits</a>. But Sabbath violation was needed to save this community; however, whoever would arrive there would not be allowed to return as there would be no more emergency dispensation. (Though the Talmud allows emergency responders to return home, this permits the 1-mile rabbinic limit, not the 10-mile Biblical limit). Such a champion, forced to live out his days on this side of the Sambatyon, would have to take a wife from the local, highly-pedigreed Jewish population, and thus must possess outstanding ancestry himself.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir the son of Isaac, the cantor and great scholar known to us as the author of Akdamut, was chosen; he had a wife and daughter, but faced with no other choice, he divorced his wife so she could have her own life as he would never return across the Sambatyon. Rabbi Meir began his journey on Friday afternoon and arrived on the Sabbath, whereupon he was immediately arrested for his violation. Rabbi Meir then produced his paperwork showing his credentials to rescue the local Jews from their dire straits, and was released.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[Translator's comment - I guess it had to be a local Jew who would be at the debate, but Rabbi Meir gave his wisdom or power to him? The story's unclear about this point.]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the debate was to take place on the other side of the Sambatyon; a lottery was conducted and the tailor was chosen to cross the Sambatyon, never to return. He divorced his wife and it was agreed that he should marry Rabbi Meir's daughter. Over the course of the week, the Divine spirit rested upon Rabbi Meir, and he composed the Akdamut liturgy; either it was shortly before Shavuot, or that was the liturgical occasion he was up to in his private study; he gave Akdamut to his son-in-law the tailor and asked that all Jewish communities say it on Shavuot, so that Rabbi Meir would not be forgotten.</p>\n<p>The tailor arrived at the debate and climbed onto the stage before the crowd; the sorcerer cast his evil eye upon him, but to no effect. The sorcerer then said to the king, \"some amusement before the debate, your Majesty\"; he took two nearby millstones and threw them into the sky, where they remained supsended, but revolving in place as if grinding wheat -- a wondrous sight.\n\"Can you match that?\", jeered the sorcerer. Fair enough, replied the tailor. \"See those trees over there? Either you will bend one down, and I will have to keep it down; or vice versa.\" The sorcerer chose that the tailor should choose a tree, bend its top parallel to the ground, and then let the sorcerer hold it in place. No sooner did the tailor let go than the sorcerer's strength was insufficient; up sprung the tree, flinging the sorcerer directly into the skyborne grindstones, meeting a pulverized and gruesome ending. The crowd cheered; the king looked up, and let the tailor (and all the Jews) go in peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Here is a link to a Sefer that mentions the story and answers your questions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31123&pgnum=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31123&pgnum=25</a></p>\n\n\n",

Yet what allows any work of Torah to be written nowadays? Not every work is preventing \"Torah from being forgotten from Israel\"!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is a discussion of this topic <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/391\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. The author there brings the gemara (Gittin 60a) regarding Chazal's exeptions to the rule of not writing down Torah Shebaal Peh and fragments of Torah Shebiksav based on \"עת לעשות לה' הפרו תורתך\", then the dispute between poskim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We see that in order to facilitate Torah learning, Chazal permitted the writing of the Oral Torah and parts of the books of the Written Torah. To what extent did they override the original prohibition?</p>\n<p>This is a dispute among early poskim, some contending that it is permitted to write only as much as is necessary to prevent Torah from being forgotten. According to this opinion, it is prohibited to write or print even tefillos that include pasukim that are not intended for learning Torah (Rif and Milchemes Hashem, Shabbos Chapter 16). This opinion also prohibits translating Tanach into any language other than the original Aramaic Targum because proper translations constitute Torah She’ba’al Peh. In addition, this opinion prohibits the printing of a parsha of Chumash in order to teach Torah, since one could write or print the entire sefer (Rambam, Hilchos Sefer Torah 7:14; Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 283:2). Other poskim permit the writing of any Torah that one uses to learn. Thus, they permit writing a single parsha in order to teach Torah (Taz 283:1; Shach 283:3) and the translating of Tanach into any language. These poskim rally support to their opinion from the fact that Rav Saadya Gaon wrote sefarim in Arabic, including commentaries on Tanach (Ran, Shabbos Chapter 16).</p>\n<p>Both opinions agree that it is prohibited to publish translations of Tanach that will not be used to spread Torah knowledge (Ran, Shabbos Chapter 16).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is popularly claimed that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Adler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Nattan Adler</a>, the mentor of the Hattam Soffer, was indeed of the opinion that the Oral Law may only be written to avoid it being forgotten, and he, who would remember it anyway, was not permitted to write it. (Cf. for example Yalkut Yossef: Pesukei D'zimra V'kriat Sh'ma; notes to chapter 49) This is also mentioned by the K'tav Sofer's son in Hut HaMeshulash (p. 19).</p>\n\n<p>One can certainly question how compelling this argument is, given that writing is a crucial way of conveying information to future generations, but regardless a very similar statement is actually made by his student <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sofer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hattam Soffer</a>, in a responsum to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ts'vi Hirsch Hajes</a> (Vol. I OH #280):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלבד שהוא עובר איסור דאורייתא דברים שבעל פה אי אתה רשאי לכותבן ולא הותר אלא משום עת לעשות לה' [כגיטין ס' ע\"א] ואם איננו עושה לה' הרי איסורו במקומו עומד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes that one who publishes a work with ulterior motives, violates the injunction against recording the Oral Law, which is only permitted for one with the intention of acting for the sake of God.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note, that while he does indeed indicates that the prohibition is still active, and is merely held in abeyance by appropriate exceptions, this statement is made in the somewhat flowery beginning of the responsum, and not as part of an involved halakhic discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is certainly a minority view. As many have noted (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Faur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hakham Faur</a> S\"t in Golden Doves With Silver Dots p. 102), Rambam omits this rule entirely from his halakhic writings, (referencing it only as a historical practice in Moreh Nevokhim I:71) indicating that it is no longer a concern, if it ever was.</p>\n\n<p>The mainstream approach in poskim is to assume as a matter of fact that the prohibition is totally obsolete today, (that is that 'et laasot' totally revoked the prohibition) and it is thus not generally invoked in halakhic works. Like Rambam, the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh, for example, only mention the issue of reciting the Written Law orally, but not the issue of writing the Oral Law. R. Yosef similarly concludes his aforementioned reference to R. Adler by noting that this is not the halakha.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly understandable if the whole prohibition is rabbinic as the Yereim (268) implies (noting that the prohibition to recite oral Torah is rabbinic, and the cited verse which is the source for both laws is a mere asmakhta. If it was the rabbis in the first place who forbade it, they have the licence to fully revoke it if they found it to have become counter-productive.</p>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that R. Qafih writes (Ketavim Vol II p. 546-7) that the prohibition of writing the Oral Law is still active, and therefore Rambam only recorded already recorded laws in the Mishneh Torah.[i] [ii] </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, an important corollary of R. Qafih's assertion, is that explicating already recorded oral law is not in violation of the injunction. Although one can question where the line is drawn between deriving information from already recorded texts, and recording hitherto unrecorded information, this perspective would likely render the issue moot, as unlike in the time of the Ammoraim when much ancient oral teachings were still promulgated, most modern literary activity focuses on explaining existing <em>texts</em>, rather than recording ancient otherwise unrecorded traditions. Even were there such traditions, it would likely be permissible to record them under the rubric of \"et laasot\". Thus, if it is permissible to record and explicate already recorded oral law, and it is permissible to record otherwise unrecorded traditions, then little is left forbidden.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] He noted that cases where Rambam says \"yireh li\" are still based off already recorded sources, but the sources are cryptic.</p>\n\n<p>[ii] While this is not the place to discuss this view in depth, it should be be noted that it seems difficult to maintain that everything in the Mishneh Torah is based on explicit written sources, rather that oral tradition, given for example Hilkhot Avodah Zara (12:6). Perhaps R. Qafih would answer that that tradition itself can be derived from existing sources, cf. Tashbets (2:100).</p>\n\n\n",

While standing there, Levi pulls up and directs Shimon to vacate the spot so that he can park there. </p>\n\n<p>Assuming that they live under the sovereignty of a non-Jewish government without any specific law on the matter, is Shimon obligated to step out of the spot so Levi can park there?</p>\n\n<p>What if there was a law forbidding people from standing in parking spots? Does Levi have any halachic basis to ask Shimon to leave?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is similar to the topic discussed <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/business-halacha/5757/vol1no29.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, we say <em>zachin l'adam shelo b'fanav</em>, that you may acquire something for someone else if it is for his own benefit (even without his knowledge), except when your acquisition is at a third party's expense. However, in the case of acquiring a lost object on another's behalf, the gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.10a.13-10b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 10a-10b</a>) rules that it may be done even though it is at the expense of all other potential finders of the object. Ramban and Tosafos differ, though, on the reason for the gemara's ruling. Tosafos say that since you have the ability to acquire the object for yourself, you may do so for your friend as well, even at the expense of another. Ramban says that since that third party in the case of the lost object is not any one specific person with particular rights to the object, he cannot prevent you from acqiring it for your friend.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when it comes to the parking space, Shimon is trying to acquire the space on Reuven's behalf and at the expense of Levi. According to Ramban, it seems this would definitely be okay, because Levi does not have any personal rights to the parking spot, and this is essentially the same case as the lost object. According to Tosafos, it's not as obvious. Can Shimon potentially acquire the space for himself without an actual car? Perhaps you can say that since Shimon can pay for the parking space himself and store his belongings there if he likes, so too he may save the spot for Reuven as well.</p>\n\n<p>If, though, there is a law prohibiting Shimon from standing in the parking spot, then first we would employ <em>dina d'malchusa</em> if it is an enforced civil law, and second, Shimon may no longer have a halachic basis according to Tosafos' opinion, since he cannot acquire the spot for himself without a car and without breaking the law.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, for practical rulings, <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CYLOR</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/754885/Rabbi_Hershel_Schachter/Snow_in_Halacha\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Herschel Schachter</a> was asked this question regarding saving a parking space which you yourself shoveled out (from snow).  He definitively said that one may not save the space.  This seemed to be related to the fact that it is illegal.</p>\n\n\n",

The liquid which comes out of the meat after the period of salting is not blood but is called mohul (juice). The Gemora refers to it as chamra boser (the wine of the meat). In other words, although it may have the appearance of blood, it is not in reality blood that is ossur at all.</p>\n  \n  <p>B. The issur of blood that comes out through the salting process is only forbidden Rabbinically, and the Rabbis limited their prohibition to blood that comes out of the meat during the period of salting . After that time, anything that comes out of the meat, although it may be blood, it is not within the Rabbinical enactment.

Taking the question at its face value, however, the OP just wants to know how well meat needs to be cooked in order to be Kosher.  As YDK's answer suggests (albeit somewhat vaguely), cooking has nothing to do with the Kashering process. Yes, we could get technical and discuss roasting meat in lieu of salting as a means of blood-removal, etc., but if the question is taken at face value, it is based on a faulty premise, probably due to a misunderstanding, that meat needs to be cooked 'X' amount in order to be Kosher.

Why do we repeat the Shemoneh Esrei out loud?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Yes, the original purpose was so that if someone doesn't know how to pray, they could hear the chazzan's repetition and fulfill their obligation that way.

Also, it requires the presence of a minyan (Mishnah Berurah 124:1). That second point means that it's hard to conceive of a case of \"pressing need\" where a person who knows how to pray would need to use the chazzan's repetition to fulfill his obligation - he'll have to be in shul anyway, and may as well recite Shemoneh Esrei himself.</p>\n\n<p>Even when everyone in shul knows how to pray, though, the Sages' enactment - of first reciting Shemoneh Esrei silently and then the chazzan repeating it out loud - still remains in effect, just in case it happens one time that an unlearned person shows up.

Mekitzei Nirdamim, nos. 35</a>-36) that the silent Shemoneh Esrei should be skipped, and they should just go straight to the chazzan's repetition. The reason was because people were talking or otherwise not paying attention during the repetition. There has been some discussion about the parameters of this ruling, though the consensus seems to be that it was only for that particular time and place (see the teshuvah of R' Ovadiah Yosef <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/toshba/shut/7.htm\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

Eventually, due to the fear of forgetting the Torah, it became permitted to write it down, and many seforim have been written since the 9th century CE. Where does participation in Torah websites (such as this one) fit into this picture? Does it go further than the original hetter by writing and publishing so much material from any person? Or perhaps it fits more with the nature of Oral learning because of its discussion nature? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have no sources and the following is mere speculation:</p>\n\n<p>Even before the heter to write Oral Torah was enacted, people certainly had notes written down for their own personal study. (See Rambam, intro. to Mishna Torah.) And one can only assume that <em>sh'ailos</em> and <em>t'shuvos</em> were written back and forth between communities that contained rulings and explanations of the Oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the difference between those writings and the writings that were prohibited before the heter? I would say the difference is that the notes and <em>t'shuvos</em> were written and kept with the intention of personal reference and study and not for public consumption. We do not find that books of <em>sh'ailos ut'shuvos</em> were written and published, since these were considered private texts, to be viewed by the intended recipients.</p>\n\n<p>The books we have today, on the other hand, are texts that are written and published with the <em>intention</em> of being read by a public audience. They are permitted to write so that Torah not be forgotten, or even just for the purpose providing texts from which one may study Torah. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7894/why-can-people-write-torah-shebal-peh-nowadays/7898#7898\">here</a>.) Even the published <em>sh'ailos ut'shuvos</em> are intended for public use and study, which makes them part of the now-written Oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Now, where do this and similar websites fit into this picture? If this was strictly a question-answer site for personal rulings and explanations of Torah ideas directed for personal use by the asker, it would probably not even be a utilization of chazal's original heter. It would just be a modernized version of the old <em>sh'aila</em>- <em>t'shuva</em> method. However, since all answers are online for public viewing, and not only that, but intended to be a method of Torah learning for others interested in the topics addressed here, it would seem to be at the same level as all the other contemporary published Torah books. Even more so the non-Q&A oriented sites, like those that simply publish Torah content online.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can see to go \"further than the original heter\" is to publish material that contains Oral Torah, but is not particularly intended for Torah study and reference. This site would certainly not fall under that category.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7870/why-was-torah-shebal-peh-not-allowed-to-be-written\">Why was Torah SheBe'Al Peh not allowed to be written?</a> for some of the reasons why Torah sheB'al Peh wasn't supposed to be written. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Exclusivity - Online is even worse than in books, as its open to everyone. But perhaps we are no longer worried about this issue? </li>\n<li>Flexibility - The original texts (e.g. the Mishnah) imposed a certain structure that gave up on something (but was still necessary).

Shouldn't \"Parve\" milk substitutes be considered milchig/halavi for the same reason?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I'd like to propose a different way of looking at the possibility of confusion between chicken and meat. </p>\n\n<p>Most people explain the problem is that the Rabbis decreed that chicken can have a Halachic status of meat, since it is similar in appearance and may be confused with meat. If so, why wouldn't such a decree apply to all things that may be mistaken for something else. As was asked in the question, should soy milk also be considered like real milk?</p>\n\n<p>However, if you explain that the Rabbis were worried about confusion resulting from a logical mistake (and not a mistake in appearance), you could understand why chicken is Rabbinacally considered like real meat while soy milk is not considered like real milk.</p>\n\n<p>To explain. Just like meat, kosher birds have a biblical obligation to be ritually slaughtered and salted. Just like meat, if one of these steps is not done properly, the bird is unfit/forbidden to eat. However, there is no Biblical problem with eating kosher birds with milk.</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbis saw that people were making a logical error and saying, \"If a bird that must be slaughtered and salted may be eaten with milk, the same thing should also apply to a kosher animal that must be slaughtered and salted. The animal should also be permitted to be eaten with milk.\"</p>\n\n<p>Once the Rabbis saw the logical mistake people were making, they banned the practice of eating fowl with milk, so that people would not mistakenly eat animal meat with milk.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a source for this, but the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&pgnum=357\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz in Yorah Deah 81:6 S\"K 9</a> uses similar logic to explain why it is forbidden for an adult to drink breast-milk directly from the source. The Taz explains that the reason it is forbidden is because \"you may come to switch it with an impure animal\", which I understand to mean that you may make a logical mistake that if milk from a person (who is impure - i.e. may not be eaten) may be consumed, I might come to conclude that milk from a nonkosher animal may also be consumed.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I just saw the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1181853\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchot Mamrim 2:9</a>, where the Rambam explains the decree forbidding chicken and meat was to prevent a logical mistake. He has a different logical mistake people could make. He says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the court says: <strong>\"The meat of fowl cooked in milk is permitted according to Scriptural Law. We, however, are prohibiting it and publicizing the prohibition as a decree, lest the matter lead to a detriment and people say: 'Eating the meat of fowl cooked in milk is permitted, because it is not explicitly forbidden by the Torah. Similarly, the meat of a wild animal cooked in milk is permitted, because it is also not explicitly forbidden.'</strong> \"And another may come and say: 'Even the meat of a domesticated animal cooked in milk is permitted with the exception of a goat.' And another will come and say: 'Even the meat of a goat is permitted when cooked in the milk of a cow or a sheep. For the verse mentions only \"its mother,\" i.e., an animal from the same species.' And still another will come and say: 'Even the meat of a goat is permitted when cooked in goat's milk as long the milk is not from the kid's mother, for the verse says: \"its mother.\"' For these reasons, we will forbid all meat cooked in milk, even meat from fowl.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>From what I remember, the rabbinic inclusion of chicken with meat is not because of Maris Ayin (people will think you are doing the wrong thing) but because of confusion in the law.  Having a chicken on the table to show you are eating chicken won't help.  They know it came from the chicken, but they will mistakenly assume that just as chicken can be eaten with milk, so can meat since it's biologically the same- only the Torah makes a distinction.</p>\n\n<p>No one thinks soy or almond milk is the same as cow or goat milk, so they won't mistakenly extend your case to real milk.  However, someone who sees you and thinks you are drinking milk may assume that you are doing the wrong thing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>For those who want a sourced response check out this great article: <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/this_week/insights_into_halacha/5080\" rel=\"noreferrer\">margarine misconceptions and maris ayin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basically we follow the Kreisi Upleisi's exception that once something becomes common it lessens the prohibition of maris ayin. Nowadays no one would think twice about \"buttering\" your bread with margarine etc.; the same would apply with soy milk.  Some might say its preferred to leave the container on the table, but it would not be meakev.</p>\n\n\n",

So one would translate \"<strong>b'</strong>-shabbos\" as \"of Shabbos\" and \"<strong>ba</strong>-shabbos\" as \"of <em>the</em> Shabbos\".</p>\n\n<p>That said, it would depend on what the intention is of the phrase \"היום יום <strong>__</strong> בשבת\". </p>\n\n<p>Simply speaking, one could say that \"שבת\" in this context means \"week\". Indeed, the Metsudah siddur translates, \"Today is the <em>_</em>_ day of the week.\" In this case, we need the \"ה\" prefix for \"<strong><em>the</em></strong> week\", so the word becomes \"<strong>ba</strong>-shabbos\".</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I found a Breslov siddur in my house that has a commentary with (typically) kabbalistic tendencies. In it, it quotes from Likutei Moharan (2:2) that everyday one should mention the Shabbos thereby extending its holiness through the entire week, and each day will have its own aspect of holiness, which is why we have a particular <em>mizmor</em> for each day.</p>\n\n<p>According to this, it would seem that the phrase \n\"היום יום __ בשבת\" \nreally means \"Today is the <strong>__</strong> day of [the extended holiness of] Shabbos\", in which case there is no need for the \"ה\" prefix, and the word will be \"<strong>b'</strong>-shabbos\".

There it was the prayer of Rav that he added after completing his daily prayers. As quoted there, <em>Yiras Shomayim</em> is only found at the end and not together with <em>Yiras Chet</em>.

I don't know of any distinction between Jewish and not.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another issue that would apply at all times is stray thoughts about women.  Again, I don't know if it makes a difference if the \"thinker\" is Jewish.  I was once involved with a group who were going for advanced swimming lessons, using a separate part of the pool and where thoughts were less of a problem because of the age of the other females in the pool.  I was told that I did not have to protest.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although you may be thinking at this point that this seems doable, I must bring a 3rd point:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Based on the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14398&st=&pgnum=106\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch EhE 21</a>, those who are careful about mitzvos avoid mixed social events, especially where the sole purpose of the event is to have a good time together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There's no consensus among the poskim as to what is the basis of the mixed swimming issur, so it's really hard to answer your question. However, two main issues that consistently come up are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The women at the beach or pool are not modestly dressed.</li>\n<li>The act of a woman bathing in an area designated for men is seen as a promiscuous act (See gittin 90b).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now the first issue one can easily avoid if one is careful to swim in a large body of water where women aren't close by (or seen from the distance). Or in the instance of the OP, where the woman is modestly dressed and swimming with a non-Jewish male (Even if the woman would not be modestly dressed, there would be no issue for her to cause the non-Jewish male to have impure thoughts). However, the second issue would be harder to get around. The reason why she would not be allowed to swim with the non-Jewish male in the pool in this instance is because some would consider it as if the woman is bathing in an area designated for men.</p>\n<p>However, there are a lot of holes in this argument. Firstly, since the swimming pool is not designated specifically for men, it is hard to see how this could be considered a promiscuous act. In the gemara gittin cited above the women is bathing in a bathhouse designated for men (which are by the way nude), or bathing with them, so it is easy to see why this act would be considered promiscuous; but in our case the pool is not designated for men but is a public area, the fact that a woman and man are swimming in the same pool each going their own way would not raise any red flags, and would not be seen as an overly promiscuous act (especially since both the men and women are not completely nude). Nowadays, it is accepted practice that women and men go to the beach and swim together, modern society does not consider this indecent behavior for any of the sexes. Especially since separate beaches are not always available, the fact that a man chooses to swim in a public area where other women are around, or vice versa, should not be seen as a promiscuous act. Secondly, in the gemara the woman is clearly trying to be provocative by walking into a men's bathhouse, this does not apply to a woman walking into a public swimming pool trying to enjoy herself without the intention of arousing other men. This issue is actually raised in Asher chunan (6-7, siman 108), although the author merely concludes that the husband would not be able to divorce her on the ground of her going to the beach, it does illustrate why comparing one swimming at the beach to a woman bathing in a men's bathhouse is highly contentious. See also yechaveh daas 5:63, the author clearly writes that this is assur.</p>\n<p>In any case, this discussion only holds in the case where the women is immodestly dressed; if the woman would be modestly dressed as in the OP's case, even this would not be an issue (issue no. 2 is clearly only a problem when the women is somewhat immodestly dressed, there is no issue with bathing in the same area as men, per se), and the Jewish woman may swim freely in a pool where there is another male around, Jewish or non-Jewish, or even a mixed beach provided that she is modestly dressed. I have also verified this with a local Rav (strictly from a halachic perspective, however one should refrain from doing so if their minhag is not to).</p>\n<p>Now of course, for a male to swim in a public crowded beach would be prohibited for reason no. 1, since it's not possible for a man to guard his eyes in such a place. But if the male were to swim in a public beach far away from other people, it is hard to make the case that such an act is indeed prohibited, or that it is considered as if he's bathing together with women, or that such an act is provocative or inherently indecent. So to answer your question, yes it does make a difference whether the body of water is large or small.</p>\n<p>Even if one were to insist that swimming in a mixed pool is prohibited (regardless of dress code or that the area is not specifically designated for a specific gender), I think most would agree that if the beach is relatively empty, and the man and woman swimming are quite far from each other that we would not consider this as if they're bathing together in any way (or in the same area), thus such an act would clearly be permitted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It is incorrect (and according to some poskim assur) for her to go to a mixed swimming pool even when she is fully dressed. The poskim say that it is a lack of tznius for her to look at the men, and to be in such a place, there is also an issue of maris ayin for her to be in such a place.</p>\n<p>Source:\nHalichos Bas Yisroel 7-17</p>\n\n\n",

Edim 18:3)</a> notes that this rule is a <em>g'zeiras hakasuv</em> and gives no reason.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%98_%D7%99%D7%97\">Ramban (Devarim 19:18)</a>(as expounded upon by Ralbag and Abarbanel), the logic is as follows: When we have two pairs of witnesses in contradiction (i.e. \"Reuven did X\" vs. \"Reuven did not do X\") then we have no reason to believe one pair over another and may not take any form of action. However, here, Pair A of witnesses say \"Reuven did X\". The fact that they were present at a certain place at a certain time is not technically part of their testimony; it is just necessary background information. Thus, Pair B of witnesses, when they say that Pair A were in fact somewhere else at that time, they render Pair A's testimony impossible, and yet they have nobody technically contradicting them, since to do so there would need to be witnesses that Pair A were indeed at the relevant place at that time. (And Pair A themselves cannot testify concerning themselves.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42547&st=&pgnum=123\">Ran in his <em>d'rashos</em> (11)</a> gives another reason: We believe the witnesses who have less ability to lie. The first witnesses can set up a story and create false testimony and perhaps they were confident that nobody saw them elsewhere at the time they specify in their testimony. But if it is Pair B that is indeed lying, how are they not worried to testify falsely when Pair A knows that they are lying? All Pair A would have to do is bring other witnesses that they <em>know</em> were at the scene of the crime as well and saw them there. Thus, it is more likely that Pair A are the false witnesses since they have more \"ease\" in lying.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Their are different explanations given. Some give the technical reason that the zomemin are being testified against directly, while their testimony is on some other matter. The 2nd group's testimony falls directly on the 1st group, and they can't defend themselves from a an edus against them. (Compare this with regular contradicting testimonies, where both are rejected.) </p>\n\n<p>Another reason given is the ease of testimony, though its not as clear-cut. Its easier for the first group to lie, since they can plan what time they will say they saw something. On the other hand, the second group will have to mention the same time as the first group, which is more difficult to plan in advance. (If they're lying, other people may have seen them..)  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not all that knowledgeable on the subject, but I would assume that V'Darashta V'chakarta... also applies to the second pair of witnesses. After all, it's impossible to know right off the bat that the second pair is not trying to lie to help a friend of there.</p>\n\n\n",

I didn't know that it was called Jewish mysticism but nonetheless I was attracted to its beliefs with the books and symbols I have been acquainted with from some folks who, I believe, were deeply associated with it. </p>\n\n<p>Please tell me, how and where should I start? Am I even allowed to study it? If I am, am I allowed to pursue this knowledge on my own do I have to to have a \"guide\" with me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The proper way to study Kabbalah is with prior knowledge of Tanach, Talmud, Yad HaChazaka, and Shulchan Aruch (not including the introduction books to Kabbalah- some of the Ben Ish Hai's books, some of the Ramak, a lot of Rav Ashlag, and Rav Frisch). Without a massive knowledge of the aforementioned, Kabbalah won't do you any good, quite the contrary it can confuse your belief system. For example if someone doesn't know that the Eser Sefirot are not divisions of Qudsha Berich Hu, rather something else (which seems too deep for this site), they may actually be going against the core beliefs of Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem is, you must have a teacher to teach you, and not a scam artist.(BN) I teach someone on Sundays. You may be able to find a Kabbalist to teach you on the weekends. Then there is an issue with age- according to mainstream ashkenazic Judaism (and some Sephardic) you must 40 years old to learn Kabbala (Shach Y\"D 246:6. Or Lesion Musar, Torah ch. 7). Here are some tips to start learning on a low budget(so far)! (in order):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Go to Chabad.org and learn Tanach with in English with Rashi 2/3 chapters a day, you will finish in a few years.</li>\n<li>Go to Chabad.org and start learning the Rambam's Mishne Torah. If you do 1 chapter a day, you will finish in about 3 years. If you do 3 chapters a day you will finish in 1 year. Whichever way you like.</li>\n<li>Go to dailygemara.com or dafyomi.org or some dafyomi site and start learning a little Talmud.</li>\n<li>By now, you will have a solid foundation, to start learning Halacha BeIyun and Gemara BeIyun. If you can read Hebrew, at Hebrewbooks.org you will find an entire set of Mishna Berura, and other poskim. If you are ashkenaz, I highly recommend Mishna Berura (they also have in English), and if you Sephardic I highly recommend Yalkut Yosef (they already have more than 15 volumes in English). Then you will learn 2/3 simanim in each if day for a few years and eventually you will be a Halachic expert.</li>\n<li>Next, you must read the Shulhan Aruch HaAri discussing the Halachot and Minhagim of the Ari. You can finish that book in a few months. </li>\n<li>Now You can start to learn the INTRODUCTORY books of Rav Ashlag, Ben Ish Hai, Rav Yaakov Hilel, Rav Frisch etc. You must become and expert in the concepts of the Kabbalah before starting to learn. </li>\n<li>After hard work, you have arrived at the point where you purchase the Kitve HaAri (the Rashash warned against other Kabbalists books, you may only learn Kabbalah from here and the Zohar according the Rashash) and the Zohar with Or HaYakar. Now you are able to start learning Kabbalah with a teacher, and with all your prior knowledge from the other books I listed you will know who is real and who is fake.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>IN SUMMARY: After about 7-13 years of in-depth study of Judaism etc. you can begin your journey to Kabbalah.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also, you must keep in mind the 10 do and 10 don't do at the beginning in Es Haim (5b I believe).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Strongly recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_tc_2_0?rh=i%3astripbooks,k%3aAryeh%20Kaplan&keywords=Aryeh%20Kaplan&ie=UTF8&qid=1307124552&sr=8-2-ent&field-contributor_id=B001JX0XDG\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's books</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It is hard to tell what you mean by \"the core teachings of mysticism\".</p>\n\n<p>There is a part of Jewish tradition called \"kabbala\", but it is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1883/minimum-age-to-learn-kabbalah\">mostly reserved to be learned by people who have previous experience with other parts of Judaism</a>, primarily Jewish Law.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to pursue more knowledge in the teachings of Judaism, and are not interested in the intricate logical structure that is gemara and halacha, I would recommend looking into the Midrashic literature, since therein lies some of the greatest ethical teachings of Jewish tradition, as well as the inspiration for much of later Jewish mysticism. If you prefer your literature in English, I have no better recommendation than to study the Chumash with the accompaniment of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=aps&field-keywords=the%20midrash%20says&x=0&y=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Midrash Says\", by R' Moshe Weissman</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

But that would still be closer to B'Ezrat Hashem than to Boruch Hashem, since you would be saying \"By the Grace of G-d\" means \"with G-d's Blessing\", as opposed to Boruch Hashem, which means \"bless G-d\". </p>\n\n<p>It makes more straightforward to translate Grace in this context as <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grace\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"favor, or good will\"</a>, than to translate it as \"blessing\"]</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besiyata_Dishmaya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, <em>The book \"Toldot Yitzhak\" (‘The Offspring of Isaac’), by Yitzhak Karo, Yosef Karo's uncle, offers the meaning of this custom of writing ב\"ה (B\"H), at the top of every letter, with accordance to the biblical verse: \"In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths\" (Book of Proverbs 3:6)</em></p>\n\n<p>This seems to be a proof that ב\"ה stands for Boruch Hashem, since we acknowledge G-d by thanking him, but I could argue that recognizing that everything comes with G-d's help is also acknowledging Him.</p>\n\n<p>Also, R' Yitzchok Karo may very well be saying that ב\"ה stands for בשם ה׳. See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35813&pgnum=176\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and Alex's note below. Also, Alex points out <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7137/bsiyata-dshmaya-or-baruch-hashem/7143#7143\">here</a> that the Rambam would also start sections of his works with בשם ה' א-ל עולם </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update:</p>\n\n<p>I recently came across a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15833&pgnum=316\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">letter from the Lubavitcher Rebbe to the Rogatchover Gaon</a>, that may be addressing this issue.</p>\n\n<p>In the letter, Rebbe is asking for a source for putting ב\"ה and בעז\"ה in a letter, especially since it seems that the Gemara may indicate the opposite. However, it is unclear to me if the Rebbe is asking about putting it in the body of the letter or at the top of the letter.</p>\n\n<p>So it is possible that the Rebbe was looking for a source for this as well. Also the Rebbe writes ב\"ה and בעז\"ה separately, so this might be a proof that ב\"ה actually stands for Boruch Hashem.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>BS\"D (or בס״ד) stands for <b>B</b>'<b>s</b>ayata <b>d</b>'shmaya, which translates to \"with the help of heaven.\"</p>\n\n<p>B\"H (or ב״ה) used in the same context at the top of the page stands for <b>B</b>'ezrat <b>H</b>ashem, which translates to \"with God's help.\"</p>\n\n<p>בס״ד is the Aramaic version, ב״ה is the hebrew version, and they mean exactly the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>It may be that in other contexts, ב״ה means baruch hashem, but at the top of a page it means b'ezrat hashem. </p>\n\n\n",

The reason for this is that there's a concept in קדשים of \"כיון שנדחה ידחה\" (once something is נדחה, 'pushed away' from being allowed on the altar, it's forever נדחה and can never be allowed on the altar). Saying <em>Tziyon</em> is forever 'pushed away' is both false and seemingly in denial of the coming of the third <em>bes hamikdash</em>, and my grandfather, apparently, or whomever he got this practice from, didn't want to even seem to imply it.</p>\n\n<p>My question is whether this is a documented or known practice or version. (Not necessarily replacing הנדחה with הנשברה specifically, but with anything.) Where could my grandfather have gotten it from? A second question is whether anyone comments on the inappropriateness of the line in light of \"כיון שנדחה ידחה\".‎</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Artscroll זמירות לשבת (with sources) page 185:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהוּא יִדְרֹשׁ לְצִיּוֹן עִיר\n  הַנִּדָּחָה - May He seek out Zion the\n  outcast city.</p>\n  \n  <p>The phrase is based on <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t1130.htm\">Jeremiah\n  30:17</a> where Jerusalem - Zion - is\n  called <em>outcast</em> because no one cares\n  about her.

This I gather would make it difficult to call the verse inappropriate.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I had assumed that this objection was due to not wanting to call Yerushalayim an Ir Hanidachas; or else just describing Yerushalayim in negative terms. I daven in a shteibel in Kew Gardens Hills, Rabbi Freidman's shul (the Ulemer Rebbe, affiliated with Spinka), and the sefer they use for shalashudes has עיר המשובחה, ir hameshubacha, in its place. And this is supposed to reflect their nusach. Bli neder, I'll try to check the author, etc., next time I'm there.</p>\n\n<p>I personally don't think the line is inappropriate as it stands and as was presumably initially penned. One can raise all sorts of objections, but that does not make them solid objections. We say in davening <em>mekabeitz nidchei amo yisrael</em>, and this is no objection. That said, I haven't seen in print anyone commenting on the inappropriateness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: The other day, I checked out the sefer (put out by the rabbi's son). They had Baruch kel elyon twice, once for Shabbos day and once for shaleshudes. And in the first, they had ir hanidacha while in the second, they had ir hameshubacha. After maariv, I asked the rabbi about it. He told me that it was not the Spinker nusach, but one that he had seen around, and that perhaps the printers had put it in (in the second instance). He regarded it as a modern innovation, which he would never say; and thought that perhaps it was a <em>Zionist</em> innovation. So, I suppose, back to the drawing board, as to the reason. The variant nusach does exist in printed works; that much, we can establish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>BS\"D\nThere is a nussach of עיר המשובחה that I actually grew up with from my father z\"l who received it from his grandfather.\nI searched for many years to find the source and came upon the Gemara Bava Kama 82b where it says that Yerushalayim cannot be a  עיר הנדחת . See also Rambam hilchos avoda zara 4:4 (which I became aware of recently)\nYears later I found a zemiros that confirmed my assumption and attributed this nussach to Rebbe Meier of Premishlan.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that since, hypothetically, if one would find a <em>shidduch</em> in Israel, a source of income, he would be willing to settle there, he is no longer considered 'tied down' to chutz la'aretz. Even if his parents would object, he argues that a child does not need to heed his parents when it comes to a <em>shidduch</em>. </p>\n\n<p>There's a popular story that generally accompanies this <em>pesak din</em>: a young man once came to Hacham Ovadia and told him that he isn't ready to marry, and therefore should keep two days. Hacham Ovadia asked him, \"What if you found the <strong>perfect</strong> girl, who was willing to marry you today? Wouldn't you marry her?\" The boy asserted that he would not. He asked him, \"What if I offer you my granddaughter? wouldn't you marry her??\" Again, the boy asserted that he would not. Hacham Ovadia concluded, \"in that case you're completely <em>patur</em> from all mizvot: you're a <em>shoteh gamur</em>!\"  </p>\n\n<p>Many Sepharadic students who study in Israel after High School (who the footnote is actually addressed to) rely on this <em>pesak din</em> (but of course CYLOR).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Again, according to Rabbi Yaakov Emden, you keep 1 day if you're in Israel right now, no matter where you come from or where you intend to be. If you follow his opinion, this question is moot. The prevalence of this opinion has had a resurgence in recent years, especially as we all move around so much, no one really is \"of\" a specific place like they used to be. (Also, 300 years ago, you'd maybe have a small handful of non-Israelis visiting for yomtov. Today it's a giant industry; as Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach said, <em>the walls of Jerusalem cry every time the non-Israelis make a second-day yomtov minyan here.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>But assuming we follow the somewhat more mainstream approach, that a non-Israeli keeps 2 days; ask a rabbi. But often the criterion is either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Regularity with regards to yomtov: someone who has a house and job in America, but has gone to Israel for every yomtov for some time now.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sincerity and commitment with regards to the move to Israel, generally by putting your money where your mouth is. Someone who just moved to Israel a few weeks ago, but has sold his American house, quit his American job, and moved his whole family to Israel and started a new job in Israel, new house, new bank account, new everything; Rabbi Moshe Feinstein allowed such a person to keep 1 day (and when visiting American relatives, attend their 2nd Passover seder only so as not to cause a scene).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The flipside is the sincere yeshiva boy who swears on a Bible (not literally) that he's never leaving Israel -- but keeps calling his parents in Cedarhurst for money, and if they put their foot down, he'd have to go home. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein told a young R' Asher Zelig Rubinstein that he should have kept 2 days in this case.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"http://www.ravkooktorah.org/PESACH59.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this moving story</a> which I find very relevant to your question.</p>\n\n<p>The story is told by a holocaust survivor who came to deeply regret not heeding to Rav Kook's begging of him to make <em>Aliyah</em> in the 20's. </p>\n\n<p>The story suggests that the Halachic criterion for a Ben Eretz Yisrael is only the wholehearted decision to live in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>As has been pointed out in the comments a story (even by the great <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simchah Raz</a>) is not a viable Halachic source. It is however something to start with to seek out the source for this opinion.</p>\n\n<p>My assumption is that even those who hold this opinion would require a person who has made the decision to make <em>Aliyah</em> to actually be in Israel for the <em>chag</em>, but maybe not.</p>\n\n\n",

Colel Chabad is a 501(c)3 tax exempt organization.</p>\n  \n  <p>Colel Chabad's sole purpose has always been to help the most destitute residents of Israel in a manner that preserves and enhances their dignity.

All I do is put in how much money I want to send and 4 days later the check arrives at it's destination. This way I can send Tzedakah to any organization I want without leaving my chair or writing and delivering a check. This works great when paying for pledges given when getting an Aliyah. I am sure most other banks' online services lets you do the same thing.

According to Jewish law, this is cheese that is aged for six months or so. However, since modern manufacturing techniques enable cheese-makers to develop hard cheese in less time, contemporary halachic authorities do not agree on the matter. The halachic authorities of the OU Kashrut Department have ruled that cheese that is endowed with a unique texture or lingering taste—akin to the texture or taste classically acquired via aging—qualifies as hard cheese, regardless of the precise aging period. [...]\n\nMany posekim are of the opinion that one need not wait after eating cheese that is melted since melting compromises the texture and flavor of the cheese. Thus, there is no need to wait after American cheese, as it is a blend of cheddar cheese and additives that has been melted and re-formed. This is the OU's position as well.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The issue of <a href=\"http://www.thehalacha.com/attach/Volume6/Shavuos_Issue_Hard_Cheese.pdf\">Halachically Speaking: Waiting Between Hard (Aged) Cheese and Meat</a>, discusses which cheeses are considered hard and which ones aren't. (starting on page 5) </p>\n\n<p>It also brings a minority opinion that Hard cheese that has been melted into food is no longer considered hard cheese and one need not wait 6 hours after eating it.

(וכן הוא בזוהר). ויש מקילין. ואין\n  .למחות, רק שיעשו קנוח והדחה ונטילת ידים. מיהו טוב להחמיר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But he bases it (at least partially, but not the <em>chicken</em> part) on the Mordechai who quotes this teshuva from Mara\"m Mirottenberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שו\"ת מהר\"ם מרוטנבורג חלק ד (דפוס פראג) סימן תרטו</p>\n  \n  <p>וששאל אדוני ששמעת דאני נוהג שלא לאכול בשר בהמה וחיה אחר גבינה ומיקל\n  בבשר עוף.   בימי חורפי הייתי מתלוצץ בבני אדם שהיו עושי' כן ואדרבא שרא\n  לי מורי היה נראה בעיני כמו מינות עד שפעם אחת מסעודה לסעודה מצאתי גבינה\n  בין שיני [גזרתי] להחמיר [על] עצמי בבשר אחר גבינה כמו גבינה אחר בשר\n  ואין בדבר זה כחולק על התלמוד ולא כמוסיף שהוא גורע בפ' כל הבשר (ק\"ה\n  ע\"א) אנא להא מלתא כחלא בר חמרא דאלו אבא כדהוי אכל בישרא האידנא לא הוי\n  אכיל גבינתא עד למחר כו' דכל חד מצי לאחמורי אנפשי' לעשות משמרת ובבשר\n  עוף אני מיקל כיון דבשר עוף וגבינה נאכלי' באפקורן (שם ק\"ד ע\"ב) ושלום\n  מאיר ב\"ר ברוך זלה\"ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>who says that he started waiting because he himself found cheese between his teeth after an amount of time. Presumably, anything that will likely get stuck between your teeth should be considered <em>hard</em>, and anything that would is unlikely to get stuck is not considered <em>hard</em>. It should have nothing to do with whether or not it has a sharp taste to it. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ten plagues of Egypt: hail and pestilence\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Moses, the fifth plague of Egypt killed all livestock except that of Israel. If all were killed, then why did Moses warn the Pharaoh to bring his cattle to shelter before the hail? The text states that many animals were killed as they did not bring them in. I don't understand this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Your question really comes earlier, for in the plague immediately after the pestilence, we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִי, שְׁחִין אֲבַעְבֻּעֹת, פֹּרֵחַ, בָּאָדָם וּבַבְּהֵמָה</p>\n<p>\"and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which implies that the Egyptians had animals on which boils \"broke forth\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14386&st=&pgnum=74&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a>, in his description of the pestilence (דבר), writes that part of the greatness of this plague was that the Jews in Egypt were able to profit from it. The Jews had an abundance of livestock (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0147.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">they lived in Goshen for this reason</a>), and were able to sell animals to the Egyptians after the plague for exorbitant prices.</p>\n<p>It seems, according to this theory, that the Egyptians did indeed have animals that were to be afflicted with boils in the subsequent plague and then killed if left outside during the plague of hail (<em>barad</em>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9870/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 9:3</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>behold, the hand of the Lord will be upon your livestock <strong>that is in the field</strong>, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the cattle, and upon the sheep, a very severe pestilence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This limits the scope of the plague to the animals in the field. Hence, any animal brought inside was not afflicted. So when Verse 9:6 says \"all the livestock of the Egyptians died\", it is referring to all the livestock that were in the scope of the plague, every one of the animals in the fields died. (<a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/s02r.html#fn177\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi to 9:10 based on the Mechilta</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Then the plague of boils, which was non-lethal, \"attacked\" every Egyptian person and animal, regardless of whether they were inside or not. (Exodus 9:10)</p>\n\n<p>Then came the plague of hail, and Moshe warned the Egyptians that any animal or man left outside would get killed by the hail (Exodus 9:18-19), but any animal or man brought inside will be safe. Verse 20-21 tell us that the \"G-d fearing\" Egyptians brought their servants and animals inside, but the rest of the Egyptians did not. Verse 25 then tells us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The hail struck throughout the entire land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail struck all the vegetation of the field, and it broke all the trees of the field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once again only the animals in the field were struck, animals that were inside were unharmed by the plague. </p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, this answers something else. In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9875\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 14:6-7</a>, it says that Pharaoh harnessed his chariot, and took 600 chariots with him. Where did those horses come from? Weren't all the animals killed in the plagues. The animals came from the \"G-d fearing\" Egyptians, who brought their animals inside for the plagues. (<a href=\"http://www.tachash.org/metsudah/s04r.html#fn59\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi 14:7</a>) (Which is why I put \"G-d fearing\" in quotations. They may have been scared of G-d's plagues, but as soon as they saw that their free labor had left, they gladly offered their horses to try and get the Jews back).</p>\n\n\n",

The Even Shoshan dictionary (published in 1964, no link since I can't find it on the internet) has the word קרפדה and defines it as a toad (and has no entry for קרפדאי or any other similar word). Interestingly, it doesn't mark it as a foreign word. I assume the dictionary (or whatever source the dictionary might have used) assumed that קרפדה was a native word because of the word קרפדאי (\"mole\"), but <em>defined it as a toad because of the French word</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In short: קרפדה is not from the French \"crapaud,\" but from the Aramaic (or Persian?) קרפדאי, possibly related to Hebrew קיפוד, meaning \"mole\" (or \"porcupine\"). The meaning \"toad\" was probably assumed as the meaning of the word, based on French \"crapaud,\" sometime between 1959-1964. However, it's not a borrowing, but a conflation of meaning with an existing word.</p>\n\n\n",

And they went to Yerushalayim for the chagim, of course.  My question is: what did they do the rest of the time?  They didn't own land, so I presume they lived in the Levitical cities.  Doing what?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The kohanim were divided into 24 mishmarim, and each mishmar was divided into batei av. So (aside from holidays when all of the kohanim worked), kohanim worked in the beit hamikdash only 2 days a year.</p>\n\n<p>The answer that I heard (and I forget who said it, probably the Chofetz Chaim) was that a single day working in the beit hamkidash took 6 months of preparation. The kohanim were supposed to be free to be torah scholars, and that's why they're supported by terumah.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there were kohanim who were amei ha'aretz. Since their knowledge of Torah doesn't reflect spending 6 months of study between visits to the beit hamikdash, they must have spent their time running businesses or something like that. (And it should be noted, that the gemara strongly recommeded against giving one's terumah to kohanim who were amei ha'aretz.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Kohanim were supposed to be religious leaders. They studied Torah and taught and judged the people.

The question is: do you start this Kaddish in Aramaic since the rest of the Kaddish appears to be Aramaic or are you supposed to start Kaddish in Hebrew? Some medakdekim say that you could say Yisgadal v’Yiskadash even in Aramaic and some say you could Yisgadeil v’Yiskadeish in Hebrew.  I want to tell you a story that happened with the Rosh Yeshiva here, Rav Ruderman zecher tzaddik l’vracha, when he had yahrzeit. In his last years b’sof yamav, he did not daven from the amud when he had yahrzeit. He used to make Rav Moshe Mintz zol zein gezunt a shliach to daven for whatever reason. When Rav Ruderman was younger, he did daven from the amud and after davening Mincha Chazaras hashatz he said Yisgadeil v’Yiskadeish, which was the minhag in most Litvishe Yeshivos, but then after Aleinu he said Yisgadal v’Yiskadash. I asked him which one is the right thing to say, and he said he was mesupak about it, which is why he said it in different ways in order to be yotzei either way. There is no real right or wrong way about this. I believe that most places say Yisgadal v’Yiskadash, and it seems that the minhag in Slobodka was to say Yisgadeil v’Yiskadeish. Whatever you do, you are yotzei the Kaddish.</p>\n<p>In the footnote he quotes the Mishna Berura (56:2) - הקדיש - נוסח הקדיש יתגדל ויתקדש שהוסד ע\"פ המקרא והתגדלתי והתקדשתי האמור (ביחזקאל לח:כג) לענין מלחמת גוג ומגוג שאז יתגדל שמו של הקב\"ה דכתיב ביום ההוא יהיה ד' אחד ושמו אחד. ויאמר הדלית דיתגדל ויתקדש בצירי כי הוא עברי ולא תרגום [עיין בב\"י] ולא בשני שוואין כאלו התיו והגימל בשווא אלא הגימל בפתח. וידגיש הגימל דיתגדל דלא לישתמע יתקדל לשון עורף תרגום עורף קדל. ולא ידגיש ביותר הב' דיתברך</p>\n\n\n",

I've seen some people saying \"Aleichem Shalom\" together with the person responding to their \"Sholom Aleichem\".</p>\n\n<p>Is this a custom? Is there a source for it? I didn't see anything written about it in the Siddur.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7167&st=&pgnum=56\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7167&st=&pgnum=56</a></p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Zohar HaLevana explains that the reason we say Shalom Aleichem and then say Aleichem Shalom together, is that the first day Eliyahu Hanavi comes to announce the coming of Moshiach (three days before Moshiach comes), he will say \"Shalom Ba L'olam, Shalom Ba L'olam\". Therefore, after we say \"Dovid Melech Yisroel...\" (which refers to Moshiach) we also say Shalom twice, in the form of \"Shalom Aleichem, Aleichem Shalom\". [and if so, why do we not say it before \"Dovid Melech...\"? Because real peace will only come once Moshiach comes.] </p>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%207%20Ron.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zvi Ron</a> quotes 16th Century Kabbalist R' Hertz as follows (see page 246 footnote 26):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>after\n  praying for the coming of the Messiah by saying ‘David, King of\n  Israel, is alive and enduring,’ “since the birth pangs of the Messiah\n  are many, it is incumbent upon us to pray and say each person to his\n  friend ‘Shalom Aleichem, Aleichem Shalom.’ ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are a few different customs.  I asked 2 different Rabbanim about this after noticing that my Siddur said to say \"Shalom Aleichem\" to 1 person 3 times and not finding a satisfactory explanation for the difference in the Tur, Shulchan Aruch or Mishna Berura.  One of the Rabbanim came back a few weeks later and told me the following: (He said he looked in a Sefer that explained different Minhagim but I don't recall what the name was.)</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 different Minhagim in regards to \"Shalom Aleichem\"in Kiddush Levana, both of which are valid.  The most common practice is to say it 1 time to 3 different people, which makes sense as this is the normal way to greet people.  The other Minhag is to say \"Shalom Aleichem\" three times to one person.  Incidentally I recall listening to a pre-recorded Shiur on YUTorah.org in which Rav Schachter said the 2nd Minhag was Rav Soloveitchik ZT\"L's custom.</p>\n\n<p>As to what you saw, that wasn't mentioned.  If it is a Minhag, it must be rooted in a desire to say every word, but a concern for Shome'a K'Oneh, meaning that if someone simply answers \"Aleichem Shalom\", they've essentially said \"Shalom Aleichem\" to however many people prior to saying it themselves.  I don't know if that applies to Kiddush Levana or not though.</p>\n\n<p>As a total side point, if you look in the Artscroll Siddur with the English, it says to say \"Shalom Aleichem\" once to 3 people.  The Hebrew Siddurim says the inverse - 3x to 1 person.  This is the true for both Nusach Ashkenaz and Sefard - I checked.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason for doing the Targum one time, he says, is that it too was given at Sinai, and is necessary (or was, in Talmudic times) for the person to understand what he's learning.</p>\n\n<p>The commentary Magen HaElef on Siddur R' Amram Gaon <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14439&pgnum=56\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">offers</a> a different reason, and also uses it to explain why the reward for doing this is long life. It goes back to the time when people who got an aliyah were expected to read their own portion (as is still done in Yemenite communities); to do so takes prior preparation - reviewing the portion at least twice. If one is careful to do שמו\"ת, then, he will always be able to receive an aliyah if one is offered to him, and will thereby merit the Torah's blessing of long life (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 30:20</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <em>Mord'chai</em> on <em>B'rachos</em> (#19) implies that the reason for the practice is to familiarize oneself with the words of the Torah. Ramifications of this law include the automatic fulfilment of it by teachers of Torah to children and the fact that a commentary is a valid substitute for the translation. Others disagree, holding that there is special significance to Unkelus's translation and that meanings absent from the commentaries are conferred by it (See Tosafos on 8a, s.v. \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.8a.30-8b.1?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Berakhot.8a.30.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> <strong>שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום</strong></a>\".).</p>\n\n<p>That this practice should enable one more than simple scheduled familiarity and actually preparation for the weekly public reading is implied by the <em>Shibolei Haleket</em> (#75) when it specifies that one should finish his reading before heading to shul in the morning. (Although it does state that failing to do so, one should still read it before eating anything later that day. Furthermore, <em>Kol Bo</em> (#37) even opines that in such circumstances one may read up until Wednesday.) It also may be the implication of Rambam in <em>Hilchos T'fila Un'si'as Kapayim</em>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.13.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13:25</a>, when he disqualifies hearing the weekly public reading from being a fulfilment of the obligation.</p>\n\n<p>A very interesting limitation to this practice is made in a responsum (#88) of the <em>Ra'ava\"n</em> when he explains that <em>sh'nayim mikra v'echad targum</em> applies (or was originally intended) only for individuals who live in secluded cities without a <em>minyan</em>. They are to emulate a fulfilment of public reading by reading once for each of the two people reading directly out of the Torah and once for the real-time translator who it was the custom to follow along for public comprehension <strong>at the exact time it was being read elsewhere in public</strong>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Two answers that were given <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/berachos/insites/br-dt-008.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<p>(a) The Gemara later on (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.55a.7-9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 55a</a>) says that if one refrains from reading the Torah when he is called upon to read, this \"shortens one's days and years.\" If he prepares the Parshah two times, he becomes sufficiently familiar with the words and is able to read from the Torah in the event that he is called upon. He thereby avoids having his days and years shortened, and he merits long life. (<strong>Rav Elazar Moshe Horowitz</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>(b) One who disciplines himself and arranges his schedule in order to ensure that he has time to read the Parshah twice and its Targum once each week shows that he appreciates the value of time and uses it productively.

    "content": "# Peer-to-Peer Lending Websites\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are websites (such as Prosper.com or LendingClub.com) which allow laypeople to lend money to borrowers with interest.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a typical listing posted by a potential borrower is one in which he submits to a credit check by the website and self-reports the reasons necessitating a loan and how he plans to pay back the money. Based on his credit rating and a bidding strategy by the borrower (who may offer a higher rate in order to ensure full funding of the loan), an interest rate is set. Rates offered typically range from 7.5%-30.99%. Thus, one may ask for $10,000 at 15% annually over a three-year period in order to consolidate one's loans or build an extension on one's home. The facilitating website may then take 1% off of all payments as a service fee.</p>\n\n<p>Potential lenders can then browse the various listings on the site. After seeing a listing, a lender can offer to fund part of a loan. For diversification purposes, lenders typically offer only between $50-$200 toward any one loan. Once the full amount of the loan has been funded by the lenders, the loan goes through. I believe the borrower executes a loan agreement with the facilitating website, which then distributes shares to the corresponding lenders. The borrower will then make monthly payments of principal and interest and this will be distributed to the lenders' accounts. If a borrower defaults, the lenders will not receive any more payments. The loan will be sent to a collection agency, and if they recover anything, the recovery amount (minus substantial collection fees) will be given to the lenders.</p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid various issues (violence, violation of privacy, etc.) lenders and borrowers use usernames and are completely pseudonymous.</p>\n\n<p>In light of this, would it be permitted for a Jew to utilize this site as either a lender or borrower? The major concern would be lending to a Jew with interest or borrowing from a Jew with interest. However, one does not know whether the borrower or lender are Jewish, and on a global scale, or even in the United States, the chances of a random person on the internet being Jewish are rather slim. Additionally, maybe there is room for leniency on account of the fact that someone else will lend the money no matter what you do. I don't know how useful these retorts are, which is why I am posing this to community.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>I once asked the Business Halacha Institute whether I can lend on LendingClub, and they said it is permitted, since you can assume the borrowers are non-Jews. </p>\n\n<p>I asked another rabbi, and he said you shouldn't lend to a large number of people at once since then it's likely that one of them is Jewish. Since approximately 98.3% of the USA is non-Jewish, this would mean you shouldn't lend to 41 people at once. (Unless even less than a <em>rov</em> would be a problem.) </p>\n\n<p>I assume the business halacha institute holds you evaluate each loan on its own and can follow the strong rov that it is permitted, without worrying about statistics that say one of  them might be Jewish. But assumably you can just space out the time that the loans are offered to avoid any issue. </p>\n\n\n",

How does it compare to the סטן?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I saw the following ideas in The Encyclopedia of Talmudic Disputes and Perspectives:  R. Yochanan and Resh Lakish by R. Nachman Cohen, which attempts to apply a few \"big ideas\" which divide R\"Y and R\"L as the reasons behind their many disagreements:</p>\n\n<p>Resh Lakish holds that the Yetzer Hara is a creation unto itself and enters the human causing him to sin.  The source is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Resh Lakish said: A person does not\n  transgress a sin unless he is invaded\n  by a spirit of insanity (R. Cohens\n  traslation- Demon of Frivolity)...\n  (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=3&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah 3a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea of an outside force causing sin is in line with another statement made by Resh Lakish:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Satan, the Yetzer Hara and the\n  Angel of Death are the same...  (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=16&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava\n  Basra 16a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Cohen posits that not everyone agrees with the idea of an outside force causing sin, but rather that the \"Yetzer Hara\" and Yetzer Tov\" are manifestations of the human condition.  While he brings many chachamim who agree to this (R' Avraham ben haRambam, Rabeinu Bachye and R' Yisrael Salanter), his sole Talmudic source is a Midrash Tanchuma (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14123&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Breishis 7</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...If you say 'why did He create the\n  Yetzer Hara...is one (now) able to do\n  good?'  Hashem said 'You make it bad! \n  Why does a child of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9\n  not sin; rather from 10 and on he\n  empowers his Yetzer Hara'...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash continues to blame a persons inability to control his Yetzer hara on his apathy.</p>\n\n<p>R. Cohen makes an assumption that R. Yochanan holds of the latter approach.  He applies these different approaches to other differences between R\"L and R'Y.  For example, R\"L held that a wicked person who repents is greater than he was before sinning, because his pure soul reached a higher level through love of G-d (Tanchuma- R\"L on Yechezkel 18:27), whereas R\"Y held that a soul that sins is no longer pure, but internally damaged and cannot return to its former state even through repentance (based on Breishis Rabba 21:8).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong>  Some hold that the Yetzer haRa is an external force.  Others hold it is a manifestation of the human condition.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>אמר ר\"ל הוא שטן הוא יצר הרע הוא מלאך המות </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara Bava Basra 16. says that the Satan, the Yetzer Hara, and the Malach Hamaves are all one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that it is the temptation toward the physical. As a result of this definition it is not categorically bad (nor is the <em>yetzer tov</em> necessarily good). Only the majority of the time does it lead people to negative/destructive things. However, when it overtook the <em>yetzer tov</em>, that was enough to <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94%3a%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%95_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">seal the world's fate</a> for annihilation by flood.</p>\n\n\n",

The validity of our received tradition, and thus the miracles recorded therein, is not something that can be proven through science.</p>\n\n<p>As for <em>explaining</em> our belief in the truth of torah, one can ask: Is there anything that Ha-Kadosh Baruch Hu cannot do?  The torah describes miracles, which were either performed on the spot by God (the pshat) or programmed into the creation of the world (Rambam, Introduction to Pirkei Avos, Ch. 8).  God can act in the world; this doesn't obligate Him to do so in the future (\"why don't we see giant fish swallowing people nowadays?\"), but it also does not preclude it (e.g. resurrection).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>As I understand it, Maimonides in his Guide to the Perplexed mentioned that some Jewish philosophers had gone so far as to say the very existence of Biblical characters such as Abraham was allegorical -- that's going too far. Maimonides himself interprets certain episodes of angelic interaction in the Torah as dreams, allegories, or the like, which (unsurprisingly) ruffles some traditionalist feathers.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that the standard, normative understanding of Jewish faith would be that the Jonah story actually occurred. I think, and I could be wrong here, that if someone chose to understand it as allegory or a dream or the like, however, Jewish Law would not treat him/her as a heretic (<em>koifer</em> in your question), as their belief would not be in violation of the Thirteen Principles of Faith (while \"I believe that all the words of the prophet are true\"; a dream or allegory could be \"truth\", <em>I presume</em>); just as the rabbis of the Talmud themselves debated whether <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1237.htm\">Ezekiel's vision of the Dry Bones</a> was a physical reality, or just something seen in a prophetic trance. (Though Ezekiel opens the story with a prophetic-vision experience...)</p>\n\n<p>To agree with Monica, I don't think there is going to be the <em>a-ha, gotcha!</em> that's going to do it for an atheist, certainly with regards to a story like this. We believe that G-d can do anything, including bending the laws of nature as needed.</p>\n\n<p>A more interesting question is to transcend the <em>how</em> and ask <em>why</em> (as Lord Sacks likes to say, science is the how, religion is the why): why the whale (or \"great fish\", whatever it was)? As I read it, Jonah's job was a prophet, and he had to go warn Nineveh. Now he had all sorts of reasons why he didn't want to do his job -- Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, which would go on to attack Israel, not to mention make us look awfully bad that we ignored all our prophets' calls to repent). But that's not our place. G-d is G-d, and we are humans. Once Jonah started by breaking that order, he starts to see the laws of physics go topsy-turvy around him. This explains the epilogue to the book that the Midrash fills in, where Jonah bows down and says, \"Okay G-d now I get it; the world is Yours and You do with it as You wish.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>How to explain to an atheist? Don't look to Johnny:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nine-year-old Joey was asked by his mother what he had learned in Sunday School.</p>\n<p>'Well, Mom, our teacher told us how God sent Moses behind enemy lines on a rescue mission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt . When he got to the Red Sea, he had his army build a pontoon bridge and all the people walked across safely. Then he radioed headquarters for reinforcements. They sent bombers to blow up the bridge and all the Israelites were saved.'</p>\n<p>'Now, Joey, is that really what your teacher taught you?' his Mother asked.</p>\n<p>'Well, no, Mom. But, if I told it the way the teacher did, you'd never believe it!'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We don't change the Torah or our religion in order to make it more palatable to atheists. If they don't believe it because of miracle X, and they do not believe in miracles, then that is fine. If you deliberately strip out all the miracles, such that Moses builds a pontoon bridge to cross the Red Sea, then you are left without religion or belief in God's intervention in the world anyway.</p>\n<p>That is not to say that other concerns should not lead to a naturalistic explanation of Biblical miracles. Various Rishonim were led by their philosophic beliefs to interpret verses in a naturalist fashion (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/76997/did-rationalist-rishonim-naturalize-miracles-if-so-why\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=sqmMqbZwTXEC&lpg=PA76&ots=uCXj4lVeiJ&dq=jewish%20rationalists%20miracles%20perfection%20creation&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=jewish%20rationalists%20miracles%20perfection%20creation&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this book</a> for examples.)</p>\n<p>And there is a rather strong basis in the Biblical verses to say that God manipulated nature. For instance, see how the wind dried up the waters in the Reed Sea. Or how the wind carried the locust plague in Egypt, where we know from observation nowadays that locusts regularly migrate along that path.</p>\n<p>Speaking for myself, I can empathize with your desire to explain Yonah as metaphor. However, this is <strong>not</strong> because of the big fish part. But because as a student of literature, Yonah reads to me (in style and substance) like a morality play and a lesson about the importance and nature of repentance, and theologically why God allows it. The prophet delivering the message, the sailors, the city of Ninveh, and even the animals (in almost comical fashion) all repent. While the style and substance does not prove that the story is not historical, it is suggestive or supportive of it, much in the manner that the style and substance of sefer Iyov is suggestive that it was not intended as historically true. I believe that various midrashim from Chazal may be read to support an metaphorical interpretation as well, so personally, I would not view this as out of bounds.</p>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon interpreted the entire book as an allegory about the soul and physical world. Of course, taking the book as allegory does not preclude it also being historically true. Regardless, that one can look at the book and see metaphor lends credence to the idea that the book may be interpreted (solely) metaphorically. According to Efodi, Rambam did not believe that it took place historically. Ibn Caspi interpreted the miracles in the book as Yonah's dream. So this is not without some level of precedent.</p>\n<p>But don't water it down just to make it palatable for an atheist.</p>\n\n\n",

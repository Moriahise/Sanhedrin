    "content": "# תשוקה העצמית - is this term used anywhere else?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31674&st=&pgnum=8&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ר״ה, רנ״ז</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholom_Dovber_Schneersohn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rebbe Rashab</a> uses the term \"תשוקה העצמית\" to describe Hashem's desire for a <em>dira betachtonim</em>, a dwelling among the lowest beings/in the lowest world:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופי׳ שנשתוקק הקב״ה לבראותו הוא שיש בזה <strong>תשוקה העצמית</strong> דא״ס ב״ה, דזה\nהי׳ תחלת הכוונה שיומשך ויתגלה בעולם למטה בחי׳ <strong>התשוקה העצמית</strong> דא״ס שהוא\nבחי׳ שעשועי המלך בעצמותו כו׳, ונמצא דמה שארז״ל שנשתוקק הקב״ה לבראותו\nהוא ענין א׳ עם מה שאמרו שנתאווה הקב״ה להיות לו דירה בתחתונים, דענין\nדירה בתחתונים מורה על המשכה עצמית וכמו עד״מ אדם הדר בתוך הבית הרי כל\nעצמותו הוא בתוך הבית כמו״כ הו״ע דירה בתחתונים דבחי׳ עצמיות א״ס ב״ה\nיומשך למטה כו׳</p>\n<p>And the explanation of “He longed” is that the Holy One, blessed be\nHe, longed to create it, meaning there is in this the <strong>essential\nneed/desire</strong> of Ein Sof, blessed be He. For this was the beginning of the\nintention: that in the world below should be drawn forth and revealed\nthe aspect of the <strong>essential need/desire</strong> of Ein Sof, which is the\naspect of the King’s delight in His essence, etc. Thus,\nwhat our Sages said, that the Holy One, blessed be He, longed to\ncreate it, is the same matter as what they said, that the Holy One,\nblessed be He, desired [nit’aveh] to have a dwelling place in the\nlower realms. For the idea of a dwelling place in the lower realms\nindicates an essential drawing forth. Just as, by way of analogy, when\na man dwells in his house, all his essence is within the house, so too\nthe concept of a dwelling place in the lower realms is that the aspect\nof the Essence of Ein Sof, blessed be He, be drawn below, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/BDB%2C_%D7%AA%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%A9%D7%81%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%A7%D6%B8%D7%94?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תְּשׁוּקָה</a>, used to describe a wife's longing and emotional need for her husband (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.16?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 3:16</a>, and a husband's need for his wife - see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.75a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 75a</a>), as well as Hashem's longing and need for Yisrael (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.7.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 7:11</a>), is a very enigmatic word. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%94&tab=text&tpathFilters=Tanakh&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Used only 3 times in the whole Tanach</a>, it is perhaps one of, if not the most romantic and loving words there is between two lovers (interestingly, it is also used to describe the <em>yeitzer hara's</em> longing for us! See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 4:7</a>).</p>\n<p>How much more powerful is the phrase \"תשוקה העצמית\"! <em>Essential</em> need, arising from the very core of one's self, one's identity.</p>\n<p>I have done a lot of searching and I can't find this term used anywhere else. It is beautiful, and I would like to know if this is a wonderful innovation of the Rebbe Rashab, or if he is transmitting it from an older source. Perhaps others here have more access/better search engines than me so please let me know if you find this term anywhere else, used this way.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Believers sons of believers - how is lack of belief explained?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a principle that the Jewish soul inherits an automatic belief in Hashem from the Patriarchs such that we are \"believers, sons of believers\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.97a.4?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 94a</a>)</p>\n<p>There are some, such as Chassidim, who hold by this principle literally, and also very <em>strongly</em> - <em><strong>every Jew</strong></em>, from birth, <em><strong>believes in Hashem</strong></em>, e.g. as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovber_Schneuri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mittler Rebbe</a> writes in part 3 of <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15891&st=&pgnum=173\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ענין ברכת חתנים</a> (דרושי חתונה א):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יתכן על האמונה [ציווי] כלל כי האמונה היא בבחי׳ עצמיות וטבעיות בכל\nא׳ מישראל מיד שיבוא לכלל דעת קצת מאמין בה׳ אמונה חזקה ונפלאה עד שתהא\nכמו טבע בנפשו ואין צריך לימוד וראי׳ לזה כלל שהרי הנשים וקטנים שם שמים\nשגור בפיהם באמונה חזקה מאד בלי הקדם לימוד מאביהם בזה כלל וידוע שרש זה\n[הוא] לפי שהאמונה היא ירושה בכל נפש מישראל מהאבות וכמ״ש מה יפה\nירושתינו כו׳ ואברהם אבינו ע״ה אחד הי׳ המאמין הראשון כמ״ש והאמין בה׳\nכו׳ וישראל נק׳ מאמינים בני מאמינים עד שהקטן מיד שיגדיל בדעת קצת יאמין\nכמו הגדול בדעת ממש כידוע</p>\n<p>...it is not possible at all that there be a command concerning\n<em>emunah</em>, for <em>emunah</em> is in an aspect of essentiality and naturalness in every single Jew. As soon as he comes to a little awareness, he\nbelieves in God with a strong and wondrous <em>emunah</em>, until it is like\na nature in his soul, and it requires no study. And this has no need\nof proof at all, for women and children have the Name of Heaven fluent\nin their mouths with very strong <em>emunah</em>, without any prior\ninstruction from their father in this at all.</p>\n<p>And it is known that the root of this is that <em>emunah</em> is an\ninheritance in every Jewish soul from the Patriarchs, as it is said:\n“How beautiful is our inheritance…”. And Avraham our father, peace be\nupon him, was the first believer, as it is written: “And he believed\nin Hashem,” and Israel are called “believers, the children of\nbelievers,” to the point that even a small child, as soon as he\nincreases a little in awareness, believes just as a great one in\nawareness, literally, as is known.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I would like to ask, for those that hold this point of view, how exactly do they explain what's going on with regards to Jews who say and/or feel that they do not believe?</strong></p>\n<p>[I am not looking for people to disprove this point of view or argue from a different point of view]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Kook</a>, in his essay Kirvas Elokim (published in <a href=\"https://beitel.co.il/products/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%94-%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maamarei Haraayah</a>, p. 32) discusses this exact idea. He says that the desire to be close to Hashem exists in <em>every</em> soul, not just Jewish ones. (The principle of \"maaminim bnei maaminim\" would, in this case, just refer to a greater degree of awareness as a result of the higher level of neshamah that a Jew possesses.) He says that this can be seen through a historical examination of societies, all of whom have pursued of a relationship with any sort of deity, be it Hashem or otherwise; and he says that in today's generation, it becomes covered up by of all sorts of -isms but it can never be eliminated completely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואחרי המשך של בחינות שונות בחזיונות החיים לכל מצביהם ואפניהם נוכח עוד, שכל רובי הצפריעים והמתנגדים לה, שנולדו על ידי הסתבכות החיים החומריים והרוחניים, יוכלו רק למעט לאיזה משך זמן את התגלותה ואת שלטונה על תהלוכות המעשה והמחשבה של האדם, אבל בשום אפן לא לבטלה, לכבשה ולעצרה לגמרי.</p>\n<p>And after continuing to examine various visions of life in all its states and aspects, it is further evident that all the many critics and opponents of [a relationship with Hashem], born of the entanglement of material and spiritual life, will only be able to delay its manifestation and its rule over the processions of human action and thought for a certain period of time, but in no way to abolish it, conquer it, and arrest it completely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman discusses this concept as well, in <a href=\"https://breslov.org/what-is-likutey-moharan/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Moharan</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Likutei_Moharan.282.2.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah 282</a>, where he says that every Jew as a \"nekudah tovah\" buried deep inside and we are required to see it - even, as the commentaries point out, that nekudah tovah is just being Jewish. He discusses a similar idea in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Likutei_Moharan.56.3.19?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah 56</a>, where he talks about the concept of \"hastarah shebetoch hahastarah,\" saying that a Jew doesn't even know how far he is from Hashem. We can correlate this with a lack of belief. When we put those two concepts together, we have a Jew possessing a spark inside of him which can never be extinguished and which may be so covered up or far from Hashem that the Jew himself doesn't realize - but he's still connected, and with enough effort that spark will be revealed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Seeking Honour L'shem Shamayim - how can one pursue teaching Torah without \"seeking honour\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems like we should be averse to honour, and many stories and aggada drill that home, including the famous \"those who chase greatness will have it flee from them, those who run away from it will be pursued by it\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.13b.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 13b</a>), and \"do not seek greatness for yourself, and do not covet honour\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.6.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 6:5</a>)</p>\n<p>However, it seems that if one truly does know the truth, and has wisdom to teach it and influence others for good, honour would be an extremely important tool. People listen to those who they respect, and ignore those who they don't. Therefore, a true Talmid Chacham <em>should</em> hope for honour, purely <em>l'shem shamayim</em>! So he can teach Torah!</p>\n<p><strong>I would say that there is nowhere in Torah that teaches that we should seek honour <em>l'shem shamayim</em>. Am I being ignorant? If so, please bring me sources that do explain this</strong> (it would indeed go well with the second half of the proverb in Eruvin, as why else would it bother to tell us how honour is achieved, if we are meant to <em><strong>only</strong></em> avoid it?)*</p>\n<p><strong>If I am right, and this is against the Torah, why? What's wrong with my argument?</strong> Is it that we should <em><strong>always</strong></em> leave honour to Hashem's Hashgacha? Is it that honour is so bad for our soul that there's no viable way to \"seek\" or \"pray for\" it? Is it that honour is reserved for Olam Haba and it's not relevant to this life at all - even the fact that it would help a Talmid Chacham influence people for good is not important enough to make honour something for Olam Hazeh? Is it simply that seeking honour, and \"<em>l'shem shamayim</em>\" are oxymorons?</p>\n<p>Either way, <em>l'ma'aseh</em>, what <em>should</em> someone knowledgable in Torah, with a desire to teach, do? Practically? If he must hate honour and take no steps to gain people's respect, does that equate to him quenching his mission (and desire) to teach? Should he aim to teach a tiny, irrelevant class that nobody attends, perhaps even <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71143/31534\">actively lying to people about how knowledgable he is</a> (and definitely not doing this while secretly hoping people will come to respect him and his Torah anyway)? If not, then <strong>how can one pursue teaching Torah without \"seeking honour\"?</strong></p>\n<p><sup>* some might claim that the answer is that it's ok to seek honour for Torah, and therefore if one learns a lot of Torah, he can expect and even demand a lot of honour for said Torah that is in him. I'm not sure that that will be a truly satisfying answer. Not everyone who knows a lot is good at communicating it, for example, and it's still going to involve some level of seeking personal honour - it just has to. People have to honour you first, before they can find out that you are filled with honourable Torah! As I said, people only really listen to people they already respect...</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, what does “invalid” mean here, God still \"heard\" the tefillah?</p>\n<p>Especially, adding in the fact that now it made all those brachos, brachos levatala.

    "content": "# Footnotes on the bottom of the pages of \"Doros HaRishonim\" by Rabbi Y.Y. Rabinowitz\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20280&st=&pgnum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20280&st=&pgnum=16</a></p>\n<p>Are the footnotes on the bottom of this sefer written by the author of the sefer, Rabbi Rabinowitz?  Or were they authored by someone else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The footnotes are clearly those of an author, not of an editor (same style as main text, additional arguments and ideas rather than editorial work). Only the footnote on the first page is incomplete, and beginning with the parentheses (הערה זו...) is added by the editor. Footnotes in other volumes of the work are also written by the author (the preface mentions that this posthumous volume was not as revised as the other volumes in the series).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Doesn't look like it. Earlier in that very volume it says it was put out by Mossad HaRav Kook, which are known to add many scholarly footnotes to their works. There's an introduction by a Rav Y. L. Fishman and a preface by Dr. B. M. Levine, so perhaps they contributed to the footnotes. I didn't see any other indication who contributed.</p>\n<p>I found the same edition on <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/15078/p/1/t/9525969801234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar HaChochmah</a> but in a seemingly older format. There, it adds a copyright page to a Dr. B. M. Lewin (Levine), who I cited above. It would seem then that he put the footnotes.</p>\n\n\n",

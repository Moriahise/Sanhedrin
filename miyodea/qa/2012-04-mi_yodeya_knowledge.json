Although the cameras operate for security purposes, the passerby does not benefit from being photographed. One only benefits from the system when there’s an unwelcome intruder. Thus, one may walk in front of a camera on Shabbos <strong>as this is a case of <em>pesik reisha delo nicha lei</em> (see Shulchan Aruch OC 320:18) which is permitted in a rabbinic prohibition</strong>. Likewise, one may operate a surveillance camera. R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (quoted in Ateres Shlomo 6, p57) concurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the passage i bolded, we see that the reason Rav Moshe allowed it is that it is a <em>psik reisha d'lo neicha lei</em> -- an unavoidable <em>melacha</em> that he does not benefit from.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the case by a video chat. Here, the person being videoed definitely does benefit from it -- that's the whole point of leaving it on.

However, I wonder if it falls under medical necessity in terms of hooking up to someone in the hospital.

It is conceivable that one might have clothing or jewelry of considerable value that one might specifically want to wear only on Shabbath.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the RaMBa\"M gives a few examples of items under this category, and they all tend to be professional items, ie., tools of the trade. They might not be prohibited as Kelim SheMelachtam LeIsur (vessels whose [primary] functions are prohibited [and are thus prohibited from being moved under the general rules of Muktzeh]), because their functions may actually be permissible on Shabbath, however, they tend, nonetheless, to be items that one would use in a professional capacity and that, therefore, one may pay a high price to purchase/replace.</p>\n\n<p>Do the above considerations mean that expensive jewelry, watches, clothing, etc., do not fall under this category? Does it mean that they MIGHT NOT fall under this category GIVEN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES? If the latter, what would those circumstances be (are they definable, or is it a \"know it when you see it\" type of situation)? Are there other parameters, other types of things that are very valuable, that do not (or might not) fall under this category?</p>\n\n<p>(Inspired by the question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8725/5\">\"When is a watch a watch?\"</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I've never done this before (that I recall), but I have just found what I consider to be the definitive answer to my own question.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shulchanaruch.com/YPS/samples/Shiur%2042.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In this Shi'ur</a> on the subject, it is clear that:</p>\n\n<p>A.

See SS”K (Sh’miras Shabbos Kehilchasa) 20-19. The reason is because there is always a slight chance that one would use these keilim on Shabbos, and therefore they are not cast aside from one’s mind.</p>\n  \n  <p>However there are two exceptions:<br>\n  1. Merchandise – even keilim shel heter; and one is makpid about them, are muktze.<br>\n  2. Valuable items, even if they are keilim shel heter, but one does not move them around because they might get damaged and ruined, since they have a fixed position they are muktze. See SS”K 20-22. Therefore a grandfather clock or a picture one is very careful with, are muktze.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(This would be especially convenient in some instances, such as if you've prepared a large dairy meal and realized after the first bite or two that you still have 'X' amount of time to wait until your traditional waiting period ends, after which you will be exceedingly hungry, and/or your meal will no longer be fresh.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: </p>\n\n<p>I'm also curious if you can go back to eating meat immediately (assuming you normally wait some period after milk before eating meat, or even if the milk product you ate requires you normally to wait the same length of time you wait after meat).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Kaf HaChaim in siman 89 #8 writes in the name of דע׳ק If one forgets and starts to eat cheese during the six hours, he may finish and he does not need to stop. He also does not need to fast because of this mistake, being that there is no issue of eating issur here, it is merely a safeguard. </p>\n\n<p>Chacham Ovadia Yosef in his commentary on the Ben Ish Chai called  Halichos Olam brings this opinion and remarks this only applies to Ashkenazim who hold only one hour is the accepted halacha, the next five are only a minhag. He writes that Sfardim who hold six hours is the accepted halacha as per the Mechaber should not rely on this ruling. IIRC he expressed some disappointment that the Kaf HaChaim wrote this in his work which was mostly aimed at Sfardim, as if it applied to them.</p>\n\n<p>Of course CYLOR whether to rely on this or not. I personally did ask my Rosh Yeshiva way back when if I can rely on this is ruling, if it would ever come up, and he said yes, unless I find a more contemporary Ashkenazi posek who brings this and argues on it.</p>\n\n<p>Notice though the Kaf HaChaim made no distinction between the first hour and the subsequent ones, unlike Chacham Ovadia.

    "content": "# Did hardening Paro's heart mean he wasn't really responsible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As a child I often wondered how, if God kept hardening Paro's heart after each plague, it could really be Paro's fault.  It sounds like God was setting him up to fail, and while that's God's prerogative, it seems kind of unfair, and we hold that God is just.</p>\n\n<p>Now I realize (as an adult) that that's not really what's going on, but it's still troubling.  If Paro was evil and deserving of retribution then he shouldn't have needed help; if, as suggested by some commentaries I've read, he was actually ready to relent but God needed to demonstrate His power to the world, then it makes me wonder why miracles can't stand on their own.  (If Egypt needed to receive the plagues then God could have just done that without giving Paro a chance to repent.)</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: why did God need to harden Paro's heart and, in particular, what are good ways to explain this to children?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The explanation I always give is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>God never takes away a person's free will.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If God wants to influence a person's choice, He does just that - influences it. He does not force it. He will manipulate external factors so that the decision will be influenced in a certain direction.</p>\n\n<p>Let me give an example: Bill is buying a new car. He has free will to choose whichever model car he would like to buy. Now, suppose for whatever reason, God would like Bill to choose model X. Bill might be influenced in his decision by several factors: (1) Bill's neighbor got model X and loves it. (2) Bill's friend got competing model Y, and Bill doesn't want to look like a copycat. (3) Bill hears of someone who got in a terrible accident due to a car that lacks feature A, which model X is known for. (4) Bill will have had a childhood experience involving model X or similar, which makes him sentimental toward it. Etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Because of these factors, Bill chooses model X. He is not <em>forced</em> to, but is <em>influenced</em> in his decision by external factors, which are perhaps manipulated by God to push him toward this decision.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, \"God hardened Paro's heart\" means that God provided experiences in Paro's life and surroundings to influence his decision to not allow Israel to leave Egypt. He still, using his free will could have made the right decision, but he willingly chose not to. It might not have been as easy to make the right decision, but he is still responsible for not doing so. Thus, he was justly punished.</p>\n\n<p>Now, why did God need to \"harden\" Paro's heart? The answer commonly given for this is that God wanted Israel to be slaves in Egypt for a certain amount of time as a prerequisite for properly accepting the Torah. Egypt is described as a \"furnace of iron\" (I Kings 8:51), in which the metal is rid of imperfections and prepared to be formed properly. Additionally, God felt that the plagues on Egypt were also necessary to show Israel and the rest of the world how powerful and devoted He is. Therefore, God wanted Paro to make the decision to keep Israel in Egypt for their own benefit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I am surprised that no one has mentioned the Rambam's opinion. He addresses this question in Hilchos Teshuva (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%95\">6:3</a>), and says quite simply that yes, sometimes freewill is withheld from someone. The reason it was not unfair to punish Pharaoh after his heart had been hardened and he'd <strong>lost his freewill</strong> is because he deserved it. Rambam explains that since he had plotted and carried out such wicked things, he simply did not deserve the chance to be absolved of his sins without punishment, and so <strong>as part of his punishment</strong> remorse was blocked from him and his heart was hardened.</p>\n\n<p>In general I don't know why people are bothered by the concept that freewill doesn't always exist. Whoever said it has to? As long as we are not punished or rewarded for things we do purely as a result of being \"under the influence,\" what's the big deal in assuming we sometimes are?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in his Commentary explains that God did not “<em>harden</em> Pharaoh’s heart” so much as “allow Pharaoh’s heart to be hardened”. This was achieved allowing Pharaoh to (incorrectly) perceive limits to God’s power in bringing the plagues.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Hirsch translates Exodus 9:30–32 as a single quote, something like (adapting the JPS translation from <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/\">http://mechon-mamre.org/</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup>30</sup> “But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. <sup>31</sup> For although the flax and the barley were smitten (for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom) <sup>32</sup> but the wheat and the spelt were not smitten (for they ripen late).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I.e.</em>, Pharaoh is stricken with hail, but is allowed to believe that God is not actually powerful enough to destroy <em>all</em> of Egypt’s crops.  The plagues get progressively harsher, but each time God leaves Pharaoh enough room to believe that “this is as bad as it will get”.</p>\n\n<p>In the next chapter, Pharaoh’s servants recognize this tactic, demanding, “How long shall this man be a snare unto us?”  The word “snare” is interesting, implying there was something “tricky” about the presentation of the plagues although they came with full warning.</p>\n\n\n",

(sources please)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Debreciner in Shaalos U'Tshuvos Beer Moshe Chelek 3 Siman 123 says that the Minhag is to allow one to play Dreidel with their wife while she is a Niddah. However he recommends making a <em>Heker</em>* - either by each one using their own Draidel or any other type of Heker. If the entire family is playing and they are not sitting next to each other then you can even use the same Draidel.</p>\n\n<p>*Heker = An unusual item that is out of place to serve as a reminder of the changed status (in this case, Niddah)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Should be pretty much the same issue as playing Monopoly or Scrabble or whatnot with your wife. (Unless you argue that the traditional aspect to it makes it less problematic, which I don't particularly hear. Then again I'm not crazy about the whole dreidel thing anyhow, and will refer you to the responsum of Chasam Sofer lamenting that this holiday is \"celebrated\" by gambling.)</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch says one should not engage in <em>s'chok</em> or <em>kalut rosh</em> with one's wife when she is in a state of <em>Nidda</em>. Loosely translated as \"playfulness\" or \"lightheadedness.\"</p>\n\n<p>Contemporary authorities differ on something like playing board games, and may vary from case to case (e.g. playing at a table vs. lying down on the floor); though the interpretation of Shulchan Aruch I heard from Rabbi Yaakov Hopfer of Baltimore is that <em>s'chok</em> and <em>kalut rosh</em> means: behavior that is <em>suggestive</em> or <em>disinhibiting</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The view you'll hear from the yutorah world is that it depends on the norms of gender relationships in your community. If sitting down and playing a board game would only be done as a prelude to more intimate activities, then no it shouldn't be done. If it's no big deal, then it's no big deal.</p>\n\n\n",

True that Christianity is avodah zarah for us Jews; true also that it is, according to some posekim, also the same for non-Jews. Nevertheless, one of the major leniencies in this regard (alluded to by Shalom in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12219/37\">his answer to the related question</a>) is that most non-Jews nowadays aren't אדוק באמונתם, so \"frum\" that, say, receiving a gift before their holiday will make them run to church to thank their deity.</p>\n<p>There still is the issue of chukos hagoyim (imitating non-Jewish practices), though.</p>\n<p>On a practical level: maybe indeed it's too late for this year to do anything about it, but how about if you give them an end-of-year present (or whatever you want to call it) far enough in advance - say anytime before Thanksgiving - so that it doesn't have a direct connection to Christmas, but still shows your regard for them?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I found something else that bears on this. The Rema (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9146&pgnum=144\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoreh De'ah 148:12</a>), citing Terumas Hadeshen, says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אם שולח דורון לעובד כוכבים בזמן הזה ביום שיש להם סימן אם יגיע להם דורון בחג ההוא אם אפשר ישלח לו מבערב ואם לא ישלח לו בחג עצמו.</p>\n<p>\"Similarly, if one is sending a gift to a non-Jew in our times [by which, I guess, he means to distinguish them from the idol-worshippers of old], on the day on which they consider it significant to receive presents on that holiday: if possible, [the Jew] should send him the gift the evening before. If not, he may send it on the holiday itself.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(As Shach there :13 points out, delaying giving the gift until after the holiday would lead to איבה, the non-Jew resenting the Jew for having ignored the occasion. \"Especially nowadays,\" he says, \"when it is uncommon for them to go and thank [their deity, for the gift].\")</p>\n<p>However, in uncensored editions of Shulchan Aruch (such as <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45233&pgnum=118\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>), the reference is explicated as being to \"ביום ח' שאחר ניט\"ל שקורין ני\"א יאר\" - \"the eighth day after Christmas, which they call 'New Year.'\" Which would mean that giving a non-Jew a gift on Christmas itself might still be problematic either as supporting idolatry or as chukos hagoyim, but if you give it as a New Year's gift, there'd be more room for leniency. (Why the posekim aren't as concerned about the chukos hagoyim angle regarding New Year's, I don't know.)</p>\n<p>Though I suppose that it might be argued that conditions were different then - when the non-Jews' resentment could lead to real physical danger to the individual and to the Jewish community generally - than now.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No (Avodah Zara 2a) \nIf Christianity is considered Avodah Zarah then it is clearly assur.

Yehudah, in Berakhot (21a), the recitation of Sh'ma is merely rabbinic. Accordingly, we could suggest that the enactment to read the Torah on Monday and Thursday preceded the enactment to read the Sh'ma daily. This would be especially likely, since the enactment to read the Torah thrice weekly is very old; perhaps as old as Moshe (cf. Bava Kamma 82a, Hilkhot Tefillah 12:1).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, some claim that even according to Sh'muel, there is still a Biblical obligation to study Torah each day; just no set formula. (cf. Talmidei Rabbenu Yonah to Rif Berakhot 12b). If that were the case, or if the recitation of Sh'ma were actually Biblical, then another answer would be needed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We could suggest that the point of having Torah every three days isn't just that the individual should experience Torah periodically, for which any Torah should suffice, but rather that the Torah itself must be reviewed periodically so that it not be forgotten.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is implied by the Paneah Razza (14th cent.) who writes (Deut 10:10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יהיו לעולם ג' ימים בלא תורה ולא תשתכח</p>\n  \n  <p>And that they never go three days without Torah, and it would not be forgotten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The P'ri M'gaddim himself gives two answers. Either that one needs to lean Torah besides for Sh'ma (he does not clarify the nature of this need; indeed it seems to be an ad hoc solution). Alternatively, he suggests that there is a need to not exceed three days in Torah study from a written text in particular. (Why there would be such a need, he doesn't say).</li>\n<li>R. Betsalel Stern provides an additional reason (fifth, for anyone counting): that the recitation of Sh'ma does not count as Torah study since it is meant specifically to fulfill its own obligation. (B'tsel HaHokhmah vol. I:1).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[Note that his assumption about the recitation of Sh'ma not fulfilling the obligation of Torah study is dubious. Cf.

So that takana must have been trying to accomplish more, probably to have a public reading, perhaps also to learn something new every week. The public reading has its own birchas haTorah on it, so its clearly quite significant. (Some even say its birchas haTorah is md'oraysa.) There can be different reasons for its significance. It is a Kiddush Hashem b'rabim, and perhaps its public nature is a recreation of Matan Torah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Because it is not done through a way of learning, rather a way of praying and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/33633/2\">declaring belief</a> etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The laws behind the separation of men and women\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Israel there is a hot debate because of instances on some communities where extra steps are taken to separate men and women in every day life. For example in some bus lines women seat in the back of the bus, and a community tried to have separate sidewalks.</p>\n\n<p>What are the halakhic bases for such separation? Which texts mention in which cases they should be separated?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>PS. I am not trying to start a debate, just get some solid sources to make my own opinion.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The Gemora says that, <strong>in the Beit HaMikdash</strong>, the men and women were separated during the \"Simchas Beis Hashoeiva\". This was because the environment was so lax and fun and lightheaded they were afraid people would do inappropriate behavior in the Beit HaMikdash.</p>\n<p>After the Beit HaMikdash was destroyed, this concept was further used to create separate seating in the Beit K'nesset (shul) which has some rules similar to the Beit HaMikdash.</p>\n<p>From that point on, various communities in various places have created different rules on this topic, all using this line in the Gemora as the basis for their new separation.</p>\n<p>However, regarding the busses, another argument is based based on the line in the Gemora, which says not to walk behind a woman.  This is normally understood to mean that you don't want to be watching a woman's backend, but they apply it to say that men cannot sit behind women on the bus.  On the Jerusalem light rail train, the Charedim have agreed to make the last car in the train for men only, because the distance between the cars is enough that they don't have this \"issue.\"</p>\n<p>This mishna is further explained in <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/avot1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot D'rabbi Natan</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is written [ibid., ibid. 6]: \"None of you shall approach to any\nthat are near of kin to him.\" From this it was said one must not stay\nin a separate room with any woman in a hostelry, though she be his\nsister or daughter, because of public opinion. For the same reason one\nmust not converse with a woman in the market, not even with his wife.\nFor the same reason a man shall not walk behind a woman, even though\nshe be his wife. This was deduced from the following analogy of\nexpression: It is written in the passage of illegal unions, \"Ye shall\nnot approach,\" and here is also written, \"Thou shalt not approach,\"\nfrom which it is to be inferred that one shall not approach such\nthings as can cause him to sin (or cause people to talk about him).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"http://blog.webyeshiva.org/halacha/applying-old-halachot-to-new-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">correspondance of letters</a> between the Tzitz Eliezer and R. Shlomo Auerbach when they were in their 50s, regarding entering a bus behind a woman. (based on the statement in the Gemora not to walk behind a woman)  The end result is that they agree that it is a personal manner, and some people who are not strong should avoid entering a bus behind a woman, but it cannot be a general rule.</p>\n<p>The interesting point in the correspondence, is the fact in the 15th century, they mention that the \"times have changed\", and that in the days of the Gemora or the Rambam, it was rare to find a woman out in the marketplace. However, today, women are found all over the marketplace, and it's impossible to avoid walking behind a woman easily.  Therefore, we are lenient on this ruling.  If you are in a place where there are a few women (e.g. one or two) then, certainly, avoid walking behind them.  But, if you are in a busy place, where removing yourself from behind one woman will just make you walk behind another, then stay where you are.</p>\n<p>It is often pointed out by people today, that the Gemora and Halacha are telling a man what he should be careful in doing.  But today, there are people trying to tell the woman what they should be careful in making sure the man doesn't do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (EH 21:1) rules:</p>\n<p>צריך אדם להתרחק מהנשים מאד מאד</p>\n<p>It is necessary for a man to distance himself from women to a great extent</p>\n<p>This obligation is, I would say, naturally somewhat subjective. Because of this subjectivity, it seems that contemporary attitudes to this obligation vary from one extreme who treat it as a total platitude, to others who think that it is appropriate to transgress severe prohibitions to enforce their ideal standard of separation.</p>\n<p>With respect to buses — in addition to the very interesting correspondence between the Tzitz Eliezer and R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach — there is a p'sak by R' Moshe Feinstein permitting one to ride on a mixed bus (Igros Moshe, Even HaEzer 2:14). R' Feinstein permits this because incidental contact devoid of affection is not prohibited. Nevertheless, I do not think he belived that there was no benefit in having separate seats on buses frequented by the Orthodox public. Instead, his answer was regarding the reality that was faced on public transit. There are halachic issues than may not <i>prohibit</i> mixed seating on buses, but might best be avoided by separate seating.</p>\n<p>Regarding sidewalks (during normal times, not when there are massive events where there separate seating is appropriate and it is worthwhile to arrange separate entrances) this issue has always been around to one degree or another. To my knowledge, we have never seen this \"solution\" implemented. (This is in contrast to public transit, which is a new issue with specific concerns and the solution of separate seats was soon implemented.) I do not think it is appropriate, except perhaps in <i>extremely crowded areas</i> where it might not be feasible. I know of no Jewish areas that rise to that level, but nobody asks me. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein ruled that a man may enter a very crowded New York City subway car, even though it is very likely that he will involuntarily <strong>touch</strong> a woman.

That is a personal standard, not an absolute obligation for all of Klal Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n",

First, can the donation be used for the cost of the plaque, and second, does the donation (in its entirety, including the cost of the plaque) count towards the donor's Ma'aser?</p>\n\n<p>Another example might be if influence is gained by being a regular, large donor to a given organization.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In short, yes.</p>\n\n<p>In some rare cases, religious pursuits for the wrong reasons are viewed by the Gemara as \"poisonous\" -- Tosfos explains, if you're only studying just so you can get back at someone, that's no good.</p>\n\n<p>But generally, we say \"let a person engage in Torah and mitzvahs [there are varying texts whether it's 'Torah', 'Torah and mitzvahs', etc.] for ulterior motives, as it will bring him to the right motives.\"</p>\n\n<p>Similarly the Gemara says a person who gives a hefty sum of tzedaka in the hope that the merit will save a deathly-ill relative is an \"absolutely righteous person\", so long as they don't <em>explicitly</em> regret the donation if the relative doesn't pull through.</p>\n\n<p>The practice of noting donors is a well-established one, and if you search the Gemara you'll find parts of the Second Temple that had been dedicated by donors. Shulchan Aruch describes the practice too, as have twentieth-century responsa. (Rabbi Moshe Feinstein got some of these; as did Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg in Israel -- I recall one where an old, widowed rebbetzin donated a new Torah cover, and asked that her name be embroidered on it. The yeshiva receiving it felt it was inappropriate to have a woman's name on it -- Rabbi Waldenberg told them, in short, go jump in a lake.) </p>\n\n<p>As for costs -- it's the institution's choice how to spend the money, and if they think a plaque is in their best interest, then by all means. A charity is allowed to have some overhead. (By oral tradition from Rabbi Yaakov Kaminetsky, in theory overhead can be up to 49%).</p>\n\n<p>From a US legal perspective, as I understand it, if the benefit is purely a ritual one (such as a high holiday seat -- which wouldn't be worth anything if you weren't a member of that faith), then whatever you pay for it is a charitable donation. If you take out an ad in your synagogue's dinner journal, if you're promoting your business then that's business activity (both maaser and tax-wise, I think); if it's \"mazel tov honorees and best wishes\", that's charity as you're receiving very little dollarized benefit. (Yes, reputation, but that's amorphous.) Similarly a synagogue/school banquet seat usually costs, say, $100; if you ask they'll tell you the cost of your meal is maybe $40. So that's a $60 donation, both tax-wise and maaser-wise.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, disclaimer -- this is not official tax advice, obviously.</p>\n\n\n",

In Hebrew schools and Yeshivoth it is frequently taught, simplistically, that this is the \"source\" in the Gemara for Ḥanukah and that the Mishnah makes no mention of it (for reasons outside the scope of this question). But that's actually not true. This discussion in Shabbath draws from other places in the Talmud that discuss the holiday and its ritual lighting, most significantly pointing to the law in <a href=\"http://www.emishnah.com/PDFs/Bava%20Kamma%206.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the last Mishnah in B\"K, ch. 6</a>, discussed in <a href=\"http://dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=bava_kama&daf=62b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Kama 62b</a>, that one is not financially culpable if a damaging fire is ignited (G-d forbid) from one's Ḥanukah candles that were placed outside.

    "content": "# Which mitzvos exempt which mitzvos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a general rule in Halacha that someone occupied with a mitzva isn't obligated to interrupt themselves to do another mitzva. This is known as \" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osek_b%27mitzvah_patur_min_hamitzvah\" rel=\"nofollow\">עוסק במצוה פטור מן המצוה</a>\".</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what kind of mitzva does one have to be engaged in, and what kind of mitzvos are they exempt from while occupied with said mitzva?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org/learning/rambam/kriatshema/ks2.5.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">From Torah.org Rambam series</a></p>\n<p>The concept of \"Osek BMitzvah\" has three general rules. (According to the Rambam)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you are engaged in a mitzvah (meaning your mind and actions are completely engrossed in it) Then you are exempt from doing any other mitzvot.</p>\n<p>This means that wearing tzizit does not patur you from other mitzvot because wearing them does not distract you. However if you are shaliach for someone, then you do not need to stop and eat in a Sukkah while traveling. However that same Shaliach is not patur from saying the Shemah.  A Groom however, who is fully focused on his weddding, is patur from saying the Shemah.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There is an exception to rule 1.  Learning Torah never exempts you from other mitzvot.  If you are learning Torah and another Mitzvah needs to be done, then you do the other mitzvah.  For example, Saying Shema.  The reason for this is that Learning Torah is such an important mitzvah only because it leads to doing mitzvot!</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There is an exception to rule 2 as well.  If the mitzvah that presents itself, can be done by another person, and another person is in fact doing that mitzvah, then you are patur.  For example, if a poor person comes to the beis midrash and asks for a meal, if others are already giving him food then you do not need to stop learning to feed him.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to the Ran, there are extra criteria for making this distinction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(a) \"Weight\" - we generally relate to Mitzvot from the Torah with more\nseverity than those ordained by the Rabbis; for example, a \"Safek\"\n(case of doubt) is decided to the stringent side of the question if it\ninvolves a law from the Torah; it is decided to the lenient side of\nthe doubt in case it involves a Rabbinic law. Therefore, as long as\n(under normal circumstances), there will be enough time to fulfill the\nMitzva, we are not bothered by your putting it off. A \"twist\" on this\nis to incorporate the \"Safek\" issue here: Since we are not 100% sure\nthat we will complete the activity in time and be able to perform the\nMitzvah properly, let us judge the situation as a \"Safek\" - if it\ninvolves a Mitzvah from the Torah, we are stringent and interrupt; if\nit is Rabbinic, we need not interrupt.</p>\n<p>(b) \"Legislation\" - we could posit that the Rabbis, when they mandated\ncertain Mitzvot (e.g. Lulav during the rest of Sukkot after the first\nday), never legislated that it should necessitate interruption;\nwhereas Mitzvot from the Torah carry this character with them.</p>\n<p>(c) \"Nature of the Concern\" - perhaps the distinction begins from a\ndifferent issue: We don't interrupt for a Rabbinic Mitzvah, because\nour only concern is that the Mitzvah be fulfilled - \"to fulfill the\nwords of the Rabbis\"; as long as there is sufficient time, we need not\ninterrupt our [mundane] activity for the Mitzvah. Contradistinctively,\nwhen the time to perform a Mitzvah from the Torah (\"the word of God\")\nhas arrived, it is unseemly to get involved in another activity and\nthis involvement itself constitutes a \"slap\" at the Torah; the\nobligation to interrupt the activity is a response to this\nwrong-headed prioritization - putting your own needs before your\nresponsibility to God's commands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a more in depth analysis of this and related issues, see the link provided above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Herschel Shachter said in one of his classes that the exemption here only applies within either bein adam l'chaveiro or bein adam la'makom.  It does not cross this barrier.  So while on a religious mission one may be exempt from the sukkah, but not from charity.  </p>\n\n<p>(I'd love to link where he said this but don't recall).</p>\n\n\n",

Or is there something going on mathematically that just makes it nearly impossible to have a Plag in the winter? Is there something in this Shittah that could explain why many synagogues Daven Minḥah on Friday evenings in the summer well after Plag HaMinḥah as usually published in most calendars? Is M\"A's Shittah just that much later?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The MA holds that we split up the 12 hours of a day from Alot HaShachar (the beginning of day) to Tzeit HaKochavim (the end of the day). The Gra holds that the 12 hours are split from sunrise to sunset independent of what is considered day or night.</p>\n\n<p>All agree that noon must be when the sun is highest in the sky. (This can be proven from the gemara that says they waited for mincha until 6.5 hours because they wanted to make sure by seeing the shadows grow.)</p>\n\n<p>All agree also that Alot HaShachar is at observed dawn (when you can see light in the eastern sky) which is usually 60-90 minutes before sunrise (at normal latitudes).</p>\n\n<p>(Note: from here on I will be using minutes based on Israel's latitude on an equinox. For other locations everything scales accordingly. Additionally, I assume the length of a 'mil' to be 18 minutes (the most conventional opinion). For other opinions just scale accordingly.)</p>\n\n<p>There are two opinions regarding when sunset and tzeit is. To (greatly) summarize, Rabbeinu Tam holds that day ends 58.5 min after sunset, followed by 13.5 minutes of doubt, and then nightfall 72 minutes after sunset. The Gra holds that sunset is the beginning of the doubt period and nightfall is 13.5 minutes later.</p>\n\n<p>So, for the Magen Avraham, to ensure that noon stays in the middle of the day, he <em>must</em> hold of RT's version of nightfall (and that Alot is by definition the equivalent amount of time before sunrise). As such, his plag, which is 90 minutes (1.25 of his 'hours') before nightfall, ends up about 18 minutes before the Gra's sunset. But since he is holding of RT, day for him ends 76.5 minutes later! (By the solstices, MA plag can be between approx 6-30 minutes before Gra's sunset for Jerusalem latitude.)</p>\n\n<p>Since the majority of the world follows Gra times (lechumra and lekula) the website likely didn't even bother to give you the end of RT's day. But it exists!</p>\n\n<p>This explains your issue with the times.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to MA day lasts from Dawn till Tzeis Hakochavim of R.Tam. \nIt looks like Sunset on MyZmanim is calculated by other shita than R.Tam (maybe GR\"A). That's why it looks like Plag Haminha of MA is 2 minutes before sunset.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=2547\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is a source that also states this.

First question: why does he write this is he then says Gimtarya Hashem is One, when in fact it is not- Hashem is One in Hebrew is 39 and Maran wrote 40 which is not Hashem is One?</p>\n\n<p>2) Why don't at least the Ashkenazim follow the Mehaber's minhag of 7-9-11-13? </p>\n\n<p>3) There is a custom that stems back from Rav Shelomo Molecho who used to make Sisit 10-5-6-5 by individual wraps and the Hida brings that down as Halacha (and see Yalkut Yosef, Sheerit Yosef vol. 1, siman 11) to make it 10-5-6-5. However, for some reason some people took that way and mixed it with the way of the Arizal (see Shaar HaKawanot vol. 1, Tzitzit Derush 6 if I remember correctly) to make 3 Huliot and make 7-8-11-13, as brought down by Kaf HaHaim (siman 11) and the Shulhan Aruch HaRav (see Halacha Berura 11). My question is, <strong>some people took the way of the Ari and mixed it with the way of Hida</strong>. The Ari clearly states to make 7-8-11-13 with Huliot of 3, and when the Hachamim were talking about the Hida's method it means one by one in the 10-5-6-5 method. However, the popular Sephardic custom to me seems to be made up, and not have any source. <strong>Can someone give a source for this method of the 7-8-11-13 with the knots through them without the Huliot of 3?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This seems like multiple questions and I will suffice with addressing the first two:</p>\n\n<p>1) The mechaber clearly states (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=45\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 11:14</a>) that 40 wraps is for 39+1, 39 being the gematria of Hashem Echad and 1 for the name itself.

At what point does the satiation you got from that food dissipate? This case is where the Halacha says 72 minutes is your best guess for a small amount of bread.

On the other hand the mechon mamre clearly said that the unclean may eat thereof. I am always puzzled with inconsistency and hence the question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Short answer: <strong>No,</strong> Jews cannot eat non-Kosher (\"unclean\") animals.  Even kosher animals must be properly slaughtered and have all blood removed.</p>\n\n<p>Long answer: As mentioned above, context is very important.  Using an easy-to-understand translation and emphasizing <strong>all</strong> the key words is also important.  \"...the unclean and the clean <strong>may eat thereof</strong>...\"  \"May eat thereof\" are the important words.</p>\n\n<p>Here's that verse, in context in the New JPS translation (which should be easier to understand):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>10 When you cross the Jordan and settle in the land that the Lord your God is allotting to you, and He grants you safety from all your enemies around you and you live in security, 11 then you must bring everything that I command you to the site where the Lord your God will choose to establish His name: your burnt offerings and other sacrifices, your tithes and contributions, and all the choice votive offerings that you vow to the Lord. <strong>. . .</strong> 13 Take care not to sacrifice your burnt offerings in any place you like, 14 but only in the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribal territories. There you shall sacrifice your burnt offerings and there you shall observe all that I enjoin upon you. 15 But whenever you desire, you may slaughter and eat meat in any of your settlements, according to the blessing that the Lord your God has granted you. The unclean and the clean alike <strong>may partake of it</strong>, as of the gazelle and the deer. 16 But you must not partake of the blood; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, these verses are describing the offering of sacrifices and the consumption of meat.  Prior to the building of the Temple in Jerusalem, when an Israelite wanted to eat meat (which usually was only on special occasions), he would offer an animal as a sacrifice to God on his \"backyard alter,\" (במה\\במות) and partake of the remainder, thus including God in his meal.  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache%3aw9J03_EgqaoJ%3awww.tanach.org/vayikra/tzav.doc+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh1NZF2Ys6Je71tHBvAnIPMq4C8bFPG613X2LTg1vwzbVD46zxqvssoed6Jd00RDCYxiY6P6jsIvE0vkyHSiOLcJdPrVbxP4ym-vWibKwgmYDtIRNL2lwCnXt6EPm1bHQUJXcaU&sig=AHIEtbTHhYUzfhNZx5t2KyajupevuiIp5w&pli=1\">(Source.)</a>  These verses prohibit the use of \"backyard alters\" once the Temple has been built.  Since sacrifices are restricted to the Temple, if an Israelite wished to eat meat, he no longer has to offer it as a sacrifice.  <em>\"But whenever you desire, you may slaughter and eat meat...\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Only ritually \"clean\" or \"purified\" Jews who had immersed themselves in the <em>mikvah</em> were allowed in the Temple, whereas ritually impure individuals (such as one who came in contact with a dead body) were prohibited.  One might think that only ritually pure individuals would be allowed to eat meat.  Verse 15 teaches us that this is not so, \"the unclean and clean alike\" can eat from the meat.</p>\n\n<p>Why does the verse mention the gazelle and the deer?  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\">Rashi</a> <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976/showrashi/true\">explains</a> that they're mentioned to illustrate that the logical extension of the above holds true.  Gazelles and deer, while kosher, are not permitted as sacrifices in the Temple. But since the Israelite no longer has to offer the animal as a sacrifice before eating them, he is now permitted to slaughter and eat the gazelle and deer.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The above was the \"simple\" reading of the verses.  <em>Halakha,</em> or Jewish Law, reinterprets them slightly, due to the odd mentioning of the gazelle and deer, and the fact that this basic idea is repeated in verse 20.  The <em>halakah</em> explains that these verse refer to a specific case of an animal that was designated for a sacrifice and then became blemished.  For the details of this approach, please see Rashi's commentary on the verse, available in English <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976/showrashi/true\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The context of this pasuk is important.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the Torah, Moshe commands the Jewish people that none of the animals which are brought as sacrifices, may be killed, either in the camp or outside of it, without it ALSO being brought as a sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>This pasuk here, is telling the Jewish people, that just as they were allowed to kill and eat the Gazzelle and the \"Hart\" (really the antelope) without bringing it as a sacrifice. So to, when they cross over into Israel, they will not be required to bring a sacrifice unless they live close to the Mishkan (or later the beit hamikdash)</p>\n\n<p>The Gazzelle, and the \"hart\" are Kosher animals because they have split hooves, and chew their cud.</p>\n\n<p>However, the hebrew in this verse is \"Tameh\" and \"Tahor'.  This means that they are ritually \"clean\" or \"pure\" or not ritually \"clean/pure\".</p>\n\n<p>Only animals which are \"Tahor\" are allowed to be brought as a sacrifice, and so before this edict, only \"Tahor\" animals were allowed to be eaten at all.  But now, either \"Tahor\" or \"Tamei\" animals are allowed to be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>What makes an animal \"Tahor\" or \"Tamei\" are blemishes on the body. For example, a tear on the eye, or a chipped hoof.  This has nothing to do with Kashrut, or blood in the meat of the animals.</p>\n\n<p>So the short answer is \"No\".</p>\n\n\n",

Thus two branches of the sons of Keturah may be involved in Greece.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: “<a href=\"http://www.ccg.org/english/s/p212d.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Descendants of Abraham: Part IV: Sons of Keturah</a>”.

    "content": "# Fighting Wars on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I mentioned in another question, I was reading the Book of Maccabees over Shabbat (I and II).</p>\n<p>In the book of Maccabees, it mentions that early on in the struggle, there were a group of Jews hiding out in caves. The Greeks found them and were going to attack them on Shabbat.  The Jewish people in the caves, said they would not desecrate Shabbat no matter what, and all got killed.</p>\n<p>In response to this, Judah aka Macabeaus, makes a proclamation that it is ok to fight on Shabbat so that they do not all get killed in this manner.  Very reasonable.</p>\n<p>Centuries later, in the books by Josephus*, Josephus mentions that the Romans were building siege engines, and the Jews would throw down stones to stop the construction.  This foiled the Romans, until they started building the siege engines on Shabbat, and noticed that no stones came down on them.  Eventually, the Romans only built the siege engines on Shabbat, and the people in Jeruselem got sacked and killed and all sorts of bad things happened.  (This was years before the destruction of the temple btw.)  Again, a proclamation is made, and the Jews are allowed to fight the Romans on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Later in the Gemorah (Shabbat 19a) (Right before talking about chanukah ironically enough) it is stated that you may not siege a city 3 days before Shabbat.  Shamai however states, based on the passuk \"Until it is conqureed\" that you may siege a city even on Shabbat, until the city is completely taken. (Based on that verse in the Chumash).</p>\n<p>Does anyone know what is going on here?  Why did the people think they could not fight on Shabbat? Why, 300 years later, did they think so again, and why in the Gemora do they also make the assumption until Shamai says it's ok?  Also, why today is it so universally agreed upon that you can break Shabbat when serving in the Army even not during wartime. (If it's ordered/required by the Army to do so)?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quote from Josephus:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Jewish War\" page 40 (I, 156) (Herod's Predecessors)</p>\n<p>Pompey himself on the north side was busy filling in the trench and the\nentire ravine with material collected by the troops. This was a\nformidable task, as the depth was immense and the Jews interfered from\nabove in every possible way. The Romans would never have reached the\nend of their labors if Pompey had not availed himself of the seventh\nday, on which for religious reasons the Jews will not set their hand\nto any work, raising the level of his earthworks while keeping his men\nout of all armed clashes; for only in self-defense will Jews fight on\nthe Sabbath. When at last the ravine was filled in he erected high\ntowers on his artificial platform, brought up the engines he had\nfetched from Tyre, and began to batter teh walls while the stone\nthrowers prevented any interference from above.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>About the events described in Maccabees, R. Yitzchak Isaac Halevi offers the following explanation (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20128&pgnum=345\">Doros Harishonim 1:340ff</a>):</p>\n\n<p>These Jews hiding in the caves originally had no intention of waging war against the Greeks and their Jewish Hellenist allies, and no reason to think they'd be successful in doing so. But they figured that, while the Hellenists didn't want them to be able to observe mitzvos publicly, they wouldn't bother chasing after them into the deserts. When the Greek army did catch up with them on Shabbos, it was already too late to organize any kind of effective defense: at best they might have been able to take out a few Greek soldiers with them (in the spirit of Shimshon's \"let me die with the Philistines\"), but there was no natural possibility of saving their own lives - and so there was no overriding consideration to allow them to violate Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>When Yehudah Maccabee and his brothers heard about this, they realized that indeed the Greeks are not going to be satisfied with eradicating Judaism from the cities and towns; any practicing Jew anywhere in the land was in danger. Which meant, then, that it was time to start organizing themselves into fighting forces rather than just hiding. And then the halachos of warfare would apply, where defensive fighting is always permissible, and even offensives begun more than three days before Shabbos may be continued on that day (as per Shammai's statement - he lived long after these events, of course, but it is common for the Gemara to cite a teaching in the name of a later authority).</p>\n\n<p>About the events before the destruction of Jerusalem: can you cite a source in Josephus? Because I'm not finding it; on the contrary, in Wars 2:19:2 he describes how the Jews made a surprise attack against the forces of Cestius Gallus. (It may indeed be that part of the surprise was exactly that - that the Romans figured that the Jews wouldn't fight on Shabbos, not realizing the above distinction between a time of war and one of peace.)</p>\n\n\n",

And they brought Joseph into Egypt. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0137.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gen 37:26</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"they\" is ambiguous.  It could mean that the brothers had the Midianites do the deed for them -- earlier Reuven says \"let not our hand be on him\"; the implication is \"let's not kill him\" but maybe it's more general?  Or it could be that the Midianites came along while the brothers were eating and not paying attention, and their plans to do the deed were thrwarted?  Rashi's comment on this is just to say that this shows that Yosef was sold several times, which doesn't seem very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Did the Midianites act on their own (and collect the money) and the bothers weren't part of the transaction?

Then when Yosef passed the grave of his mother he escaped the caravan and ran to the grave and cried. The Yishmaelim then realized Yosef was special and didn’t want to be cursed so they sold him again to unmentioned group.\nDoes anyone know the answer?

In Copenhagen, one can hold a personal monthly ticket for unlimited travel with no payment for any service rendered specifically on Shabbos. Then there is the ticket system which holds problems like <em>muktzeh</em>, carrying, electric switches and sensors, etc. However, the pass consists of a non-electronic and non-electric card which is only visually inspected by humans. The card has a hole in the bottom left corner of the ID photo:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uOK3y.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uOK3y.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen monthly ticket\" /></a>\nThis can potentially be used to create a belt in the same fashion as Shabbos key belt:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xp2DZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Xp2DZ.jpg\" alt=\"Shabbos key belt\" /></a>\n<em>Amira l'akum</em> (instructing a gentile to do a forbidden action) could be an issue if telling the driver to stop or go for you, but the trains are fully automatic (like Shabbos elevators) and stop at every station. Another potential problem is opening the train doors (electronic switches again), but all metro doors open automatically at stations:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oXhEV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oXhEV.jpg\" alt=\"metro station with train\" /></a>\nTriggering various sensors when entering and leaving could be a show-stopper, but the stations have neither turnstiles nor entrance doors (there is open air access to the platform), only platform doors which open when the trains' doors open:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZycHx.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZycHx.jpg\" alt=\"station layout\" /></a>\nFurthermore, there is the issue of <em>t'chum</em> (maximum allowed travel distance from the town), but there is never more than 1½ kilometer between stations and anyway the lines only pass through densely populated areas:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MisJS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MisJS.jpg\" alt=\"map with scale\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, to answer your questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is the subway like a shabbat elevator, or are there other issues that\nwould prevent one from riding it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are other issues as well, each addressed above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is the underground network of tunnels a Reshut haYachid or Reshut\nhaRabim, and since it's underground, would it be considered enclosed\nby an eruv or not?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the case of the Copenhagen Metro, this is irrelevant as no carrying is needed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, can this be generalized to all mass-transit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, as stated, these particular conditions only apply to the Copenhagen Metro – not even to the other modes of transit in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>It would seem that most potential problems on Shabbos are non-issues for the Copenhagen Metro, but that being said, using transit on Shabbos is definitely not <em>Shabbosdik</em> (appropriate for or in the spirit of Shabbos) and may cause onlookers to believe that other transit (even in Copenhagen) is permitted on Shabbos.

    "content": "# Was the world created with din or with rachamim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember Chazal saying somewhere that the world could not survive, had it been created with din/harsh judgement/strictness. However, in Bereshis, at the very beginning, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא <strong>אֱ־לֹהִים</strong> אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So how was it created? By <em>Elokim</em> (ie <em>din</em>) or by <em>Hashem</em> (ie <em>rachamim</em>)? I've read the Rashi here, but I'm not sure what exactly it means by saying that it was G-d's intention to create the world with <em>din</em>, but then He decided otherwise, as it were. If this was so, it would make sense to have a remes in the text alluding to it, but this is straight p'shat, it looks like the world <em>was, in fact</em> created with din in mind. </p>\n\n<p>Can someone clarify this for me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi (in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7990/jewish/Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tanya, Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah ch. 4</a>) explains that the name Elokim \"shields\" the name Havayah, and makes it possible for finite and (seemingly) independent creatures to exist in the first place. Thus, Elokim represents (and is the source of) the <em>tzimtzum</em>, the \"contraction\" of Divine energy that made \"room\" for the various spiritual worlds and our physical one.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7991/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch. 5</a> he then goes on to relate this to the Midrash that you quoted. An excerpt from the commentary there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order for created beings to believe that they possess independent existence there must be the process of <em>tzimtzum</em>, which is an expression of the stern attribute of <em>Gevurah</em>. Without it, all of creation would be completely nullified within its source.</p>\n<p>G‑d, however, desired that created beings maintain that they possess independent existence, in order for them to be able to serve Him and ultimately be rewarded for their service. Thus, it is specifically <em>Gevurah</em> and <em>tzimtzum</em> that enable them to realize the ultimate purpose of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So basically, that state of affairs still exists: our world fundamentally gets its energy through the Name Elokim. The \"joining\" of the Name Havayah to this, R. Schneur Zalman goes on to say, is the fact that our world is capable of being the stage for G-d's miracles. (This distinction between Elokim and Havayah seems to reflect the distinction drawn by Abarbanel, in jake's answer.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Abarbanel (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=71&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 1</a>) quotes this midrash and gives his interpretation (with my own translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל ענין דבריהם אצלי הוא שאלהים הוא מדת הדין ורצה לומר שרצה הקב״ה לברא העולם במדת הדין הגוזרת שכן יהיה תמיד כמו שנברא ולא ישתנה בשום צד כי זה היה דינו הראוי לו כפי קיום הפועל יתברך וכן אמרו פעמים רבות מדת הדין על המנהג הטבעי המתמיד כפי סדרו. אמנם מדת רחמים יאמרו על שנוי הטבעים ומעשה הפלאות בבטול המנהג הטבעי אשר יעשה השם ברחמיו על עמו ועל חסידיו. והנה מאמרם ז״ל שרצה הקב״ה לברא את העולם במדת הדין שיתמיד כמו שנברא ולא ישתנה דבר מהטבע שסדר בו. אבל לפי שראה שאינו מתקיים בכך כי לפעמים יצטרך לברא חדשה בארץ בשנוי הטבע סביב ליראיו ויחלצם לכך שתף בה מדת רחמים והוא במה שהתנה במעשה בראשית לשנותם בעת הצורך ושעליו נאמר ביום עשות ה׳ אלהים ארץ ושמים הנה בראם על מנת לשנותם כשיצטרכו אליו חסידיו ובזה ינהג אליו מנהג הדין תמיד ויפעל מדת הרחמים בעת הצורך</p>\n<p>However, my understanding of their [Chazal's] words is that \"Elokim\" represents the attribute of \"<em>din</em>\", meaning that the Holy One wished to create the world with this attribute of <em>din</em> which rules that the universe should remain constantly the way it was created, without changing in any way, for this is its proper <em>din</em> [i.e. \"nature\"] with which to be upkept by its Blessed creator. And in fact, many times they [Chazal] used the term \"<em>midat hadin</em>\" to mean the \"natural order\" that continues according to the way it was set up. \"<em>Midat Rachamim</em>\", though, is how they referred to the changing of nature, the supernatural, breaking the laws of nature, which God does in His compassion toward His people and His devoted ones. Thus, their statement is that God wanted to create the world with <em>midat hadin</em>, so that it continue as it was created, without any alteration to its natural laws. But, since he saw that it would not survive like this, for certain times call for novel creations and violations of nature 'surrounding those who fear Him to deliver their safety', therefore he combined with this the <em>midat harachamim</em>, in that he stipulated in the creation to be able to change it when needed. And referring to this, it says, \"On the day that Hashem Elokim made the Earth and the Heavens\" (Bereshis 2:4); He created them with the stipulation that He may change them whenever His devoted ones are in need. And thus, He leads the universe with <em>midat hadin</em> regularly, and employs <em>midat harachamim</em> when it is necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Bereishis Rabbah Perek 12, brings an analogy (that I have paraphrased),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>of a King who had fragile cups. He said: \"If I fill them with hot water, they will crack. But if I fill them with cold water, it will congeal(?)\". So what did he do? He mixed the cold water with the hot water and filled the cups.</p>\n<p>The same with Hashem, He saw that if he created the world with midas harachamim, there would be no deterrent to sin. If He created it with midas hadin, it wouldn't survive (I suppose the world would have been destroyed many times over, for its sins). So He mixed them together and created the world with both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, G-d created the world with both, and therefore Torah used both names of G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, the\n  explanation of the verses \"ועשו להם ציצית על כנפי בגדיהם\" and \"גדילים\n  תעשה לך על ארבע כנפות כסותך\" is that if a man wants to wear and cover\n  himself with a garment of four corners, he must make tzitzit on it.\n  And if he wears it without making tzitzit on it he has violated a\n  positive commandment and will be punished. But if he has a garment of\n  four corners but it is sitting in a box, he is not obligated to make\n  tzitzit on it unless he wears it. This is what we meant by\n  \"tzitzit is an obligation of the person\". (Gloss: See earlier 19:1.)\n  But if a man wishes to make all of his clothes in such a way that they\n  will not have four corners and cover [himself] with them, he is\n  allowed to do so. And in this manner he can exempt himself from the\n  commandment of tzitzit even for his entire life, except that he will\n  lose out the reward in the world-to-come that he would have received\n  if he had worn tzitzit which has five terminologies of positive\n  commandment, and they are:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>ועשו להם ציצית</li>\n  <li>ונתנו על ציצית הכנף</li>\n  <li>וראיתם אותו </li>\n  <li>והיה לכם לציצית </li>\n  <li>גדילים תעשה לך</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Therefore it is good and proper and incumbent on every man to fulfill\n  the the commandment of tzitzit, meaning to say that he should acquire\n  a garment of four corners and make tzitzit on it and wear it every day\n  for the sake of the commandment, and he will receive reward for\n  fulfilling the five positive commandments that we mentioned. He should\n  be careful and punctilious to have a small garment with tzitzit that\n  he wears the entire day in order to remember all the commandments at\n  all times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=46&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 24:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טוב ונכון להיות כל אדם זהיר במצוה זו ללבוש טלית קטן כל היום כדי שיזכור\n  המצות בכל רגע</p>\n  \n  <p>It is good and proper for every man to be careful in this commandment,\n  to wear a small garment the entire day in order to remember the\n  commandments at every moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Very, very strong custom and halachic preference. Gemara says someone who wheedles his way out of a mitzva (e.g. by actively rounding the corners of his garment) is someone who, when Hashem gets angry, well watch out. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12072/21\">More here</a>. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/195/21\">And specifically about tzitzis, here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It's such an easy mitzva to do that why avoid it? Standard Jewish practice has become long ago to give ourselves the opportunity for one more mitzva.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly before his death the Vilna Gaon cried that a mitzva like tzitzis only takes a couple of kopeks (well dollars today), but once we pass on there are no more chances to do mitzvahs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think the logic is \"if you can, then why not?\" I don't see why anyone today shouldn't wear it. If you are embarrassed then there is Deot that say you can tuck it in (although Lechatehila, according to Sephardadim and Ashkenazim they should be exposed). If it is dangerous tuck them in. If you playing sports, you certainly can remove them. Why not do a mitzva if possible? I heard in the name of the Alshich HaQadosh that once someone puts on the Talit they are performing 613 Miswot. So why not wear Tzitzit? If you can, the Yalkut Yosef says (siman 8 I believe) that if one can and he doesn't there is a big Onesh involved. So just do it. It is also a protection, as we learned in Masechet Shabbat. There are many benefits in wearing Tzitzit. </p>\n\n\n",

What is less well known is that Chanukah also highlights a delicate interplay between conflicting emotions, attitudes and intentions that that are expressed both in interpersonal relationships and in one's relationship with God. The pathway to unlocking Chanukah's hidden message leads us through the Torah portion Vayeshev, which is typically read on or immediately before the holiday of Chanukah.<br />\n...<br />\nA parallel can now begin to be drawn to Chanukah. The assault of Antiochus on the Temple is viewed by many as being the outward manifestation of a more insidious invasion -- that of Hellenistic ideals into the minds of practicing Jews. Faith and belief were replaced by empirical rationalism. The pursuit of physical pleasure no longer served as an instrument of spiritual health; it became an end unto itself. The concept of God was both splintered and reduced from a unique, transcendent Being, to a pantheon, decidedly human in character. By the time Antiochus defiled the Temple, Jewish sensibilities had themselves degraded and lost their clarity.<br />\n...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is only a snippet of the <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/c/t/dt/48953811.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

And if so, when and why did it change?</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Since this is an issue where many people feel very connected to their received pronunciation, a clear online source that anyone can read is highly recommended.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Josephus transliterates the name as <a href=\"http://www.loebclassics.com/view/josephus-jewish_antiquities/1930/pb_LCL365.137.xml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ἀσαμωναίος</a>. The transliterated form ω corresponds to long o (see Brønno, \"Some nominal types in the Septuagint\" in <em>Classica et Mediaevalia</em> 3 and <em>Studien über Hebräische Morphologie und Vokalismus auf Grundlage der Mercatischen Fragmente der zweiten Kolumne der Hexapla des Origines</em>). For example, יוֹנָתָן is transliterated as Ἰωνάθην. It would appear, therefore, that Josephus used the form commonly used today. Though it would be worthwhile to read Adolf Schlatter's <em>Die hebräischen Namen bei Josephus</em> on reconstructing original names in Hebrew from Josephus' Greek, I do not have access to this work.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, old mss agree with u in the name.

Against these vocalizations, <a href=\"http://cal.huc.edu/searching/targumsearch.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Targum Yerushalmi</a> to 1 Sam. 2:4 has the form חַשמַנַאי, with a patah. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, many (but not all) early mss attest to the form with shuruq. Perhaps multiple traditions for the pronunciation exist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>\"Chashmunai\" is the spelling in the old siddurim i.e. the siddurim in manuscript (see the research in 'Azor Eliyahu').\nIt was changed to Chashmonai about 200 years ago.\nWhether the name Chashmun is the name of the grandfather or of the whole family is disputed.</p>\n<p>Re: \"Chashmonay\" vs. \"Chashmona'i\"-\nModern ivrit uses \"...a'i\" everywhere, such as Chashmona'i, barka'i... rather than the old barkay, based on the assumption that there are two nekudot- patach and chirik.

    "content": "# How to tell someone about Shomer Negiah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I'm sure that many of you have had to \"break it\" to a coworker or friend that you're Shomer Negiah, have you found a strategy or choice of words that seems most effective? As I wasn't raised frum and only adopted Shomer Negiah over a year ago, it's still kind of awkward to tell people, as I assume they're thinking I'm crazy or weird.</p>\n\n<p>I usually start out with, \"I'm sorry, I don't have physical contact with women other than my wife\" and then usually end up blabbing on about why I do it and that it in no way is indicative of male chauvinism, etc. and I usually feel pretty much like a fool at the end of it. </p>\n\n<p>I'm flying out to work onsite with a company which I was just hired to. I have the ability at present to simply send an email to all  of the women on the team addressing the subject to diminish the potential awkwardness when I'm there. How should I address this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>This is awkward, particularly if you have behaved differently in the past (so people who knew you then will be confused by the change).</p>\n\n<p>I would not send pre-emptive email; I don't think it will reduce the face-to-face confusion and it risks seeming to make a mountain out of a mole-hill.  You're also going to be leaving early on Fridays, not eating the random food that shows up in the kitchen, not joining the company's co-ed swim team (ok, I'm reaching), and so on, but you wouldn't alert all your coworkers to the reasons for those, probably.  (You would discuss the Friday thing with your management, of course.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I would deal with it, once per person as needed, face-to-face, starting with \"sorry, I can't\", and if that's questioned, \"for religious reasons I avoid physical contact with women other than my wife\", and only going farther if specifically asked.  Your co-workers want a good working relationship too; probably they won't ask, and if they do you can explain it to whatever degree seems to match the exhibited curiosity.  But you don't need to share too much up front, which could actually make people more rather than less uncomfortable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Keep it very simple: \"I don't shake hands with women for religious reasons\"</p>\n\n<p>I don't think an email is necessary.  </p>\n\n<p>Most people only shake hands for one of two reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to introduce</li>\n<li>to seal a deal/agreement</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you're making a deal with these people, then they will need to know when you meet them that cross-gender handshaking is not on the agenda.</p>\n\n<p>If you're simply working with them, it might be better just to avoid the initial handshake entirely.  (Book / folder in hands, head nod)  That way, you don't have to say anything at all, and after that first introduction, it won't come up again.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you could just shake the women's hands.<br>\n[see (Igros Moshe, Even Haezer, Vol. I, 56) - and Rambam  Hilchos Issurei Biah 16 21:1]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I would read the <a href=\"http://tippingresearch.com/uploads/Reachout.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">following research paper regarding</a> the effects of touching people.</p>\n\n<p>If you feel awkward about saying that it's a religious requirement and leave it at that, then you might want to try to use the findings of the research to explain to people that you do not wish to bias their opinions of you by giving subconscious feelings of connection, which aren't relayed by your words alone.</p>\n\n<p>If fear of sexism is the main problem, then in a work environment you might want to avoid touching people all together.</p>\n\n<p>You can always use the research paper as a means to tell people that you respect them too much to try to persuade them via touching.</p>\n\n<p>There are other research papers which talk about the effects of touching people and how it influences both attitudes and behavior.</p>\n\n<p>It's a good era to keep halachot, where they can be explained without using religious language if need be.</p>\n\n\n",

So this forced them into alternative explanations, such as \"you will father seven daughters\" - from one of your wives - \"and [at the same time] bury seven others\" born from a different wife.</p>\n\n<p>Yosef's insight, then, was that indeed the two could coexist. If the surplus from the good years is stored away for the famine, as he suggested (thus also incidentally answering the question of how he dared to advise Pharaoh when he hadn't been called to do so), then throughout the first seven years, the upcoming famine will be very much present in everyone's minds. Conversely, during the seven years of famine, the years of plenty will still be present - in the form of the grain that they produced.</p>\n\n<p>(It's interesting, though, that in Pharaoh's retelling of the dream to Yosef, he just says that the skinny cows \"came up after them\" (41:19), without mentioning that crucial detail that all fourteen of them stood together for a while. If he also omitted this detail when talking to the magicians, then that still begs for the explanation of why they needed to account for it, and why Pharaoh didn't find their answers convincing.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>One simple answer from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=529\" rel=\"nofollow\">Targum Yonasan ben Uziel</a> - Hashem did not want them to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Many mefarshim say that the Egyptian chachamim messed up because they did not understand that they were the same dream.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, see Seforno (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=529\" rel=\"nofollow\">41:8</a>) who indicates that were trying to relate the dreams to one another through cause (the cow dream) and potential effect (the grain dream).  The basic dream was planting (though plowing) + water (the yeor) = food (the grain).  As a guess, the interpretation could have been: good prep equals good food, bad prep equals bad food, so make.</p>\n\n\n",

All the more so here, since fear of Hashem is the one thing that Hashem leaves out of His control anyway (הכל בידי שמים חוץ מיראת שמים, Berachos 33b). So the שוב אינו חוטא may simply describe a likelihood rather than an ironclad guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>(There is also this point worth noting: in Kiddushin 66a, where the story of Yochanan's* becoming a Tzeduki is recorded, it mentions that one of the guests at that fateful party was \"a scoffer, with an evil heart, a wicked man, named Elazar ben Po'era\" - and he's the one who precipitated the crisis with his advice. We may well ask, then: what is such a character doing in Yochanan's inner circle anyway? That may well indicate that indeed a certain rot had set in long before.)</p>\n\n\n",

A breakthrough in its restoration occurred with the remarkable discovery by Ofeq Institute of a manuscript of an earlier version in the form of a dialogue, in the author's own hand. With this discovery and the aid of the first edition, Mesillat Yesharim was restored to its original state.</p>\n<p>Over the last decade, Ofeq Institute has published both versions of Mesillat Yesharim, the Dialogue and the Thematic, in twin editions.

These shed light on the profound nature of the work as a whole.

Aviner's answer, is that he does not cite a source which says that touching through a glove and clothing is actually an issur, but just says to stay away from women in general.</p>\n<p>This seems to me to fall under the category of \"not shabbostik\", but instead of referring to shabbos, referring to shomer nagiah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Tosfos in Sotah 19a (D'H V'kohen Maniach) quoting the Yerushalmi, asks how was it permissible for the Kohen to place his hands underneath the Sotah's hands while doing \"tenufa\" ie. waving the offering, when bringing the Minchas Sotah?</p>\n\n<p>One answer Tosfos suggests to justify this is because the Kohen placed a sheet or napkin between his hands and her hands. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וכהן מניח את ידו תחתיה.</strong> האי דאיצטריך תו למיתני וכהן מניח את ידו תחתיה ולא קתני בסתם ומכניס את ידו לאשמועינן דתנופה בכהן <strong>ירושלמי וכהן מניח את ידו תחתיה ואין הדבר כיעור מניח מפה ואינו חוצץ</strong> מביא כהן זקן ואפילו תימא כהן ילד שאין יצר הרע מצויה לשעה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Munkatcher Rebbe in his notes on the Yerushalmi says that this is the source of the practice of the very righteous, who would place a sheet on the head of the woman asking for a blessing when placing their hands on her head to bless them. However, this can only be relied upon by someone exceedingly righteous.</p>\n\n<p>Basing himself on the above, the Shearim Metzuyanim Behalacha (חלק ד קמז-ו) permits a man to help his wife up who may have fallen on ice or snow by pulling her up from her garment, despite her being in Niddah and thus prohibited to touch, as it is not direct skin on skin contact. Certainly one could also use gloves accomplish this as well.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, says the SMB'H that the minhag among G-d fearing Jews is to refrain from contact even where it is not skin on skin contact, as even that answer of Tosfos quoted above is one of three different answers which indicates that it is not the definitive answer, and can only be applied practically in extenuating circumstances.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>One may not draw any halachic conclusions from this answer.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is a relatively well known story about the Sanz-Klausenberger Rebbe zy\"a: After the Holocaust the Rebbe remained in the Displaced Persons camps. On erev Yom Kippur a young woman came to him, very upset that, having lost her father she did not have anyone to give her a blessing (while in many places the blessing is given to children every Friday, among many chassidim it is reserved for extra special occasions such as erev Yom Kippur).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.levlalev.com/site/PageServer?pagename=HistoryoftheHome\">\"He turned to her lovingly and said “don’t cry, my child, I will be your Father and bless you this Yom Kippur! With tears streaming down his face, the Rebbe proceeded to place his hands atop a scarf upon the head of the girl and gave her a most heartfelt and sincere blessing for the coming New Year, in memory of the holy souls who had perished in the Holocaust. After the girl dried her own tears and thanked the Rebbe, she went back to her room and whispered her good fortune to her friends. In turn, they lined up to receive their own blessing and the Rebbe calmly blessed every girl who came to him that Yom Kippur Eve.\"</a></p>\n\n<p>This of course is an exceptional circumstance that I don't think most people would be inclined to infer far reaching halachic conclusions from. We can find a number of sources which would provide room for leniency in this situation, the scarf only providing an additional level of tznius.</p>\n\n<p>In more typical circumstances I think the admonition of the Sefer Chassidim 1090 (See Rabbi Getsel Ellinson Woman & the Mitzvot vol. 2, page 73) which prohibits touching (i.e. shaking hands) with a [non-Jewish] woman even when gloved would be more apropos. </p>\n\n\n",

If the host specifically offers the food, then the guest may not eat off the dishes because of Lifnei Iver. However by a restaurant, he says that one may not be lenient because of commercial use.

The first Source for its recitation is Maseches Sofrim <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12880/what-is-the-provenance-of-maseches-sofrim\">(see article about its own author)</a> Ch.20 Pr.36 in the Hager Edition. (This is apparently the version that was available to the earlier Poskim.) I quote the Maseches Sofrim, </p>\n\n<p><strong>“On the 25th of Kislev, we light the Chanuka candles…. What Bracha do we recite? On the first day, the one who lights recites three Brachos: ‘Blessed are you … who commanded us to light the Chanukah candle’. He (the lighter) pauses and then stipulates: ‘These candles we light for the salvations for the miracles and for the wonders that you performed for our forefathers through your holy Kohanim, and for all eight days of Chanuka, these candsles are sacred. We are not permitted to use them, only to see them in order to give thanks to your name for your wonders, for your miracles, and for your salvations’. He then recites: ‘Blessed are you … who has kept us alive… [shehechiyanu ]’and ‘Blessed are you … who performs miracles [sheasah nissim] ’. ”</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although this source appears so early, the first Rishon to bring it down is Maharam of Rottenburg (Teshuvos, Prague edition vol.4, sec.66). It is also mentioned by Rabbeinu Yeruchem (Toldois Adam Vachavah, Path 9, vol. 1, p.60a, col 2) and is codified by the Tur and Shulchan Aruch  (Orach Chaim 676:4). It is interesting to note that one of the greatest early achronim, Rav Shaul ben Rav Dovid, a contemporary of the Maharsha composed an entire sefer on the topic of Haneiros Halolu, and on the halachos that can be derived from it. (Other references where this passage is quoted are TashBetz Katon sec.576), Abudraham (Chanukah) and the Sefer Hagahos HaMinhagim (Chanukah, par.22, authored in the days of the Rishonim).</p>\n\n<p>A massive controversy exists based on the text of the Maseches Sofrim. The passage implies that straight after the first Brachah one recites this recital, and only then continues to the other Brachas. This causes the poskim a great deal of difficulty resolving the problem how this is not considered ti be a Hefsek. </p>\n\n<p>The first source to ask this point outright is the Maharil (Teshuvos sec.145). The Maharil answers that the reason we do not hold like the Masches Sofrim is because we hold like the Bavli that says a Bracha must be done straight before a mitzvah. However the Sofrim holds like the Yerushalmi that doesn’t require blessings to be recited immediately before and therefore permits it. (This goes extremely wel with the Ramban’s statement that the Sofrim is really a part of the Yerushalmi <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12880/what-is-the-provenance-of-maseches-sofrim\">(brought down in this afore mentioned article)</a>. A novel answer by the Leket Yosher(vol 1, Orach Chaim p.152 inyan 1) is that this ending of the Brachos at the end of the paragraph of the Sofrim, is actually just part of the recital of the Haneiros Halalu and not really the brochos. This is supported by the fact that it brings the Shehechiyanu Brachah first when it should really be last. The practice followed nowadays to start its recital after lighting the first candle I brought down in Shu’t Mahashal (sec.85), and is supported by all major achronim (see Magen Avrohom ibid  sec.676 subpar.3).</p>\n\n<p>A last Mesorah brought down, is by the Maharshal (Shu’t Maharshal sec.85) is that one should not add nor subtract words from the text because the number of words in the passage is 36 which allude to the number of candles lit altogether on Chanukah without the Shamash!</p>\n\n<p>I hope I have helped, and if you need more references on this topic, feel free to check the latest Kulmos in the Mishpacha which is where I got a lot of this info or you can just ask me!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How Is It That Rabbis Have Copies of Their Own Responsa?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(I could use some help with tagging.)</p>\n\n<p>There are many seforim out there that are the compiled letters or teshuvos of this or that Rabbi. Those that come to mind are \"Igros Moshe\", from R' Moshe Feinstein, and \"Igros Kodesh\" from the Lubavitcher Rebbeim.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, since all of those letters are responses to people, they were presumably mailed out to their intended recipients. So where did/do the compilers get them? Do they go around to all the people who have letters and ask them for copies? Were the originals typed in triplicate?</p>\n\n<p>I know that Rabbi Dr. Nissan Mindel, who was one of the Lubavitcher Rebbe's secretaries (shamoshim), had a collection of (English) letters that (I assume) he typed out for the Rebbe. <strong>(Edit - After consulting with the current owner of those letters, I was told that @msh210 was correct. Rabbi Dr. Mindel would take dictation in shorthand and then type up the letters in duplicate.)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Did these Rabbis keep personal copies of all their responses?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>So many great answers so I accepted the one that helped me the most. Upvoted all of them, though.</h2>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>My understanding (no source) is that, yes, twentieth-century rabbis kept copies. It wasn't necessary to type twice: they used <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_paper\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">carbon paper</a>. I don't know about older rabbis, though.</p>\n\n<p><em>Update:</em> However, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12551/how-is-it-that-rabbis-have-copies-of-their-own-responsa/12552#comment59265_12552\">the comments on this answer</a>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>I think that by the Lubavitcher Rebbe the secretaries used to make a rough draft, send it in to the Rebbe for proofreading, get the Rebbe to write notes on it, retype the letter and send it. Therefore, the secretaries had the original copy in manuscript.</p>\n\n<p>Later, when the Rebbe stopped writing full letters, He used to respond in Ksav Yad on the margins of the letters sent it. I think the secretaries kept the original ksav yad, and sent the retyped response.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the older Igros (from the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbes) are (AFAIK) from people (they ask for people with letters to send them to Kehos).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>In the days before copy machines and email it was certainly a common process among many letter writers Jewish and non-Jewish alike to write out copies of their own letters that they were sending. Not everybody did it but it was quite common. You can therefore find collections of letters sent by many people famous and not famous in historical collections. The letters of George Washington or John Adams for example. It should not be surprising that many Rabbeim kept copies of there own letters, particularly significant letters such as responsa.</p>\n\n\n",

Auerbach who's opinions on this vary greatly.</p>\n\n<h2>Igniting a fire</h2>\n\n<p>The basic example of using electricity, (turning on an incandescent light switch) violates the Torah prohibition of lighting a fire on shabbat. (the metal glows, and gets hot) However, even though this was the first application of electricity, and it's the most common, and clearly not allowed, it is not a catch all reason for all uses of electricity.</p>\n\n<h2>Molid</h2>\n\n<p>Many want to say that using electricity creates situations of Molid (creating something new) However, R. Auerbach says that you can't expand Molid beyond its usage as defined by the Talmud.</p>\n\n<h2>Boneh</h2>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish says that closing a circuit to create current falls under the deoraita of Boneh. Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach disagreed in the strongest terms. The reasons for this require an indepth understanding of Boneh.</p>\n\n<h2>Makeh Bapatish</h2>\n\n<p>Some try to argue that turning on or off an electrical appliance, or just using a button on it, is the \"final step\" that finishes the the item. R. Auerbach greatly dissagreed with this.</p>\n\n<h2>Sparks</h2>\n\n<p>If the electrical device always and purposefully creates sparks, (like my radiator for example) the creation of sparks might be a problem.</p>\n\n<h2>Additional fuel consumption</h2>\n\n<p>In Israel, or places where power plants are run/owned by Jews, the use of electricity might cause these power plants to consume more fuel.</p>\n\n<h2>Heating metal</h2>\n\n<p>Electricity entering into a wire might heat that wire (according to the Chazon Ish). However, in recent years the prevalence of solid-state technology has made the reality underlying this concern obsolete in many cases.</p>\n\n<h2>Minhag</h2>\n\n<p>Rabbi Auerbach says that outside the case of an incandescent light bulb, the true reason not to use electricity on shabbat/yom tov is minhag.</p>\n\n<h2>Not Shabastik/ In the spirit of Shabbat / yom tov.</h2>\n\n<p>Many say that while electricity in most cases might actually be allowed, it's not in the mood of shabbos and is a \"davar chol\", something that is normally done during the week. Especially after the past 80 years of Jews not using electricity on Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The most comprehensive and scholarly discussion I've found is \"The Use Of Electricity On Shabbat And Yom Tov\" by Rabbi Broyde - Adjunct Assistant Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School, Rabbi Jachter - Associate Rabbi of Congregation Beth Judah in Brooklyn,\nJournal of Halacha & Contemporary Society, No. XXI - Spring 91 - Pesach 5751.<br />\nIt is fully annotated.</p>\n<p>Here's the link:\n<a href=\"https://daat.ac.il/daat/english/Journal/broyde_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://daat.ac.il/daat/english/Journal/broyde_1.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hillel Zacks at a Shuir Pesicha on Maseches Shabbos wanted to prove that it is prohibited as \"Meleches Tofer\".</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>רב הלל בשיעור פתיחה בישיבה למסכת שבת: אמר שגדולי ישראל שבכל הדורות שקדו על תקנת ישראל שלא יעברו איסורים, וכשהתחדש החשמל רצו למנוע את ישראל מלעבור על איסור ולהדליק חשמל בשבת, אבל לא מצאו מדין איזה מלאכה בעצם זה אסור. אז בהתחלה אמרו שזה מבעיר, אח\"כ התחדשו הפלורליסטים שזה כבר לא מבעיר ולא ידעו מאיזה דין לאסור, עד שבא החזו\"א ואמר שזה משום בונה ואף אחד לא מבין אז אי אפשר להתווכח. היה עוד אחד (י\"א שהכוונה על עצמו) אחרי זה שרצה לטעון שזה בכלל תופר... עד כאן דבריו.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

This was the case until our patriarch <em>Yaakov</em> begged for mercy regarding this, saying to God, \"Master of all worlds, don't take my soul from me until I've given my [final] instructions to my children and household\". God accepted his entreaty, as it says [<em>B'reshis</em> 48:1] \"It was after these things that someone told <em>Yosef</em>, 'lo, your father is sick'\", and all the peoples heard of this and wondered, as there had been nothing like it since the day heaven and earth had been created.

Samuel arrived just as Saul finished offering his sacrifices and reprimanded Saul for not obeying his instructions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Saul was Israel's first king. He <em>thought</em> his mandate was larger than it was. The above examples (Agag and battle preparations) show that he didn't realize his real role: that of \"Chief Operating Officer/Chief Military Officer.\" The real \"CEO\" for the Israelites was Gd, as represented by his prophet.

In his introduction (to Yeshayahu) he writes the assumptions with which he operates in his commentary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>:עמודי התוך אשר הפירוש נשען עליהם הם שלשה</p>\n<p>א) לא נמצא במליצות הנביאים כפל ענין במלות שונות, לא כפל ענין, לא כפל מאמר, ולא כפל מליצה, לא שני משפטים שענינם אחד, לא שני משלים שהנמשל אחד, ואף לא שני מלות כפולות</p>\n<p>ב)  לא נמצאו במליצות הנביאים ובמאמריהם הפשוטים או הכפולים, מלות או פעלים הונחו במקרה מבלתי כונה מיוחדת, על שכל המלות והשמות והפעלים שמהם הורכב כל מאמר, לא לבד שהם מוכרחים לבא במאמר ההוא, כי גם לא היה אפשר להמליץ האלהי להניח תחתיהם מלה אחרת,כי כל מלות המליצה האלהית שקולה במאזני החכמה והדעת, ערוכים ושמורים מנוים וספורים במדת החכמה העליונה, אשר אך היא לבדה תשגיב בכחה לדבר כן</p>\n<p>ג) לא נמצא במליצות הנביאים קליפה בלא תוך גויה בלא נשמה, לבוש בלא מתלבש, מאמר רק  מרעיון נשגב, דבור לא תשכון תבונה בו, כי  דברות אלהים חיים כולם אל חי בקרבם, רוח חיים באפם רוח איום אביר אדיר ונורא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize in English:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1)</strong> There are no two phrases or even two words that mean exactly the same thing. There is no such thing as \"repetition of the same idea with different wording\".</li>\n<li><strong>2)</strong> All words and phrases in Tanach are necessary. Not only would the idea that the author is trying to get across be deficient without the specific phrase he uses, but also that no other phrase with different wording could take its place and convey the same idea.</li>\n<li><strong>3)</strong> No phrase, verse, or section in Tanach is pointless. Everything that is written has profound meaning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyone who had read part of Malbim's commentary can see how these \"axioms\" are incorporated. What has always bothered me, though, is that Malbim seems to be saying with (1) and (2) that Tanach is devoid of poetic style. The author did not have a choice with his wording, but rather used the only phrasology available to convey the exact point he was trying to make. Not only is this uncomfortable for me to accept, but it also seems to be in direct opposition to the multitude of Rishonim that wrote commentaries on Tanach.</p>\n<p><strong>Radak</strong> seems to be especially fond of saying that certain wordings are \"כפל ענין במלות שונות\" - \"repetition of the same idea with a different wording.\"<br />\n<strong>Ibn Kaspi</strong> is especially well-known for saying that the way the Torah writes many things is a matter of style, and that anyone who tries to learn things from the fact that the Torah wrote something one way and not another way is attributing meaning to something that has none. Now, perhaps Ibn Kaspi is an extreme example, but I cannot find a single Rishon that would agree with Malbim's axioms (1) and (2).</p>\n<p>Now, I have thought of several options to explain this phenomenon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Malbim is an innovator.</strong> He effectively rejects the approach of all those that came before him to introduce a completely novel approach to Tanach. The problem with this is that in general, the religious Jewish community is not fond of commentaries with approaches that are \"too novel\". I have often heard that certain newer commentaries should not be learned because they strayed from the path of the earlier commentaries in their approach. Malbim, however, is so popular, that it is difficult to find a set of Mikraot Gedolot on Nach that does not include his commentary.</li>\n<li><strong>Malbim is not a p'shat commentary.</strong> Being that most of the Rishonim under question were of the p'shat approach, the earlier discussion would not pose a problem. Also, this can be seen by the fact that one of Malbim's main tasks is to justify Chazal's midrashim based on the text, especially the midrash halacha, which seems to be his entire commentary to Shemos through Devarim. And midrash halacha has, for the most part, already been identified as part of the d'rash approach, in opposition to p'shat, by such commentators as Ramban and Ibn Ezra.</li>\n<li><strong>Malbim himself didn't really believe what he wrote.</strong> Historically, Malbim had a lot of trouble with the reform movement. Perhaps he wrote this commentary in opposition to the <em>maskil</em> philosophy, which perhaps emphasized the poetic nature of Tanach over its technical nature (that is, the messages being conveyed in the text). Perhaps, even though Malbim agreed with the earlier approach of the Rishonim, he wrote his commentary stressing the other extreme particularly for his time and place. (Generally, I don't like saying these types of explanations.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I apologize for writing such a long question, but my question, succinctly, is:</p>\n<p><strong>How do you explain the Malbim's deviation from earlier commentators in light of his unbelievable popularity in the modern religious community?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>To summarize (and perhaps embellish) <a href=\"http://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/Elman-Yaakov\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Yaakov Elman</a>'s <em><a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JS/JSIJ/2-2003/Elman.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Rebirth of Omnisignificant Biblical Exegesis in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries</a></em>, which addresses all this at length, <em>Hazal</em> seemed to assume that every word in the Torah was deliberate, meaningful, and not mere stylistic flourish. However, in response to Karaism, Rav Saadya Gaon greatly downplayed the role of exegesis, and promoted instead tradition as the true source of understanding of the text. This exegetical approach applied all the more so to non-legal matters. This methodology became popular among the Rishonim. However, the 19th century saw the rise of attack on the Written Law itself. To combat this, the Malbim and others resurrected the approach that each word in Scripture is deliberate and meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>Thus: was Malbim an innovator? <strong>Yes</strong> as his approach was in contradistinction to that of the previous millennium of Bible commentary. <strong>But</strong> it largely followed the approach of <em>Hazal</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some relevant quotations and paraphrasing from Elman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One passage that relates to omnisignificance is the rabbinic interpretation of Deut 32 47: “For it is not an empty thing for you it is your very life. And if [it appears] devoid [of moral or halakhic meaning] it is you [who have not worked out its moral or legal significance].\" (Yerushalmi Ketubot 8:11).</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Saadya Gaon attacks Karaite methods of biblical exegesis, in particular their use of analogy. Since many midrashic middot may be categorized as forms of analogy (hekesh, gezerah shavah, binyan av or mah matzinu) or work by analogy (kelal u-ferat and its near relations, ribbuy and micut, etc.), we may understand his strategic retreat from this battleground and his insistence on tradition alone. Depriving halakhic midrash of real authority prepared the ground for his counterattack on Karaite legal exegesis. This view continued to exercise influence so long as Karaism remained a threat, and its traces are to be found in the works of later Geonim, R. Shmuel ha-Nagid, R. Yehudah ha-Levi, and Ibn Ezra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is Rav Saadya Gaon minimized the textual role played even by halakhic portions of the Torah, explaining the ultimate source for the derived laws as being the tradition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus, when faced with the anti-rabbinic challenges of nineteenth-century heterodox movements, one influential representative of Orthodox thinking on the matter, R. Y. I. Halevy Rabinowitz (1847-1914), author of Dorot Rishonim, took a similar stance. Note the following, from a volume published in 1875/6.</p>\n  \n  <p>All the derashot in the Talmud [intended] to provide proof-texts (lehasmikh) for the words of the Mishnah are only hints in the biblical texts, ...And the derashah is nothing but a hint for the matter...for from biblical proof-texts (derashah di-qeraei) we learn nothing.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the modern challenge was far more serious. While the Karaites rejected rabbinic interpretation and authority, nineteenth-century thought challenged those and more; scriptural authority and divinity were eventually threatened as well. The new challenge thus required a response broader than R. Saadiah's polemics against Karaism.</p>\n  \n  <p>It thus fell to the lot of nineteenth-century scholars such as R. Yaakov Zevi Mecklenberg (1785-1865), R. Meir Leibush Weiser (1809-1879, known by the acronym Malbim), and Samson Rafael Hirsch (1808-1888) to attempt to come to grips with omnisignificance again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding Malbim's approach to <em>peshat</em> in contradistinction to that of his predecessors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It differs from Nahmanides' revival of the omnisignificant program in the Middle Ages. Nahmanides dealt with issues of proportion, repetition and sequence, as I have shown elsewhere. But he did so within a context that allowed for peshat as an independent area of interpretation, a point that Malbim is at pains to disavow. For Malbim, the medieval distinction between peshat and derash is all but obliterated; in his oft-quoted phrase, to use Harris rendering, the peshat that accords with the true and clear rules of language is only to be found in [what we conventionally refer to as] the derash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding whether Malbim himself was 100% serious with all of this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kugel, in his history of the study of parallelism, notes that Malbim was clearly aware of the binary structure and semantic pairing of parallelism..., [but] he frequently stated that repetition as such did not exist. He rejected utterly the approach to biblical style that had been adopted increasingly by Jews and Christians since the Renaissance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Elman further documents examples where Malbim extends Hazal's exegetical techniques. Thus, he was certainly an especially when compared with Rishonim, but his approach was broadly consistent with his contemporaries such as Rav Hirsch, and was broadly based on Hazal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I always understood it as a deeper way of looking at the words of Tanach. </p>\n\n<p>When learning Tanach, the question arises, \"Why is the writer/composer saying the same thing twice\".</p>\n\n<p>A superficial (<a href=\"http://dictionary.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superficial\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not in the negative sense</a>) answer is that it is poetic. This answers all the questions. We don't have to find a deeper meaning for the repetition.</p>\n\n<p>On a deeper level however, one can say (as the Malbim does) that even the repetition has a purpose. It's not just saying the same thing twice, but saying (and teaching us) something slightly different.</p>\n\n<p>So (as I understood it), the Malbim is telling us that, while it is true that the writer/composer was being poetic, every word and phrase is exact, and there is something we can learn from it.</p>\n\n<p>While not entirely the same, there is an argument between R' Akiva and R' Yishmael (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=3&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 3A</a>) with regards to the Torah repeating a law. R' Yishmael says that there may be a whole extra sentence just to teach us one thing. R' Akiva on the other hand, says that the sentence is not extra, and is coming to teach us something.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Make sure to check out the discussion in the comments, but I'd like to put the idea expressed in my answer in slightly different words:</p>\n\n<p>There are many passages in Tanach that repeat the same concept using different words to express essentially the same thing. The question arises, \"Why express the same idea twice, using different words?\"</p>\n\n<p>To this, many commentaries answer that it is a distinction without a difference. The same concept is being repeated using different words, purely for poetic reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The Malbim takes it a step further, and says that it is not a distinction without difference, purely for poetical reasons. If we carefully translate the words chosen to express the concept, we can learn something from each of those words. </p>\n\n<p>To me, this still falls under the category of p'shat. </p>\n\n<p>As an example of this, I recently saw the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9617&pgnum=190\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban on Devarim 13:2</a>. There, where the verse talks about the miracles that a prophet may do, the Ramban differentiates between an <strong>Ot</strong> and a <strong>Mofet</strong>. He explains that they are two different types of miracles (<strong>Ot</strong> == A sign for the future ; <strong>Mofet</strong> == A wondrous act that was not foretold). After that, he brings the Sifri, who says that they are not two different things, but two different ways of saying the same thing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is true that Malbim may have gone further than many rishonim, probably as a reaction to the Maskilim. However, this doesn't mean he was a radical innovator. Like the question and other answers mention, there are different levels of interpretation and explanation. So a text may repeat something for poetic effect, but still choose words that have a meaning. When Radak says something is repeated poetically, it doesn't mean he would reject any additional explanation of the matter. While he may not have agreed with the need to explain every repetition, it doesn't mean he would reject every individual explanation of the Malbim. </p>\n\n<p>So Malbim was a natural development in Biblical exegesis, something that could be accepted as a commentary. More surprising perhaps is that Ralbag is so many editions of Tanach, or that the Brisker approach to Gemara became so widespread. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The author did not have a choice with his wording, but rather used the only phrasology available to convey the exact point he was trying to make.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems preferable to say a word has a specific meaning and isn't just there stylistically, since that gives more significance to the words of Tanach. I don't think it means there's no style either, just that the words were chosen to be able to accomplish both purposes. The only question is how well such an approach holds up in practice. Although is commentary his studied, I don't think his approach is necessarily accepted as always being correct. </p>\n\n\n",

This always seemed rather insubstantial as the mist that issues from an aerosol can is actually just small liquid droplets.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there any truth to this? Is it indeed forbidden for this, or any other, reason?

He adds that it may be only a Rabbinic prohibition, as it is a Melacha Sheina Tzricha Legufa.</p>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25074&st=&pgnum=177\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Pesach</a> he writes that in order for one to violate Zora one must do it in a way of Borer.

R' Akiva permitted it for two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Yerushalmi isn't mentioned in the early poskim and the Halacha is like the Bavli that Zora requires Borer (a separation of good from bad) and</p></li>\n<li><p>Even if there is a concept of Zora where there is no Borer, it's possible that it applies only to things that grow from the ground (as winnowing is similar to threshing and gathering which are only prohibited to be done to items which grow from the ground). As R' Akiva Eiger says that spit is considered something that grows from the ground, the Yerushalmi prohibits spitting into the wind. However, water (which) isn't something which grows from the ground and would be permitted to scatter. </p></li>\n<li><p>One doesn't care if the water is scattered, and according to some opinions a Psik Reisha whose result isn't needed is allowed.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The second reason is the Alfei Menashe which says that the Yerushalmi isn't prohibiting spitting into the wind because of Zora but because of carrying in a public domain. Therefore, everyone (including the Yerushalmi) would agree that Zora requires Borer.</p>\n\n<p>So it appears from the Shulchan Aruch Harav that there is (at least) a Rabbinical decree against scattering objects (the Shulchan Aruch Harav includes bread in the prohibition, and the Ktzos Hashulchan includes paper).</p>\n\n<p>According to the Mishna Brura, it would appear to be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"https://smslarav.co.il/rabbis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Zalmanov</a>, one would be <a href=\"https://smslarav.co.il/question/5913ad0e2d2ab20001ed3b60\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">permitted</a> to apply spray deodorant on Shabbos. Presumably, it's because there's no <em>wind</em> involved in spraying deodorant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From what I recall, <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/Display.asp?ClipDate=12/17/2007\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> seems like a pretty accurate summary.  In short, it is debatably an issur deoraisa, but the custom is to be lenient based on the bavli.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A longer summary:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Winnowing is a process of throwing threshed grains into the wind to rid them of their (lighter) chaff.  </p>\n\n<p>Talmud Yerushalmi applies this melacha to anythig thrown to the wind to scatter. For example, the Yerushalmi would prohibit shaking your tablecloth into the air to get rid of the crumbs.</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Bavli limits this melacha to a form of selection (borer, meraked and zoreh are similar, but use different vehicles).  Zoreh is the melacha of selecting through wind.  Accordingly, one would only be chayav if there was a borer-type purification process.</p>\n\n<p>The application to aerosols is obvious- the Yerushalmi would say the scattering particles is a Torah prohibition, the Bavli would say there is no connection  to a melacha here since the particles are all similar.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Rema (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=288\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 319:17</a>) seems to sides with the Yerushalmi, later poskim are lenient for various reasons (see Biur Halacha there).</p>\n\n\n",

If so, according to the Arizal (based on msh210's answer) the <em>Murex trunculus</em> could not be the real Techelet.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The source for the Chilazon being in the Kineret is the Zohar, II, 48b, on <a href=\"https://www2.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar/zohar&vol=21&sec=754\">parashat Terumah</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>\"And blue\" (Shemot 25:3): Rabbi Yitzchak said: Blue [<em>techelet</em>] is from that fish that is in the Sea Genosar, WHICH IS THE SEA OF GALILEE, which is in the portion of Zvulon. This color is needed for the work of the tabernacle to show this color, AS IT IS WRITTEN BEFORE US.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sea of Galilee is the same as the Kineret, which is the same as the Sea of Genosar. So it is not originally the Arizal who says this but the Zohar. This is <a href=\"http://vintagefrumteens.blogspot.com/2006/11/halacha-techeiles.html\">apparently</a> somewhat problematic, in making Zevulun's portion that of the Kineret; there does not seem to be another source for this assertion.</p>\n\n<p><em>If</em> this Zohar is from Rashbi, and this Rabbi Yitzchak was a contemporary of Rashbi, this would be testimony from the time that <em>techelet</em> was still around.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee\">sea of Galilee</a> is a freshwater lake.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the <strong>gemara</strong> in <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_26.html\">Shabbat 26a</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/dafyomi2/megilah/points/mg-ps-06.htm\">Megillah 6a</a>?) says that it is found in the Mediterranean Sea. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers [kormim] and husbandmen [yogbim].3  'Kornim:' R. Joseph learnt: This means balsamum gatherers from the En Gedi to Ramah. Yogbim: These are those which catch hilazon4  from the promontory of Tyre as far as Haifa.5</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They still had techelet in the time of Rav Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>And the Rambam (Hilchot Tzitzit 2:2) claims it is found in the Dead Sea, which is saltwater. (Though apparently some claim this is a scribal error for Mediterranean Sea.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב  כֵּיצַד צוֹבְעִין תְּכֵלֶת שֶׁלַּצִּיצִית:  לוֹקְחִין הַצֶּמֶר, וְשׁוֹרִין אוֹתוֹ בְּסִיד; וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְכַבְּסִין אוֹתוֹ, עַד שֶׁיִּהְיֶה נָקִי; וּמַרְתִּיחִין אוֹתוֹ בְּאַהֲלָא וְכַיּוֹצֶא בּוֹ, כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁהַצַּבָּעִין עוֹשִׂין כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּקְלֹט אֶת הָעַיִן.  וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְבִיאִין דַּם חִלָּזוֹן, וְהוּא דָּג שֶׁדּוֹמֶה עֵינוֹ לְעֵין הַיָּם, וְדָמוּ שָׁחוֹר כַּדְּיוֹ, וּבְיָם הַמֶּלַח הוּא מָצוּי.  וְנוֹתְנִין אֶת הַדָּם לְיוּרָה, וְנוֹתְנִין עִמּוֹ סַמָּמְנִין כְּמוֹ הַקִּימוּנְיָא וְכַיּוֹצֶא בָּהּ, כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁהַצַּבָּעִין עוֹשִׂים; וּמַרְתִּיחִין אוֹתוֹ, וְנוֹתְנִין בּוֹ הַצֶּמֶר, עַד שֶׁיֵּעָשֶׂה כְּעֵין הָרָקִיעַ.  וְזוֹ הִיא צוּרַת הַתְּכֵלֶת שֶׁלַּצִּיצִית.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"and it is found in the Yam HaMelach\".</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.tekhelet.com/ResponseJHCS.htm\">some point out</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Needless to say, there is no species that lives in all three habitats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, as msh210 points out in his answer, the <em>murex</em> is not found in the Kineret. It is found in Mediterranean, just as the gemara states.</p>\n\n<p>Should this be a problem with identifying the <em>murex</em> with the <em>chilazon</em>? No, because Rabbinic literature is rife with mutually exclusive descriptions of the chilazon (and other species). (E.g. the Rambam says the blood of chilazon is black, while Rashi says it is blue.) If one were to insist on literal and simultaneous fulfillment of all of these mutually exclusive requirements, there would be <strong>no</strong> species that would fit.</p>\n\n<p>One can explain away the Zohar by saying that this was a late insertion (see Chasam Sofer) or claiming it has deep mystical meaning rather than literal meaning. One can explain away the Rambam as a <em>taut sofer</em>. One can perhaps explain away the gemara by asserting that they were referring to a different type of species falling under the general term <em>chilazon</em>, snail.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To add a bit, based on the clarified question, yes, the Arizal brings it down and seems to treat it as literal. Thus, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14184&pgnum=124\">Shaar Maamarei Rashbi</a>, page 120, we read:</p>\n\n<p>ודע, דהאי נונא, מטטרו׳ן, דיוקנא  דצדיק\n חי  עלמין ,  דאיהו  הוא  דאפיק  האי  גוון תכלא.\n ונמצא  שהוא  בבריאה ,  בשית  דרגין  לכרסיא.\n וממנו היצירה שהוא  עץ  הדעת  טוב  ורע , כי\n כמוך  לו הקליפות,  והיא  מתכסה  בתכלת זה,\n הבא לה על ידי מטטרו׳ן,  דיוקנא  דיוסף  הצדיק ,\nכדכתיב  והוא  נער. וזמ\"ש ,  דיוסף חפי על\n אימיה, שלא יסתכל בה עשו, םטרא  אחרא בישא\n ונתכוונו למה שכתבנו. ותכלת זה נמצא\n בדג שבים כנרת, והוא בחלק זבולון, שהוא\n ירכא שמאלא, הוד, ובה היה אוחז דוד, והיה\n הכנור מנגן מאליו.  ולפיכך היה דוד אדמוני ,\n בסוד ההוד שהוא דין, וממנו התעוררות לזווג\n בחצי הלילה, שהיה קם דוד. בסוד שמאלו תחת\n לראשי.

And he gives is mystical meaning, that Kineret corresponds to the Kinor of David; and the portion of Zevulun corresponds to the ירכא שמאלא. I agree that this can be read as a statement of the <em>metzius</em>, followed by a mystical explanation of the significance of that <em>metzius</em>. Yet I think someone who is motivated could well read the entire thing as a mystical interpretation of the cited Zohar.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I don't see the need to appeal to mystical explanations. The Zohar (plausibly) contradicts the gemara. And the Arizal did not actually see the chilazon. He is interpreting the Zohar.

And the husbandmen; these are the trappers of the snail [ḥilazon], from which the sky blue dye is produced in the north of the country, in the area between the Promontory of Tyre and Ḥaifa.</p>\n<p>The Zohar, on the other hand, has a very clear assertion that Techelet came from the sea and it explains that this is the Yam Kineret also named in the Zohar as Yam Ginosar.</p>\n<p>Zohar 2:48b says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זְבוּלוּן שׁוֹקָא דִּימִינָא דְּגוּפָא הֲוָה, וְיַם כִּנֶּרֶת הֲוָה\nבְּעַדְבֵיהּ, וּמֵהָכָא אִשְׁתְּכַח חִלָּזוֹן לִתְכֶלְתָּא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Zebulun was the market of the right side of the body, and Yam Kineret was in his share and in there it was found the chilazon of the techelet”</p>\n<p>‎‏Zohar 2:149b says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‎ וּתְכֵלֶת, אָמַר רַבִּי יִצְחָק, תְּכֵלֶת מֵהַהוּא נוּנָא דְּיַמָּא\nדְּגִינוֹסָר, דְּאִיהוּ בְּעַדְבֵיהּ דִּזְבוּלוּן. וְאִצְטְרִיךְ\nגַּוְונָא דָּא לְעוֹבָדָא דְּמַשְׁכְּנָא לְאִתְחֲזָאָה הַאי גּוָֹון</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“And techelet, says Rabbi Yitzchak, techelet is from that fish of the Sea of Ginosar, which is in the portion of Zebulun. And that color is necessary for the avodah of the mishkan to see that color.”</p>\n<p>• Birur Shel Peshuto Shel HaTalmud</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Megillah 6a based on Devarim 33:19 states that the portion of Zebulun had mountains and seas:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‎אָמַר זְבוּלוּן לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל\nעוֹלָם, לְאַחַיי נָתַתָּ לָהֶם שָׂדוֹת וּכְרָמִים, וְלִי נָתַתָּ\nהָרִים וְגִבְעוֹת! לְאַחַיי נָתַתָּ לָהֶם אֲרָצוֹת, וְלִי נָתַתָּ\nיַמִּים וּנְהָרוֹת! אָמַר לוֹ: כּוּלָּן צְרִיכִין לָךְ עַל יְדֵי\nחִלָּזוֹן, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״[עַמִּים הַר יִקְרָאוּ] וּשְׂפוּנֵי טְמוּנֵי\nחוֹל״</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verse should be interpreted as follows: Zebulun said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe! To my brothers, the tribes whose territory is adjacent to mine, You gave fields and vineyards, whereas to me You gave mountains and hills; to my brothers You gave lands, whereas to me You gave seas and rivers. God said back to him: Nevertheless, all will need you due to the ḥilazon, the small sea creature residing in your territory that is the source of the dye used in the ritual fringes [tzitzit]. As it is stated in Moses’ blessing to Zebulun: “They shall call the people to the mountain: There they shall sacrifice offerings of righteousness; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of the hidden treasures of the sand” (Deuteronomy 33:19).</p>\n<p>Josephus in Antiquities of The Jews, Book V, Chapter 1, Par. 22 states :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tribe of Zebulon's lot included the land which lay as far as the\nLake of Genesareth, and that which belonged to Carmel and the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since Zebulun was the only tribe that was catching the chilazon, then Zebulun’s share can be simply understood as the area of mount Carmel (and Modern Haifa) and its seashore, the mountains of Tzfad and the west coast of the Sea of Galilee.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that other non-Israelite people were not catching the chilazon in other areas and indeed we know that the Phoenicians who were north of Zebulun’s share also caught the chilazon in their Mediterranean waters, but it seems the Jews only did so in the area that corresponded to Zebulun.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Sota 46b is more specific and states that the Techelet preferred by the Jews was not dyed by the seashore but in a city called Luz:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‎וַיֵּלֶךְ הָאִישׁ אֶרֶץ הַחִתִּים וַיִּבֶן עִיר וַיִּקְרָא שְׁמָהּ\nלוּז הוּא שְׁמָהּ עַד הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה תַּנְיָא הִיא לוּז שֶׁצּוֹבְעִין\nבָּהּ תְּכֵלֶת הִיא לוּז שֶׁבָּא סַנְחֵרִיב וְלֹא בִּלְבְּלָהּ\nנְבוּכַדְנֶצַּר וְלֹא הֶחְרִיבָהּ וְאַף מַלְאַךְ הַמָּוֶת אֵין לוֹ\nרְשׁוּת לַעֲבוֹר בָּהּ אֶלָּא זְקֵנִים שֶׁבָּהּ בִּזְמַן שֶׁדַּעְתָּן\nקָצָה עֲלֵיהֶן יוֹצְאִין חוּץ לַחוֹמָה וְהֵן מֵתִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“And the man went to the land of the Hittites, and he built a city, and he called its name Luz; that is its name to this day” (Judges 1:26). It is taught in a baraita: This is the city Luz where sky blue wool is dyed. It is the same city Luz where, although Sennacherib came and exiled many nations from place to place, he did not disarrange and exile its inhabitants; Nebuchadnezzar, who conquered many lands, did not destroy it; and even the angel of death has no permission to pass through it. Rather, its Elders, when they have decided that they have reached the end of life, go outside the city wall and die.</p>\n<p>This city was not by the Mediterranean sea but the Ben Yehoyada ad loc. explains that they would bring dying material (either the chilazon alive or its dry glands) from the sea until Luz and dye them there as it would come out nicer.</p>\n<p>We see in Sanhedrin 12a how two rabbis from Tiberias, the last location of Sanhedrin, had secured techelet from Luz and intended to send it to Babylon but were prevented from doing so.</p>\n<p>There is also evidence of chilazon shells up to the mountains on the way from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Galilee which may be explained by the fact that the whole region was producing murex products and trading them but the techelet from Luz was preferred among the sages.</p>\n<p>While we can’t know where Luz was located, it seems that it was in the northern part of Israel (Megillah 6a), around the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and not too far from Tiberias (Sanhedrin 12a).</p>\n<p>•Birur Shel Peshuto Shel HaZohar</p>\n<p>The Zohar 3:163b mentions that יָ''ם, בְּהַהוּא תְּכֵלֶת דְּנוּנָא, דְּשִׁבְעִין דַּרְגִּין דְּיַמָּא the ‘sea’, in which (there is) the techelet from the fish, from the seventy levels of the sea” and Zohar 2:23a says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‎ שִׁבְעָה עַמּוּדִים, דְּאַרְעָא סְמִיכָא עָלַיְיהוּ. וְאִינּוּן\nשִׁבְעָה יַמִּים. וְיַם כִנֶּרֶת שַׁלְטָא עָלַיְיהוּ. אָמַר רִבִּי\nיְהוּדָה, לָא תֵּימָא דְּשַׁלְטָא עָלַיְיהוּ, אֶלָּא דְּאִתְמַלְיָיא\nמִנַּיְיהוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, according to these Zoharic passages, Yam Kineret rules over the seven seas which is clarified in the passage as meaning that it gets water from all of them and the fish of the techelet is from these 7 seas that are 70 levels.</p>\n<p>Hence, these two passages could be understood as implying that the fish from which techelet dye is extracted, the chilazon, can be found not just in the Yam Kineret but at least it is also found in some of the seven seas that flow into the Yam Kineret, according to the Zohar, such as the Mediterranean Sea (See Bava Batra 74b) where the Gemara says the chilazon is found.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, since techelet (the final product) was dyed and traded in the area of the Sea of Galilee, the Zohar 2:149b mention of Ginosar may refer to the whole area where techelet came from, the whole region of the Sea of Galilee, (see this expansive meaning also found in Rashi and Steinslatz English Perush on Eruvin 30a גינוסר - ארץ ים כינרת ופירותיה מתוקין).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Zohar 2:48b could be understood as that in the Sea of Galilee the chilazon extract or dry glands ready for dying were ‘found’ to be purchased by techelet artisans.</p>\n<p>(As a way of remez, the word אִשְׁתְּכַח in Zohar 2:48b can be rendered in Aramaic as ‘forgotten’ (See Jastrow and the Gemara examples in there). If so, the Zoharic passage would mean that in the Sea of Galilee the identity of the chilazon was finally forgotten as the last Sanhedrin was dismissed in 425 CE after the death of Gamaliel IV.)</p>\n<p>In another vein, the Baal Hatechelet suggested that the Zohar was describing the period before the Babylonian exile and the Talmud described the period of the Second Temple and afterward until the chilazon was ultimately lost. This resolution is problematic due to the fact that the Zohar is attributed to Shimon Bar Yochai who lived and potentially described the situation in his time and we have no external or internal records of the chilazon being found exclusively in the Sea of Galilee from the period of the First Temple. Actually, if we were to go down this path, it would appear to be the opposite! It could be suggested that the Zohar describes the situation when the Jewish production of techelet took place after the return from Babylon until the times of the Gemara and the Gemara is referring to where during the First Temple period the catching of the chilazon took place (between Haifa and Tyre) and where the sages would obtain techelet in the Second Temple period and afterward.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it is clear that the Sea of Galilee does not get water from the Mediterranean Sea or the Dead Sea. It is also physically difficult to understand that an animal that lived in freshwater would move or be moved successfully to a salty body of water, namely, the Mediterranean Sea without a miracle that is not explicitly mentioned in any source.</p>\n<p>Hence, these passages about the chilazon shouldn’t be understood literally like many other statements of the Zohar in general which seem to be impossible on a physical level al derech hateva, but are speaking of kabbalistic concepts of the Sephirot as commentaries on the Zohar like the Baal HaSulam and Matok MiDvash understand them.</p>\n<p>• Can we follow a strictly literal reading of the Zohar in these passages of the Chilazon and techelet against the Talmud?</p>\n<p>The Sefer HaKana (ד״ה ענין יראת המקום) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So my son, be careful from now on, not to rule based on Aggados that\nare not understood except by the baalei hasod.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, anyone should be wary to pasken Halacha against the Talmud from the Zohar or Midrashim on any topic including the location of the chilazon.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is a well-established principle that we do not pasken halacha from Midrashim, even less so against the Talmud. (See Talmud Yerushalmi, Chagigah 1:8, 12; Tosafos Yom Tov, Berachot Perek 5, Mishna 4; Nodah B’Yehuda, Yoreh Deah Siman קסא; Chidusei Rashba Megila 15; the Maharal in Beer HaGola, Beer 7, Perek 15.)</p>\n<p>Similarly, regarding ruling halacha from the Zohar, it should be mentioned that while many Zoharic practices and stringencies had made their way into Halacha, see Knesses Gedolah quoted by the Magen Abraham 25:20 & Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chaim 25:28 on how one should follow the Talmud over Zohar on halachic matters when they contradict one another and that Zoharic practices or stringencies no found in the Talmud can’t be enforced on the general public.</p>\n\n\n",

It says that if you do not mix the oil with אניגרון then you say no bracha because the pure olive oil is מזיק (unhealthy or damaging to your body).</p>\n\n<p>How does this gemara stand in terms of modern science? Is pure olive oil unhealthy? Does adding אניגרון help? If not, do any poskim consider that the Halacha may have changed and pure olive oil once again gets the bracha of Borei Peri HaEtz?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R Binyanim Tabadi was asked this question by someone who ate one spoon of olive oil every day, enjoyed it and wanted to know whether to make a blessing in light of the gemara you quote. He answered as follows (see <a href=\"http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=48992183275664174697\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the full Hebrew response - second question on the right)</p>\n\n<p>There is a dispute amongst <em>rishonim</em> on the proper blessing. The Rambam understands that one \"goes down by one level\" from <em>peri haeitz</em> to <em>sheakol</em> because of the damage (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Blessings.8.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 8:2</a>) while most of the <em>rishonim</em> and the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.202.4?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 202:4</a>) rules there is no blessing.</p>\n\n<p>He then asks two questions\n - is the <em>mazik</em> that the gemara describes really an objective reality or more of a <em>segula</em>?\n - is today's olive oil which goes through a refining process the same as in the times of the gemara? </p>\n\n<p>He learns from Tosfot on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Avodah_Zarah.36a.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avoda Zara 35b</a> that olive oil was something sharp and strong, and that in times of <em>Chazal</em> drinking oil was difficult like vinegar in our days. Therefore the <em>mazik</em> of the gemara is an objective reality.</p>\n\n<p>Since today olive oil is different, and that there is real pleasure for some in drinking it, therefore one could go back to the blessing <em>borei peri haeitz</em>. Such was the ruling of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Eliyahu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Mordechai Eliyahu</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other <em>poskim</em> believe that olive oil is still <em>mazik</em> these days, but one who enjoys drinking it, should recite <em>sheakol</em> (as it is forbidden to derive pleasure from this world without blessing) (see more sources <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/10-09-02/#ref_4_9_2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Last, some poskim (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Wosner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Shmuel Halevi Wozner</a>) felt one should not deviate from the <em>din</em> of the gemara and not recite any blessing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Here's what I understand from the Gemara:</p>\n\n<p>Drinking oil alone doesn't get a bracha since it's mazik- it's like having a stand-alone butter, but a little better for you.  </p>\n\n<p>Drinking oil through anigron, the oil doesn't get a bracha because it's tafel to the anigron- think butter on bread.  You wouldn't have the oil because it's mazik.  It's there to enhance the anigron.</p>\n\n<p>There is one case where one makes a bracha on oil:  If someone drinks a lot of oil for health (ie his throat bothers him).  Although normally this alone would not get a bracha, since here he gets benefit from the anigron and the anigron cannot be said to be primary in this case, the anigron flavor enhances the oil and becomes \"a good tasting oil\" and gets the bracha of haetz.</p>\n\n<p>Strange, but I think it makes sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The olive oil we get in the store is not really pure olive oil,  as such it has nothing to do with that Gemara. Our \"pure extra virgin olive oil\" is roughly 30% real olive oil, the rest is made up of other cheaper oils or processed to change the natural taste of the oil.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhuyghe/2014/03/05/the-scam-of-olive-oil-and-its-antidote/#4eabe1896a36\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-overtime-how-to-buy-olive-oil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for starters, but this seems to be a well documented fact.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.olivetomato.com/how-to-recognize-good-and-bad-olive-oil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">many sites</a> describe the real olive oil as having a biting burning sensation on the back of the throat. Something must people find unpleasant which is how this big scam is easily pulled. We don't like the real stuff when we taste it! It also sounds like a nice qualifying term to describe what the Gemara called אוזוקי מזיק ליה. And as the articles states, it is possible to cover up this distasteful effect by various means, אניגרון would probably qualify.</p>\n\n\n",

According to the opinions that permit shituf for non-Jews, are they allowed to worship it as well? If not what constitutes worship that is prohibited?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simplest explanation for what this rabbi was saying is that he assumes that shittuf is prohibited; therefore when Tosafos says that בני נח לא הוזהרו על השיתוף what that means is that in the context of a שבועה there is no prohibition for the ב\"נ to mention another being, but there is still a prohibition to worship another being. However, according to those acharonim who understand Tosafos broadly, this would obviously include worship--since the whole discussion is about Christianity. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, I would suggest that the rabbi in question was making a different distinction between two types of <em>shittuf</em>, following R. Yaakov Emden in She'eilas Yaavetz 1:41. R. Yaakov Emden distinguishes between belief in multiple gods which are viewed as equal vs. belief in one supreme God “combined” with worship of lower beings. According to R. Yaakov Emden, the former is considered idolatry even for gentiles whereas the latter is permitted for gentiles. [See also Mor u-ketziah, ed. A. Bombach (Jerusalem, 1996), sec. 224, p. 267 and notes there.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Since no responses have been given so far, I allow myself to write my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>I have not found a source similar to what you are asking.

So if anyone as much as thinks otherwise - it is <em>kfira b'ikar</em>. Even to tose who count the <em>ikarim</em> differently this would be either <em>kfira b'ikar</em> or, at any rate, a false belief.</li>\n<li><em>Avoda zara</em>, as any other sin, is only punishable when there are עדים and התראה.

So the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=483\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rma</a> wrote as well.

So the answers really depend on you and your community. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some answers that I've found from different Rabbinic sources on the Internets:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong> Don't take halachic advice from me! <strong>Consult <em>your</em> Rabbi</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rabbi Asher Lopatin: <a href=\"http://www.asbi.org/public/Re_heating_on_Shabbat1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dos and Don'ts of Re-heating on Shabbat</a>. R. Lopatin is an Askenaz modern Orthodox rabbi in Chicago. I found this source to be concise and helpful.</li>\n<li>Rabbi Harvey Well: <a href=\"http://www.ortorah.org/cook1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cooking and Reheating Food on Shabbat</a></li>\n<li>Rabbi Shlomo Levi: <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/h2-plata.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Analysis of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's lenient stand on re-heating cold food by using a plata</a>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Ovadia Yosef</a> is a Sephardi Gadol (great rabbi) in Israel.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My personal conclusions from the above sources are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The food we're talking about here is solid and was completely cooked before Shabbat. The plata was activated before Shabbat (turned on or its timer was set).</li>\n<li>Can I use it to reheat solid food from the refrigerator on Shabbat? Yes. Rabbi Asher Lopatin says so clearly, source 1. Rav Ovadia Yosef is reported to say it's ok (source 3).</li>\n<li>Do I need to put an empty pot/cooking tray between the plata and the food container? This is an extra stringency which many follow. And many do not. So check your rabbi and community for your personal answers. R. Lopatin does not require. If I read source 3 correctly, R. Ovadia Yosef doesn't either.</li>\n<li>I can move the food to the plata on Shabbat morning, right? Yes.</li>\n<li>Any other issues with using the plata? I can't determine this from the sources.</li>\n<li>Should I not stir the food while on the plata or does that issue not apply? I can't determine this from the sources I found.</li>\n<li>I can't reheat soup or other liquids on the plata, right? Definitely cannot. Only \"solid\" foods, foods which are not \"poured.\" (Some amount of gravy can be on the chicken.) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I found R. Lopatin's instructions of the most help. As I note above, he's firmly in the Modern Orthodox camp. It is interesting that Rabbi Ovadia Yosef is reported to have given the same opinion re plata use.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus answer: Is a plata the same as a blech? Definitely not. A plata is like a Kdeira Blech (a water blech). But a plata is not the same as a Kdeira Blech. R. Lopatin treats the two the same (source 1). But some do not--that's where the idea of an extra pot on top of  a Kdeira Blech or, perhaps, plata comes in. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong> This issue of reheating cold food on Shabbat (that was cooked before), is a specific area of leniency/stringency that different rabbis and different communities have their own opinions on. No answer is \"right.\" Rather, each community's answer is \"right\" for that community.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that there are many sources in Judaism which argue against the concept of \"the more piety the better.\" These sources would urge you to not make the mistake of thinking that greater stringency is better. What matters is your community's answer to these questions. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are some who <em>do</em> feel that \"the greater the piety the better.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added</strong> In answer to the question: where are the sources about piety? Unfortunately I can't quote specific sources. One was from Talmud Sukkot as analyzed by Professor Moshe Halbertal in a class I took. He discussed this specific issue and referenced other Talmudic sources on the issue too. Another example is the mitzvah of the meal before Yom Kippur--thus limiting the length of the fast. There are others too. Remember that when the sources explicitly limit something, they're often saying that it is not better to do \"more.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A late answer, and again, consult your local Rov:</p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Yehoshua Neuwirth's Shemirath Shabbath, chapter 1, sections 36-37 and 60:</p>\n\n<p>Any type of food, even uncooked, may be placed in a pot standing <strong><em>on top of</em></strong> another pot on a fire, <strong><em>as long as there is no possibility of the food reaching a temperature of 45 degrees centigrade/113 degrees fahrenheit</em></strong>.  The intention of removing the food before it reaches this temperature is not by itself sufficient.  It must not be able to reach this temperature no matter how long it is left.</p>\n\n<p>Fully cooked food of any type <strong><em>that is still partly warm</em></strong> may be placed <strong><em>on top of</em></strong> a pot standing on the fire, even if it will reach a high temperature, as long as there is no chance of it roasting. It can be on the lid of the pot or in a pot on top of the pot.</p>\n\n<p>Fully cooked solid food, even if it is cold or frozen, may be put <strong><em>on top of</em></strong> a pot standing on the fire, even if it will reach a high temperature, as long as there is no risk that it will start roasting. Therefor, cooked meat without gravy may <strong>not</strong> be placed on top of a pot on the fire, since it will now roast in the dry heat.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to heat solid food is dependent on there not being anything (such as solidified fat or grease) that will melt when heated.  This is due to the prohibition of melting on Shabbath.  Exceptions: if there is only a small amount of fat which mingles with the rest of the food as it melts, this is permitted. Dissolving a sauce which is customary to each in a congealed state, such as fish sauce, is also permitted.  </p>\n\n<p>Since the above all talk about placing on top of a pot and not directly on the fire, you would need to using an inverted pan (or even a pot!) underneath any food that you are warming.</p>\n\n\n",

(By the way, Rinat Yisrael siddur has NER CHANUKA. So does the GR\"A siddur,\n  Eizor Eliyahu. Koren siddur has NER SHEL CHANUKA. So too T'filat Kol\n  Peh.)</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Candles for Shabbat are candles, in the sense that they produce light (which is their main function), heat, fire - just like \"regular\"\n  candles.

We are not allowed to use them - not their light nor heat nor fire. As we say, ELAH LIR-OTAM\n  BILAVAD, (they are) exclusively to look at them, to see them. That's\n  it. They are not candles that are being used for Chanuka. They're\n  CHANUKA CANDLES.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>[Here's another MASHAL... It's like the difference between the flowers\n  one buys for his Shabbat table - here and outside Israel. In most\n  other places of the world, one would go to a flower shop and buy\n  flowers, using the flowers to honor Shabbat. They are flowers for\n  Shabbat. But in Israel, one usually buys Shabbat flowers. They are\n  flowers that are being sold for Shabbat by vendors who only sell\n  flowers on Erev Shabbat and Chag. Same flowers, but different.]</p>\n  \n  <p>Again, this is not meant to discredit referring to them in the bracha\n  as NER SHEL CHANUKA. The gemara and many authorities since, have given\n  the text as NER SHEL CHANUKA. The above was just meant to explain why\n  other sources go for NER CHANUKA as the ending of the bracha. </p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, with NER CHANUKA, the first bracha has 13 words,\n  corresponding to the 13 MIDOT of G-d's mercy. With the second bracha\n  also having 13 words, the two brachot add to 26 words, 26 being the\n  numeric value of HaShem's name. (NER CHANUKA and NER SHEL'CHANUKA both\n  fit this numeric observation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Magen Avrohom <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/603\">siman</a> 676 says SHELCHANKAH (no space)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does \"aerosol\" have to do with spitting in the wind, or winnowing?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12608/597\">In this answer over here</a> it is explained, that a \"question\" comes up with aerosol cans, based on a gemora which asks if spitting in the wind counts as winnowing.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the spitting in the wind case makes sense.  There is wind, and the wind causes liquid to be \"strewn\".</p>\n\n<p>However, an aerosol can is normally used indoors, where no wind exists.  Even if wind does exist, the answer seems to imply that the presence of wind is not a factor here.</p>\n\n<p>Now, aerosol works in the following way. A compressed liquid is put into a canister; when the nozzle is pressed, the pressure from that compression forces the liquid up the pipe, into the nozzle; and then that tiny hole of a nozzle causes the contents inside to come out in a pressure stream. (Having little space causes more pressure.)  Due to the lack of pressure outside of the can, the contents then spread out in a cone shape.</p>\n\n<p>So why is spitting into the wind compared here?  Notice the gemora doesn't talk about spitting on shabbos in general, just into the wind.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I read (I don't remember where) that an aerosol does <strong>not</strong> trangress the <em>melachah</em> of winnowing, but an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomizer_nozzle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">atomizer</a> does.</p>\n\n<p>An aerosol keeps its content under pressure, and pressing the nozzle simply unblocks an opening and allows it to escape. An atomizer blows air past the liquid which gets picked up by the low pressure generated.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/deQxV.jpg\" alt=\"Principle of operation of an atomizer\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Using an aerosol can is permitted on shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>There was a discussion at one point, if aerosol is like \"winnowing\" (sorting wheat from chaff with the power of the wind.), which is one of the 39 categories of action prohibited on shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>However, in order to be considered winnowing, the substance must be separated by the wind in the atmosphere - or by extension found in Talmud Yerushalmi, by the \"wind\" of a person's lungs, via the mouth.</p>\n\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein notes that, in the case of an aerosol can, the substance is not propelled by either type of wind.  Rather, the contents are under high pressure, and pressing the nozzle merely exposes the high-pressure material to an atmosphere of lower pressure, which naturally expels the substance into the lower pressure area (i.e. the room).</p>\n\n<p>More information on air pressure here: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rcn27.dial.pipex.com/cloudsrus/pressure.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rcn27.dial.pipex.com/cloudsrus/pressure.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The source for this R' Moshe Feinstein psak is the book \"39 Melochos\", p. 377-8;</p>\n\n<p>Also see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1599&pgnum=325\" rel=\"nofollow\">Minchas Yitzchok 6:26</a>, who comes to the same conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>As a final note, I will point out that the majority of shabbos-keepers already utilize aerosol cans on shabbos, so one need not worry about \"al tifrosh min ha tzibur\" or \"maras ayin\".</p>\n\n\n",

He is not a rationalist, though sometimes his conclusions are the same as the rationalist meforshim. But, if he thought that the best peshat in a pasuk was that magic was real, for example, he would endorse it as such.</p>\n\n<p>He dislikes and criticizes derash, when intended seriously as historical and literal meaning of the pasuk. He dislikes and criticizes the 'philosophical derash' of Ibn Ezra, Abarbanel, and Rambam, as well.</p>\n\n<p>He will consider dikduk, nikkud and trup, though he does not consider nikkud and trup to be dispositive. (If you want to see the intersection of trup and peshat, he is an excellent source.) He also will cite and consider the opinions of non-Jewish Biblical scholars, and of historical documents, and of the Peshitta. While he suggested some limited emendations of the Biblical text, this was not on Torah, only in Nach. And he criticized his contemporaries for suggesting emendations of the Biblical text, because he thought that they were idiots and ignoramuses who were not applying the methodology correctly.</p>\n\n<p>He is certainly not 'mainstream' in the yeshiva world, for a variety of reasons. Open criticism of the Zohar and kabbalah in general is certainly one component of it. (I would note that people don't reject the Chasam Sofer for asserting that the Zohar is a forgery, even though the Chasam Sofer's father presumably believed in the authenticity of the Zohar.) Mental association of Shadal with maskilim also contributes to it, as well as his focus on peshat over derash, would also help.</p>\n\n<p>But the Rav cited him on one occasion. And Nechama Leibovitch cited him, I think. There is an idea, put forth by the Rambam, of שמע האמת ממי שאמרה. So even if he is not 'mainstream', if his ideas are good, I think we should consider them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While we certainly are all going to disagree on which works should be given how much weight, there are a wide variety of Rabbanim whose works or teachings have gained wide acceptance in the observant community. Additionally, while a particular work may not have received <i>popular</i> recognition, or was unable to maintain a high profile with the passage of time, its influence may be felt indirectly  by its influence on and reference by more widely acknowledged works.</p>\n\n<p>Insofar as Jewish law (and perhaps to a lesser extent ideology) takes into consideration the weight of a Rabbi's authority in addition to a more sterile evaluation of the strength of his argument, it would seem that a work which does not enjoy either the primary or secondary recognition mentioned above must fend for itself. It, whether classic or contemporary, may make good arguments but it must be evaluated on its own without providing \"what to rely on\".</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, while a work being widely accepted (and/or influential on generally accepted leaders of klal Yisrael) doesn't mean that its positions are certified correct or practices it endorses are unimpeachable, a <i>great deal</i> of deference is given, we generally try to understand it as compatible as possible with other similarly authoritative works, and we are reluctant to outright reject its positions just because we don't fully \"understand\" where it is coming from: it IS what to rely on.</p>\n\n<p>I do not think it is appropriate for me to comment of the specific case you mention. Nor do I think that a sources familiarity to the average yeshiva student is a good indication of whether or not they are mainstream. But in general I think that how mainstream a work is can be judged somewhat fairly by whether not you (can) encounter it while learning reliable Torah sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Shadal is not a main commentary.</p>\n\n<p>The only people who will know the name are people who have found reference to him on the internet, or people who studied Judaic texts in Universities.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the main reason for this, is because his father was into gematria, while he wrote very negatively against the Zohar.</p>\n\n<p>To make this more explicite.  I believe it is the fact that he went against his father, as well as going against the Zohar that makes him not mainstream.  There are plenty of accepted commentaries that write against the Zohar, but those people tend to come from communities and families which have their own \"messorah\" to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm truly interested and do whatever it may be to be considered a friend.</p>\n\n<p>What are the first steps for someone like me, who is considering conversion to Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 24)\n\n<p>I started preparing for conversion in 1999 during my undergraduate years, and finalized it in 2001.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest thing for me was to get an understanding of the legitimacy of different threads in Orthodoxy. I had a hard time accepting that Modern Orthodoxy could be legitimate, but eventually embraced what you might call right-wing MO.</p>\n\n<p>Finding a rabbi you trust to guide you will help a lot. I'm very independent and slow to trust, so I tried to do it myself. In any case you will at least need someone to consult with regarding practical halachic issues particular to you.</p>\n\n<p>If you can move to an Orthodox community, that will be beneficial in starting to practice. I learned on my own for a while, then when I was home for summers, participated in shul on Shabbos. Conversion boards generally require that one live in an Orthodox community before finalizing the conversion. I left my college (Oberlin) and transferred to City Univ. of NY (CUNY) when I got to the point of praying daily with a minyan. I was involved with <a href=\"http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/orthodoxconversiontojudaism\">http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/orthodoxconversiontojudaism</a>; as far as I know it is still a valuable resource.</p>\n\n<p>Some key English texts are IMO:</p>\n\n<p>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch - best crash course (if you can call it that) in everyday halachah. Concise and comprehensive coverage of normal situations.</p>\n\n<p>SR Hirsch's The Nineteen Letters - if you are big-picture and leaning more toward engagement in society as opposed to withdrawal, this is a wonderful and accessible introduction to his \"philosophy\" of Judaism</p>\n\n<p>If you are mystically inclined, Rabbi Akiva Tatz. I initially devoured his books eagerly. He presents the worldview of R' Moshe Shapiro, his own mentor, who stands apart from more rationalist approaches such as Rambam (as conventionally understood) and SR Hirsch. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>@H'Gabriel provided a lot of good resources.  In this answer I'll try to address the conversion issue specifically.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion process is involved and long.  You will go through the following steps, possibly more than once:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Investigation and exploration: beginning to figure out what is attracting you, what alternatives there are (e.g. does being a Noachide meet your needs?), and what the impact would be. You might begin to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/18995/472\">attend services at synagogues</a> (possibly several while you figure out where you're most comfortable).</p></li>\n<li><p>Meeting with one or more rabbis, ending with you finding the one who will be <em>your</em> rabbi.  They will ask you questions; you should ask questions too.  You are looking for a good match, not the objectively-best rabbi (as if there were such a thing).</p></li>\n<li><p>Formal study and beginning to observe mitzvot, under the guidance of your rabbi.  Formal study should definitely include one-on-one study with your rabbi.  It is not unusual for it to also include a course to teach the basics in a group setting.  From what I've seen nobody's making money off those courses; often you just pay for the books.  But you don't need one-on-one time with your rabbi to learn the basics of brachot, kashrut, Shabbat, the prayer service, and so on; a classroom is more efficient, saving the rabbinic time for the personal and advanced topics.</p></li>\n<li><p>Addressing barriers to conversion as you are ready.  This could include everything from family relations (how you will deal with evangelical parents, for instance) to altering your work arrangements (do you work on Saturdays?) to replacing kitchenware to, possibly, moving.  That's just a sample, not meant to intimidate but just to inform.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you and your rabbi agree that you're ready, going before the beit din (court) for acceptance, going to the mikvah, and (for men) handling circumcision or its replacement.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should not be surprised if the whole process takes a few years.  Rabbis absolutely want to welcome converts but must do their best to make sure it'll \"stick\"; the cost of someone not converting is not nearly as great as the cost of somebody converting and later changing his mind.  The first is a lost (or delayed) opportunity; the second creates a sinning Jew.</p>\n\n<p>Some books you might find helpful to read earlier rather than later in the process are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Conversion to Judaism: A Guidebook</em> by Lawrence J. Epstein (not a rabbi).  This book provides a good, accessible description of the process, key ideas of Judaism, family implications, and more.  It also explains some about the various Jewish movements, which you'll need to be aware of, and includes helpful resources like a bibliography, glossary, list of common acronyms, and so on.  This book is largely overview and nuts-and-bolts stuff.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Pathways: Jews Who Return</em> by Richard H. Greenberg (also not a rabbi).  This book is not about conversion; it's about baalei t'shuvah, Jews who returned to observance.  Sincere converts and BTs have a lot in common both spiritually and with respect to the practical stuff.  This book is a collection of essays written by BTs telling their stories.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Teshuvah: A Guide for the Newly Observant Jew</em> by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz.  This book, too, is aimed at BTs, but it is chock-full of useful advice about making the transition.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've left out of this list many excellent books on specific ideas within Judaism -- God, mitzvot, Shabbat, and so on.  Those are important too, but \"everything you need to know about Judaism\" is way too big a topic for this answer. :-)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, you should also start becoming familiar with our core texts -- the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) for starters.  We read the torah in weekly portions, a few chapters a week.  I recommend that you start reading the weekly cycle and following along with commentaries (e.g. at Aish HaTorah, mentioned by H' Gabriel).  As soon as you can, get yourself a good chumash, which is Hebrew-English edition of the torah broken up into the weekly portions and with commentaries (verse by verse).  Commentaries you want to look for include Rashi (usually marked \"R\"), Rambam (\"M\"), Ramban (\"N\"), Ibn Ezra, Sforno (\"S\").  What do I mean by \"a good chumash\" -- aren't they all the same?  The torah text is the same; what's different is which traditional sources the editors draw on and how much of their own interpretation they add.  For your first one (ultimately you'll likely own several) you want to cover the basics and minimize the modern commentary, so you start to get a grounding in the tradition.  Stone is one good name here; another is edited by A. Cohen; another, if you don't mind a somewhat archaic English translation, is Hertz.  Once you have a rabbi you should get the chumash he recommends.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as soon as you can, get involved with the community.  Go to services; you'll stumble over the Hebrew for a while but it's important to go and start learning to pray, with other people and not just by yourself.  Once you have a rabbi you should get involved with his -- and now your -- congregation; in addition to services there will be adult-ed classes, mitzvah projects, social gatherings, and so on.  Judaism is meant to be engaged with in community, not in isolation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>As Jake mentioned in a comment above, I would say that the first step for conversion is to check out the Noahide movement.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://noahidenations.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://noahidenations.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>If a random Gentile walks up to an Orthodox rabbi and says \"Rabbi, how should I live my life?\"\nThe rabbi won't say \"convert to Judaism\"  Rather, he will likely say, \"Follow the seven laws that G-d gave to Noah; and by extension, to all humankind\"</p>\n\n<p>A Gentile who follows these seven laws has fulfilled 100% of his/her spiritual obligations in the world.  This is the proper path for non-Jews.  </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, unlike conversion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>you don't need to move</p></li>\n<li><p>you can eat in normal restaurants</p></li>\n<li><p>you won't have to change jobs or careers to find a sabbath-friendly one</p></li>\n<li><p>you can marry (or stay married to) 99.7% of the women in the world.  Jewish men can only marry 0.03% of the women in the world.</p></li>\n<li><p>it doesn't take years; you can start right now!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have researched many Noahide websites, and my favorite one is:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://noahidenations.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://noahidenations.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>I wish you great success in your spiritual undertakings, Steven!</p>\n\n\n",

Does the change in the vowel change the meaning of the word? Why did the Mishnah Brurah need to differentiate?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bhol.co.il/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=2785948&forum_id=1364\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a> at Chadrei Charedim, the correct pronunciation (as demanded by the strictures of Hebrew grammar) is with a <i>patach</i>. Indeed, this is true: consider the form of similar phrases that appear throughout Tanakh:</p>\n<p>Genesis 7:1 - בַדור הַזה (<em><b>ba</b>dor <b>ha</b>zeh</em>);</p>\n<p>Exodus 5:23 - לָעם הַזה (<em><b>la</b>'am <b>ha</b>zeh</em>);</p>\n<p>Leviticus 23:27 - לַחדש הַשביעי הַזה (<em><b>la</b>chodesh <b>ha</b>shevi'i <b>ha</b>zeh</em>);</p>\n<p>Numbers 20:5 - אל הַמקום הָרע הזַה (<em>el <b>ha</b>maqom <b>ha</b>ra' <b>ha</b>zeh</em>);</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 4:6 - הַגוי הַגדול הַזה (<em><b>ha</b>goy <b>ha</b>gadol <b>hazeh</b></em>);</p>\n<p>etc, etc.</p>\n<p>In most siddurim, the correct pronunciation is recorded (see, for example, Siddur Vilna). What the Mishna Berurah wrote is therefore puzzling, but is explained by the author of the post at Chadrei Charedim (to which I linked above) as being the result of an unfortunate error.</p>\n<p>The assertion that it should be with a <em>chiriq</em> and not a <em>patach</em> was made by the author of the Mateh Moshe on p.296, §980. I have not seen the original text, but it is apparently riddled with other errors of a grammatical nature, as mentioned at Chadrei Charedim. It was subsequently quoted by the Magen Avraham, who mistook it for having been the observation of Rabbi Shlomo Luria (the Maharshal), since the passage in Mateh Moshe in which it appears commences with a quote that is attributed to him.</p>\n<p>You can see the Magen Avraham's observation <em>in situ</em> (Orach Chayim 676:1), where he falsely attributes it to the Maharshal. The Mishna Berurah appears to have taken the idea from there, although it is truly mysterious why he would have done so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As noted by others, Hebrew grammar calls for a noun (zeman) modified by a definite adjective (hazze) to itself be definite (although there are exceptions in Tanakh).  Thus, \"lazzeman hazze\".  (le + ha- + zeman = lazzeman)  Note that the zayin has a daghesh and the shewa is na` (mobile).  </p>\n\n<p>That is not to say, however, that \"lizman hazzeh\" is ungrammatical.  It simply means something different.  Instead of \"to this time\", it is \"to a time of this\".  It doesn't make sense to me in the context of the berakha, but evidently it did to Mishna Berura.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Eliya Raba copied the MG\"A and the MB (which is explained in Shimon bM's answer). The PM\"G seems not to agree with him but doesn't seem to be sure. The Kaf Hachaim implies that both are correct, but lizman is better. (It could be that he is even quoting the Mate Moshe, the first to choose lizman.)  Both are correct, though, and psukim can be found for either.</p>\n\n<p>The new 'Oz V'hodor' also explains the MB as stated above. Still, the PM\"G is known to be the expert on dikduk, and he quotes another expert on dikduk saying that lazman is correct.\nThe piskai tshuvos brings an impressive list of poskim saying lizman, including the shloh who was before the MG\"A, and also of lazman, including the yaavets. He also brings other sforim who discuss it. He concludes that according to the rules of dikduk it should be lazman. I think, though, that brochos don't always need to follow the rules of dikduk and that there are other examples of this.</p>\n\n\n",

(They are described in Rambam's Hilchos Kiddush Hachodesh, chs. 9 and 10.)</p>\n\n<p>The one that DoubleAA described is called Shmuel's tekufah, and it is the one used for most halachic purposes, including the date when we start saying \"vesein tal umatar\" outside of Israel, and the date of Birkas Hachammah. Its starting point is indeed Tuesday night at 6 PM, but actually the date is 22 Adar of the year 1, which is not the time of the sun's creation. (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=45506&rid=2576\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shmuel agrees with the opinion of R. Eliezer</a>, that the world was created in Tishrei - i.e., beginning on 25 Elul and ending with Adam's creation on 1 Tishrei; on that assumption the sun would have been created on 28 Elul, a Wednesday, and that tekufah would have occurred at 9 AM. Calculating backwards two tekufos, 182 days and 15 hours, gets us back to 22 Adar at 6 PM.)</p>\n\n<p>There is also Rav Adda's tekufah, which assumes that a solar year is exactly 1/19 of a machzor katan (19 Jewish years, containing 235 lunar months). This comes out to 365.246822 days - which is somewhat more accurate than Shmuel's value, but still gains about 4.5 days per millennium, which is why the dates of the Yamim Tovim slowly move later in the secular year. The first tekufah for this calculation is also Tuesday at 6 PM, but a week later than Shmuel's - on 29 Adar (because he holds with R. Yehoshua that the world was created in Nissan). Because R. Adda's year is shorter than Shmuel's, nowadays his tekufah is about 11 days earlier.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Tekufot are the solar equinoxes and solstices. To calculate the tekufa, you must know that the sun was created at 6 pm on Tuesday of year 1 of creation (ie the beginning of the fourth day). The, add 91 days 7.5 hours to get the next tekufah and so on. This number is considered one fourth of a solar year of length 365.25 days. Since a solar year is actually 365.242581 days, our calculated tekufa shifts forward ever so slightly every time.</p>\n\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache%3aFKQucxZDNMsJ%3awww.hakirah.org/Vol%25206%2520Epstein.pdf%20&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgc1cfZY4ud6MdJLFDj2wuSBSNvxLosoC0o3CsXhxb4d4Q58DLUM3I77WdS1cVr59GPkVLt1vj3CVW8y-IE8PdG3Ib7mCYf13aFDCowFDAtYIYfhNHVhWwKWvk_QFQ3JUFv3i23&sig=AHIEtbTu-l85Czc8l5LRua0Va-eVeXaqNQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_year#Mean_tropical_year_current_value\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

He even knew that Yosef was married. From that Rashi:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[My first son was named] Bela because he (my brother) was swallowed up (נִבְלַע) among the nations. </li>\n<li>[My third son was named] Ashbel because God put him (my brother) into captivity (שְׁבָאו ֹאֵל).</li>\n<li>[My ninth son was named] Huppim because he (my brother) did not see my wedding (חוּפָּתִי), neither did I see his wedding (חוּפָּתוֹ). </li>\n<li>And [my tenth son was named] Ard because he (my brother) descended (יָרַד) among the nations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why didn't Binyamin think that Yosef was dead? The brothers had returned with a story that Yosef had been killed by a wild animal, and no one disputed the story. Binyamin wasn't present at the sale to know any differently (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8240/showrashi/true#v12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi 45:12</a>), so why should he think otherwise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>We find that Yitzchak knew by Divine inspiration that Yosef was really alive, but didn't tell Yaakov (Bereishis Rabbah 84:21). Conceivably, then, Binyamin knew too. (In fact, I believe I've actually seen this stated explicitly someplace, but I can't recall where.)</p>\n\n<p>It's also possible that he figured that since, as R. Yose comments in the Midrash there, \"one is not consoled for the living,\" and Yaakov had been in mourning all these years, that indeed Yosef might still be alive.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know, though, that these names really prove that he knew any details of what was happening with Yosef. It would have been logical for him to assume that if Yosef had disappeared but was still alive, that this meant that he had been captured by bandits or whatever, thus explaining Bela's, Ashbel's and Ard's names. As for Chuppim - saying \"I never saw his wedding\" doesn't necessarily imply that there was a wedding for him to have seen; on the contrary, it could mean \"I never saw his wedding\" because there wasn't one.</p>\n\n\n",

Some authorities argue that the disagreement is only regarding an observant Jew, whereas regards a <em>mumar</em> all agree that it is permitted to aid since there is no requirement to keep him from sin (\"אין חובה להפרישו מן העבירה\"). Noda BeYehudah (glosses loc. cit.) opines that any person intentionally commuting a sin is considered a <em>mumar</em>. Others argue that a <em>tinok she'nishbah</em> would not be in this category (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14687&st=&pgnum=42\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lehorot Nattan 3:23</a>, cf. Yabia Omer vol. 2, OC 15). Additional source of issue is Mishnah in Sheviit (<a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%94_%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">5:9</a>). The extent of this restriction is debatable if it applies only at the execution of the actual sin or before as well, whether or not for \"דרכי שלום\" there is leeway and if it applies only to physical aid as opposed to other support (cf. link below).</li>\n<li>Flattery (passive encouragement). The Sefer Yereim (§248), based on Sifre (Numbers, 161), counts flattery as a לא תעשה; Semak also counts it as part of \"showing respect to the great\" (לא תהדר פני גדול) (n. 129). Michat Yitzchak (4:79) comments this is more severe than giving an object with which to commit a sin, although debates of it is a more stringent element of \"סיוע\" (aiding) or it is a separate prohibition of flattery. Maharam Shik (OC §303) holds even passiveness can be considered flattery. </li>\n<li>Being present where a sin is being committed. Later authorities debate if one's presence alone at a place where the environment or ceremony isn't being conducted according to <em>halachah</em> is intself an element of \"חיזוק ידי עוברי עבירה\"; some add \"חשד\" and \"מראית עין\". (cf. link for multiple sources).</li>\n<li>Companionship with a sinner. Sourced in Mishnah Abot (1:7) and elaborated by Maimonides (MT Deot (6:1)). </li>\n<li>Partaking in a feast for an occasion in violation of the Law. As described in BT (Meg. 12a) Jews should not partake in feast set for nefarious events. One reason given is \"חילול השם\" (Tosafot Yom Tov, Yoma 8:7). For a talmid chacham there is the issue that such a feast is not a \"סעודה של מצוה\" (BT Pes. 49a).</li>\n<li>Attendance at a non-Jewish wedding. On the basis of BT (AZ 8a), Shulchan Aruch (YD 152:1) codifies the prohibition of partaking in a wedding of a non-Jew even when eating one's own [kosher] food. Some posit that this prohibition is in place so as to distance oneself from idolatry which in today's day would not necessarily apply (cf. Mishneh Torah, AZ 9:15, Yabia Omer vol. 10 YD 13). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All the above issues, and their various angles, are thoroughly dealt with by the former candidate for Chief Rabbi of Israel, R.

General consensus by the Jewish religious community? Certain kosher standards organizations? Or something else?</p>\n\n<p>The reason I ask is, I've long heard that Jell-O gelatin dessert is not kosher because the gelatin within can be derived from non-kosher animals. However, the gelatin undergoes a chemical separation process that produces a new substance, muddying the waters, such that there seems to be some debate about whether it's truly treif.</p>\n\n<p>Looking into the matter further, the makers of Jell-O gave <a href=\"http://users.rcn.com/sue.interport/food/gelatin.html\">this official explanation</a> in 1998:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Is it Kosher and Pareve?</strong>  </p>\n  \n  <p>\"JELL-O Brand gelatin is certified as Kosher\n  by a recognized orthodox Rabbi as per enclosed RESPONSUM. In addition\n  to being Kosher, Jell-O is also Pareve, and can be eaten with either a\n  meat meal or a dairy meal.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The person asking the question then received a copy of the kosher certification given by 2 Orthodox Rabbis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Included [in this response is a] sheet with a copy of <em>\"The Halachic Basis of our\n  Kashruth Certification of Atlantic Gelatin and the General Foods\n  Products containing this Gelatin\"</em> by Rabbi Yehuda Gershuni & Rabbi\n  David Telsner. The upshot is that since the collagen has been taken\n  apart by the chemical digestion and a new substance has been produced\n  it meets the specifications of the Orthodox Dietary Laws and is Kosher\n  and Pareve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically, they are saying, \"These 2 recognized Orthodox Rabbis, R. Gershuni and R. Telsner, certified our product is kosher and pareve. Therefore, we're putting the 'K' symbol on our product.\"</p>\n\n<p>Is that enough to make something kosher? Who determines the kosher status of \"new\" foods like this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Well, by US law, any manufacturer can put a plain K on its product. That just means \"someone says it's kosher.\" If they put a plain K on a package of bacon, you'd have to sue them for false advertising, unless they could find <em>someone</em> who says bacon is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>As for Jewish law, as new situations come up, rabbis who are regarded as experts on Jewish law address them, going back to prior precedent, as well as a precise conceptual understanding of the laws that can address this case (even if it hadn't been previously addressed). Sometimes there is a dispute among major experts (as has recently been the case with, say, how Jewish law views brain death).</p>\n\n<p>In the case of conventional gelatin, the rulings of major authorities in the Orthodox world was that it's still not kosher. If you start with non-kosher hides (today gelatin can be made from hides; if it's only bones that's a different discussion), and the final product is edible, then the final product isn't kosher. This is the policy of the OU and similar kosher organizations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The answers here address the controversy surrounding gelatin.  However, the question was:   who determines the kosher status of \"new\" foods?</p>\n\n<p>While the vast majority of shomrei kashrus (those who follow the laws of keeping kosher) consume turkey meat today, the kashrus status of this New World bird was a major debate.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turkey/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turkey/</a></p>\n\n<p>Less controversial is the North American Bison.  All agree that this animal (sometimes referred to as the buffalo) has the simanim of a kosher mammal.  The question is, is it a behemah or a chayah?  Must we do ksiui hadam?  Is the back fat considered cheilev (and therefore forbidden to eat)?</p>\n\n<p>I remember hearing that, in practice, kosher bison producers are machmir both ways - they do kisui hadam, as if it were a chayah (but without a bracha), but they do not eat the back fat (which would be classified as cheilev, if it were a behemah).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/buffalo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kashrut.com/articles/buffalo/</a></p>\n\n<p>The most perplexing issues arise from New World starchy vegetables.  For Ashkenazim, the question becomes, which of these vegetables should be considered kitnyios on Pesach, and which should not?</p>\n\n<p>Corn (maize) became kitnyios because of a linguistic error.  \"Corn\" in old English (and other European languages) means any type of grain.  European explorers found this strange yellow cobs growing, and called the stuff \"Indian corn\" (i.e. Indian grain).  When people asked their Ashkenazi rabbis if they could eat \"Indian corn\" on Pesach - the answer was \"of course not!  We don't eat any kind of corn on Pesach!\"</p>\n\n<p>So the New World maize became forbidden, but the New World potato survived the same challenge.</p>\n\n<p>A more recent kitynios controversy surrounds quinoa.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/learn/article/quinoa/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/learn/article/quinoa/</a></p>\n\n<p>So to answer the question - why do some newly discovered foods eventually become commonplace (turkey), and others don't?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it comes down to community standards.  Different qualified poskim will render different decisions on new foods.  Then, the marketplace ultimately rules.  </p>\n\n<p>That is why one finds many fewer \"kosher for those who eat gelatin\" products in Israel today, than a few decades ago.  It's not worth the kosher candy store's effort to buy two different types of gummy worms.  (one with treif-based gelatin, one with kosher fish or plant-based gelatin).  </p>\n\n<p>In some Jewish communities, people serve quinoa salad on Pesach without a second thought.  In other communities, you couldn't have any yom tov company eat at your house if you served quinoa.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, a combination of the plurality of halachic rulings, and the free market in Jewish communities, determine which new foods are acceptable, and which are not. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Consensus of Orthodox Kosher Authorities in America is that gelatine is not kosher.

Did farmers of that time have the practice of fattening up livestock for slaughter, and if you're not going to eat them you feed/graze/herd them differently?</p>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is</strong>: if shepherds were taboo in Egypt, then how to we explain the Egyptian flocks of sheep?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8241/showrashi/true#v34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi (46:34)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כי תועבת מצרים כל רעה צאן:</strong> לפי שהם להם אלהות:</p>\n<p><strong>are abhorrent to the Egyptians:</strong> Because they (the sheep) are their gods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14294&pgnum=219\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siftei Chachamim (46:34)</a> (in his second answer) gives a different twist to the word \"To'evah\", and explains Rashi a little differently. He says that Yosef is telling his brothers that the Egyptians greatly honored shepherds, and in their eyes the shepherds were indistinguishable from the \"gods\" they took care of (and the Torah is using the term To'evah (abomination) to refer to the way the Egyptians treated the shepherds, as if they themselves were gods - since the Torah refers to idol worship as an abomination). Therefore they would settle the family in Goshen, which is the best of the land.</p>\n<p>While he doesn't say it explicitly, it appears the Siftei Chachamim is basing his explanation on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869/showrashi/true#v22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Shemot 8:22</a>, who brings both translations of the word \"To'evah\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/800513/jewish/Interpolated-Translation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kehot Chumash Interpolated Translation</a>, based on a footnote of the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Likutei Sichot Vol. 5, pg. 266, note 23) says as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>for all</strong> non-Egyptian <strong>shepherds are abhorrent to the Egyptians,</strong> for they raise sheep for food, and the Egyptians worship firstborn sheep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the footnote, the Rebbe explains as follows. From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9872/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 11:5</a> we see that the Egyptians only worshiped the first born animal. (Even though it says \"animal\" and not \"sheep\", the Rebbe points out <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8168/showrashi/true#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 4:20</a>, where Rashi explicitly interchanges \"sheep\" and \"animals\").</p>\n<p>Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8238/showrashi/true#v32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 43:32</a>), tells us that Onlekos gives a reason why the Egyptians wouldn't eat with the brothers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>because it is an abomination to the Egyptians:</strong> It is a hateful thing for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and Onkelos gave the reason for the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/u/up0110.htm#1323\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Onkelos says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲרֵי בְּעִירָא דְּמִצְרָאֵי דָּחֲלִין לֵיהּ עִבְרָאֵי אָכְלִין.</p>\n<p>Because the Hebrews ate the sheep that the Egyptians worshiped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Rebbe concludes that the Egyptians problem was with non-Egyptian shepherds, who ate all sheep (including the firstborns, which were worshiped by the Egyptians). The Egyptians ate sheep, except the firstborn sheep, which they worshiped.</p>\n<p>[Based on this, I would say that Egyptians wouldn't eat the meat of non-Egyptians, since it was possible the firstborn sheep were mixed into the meat. Only Egyptians made sure that the meat they ate did not come from any firstborn sheep]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Idol worshipers would buy and sell their gods. For example, Terach, Avraham's father, owned a god-market. It therefore follows that when the Egyptians were faced with starvation, they brought all their possessions, including their gods, to trade in for food.</p>\n\n<p>We see this from the following passage in Beraishis Rabsi (p. 217):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אינו אומר וישמעו אל יוסף ויביאו את מקניהם, לפי שכשאמר להם יוסף הבו\n  מקניכם לא רצו לקבל עד שאמר להם פרעה שיעשו כדבר יוסף. מיד הלכו אצלו\n  וקנה את אלהיהם ואת האדמה </p>\n  \n  <p>...They then went to Joseph and he purchased their gods and their\n  land...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the answer to your question is: they weren't \"shepherds\" in the regular sense of the word, which connotes raising of livestock for profit, but rather \"caretakers\" of the livestock which they viewed as gods.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If \"Toeva\" means \"taboo\", either because of the godlike status of sheep, or vegetarianism, it's indeed very hard to understand how they could have had shepherds (without saying, as answered above, that they kept them for worship or wool.) </p>\n\n<p>However if it was more of a great disdain, perhaps as a reaction to the Hyksos, then it is possible that they would have had low-caste shepherds, (just as our society has IRS agents...). </p>\n\n<p>In addition, as pointed out in a comment, the antipathy might have been directed more against the nomadic lifestyle of the Hebrews, rather than sheep farming itself. (See Hirsch Chumash, Genesis 4:1). If so, they may have farmed sheep in a non-nomadic fashion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why must prophets be wealthy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was studying in <em>Sefer Ha-Aggadah</em> with a chevruta this morning and we came across a passage about prophets having to have certain qualities, including wealth.  I followed the reference to <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=2118\">Nedarim 38a</a>, which quotes R. Yochanan as saying: \"The Holy One, blessed be He, causes His Divine Presence to rest only upon him who is strong, wealthy, wise and meek.\"  He then goes on to say that all the prophets were wealthy and brings proof for four of them: Moshe had the shattered sapphire tablets; Shmuel had a house in Ramah and when he traveled all his household and belongings traveled with him; Amos was the owner of flocks and sycamore trees; and Yonah not only bought passage on the ship but hired the whole ship for 4000 gold dinari.</p>\n\n<p>This passage seems to be talking about material wealth in this world.

God resting his divine presence on someone is different from His granting someone prophecy. (What exactly \"resting His <em>shechina</em>\" means is a discussion in itself. Suffice it to say that Abarbanel believes that it has only occurred once with Moshe and will occur once more with Mashiach.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, R' Yochanan's next dictum, \"All prophets were wealthy...\" in which he learns this from Moshe, Shmuel, Amos, and Yonah is a very different issue than his first saying. This, Abarbanel explains, is not to say that wealth is a <em>prerequisite</em> for prophecy, but rather it is a simple observation that prophecy seems to help in acquiring wealth. That is, prophets, as a result of being the objects of \"God's attention\" in a way, seem to become blessed with prosperity and financial success. (Note that Moshe acquired the precious stones long after he experienced his first prophecy at the burning bush. Shmuel as well, when he experienced his first prophecy was merely a servant to Eli in Shiloh. They only became wealthy much later.)</p>\n\n<p>Just to conclude, Abarbanel believes that <strong>there are no physical or material attributes that are conditional to becoming a prophet</strong>.

Why are we so much more worried of misinterpretation of Kabbalah than Halacha? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First of all the source for this is in Nahar Shalom pg. 34 (140 new edition) by Rabbi Shalom Shaarbi. Also, just want to remind people that I don't want to get into Kabbala here which I always remind people is Asur (see Shut HaRashba 1:414, Yabia Omer 10:23, Yechawe Daat 4:47, Rama Y\"D 246:6, Or LeSion Helek HaTorah, ch. 7 and more). The reason is because the word Kabala means \"receive\" or \"accept\". Therefore, everything that is learned has to be from Eliyahu HaNavi. Halacha is something we call \"Lo Bashmayhim Hi- not in Heaven\" meaning it has nothing do with what the Metziut (fact) is, it is based on Rov - majority or according to some logic. Kabbala is not like that, Kabbala from the Ari is called by the Rashash \"Divre Elokim Hayim- words of G-d that are alive\" (see Eruvin 13b) meaning that they are literally the Metziut. Therefor we must only accept the Arizal because he was appointed by Hashem to transmit Kabala through R' Haim Vital. As I said before, it isn't like Halacha where the decisions are made down here (Lo BaShamyim Hi), but it is \"Divre Elokim Hayim- words of G-d.\"</p>\n\n<p>Please tell me if you need more than this, and precisely what you need.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention, this applies to ALL other Kabalists as well (including Shaare Ora, Chassidus, and all others that don't follow the exact path of R' Haim Vital, Rashash, and Ben Ish Hai.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think this is in regard to the teaching of the Ari, specifically, not Kabbalah in general. The Ari did not himself write down most of his teachings. Several of his disciples did so after his death. One of them was Rabbi Hayyim Vital, whose written versions of the teachings make up what are now generally known as Kitvey Ha-Ari. In the second preface of Rabbi Hayyim Vital printed at the beginning of Etz Hayyim, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דע כי קצת מחברינו כתבו להם ספרים מה ששמעו ממורי זלה\"ה וזולתו על שמו\n  וכולם כתבו הדברים בתוספת וגרעון כפי בחינת הכותבים וידיעתן ובהבנתן\n  הניחו מקום לכמה קושיות לכן אין לסמוך על אותן הספרים וצריך להרחיק מהם</p>\n  \n  <p>You should know that some of our colleagues have written for\n  themselves books of what they heard from my teacher and other things\n  in his name. And all of them wrote with additions and omissions\n  according to the qualities of the writer. And in their understanding\n  of things, they left open space for several difficulties. Therefore,\n  one should not rely on those books and one should distance one's self\n  from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the source is Rabbi Hayyim Vital and the issue is that he felt he was the only accurate transmitter of the teachings of the Ari from among the circle of disciples.</p>\n\n\n",

Although certain Rishonim explain the Gemara (Ibid.) as referring only to details concerning the declaration of Rosh Chodesh, the interpretation of the Ba'al HaMaor (Ibid. 5a in Rif s.v.

Since Yosef was sold as a slave to an Egyptian family, it would cost as much as 3000 silver pieces to redeem him.</p>\n<p>Since 10 brothers played a part in his becoming a slave, each one would have to pay 300 silver pieces.

It probably isn't only Religious Zionists but it seems to be only them. Where did the this minhag come from? I heard live from either Rav Schechter or Rav Gedalya Shwartz that even the Rav (Soloveitchik) and Rav Kook would pronounce the Ashkenazi style. Maybe this came from Rav Nosson Adler (the Rav of the Chasam Sofer) who used to pronounce in the Sefardisha style? This is quite interesting also for some more info. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210507013237/http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=1778&txtSearch=pronunciation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210507013237/http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=1778&txtSearch=pronunciation</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>From personal experience:  </p>\n\n<p>My father pronounced Hebrew like a European, and my mother's father like his Gerer roots.  But then we were sent to local day schools, many of which came into being during a widespread Zionist fervor (religious and not religious)  in the middle of 20th century.  There was a big push by the founders of these schools to institute a Sefardic pronunciation.  While I ended up following my father, just about all of my classmates (and my brother as well) still use a Sefardic pronunciation to this day.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>My Hebrew teachers came from Israel, so they taught me how to read and write Hebrew as Israelis do.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine those schools which do not hire Israelis to teach Hebrew, are also less likely to end up with students who feel a connection to religious Zionism.</p>\n\n<p>However, I was also always taught that the Temani way of pronouncing Hebrew is actually the \"most correct\", and Israeli Hebrew is a mixture of all three, while also simplified to make teaching Ulpan easiest to the most people from the most amount of countries.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From what I know, it's not a Minhag, but a halachic opinion. Let me explain:</p>\n<p>Put frankly, most Ashkenazic pronunciations of Hebrew have many important problems: Ayin and Aleph are usually neglected, soft Tav is pronounced like Samech and Sin, Chet and soft Chaf are the same, the vowels are just messed up in <a href=\"https://defendinghistory.com/intro-ashkenazic-hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">every possible way</a>, and much more.<br />\nMizraħi pronunciation—i.e. traditional Mizraħi pronunciation, which is different from Israeli Hebrew—is simply more accurate, differentiating between all the letters except for Sin and Samech. (A Yeminite dialect whose name I have not been able to find <strong>does</strong> differentiate between the two letters. Any further information would be appreciated.)</p>\n<p>Many parts of the Torah and Tephillah can be twisted in meaning due to mispronunciation. For example, in Shema, the word \"ואהבת\" has emphasis on the last syllable, meaning \"And you shall love.\" However, many Ashkenazim emphasize the second-to-last syllable, which changes the meaning to \"And you loved\".<br />\nAdditionally, in Alenu, there's the phrase \"לתקן עולם\", meaning to <strong>fix</strong> the world. However many Ashkenazim say \"Lessaken Olam\", which means to <strong>endanger</strong> the world! There are only some examples among many others.</p>\n<p>Due to these problems, many Rabbis throughout the past millennium have decided to personally adopt some major aspects of Mizrahi or Yemenite pronunciation, to avoid implying what they don't mean. A significant percentage of the Rabbis who have dealt with this question have ruled that it is even <em>obligatory</em> to attempt to do so (Obviously that ruling isn't widely accepted, but it is quite telling of the issue's validity). See Rabbi Avraham Kook's responsum, Rabbi Ovadiah in <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> and the introduction to the Siddur <em>בית יעקב</em>.</p>\n<p>It could also be that the Rabbis you referenced are attempting to differentiate the letters based on what we know of the Tiberian Hebrew pronunciation, which is the origin of most modern Jewish pronunciations of Hebrew. Traditional Mizrahi Hebrew closely resembles the old Tiberian dialect, except in vowels, where a proto-Palestinian system is used instead.</p>\n<p>Note: || Yes, we indeed know exactly how Tiberian Hebrew sounded. Read Dikdukei Hate'amim by Ben Asher, the last Masorite who officially redacted our system of Hebrew vowels, where he describes exactly how to pronounce Hebrew. Also read Hidāyat al-Qāriʾ, another Masoretic treatise on pronunciation. Also take a look at the first chapter of Sefer Yetzira, various parts of the Talmud (Meghillah 24b is a funny one), and the Ya`vetz regarding his own community's pronunciation.

So I would appreciate if answers incorporated all questions.</p>\n\n<p>The begining of Vayechi is the death of Yaakov.  The rest of Vayechi, are acts and deeds that Yaakov does.  At the end of Vayechi, we are told of the death of Yaakov.   <strong>Why does Vayechi start with his death, to then go on as if he was not yet dead?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the \"paragraph break\", the parsha continues, \"And it was after these things that Yaakov etc..\" <strong>Obviously it can't mean after the death of Yaakov, but it does fit nicely with the ending of Vayigash as we break it up.  <em>So what is going on here?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Rashi says that Vayechi starts with a \"closed parsha\", but does not at all comment on Vayigash ending in the middle of a \"paragraph\" (nor does anyone else)  Yet it's Vayigash that seems to be unique in its \"bizzare\" ending.  In fact, if Vayigash ended with the death of Yaakov, it wouldn't be all that strange to then say 'And it was after these things\", where \"these things\" refer to all of Vayigash.  But now that it is split this way, the parsha makes little sense. <strong>So why does  Rashi, and other commentators only mention this oddity in Vayechi, and not mention it in Vayigash?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19148&pgnum=98\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maskil LeDavid</a> (47:28) discusses how we can know it is a new Parsha. He says that <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0147.htm#27\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 47:27</a> already says <em>\"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt\"</em>. If <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0147.htm#28\" rel=\"nofollow\">47:28</a> was a continuation of the same Parsha, it would have been enough to just start the next verse with \"<em>וַיְהִי יְמֵי-יַעֲקֹב, שְׁנֵי חַיָּיו--שֶׁבַע שָׁנִים, וְאַרְבָּעִים וּמְאַת שָׁנָה.</em>\", since we would already know that Yaakov lived in Egypt, together with all the Jews, mentioned in 47:27. Why repeat the same idea, <em>\"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\"</em>?</p>\n\n<p>So, the Maskil LeDavid explains, why did the Torah repeat \"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\"? To let us know that this is a new Parsha.</p>\n\n<p>It's not until we reach verse 47:28 that we realize that it is a new Parsha. Until then the question doesn't arise, and therefore the commentaries don't mention it until then.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>\"And it came to pass after these things\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0148.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">48:1</a>) is obviously referring to what is recorded before, that Yaakov made Yosef swear to bury him in the Holy Land. (and not referring to the end of Vayigash)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't see any indication in the verses that 47:28 is talking about the death of Yaakov. However, an argument may be made that (at least according to Rashi) the Torah does jump backwards in time between 47:28 and 47:29.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>47:28 places Yaakov in the last year of his life.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rashi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14294&pgnum=222\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to the Mizrachi</a>) to 47:29 interprets \" וַיִּקְרְבוּ יְמֵי-יִשְׂרָאֵל, לָמוּת\" not that Yaakov was actually about to die, but that he would not reach the years of his father.</p></li>\n<li><p>Quoting the Midrash, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8210/showrashi/true#v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi in Bereshit 15:1</a> says that <em>Wherever the term אַחַר is used, it signifies immediately afterwards; אַחִרֵי signifies a long time afterwards</em>. If you want to say  \"<em>a long time afterwards</em>\" means years after, then Yaakov making Yosef swear that he would not be buried in Egypt (47:28) would have had to happen before the 17th year that Yaakov was in Egypt, before 47:27. This is because <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0148.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">48:1</a> says: \"וַיְהִי, אַחֲרֵי הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה, וַיֹּאמֶר לְיוֹסֵף, הִנֵּה אָבִיךָ חֹלֶה\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To address your last question first, many people are confused by what is meant by the phrase \"closed parsha\". The word 'parsha' here does not mean the weekly Torah portion as we commonly call it (which from now on I will refer to as the sedra to avoid confusion), it means a section - what we would call a paragraph. And just as we indicate the beginning of a new paragraph by leaving a gap, the Torah usually leaves a gap between one section and another, but here there is no gap and so it is called a closed parsha.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the previous sedra did not end in the middle of a paragraph, the paragraph finished at the end of posuk (47,27), but the Torah did not put a gap there in order to allude to the closing of the eyes and heart of Yisrael immediately after Yaakov's death, as Rashi explains.</p>\n\n<p>And with regards to the question why the Torah seems to write about the death of Yaakov twice, the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/47091\" rel=\"nofollow\">באר יעקב</a> explains that since it says at the beginning of the sedra \"And Yaakov lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\", and then says \"and the days of Yaakov, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years\", that is, his days and years were now completed, this is the place where the Torah is actually telling us about his death, and thus it is the appropriate place to make the allusion of the closed parsha.</p>\n\n<p>Then afterwards the Torah relates in detail how when his days were drawing near to die he called Yosef and commanded him to bury him with his fathers, and how when he was sick he called to Yosef and his sons and blessed them, and that he blessed all of his sons before he died, because all of this is the details of what he did prior to his death. But the actual end of his days and life was written at the beginning of the sedra.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, he writes, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Capital gain on the sale of private property is included as maaser income, but adjust for inflation when computing the cost. Thus, for\n  example, gains on the sale of a personal residence is maaser income.\n  To adjust the cost basis for inflation, use a cost-of-living index.\n  capital loss on private property can be deducted from maaser income,\n  but it can only count to offset the gain on the sale of private\n  property. For example, if you sell your 5-year-old car at a capital\n  loss versus the depreciated value, you can deduct this loss against\n  your capital gains on the sale of your home. If you have no such\n  capital gains, you cannot deduct this loss against W-2 income as your\n  car (like your home) is not purchased for investment purposes but\n  rather is property held for personal use. Donations of appreciated\n  stock to charity are deducted at the appreciated value for tax\n  purposes and the capital gain is not reported as income. These will\n  appear on your Schedule A line 16.

He really earned $50.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, he said that in England the tax codes allow one to request that part of his taxes go to charity. For example, if one earned $100,000 and must pay $20,000 in taxes, he can tell the government to pay $1,000 to a recognized charity of his choice (I made up the numbers for illustrative purposes).

And from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12760/implications-of-samoa-skipping-a-friday\">this question</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10806/am-i-allowed-to-fly-from-australia-on-motzei-shabbos\">this</a> it seems that it is important that this happens on the correct and accurate time of week.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, how do you know that the Saturday that everyone is using is correct (as in, exactly 7*x days after God's rest day)? Is there any record on who began declaring that Monday is Monday, etc. until it is used by today's civil calendar? And how can we know that the sequence is never broken? (for example, the sequence of calendar time of year was broken when there is a switch from the Julian calendar to Gregorian calendar)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 38)\n\n<p>There is no way to know for certain.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are a few indications that what we have the \"correct\" day.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, there is the halacha that if you do not know what day it is, you keep Shabbat on the 7th day from the last time you kept shabbat.  So even if the calendar did a shift, presumably the Jewish people would have shifted the name of the correct day.</p>\n\n<p>Say, for example that next year the world Calendar people decided to move the week 3 days.  Then from that time on, \"Shabbat\" would be on Tuesday, and not on Saturdays.  In other words, there is no direct connection between Saturday and Shabbat, except for the fact that they currently coincide.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Historically, the first Shabbat was only kept after the Israelis left Egypt, and we are told by Moses that this day is to be the day of rest.  We must assume, but we do not know for a fact, that Moses told us the correct day according to Gd's will.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, even today in Israel, the days of the week are named \"day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six, Shabbat\"  They are not given any other names.</p>\n\n<p>The aspect of your question regarding when Saturday became Saturday, and Sunday, Sunday is a good one for the History stack exchange, but I don't think would be well answered on the Judaism one.</p>\n\n<p>One last point.  In America, some calendars show Monday as the first day of the week, and other calendars show Sunday as the first day.   It is interesting to me, that on a Christian theological level, Monday should be the first day, and Sunday the last day.  Also from a secular, \"business\" perspective, Monday should be the first day and Sunday the last.  However for Jewish people, Sunday being the first day of the week is the most natural. My point here, is to restate what I said earlier, that what name we give the 7th day is not as important as the fact that it is the 7th (i.e. Shabbat)  In Israel, Sunday is a workday and the first day of the week.  </p>\n\n<p>After looking some things up on Wikipedia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week-day_names#Numbered_weekdays\">I noticed that the ISO sets Monday</a> as the 1st day of the week, and Sunday as the 7th.  So indeed the \"world Calendar folks\" have said that the 7th day is Sunday, and yet Jews still keep the 7th day (Shabbat) on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 28)\n\n<p>We do not determine the date of the Sabbath by looking at the calendar and seeing which day is Saturday (or Friday night). Rather (much like my answer to the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12760/implications-of-samoa-skipping-a-friday\">Samoa\"</a> question) the Sabbath is seven days from the previous Sabbath. We have a living <i>mesorah</i>, tradition, on which day is the Sabbath, which happens to coincide with what it commonly known as Friday night to Saturday night. This is one area that illustrates that the observance the Torah commands of us cannot really be reconstructed from the text alone but requires the living community to transmit the practices to the next generation. Nevertheless, this is also a area where there is a fair amount of collaboration since the outside world has its \"traditional\" dating systems which are seldom altered, and when they are it is generally discussed, and discussions exist about when our Sabbath is in comparison with those systems. (Incidentally, Christians specifically consider the day they <i>loosely</i> call the Sabbath to be the first day, <i>not the seventh</i>. They are not disagreeing with what day of the week is the 'seventh'. Since the accuracy of this statement has been challenged in the comments try <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/4\">every single answer (currently) here</a> for example)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=65b&format=pdf\">Sanhedrin 65b</a> (line 24 and further) Tornosrufus asked same question to R.

Akiva answered that there are three proofs that the day Jew think is Shabbos is a real Shabbos.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>River Sebation is very fast on other days and on Shabbos it streams slowly.</li>\n<li>Baal Ov couldn't be applied on Shabbos.</li>\n<li>Smoke comes out of the grave of Tornosrufus's father each day except for Shabbos.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So we can see that, at least at R.

Opinions regarding the time it takes to walk a mil vary from 18-24 minutes, and here we are strict to take the shorter time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The 18 minute mark is almost certainly a mistake. The source of this time limit is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.46a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesaḥim 46a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mishna: [Regarding] ‘deaf’ dough, if there is [a dough] similar to it\n  which has become leaven, it is forbidden. Gemara: What if there is\n  no [dough] similar to it?―Said R. Abbahu in the name of R. Shimon b. Lakish: [The period for dough to become chametz is] as long as it takes a man to walk from <em>Migdal Nunaiya to Tiberias</em>, <strong>which is a mil</strong>. <strong>Then let him say a mil?―He informs us this, [viz.,] that the standard distance of a mil is as that from Migdal Nunaiya to Tiberias.</strong> R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Shimon b. Lakish: For kneading, for prayer, and for washing the hands, [the standard is] four mils.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And later in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.93b.10-11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesaḥim 93b</a> the Gemara states that on an average day one day's journey (from sunrise to sunset) is 40 Roman miles. This would mean that on that 'average' day of 12 hours sunlight the time it takes to walk one Roman mile would be 720 minutes divided by 40 Roman miles. We have thus reached our 18 minutes.. But there's this tiny teeny little problem... the actual distance from what was the area known as Migdal Nunaiya to Tiberias is closer to 6 miles. Manuscript copyists of the Talmud Bavli wouldn't know the actual distance from Migdal to Tiberias, so this is an error that is easy to overlook for long periods of time; especially commentators who did not live in Israel nor knew archaeology might not catch it. Many would claim that this contradictory information isn't a problem and we should side with the Gemara and our commentators. Which is fine.... until you find out the Talmud Yerushalmi disagrees with the Talmud Bavli.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mishna: [Regarding] ‘deaf’ dough, if there is [a dough] similar to it\n  which has become leaven, it is forbidden. Gemara: What if there is\n  no [dough] similar to it?―Said R. Abbahu in the name of R. Shimon b. Lakish: [The period for dough to become chametz is] as long as it takes a man to walk from <em>Migdal Nunaiya to Tiberias</em>, <strong>which is 4 mil</strong>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we have a disagreement to the power of 4, and this is not a reconcileable difference. But hey, at least we are closer to 6 miles. But there are many who would say that we don't hold the Yerushalmi as being authoritative...but then you have variant manuscripts of the Talmud Bavli which don't mention what the actual distance between Migdal to Tiberias is. These manuscripts include the Yemenite copies of Pesahim, and there are more. Unfortunately i don't have copies of these manuscripts on hand, but they would read like the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mishna: [Regarding] ‘deaf’ dough, if there is [a dough] similar to it\n  which has become leaven, it is forbidden. Gemara: What if there is\n  no [dough] similar to it?―Said R. Abbahu in the name of R. Shimon b. Lakish: [The period for dough to become chametz is] as long as it takes a man to walk from Migdal Nunaiya to Tiberias.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If indeed the Talmud Bavli we have is in error, then the most reliable source we have is the Talmud Yerushalmi, which cites the distance as 4 mil. If this is the case, this would mean that you have approx 72 minutes rather than 18.</p>\n\n<p>There are many divergent opinions regarding this topic. The Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Leavened_and_Unleavened_Bread.5.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Chametz 5:13</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As long as a person is busy with the dough, even for the entire day,\n  it will not become chametz. If he lifts up his hand and allows the\n  dough to rest so that [it rises to the extent that] a noise will\n  resound when a person claps it with his hand, it has already become\n  chametz and must be burned immediately. If a noise does not resound\n  and the dough has lain at rest for the time it takes a man to walk a\n  mil, it has become chametz and must be burned immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam rules that as long as you are beating the dough, then even if you're beating it all day long, it will never become hametz. But he does agree with the 1 mil brought down by his manuscript of the Bavli, i don't know if he sources the Yerushalmi.</p>\n\n<p>The RI'AZ is familiar with the statements of both Talmuds, and seems to try and reconcile them both by ignoring the Gemara and Rambam's statements that these times only apply to bread that is left sitting, according to his opinion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dough certainly becomes Hametz after 4 mil (approximately 72 minutes),\n  even if one continues to work it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For more information, including more precise citations of these sources, you can read Efraim Vaynman's article in Hakirah (volume 18): <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol18Vaynman.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Chametz in Eighteen Minutes?

Everything else is considered a masa (load), and may not be carried due to the melachah of hotza’ah (forbidden act of carrying) on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Watches don’t assume the halachic status of jewelry according to most opinions and may not be worn in an area without an eiruv. There’s a minority view that considers a wristwatch a garment, but many poskim reject that position and maintain that it is a keili (device) for telling time. The exception is—according to many opinions—a woman’s watch that is made of gold or is otherwise exceptionally elegant, that would be worn even if the watch stops working.</p>\n\n<p>There are people who are particular not to wear a watch on Shabbos even indoors or in places where there is an eiruv, either because they consider it at odds with the kedushah (sanctity) of Shabbos or due to the concern that they may inadvertently wear it in a forbidden area as well. This is similar to the halachah that we should avoid putting things in our pockets on Shabbos as a precaution against carrying</p>\n\n\n",

Why these four cities? Has there ever been a different count? What are some Nafka Mina (relevant applications) of the status of these cities?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The 4 holy cities correspond to the 4 elements.  Earth (Hebron) because of the cave of the patriarchs, Fire(Jeruselem) because of the temple sacrifices, Water(Tiveriah) because of lake Kineret, Air (Zfat) because it is high in the hills and the buildings being painted blue to keep out the evil eye and the spiritual, airy nature of kabalah which sprouted from the city.</p>\n\n<p>There are some who say that they are reflect 4 temperaments of people, based on those elements, and that people are drawn to each city based on their temperament.</p>\n\n<p>I can only assume that this comes from various statements within the Zohar and the Arizal.  However, the status of the four cities as holy only became \"well known\" in the 1600s.  While Zfat as the holy city of air , is mentioned in 1492. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Holy_Cities\" rel=\"nofollow\">(source wikipedia</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The practical application of these 4 holy cities, is that various predictions regarding the Moshiach is made in reference to them, and Jewish people have asked to be buried in these four cities, even if they lived outside of Israel.  More so than any other places in Israel.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some conjecture on my part.\nI imagine that when coming to Israel in 1492, Tzfat was the only established (read protected) city that the exiles from Spain could return home to.  (It's the only walled city in the north that I am aware of, that was not occupied by various armies and outposts) </p>\n\n<p>Being that the people were Kabalists, and grew great inspiration from the place that they were, they gave it a certain holiness because of their hopes that it would be the beginning of the redemption.</p>\n\n<p>However, knowing that it was not infact a holy city compared to other more important locations. (like nearby Tiveria, or the obvious home of their yearning, Jerusalem) they wanted to create a group of cities which Zfat could be part of.   A group of four cities, each which have a very clear element associated with them would make for good drashot.  And indeed, I have heard some great drashot over the years with this concept in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatviely, it's possible that Kabbalists required that Israel have a representation of each of the four elements within it's borders, and this was the driving force behind them assigning these cities.  The fact that only Zfat on the list has no \"intrinsic\" holiness or meaning,(pre kabbalists moving there in 1492) leads me to the conjecture that I have just stated.</p>\n\n\n",

(See Avodah Zarah 28b and Shabbos 23b, respectively, although in neither place is the expression being used in the sense of \"a practical difference or outcome.\")</p>\n\n<p>However, HodofHod is right: it's definitely not a noun in Aramaic - it's basically an adjectival phrase. So we might analogize it to words from Latin that have become nouns in English (\"omnibus\" and \"virus,\" for example), which correctly use English plurals. So here, the plural would be \"nafka minahs\" (or for Israelis, I guess, \"nafka minot\").</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I posed this question to a tenured professor, whose PhD was in Aramaic Biblical Exegesis, and who is a published expert on several Semitic languages.

The reason for that is the fact that the expression <em>itself</em> is referring to the consequence - encompassing all possible variables - of the comparison being made. In other words, when the text asks \"LeMai Nafka Minnah\", it is asking in parallel English, \"What <strong>IS</strong> the <em>CONSEQUENCE</em> of this comparison,\" which deserves the singular form of the word Nafka, just as it is used so commonly across virtually all Talmudic (and Talmudic-style) analysis I've ever encountered.

Did he keep mitzvos (whether obligated to or not) during that time?</p>\n\n<p>I ask because the Torah says (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9973/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 9:9</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water;\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the Gemara says (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/babamezia/babamezia_86.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Metzia 86b</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Tanhum b. Hanilai said: One should never break away from [the] custom [of the place he is in]. For behold, Moses ascended on High and ate no bread, whereas the Ministering Angels descended below and ate bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This got me thinking: angels are also not (obligated in|capable of) mitzvos. So perhaps Moshe was not obligated to, and didn't, keep mitzvos then, either. Also, there are many mitzvos/halachos involved with eating, e.g. Kiddush, me'ah brachos, seudas Yom Tov (he was up there on Rosh Hashana, so apple in honey too, right? =)). If Moshe didn't eat, does that mean he wasn't fulfilling those mitzvos?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Edit:</h2>\n\n<p>As has been pointed out in the comments and answers, much of the Torah and many of the mitzvos had not yet been given at the time Moshe was on the mountain. </p>\n\n<p>So, to clarify my question: I'm not discussing <em>which</em> mitzvos Moshe was obligated in at that period of time (while not on the mountain). </p>\n\n<p>I wish to know if Moshe kept those mitzvos he <em>was</em> obligated in, as well as if he kept mitzvos that he wasn't (yet) obligated in, as did the Patriarchs.</p>\n\n<p>Even more specifically, <strong>I'm</strong> <em><strong>not</em></strong>  <strong>looking for \"svaros\", but rather for sources in Rabbinic literature that mention or discuss this.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are not obligated in other mitzvot while you are entirely engaged in another one.  However, according to the Rambam the exception is for talmud Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, he was obligated to do any of the mitzvot that he was commanded to do at that time.  However, I'm not aware of any commandments that he missed out on.</p>\n\n<p>Further, it says in Bamidbar that Gd sent a holy angel to help guide the Jewish people through the desert.  Many commentators say that this refers to Moshe Rabeinu, and yet Moshe was still obligated to do his part in the Mishkan, so we see that Humans who are compared to angels are still required to do mitzvot, just as angels that are now human are not required to do mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the gemora says that one should not depart from the Minhag of the place they are in.  However, your question is asking about changing what mitzvot you are obligated to keep or not.  I think its very important (especially now adays) to not confuse Minhag with Mitzvah.  Even if all of the above was not true, Moshe would still be obligated in the Mitzvot he was obligated in, regardless of where he was.  Minhagim, is a different issue all together.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although I have no source, it would seem that since that at the time of Mount Sinai the Torah had not yet been given, the Torah was kept still being kept voluntary like by Avrohom, Yitzchak and Yaacov. The rishonim explain that before Matan Torah one kept the torah voluntary, but if a person felt that he would gain more in avoidas Hashem by not keeping it then he wouldn't have to.

    "content": "# Making a Bracha on disliked foods\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If you, for some reason, must eat food you despise and will gain no enjoyment from it do you still need to make a bracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It may depend on what exactly is the circumstance forcing you to eat this food, and also on whether it is objectively bad-tasting (like bitter medicine) or simply that you personally don't like it.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 204:8 states:</p>\n\n<p>\"All foods and drinks that a person must eat or drink for medicinal purposes - if they taste good and the palate gets enjoyment from them, he must recite the berachah before and after them.\"</p>\n\n<p>To which Rema adds: \"If people compel someone to eat or drink, even though his palate enjoys it - he need not recite a berachah, since he was forced.\" </p>\n\n<p>On the first case, Mishnah Berurah (:43) comments that this is true even if the person has no appetite for them, but is eating them only because he is ill. He adds that if the food is bad[-tasting] and the eater gets no enjoyment from it, then indeed he need not say a berachah. On the second one, he says (:45) that this opinion is not universally accepted - some posekim argue that he should have to recite a berachah in this case, since after all he did enjoy the taste of the food (even if it was under duress).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If the case neither entails healing nor coercion (like the previous answer considered), then it might depend on how much one dislikes the food.</p>\n\n<p>Case 1: You don't like the food, but it isn;t repulsive to you.\nThe first issue to consider is whether or not the requirement to recite a bracha depends on one's personal experience of enjoyment or if it is based on some more objective standard of establishing that the food being consumed is a pleasure giving food. This particular question is not thoroughly addressed in the rishonim or achronim. One can offer a number of speculations within the various rishonim in terms of how objective/subjective they think the obligation of brachos are. \nFor example, the raavya (brachos 35b) states that if one intends to eat something, so long as it is not harmful, they must make a bracha regardless of enjoyment, and even if it is something no one enjoys. However, it seems that most do not accept this chiddush and require some enjoyment, at least by some people, to warrant a bracha. Some rishonim discuss the reverse case: when you enjoy something no one else enjoys. Both the ritva and raah say that your personal enjoyment cannot warrant a bracha (batlah daato). This view seems to be accepted lhalacha (see shulchan aruch 204:4 for an example), however, the reverse case (our case - not liking food people do like) might be different, so it is hard to infer from this (basically, it is possible that something no one eats is not even considered a food, or that eating it might not be considered eating, and your preferences cannot change that reality. This reasoning will not translate over to our case). \nA second issue to consider is what sort of enjoyment necessitates a bracha. Is a bracha only warranted when there is enjoyment of taste? Maybe the nourishment or energy the food provides, even without a pleasurable taste is enough to warrant a bracha. The beiur halacha 204:7 says that one will make a bracha on water (which has no taste) if it aids in digestion of food. This implies that \"pleasure of the stomach\" warrants a bracha even without \"pleasure of the mouth,\" although this issue is considerably debated among the achronim.</p>\n\n<p>Case 2: When one is literally repulsed by the food. This is a three part issue. 1) Like case 1, maybe your subjectivity does not play a role. 2) Like case 1, the energy one gets from the food might necessitate a bracha, even without the enjoyment of taste. 3) Maybe such an experience can no longer even be considered halachically defined as eating. The mishnah brurah (197:28) paskons that if one is so full that they would not enjoy eating any more food at all (they won't even enjoy the taste anymore), then they will not make a bracha. This is a generally recognized halachic category of achilah gassah. Our case is a bit different since you are not in any special category, but simply have a personal preference. Nonetheless, Rav Melamed in pininei halacha thinks that in this case one would not make a bracha. </p>\n\n\n",

Fred can steal the bicycle to enable a quick escape from the pursuer.</p></li>\n<li><p>Fred is in a car whose brakes stop working. The most direct way to avoid crashing into something hard is to intentionally crash into Ernie's fruit stand.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is this action by Fred allowed?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does Fred have to compensate Ernie afterward?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does the likelihood or not of actual death to Fred if he doesn't steal or damage matter to 1 and 2? What if the worst possible consequence is just injury?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does it matter how Fred got into the dangerous situation, e.g. through pure accident, his own negligence, someone else's negligence, or someone else's malice?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>(Inspired by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12897/self-defense-in-a-case-of-ones-capital-not-a-capital-case\">this question</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/629/weekly-topic-challenge-5772-11-week-of-vayigash-5772-violence\">this challenge</a>.)</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is called מציל עצמו בממון חבירו, saving yourself at the expense of someone else's property. Fred is indeed liable to pay Ernie for any damages, even if he was trying to save his own life (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 380:3), and certainly if it was just to save his own property from theft or confiscation (ibid. 292:8 and and 388:2).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Just to back Alex up:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Yes it's allowed. The simple understanding is that the obligation to save a life overrides virtually all commandments, which would include \"don't steal\" or \"don't damage your neighbor's property.\" There is some discussion about this, but that appears to be our conclusion. (Yet the Gemara seems to have debated it; either we conclude it's permitted, or the Gemara was talking of a case where the probability of saving a life was very, very slight.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes, Fred must compensate Ernie. The Gemara says \"don't let your neighbor's ox get lost\" means you have to put effort into saving his property, and therefore certainly you must put effort into saving his life. (So you have to expend <em>gufo</em>, your bodily effort.) When the Torah then says \"don't stand idly by your neighbor's life\", that goes further to require you to <em>rent</em> (\"not just <em>b'gufo</em>, rather <em>l'radya</em>) property to save him (e.g. you have to rent a speedboat, hail a taxi, or whatever). The usual formulation is expending <em>effort</em> or <em>money</em> (\"b'gufo/b'mamono\"), here it's <em>effort or rental</em>, implying you don't have to write off the loss! You send the bill to Ernie.</p></li>\n<li><p>This gets tricky. Again according to some interpretations, the Gemara (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4106.htm\">Bava Kama 60b</a>) records a discussion regarding King David wanting to damage a whole lot of third-party property to increase his military tactical advantage by a small amount. We violate the Sabbath or the like even if there's a one-in-a-hundred chance it will save a life or limb. (But within reason; one-in-a-billion doesn't do it -- there were those who wanted to delay burial 72 hours for the super-rare case that the corpse was actually just in a super-deep coma. Come on already.) At the expense of someone else's property though, that's complicated.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is again tricky, let's try to break it down.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To expose your own life to \"some risk\" to save a person in \"serious danger\" is meritorious, but not required (per Meshech Chochmah). To expose yourself to danger equal to or greater than the person currently at risk is inadvisable. (Of course in the movies the action hero knows that he'll survive the movie, whereas the fellow he's trying to save may die if this is supposed to be a tragic-hero type.)</li>\n<li>If you don't think you'll get the money back, then there's only so much you'd be obligated to spend to do the mitzva of saving a life.</li>\n<li>In some situations, you can save this person today but it will do little. (Maybe you can keep the mob from breaking his legs today, but if you do so tomorrow he'll just rob more from them and they'll kill him.) I'm not sure how that factors into it.</li>\n<li>If someone is trying to do something that's wrong, but is likely to suffer more spiritual effects than they intended, it is <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%98%D7%94%D7%95_%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA\">meritorious, but not required</a> for me to take action to prevent this. (The parallel that first comes to mind is offering a needle-exchange program.) Per <a href=\"http://traditiononline.org/news/article.cfm?id=105386\">Rabbi JD Bleich's \"the case of the poisoned sandwich\"</a>, some rabbis say the same applies to <em>physical</em> damage -- if he wants to do something he shouldn't be, it's not my problem if he falls and breaks his neck. Others would say that you're obligated to protect someone from <em>physical</em> harm (barring the above limitations) regardless. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

On Monday night, of course, he counts as usual with a Beracha. If that night is the 32nd day of the Omer, for example, then he recites the Beracha and counts the 32nd day as usual. <strong>If he is aware when the flight crosses the International Date Line</strong>, and he sees that it is nighttime, (such that it is Tuesday night at his current location,) <strong>he may count the 33rd day with a Beracha</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>If this is too difficult for the traveler, as he cannot precisely determine when he crossed the Date Line, or he is unsure whether it is during the night when this occurs, then he should delay the counting until he arrives in Hong Kong on Wednesday during the day. He should then count the 33rd day without a Beracha, just as one does whenever he misses a counting at night but then counts during the following day. He may then resume counting with a Beracha the next night – the 34th day of the Omer – since he did not miss an entire day of counting.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Similarly, when one travels to the Far East and crosses the International Date Line, he <strong>has the option</strong> of either <strong>counting with a Beracha during the flight, at nighttime, after he crosses the Date Line</strong>, or <strong>waiting until he arrives at his destination during the day and then counting without a Beracha</strong>. Either way, he resumes counting the next night with a Beracha.</p>\n\n<p>When one returns from the Far East, he simply counts in the Far East the night he leaves, and then counts again the next night when he returns home. Needless to say, if, as a result of crossing the Date Line, he returns home on the same day on which he had counted the Omer, he does not count again, and instead waits until the next night.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\n\n<p>One who travels to the Far East during the period of the Omer has the option of either counting the Omer with a Beracha during the flight, at night, after crossing the International Date Line, or waiting until arriving at his destination, during the day, in which case he counts without a Beracha. In either case, he counts as usual with a Beracha henceforth.</p>\n\n<p>this answer has been taken <strong>and</strong> edited from <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2128\" rel=\"nofollow\">DailyHalacha.com</a></p>\n\n\n",

However if I injure myself while doing so, I can't sue him.</p>\n<p>This Gemara appears in the context of the permissibility of one's taking the (civil!) law into one's own hands, if one is <em>positive</em> that one is <em>absolutely correct</em>. (I am adding major disclaimers here -- ask your rabbi before trying this! Please do not get yourself arrested tomorrow and try to show the judge this website!)</p>\n<p>Rambam thus rules (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e102.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Laws of the High Court and the Punishments Entrusted to Them</a> 2:12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש לאדם לעשות דין לעצמו, אם יש בידו כוח:  הואיל וכדת וכהלכה הוא עושה, אינו חייב לטרוח ולהביא לבית דין, אף על פי שלא היה שם הפסד בנכסיו, אילו נתאחר ובא לבית דין.  לפיכך אם קבל עליו בעל דינו, והביאו לבית דין, ודרשו ומצאו שעשה כהלכה, ודין אמת דן לעצמו--אין סותרין את דינו.</p>\n<p>An individual may handle monetary justice himself, if he has the ability -- as he is acting entirely in accordance with the law, he is not required to bother and go to court, even if he would not lose financially by waiting to go to court. Therefore if he did so, then his opponent took him to court, and the court investigated and found that the defendant acted legally -- the courts do not overturn his justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly the Gemara above discusses, effectively, the case of a \"repo man\": if your neighbor has something that is clearly and unequivocally yours, then in theory you could march in and take it back. The Gemara advises, if doing so, to pound on the door first and announce \"<em>I'm here for my car</em>\" (or whatever); if you try sneaking it at night, you could get yourself killed if you're mistaken for a thieving intruder (who we assume would kill the homeowner if the homeowner was about to call the police; as opposed to the repo man who will happily wait till the police show up and explain his case to them).</p>\n<p>So if a Jewish court would demand that Augustine move in this situation, Benny would be allowed to move him. <em>However</em> if Augustine is injured in the process, Benny is liable; and if Benny injures himself in the process (let's say Augustine is just sitting there and Benny gets a hernia trying to lift him) he can't sue anyone. (The above Gemara similarly says if Augustine left a can in the middle of the road and Benny trips over it, Augustine is liable. If Benny goes out of his way to try and break the can but hurts himself in the process, that's not Augustine's problem.) That's often a problem with physical force, very often things don't turn out according to plan. (This is one of the Talmud's concerns with applying \"an eye for an eye\" literally, by the way.)</p>\n<p>The last question would then be whether Jewish law would require Augustine to move. On the one hand, \"hey it's public property so Augustine should be free to stand here.\" On the other hand, \"hey it's public property so Benny should be allowed to walk here.\" If it's clearly a high-pedestrian-traffic area the latter would win out (plunking yourself down in the middle of the street is no different than digging a giant hole in it); if the former, I don't know.  My assumption is there might be some \"loitering rule\" like a half-hour maximum, but that's just a guess.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, from this pasuk, they darshened many names of Moshe, and gave meanings to these names. Since the end of the pasuk says that these are the sons of Bityah bat Pharaoh, they equate Mered with Calev and Bityah as Bat Par'oh, and make each of the names in this pasuk a separate name of the same individual, Moshe.

Simon b. Pazzi once introduced an exposition of the Book of Chronicles as follows: ‘All thy\n  words are one,\n  2\n   and we know how to find their inner meaning’. [It is written], And his wife the\n  Jewess bore Jered the father of Gedor, and Heber the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel the father of\n  Zanoah, and these are the sons of Bithya the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered took.\n  3\n   Why was she\n  [the daughter of Pharaoh] called a Jewess? Because she repudiated idolatry, as it is written, And the\n  daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the river,\n  4\n   and R. Johanan, [commenting on this,] said\n  that she went down to cleanse herself\n  5\n   from the idols of her father's house. ‘Bore’: But she only\n  brought him [Moses] up? — This tells us that if anyone brings up an orphan boy or girl in his house,\n  the Scripture accounts it as if he had begotten him. ‘Jered’: this is Moses. Why was he called Jered?\n  Because manna came down [yarad] for Israel in his days.\n  6\n   ‘Gedor\": [he was so called] because he\n  fenced in [gadar] the breaches of Israel. ‘Heber’, because he joined [hiber] Israel to their Father in\n  heaven. ‘Socho’, because he was like a sheltering  booth [sukkah] for Israel. ‘Jekuthiel’, because\n  Israel trusted in God [kiwu le'el] in his days. ‘Zanoah’, because he made Israel abandon [hizniah]\n  their inquities. ‘Father of’, ‘father of’, ‘father of’: he was a father in Torah, a father in wisdom, a\n  father in prophecy. ‘These are the sons of Bithya whom Mered took’.

Was not\n  Caleb his name?\n  7\n   — The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Let Caleb who rebelled [marad] against the\n  plan of the spies come and take the daughter of Pharaoh who rebelled against the idols of her father's\n  house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is also the derasha in Sotah 12a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when she saw him that he was good.29  It has been taught: R. Meir says: His name was Tob [good]; R. Judah says: His name was Tobiah; R.

However, that rule usually does not apply when the forbidden substance can be made permitted by other means (such as by the passage of time) without loss of quality: דבר שיש לו מתירין אפילו באלף אינו בטל.</p>\n\n<p>There's another rule for \"nullifying\" a forbidden object: Often, if an object becomes segregated from among like objects, it may be assumed to have come from the majority of them, so that if the majority of them are permitted, the one chosen is permitted: כל דפריש מרובא פריש.</p>\n\n<p>Does the exception of דבר שיש לו מתירין, something that can become permitted by other means, apply also to the case of כל דפריש, something segregated from among like objects, forbidding the segregated object if it can (assuming it's forbidden) become permitted by other means?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It's debated by the posekim. In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&pgnum=522\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoreh De'ah 110:7</a> the Mechaber says that \"if a דבר שיש לו מתירין is mixed up with others, and then one of them was eaten inadvertently... all of the other ones are permitted, since we can assume that the issur is gone\" - though he then goes on to say that there are some restrictions, to lessen the chances of eating the forbidden one.</p>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&pgnum=525\" rel=\"nofollow\">110:8</a> Rema writes that \"some say that a דבר שיש לו מתירין cannot be permitted via double doubt\" - i.e., a case such as the Mechaber describes earlier in that paragraph, where issur A falls into bin B, and then one item from B falls into bin C (where normally we would indeed apply כל דפריש, or for that matter plain old ביטול ברוב, and permit it). Shach there (:56-:57) spells out that according to this view, even a \"third mixture\" (i.e., one item from C falls into bin D) would still be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>He further points out that the case in 110:7 is even worse than this one (since there was never anything that was פריש), meaning that Rema would disagree with the Mechaber's position there. Conversely, though, I think we can deduce from Shach that if the Mechaber allows the case where one item disappeared, he'd certainly say the same about a \"second mixture\" (bin C in my example) - whether because of כל דפריש or because of ביטול.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Actually, I see where <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&pgnum=484\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pischei Teshuvah (102:1)</a> deals more specifically with this issue. He says that Sidduro Shel Shabbos, Tzemach Tzedek (Nikolsburg) and Magen Avraham say that כל דפריש doesn't apply in this case, while Tzlach and Chavos Yair say that it does. (Which means, I guess, that they don't necessarily apply the equation that I gave above, between כל דפריש and mixtures of mixtures.)</p>\n\n\n",

Does it depend on Shaos Zemanios? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Re the first response, the halacha as described in Shulchan Aruch 564 is quite different than presented. First, fasts always start at amud hashachar (72 minutes l'chumra, 90 minutes super l'chumra). The only exception is where one fell into a deep sleep with no intention of eating afterward. However, most people either set their clock to davka wake up early, or else hope that they'll wake up early enough to have a bite before the fast starts. In that very common case (possibly 100% nowadays), everyone agrees one may eat. Moreover, the Rema there on 564 says that we always have an intention to drink during the night, so there's no need to make a t'nai (condition) in order to drink if one wakes up unexpectedly early. So even for the machmirim, one can drink right before amud hashachar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://e.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=2399\" rel=\"nofollow\">Minor fast days start at dawn (Alote HaShacar) which is about 72 minutes before the sun rises.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://kehillatisrael.net/hcal/zmanim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">According the Magen Avraham Alot Hashacar is the pre-sunrise event that occurs when the rays of the sun first become evident.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/05-Worship/section-17.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The night ends at \"Alot haShachar\", the \"rising of the morning\".

So I think that's a pretty strong proof that quoting doesn't equal an actual declaration.</p>\n\n<p>With nedarim and shevuos, too, there is also the consideration that they require intent to be valid - \"his mouth and heart have to be in sync\" (Rambam, Hil. Shevuos 2:12 and Nedarim 2:2). So when a person is quoting a formula for a neder or shevuah, he clearly isn't intending to accept it upon himself, and so it shouldn't take effect.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>No sources, just an attempt at logic.</p>\n\n<p>We have a strong tradition of altering divine names to avoid trouble when studying or talking (that is, outside of the situations where we really do want to use those names).

We have no such tradition for quoting people who spoke, either from Tanakh or from chazaal.</p>\n\n<p>Since we could easily have developed such a tradition but we did not, I conclude that quoting somebody, absent the specific intent to make a vow, is not making a vow.</p>\n\n\n",

This would seem to be from the <strong>end</strong> of the meal, for that would be the last meat between the teeth.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's reason is that it is moshech taam befeh. If so, it would also presumably do this from the <strong>end</strong> of the meal.</p>\n\n<p>We Ashkenazim pasken like Tosafot that this is a <em>lo plug rabanan</em> that as soon as the next meal starts, we may eat. Yet as a standardized minhag, we wait various hours. If your minhag is six hours, then that minhag would have developed based on the Rambam or Rashi.</p>\n\n<p>(The Rif understands 'from one meal to the next' as the accepted convention of one meal to the next. If six hours were that division, perhaps that could be from start to start. I'd have to see it inside.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Minhag according to Horav Yisroel Belsky Shlita,Dugel Mirvuva 1, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&pgnum=502\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tamei Haminhagim page 489</a> (footnote, quoting the Zechor L'Avraham), Darchei Teshuva 4, and the Kaf Ha’chaim 9, is that the counting begins when you are finished eating meat and not from when the meal ends. For example, if on Shabbos your done eating meat at 1:30, and the meal (after talking and eating dessert) finished an hour later at 2:30, one begins counting the six hours from 1:30.</p>\n\n\n",

Moshe's response, I heard from a noted Rosh Yeshiva that the optimal (and indeed traditional) authority structure, was a pyramid.  On the bottom was each person's personal rabbi; usually the rabbi of the town.  When those rabbis had questions they couldn't answer they forwarded them to someone they felt was better qualified.

If, however, a person mistakenly ate or drink on a private fast that did not have a specific kabbalah (type #1), he does not need to continue fasting for the rest of the day. Nevertheless, he must fulfill his promise to fast on another day. A fast is only considered to be broken if a person ate at least a k’zayis of food or drank a m’lo lugmov (a cheek-full) of liquid. Some say that one must drink a revi’is to break the fast. According to Shulchon Aruch, if a person mistakenly breaks a private fast that only had a kabbalah during Mincha (type #3), he must continue fasting and does not need to fast another day. Rema, however, maintains that although he must continue fasting, he must also fast another day to make up for the broken fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[שו\"ע תקסח, א, משנ\"ב א, ב, ה, ז ו־ח, וביה\"ל ד\"ה ויש; ביאורים ומוספים דרשו, 2 ו־5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How to do teshuva for mistakenly breaking a fast</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we have learned, a person who mistakenly eats on a public fast day must continue fasting until the end of the day. He is permitted to say Aneinu during his Shemoneh Esreh. He should replace the sentence of b’yom tzom ta’aniseinu with b’yom tzom ta’anis zeh, since he personally did not fast a whole day. It is not necessary to fast for an additional day, since the obligation to fast was pegged to a specific day. Nonetheless, some Rishonim say that as an act of teshuva (for mistakenly breaking his fast) he should fast on a different day. Others say that he should accept a Ta’anis Behab--a set of fasts for a Monday, Thursday and Monday.

This would applies during mincha any day, and shacharis sunday, tuesday, wednesday and friday (however monday and thureday morning even though its better to call up fasters he has a right to tell them they could have leined the normal weekly parsha so he can be called up). the chassam Sofer compares this case in teshuva orach chaim siman 157 to a zimun, where we don't make a non participating cohein mechubad to be mezamein if he is not eating with them (i.e hes eating separately from them) so too a non fasting cohein  goes out the room if not fasting since the torah reading was specifically induced on that day for the fast. even though if one calls up a non faster (who's oneis for health reasons) by mistake we allow him proceed to bless the torah, we still need 3 Fasters who could have been called up. The chasam sofer also says tisha ba'av is a yom tov so even on  a non leining day if its not nidche (delayed) one can call up a non faster (also since hes wearing slippers and doing other forms of aveilus so is included in the fast). </p>\n\n<p>However Aneinu in the repetition of amida as a separate brocho  requires 10 fasters according to shulchan oruch and some poskim allow only 7 or 6 (NOT LESS)in a town with another shul where there are 10 fasters since we include them as one community.</p>\n\n\n",

If you don't have that quorum at the beginning and therefore start doing a regular weekday service, and then more people come in, do you change over?

He rules that if the quorum was established during that time, the Chazzan may recite Aneinu in its proper place. If the quorum was lost during that time, he may no longer recite Aneinu in its proper place, but he may still recite it during Shema Koleinu (blessing 16 of 19) similar to the way individuals do at Mincha.

In short, he says that each of these things should be made up where possible: the chazzan can say Aneinu in his repetition of Shemoneh Esrei (even if there weren't the proper number of people fasting when they had said the silent one), and they should read Vayechal after Tachanun.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure, though, about the case in the second part of your question, where they had already read the weekly Torah portion at Shacharis. Conceivably in that case indeed they wouldn't read Vayechal too, because there are supposed to be only three olim. One possibility might be to read Vayechal without any blessings, although I don't know a source that says so. (If they had only started reading the regular portion - say for example they only read the kohen's aliyah - then conceivably they could then take out a second sefer Torah and divide Vayechal into only the two remaining aliyos, although again I don't have a source for that.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I can not imagine that you would do a fast day service if the community is not fasting, and I can not imagine that you would do a normal week day service if the community is fasting, even though the rest of the nation is not.</p>\n\n<p>Doing otherwise, to me, just shows a complete non-belief in what you are actually doing.</p>\n\n\n",

Alternatively you can hold like the Tzemach Tzedek (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30499&st=&pgnum=447\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 182</a>) that all facial trimming is forbidden, at least miderabanan. (I think this opinion still requires the mustache to be considered one of the 5 corners. See next paragraph.) Both of these opinions appear to be minority ones (in my opinion). Also important is to note the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=389\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch YD 390:1</a> which in discussing the laws of mourning, permits someone during sheloshim to trim his mustache if it is obstructing his eating. Clearly not <em>all</em> mustache trimming is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>In order to forbid shaving the hair of the mustache you have to assume that the implement you are using to cut with is forbidden to use to shave with (certainly a razor blade; possibly an electric shaver). Also you have to assume that the mustache is one of the 5 corners of the beard that we are forbidden to destroy. The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14272&st=&pgnum=80&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tur in YD 181</a> lists two different opinions about what these 5 places are. One opinion, Rabbeinu Channanel's, includes the two \"corners of the mustache.\" The Tur also quotes the Rambam that the entire mustache is not included in the prohibition. It thus seems likely that at least the center of the mustache is not considered a corner.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note the words of the Rosh which are quoted in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9146&st=&pgnum=250&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch YD 181:11</a> that since there are so many opinions about where exactly the corners are, we do not shave anywhere on the beard with an implement that destroys the hair in a forbidden way. I think those words are the strong tradition among Jews and are applicable here as well.</p>\n\n<p>Thus there is certainly room to forbid shaving the mustache with a razor blade (and possibly an electric shaver).</p>\n\n<p>I cannot comment regarding kabbalistic concerns.</p>\n\n<p>[I used the definitions of trimming and shaving brought in the question.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15848&st=&pgnum=93\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> writes that he didn't hear any explicit instructions with regards to trimming a mustache (in the footnote it mentions that the discussion is only when the mustache impedes ones eating, though I don't know the source of this footnote). Moreover, there are logical reasons to forbid as well as to permit. Therefore, he suggests asking Rabbonim who knew what older Chassidum used to do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I heard in the name of the Ben Ish Hai that the mustache isn't allowed to cover the lips because it is Meakev the Tefila. </p>\n\n<p>The Arizal would even trim his mustache so he could eat (Taame HaMiswot pg. 195). </p>\n\n\n",

It must be that G-d shortened his life.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it would appear that the least amount of time that Avraham should have lived would have been 180, since that is how long Yitzchok lived.

The Mishneh Lamelech (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48331&pgnum=145\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Parshas Derachim, derush 11</a>) explains that David was of the opinion that during Avshalom's rebellion he had in fact lost his kingly status (the same view is also recorded in the Yerushalmi, Horios 3:2), so he was entitled to forgive the slight to his honor.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing, then, would apply here, and even more so: when the brothers had harmed him, Yosef was far from being a ruler yet.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably, too (even without considering the question of whether he was a Jewish king), there is the simple fact that a king is defined in halachah - in connection with what kind of animal he brings as a korban chatas for an inadvertent sin - as someone who has no superior other than Hashem Himself (Horios 10a and 11b, and from there in Rambam, Hil. Shegagos 15:9). Yosef, on the other hand, was subordinate to Pharaoh - רק הכסא אגדל ממך.</p>\n\n<p>[Although this isn't really dispositive, since (a) the definition of a king might be different regarding shegagos vs. honor, and (b) R. Yehudah Hanassi asks there whether he would be considered a king for purposes of shegagos (כגון אני מהו בשעיר), and R. Chiya rejects that possibility only because he's subordinate to the Reish Galusa in Babylonia - but doesn't take into consideration the fact that Rebbi is also a subject of the Roman emperor. So perhaps indeed \"a king\" regarding shegagos is defined as the highest Jewish authority, without considering any non-Jewish overlordship.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While David does not take action against Shimi ben Gera, who cursed him in his flight from Avshalom, during his reign, he does tell Shlomo to 'take care' of Shimi ben Gera, toward the end of his life. Shlomo essentially puts Shimi on a sort of house arrest, which he violates, resulting in his death, (See Kings I chapter 2 for the whole incident). He has Yoav, (who disobeyed him at least once from what I remember by killing Avshalom, Samuel II chapter 18), dealt with in a similar way, kings I ch 2 also).</p>\n\n<p>Yosef, when kissing his brothers after hugging and kissing Binyamin, cries, (Genesis 45:15). Yonatan ben Uziel,(ibid) says that he cried because he saw that the brothers would be spread amongst the nations. Yosef also knew that the Egyptian exile was in full swing. I have heard, though I lack a distinct source that our egyptian exile, and perhaps subsequent exiles where at least a partial result of Yosef's sale at the hands of his brothers, and had Yosef held out a little longer, they may not have needed to happen, or perhaps not to the same extent that they did. I will try to find a clear source, but I am assuming that Yosef knew that the brothers' actions toward would have consequences.</p>\n\n<p>I would argue that, in situations where a king is affronted while he isn't really or completely a king, he may be allowed to forgive this affront, or may be required to, but he is still not able to completely let the offending party off the hook. So Yosef forgave the brothers both because he was not yet fully a king when they had sold him, (though he had had the dreams and Reuven had lost the firstborn rights already, presumably passing them to him, see Yonatan ben Uziel genesis 49:3, and because he knew through prophecy that they would in later generations suffer for what they had done.</p>\n\n\n",

Then or during that time, the Anshei Keneset Hagadol (120 people) will be re-established so that they may choose a \"king\".

Thus establishing a state run by Halacha is itself its own mitzvah.

Does everything non-human fall into the \"property, thus financial settlement\" category, or is it more complicated?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Lethal force is only authorized for the civilian bystander to prevent a rape or a murder. Not property damage. This assumes that whoever's attacking my property has a big sign on his forehead that says <em>I'm here just to damage property and I definitely won't hurt any people</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that we acquit someone who kills a home intruder is we assume the robber was prepared to kill the homeowner if needed. One contemporary rabbi actually was home at a time when most people wouldn't be, and found someone breaking in (who beat a hasty retreat). This robber was <em>not</em> prepared to use violence (he figured it would be an empty house), so the rabbi was not authorized to use any force (not that he likely would have anyhow).</p>\n\n<p>Per Alex's answer on the above question, if your animal is attacked by another animal in a neutral space (or it invades your yard), if the only way to save your animal is to damage the attacking one, you aren't held liable. Thus I'd presume property is property. Of course we could have the funny case of a million-dollar throroughbred attacking my, Idunno, sixty-cent goldfish, and some evil genius has constructed a machine whereby if I don't push the button, it kills my goldfish; if I do push the button, it kills the horse; and those are my only two options -- save myself sixty cents, or cost the other guy a million dollars. As far as I know, strictly speaking if you pushed the button we can't charge you -- people panic when their property is threatened -- but I'd strongly assume meta-halacha would recommend that you don't.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The following is from the Mishna (Sanhedrin 8:7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואלו הן שמצילין אותן בנפשן: הרודף אחר חברו להרגו, אחר הזכור ואחר הנערה\n  המארסה. אבל הרודף אחר הבהמה, והמחלל את השבת, והעובד עבודה זרה - אין\n  מצילין אותן בנפשן</p>\n  \n  <p>These are the ones whom you may save with their lives [ie: these are\n  the situations in which you may kill the pursuer]: one who is chasing\n  after one's friend to kill him, [and one who is chasing] after a boy\n  or after a betrothed girl [in order to have sexual intercourse with\n  them, acc. to the gemara].</p>\n  \n  <p><b>However, one who is chasing after an animal</b>, [after] one who\n  violates the Shabbat, or [after] one who worships idolatry - <b>one\n  does not save them with their [the pursuers'] lives</b>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The reason was because his father was an ordinary person, and it is a disgrace to the Torah for a great Torah sage to stand up for someone who is not a Torah sage, and not everybody who might see him stand for his father would know that it was his father.</p>\n\n<p>But Yosef's father, Yaakov, was a great person. However, Yosef was concerned that if he came to his father, his father would want to honor him as befits a king, and to stand before him. Indeed, we see here that when Yaakov was told of Yosef’s imminent arrival, he struggled to sit up. Therefore, Yosef refrained from coming to his father, in order that his father would not need to honor him each time. But on the other hand, he loved for his father to visit him because his father was a great Tzaddik, and it was fitting for Yosef to honor Yaakov by standing for him.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, whenever Yaakov needed Yosef, he would go to him, and not the other way round. But now Yaakov was ill and could not go to Yosef, and so Yosef was forced to go to him. Therefore it says “and it was told to Yaakov: Behold” - Look! something new! - “your son Yosef is coming to you”, something that has never happened before, since Yosef was not accustomed to come to Yaakov.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are Rambam's \"עיקרים\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rambam, in his Commentary to the Mishna (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37945&st=&pgnum=467\">Sanhedrin 10</a>), enumerates 13 \"עיקרים\" or \"יסודות\", which he holds are the core \"principles\" that every Jew is expected to believe. (<a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Theology/Thinkers_and_Thought/Doctrine_and_Dogma/The_Middle_Ages/Principles_of_Faith.shtml\">Summary in English.</a>)</p>\n\n<p>But what are these \"עיקרים\"? Are they axioms in a mathematical sense; a set of statements with which all Jewish beliefs and truths will follow? This cannot be, for certain \"עיקרים\" follow logically from others. For instance the tenth יסוד (God knows the actions of humans and is not neglectful of them) is implied logically by the eleventh (God rewards those who obey the commands of the Torah and punishes those who violate its prohibitions). The fourth יסוד (God existed prior to all else) follows from the first (God exists; God is perfect in every way, eternal, and the cause of all that exists; <em>all other beings depend upon God for their existence</em>). Thus, these \"עיקרים\" cannot be the core of an axiomatic system.</p>\n\n<p>Are they simply what Rambam felt were the most important beliefs in Judaism, regardless of their logical dependencies? This is hard to understand. Why then, would Rambam count the Resurrection as an עיקר (the thirteenth) when it is never explicitly mentioned in Tanach alongside God's unity (the second), which is explicitly stated in a verse that we say twice daily? In other words, it makes Rambam's identification of the \"most important\" beliefs seem somewhat arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>So, in light of the above, my question is: What <em>are</em> these 13 עיקרים? What identifying factor separates them from all other statements that are true according to the Jewish faith?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Ikarim where 13 principles during the time of Rambam, that could be used to differentiate Judaism from Christianity, Islam and other popular beliefs at the time.  During the Rambam's time, religious wars were gaining a status of their own, and the Jewish people were being seen as a religion rather than a nation in exile. These Ikarim were needed to help the Jewish people feel pride and distinguish themselves in the eyes of the gentiles, while also being compatible with them.  Even though Rambam did not live in Christian countries, he still had contact with those Jews, and knew his works would reach them.</p>\n\n<p>An Explanation of how this works with the 13 Ikkarim: (using the translation from your link)</p>\n\n<p>Principle 1\nGod exists; God is perfect in every way, eternal, and the cause of all that exists. All other beings depend upon God for their existence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis establishes the foundation of the religion as being monotheistic, and in line with Christianity and Islam. A point they can agree on.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 2</p>\n\n<p>God has absolute and unparalleled unity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is to separate Judaism from Christianity at the time.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 3</p>\n\n<p>God is incorporeal--without a body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is to give commonality between Islam and Judaism so that Jews are not regarded as a lower status than they already were.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 4</p>\n\n<p>God existed prior to all else. (In a later version of the Thirteen Principles, Maimonides included the notion that God created the world from nothing [creation ex nihilo].)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is in objection to the beliefs of the philosophers.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 5</p>\n\n<p>God should be the only object of worship and praise. One should not appeal to intermediaries, but should pray directly to God.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is to be in contrast to Christianity and superstitions of his day.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 6</p>\n\n<p>Prophets and prophecy exist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is used against Philosophers, to give the basis of the Torah for being the correct books to derive from.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 7</p>\n\n<p>Moses was the greatest prophet who ever lived. No prophet who lived or will live could comprehend God more than Moses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is in contrast to both Christianity and Islam who say the Commandment's of Moses could be reneged.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 8</p>\n\n<p>The Torah is from heaven. The Torah we have today is the Torah that God gave to Moses at Sinai. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis is to give the Jews confidence in the words and laws of Moshe. Perhaps one might think that Moshe was the best prophet, but we have remembered what he wrote wrongly.  This was also an argument against the Kaarites, applied to the Talmud and oral laws</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Principle 9</p>\n\n<p>The Torah will never be abrogated, nothing will be added to it or subtracted from it; God will never give another Law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nAgain, directly against Christianity and Islam.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 10</p>\n\n<p>God knows the actions of humans and is not neglectful of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis would is required to help the Jews feel confident that perfoming mitzvot is not for naught. Also, to prevent people from saying that their intellect is refined but their actions don't have to be.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 11</p>\n\n<p>God rewards those who obey the commands of the Torah and punishes those who violate its prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nPerhaps someone might want to leave the Jewish community and only keep Judaism in private. This resist the claim that they can \"blend in\" with the gentiles and all will be ok.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Principle 12</p>\n\n<p>The days of the Messiah will come.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:\nThis gives the Jewish people the strength to survive in the times of hardship and persecution.

Hence the need for the knowledge postulate as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Several approaches exist to answering this question (which is asked, by the way, in Shut Radvaz 1:334 and the Chosam Sofer in Y.D. 356)</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Classic Academic</strong> approach is to deny the ikkarim's theological importance, and instead see a political one: in order to be granted certain status in Muslim lands, Rambam had to show that the Jews are monotheists and not corporealists. Besides being rather irreverent, this alone doesn't explain all of the principles, but some have elaborated upon this view and shown how the Rambam had political motivations for all 13. As precedence, many point to the <strong>Abarbanel</strong>, in the final chapter of Rosh Amanah, who also states that the Rambam's motivations were largely political. See below. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer HaIkkarim</strong>, as well as <strong>R. Chisdai Crescas</strong> understood foundations to be building blocks of religion, without which the Jewish religion would be incomprehensible. This is how you've understood them in your question, and this is also how <strong>Chosam Sofer</strong> (Shut Y.D. II 273) understood the Rambam's principles. You note the difficulty with this in your question (as does the Chasam Sofer there), but the Rambam does seem to defend this position in some of his letters, and others can be extrapolated from his general philosophy. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Religion requires (1) a perfect, omnipotent God (so that He can be trusted to give us the best possible set of commandments and follow through on them), and to Rambam, logic dictates that only a unified (2) incorporeal (3) and (4) ontologically independent being could fit that description.</p></li>\n<li><p>Religion involves exclusive worship, if you could choose who/what to worship, than you wouldn't be following an obligatory religion. (5) We could only know what God commands of us if we believe in the possibility of prophecy (6), and that the Torah, given by Moses (7-8) is the ultimate (as in perfect), and therefore unchangeable word of God.</p></li>\n<li><p>According to the Rambam, moral and religious responsibility depends on man receiving reward or punishment for his actions, which of course requires God to know those actions (and thoughts). (9-11) Mashiach in particular seems to be a major player in motivation for religious behavior: religion must have an eschatology and work towards some worldly redemption (12). </p></li>\n<li><p>Resurrection (13) may not fit so well, but the Rambam seems to have understood it to be a dramatized version of belief in miracles (which is necessary because religion requires God to be able to be actively involved in human affairs). See \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38246/why-is-resurection-of-the-dead-a-fundamental-of-faith-according-to-the-rambam/38440#38440\">Why is Resurrection of the Dead a Principle of Faith</a>\" for a fuller discussion</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>R. Chaim of Brisk</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_33371_42.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one source</a>, but there are more) is known to have asked a similar question: if a person denies even one letter of the Torah, he is a heretic, so what's the <em>nafka minah</em> (practical difference) between the 13 principles and any other verse in the Torah or Shas? His answer is relevant here as well: a person who denies that, let's say, Moshe Rabbeinu fought Og, would only be a heretic if he knew that he was denying what it says in the Torah. However, if someone had never read the Torah and didn't know that it contained such a story, he would not be a heretic for not believing in it. However, if someone does not know that the Torah/Chazal teaches that God is incorporeal or that there will be a Resurrection, he will nevertheless not be granted a part in the World to Come. </p>\n\n<p>To expand upon this, the great commentaries on Mishna Torah have also dealt with the Rambam's codification of (most of) the 13 principles in Hil. Tehuvah 3:7. Like in the rest of the Mishnah Torah, they provide references as the Rambam's sources, which are all in the context of requirements to being accepted into the afterlife (which is, after all, the context of the Rambam's Hilchos Teshuva as well as the context of the first mishna in Cheilek). Thus, it appears that many classic commentaries understood the principles as nothing more than prerequisites to the afterlife. In fact, the Gemara itself (Sanhedrin 100) asks why Resurrection should be on the list, and answers that, 'if he denies it, he doesn't deserve to get it'. This is also the approach given by Prof. Menachem Kellner in his introduction to Abarbanel's Rosh Amanah, and has since gained popularity in the academic community as well.</p>\n\n\n",

However, it also says that we will be a minority amongst the nations.  So while we may be uncountable, we will remain small compared to other nations of our age.</p></li>\n<li><p>While Judaism is generally understood to be a religion, it is also a nation. Comparing it to the population of Christianity and Islam then becomes an odd comparison, since Christianity and Islam is made up of members from many many nations. Using that standard, the Jewish people have a population in comparable size to other old nations such as Greece, Zimbabwe, or Senegal.</p></li>\n<li><p>Outside of Israel, Judaism has never been a religion that proselytizes. (Tries to convert people)  In contrast, Christianity and Islam try to convert as many people as possible.  In the early years of Islam this was done by waging wars against nations, and with Christianity this was done by missionaries all over the globe.</p></li>\n<li><p>Over the many centuries of Jewish existence, the Jewish people have been the subject of attack and ridicule.  After the destruction of the first temple, the Jewish population was killed off so that only 35% of the population remained. After the holocaust, fully 66% of European Jews were killed. The many pogroms and exiles, as well as various campaigns of forced conversions, has over the centuries greatly reduced the Jewish population.  In comparison, Christian and Islamic conflicts have only ever killed a maximum of ~10% of their population.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>TofeeqAhmad, I appreciate your changes to the question. The answer, however, remains that mass murder and an aversion to proselytizing have prevented much growth. At our very founding, according to our tradition and the text of the Torah, 70 people went down to Egypt as a family/tribe and developed into a small nation within a nation. We grew by leaps and bounds. And then, during the Exodus, only 1/5 came out unscathed. Then, at Mt. Sinai, due to the sin of the Golden Calf (mere months after leaving Egypt), thousands more died. Over the course of the journey through the wilderness, we lost some individuals to war and more were lost to plague.</p>\n\n<p>In the land, there were periods of relative tranquility, during which times there was some growth, but there were also many, many periods of war and exile, during which times the population fell, sometimes dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>Later periods had ups and downs, but once Christianity developed into a full-fledged religion with an empire behind it, there was very little the Jews could do to grow their numbers.

Sustaining us in plenty, means that even when things were good, and the Jewish people were not being forced into otherness by the evils around them, Hashem kept them together and faithful.</p>\n\n<p>\"Times of plenty\" can be referring to the wealth of the nation that the Jews are living in, and not the wealth of the Jews themselves.  Sometimes in history, the host nation would tax the Jews out of all that they owned, making the Jewish people poor.  Despite the wealth around them, the Jewish people felt that they were mainly getting their sustenance from Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways of reading this as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(Answering my own question).

For example, Yechezkel, even though fully four chapters of his book are devoted to prophecies of the downfall of Egypt and its king, never names him as anything other than \"Pharaoh\" or \"king of Egypt\" (though we know from the events as described by Yirmiyahu that they refer to Chofra).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone address the reason for these differences? [If it's because the Torah didn't want to use any of their names, all of which refer to various Egyptian deities, then the same should be true in Nach. But, after all, the Torah seemingly has no problem mentioning other idolatrous personal names of non-Jewish figures, such as the Edomite kings Hadad (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8231#v35\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gen. 36:35</a>) and Baal-Chanan (ibid. v. 38).]</p>\n\n<p>(In a comment, DoubleAA pointed out that the same thing can be asked regarding the Avimelechs of Philistia: they are referred to only by that title in Chumash, and mostly also in Nach; but the one of David's times is usually identified by his personal name, Achish (except in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16255#v1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ps. 34:1</a>).)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>To add to what <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13149/603\">@avi</a> said:</p>\n<p>According to Kabbalah (Zohar, part II, 34a), Pharaoh represents a serpent who sits in the Nile and says \"I created myself and this river.\" This idea comes from a prophecy in Yechezkel (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1229.htm#3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">29:3</a>), where Pharaoh says this. But the Pharaoh in the prophecy is referring to a later Pharaoh, the one that Nevuchadnetzar would destroy.</p>\n<p>The Zohar lumps all the Pharaohs' characteristics together, and says that generally, Pharaoh represents this idea.</p>\n<p>So, as @avi said, Pharaoh represents one Kabalistic concept, which is why all the Pharaohs are just called Pharaoh. If we were to refer to Pharaoh by his name, we would be saying that this Pharaoh was unique and distinct from other Pharaohs.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://theyeshiva.net/Article/View/143/Chabad-Vs-Nietzsche\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To quote the mystical words of the Zohar: “G-d summoned Moses into a chamber within a chamber, to the unique, supernal and mighty serpent… But Moses was afraid. Until this point, Moses had only approached the rivers surrounding the serpent (Pharaoh), and he was scared to approach the serpent itself, because Moses saw how profound its roots were on high!”[5]</p>\n<p>The Zoharic “serpent” metaphor is based on a description of the prophet Ezekiel.[6] Ezekiel defined Pharaoh as “the great serpent who couches in the midst of his streams, who says: ‘My river is my own, and I have created myself.’” To enter into the center of power of this “great serpent,” the man with a mega-ego who insists “I have created myself,” terrified even Moses. How can you overcome a person who considers himself to be a god, the exclusive authority over his own life, the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma,_Vaera.5.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Va'eira, Siman 5</a> also quotes Pharaoh as telling Moshe \"The River is mine and I have created myself\".</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>When no name is given, the lesson and meaning of the story can be expanded for all generations. When a name is given, it is because what is being said is mostly just relevant to the time period that is being discussed, and generalities should not be derived from those verses.</p>\n\n<p>As a quick example.. When dealing with Nimrod, Nimrod has his own special characteristically that allowed him to do what he did, and the fall that happened to him. However his successor had a different personality and ruled differently, and the character traits of Nimrod did not become the character traits of Babylonia forever.  However with Egypt, we are not allowed to ever live in Egypt, and the character traits of the Pharoah, existed for all the Pharoahs.  Egypt becomes a symbol for all the nations of the world that would eventually harm us, or treat us poorly, or cause us suffering. And the leaders of those nations would also be considered Pharoahs to us.    When the behavior and details of a Pharoah did not match that pattern, then a name was given to them, so it would be recognized as not part of the pattern, but rather the behavior of that specific individual.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Joshua Berman writes in his book <em>Ani Maamin</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Exodus account, pharaohs are simply called \"Pharaoh,\" whereas in later biblical passages, Egyptian monarchs are referred to by their proper name, as in Pharaoh Necho\" (II Kings 23:29). This, too, echos usage in Egypt itself, where, from the middle of the second millennium until the tenth century BCE, the title \"pharaoh\" was used alone. (Ani Maamin p.53)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The assertion is that the events of Shemos took place during a period when the Pharaohs were not named, and that later references in the Tanakh occurred after this superstition had receded. See this post that further questions whether this assertion has a historical basis: <a href=\"https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/64177/were-egyptian-monarchs-referred-to-by-the-title-pharaoh-alone-without-using-t\">https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/64177/were-egyptian-monarchs-referred-to-by-the-title-pharaoh-alone-without-using-t</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Egyptian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh#Titles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">titulaturs for pharaoh</a> and Egyptian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_royal_titulary\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">royal titulary</a> changed significantly over time and between dynasties.\nWhat is remarkable in this context is that 'pharaoh' only became used to represent 'king' in the middle of the second millennium BCE. In inscriptions it was often only to be read as 'Horus did this and that', not giving any clue to an actual name. At the same time a superstitious belief manifested itself to not pronounce a holy name.

It informs us also that he [=Jacob] did not rely on his piety: he tried to save [himself] to the extent he could. There's a further hint here for generations: that whatever happened to our father [Jacob] with his brother Esau will happen to us always with Esau's descendants, and it is appropriate for us to hold on to the righteous [Jacob]'s way.

None of this is very detailed, however: none of it says what to give an enemy (or how to do so) in order to appease him, or what military strategy.

The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=5&format=text\">Gemara</a> begins with a Mishna which (according to R' Meir) says that according to a verse both Yoreh [the early rains] and Malkosh [the late rains] fall during Nissan.</p>\n\n<p>R' Nachman asked R' Yitzchak \"How could the Mishna say that Yoreh [rains] falls in Nissan, it [normally] falls in Cheshvan?\" R' Yitzchak answered in the name of R' Yochanan that in the time of Yoel (the prophet) both Yoreh and Malkosh rains fell in Nissan.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara continues with another discussion between R' Nachman and R' Yitzchak (over how could Shmuel age so early, as he passed away at fifty two).</p>\n\n<p>R' Yitzchak said (again) in the name of R' Yochanan that he aged early as a result of his prayer.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then proceeds to tell the story of how R' Yitzchak and R' Nachman were sitting together for a meal. R' Nachman asked R' Yitzchak to say a Dvar Torah (a word of Torah). R' Yitzchak answered in the name of R' Nachman that one isn't permitted to talk in the middle of a meal, as the food may go down the windpipe. </p>\n\n<p>After the meal, R' Yitzchak said in the name of R' Yochanan \"Jacob our Forefather didn't die\" etc.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The sequence of the Gemara seems to be a series of statements from R' Yitzchak in the name of R' Yochanan of how Hashem acts in a miraculous manner with Jews (the first is that the early rains fell out of season and provided Jews with food, and the second is that Shmuel got old as a result of his prayer). </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, R' Nachman asked R' Yitzchak to say words of Torah. He knew the law that one isn't allowed to speak during a meal. However, he thought that the law only applies to saying something secular. However, since Torah protects one from harm, one can rely on that and speak Torah during a meal.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, R' Yitzchak had to explain the ruling of R' Yochanan (that the food may enter the windpipe). Since there was a clear and present danger, one is no longer allowed to rely on a miracle to save him. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here R' Yitzchak said a new concept. Even though Hashem acts in a miraculous manner with Jews (as mentioned in the previous stories), nonetheless, Torah and it's commandments must be kept in a natural manner.  </p>\n\n<p>However, this could be explained in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This rule (that Torah and Mitzvos must be done in a natural manner) is a result of nature. Since nature is also Hashem's creation, Hashem doesn't want it to be nullified without due cause.</li>\n<li>Torah and Mitzvos must affect the natural world. Therefore, they must obey its rules.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The difference between the two ways is that according to the first, Torah and Mitzvos are under \"nature\" and are \"subservient\" to nature (and Torah and Mitzvos must be kept only when it's naturally possible). According to the second way, Torah and Mitzvos in and of themselves are above nature, but they (Torah and Mitzvos) have to be done within nature.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><strong>TL;DR section:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Therefore, one comes back to the question. When R' Yitzchak said \"Jacob our Forefather didn't die\" he meant that since he was of the opinion that the second way was the correct way (to understand the limitation of nature on Torah and Mitzvos), therefore, Yaakov (who represented Torah, and was the choisest of the forefathers) was above nature. Therefore, unlike all other things in the \"natural\" world, he didn't die.</p>\n\n<p>However, R' Nachman was of the first opinion. Therefore, he asked \"did they eulogizers eulogize him ... for naught\"? </p>\n\n<p>His question was not \"how <strong>could they</strong>\" but why would the Torah (which is Truth) write something that was done \"for naught\"? Since it was written in the Torah (that Yaakov was buried) and they were commanded to bury him, the Torah must be under \"nature\" (since the Torah required his burial, even though the Torah says that he is alive, shows that \"nature\" could affect Torah).</p>\n\n<p>However, R' Yitzchak answered \"I am expounding a verse....\" This verse shows that the statement \"Yaakov didn't die\" wasn't referring to his physical life as was seen by the Egyptians. It was referring to his <strong>physical</strong> life as expounded in the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore there is no contradiction (according to R' Yitzchak) how could the Torah command Yaakov to be buried, while at the same time saying that he is <strong>physically</strong> alive. Similar to Torah and Mitzvos, which (according to R' Yitzchak's understanding) are <strong>in essence</strong> above the world, yet their actions must be within nature (and nature \"affects\" truth), so too Yaakov's life, even though in essence he is physically alive, nonetheless, Torah (of truth) required his burial.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14052&st=&pgnum=432\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah Temima on Bereshit 49:33</a> goes through the gemara and explains. The gemara (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=5b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ta'anit 5b</a>) goes through a list of instances where R Nachman would ask R Yitzchak a question and R Yitzchak would give an answer he heard from R Yochanan. In this specific part, R Nachman asked for a dvar torah from R Yitzchak while at a meal. R Yitchak answered that R Yochanan says \"no talking during the meal\" and later gives his d'var torah of Ya'akov avinu lo met. (I'm assuming from the question that you know the rest of the gemara.) </p>\n\n<p>The Torah Temima points out that R Yitzchak's original answer is kinda strange (and rude too, seeing how R Nachman asked for a derasha while at a meal). We talk during meals every day and we rarely suffocate because of it! Rather, specifically in this case, R Yitzchak didn't want to give his derasha at a meal because he wanted to present it in a shocking manner, one which would result in an immediate outcry, and may result in a choking hazard due to the impulse to respond to a shocking statement as R Nachman <em>did</em>. After he made a strong impression with his shocking statement, he gave his pasuk, which most acharonim read allegorically (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37957&st=&pgnum=337\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maharsh\"a</a> and Torah Temima himself). </p>\n\n<p>The statement wasn't actually literal, even though at first it was supposed to seem so, which is why no answer is necessary, yet the question was still valid when asked. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the \"Parshat HaShavua Chat\", <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/2888253#2888253\">I gave</a> Abarbanel's explanation of what R' Yochanan meant when he said that Yaakov did not die. The explanation is that Yaakov, in that the nation of Israel is called by his name still today, did not die, but lives on; i.e. <em>his name</em> lives on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=438\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel there</a> also gives an explanation for the dialogue in the gemara (which he understands was between R' Yochanan and unnamed others). I will summarize:</p>\n<p>R' Yochanan notices that the verse (Bereshis 49:33) says \"וַיְכַל יַעֲקֹב לְצַוֹּת אֶת בָּנָיו וַיֶּאֱסֹף רַגְלָיו אֶל הַמִּטָּה וַיִּגְוַע וַיֵּאָסֶף אֶל עַמָּיו\", but never says the words \"וימת יעקב\" like it does with the other <em>avos</em> when they died, and even Moshe when he died. R' Yochanan therefore said \"Yaakov did not die\", by which he is pointing out this omission in the pasuk, and which he understands as I mentioned above (his name lives on in that the nation is called by his name).</p>\n<p>Now, R' Nachman (or Abarbanel's unnamed others) object: \"But did the embalmers not embalm him, and did his children not bury him?\" R' Nachman did not understand R' Yochanan's intentions and mistakenly took his words literally.</p>\n<p>To this R' Yochanan (or R' Yitzchak) responds. But rather than explain his non-literalism, he instead explains the reasoning and source for the idea that was actually intended with his original statement. That is, this idea of Yaakov's name living on is not really sourced directly from the omision of the phrase in Bereshis 49:33, but rather \"מקרא אני דורש\" — I am deriving this idea directly from another verse [and from there applying the idea as a reason why the verse in Bereshis omitted the phrase specifying Yaakov's death]. The other verse is Yirmiyahu 30:10: (Mechon-Mamre translation)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאַתָּה אַל תִּירָא עַבְדִּי יַעֲקֹב נְאֻם יְהֹוָה וְאַל תֵּחַת יִשְׂרָאֵל כִּי הִנְנִי מוֹשִׁיעֲךָ מֵרָחוֹק וְאֶת זַרְעֲךָ מֵאֶרֶץ שִׁבְיָם וְשָׁב יַעֲקֹב וְשָׁקַט וְשַׁאֲנַן וְאֵין מַחֲרִיד</p>\n<p>Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel; for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The unasked question here is that this verse seems to be speaking directly to Yaakov/ Yisrael as an individual (\"הִנְנִי מוֹשִׁיעֲךָ\" in the singular; \"וְאֶת זַרְעֲךָ\" - \"your descendants\") instead of to the <em>nation</em> as a people. Now, that this verse is addressed to Yaakov even though he is, of course, dead is not a problem. Yirmiyahu has poetic license. But how is he promising that Yaakov <em>himself</em> will be \"saved\", when we know that it is actually the nation of Israel that will be saved?</p>\n<p>The answer is that Yaakov will be saved in that his name will continue to live in the sense mentioned above and not die out by his descendants being assimilated or annihilated. Thus, Yaakov/ Yisrael is saved <em>in that</em> his nation will be saved. He continues to \"live\" <em>in that</em> his nation continues to live. And this is what R' Yochanan (or R' Yitzchak) means by \"מקיש הוא לזרעו מה זרעו בחיים אף הוא בחיים\". So long as his nation lives and continues to be called by his name, he lives on.</p>\n<p>This idea we learn from the above verse in Yirmiyahu, and that is why the verse in Bershis omits the phrase \"וימת יעקב\". This is what R' Yochanan is saying he meant when he said \"יעקב אבינו לא מת\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why don't we seek converts to Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why don't Jews try to convert other people to their religion, outside of Israel? </p>\n\n<p>Since Christian and Islamic forces try to make them a minority shouldn't they also try to convert people to grow larger?  Or is it just that Islam and Christianity originally came from Judaism so there is no need?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Jews have different expectations of non-Jews than other religions have of their non-faithful.</p>\n\n<p>Jews believe that all people are commanded to obey G-d, and His commandments create a powerful and holy connection between Him and each individual. The commandments that apply to everybody are called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah\">7 Commandments of the Children of Noah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There is another, higher level of connection to G-d embodied in [hundreds of] extra commandments which create a stronger and more personal connection to G-d. These are the commandments which apply to all Jews - the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitzvot\">mitzvot</a>. Once you are on this level these mitzvot apply to you <strong>and your children</strong> forever, even if you renounce or ignore them.</p>\n\n<p>To understand how and why this second category arose you will have to do some historical research, but in the present day the point to remember is that Jews don't believe that someone on the first, basic level needs to take on the obligations of the second, higher level. It would be a beautiful, praiseworthy and commendable thing, but because of the more extensive obligations a potential convert is <strong>raising the stakes</strong> in a serious way. If they prove themselves inspired and dedicated to fulfilling the extra commandments then the Jewish courts will accept and welcome them as new Jews, but many conversion candidates have an sadly shallow understanding of what they are taking on. It is better for them to stay as non-Jews than become Jews who transgress and ignore G-d's will for them.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, in general the Jews are happy for the rest of the world to remain as they are. We accept self-motivated converts after extensive study and practice, but we do not seek them out or proselytise. There <em>are</em> institutions and individuals who help non-Jews who want to learn and keep the commandments that apply to them, but as you can imagine the focus has always been on helping <em>Jews</em> learn and keep their own mitzvot.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As usual, there are many answers to this question, all of them are related.</p>\n\n<p>First, let's start with a brief history.  In the time of Abraham, Abraham did try to convert many people.  He did this by having an open tent which allowed people from every direction to come and learn about Gd.  Then, in the time of the Exodus from Egypt, the Jewish people again, accepted any converts who would come to the Jewish people and become part of the nation.  In Jewish tradition these people were referred to as the \"Eruv Rav\" or the \"Mixed multitudes of people\" who did not come from the Israeli tribes, but who saw the miracles that happened in Egypt and wanted to attach themselves to Gd.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, the Eruv Rav was the source of many bad things that the Jewish people did.  Some explain, that this happened because while they were awed and inspired by Gd, they were not truly loyal to the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>Jump forward a few hundred years, and before the time of Christianity, the leaders of the Jewish state, were fighting a war with the Idumeans.  After winning the war, and being tired of the constant fighting over generations, the leaders decided to convince the Idumeans to all convert to Judaism.  They did so, and centuries later, some Jews of Idumean decent (namely King Herod) attached themselves to Rome, became leaders of Israel and were very cruel to the Jewish people.  Again, their loyalty to the Jewish people was questioned.</p>\n\n<p>So Jews in general, do not like mass conversions of people who are joining the \"winning team\".  There is a question of their loyalty to Judaism and the Jewish people.  In other religions like Christianity and Islam, this is not such a big deal, because those are religions made up of many nations, while Judaism is a religion only made up of a single nation.  You can't be Jewish and not be part of the Jewish People.</p>\n\n<p>On another level, we are not concerned about losing many members, or not having enough Jews around.  In the Torah, Gd says not to count the Jewish people directly, or else a plague will come about.  We are also promised that we will be an eternal nation. We will never die out.  Because of this promise, and a general statement that our numbers should not really be counted (except when absolutely needed, like to build community projects or help the poor) there is no concern that we are \"too small\", or that other groups of people are larger than us.</p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of Judaism, we know what is correct and right for our people. We know the Truth, and we are not in competition with anybody else in the world.  We share what we know about Gd and his unity, and about living in a Just society. The rest of the details of how other nations live is not our concern.  As long as people act Justly and Peacefully and don't try to take away our home from us, we let other people live however they wish to live.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To expand on Yoel's answer:  The Jewish people, collectively, are obligated to keep the 613 commandments in the Torah (the books of Genesis through Deuteronomy).  Non-Jews, as Yoel notes, are only obligated (in our view) to observe seven basic commandments given to the sons of Noah.  These include:  A commandment to establish courts of justice and to not permit blasphemy, stealing, forbidden sexual relationships (e.g. incest), murder, idolatry, and eating flesh of living animals.  Not too difficult, unless you like to eat \"Rocky Mountain oysters\" (if you have to ask, you don't) and certain shellfish that are eaten alive.  </p>\n\n<p>So when someone who wishes to convert comes to a rabbi, the rabbi will tell them that being a religious Jew is very difficult, very complicated, and very expensive (showing a conversion candidate a tuition bill for Jewish day schools should be a mandatory warning to every convert).  Also, he will tell them how much hatred is even today still directed at Jews.  He will say:  \"You are not doing yourself any favors by wanting to become Jewish.  If you remain as you are and dedicated to the seven Noachide laws, you will definitely have a place in the World To Come.  But if you convert, you will be obligated to observe the 613 commandments as they apply and you will receive Divine Punishment when you backslide.\"  See Yevamos 47a.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you have a conversion candidate who dismisses these warnings and says something to the effect of: \"I hear what you're saying, Rabbi, but I am not content with just a share in the world to come; G-d has commanded the Jewish people to seek to be holy, because He is holy (Lev. 19:2), and I want that challenge, too,\" then you have a good convert.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Setting aside Shabbat to answer the President's call\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an old <a href=\"http://www.vosizneias.com/98510/2012/01/09/washington-under-clinton-rabbi-gave-lew-permission-to-answer-call-from-president-on-shabbos/\">MSNBC news story</a> about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lew\">Jack Lew</a>, a Shabbat-observant Jew who was just <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=252885\">appointed</a> to be the new White House Chief of Staff, there's a story about his getting a call from President Clinton when Lew was his budget director. It says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lew later consulted with his rabbi, who said that taking an important phone call from the President of the United States would be permissible on the Sabbath under the Talmudic teaching that work on the Sabbath is allowed in order to save a life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've heard similar stories about other highly-placed Shabbat-observers who got special dispensation to take actions on Shabbat that are normally considered forbidden, due to their high positions in government. One example is this paragraph from New York Times (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/18/us/democrats-observances-lieberman-balances-private-faith-with-life-public-eye.html?src=pm\">August 18, 2000</a>) about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lieberman\">Senator Joe Lieberman</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mr. Lieberman, with the help of his two rabbis, Rabbi Al Feldman in New Haven as well as Rabbi Freundel, has derived a way to reconcile the requirements of Jewish law with his responsibilities as an elected official. Jewish law teaches that one may break the Sabbath if the matter involves ''concern for human life.'' Mr. Lieberman and his rabbis have interpreted that by drawing a line between governing and campaigning. That means he will not break the Sabbath to campaign, but he is required to break the Sabbath to cast a Senate vote or take crucial action on public policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is this concept recorded anywhere in responsa literature?</p>\n\n<p>There have been many other Sabbath-observant Jews throughout history in high places in non-Jewish government (although the relatively recent development of instantaneous global communications makes such issues more likely to come up nowadays). I imagine that this issue comes up for many people in the Israeli government, but there could be special reasons that apply to working for the Jewish State that may not apply to any other government.</p></li>\n<li><p>What is the rationale behind applying the doctrine of \"threat to life\" to the actions of people in such positions?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does it really apply, for example, to any \"important\" call from the President to his budget director? Wouldn't the connection between most such calls and any threat to life be very tenuous?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>Summary: Many believe that when it comes to applying halacha on a level that will affect the general public, we must be far more conservative in our concern for the welfare of others. In a modern sense, we would call this an application of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers\">Law of Large Numbers</a>, whereby we are concerned for far reaching cases of pikuach nefesh such as the general economic operation of a country, even though no immediate sense of pikuach nefesh, saving a life, might be apparent.</p>\n\n<p>A start to an answer can be found here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/dat/hilhot-2.htm\">הלכות מדינה כתחום עצמאי - חיים נבון‎</a></p>\n\n<p>In short, many conclude that laws relevant to the general public are essentially different from laws for individuals.</p>\n\n<p>From Rav Kook (משפט כוהן, סי' קמ\"ג)‎:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל אלה ועוד כיוצא בהם הם שרידים שנשארו לנו ממשפטי המלוכה, שהם אינם על פי גדרי התורה של הלכות יחיד. ובמקום אחר בארתי, שגם אלה יש להם מקור בתורה, אלא שדרכי הדרשה בזה נמסרו לכל מלך כבינתו הרחבה</p>\n  \n  <p>These and many others are remnants from the laws of a kingdom [Ed. i.e. a functioning political state], which are not in the bounds of laws of the individual. In other places I've explained, that these too [Ed. laws of a political state] also have a source in the Torah, but rather the rules of interpretation were dependent on the understanding of each king.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A good example given is the following (Shabbat 42):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכבין גחלת של מתכת ברשות הרבים, בשביל שלא יזוקו בה רבים.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>One should extinguish burning metal in the public roadway in order that it will not harm the public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban (ad loc.), expressing the views of the Geonim, explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בהלכות גדולות מצאתי - גבי גחלת של עץ לית בה היזק רבים, מאי טעמא - כמה דלא כביא אית בה סומקא, וקא חזו לה, ולא אתי לאיתזוק בה; אבל גחלת של מתכת, אע\"ג דאזיל סומקא קליא, ולא חזו לה, ואתו לאיתזוקי בה... וכ\"כ ר\"ח ז\"ל כדבריו. ותימה הוא, איך אנו מתירים מלאכה גמורה משום היזק שלא במקום סכנת נפשות. ושמא כל היזק של רבים, כסכנת נפשות חשיב ליה שמואל.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>In the Behag [Ba'al Halachot Gedolot] I have found - regarding burning wood there is no harm to the public, why? If it's not extinguished it will remain glowing red, people will see it and will be careful from being harmed; but burning metal, even though it's slightly red, it's not noticeable, and people will come to be harmed... Rabbi Chananel writes similarly. This is problematic -- how can we permit wholly prohibited work [e.g. a melacha de'orayta] because of concern of harm if it's not a case of fearing for a person's life? [e.g. if it's not pikuach nefesh, saving a person's life, why are we instructed to commit a flagrant melacha de'orayta, Biblical act of work, only to prevent minor harm to the public?]. Perhaps any harm to the public, is equivalent to saving a person's life according to Shmuel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this principle, Rav Shaul Yisraeli permits going to a non-halachically required war (milchemet reshut) for the purpose of preventing financial loss. See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43775&pgnum=146\">עמוד הימיני, עמ' קמו‎</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה שיסוד הדברים הוא שכל מה שנוגע לשלום הציבור או סילוק נזק ממנו, הכל נחשב כפיקוח נפש, כי כל מה שכרוך בשלום הציבור יש בו בעקיפין עניין עם פיקוח נפש. פרנסת היחיד, לדוגמה, אין בה משום פיקוח נפש; אבל אם הציבור יהא מחוסר פרנסה, אפילו אם אין זה נוגע ללחם, הרי לא יימלט שבאחד מבין הרבים יהא כזה שהוא צריך לאוכל יותר משובח, באופן שאצלו זה יכול להיות פיקוח נפש. וכן כל מלחמה שהיא מביאה הרווחה, ועל ידי זה ניתנת אפשרות לטפל יותר בחולים ותשושים, מה שאינו קיים בזמן שהתנאים הכלכליים הם ירודים. וכן מלחמה שהיא להרבות שמעו של המלך, יש להניח שעל ידי זה יפחדו האויבים מלבא, וירבו אלה המעונינים לבא אתו בברית, מה שגם כן מביא למצב כלכלי יותר טוב, ועל ידי זה מתרבה בריאות הציבור. וכן עניין של סילוק הנזק בציבור בעניין הגחלת, אמנם זה מצד עצמו אינו מסוכן, אבל הרי ייתכן שהניזוק לא יוכל לצאת לעבודה, וייתכן גם שהוא בודד ולא יוכל להגיד למישהו שיבואו לעזור לו, ועל ידי כן יכול הדבר הקטן הזה להביא לידי פיקוח נפש. וכיוצא בזה מיני ציורים, שאם אנו חושבים על זה לגבי היחיד הרי זה רחוק, שאין לחשוש מזה; ומכל מקום, באופן ציבורי הרי זה קורה סוף סוף, ולגבי פיקוח נפש גם זה מובא בחשבון.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>It appears that the basis of the matter is that anything related to the public peace or removing harm to the public, is considered 'saving a life', because anything entailing public peace is at least tangentially related to 'saving a life.' An individual's livelihood, for example, is not 'saving a life'; but if the general public will be lacking in livelihood, even if it's not precisely one's bread, it's impossible that there won't be an individual among the public who requires better food, in such a manner that for that individual it could be 'saving a life'. Similarly, any war that brings benefit, and thereby allows for the sick and old to be better cared for, which isn't possible during time of poor economic conditions [i.e. if a war <em>wasn't</em> launched and instead people are afraid of attack from surrounding countries]. Similarly, war whose purpose is to gain 'prestige' for a king, which one can assume will cause surrounding enemies to be more fearful, and surrounding neighbors will be more willing to make peace, which will also bring to greater economic prosperity, and thereby will bring about better public health. Similarly regarding removing something which potentially causes damage to the public like the coal [e.g. burning metal], even if itself is not dangerous, but perhaps it will cause the injured individual from going to work, and perhaps he lives on his own and can't ask for help from others, and therefore perhaps this little thing [e.g. removing the smoldering metal] could bring about saving a life. Similarly many other circumstances, if we think about an individual perhaps the chances are small and we need not be concerned; but in any event, for the public it will eventually happen [e.g. Law of Large Numbers], and therefore we must also consider it as 'saving a life.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, in an article printed in the halachic journal of <a href=\"http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/ASSIA/ASSIA9/R0091164.asp\">Assiya</a>  (הרב מ\"מ פרבשטיין, אסיא נג-נד, תשנ\"ד, עמ' 100‏‎), it is recorded that Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach permitted soldiers to perform non-life saving work on Shabbat. The soldier's job was to understand various transmissions, but wanted to not decipher the ones he assumed were unimportant to 'saving a life', pikuach nefesh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ניגשנו יחד להגרש\"ז לשאול לחוות דעתו, והוא פסק כי החייל חייב לפענח את כל השדרים... למרות שאין כל הבדל בהלכה בין פיקוח נפש של יחיד ושל רבים, ואף על ספק פיקוח נפש של יחיד מחללין שבת, בכל זאת יש הבדל גדול ביניהם ברמת הסיכון הנחשבת לפיקוח נפש... למשל, אנשים אינם נרתעים מנסיעות בין עירוניות, על אף שיש בהן אחוז סיכון מסוים, נניח של אחד ל-10,000. אבל אין כל ספק שראש מדינה אשר ייטול סיכון של אחד ל-10,000 על מדינתו - ייחשב כבלתי אחראי למעשיו, דעל ציבור דרגת סיכון כזו נחשבת לסכנה. ולפיכך פסק הגרש\"ז שעל החייל לפענח את כל השדרים, כיוון שהנידון בהם הוא בטחון המדינה, אף על פי שאותו אחוז של סיכון לגבי אדם פרטי לא היה נחשב לפיקוח נפש.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>We came to Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach to ask his opinion, and he decided that the soldier should decipher all of the transmissions... even though there is no halachic distinction between pikuach nefesh [Ed. saving a life] of an individual or of the public, and even though regarding a doubt of saving a life we still must violate Shabbat, nevertheless there is a great difference between the level of danger that is considered for saving a life... For instance, people aren't concerned about taking an intercity bus, even though there is a certain danger involved, let's say 1 in 10,000. But there is not doubt that a head of state who will take a 1 in 10,000 chance of danger for his country - would be considered irresponsible, because at the level of the public, that level of danger is considered a [true] danger. Therefore Rabbi Auerbach decided that the soldier should decipher all of the communications, because it relates to the state's security, even though the same percentage of danger for an individual would not be considered 'saving a life'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, Rabbi Shlomo Goren, former Chief Rabbi of Israel, permitted the use of Jewish medical cadavers for use in medical schools because in the case of the welfare of the general public we must be concerned about <em>future</em> saving of life, pikuach nefesh, i.e. by training good doctors. (Even though regarding cases of an individual, the circumstance of 'saving a life' must be immediate and at hand.) (הרב ש' גורן, תורת הרפואה, עמ' 235‏‎)</p>\n\n<p>Of interest would also be a collection of articles (650 pages) compiled by Rabbi Shaul Yisraeli and the Eretz Chemda Institute which deals with issues of state and halacha: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/13429\">התורה והמדינה‎</a>; and also the journal <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/?pg=sitemap&CategoryID=169\">תחומין‎</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

See note 47. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Ben Zion Abba Shaul in Shu\"t Ohr Letzion (Chelek 2 Perek 30 note 10) rules that even according to those that hold yesh bishul achar bishul this urn us not problematic. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>This is not to be relied upon for practical halacha CYLOR</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As Rabbi Willig explained it, one factor would be whether or not we are concerned with heating more water already above yad soledet bo.  Another is if this water's temperature is in fact below that (say this water is at 140 F...is that above or below).  There may well be other factors.  Tipping the urn backwards before Shabbat to ensure all water is pre-boiled seemingly does help, and was in fact his advice in this case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. Ovadiah Yosef (Hazon Ovadiah Shabbat vol. 4, 414ff.) rules on this exact type of urn that it is permissible to use.</p>\n\n<p>In presenting the question, he discusses various issues at play that are debatable: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The water in the  tube isn't boiling and therefore when water is released into the main vessel it will be cooked. However ROY dismisses this issue since it is unintentional and unnecessary for the user's purpose (דבר שאינו מתכוין, פסיק רישיה דלא ניחא ליה). Furthermore, the water in the tube isn't cold but rather it's warm, at least, and one can rely on the many authorities who hold that <em>lach</em> (something with fluid) cannot be re-cooked (אין בישול אחר בישול בלח). R. Yitzchok Weiss (Minhat Yitzhak <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1601&pgnum=334\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 10 §28</a>) is more stringent since he maintained that although many permit water to be re-cooked once it reaches the point of <em>yad</em> <em>soledet</em> (hand recoils from the heat), there is still the opinion of Eglei Tal that water must first reach the bubbling point to be considered cooked. Likewise, he suggests that a person <em>is</em> concerned with the water that is released into the vessel (ניחא ליה).</li>\n<li>Pulling the spigot and causing some water from the tube to be released into the vessel is only an act of <em>gerama</em> (causation), which is rabbinically prohibited, and therefore permitted here, vis-a-vis #1, where we are dealing with a rabbinic-level issue altogether. (R. Weiss, ibid., neglects to deal with this factor.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>R. Yosef also cites R. SZ Auerbach (Minhat Shlomo <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47989&st=&pgnum=151\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 2 §34:23</a>) who, in agreement with the first two issues and R. Yosef's position, writes that after investigation found the water in the tube to be almost the same temperature as the water in the vessel and therefore does not present any problem of being re-cooked.</p>\n\n<p>R. Yosef further cites R. Binyamin Zilber (author of Az Nidberu) who permitted usage of this urn, as well as R. Abba Shaul (ref. by @Shoel U'Meishiv).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tu B'shvat Seder\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Where did the idea of doing a Seder on Tu b'Shvat come from?  Why a Seder, not just the eating of fruit?  Why do we call it a Seder if there is no formalized way of doing it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>See on the <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2006/02/is-tu-beshevat-sabbatian-holiday.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Seforim blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are those who claim the custom to celebrate Tu-beshevat as a holiday is based upon the book Hemdat Yamim. This book, according to many, was either written by Nathan of Gaza (Shabbati Zvi's \"prophet\") or one of follower of Shabbati Zvi. (This is contrary to the assertion in the Philogos that Nathan is not author, a contention which has little to no source). In Ha'aretz, an article appeared with this contention, namely the source for the Tu-beshevat custom is Sabbatian or as the headline reads \"The New Year for the Trees, Isn't is Shabbati Zvi.\"</p>\n<p>However, a closer look at the history reveals, that although some of the customs on Tu-beshevat can be traced to Hemdat Yamim the actual celebration dates much earlier. Avraham Ya'ari, the noted bibliographer, in an article traced the history of Tu-beshevat. He explains that much of the early mentions of Tu-beshevat were only in the negative, i.e. one can't fast or say tachanun. Obviously, the first mention is in the Mishna in Rosh Hashana which states, according to Bet Hillel, Tu-beshevat is the new year for trees. The new year does not conotate a New Years like celebration, instead, this only has implications for questions of tithing. One can't tithe fruits from one year using a different years fruits. Thus the 15th of Shevat is the cut off point.</p>\n<p>Ya'ari, however, notes the first mention in connection to a celbration or the like is in the 16th century. Specifically, R. Issachar ibn Susan (c. 1510-1580) in Ibur Shanim, published in 1578 (the book was published earlier, in 1564, this was done without the knowledge or R. Issachar and according to R. Issachar, with numerous errors) he mentions \"the Ashkenazim have the custom [on Tu-beshevat] to eat many fruits in honor of the day.\" Mention of this custom also appeared in a Jedeo-German Minhagim book first published in 1590. \"The custom is to eat many fruits as it is the New Year of the trees.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There might well be the distinction between the eating of many fruits and the formalized seder.</p>\n<p>I would say that the non-formalized way of doing it is that, while there are sources for it and kabbalistically-oriented ways of doing it, the modern adoption of this practice is a reform from people who don't find enough meaning in the rituals we do have, and so they seek to innovate their own. As I wrote <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-i-really-oppose-tu-beshvat-seders.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second issue is the general tendency to adopt new practices, be they hafrashat challah segulas, saying parshas Hamon during Tuesday of Beshalach, or Tu BeShvat Seders. This is somewhat related to the lack of discrimination mentioned above. The rituals we do have do not have enough significance for us, and so we seek to innovate, or adopt, new rituals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sefer Chemdas Yomim from Rabbi Binyomin HaLevi in Tzefas brings down the Seder in the following links</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49705&st=&pgnum=288\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49705&st=&pgnum=288</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49705&st=&pgnum=289\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49705&st=&pgnum=289</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49705&st=&pgnum=290\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49705&st=&pgnum=290</a></p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps I'm naive, but I find it (1) hard to believe it happening in those times and (2) if listed in that manner, was it illegitimate per the state and their inability to wed, or was the baby truly a \"mamzer?\"  I have only 10 such instances out of more than 5300 birth records.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any explanation of this? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Although many translate the word mamzer as \"bastard\", the latter refers to a child born out of wedlock, whereas the definition of mamzer is much narrower.</p>\n\n<p>A mamzer is the child of a couple who engaged in a biblically forbidden relationship.  Namely, a married woman sleeping with a man other than her husband, or two people sleeping together who are immediately related (parents, children, siblings, siblings-in-law).</p>\n\n<p>The child of a single Jewish woman and a man is NOT a mamzer.  </p>\n\n<p>The child of a Jewish woman who was a niddah at the time of conception is NOT a mamzer.</p>\n\n<p>I don't speak German or Hungarian, but if those terms meaning \"illegitimate\" mean to label this child as a bastard, that does not mean that the child is a mamzer.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we must be absolutely certain who both the mother and father are of any given child, for that child to possibly be a mamzer.</p>\n\n<p>Our cyber chassidic friends at askmoses have a list of sources.

    "content": "# Unusual number of males among the 70 who went to Egypt\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/T0146\"><em>B'reshis</em> chapter 46</a> lists the seventy descendants of <em>Yaakov</em> who went to Egypt. It actually lists sixty-nine: let's assume <em>Yocheved</em> was the seventieth, as <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%A2%3a%D7%A8%D7%A9%22%D7%99_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%95_%D7%98%D7%95\"><em>Rashi</em> explains</a>. It also lists (in <em>pasuk</em> 12) two who died before the trip down, so there are a total of 72 descendants of <em>Yaakov</em> listed. Of these, three are female: <em>Yocheved</em>, <em>Serach</em>, and <em>Dina</em>. Assuming a 50% chance of having a boy at each birth, the probability of such a disproportionate number of babies of one sex is about 0.000000000000003%. What's going on?</p>\n\n<p>(And if you want to say there were females not listed (besides <em>Yocheved</em>), then you have to explain why the Torah says there were seventy (do the females not count?) and why it lists some females and not others. That's even if, as suggested in an answer, there are <em>dead</em> females not listed: the Torah lists dead males, after all.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This link discusses this question at length. \n<a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/9-parsha/13vayigash.rtf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/9-parsha/13vayigash.rtf</a></p>\n\n<p>Rash\"i mentions (to answer for the opinion that there were girls born along with each of the sons of Ya'akov) that there were more females but they all died before going to Egypt. However, we are left with the implication that only those named and counted were part of the descending party. (. . which entails that all of Ya'akov's sons married Egyptian women, making it not remarkable when an Israelite man married an Egyptian woman later in the Torah, among other technical difficulties!)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the number 70 is used not [only] as a census, but as a qualitative description of Ya'akov’s family for the purpose of comparing it in its totality to the nations of the world, which also comprise 70. (cf. D’varim 32:8-9) The reason Rash\"u <em>et al.</em> were compelled to give an explanation for the absence of many females was that the inclusion of Dina and Serach indicated that women were being counted, despite the general rule that only males are counted when the Torah records census data. The burden of explanation is really on the inclusion of these two women, not the exclusion of all the others.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, an alternative [to the null hypothesis] to explain their inclusion could be that the Torah wanted to add up to exactly 70, while fitting the pattern of each wife - Le'a and Rachel - having exactly twice the number of offspring as her slave - Bilha and Zilpa. These specific members of the family were chosen from among all the other females due to their special merits, as attested in the <em>midrashim</em>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>What's the problem? I know families with multiple generations of mostly (or all) boys. There's a family that comes to mind with something like 6 brothers who are mostly married, and there are now between 4 and 6 sons to each of those brothers. In all, the grandfather has about 24 or 25 grandchildren. If I'm not mistaken there is one granddaughter among them.</p>\n\n<p>I also have family with similar rates.</p>\n\n<p>It's not like it can't happen.

The same seems to be assumed in other questions and especially <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12095/5\">a couple of</a> different <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/3241/5\">answers</a>.  But is that right?  I always thought the purpose of the Berachah was primarily (or at least partially) for Eretz Yisrael but that the reason for waiting to recite it was so people returning from their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage#Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'Aliyah LeRegel</a> would not be met with a deluge preventing their return to their homes abroad.

Why Jews who live in Europe or Australia or Hawaii, follow the weather in Bavel instead of their own location is something I've never understood.

The reason given (Mishna in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=10&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 10A</a>) for why we wait 15 days after Sukkot, until the 7th of Cheshvan, is in order to ensure that the last travelers can pass the Euphrates River before the rain comes (Rabbeinu Gershom) and makes the river difficult to pass (Rashi). </p>\n\n<p>Once the 7th of Cheshvan comes, all the travelers have left the land of Israel, and Israel can start praying for rain.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then continues to tell us that outside of Israel they wait until 60 days after the Tekufat Tishre to start the prayer for rain. Rashi says that this is because Bavel is a low place and therefore doesn't need as much water. Rashi later says that we (the rest of Chutz LeAretz) follow the customs of Bavel. The Mishna Berurah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">117:1:5</a>) says the same thing.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/8/117/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav 117:1</a> brings an alternate opinion brought by the Rosh. This opinion questions this and says that while it is true that we follow the customs of Bavel, this is only on matters of Halacha, not when we need rain. Every region should therefore start praying for rain whenever they need it.</p>\n\n<p>This opinion was not accepted by anyone, even the members of the Rosh's synagogue (see @DoubleAA's comments). See there for more details.</p>\n\n<p>If a small area needs rain before the 60th day of Tekufat Tishre, they should add the request in the silent Amidah during the Shomeah Tefillah blessing. </p>\n\n\n",

However, as an aid to making his great compilation well-arranged and complete, he prepared in Arabic a list of the 613 commandments before embarking upon his enterprise. He provided this propaedeutic because he had his own ideas, which differed from those of his predecessors, on the nature of the laws which ought to be included in the 613.

(The tshuvah is focused on non Jewish names.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Qafih</a> z\"l published an article about this in Sinai (70: p. 197) entitled <em>Anyone Who Does Not Speak Hebrew Correctly Violates a Negative Commandment</em> (trans. my own). To summarize the article:</p>\n\n<p>The Sifrei (Deut. 11:19) derives from the words “you shall to teach them to your children, that they speak them” that when one’s child begins speaking he should teach him Hebrew and Torah.</p>\n\n<p>This does not appear to be a mere asmakhta (rhetorical flourish), but rather a halakhicaly empowered derasha, as implied by Tosefta (Hagigah 1:1) that a minor who knows how to shake, shakes the lulav, one who knows how to wrap himself is obligated in tsitsit, one who knows how to speak—his father teaches him Shema, Torah, and Hebrew. The juxtaposition of speaking Hebrew together with these other Biblical commandments implies that it too is a full-fledged obligation.</p>\n\n<p>A very similar statement is found in the Sifrei Zuta (Numbers 15:38).\nIn a similar vein Rambam writes in his commentary to the statement in Avot (2:1) that one should be careful with a minor mitzvah just like a major mitzvah, that examples of the latter are circumcision, tsitsit, ritual slaughter, and Passover. Examples of the former include rejoicing on holidays, and learning Hebrew. One again, the juxtaposition strongly implies that this is a fully binding obligation.</p>\n\n<p>R. Qafih understands that according to this passage the obligation is Biblical. He explains Rambam’s omission of this in SHM and in MT as reflecting the view that the biblical commandment to master/speak/teach Hebrew (the three seem to get conflated) is included in the broader commandment to learn Torah.\nHe adduces support from this from the Palestinian Talmud (Succah 3:12) whose text states that when a child learns to talk, his father teaches him the language of the Torah. The emphasis on Hebrew being the language of the Torah, implies that this study is auxiliary to the study of Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, R. Qafih states that according to the Sifrei, Tosefta, and Rambam in PHM, anyone who does not learn Hebrew, or who learns it but does not speak it, violates a positive commandment, wheras according to the Palestinian Talmud, and Rambam in MT, the obligation to speak Hebrew is included in the obligation to learn Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he cites R. Saadya Gaon’s commentary to Leviticus (10:1) that interprets Nehemiah (13:24) as referring to speaking a corruption of Hebrew intermixed with foreign languages as being improper; indeed, sinful. The next verse speaks of these individuals being struck.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, R. Qafih concludes that according to Rasag one who speaks a corruption of Hebrew receives prophetically mandated lashes.</p>\n\n<p>His concluding ruling is that anyone who does not learn Hebrew or who knows it but does not speak it violates a positive commandment, while anyone who speaks a corruption of it, or speaks without care for grammar, receives 39 lashes.</p>\n\n\n",

Is the anointed one/prince the Messiah? If so, does that mean the Messiah is to die (be cut off; and be no more)? And how does one interpret the 70th week in this chapter?  </p>\n\n<p>I know it's a lot of questions, but hopefully it can be treated like one big question hehe. If it must be broken down into several smaller questions, please let me know and I can do so.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I suggest you read the end of <a href=\"http://www.jews4judaism.org/jewsforjudaism/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=368%3atestimony-of-scripture&catid=72%3ascriptural-studies&Itemid=408\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> by R' Yisroel Blumenthal. The content is intended to be anti-missionary, but nonetheless gives the interpretation of Jewish commentators. (Note that rarely is there actual consensus among Jewish commentators to the Bible, especially with interpretations of vague visions such as this one, but in this case the one that is offered is, I think, a common one, and one that has not been proven wrong by the Messiah not arriving at a predicted year.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead of posting the entire thing here, I will respond to your specific questions in light of the interpretation presented there:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All \"weeks\" are periods of seven years. The seventy weeks are divided into the first seven and then the following sixty-two weeks. (Numbers are rounded by week.) Thus, the sixty-two weeks in 9:25 is actually part of the seventy mentioned immediately before it. The first seven \"weeks\" are from the \"going out of the word\" of Jeremiah, when he prophecied about the rebuilding of Jerusalem until the reign of Cyrus, when said prophecy was able to be realized. The remaining sixty-two week period is from that point until the second Temple was destroyed, during which the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt (although not to the point of its former glory).</li>\n<li>The \"anointed one\" in 9:25 is different from the one in 9:26. The former refers to Cyrus and the latter to the last <em>kohen gadol</em> (high priest) to serve in the second Temple.</li>\n<li>The last week referred to in 9:27 is the last week of the sixty-two week period mentioned above. The verse describes the events of those seven years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.digital-brilliance.com/contributed/Karr/HekRab/HekRab.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">HeiKhalot Rabbati</a>, R.

Among the commentators mentioned are Ibn Ezra, Rashi, and Abarbanel.  In a nutshell, the seventy weeks are viewed as 490 years and terminate with the destruction of Jerusalem in the last seven years of that period.  The 'anointed one' of v. 26 is Agrippa, according to Ibn Ezra and Rashi. (Rashi's commentary is accessible in English translation at 'Tanakh with Rashi' [chabad.org]).

This kind of confuses me because I thought Jews were Hebrew, but then again, I don't know too much. But basically I'm asking where I can find the most original form of the Hebrew Bible/Tenach (are these the same thing? Looking for the collection of 24 books.)? I would like two forms of resources, if possible, please: An <strong>actual book</strong> (in English, since I can't copy+paste the text into a translator >_<) as well as a <strong>good online resource</strong> (online bible/tanach). Not looking for a \"Jewish translation\", because as said in that link \"translation is a form of interpretation\" and I don't want an interpretation. I want the real thing :)</p>\n\n<p>PS - Sorry if my lack of knowledge makes my questions horribly worded.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Hebrew Bible and the Tanach are the same thing. Most of the books were written originally in Hebrew and a couple were written at least partially in Aramaic. Whether the text we have today is the same as it was originally is subject to dispute. (With regard to non-Pentateuch books, most everyone agrees our text is not 100% the original.) However, the differences between different texts are very few and hardly matter.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most accurate versions of the Masoretic text is the Koren Tanakh, available to be purchased <a href=\"https://korenpub.com/koren/intusd/tanakh/tanakh-bible/classic-compact-tanakh\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. (I believe it has textual variants listed in the back.) The most prominent online resources are <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechon-Mamre</a> and <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikisource</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what confused you about \"There are many different Jewish translations of the Hebrew Bible\". The Tanach has been translated into many languages many times. If you were to compare English translations produced by Jews, then I have no doubt that you would find yourself very confused. Each translator has their own view and interpretation to which they bias their translation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while there are different opinions about the \"Best translation\", there are also different opinions about the \"original text\".</p>\n\n<p>The hebrew text you will find in most Tanachs today is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Masoratic Text</a>.  (It means \"Traditional Text\")  This text was corrected between the 7th and 10th centuries, as various communities were found to have slightly different texts from each other.   The differences in the texts are minimal.  However during the 2nd century there were a group known as the \"Tikun Sophrim\" which means Scribal corrections.  The corrections were needed because of the events surrounding the destruction of the Temples and the scattering of the Jewish people.  Texts from the Dead Sea scrolls show slight differences in the text dating back between 150 BCE and 70 CE.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as for translations, the first officially approved one that Jews use is called \"The translation of Anokoles\" which was written in Aramaic.  Since then there have been many translations based on the country in which various Jews have lived, as well as depending on the commentators used to understand the Hebrew.  The Current Artscroll translation for example relies heavily on the commentary of Rashi for it's translation.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the translations and texts available to us, really do differ on very minor things, but it should also be clear to everyone that the text has been corrected over the many centuries in exile.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>An original Tanach in Hebrew is available on <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">machon-mamre</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A translation is available on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/732/shmuel-brill\">chabad.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

However, there are those who do discuss symbolic meanings in these practices, so the book I'm wondering about would be based on their teachings. For example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\">R' Hirsch</a>'s commentary on the Torah makes repeated and consistent reference to many such symbolic elements.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that such a book could be very useful when studying these areas in particular. People tend to treat them as rather esoteric, partly because they're mostly not in practice currently, and partly because they deal with essentially spiritual causes and effects that aren't obviously connected to natural phenomena that we're familiar with. With the sort of dictionary that I describe at one's side, one could analyze a complicated procedure, or even a hypothetical complicated procedure in the Talmudic debates, in part by breaking it down into its constituent elements and analyzing what each one is taken to symbolize.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>While this isn't <em>exactly</em> what you're looking for, it's close: the Rama's <strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/35870\">Toras Ha'Olah</a></strong>, which does go through just about every mitzvah/halakha in Seder Kodshim and explains the reasoning for their details in a super-cool-scientific-mystical way.

This question was posed on the basis of the original view.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Shulchan Aruch (108:7) allows one to recite a Tefilat Nedava in a certain case, <a href=\"http://www.mishnaberura.com/Default.asp?ChelekID=1&SeifID=361\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halacha Berura</a> (22nd question on this page) writes that one should not do so, because nowadays we do not allow reciting a Tefilat Nedava unnecessarily. </p>\n\n<p>If a woman’s maariv is Tefilat Nedava, it seems that it should not be said?</p>\n\n<p>Even if it is not Tefilat Nedava, davenning is not a simple thing. Various kavonnos are needed. I will mention HaShem’s names many times. Since women are not obligated to daven, perhaps they should not. Do we have sources for this issue to help me CMLOR?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Yalkut Yosef (106:1) says that a woman's primary obligation for tefillah is to daven Shacharit. He permits women to daven Mincha or Arvit if they're unable to daven Shacharit. If a woman wants to daven all three tefillot, she is permitted to as well.</p>\n\n<p>He mentions that the reason for permitting this is that davening is asking Hashem for mercy (תפילה בקשת רחמים היא). It seems to me we are not concerned that saying a tefillat nedavah would be a beracha she'ainah tzricha or beracha l'vatellah, even though today when we don't allow someone to daven a tefillat nedavah (except where the halacha recommends it as a technique to avoid a safek about a mistake in tefillah). </p>\n\n<p>Yalkut Yosef mentions (106:3) that most Ashkenazi women daven Shacharit and Mincha, but not Arvit (because they never took on the obligation of Arvit). The Mishnah Berurah (106 s.k. 4) also rules this way. They doesn't discuss whether Ashkenazi women are permitted to daven Arvit despite being patur, but I've seen generally Ashkenazim are more permissive of women making berachot that only men are obligated in than Sefaradim are, so lacking evidence to the contrary, I'd assume that Ashkenazim also allow women to daven Arvit, even though they generally don't.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It is not a Nedavah; it is a Reshuth. There is a difference. What that difference is, I actually do not know well enough to articulate it.</p>\n\n<p>I have also heard, in the name of RJB\"S, that he felt both men and women ought to (how strong that \"ought\" is also unclear to me) Daven three times a day.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>there is no reason a woman can not daven maariv. halacha does not go according to rashi who says women may not to those things which they are not obligated to do b/c of spefic time requirements. perhaps when doing so it would be best not to consider it for themselves a fixed obligation b/c of the principle of maalin bakodesh vein moridin for the times they will not be able to or forget</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is fear of Hashem known as Yiras Shamayim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I often see that when people discuss fearing Hashem they refer to it as \"Yiras Shamayim.\" Why is it called \"Yiras Shamayim\" and not \"Yiras Hashem\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Partly a comment on DoubleAA's answer, and partly an independent answer:</p>\n\n<p>It is true that in general we find Chazal avoiding the use of Hashem's name where possible, and using alternative terms instead like (Hebrew) \"shamayim\" or \"hamakom,\" or (Aramaic) \"rachamana.\" We also don't find them using any of these terms as commonly as we use \"Hashem\" - for example, the expression \"brich Rachamana\" (corresponding to our \"baruch Hashem\") appears only eight times in the Gemara, and I've found only one example that might correspond to our \"im yirtzeh Hashem\" - in Sanhedrin 98a (אם ירצה אדון הזה, see Rashi there, although I think other commentaries explain it differently).</p>\n\n<p>[I once saw in one of R. Avigdor Miller zt\"l's books (don't recall which one) that this reflected the lower level of closeness to Hashem that they enjoyed as compared to the era of Tanach (when we find people using His name constantly, attributing events to Him, greeting each other with \"May G-d bless you,\" etc.). In this connection he cites the statement in the Gemara, Yoma 69b: \"Since they knew that Hashem is truthful, they wouldn't act falsely towards Him\" - and explains that therefore the sages of the era of the second Beis Hamikdash and later wouldn't use terminology that would falsely imply a clear perception of His presence.]</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, at some later point in Jewish history it became more common to use the term \"Hashem\" to refer to Him, and to do so more often. (The importance of using phrases such as \"baruch Hashem\" got a <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/bsht/kst/3/60\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">particular boost</a> through the efforts of the Baal Shem Tov, though of course the expression long predates him.) So it may simply be that the phrase \"yiras shamayim\" is common enough in the Talmudim and Midrashim that it stayed \"fossilized\" in that form, whereas as it became more common to bless Hashem for events in the course of casual conversation, people naturally would use the more familiar term.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azriel_Goldfein\">My Rebbe</a> explained that fear of Hashem is not terror of His power over us, but rather awe at how far above us He is. We express that distance by referring to Shamayim which is literally and figuratively unreachable. Thus, Yiras Shamayim is awe and admiration of Hashem's unknowable greatness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The phrase yiras shamayim shows up many, many times in Talmud era writings, even in conjunction with verses from the Bible that specifically use the phrase yiras Hashem (see  <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot 8a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>My best guess is that it is used to avoid saying God's name. We choose the euphemism of \"Shamayim\" as an allusion to the verse in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94%3a%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90_%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yonah 1:9</a></p>\n\n<p>ויאמר אליהם עברי אנכי ואת יקוק אלהי השמים אני ירא אשר עשה את הים ואת היבשה:</p>\n\n<p>And [Jonah] said to [the sailors] \"I am a Hebrew, and it is the Lord, God of the Heavens [Shamayim], the maker of the land and the oceans whom I fear.\" (my translation)</p>\n\n\n",

His response</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the siyum formula at the end of Tanakh or a book of midrash etc, I use the regular one, but say the name of the book instead of the name of the Massekhet. Indeed, in the one volume mishnayot, Berlin, 1924 which I inherited from my father Rabbi Noah Golinkin zl, at the end of every Seder there is a siyyum text which is very similar to the standard text for the completion of massechet of Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://schechter.edu/which-books-may-be-studied-in-order-to-hold-a-siyyum-responsa-in-a-moment-volume-3-issue-no-10-july-2009/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">online responsa</a> he cites the following sources permitting a siyum on books from Tanach</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shlomo Kluger (Responsa Ha’elef Lekha Shlomo, Bilgoray, 1931-1932, No. 386) allowed a siyyum on one of the Books of the Prophets on Passover Eve on the condition that the person studied this book for its own sake. However if he studied it with the intention of doing a siyyum, he cannot do a siyyum over it. On the other hand, if one learned a lengthy Tractate of Gemara with the intention of doing a siyyum, this is permissible because of the nature of learning. However, R. Kluger does not bring any proof for this distinction; it is simply his own logic.<br />\nMoshe Feinstein (Responsa Igrot Moshe, Part 1, New York, 1959, No. 157) allows a siyyum on a biblical book if it was studied in depth “According to the true meaning, which is according to one of the commentaries of our Rabbis the Rishonim”. He bases himself on the Gemara in Bava Batra 121b with the commentary of the Rashba and the Nimukei Yosef ad loc. that one can do a se’udatsiyyum after completing every great mitzvah. But this source is doubtful and it is difficult to base oneself on it alone (see Golinkin, pp. 89-90).<br />\nGedalia Felder (Yesodei Yeshurun, above, V, 2,  pp. 52-53) also allows a siyyum on a biblical book, basing himself on the sameGemara in Bava Batra 121b, Shir Hashirim Raba (above I, 1) andResponsa Ḥavat Yair (above III, 9).  Indeed, the last two sources can serve as a basis for this custom. R. Elazar (or R. Yitzḥak) spoke about the siyyum of the Torah which resembles the conclusion of a biblical book and the author of Ḥavat Yair allows asiyyum on any sefer learned by a group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Melachim 12:2</a>) writes that one should not over-contemplate the events that are to come about with the redemption, for the prophecies are intentionally vague and no one will know for certain their meaning until they come to be realized. Even the Rabbis of the Talmud only said about the redemption and the Messiah what they could glean and derive from the verses of the Prophets, but did not have any sort of absolute knowledge or tradition as to what would happen.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=52&format=pdf\">Succah 52a</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=52b&format=pdf\">52b</a>) does mention a figure known as \"Mashiach ben Yosef\", and does interpret a couple of verses in Zecharia in light of his existence. (In doing so, it is made clear that he will die in the apocalypse.) Who is this figure? It is not exactly clear.</p>\n\n<p>R' Saadya Gaon (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31359&st=&pgnum=180\">Emunot V'deot 8:6</a>) seems to believe that his existence is only necessary if the Jews are not ready for the Messiah and need to do <em>t'shuva</em> to merit the redemption. [It is a common idea that the Messiah will come either if the Jews are meritorious, or if they are not, at a predetermined \"deadline\". R' Saadya is referring to if the Messiah must come at the \"deadline\", and the Jews need preparation to be redeemed.] In this case, the Mashiach ben Yosef will lead the Jews back to God's good graces allowing them to be worthy of redemption, and later he will die in battle (of Gog and Magog), allowing for the succession of the \"real\" Messiah, Mashiach ben David.</p>\n\n<p>Abarbanel and Malbim, in their commentaries to the Prophets, treat the existence of Mashiach ben Yosef as a \"kabbala\" (tradition) known to Chazal from the prophets themselves. (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14369&st=&pgnum=560&hilite=\">Abarbanel to Ezekiel 32</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39980&st=&pgnum=209\">Malbim to Ezekiel 37:19</a>.) In their opinion, he will be (as indicated by his name) from the tribe of Yosef, or at least from one of the ten \"lost tribes\", who were exiled by Sancheriv. He will be instrumental in uniting the ten tribes with the rest of the Jews in exile, as well as uniting the Jews in exile themselves, and leading them in the final war leading to the Redemption, thereupon dying in battle.</p>\n\n<p>According to some sources, Mashiach ben Yosef will be resurrected immediately after the war in the \"Techiat Hameitim\" (Resurrection of the Dead). Others maintain that he will remain dead so as not to detract from the monarchy of the Mashiach ben David.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabad.org/library/moshiach/article_cdo/aid/101747/jewish/Appendix-II.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad has a nice write-up</a>, but they caution:  </p>\n\n<p>\"In view of the divergent Midrashim and interpretations on this subject it is practically impossible to present a more definitive synopsis that would go far beyond the above.

Joseph will translate the new Torah by Urim and Thummin.

Maaseh Hakorbanos 3:14</a>). Since \"in the place where they do semichah they slaughter it, and semichah should be immediately followed by slaughtering\" (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam ibid. :12</a>), then indeed that would be the usual practice. (Although Rambam goes on to note that it's not essential that these two actions follow each other directly, so possibly the position of the animal's head isn't indispensable either, so long as it's standing on the north side of the mizbe'ach.)</p>\n\n<p>The part about what direction its head vs. hindquarters face, though, does seem to be mentioned specifically only about the tamid and the kohen gadol's bull (<a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=994&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoma 3:8</a> and <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam, Hil.

Conceivably they might indeed have tried to do this with all korbanos (and for the same reasons), but there might have been constraints on doing this when lots of korbanos were being offered at once (whereas, by contrast, the tamid and the kohen gadol's bull were the only korbanos being offered at their respective moments).</p>\n\n\n",

I note a few examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gen 23:02. On p. 243, note 2, “Most versions of the text treat [Hebrew phrase]… as a heading, leading commentators to question why it is on these specific words that Rashi raises the issue… If [Hebrew phrase] is viewed as a heading, Rashi’s choice of these words to introduce his comment about the juxtaposition can be explained as follows…”</li>\n<li>Gen 26:14. On p. 286, note 1, “Rashi appears to be defining only the word [Hebrew word]… Why then does he include the word [Hebrew word] in the headings?”</li>\n<li>Gen 33:18. On p. 381, note 7, “Thus Rashi places this comment regarding Jacob’s escape from Laban and Esau under the heading “Upon his coming from Paddan-aram” and not under the heading “And Jacob came intact.”</li>\n<li>Num 20:17. On p. 244, note 1, “The text, which includes… 'etc.' in the title, follows virtually all contemporary editions. Consequently, most of the super-commentaries on Rashi understand his comment as an explanation of the phrase “we shall not veer right or left,” which Rashi indicates with “etc.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The notes also sometimes mention the correct headings without saying that Rashi wrote them, e.g. at Gen 37:02, p. 413 note 8 and Gen 49:04, p. 536 note 10.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I don’t know whom to ascribe these particular choices to, but on the title pages of this series the English translation is ascribed to Rabbi Yisrael Isser Zvi Herczeg in collaboration with Rabbi Yaakov Petroff and Rabbi Yoseph Kamenetsky. Contributing Editor: Rabbi Avie Gold.</p>\n<p>I don't know of comparable examples from Rashi's other commentaries (on the other scriptural books or on the Talmud); I spend more time with this commentary than with those. But why would someone think that Rashi limited his headings to that one commentary and wrote no headings in the others?</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, my translation below is that of <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Daniel.9.22-27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> (with slight punctuation and spelling fixes on my part).</p>\n\n<p>In verses 9:1-19, Daniel describes how, in light of nearing the end of the prophecy of Seventy Years, he prayed to God for the redemption of the Jewish People. In verses 20-21, he tells how, during this prayer, the angel (\"man\") Gabriel was sent to speak with him. Gabriel begins speaking in the middle of verse 22 (and, I repeat, is not a literal translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>(22)</strong> He made me understand by speaking to me and saying, \"Daniel, I have just come forth to give you understanding. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>(23)</strong> A word went forth as you began your plea, and I have come to tell it, for you are precious; so mark the word and understand the vision. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>(24)</strong> Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city until the measure of transgression is filled and that of sin complete, until iniquity is expiated, and eternal righteousness ushered in, and prophetic vision ratified, and the Holy of Holies anointed. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>(25)</strong> You must know and understand: from the issuance of the word to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the [time of the] anointed leader is seven weeks, and for sixty-two weeks it will be rebuilt, square and moat, but in a time of distress. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>(26)</strong> And after those sixty-two weeks, the anointed one will disappear and vanish. The army of a leader who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary, but its end will come through a flood. Desolation is decreed until the end of the war. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>(27)</strong> During one week he will make a firm covenant with many. For half a week he will put a stop to the sacrifice and the meal offering. At the corner [of the Altar] will be an appalling abomination until the decreed destruction will be poured down upon the appalling thing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi (to verse 24) explains that, in response to Daniel's plea regarding the rebuilding of the Second Temple, he was given a message that detailed the events from the destruction of the First Temple to the destruction of the Second. He also notes throughout the passage that \"weeks\" refers to 7-year cycles, not 7-day cycles.</p>\n\n<p>The Book of Daniel is also written out of order, so when the chapter ends after this passage, we have no idea what Daniel's response is; it jumps back in time two kings for the next chapter.</p>\n\n\n",

If this is true, does nation A have a moral responsibility to perform a military intervention?</p>\n\n<p>What raised this question for me was learning the other day that North Korea has a system of concentration camps for persecuting its own people. I began to wonder, is there a halachic perspective that says, yes, this means there is a moral responsibility on other nations to stop this from happening through military force? But I thought the general question would probably be more illuminating.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Yes, Halacha and the Torah deal with ethics at the national level.  Some Rabbis, such as Rav Kook and ilk, even argue that halacha is mostly concerned with the ethics at a national level.  They focus on the Klal and the Tzibur as the main ethical imperative, using individuals as the mechanism to achieve that moral dimension.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah, and Jewish history teaches a policy of military isolationism in regards to moral failures of other states.\nAlthough Israel is commanded to wipe out the 7 nations of Cannan for their moral failures, and the land is to expunge them, Israel is not commanded to destroy any nations outside of it's borders, save Amalek.    Amalek, is given special treatment because of what they did to Israel on their way out from Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that neighboring countries to Israel were practicing pagan sacrifices and passing their children through fire, Israel was never commanded to war with them so that they would stop these practices.</p>\n\n<p>Further, during the time closer to Roman and Greek era, Israel's fighters were often invited to neighboring countries armies to help them fight some other force.  However, Israel never did this on their own, and only fought defensive wars, offensive wars for the land of Israel, or joined a war when invited.  Similarly, other nations would only help Israel if they were asked, even when \"treaties\" were signed of mutual defense.  That is, the Spartans did not help Israel until after Israel asked them to, with a reminder of the mutual defense pact.</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish people are taught to lead by example, not by bashing and attacking people who fail to live up to the standards we expect from them.  The Talmud also teaches to push with the right hand, but pull in with the left.  By all definitions of the term, war is never a force which \"pulls with the left\", but rather going to war is like pushing with both hands. Sometimes that is needed, such as when emptying the land of Idol worship, or defending your land, but that is not the way that the Torah teaches us to influence other nations.</p>\n\n<p>This is all implied by Rambam in his Halachot of Wars and kings, when in Halacha 1 chapter 5 <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188349/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">he writes:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Afterwards, he may wage a milchemet hareshut, i.e. a war fought with other nations in order to expand the borders of Israel or magnify its greatness and reputation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to non-war activities, the Prophets teach us a different lesson.  Yonah was sent by Gd to go to Nineveh to warn the Assyrians that they need to repent else face the city being overturned.  It is clear from here, that the Jewish people do need to help those of other nations, but should do so peacefully and with words, not with military action.  Trade embargoes, harsh words, aiding the enemy of the evil nation, are all valid and peaceful ways of \"intervening\" with nations that behave wrongly.</p>\n\n<p>As to your question about North Korea, I was actually thinking about that today while listening to the news about Syria.  Why doesn't Israel intervene and become the \"hero\" in this dire situation?</p>\n\n<p>I think the answer to this is the same as the answer above.  If the people/leadership of the \"rebellious\" faction. (That which is being killed by their government) does not ask for intervention from a specific country, then said country does not have the permission to get involved. However, based on the last line of the Rambam, it seems that if saving the people from their government would increase the reputation of the nation doing so, then it would certainly be allowed.   As we saw in Iraq however, saving a people from their oppressive government is not always an enhancement of reputation.  Yet in Libya or Kosovo it was. According to Rav Kook's perspective, you can see this sort of logic played out on an individual level with regards to the theoretical halachas of who you are allowed to save on Shabbat and other moral dilemmas, even though in practice an individual should save anyone. (For various different theoretical reasons).  To be more clear, even though the practical halacha of an individual and the nation are different, the theoretical constructs behind the situations are the same.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Shortly before the first Gulf War, an article appeared in the Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society discussing halachic views towards US intervention in this case. It included, among other things, the possibility that just as if Fred was drowning or surrounded by bandits, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12936/stealing-from-or-causing-damage-to-a-third-party-to-save-life-or-limb\">Ernie should try and rescue him</a>, so too if Country A is being threatened then Country B should go rescue it.</p>\n\n<p>However there are some significant limitations on the obligations to rescue, including what degree of risk, and cost, is entailed. Hence a lot of gray; I suppose an isolationist and an interventionist would debate what the actual risks and costs are, too.</p>\n\n<p>As far as strict halacha is concerned, it was taken for granted that nations would go to war -- some wars are \"obligated\" (milchemet mitzva), others only \"authorized\" (milchemet reshut). I heard Rabbi Hershel Schachter say that, for instance, halacha would allow the UK to go to war with Argentina after the latter invaded the Falkland Islands, though not a single UK citizen's life was at risk. The Gemara says a king who attempted to rule well, but went to war and got a lot of soldiers killed, is still not punished by G-d.</p>\n\n<p>So the question isn't Jewish law's allowance or requirement of interventionism vs. isolationism, it's more of a more difficult, nuanced, case-by-case question of Jewish thought -- when is it wise?</p>\n\n\n",

Sometimes the first choice was implicit.</p>\n\n<p>But for the seventh, a clear choice on severity was provided to Pharoh. And note the response: those servants of Pharoh who feared Gd brought in their fieldworkers and animals from the fields. Those that did not directly enabled the death of their fieldworkers and animals by leaving them in the field. See Ex 9:20 - 21.</p>\n\n<p>Drash: While some of Pharoh's servants recognized Gd and saved their people, Pharoh himself willfully sacrificed his field workers and animals in his denial of Gd. Pharoh felt no connection or concern for his field workers and animals. He was beyond redemption.</p>\n\n<p>The seventh plague enables Pharoh to clearly show that he was not the \"Gd\" of his people. (For he would have saved them if that was so.) Rather, he was only concerned for himself and his dynasty. Thus the Parsha ends and sets the stage for the final surrender of Pharoh.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Teachers of Pardes </p>\n\n\n",

Behold!\n  they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of\n  their Sabbath their fish did come to them openly holding up their\n  heads but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We\n  make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression. (163) When\n  some of them said: \"why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will\n  destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?\"― Said the preachers: \"To\n  discharge our duty to your Lord and perchance they may fear Him.\"\n  (164) When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, we\n  rescued those who forbade evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a\n  grievous punishment, because they were given to transgression. (165)\n  When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibition, We said\n  to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\" (166) Behold! thy Lord\n  did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment,\n  those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick\n  in retribution, but He is also Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Quran 7:162-166 (Read the rest of this chapter to get more context, if you'd like.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(64) And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter\n  of the Sabbath; We said to them: \"Be ye apes despised and rejected.\"\n  (65) So We made it an example to their own time and to their\n  posterity, and a lesson to those who fear Allah. Quran 2:64-65</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(60) Say: \"Shall I point out to you something much worse than this,\n  (as judged) by the treatment it received from Allah? Those who\n  incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom some He\n  transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped Evil;― these are\n  (many times) worse in rank and far more astray from the even Path!\n  Quran 5:60</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To be fair to the Quran, it is not really saying that the Jews at present are direct descendants of apes and pigs. It is just generalizing that Jews that didn't keep the Sabbath were turned into apes and pigs as a warning to others. In Muslim societies, the words \"descendants of apes and pigs\" is in direct reference to these verses in the Quran. It means that Jews are people who had apes and pigs for their ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether it is the duty of Muslims to kill the Jews. The verses regarding that in the Quran are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(29) Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold\n  that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger\n  nor, acknowledge the Religion of Truth from among the People of the\n  Book, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission and feel\n  themselves subdued. (29) The Jews call Uzayr a son of Allah and the\n  Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their\n  mouths; (in this) they but imitate what the Unbelievers of old used to\n  say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the\n  Truth! Quran 9: 29-30 (In Arabic, the word used for \"fight\" is\n  \"Qatilu\" which can also mean \"Kill\" or \"Murder\". Jizya is a second class citizen's tax. It is still a reality for the Jews in Yemen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for your\n  friends and protectors: they are but friends and protectors to each\n  other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of\n  them. Verily Allah guideth not a people unjust. (51) Quran 5:51.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers wilt thou find the Jews\n  and Pagans; and nearest among them in love to the Believers wilt thou\n  find those who say: \"We are Christians:\" because amongst these are men\n  devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are\n  not arrogant. (82) Quran 5:82. With regards to Christians this verse\n  seems to contradict the one above, but with regards to Jews, it is\n  still full of hatred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those are some of the verses from the Quran. You have to read the whole Quran (where about a third of the verses are dedicated to cursing the Jews). The above quotes are all from Yusuf Ali's translation, the most moderate English language translation available. Yusuf Ali translated the Quran specifically for the Western audience.</p>\n\n<p>Now I will write from the Hadiths (or Ahadith; sayings of Mohammed and the record of what he did).</p>\n\n<p>Sahih Bukhari, Vol. 4, Book 52, Number 176</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</p>\n  \n  <p>Allah's Apostle said, \"You (i.e. Muslims) will fight wi the Jews till\n  some of them will hide behind stones.

That is obviously why it is called the Oral law.</p>\n\n<p>Also what are the oldest recorded written citings of either the Mishnah, the Gemara or the Talmud in other Rabbinic literature?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I found answer to part of my question at the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/581/jewish-life-learning-glossary\">meta link</a> provided by Jake below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גמרא - gemara — The body of talmudic analysis of and commentary to the\n  Mishna, found in the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Tamud.</p>\n  \n  <p>משנה — mishna —</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>a body of law compiled circa 200 CE (circa 4000 anno mundi). </li>\n  <li>a paragraph in that work. plural: משניות — mishnayot, mishnayos</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>I'd still like an answer to the second part of my question</strong> (and more explanation to the EDIT part above, if I have missed something or the information above is not correct).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Mishna is a compilation of (mostly) halachic rulings that comprise the Oral Law, which is the body of knowledge received by Moshe at Sinai sans whatever is included explicitly in the Written Torah. It was compiled (or perhaps even written) by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_HaNasi\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Yehuda HaNasi</a> in around the second or third century CE.</p>\n\n<p>In the next several centuries, halachic discussions took place in Batei Midrash (houses of learning) throughout Israel and Babylonia, which were based on primarily the rulings of the Mishna and other less-prominent compilations of Jewish Law. Many of these discussions were recorded and eventually compiled into the Talmud Bavli (representing the halachic analysis that took place in Babylonia) and the Talmud Yerushalmi (representing that of Israel) about four hundred years later (give or take).</p>\n\n<p>\"Gemara\" is the term that refers to deep halachic analysis, especially when it revolves around the rulings of the Mishna. Because of this, the Talmud is often referred to as the Gemara. (By the way, as a general rule, whenever someone says \"the Talmud\", they are referring to the Talmud Bavli, as it is more commonly and widely studied since it has the advantage of being more thoroughly redacted and practical halachic rulings generally follow the Talmud Bavli.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm not really sure about when they were first cited in other works. Published Jewish works were scarce at that time and in the centuries that followed. The earliest sources I know of that explicitly cite the Talmud are the works of later geonim, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Saadia Gaon</a> and R' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherira_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sherira Gaon</a> (who actually wrote a history of the Talmud).</p>\n\n<p>A lot of information can be found on Wikipedia as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The oldest recorded written citings of the Talmud in other works of Rabbinic Literature would probably be the <em>Sheiltot of R. Achai</em>. As stated in the <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/%27Ahai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1911 Encyclopedia Brittanica entry for \"Ahai\"</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is recorded to have been the first work written by a Jewish\n  scholar after the completion of the Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the first post-Talmudic work of Rabbinic Literature, and as a work which cites the Talmud all the time (though not really by name), it fulfills the criteria. Notably, this work predates the works of the geonim mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13427/13438\">the other answer</a> by a couple hundred years.</p>\n\n\n",

Human beings were given certain prerogative - even if the outcome effects D'Oraysays. Lo Bashamim means that \"we the people\" have said prerogative and that we do not defer to heavenly signs for the \"right\" path.</p>\n\n<p>For example: eating Chametz on Pesach is a D'Oraysa. Nevertheless, (at least in the times of the Beis Hamikdash) Beis Din had the power/prerogative to decide when Rosh Chodesh Nisan would be - thereby directly affecting which day will be the first day of Pesach. Now, while one can be concerned that Beis Din would cause all of k'lal yisroel to eat Chometz on (what could/should be) the first day of pesach, because of the power vested them, Hashem counts the BD's decision as fact - and only considers Rosh Chodesh (and by extension, Pesach) to be when BD decided it to be.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is a story in the Gemora (see Bava Metzio 59b) where there was a dispute in the Beis Hamedrash and to prove their point one of the Amaoraim said \"let the heavens testify that I'm correct\" - and indeed a Bas Kol was heard saying that he is indded correct. However the Chahomim disqulifed this proof with \"Lo Bashmayim Hi\" and you can't pasken based on something heard (even directly from) Shomaim.</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/T0206\">6:12</a>, after <em>Hashem</em> instructs him to speak to <em>Par'o</em>, <em>Moshe</em> describes himself to <em>Hashem</em> as \"עֲרַל שְׂפָתָיִם\", close-to-literally \"uncircumcised of lips\" (<em>Rashi</em>: \"sealed-up of lips\").</p>\n\n<p>What does each of these four refer to?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><em>Tol'dos Yotzchak</em> (by Rabbi <em>Yitzchak Karo</em>, uncle of the <em>Bes Yosef</em>), in his commentary to 4:10, says that \"כבד לשון\" refers to an impediment in pronouncing the so-called tongue letters, דטלנת;‎ \"ערל שפתים\", the lip letters, בומף; and \"כבד פה\", the rest. [\"לא איש דברים\", then, would seem to be an all-embracing expression.]</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9459&st=&pgnum=140\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibn Kaspi</a>, \"לא איש דברים\" means that Moshe was not an eloquent speaker, he was literally not a man of words. This was relevant because God was asking him to be a leader, and good public speaking skills are often thought of as crucial to such a role. No one would ever get elected president or prime minster if they couldn't deliver a good speech.</p>\n\n<p>\"כבד פה\" and \"כבד לשון\" on the other hand, are actual speech impediments. (According to the R' Chananel quoted in the footnote in the link, \"כבד פה\" would refer to the letters זרש\"ץ and \"כבד לשון\" to the letters דטלנ\"ת.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, \"ערל שפתים\" could refer to a third speech impediment (which would be the \"lip letters\" בומ\"ף) like the opinion of R' Yitzchak Karo quoted in @msh210's answer and what seems to be the opinion of Abarbanel, but since Moshe didn't mention it originally when talking to Hashem like he mentioned the others, I prefer the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19168&st=&pgnum=113\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a>'s understanding, that it means simply that Moshe is not a good speaker in that he often has trouble expressing himself through speech, often has trouble finding the right words to express the idea he is trying to convey. In this respect, \"ערל שפתים\" is kind of an antonym of \"איש דברים\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On a clinical level, it almost sounds like apraxia of speech.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.apraxia-kids.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=chKMI0PIIsE&b=839037&ct=837215\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.apraxia-kids.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=chKMI0PIIsE&b=839037&ct=837215</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNB0ihI2srQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNB0ihI2srQ</a></p>\n\n\n",

One pile was of treasures like gold, silver, jewels, etc.; another was of red-hot coals; and the third I cannot remember.

It's a long midrash. Using, DoubleAA's translation I'll go through it line by line.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the daughter of Pharoh would hug and kiss Moses as if he were her\n  son and she would not take him out from the kings palace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sets us up for when Moshe finally does leave the palace, and sees the Egyptian beating the Jewish Slave.  It tells us of Moshe being a sheltered and charismatic person from his birth.  This sheltering, is one of the reason he was able to become such a holy man.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And since Moses was so beautiful everyone wanted to see him and anyone\n  who saw him would not leave. And Pharoh himself would hug and kiss\n  Moses and Moses would take the crown off Pharoh's head and place it on\n  his own, just as he would do in the future when he grew up....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While adding to his Charisma, this section also explains to us the test, since the Torah itself never tells us that Moshe took over Pharoah's malchut.  In the Torah, that theme doesn't seem to be apparent, while it is a large theme in the midrashim. It highlights the importance of charisma to be a leader, and it show Moshe as the Kingship, while Aaron has the Kahuna.  It hints to the transfer of leadership from the Firstborns of Israel to the Levites after another incident with gold.. the golden calf.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And sitting [before Pharoh and Moses] were the magicians of Egypt,\n  and they said [to Pharoh], \"We fear this [child] who takes your crown\n  and puts it on his head, lest he be the one that we have said is going\n  to take the kingship from you.\" Some suggested to kill him [by sword]\n  while some suggested to burn him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the way of wicked people.  Kill the baby now out of fear that they will grow up to be an enemy in the future.  It was this logic which caused Pharoah to oppress and enslave the Jews in the first place.  Moshe here becomes a symbol of the Jewish people, who over the years get persecuted either by the sword or by burnings (of the beit hamikdash)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Jethro (Yitro) was sitting among them and said, \"This child has no\n  intellect!\" So they tested him and brought before him a bowl of gold\n  and a bowl of coals. If he would grab the gold then he had intellect\n  and they would kill him. If he grabbed the coals, then not and he\n  would be free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, Yitro is the middle voice, and Yitro as a member of Pharoah's court comes up often. He is the archetype of the \"righteous gentile\" who helps the Jewish people out of wisdom and middle temperance even though he does not join them officially.  There is also the running theme of midah kneged midah here, where the suggestion of burning or killing, is associated with metal and coals.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moses reached for the gold, but the angel Gabriel came and pushed his\n  hand, and he** grabbed the coal and he** inserted it with Moses's hand\n  into Moses's mouth and it burned Moses's tongue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even though at this point in time, Moshe could have taken the crown, for he was born into greatness, and according to this midrash even born with great intelect, that rightful declaration of Moshe as king, was not to be done at this time.  So Gabriel, who strengthens people by withholding what they deserve at this time, saves moshe and the Jewish people by forcing him to towards the coals and humility.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And this is how Moses developed his speech impediment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why Moshe could not speak well.  He was too humble and could not assert his rights towards the kingship.  His poor ability to speak to the king of Egypt would later blossom into his great ability to speak to, and lead, the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n",

[Incidentally, the midrash above (11:2) seems to say that birds were involved as well.]</p>\n\n<p>What necessitates that the mixture be of animals specifically? The hint is Tehillim 78:45:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יְשַׁלַּח בָּהֶם עָרֹב, וַיֹּאכְלֵם;    וּצְפַרְדֵּעַ, וַתַּשְׁחִיתֵם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It has to be something that can \"devour them\".

He explains that the plague entailed a pack of wolves descending upon Egypt. (Maybe they were <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2011/12/was-rachel-imeinu-killed-by-werewolf.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">werewolves</a>. :)) These wolves are called ערוב because they attack primarily at night.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>To summarize the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1398412/jewish/What-Was-the-Fourth-Plague.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chabad.org link that Hacham Gabriel provided:</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=8&mefaresh=raba\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shemos Rabba (11:3)</a> brings a disagreement between R' Yehudah and R' Nechemia.\nR' Yehudah maintains that it was a swarm of different wild animals.

The default here is 40 minutes instead of the usual 18 minutes I've heard. </p>\n\n<p>Why 40? Why do I even have a choice?</p>\n\n<p>Does the fact that I am in Jerusalem play a role?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The reason why we light candles a few minutes early (18 minutes) is in order to avoid any possibility of starting Shabbat late. Think of it as a train leaving the station. If you're one minute late, you missed it.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, though most communities light Shabbat candles 18 minutes before sunset, local custom may vary. For instance in Jerusalem, the custom is to light 40 minutes before sunset.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/sh/ht/fn/48965051.html\">http://www.aish.com/sh/ht/fn/48965051.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Jerusalem lights candles 40 minutes before sunset. (Except for those who don’t follow that custom.) Which sunset? Important question. The standard practice is to count 40 minutes before “sunset of elevation”. Jerusalem is a little over 800m above sea level. If one could see the sun set over a horizon at sea level (which can be done from some parts of J’lem), it would set about 5 minutes later than someone watching from sea level, or seeing the sun set beyond mountains that are approx. the same height as Jerusalem is. Since the sunset on the same plane is 5 minutes earlier, and for Shabbat purposes is the sunset we would have to consider because of the strictness of Shabbat, then J’lem candle lighting time is really only 35 minutes before “the other” sunset.</p>\n\n<p>All other places at some height above sea level have similar problems.\nTzfat lights candles 30 minutes before sunset. Official candle lighting for Petach Tikva is 40 minutes before sunset, just like Jerusalem. Not everybody holds by that timing.</p>\n\n<p>Some communities calculate Shabbat out at 33 minutes after sunset. Some use the angle of the sun below the horizon to “end Shabbat” (8.5 deg). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5763/matmas63/zmanim.htm\">http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5763/matmas63/zmanim.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>here is the well known custom in Jerusalem to light Shabbat candles 40 minutes before sunset. This custom is derived from a view which requires one to add half of a \"halachic hour\" to one's Shabbat. This amount of time maximizes to be 40 minutes at the height of summer.[<strong>Shita Mekubetzet Beitza 30a</strong>] In order to avoid confusion and ensure consistency, this 40 minute period is adhered to all year long even when half a halachic hour would be less than that.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2008/01/shabbat-candle-lighting-times.html\">http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2008/01/shabbat-candle-lighting-times.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the Quotes instead of a summary, but even though I don't start until 18 minutes before sundown Shabbat is coming!!:)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Indeed the custom here in Jerusalem is to light candels 40 minutes before Shekiah. The current Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Rabbi Moishe Shternbuch discusses the source of this custom in his book Moadim U'Zmanim (vol 8, siman 156). I will try to elaborate more on this after Shabbos if I remember!</p>\n\n\n",

Is it widespread?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>It should be clear to anyone with a Shulchan Aruch that one can certainly bentch after having sung this song. Consider these factors, all of which the Shulchan Aruch says leaving out would require you to redo your bentching, and all of which are missing in Tzur Mishelo:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You must mention both Brit and Torah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=610\">OC 187:3</a>)</li>\n<li>You must mention the Kingship of the House of David (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=611\">OC 187:4</a>) [it never says 'melech' in Tzur Mishelo]</li>\n<li>You must mention Retzei or Yaaleh VeYavo as appropriate (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=613\">OC 188:6</a>) [this only applies to the relevant meals which is most of the time]</li>\n<li>You must mention both God's name and His Kingship in every blessing (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=699\">OC 214:1</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To further support my position, consider two other issues which the Shulchan Aruch debates (\"yesh omrim\") if you need to redo your bentching if you left these out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You must have positive kavana to fulfill the mitzva (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=244\">OC 60:4</a>)</li>\n<li>You must have a <em>chatima</em> (a conclusion to the blessing) for every blessing (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=610\">OC 187:1 and MA ad loc</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And even in these cases were one to say that the d'oraita requirement has been fulfiled (my opinion is that this can be argued well for the 3rd and 5th issue) then you still would be required to say all the blessings anyway as a rabbinic enactment. </p>\n\n<p>However you spin it, there is surely sound basis to say the entire bentching after singing Tzur MiShelo according to the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In terms of my personal experience, I have never seen anyone be careful about this except in jest. I sing Tzur Mishelo often at my shabbat table.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Siah Yis'haq (Siman 284) says there is certainly reasons not to say it. What's interesting is what he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכמו\"כ הובא בספר שערי רחמים, שהגר\"ח מוואלאזין לא אמר פיוט צור משלו, באשר יש פקפוק אם לברך אח\"כ ברכת המזון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Haim MeVolozhin didn't say it because there is a Safek if you can say Birkat HaMazon afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I read in an Artscroll Birkon that this Zemer may be ascribed to Rashbi therefor it seems Meshubah to say it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The fact that all the Sidurim and Bentchers practically print this song shows that most people have no issue with singing Tzur MiShelo. </p>\n\n<p>In addition I know of at least two Chasidishe groups that they sing it at the Friday night Tisch prior to Bentching.</p>\n\n\n",

Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be every one that blesseth thee. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rivka only had two sons and Yitzchak didn't have any other wives or concubines.  Why does he use the plural when referring to Yaakov's mother's (other) sons?</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is that he was guarding against the possibility of future children.  This seems to be inconsistent with Yitzchak's health at the time he gave the blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that by <em>sons</em> he means <em>descendants</em>, meaning Eisav and all his children, but that's unbalanced -- if Eisav's sons are his mother's sons, then so are his <em>own</em> sons when he has them.</p>\n\n<p>Someone fluent in Hebrew told me that we should read this as <em>mothers' sons</em>, meaning Rivka and Sarah rather than just Rivka.  This person told me that the segol in <em>imecha</em> is plural, but I have never seen a translation that renders it plural.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi doesn't comment on this, nor do the chumashim I checked (not an exhaustive search, I know).

If you take the Midrash's timeline, then Rivka was 37 years younger than Yitzchak and Yitzchak was 123 at the time of the blessing in question, so we do have to wonder about Rivka's capacity to give birth at the time.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Many say that this refers to Eisav's children (or, from Yitzchak's perspective, Yaakov's children).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19168&st=&pgnum=67\">Ralbag</a>, though, doesn't have a problem with asserting that it refers to Eisav alone.

He points to \"וּבְנֵי דָן חֻשִׁים\" - \"The children of Dan are Chushim.\" (Bereshis 46:23)</p>\n\n<p>Also, Ralbag seems to believe that \"thy mothers sons\" implies people that are currently alive. Thus, if one were to say that it refers to grandchildren as well, then they would have to acknowledge either that Yitzchak knew he was speaking to Yaakov (and that Eisav had children at the time) or that Yaakov already had children to refer to (or at least Yitzchak thought he did).</p>\n\n<p>An additional interpretation, suggested by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=309\">Abarbanel</a>, is that \"בְּנֵי אִמֶּךָ\" translates as \"<strong>family of</strong> your mother\", which would refer to Lavan and the rest of the descendants of Bethuel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To add to the other answers: <em>B'reishis Rabba</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9658&st=&pgnum=560\" rel=\"nofollow\">66:5</a>) comments that לְאֻמִּים refers to the children of Yishma'el and the descendents of K'tura (Hagar), while \"your brothers\" (and seemingly also \"the children of your mother\") refers to Esav and his generals.</p>\n\n<p>The Malbim, interpreting Yitzchak's blessing as intended for Esav, instead comments that \"your brothers\" refers to the children of Yishma'el and the descendents of K'tura, while \"the children of your mother\" refers to Ya'akov's children. The effect of the blessing was reflected, so \"the children of your mother\" presumably turned into a reference to Esav's children.</p>\n\n\n",

You have the bottom under control but the top can tilt so it can also open or twist. Imagine trying to balance an up-side down broom on your hand, based on leverage, the higher (and further from your hand) you go, the less strength needed to straighten it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3747&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer Darchei Chaim</a> in the note #65 on the bottom it says in the name of either the Divrei Chaim or his son the Shinever that it is done on the top third similar to Mezuza which is placed on the top third of the door.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Practicality.  If left in the middle, when it is being carried and moved about, the gartel slips a little and descends (because of gravity), after which its function of keeping the scrolls together and tightly bound becomes severely diminished because it slips to the bottom. However, when placed in the top third, it does slip, and slips to the middle.  In this case then its function is maintained, and the scrolls don't slip.</p>\n\n\n",

Does it have mystical numerical meanings? (i.e. stability), does it have to do with human memory and good oration?

The cap on both plastic and glass bottles is manufactured separately from the bottle itself, and then affixed to the top of the bottle after the bottle has been filled with liquid.  Removing the cap from this kind of container is not making a new vessel, because the bottle itself was already fully made beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>Contrast this with an aluminum soda can.  Since the tab of the can is part of the top seal itself, the can has never been a functioning vessel (i.e. one that can be accessed to fill and empty).</p>\n\n<p>By pressing in the tab of the aluminum soda can, one actually completes the \"manufacture\" of a new vessel.  This is forbidden on shabbos for the reasons stated above.</p>\n\n<p>Watch soda cans being made here:\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPFzr50TkP0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPFzr50TkP0</a></p>\n\n<p>When it comes to other metal cans, such as canned tuna, beans, etc. a similar problem exists.  The can itself is completely sealed, and opening it would create a new vessel.<br>\nIf one would like to open up this kind of can on shabbos, one must \"destroy\" the vessel first.  Simply take a sharp metal knife, and plunge it into the opposite side of the can.  Now that the other side has a hole, it is not a vessel fit for long term use.  Then, open the top with a can opener as usual, enjoy the food within, and dispose of the can.  </p>\n\n<p>(This is only permissible if one does not want to keep the can.  If one has a desire to reuse the can, even with a hole, the problem of creating a usable vessel still applies).</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear to me if this method would also remove the problem of opening a soda can on shabbos - because the pushing in of the tab is still a positive / creative act.  I suppose one could access the soda by cutting off the back end of the can, but that would be very messy, especially when dealing with a carbonated beverage.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>HaRav Mutzafi (Question 91,196 on Doresh-Tzion.co.il) says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מעיקר ההלכה מותר לפתוח בקבוקי שתיה בשבת.‏</p>\n<p>It is permissible (based on the essence of Halacha) to open bottles for drinking on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Even though I have studied them, I don't seem to understand any of his philosophies from them. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In Be'er Hagoleh, Be'er Revii, the Maharal writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והדברים אשר נבאר הם דברים אשר נמצא\n  בספרי חכמה גנוזים וטמונים, על\n  אותן הדברים לא נוסיף ולא נחסיר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to tell us on what he is basing his Sefer. He often leaves subtle Kabbalistic hints as to what he is referring to. An example can be found in Tiferes Yisroel 55:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והבן הדברים האלו אשר אמרנו כי אין לבאר יותר מזה, אך כאשר תעמיק תמצא כל הדברים מבוארים נמשכים מן החכמה ומגיעין עד הבינה ואל הדעת, ובדרך זה נמשכים אל יסוד אמונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As to which sources the Maharal utilized, see his introduction to Be'er Chamishi of his Be'er Hagoleh</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותחלה נאמר שהיה להם לתת לב, שנמצא בדבריה׳\n  איזה ענינים שיראה לאדם רחוק מן הדעת\n  וסתומים הם במקומם, וסודם נגלה מבואר במקום\n  אחר כמו במדרש הס׳ הזוהר ובמדרש הבהיר לר׳\n  נחוניא בן הקנה ושאר ספרי חכמה, אשר הם\n  גנוזים וכמוסים באוצרות חכמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We also have him quoting R' Meir ibn Gabbai' Avodas Hakodesh and Maarachos Elokus in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14193&pgnum=232\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Derech Chayim, fifth chapter</a> on the Mishna of the ten things created Erev Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the Arizal is not the originator of Kabbalah. The Arizal himself had a Rebbe, the Ramaq, although at some point he surpassed him. The Ramban was famous as a Mekubal and wrote much, although not very explicit. This is even before the Zohar Hakadosh was found. The Ramban had a Rebbe, Reb Ezriel, who learned from the great Ri Sagi Nahar. There are also writings in Kabbalah from Rav Hai Gaon, who mentions the Mesora of the Roshei Yeshiva.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Maharal doesn't discuss Kabbalah openly it is hard to speak of his particular Shita in esoteric topics. But being that he was before the Arizalwe'd naturally assume that his Kabbalah would have been in line with pre-Arizal Kabbalah. </p>\n\n<p>However, in the מגילת יוחסין printed in the first volume of חידושי אגדות מהר\"ל, he mentions that the Maharal met the Ri Sarug, who was a much celebrated Talmid of the Arizal and left before Reb Chaim Vittal came. He is the mentor of the Rama MiFano in Toras Ari.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, there is one parallel which I found. The Maharal, in discussing the Aggadata in Nidda 24b, about when Abba Shaul describes the depth of Avshalom's eye, explains that before the creation was possible the void for it had to first be created. This very much parallels the concept of צמצום.</p>\n\n\n",

Specifically, to what extent do we view our breaks as coming from Sinai? Are there Christian influences affecting some spots? What are some places where we differ from the Christians (if any)?</p>\n\n<p>Note this is about <em>verses</em> not <em>chapters</em>. Sources highly recommended.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>A primary source that bears on this is Megillah 3a/Nedarim 37b, which lists פיסוק טעמים and פסוקים (the divisions of cantillation and of verses) as being of Biblical origin (דאורייתא הוא), and sees these as implied in the description of the Torah reading under Ezra's direction in Neh. 8:8.</p>\n\n<p>We also have evidence from various other places in the Gemara that their verses were pretty much the same as ours. For example, ארץ חטה... ודבש (Deut. 8:8) is repeatedly spoken of as \"this entire verse\" in Berachos 41a, Eruvin 4a, et al. So is שמע ישראל... אחד (ibid. 6:4), in Berachos 13b; תורה צוה... יעקב (Deut. 33:4), in Sukkah 42a; and others. In Taanis 27b the sections Gen. 1:1-5 and 1:6-8 are described as being, respectively, five and three verses long, exactly as we have it; similarly in Megillah 21b the reading for Rosh Chodesh (Num. 28:1-15) is described as consisting of sections 8, 2, and 5 verses long, again exactly matching our divisions.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, there are some cases, as with other aspects of the Oral Torah, where there are variant opinions. Kiddushin 30a thus mentions that Ex. 19:9 was divided \"in the West\" (Eretz Yisrael) into three verses, where the Babylonians had it as one (as we do); the next line then gives the number of verses in the Torah as 5888, as compared to our 5846 (although it is worth noting that this is still an agreement of over 99%). There are a couple of places in the Torah where even today there exist different traditions on how to read them, such as Gen. 35:22 and the two repetitions of the Ten Commandments, where two sets of trop are printed, representing two different ways of dividing the verses. I guess it's conceivable that there might be places where the non-Jewish verse divisions* were taken over into our mesorah, but based on all of the above it would seem that these would be at best isolated cases.</p>\n\n<p>* Not to be confused with the chapter divisions and verse numeration, which are unquestionably of Christian origin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In terms of places where we differ from the Christian version, compare how the two of us count the introductory phrases in Psalms:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2620.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms%2020&version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christian</a></p>\n\n\n",

About the hail and the darkness, Moshe doesn't say anything to this effect, but the narrative records that the Jews weren't affected (9:26, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0210.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">10:23</a>). Nothing is said explicitly regarding any of the other plagues.</p>\n<p>Why is this? According to the Midrash (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%98_%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 9:10</a>) that, for example, the plague of blood didn't affect the Jews either, why is this \"distinction\" spelled out only beginning with <em>arov</em>? Conversely, are there any sources that suggest that some of the plagues indeed did affect the Jews, and that they were exempted only from the ones where it's specified otherwise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&pgnum=99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra (7:24)</a> says that Jews were affected by the first three plagues (Blood, Frogs, and Lice), since:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That's the story the verses tell</li>\n<li>They weren't that bad (i.e. only an inconvenience, I guess. - he says that the Jews also dug for water)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>They were spared from Wild Animals because it was a harsh plague. They were also spared from Pestilence and Hail for the sake of their animals. </p>\n\n<p>They were not spared from Boils. The Ibn Ezra doesn't give a reason, but I guess it's because the verse doesn't mention it.</p>\n\n<p>They were not spared from Locusts, since they were leaving anyway and didn't need the crops.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15936&pgnum=39\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Likutei Sichot vol 11, pg 31</a>-32) brings (and questions) the Radvaz who disagrees with the Ibn Ezra's interpretation and brings proofs from the verses.</p>\n\n<p>Then the Rebbe brings the Rambam (in his Commentary on the Mishna - Avot 5:4) who says that the Jews were not affected by Blood or Frogs, but were affected (albeit without pain) by Lice.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe then says that Rashi agreed that the simple meaning of the verses indicate that the Jews were affected by the first 3 plagues. The first two plagues were to attack the god of the Egyptians, the Nile River. If part of the River was unaffected, Pharaoh would use this as a proof that the Nile was stronger than G-d, which is why everyone was affected.</p>\n\n<p>The plague of Lice was intended to get the Egyptian magicians to admit that it was \"the Finger of G-d\". If the plague was limited in anyway, the magicians would say that all the plague proved was that Moshe and Aharon were better magicians than they were, since they couldn't produce the lice at all, but even Moshe and Aharon couldn't make the lice extend over the whole country of Egypt. Therefore even the Jews in Goshen were affected by the Lice.</p>\n\n<p>Only after that was the separation between the Jews and the Egyptians made (as the verses testify with regards to the Wild Animals).</p>\n\n<p>[I learned somewhere, but I can't find it now, that the fact that the Jews were not affected by the Wild Animals made the plague even more apparent that it was the work of G-d, since man made borders mean nothing to wild animals, yet they stayed out of the Jewish area]</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As the Rebbe says in Chapter 10 of the Sicha, the simple meaning of the verses differs from the interpretation of the Midrash.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>@Menachem's answer addresses your question regarding sources that suggest that some of the plagues affected the Jews as well as the Egyptians. However, regarding your question of why the distinction is \"spelled out\" only prior to the fourth plague, <em>arov</em>, I will offer the explanation of Abarbanel (who, by the way, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5306&st=&pgnum=320&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">believes</a> that the Jews were not affected by <em>any</em> of the plagues):</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14386&st=&pgnum=72\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a>, God intended to make three things known with the plagues: (1) that He exists, (2) that he controls worldly events, and (3) that there exist no other gods. The plagues were grouped (according to דצ\"ך עד\"ש באח\"ב) with each group corresponding to one of the \"themes\" above. Thus, <em>arov</em> corresponds to a breaking point, the beginning of the plagues that were to show God's dominion over the world. Part of this was \"וְהִפְלֵיתִי בַיּוֹם הַהוּא אֶת אֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן אֲשֶׁר עַמִּי עֹמֵד עָלֶיהָ\"; that God had the power to inflict punishment on those who deserve it while sparing his people from harm. This is why Moshe introduces this plague with the information that it will not affect the Jews in Goshen, as well as concluding with \"לְמַעַן תֵּדַע כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה בְּקֶרֶב הָאָרֶץ\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The commentary of <em>Rambam</em> to <em>Avos</em> 5:4 reads (in my own, loose translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>… and the wording of the Torah about every single plague among them [=the ten plagues] was that God brought [it] upon the Egyptians only, except the plague of lice, where it did not say so explicitly: rather, it's known that the Jews were not punished [with lice] but [the lice] were found near them, not bothering them. So explained the sages. (But for the other plagues the matter is clarified: at blood it says \"the Egyptians could not drink water from the river\", ….)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I propose that since, according to the <em>Rambam</em> (or the sages he cites), the Jewish area, <em>Goshen</em>, was affected by lice, the distinction between <em>Goshen</em> and the Egyptians areas was spelled out starting only with the next plague.</p>\n\n\n",

This is very different from something like kriat shema or lulav which have very specific yes's and no's for specific times and instances.

Once Hashem's special presence is assumed, the required kaddish may be said regardless of whether people are listening.  The Aruch haShulchan (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=111&hilite=\">OC 55:12</a>) uses the above idea to justify why one who can speak but not hear may be counted as one of the 10.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the Shulchan Aruch (OC <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=289\">124:4</a>) states that by the leader's repetition of tefila, if 9 are not paying attention, the brachos are almost as if in vain.  I would guess this is because kaddish is a requirement even for 1 person, but there is a technicality that it can only be said among 10 (see end of Aruch haShulchan <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=111&hilite=\">55:9</a>).  The repetition of tefila is created only through having 10 people, so ten congregants have an equal obligation to say the repetition, a requirement fulfilled by the appointed leader- the shatz.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the Shuchan Aruch's requirement by the repetition (124:4) just says they have to pay attention.  Saying amen in not a requirement of the congregation, but a personal requirement that when we hear a bracha we should say amen (see Aruch haShulchan <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=210\">124:11</a>).  Even if one is fulfilling his obligation through the bracha and the amen becomes more pertinent, we say shomea k'oneh (listening is like answering).</p>\n\n\n",

He only gets the first one. Alternatively, even when there are multiple kohanim in a shul, only the first aliya goes to a kohein. </p>\n\n<p>The question was raised at the end of that answer regarding if mincha and maariv are being davened back to back, does the kohein have preference for each one, or does the fact that they are together mean he only gets to go first, but a yisrael goes second?</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to ask a variation: what if a kohein, a levi, and a yisrael (walk into a bar...) eat all three meals on shabbat together with no one else attending (for instance, they are roommates).

Most importantly, <em>where do we draw the line between connected and disconnected events</em>?</p>\n\n<p>(This situation would often happen to me, a yisrael, if I went to someone's house for shabbat with a kohein friend, back in college.

I think they're as follows (though it's been a while, so I may be messing some of these up).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A bird <em>ola</em> is brought on the top of the <em>mizbeach</em>, and <em>chatas</em> on the bottom. Do either one wrong, and it's invalid.</li>\n<li>A <em>chova</em> is one <em>chatas</em> and one <em>ola</em>; a <em>neder</em> or <em>n'dava</em> is two <em>olos</em>. If you bring more <em>olos</em> or <em>chataos</em> than that from a <em>ken</em>, the excess are invalid.</li>\n<li>Both birds of a <em>ken</em> are <em>b'ne yona</em>, or both <em>torim</em>. If a mixed <em>ken</em> was brought, only the <em>chatas</em> is valid; <em>ben Azay</em> says only the first brought is.</li>\n<li>If a bird may have been designated as a <em>chatas</em>, it cannot be brought as an <em>ola</em>; and vice versa.</li>\n<li>If a bird can't be brought or was brought but is invalid, bring a new one in its stead, and its former mate is fine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why, then, does the <em>maseches</em> go on and on with examples instead of simply stating the rules? <em>Mishnayos</em>, from what I understand, are usually written to be easy to memorize. Surely <em>Kinim</em> as we have it is harder to memorize than the above.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>While your summary might work for the general behavior of bringing sacrifices of birds in ideal situation, your summary does not cover, or give reference to the border cases, and what exactly is to be done with various birds or situations that can not be offered.</p>\n\n<p>Also, at the point in time in which the mishna was written, these cases were not done in practice, so it seems that in these situations the Mishna is acting as it's own gemorah explaining as much as it can in as short a space as possible.  The rules as you have written them , might have allowed for expansion, but that expansion would have been lost due to a lack of familiarity and practice.  Just skimming through the mishnayot I see lots of information that is not covered in your short summary.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, many people are able to learn extra idea and lessons from the Mishna which do not directly relate to the halachot as summerized. For example, you can learn some insights into childbirth and oaths from the mishnayot which one would not be able to learn from a summary of rules.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>One significant rule you didn't mention is that if a bird from a group of \"undesignated pairs\" flies into another such group, it invalidates one bird in each group. Another important topic is the discussion at the end of the masechta regarding a kohen who didn't do what he was supposed to.</p>\n\n<p>In any event, aside from the fact that there are more rules than the ones you mentioned, it should be noted that Mishnayos in general deal with practical, real-life cases rather than dry legal principles. For example, you will learn about the law when an ox gores a cow, or when two people fight over a tallis, rather than learning the bare rules that underlie those laws.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Yaakov Epstein</a> in his book \"Introductions to the Tannaitic Literature\", pg. 62, wrote on Kinim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"קינים היא כולה משנת ר' יהושע...ואמנם כל המסכת עם סדרה המיוחד, העמוק וההגיוני, ופירוט כל הפרטים והמקרים שאפשר להם להיקרות נושאת עליה חותם של ר' יהושע עם ספקותיו וספק ספקותיו (טהרות פ\"ו מ\"ב-מ\"ו, עדויות פ\"ב, מ\"ז).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"Kinim is entirely the mishna of Rabbi Yehoshua...and indeed the whole tractate with its special, deep and logical organization and its describing of all of the details and cases that may possibly happen carries the signature of Rabbi Yehoshua with his uncertainties and compound uncertainties (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Tahorot.6.2-6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharot 6:2-6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Eduyot.2.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eduyot 2:7</a>).</p>\n<p>In other words, Rebbi inserted into the Shas this masechet of Rabbi Yehoshua almost as it was given over by Rabbi Yehoshua, with hardly any later edits (Epstein notes the very few additions made by later tannaim).

Can a woman act as sandeket? The first halachik\n  objection to this custom was voiced by Rabbi Meir of Rotenburg in the\n  thirteenth century. Before this time, a woman was able to act as a\n  sandeket or baalat brit. Later Ashkenazi authorities disapprove of a\n  woman acting as sandeket out of fear of intermingling of the sexes.\n  Today, when women and men do interact at both secular and religious\n  events there is room to be lenient with this objection. However, Rabbis\n  may be more stringent with laws regarding intermingling of the sexes\n  when the brit is set in a synagogue, and some mohalim may be uncom-\n  fortable with the idea of a female sandeket. </p>\n  \n  <p>In the final analysis, the role\n  of sandek is honorary and symbolic and does not affect the status of the\n  child.

    "title": "What does the angel Gavriel represent?",
    "content": "# What does the angel Gavriel represent?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In trying to come up with an answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13453/moshe-and-the-red-hot-coals\">this question</a>, I became aware that the angel Gavriel plays a common role in several aggados and midrashim. Not only in the midrash with Moshe and the burning coal (in the linked question), but also in an earlier midrash regarding Gavriel hitting Moshe so that he would cry to elicit sympathy from Pharaoh's daughter, and an aggada regarding Esther pointing originally to Achashverosh until Gavriel pushes her hand to point to Haman instead when she says \"איש צר ואויב\". I'm sure he plays a similar role in other aggados that I do not know or cannot recall.</p>\n\n<p>This prompts the question: Why is Gavriel the one featured in these aggados manipulating the acts of humans? Again, following the assumption that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4037/does-one-have-to-take-a-midrash-aggadah-literally\">these aggados are metaphorical</a>, what is it that Gavriel represents?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Traditionally, the name Gavriel is translated as \"Gd is my strength\", or more literally, \"My strength, Gd\".</p>\n\n<p>Gavriel is first mentioned in the book of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3409.htm\">Daniel</a>, where he speaks to Daniel to let him understand why the Jewish people were not being redeemed at that time.  He appeases Daniel by letting him know that even though the people are not being saved now, they will be saved in the future.</p>\n\n<p>From a Zoharic perspective, Gavriel would then be Representative of anything dealing with the sephira of \"Gevurah\".  Meaning, a form of strength which comes from withholding something. As <a href=\"http://on1foot.org/text/mishna-pirkei-avot-41\">the mishna</a> says, \"who is mighty? He who withholds his yetzer hara\".  This could be understood as being more concerned with delayed gratification rather than instant gratification.</p>\n\n<p>By holding back at the right moment, a longer lasting achievement is made, which would have been destroyed by satisfying the urge at the current moment.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when the angel Gavriel is evoked in a Midrash, it is usually there to show us a \"moral dillema\" between what would have been correct and right for that very moment, but which would have resulted in a worse consequence in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>As an example for the midrashim you brought up.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With the coals, even though Moshe was then worthy to be king, at the time he had to be humble and wait to show his malchut status later.</li>\n<li>In the basket, even though it would have been better for Moshe not to be raised by a non-Jewess, for the sake of the Jewish people, he had to be raised in the palace to be protected from being killed.</li>\n<li>With esther, even though Acheshvrosh was the source of the problems for the Jewish people, by feasting with the vessels of the Beit Hamikdash and thus removing the divine preseence to allow Haman to hurt the Jews, pointing that out at that time, would have lead to the Jewish people being massacred.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The name Gavriel comes from Gever Keil.

For example,</p>\n\n<p>1.<strong>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browse_wrap\">Browse-wrap</a> license</strong> - There is no \"agree\" button on such websites, one just clicks download and he is legally assumed to have read and agreed to the license.<br>\n2. <strong>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrink_wrap_contract\">Shrink-wrap contract</a></strong> - There is no agree button on the software, and one cannot read the license agreement before buying the software. One is assumed to have read and agreed to the license just by virtue of the fact that he didn't return the program.<br>\n3. Many Gedolim pictures and CDs have a line on them \"sold on condition to not duplicate\". The user never signed or agreed to this condition (especially if another purchased the picture from a store and gave it to him),</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Are any of these licenses valid?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources please.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The short answer is that it depends what the license is asking of you.</p>\n\n<p>There is a concept in halacha of accepting a contract without signing anything. For instance, a Get can be thrown into somebody's yard and it is accepted as valid.  However, these sort of things depend on what is being asked, what is permited/prohibited and the relationship of how you got the software in the first place.  For instance, whether or not there was a verbal agreement along with the unsigned written one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A contract is based on on willing supplier & willing user. Since products on a shelf are from a willing supplier in bulk, the onus is on the user to accept the terms of the agreement or reject them but this is secondary to the agreement of sale for the merx. An implied contract is one that each partry understand the contract terms but and this is a big BUT, The Onus is on the User to agree and with software that is not so easy because you cannot agree to the trms without purchasing it first in which case the contract of sale would be negated. This is the reason that the terms of an EULA are printed on the packaging: so you can read and agree to the terms prior to purchase.</p>\n<p>The terms of a contract must be reasonable and equitable for its purpose and NOT be ultra vires in relation to statute law</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=11&mefaresh=rashi\">Rashi</a> (from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14385&st=&pgnum=300\">Shemos Rabbah 18:1</a>), <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/tnh_text.asp?id=199\">Rashbam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=11&mefaresh=ramban\">Ramban</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14386&st=&pgnum=85\">Abarbanel</a>.) [Abarbanel adds that perhaps God wanted to fulfill that which Moshe told Pharaoh that he would never see him again, and told Moshe about the last plague early so that he wouldn't have to come back to warn Pharaoh later.]</li>\n<li>The Torah here stops to give us background information pertinent to the rest of the conversation between Moshe and Pharaoh. In other words, the conversation was really never interrupted by God; He had told Moshe about the tenth plague beforehand. But the Torah tells us about it only now to understand what Moshe is talking about when he continues, \"Thus saith the LORD: About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt.\" (See <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=11&mefaresh=ezra\">Ibn Ezra</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19168&st=&pgnum=118\">Ralbag</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9459&st=&pgnum=175\">Ibn Kaspi</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40081&st=&pgnum=88\">Malbim</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tora.us.fm/tnk1/jdl/MefarsheyTanach002-11.htm\">Shadal</a>.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, what about the fact that Moshe did see Pharaoh again before they went out during the Killing of the Firstborns?</p>\n\n<p>Many commentators say that \"רְאוֹת פָּנֶיךָ\" means to come see you on my own accord; Moshe later only came to Pharaoh because he called him to come.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=10&mefaresh=ramban\">Ramban</a> suggests that even though Moshe was called to see Pharaoh that night, he never actually saw him; rather, he and Aharon stopped at the entrance to the palace and Pharaoh yelled at them from the inside.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim writes that Moshe said \"I will see thy face again no more.\" But he didn't mean forever. He merely meant that he would not come back to warn Pharaoh before the next plague.

What is the source for this, and why the difference from the Tallit Gadol itself?</p>\n\n<p>What about if you put on a new pair of Tzitzit (Tallit Katan), is the bracha restated?</p>\n\n<p>Also, somewhat related: My understanding is that if one must take off their T'fillin then the bracha is repeated upon putting them back on. Why the difference from the Tallit Katan and is there a source for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Both Tallit (of any variety) and Tefilin have the same operative principle: the one bracha you say covers all instances of wearing, as long as when you take it off you have in mind to put it back on, <em>and</em> you're never in a position where you couldn't be wearing it.</p>\n\n<p>For tefilin, if I have in mind to wear my tefilin for ten minutes, then remove them for ten minutes to help carry groceries (an act which theoretically doesn't require tefilin removal), then put them back on, only one bracha is needed. If, however, I stop and use the bathroom (in which tefilin can't be worn), a new bracha is needed upon re-application of the tefilin.</p>\n\n<p>For a tallit big or small, in theory it can remain worn in the bathroom -- common practice is not to wear a tallit gadol in the bathroom, out of respect for its status as a garment usually reserved for prayer, but that's not an absolute requirement. Hence my first bracha covers any intended removal and re-wearing. (But not if it suddenly, unintentionally, completely falls off.)</p>\n\n<p>In Ashkenazic practice, the optimal blessing for a tallit -- <em>to wrap oneself in tzitzit</em> -- is said only on a <em>talit gadol</em>. For a *tallit katan\", we're not sure it's quite up to that level, so it gets a lesser blessing, <em>regarding the mitzva of tzitzit</em>. So rather than have in mind, when doing the lesser blessing, to cover the better one, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11302/do-married-men-stop-saying-a-bracha-on-their-tallit-katan\">we wait for the better opportunity to say the better blessing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Does that answer your question?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a disagreement between Rav Yosef Karo ('the Mechaber') and Rav Moshe Isserles ('the Rama') regarding this issue. By both tzitzit (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 8:14</a>) and tefillin (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=67\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 25:12</a>) the Mechaber rules that if one takes the object off even for a moment he must make a new blessing when putting it back on while the Rama rules that one only makes a new blessing if he did not intend to put it back on right away. (Note that the Gra here rules like the Mechaber.)</p>\n\n<p>Two caveats: if he was in a situation where he would be unable to wear the object in question, this immediately constitutes an interruption regardless of his intention when removing it and would require a new blessing when putting the object back on. (A common example of this is removing tefillin when going to the bathroom as tefillin are not permitted to be worn in the bathroom. A tallit on the other hand is permitted to be brought into the bathroom.) (See MB ad loc)</p>\n\n<p>If he removed one such object without specific intention and retained another such object on him, then it is considered as if he removed the first one with intention to put it on right away. (A common example of this is removing a tallit gadol while still wearing a tallit katan or vice versa. A less common example is removing one's head tefillah while still wearing the arm tefillah or vice versa.) (See MB ad loc)</p>\n\n<p>Note all this applies to putting back on the same exact object. If one were to put on a new pair of tzitzit or tefillin then he would say a new blessing regardless. (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 8:12</a>)</p>\n\n<p>As is generally the rule, Askenazim tend to follow the Rama and Sephardim follow the Mechaber.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Anyone who says these people sinned is mistaken. For real?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Talmud Bavli Shabbos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=55b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">55b</a><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=56&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">-</a><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=56b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">56b</a>) relates that several Biblical figures who, from the text itself, seemed to have sinned, in reality did not. These statements take the form of \"כל האומר פלוני חטא אינו אלא טועה\" - \"Anyone who says that So-and-so sinned is merely mistaken\". The Talmud applies this to the following persons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reuven, when he seemingly cohabitated with his father's concubine,\nBilhah. (Bereshis 35:22)</li>\n<li>Chofni and Pinchas, the sons of Eli, when they seemingly cheated those bringing offerings at Mishkan Shilo and cohabitated with the women who congregated at the Mishkan. (I Shmuel 2:12-17,22)</li>\n<li>The sons of Shmuel, when they seemingly took bribes and corrupted\njustice. (I Shmuel 8:3)</li>\n<li>David, when he seemingly violated אשת איש and perhaps killed Uriah\nindirectly. (II Shmuel 11:4, 15; 12:9)</li>\n<li>Shlomo, when he seemingly became involved with idol worship. (I Melachim 11:4-6)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My question is, are these to be taken literally as historical accounts, or are they to be interpreted metaphorically like many other midrashim we find in the Talmud as they contradict the straightforward meaning of the text?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Rambam (Hil. Sotah 3:3), based on the Gemara (Sotah 7b), states that a sotah is told the story of Reuven in its literal sense, to induce her to confess: \"Many great and honorable people before you were overpowered by their inclinations and stumbled [and yet they confessed, so you should do the same].\"</p>\n\n<p>Which would seem to imply that there is indeed room to understand that episode, at least, in its simple sense. However, Rema (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1204&pgnum=21\">Teshuvos, sec. 11</a>) argues, essentially, that indeed the people who tell the sotah this know that it is in fact incorrect and is casting Reuven in an undeserved bad light, but that it is worth it to do so to prevent Hashem's name from having to be erased. So it sounds like he would hold that there is no possible way to understand Reuven's sin other than the way it is presented in Shabbos ibid.</p>\n\n<p>About David, there is a different Gemara (Kesubos 9a, bottom) where it first explains the episode with him and Bas Sheva as having been actual adultery, and then continues by quoting the opinion (in Shabbos there) that she had previously been divorced (either conditionally or unconditionally, see Rashi and Tosafos there). So it would seem from there that indeed even the Gemara itself allows for more than one way of understanding that incident.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Abarbanel actually says Batsheva was married -- and hence his commentary was not allowed on the shelves of Ner Israel yeshiva!</p>\n\n<p>I've heard Rabbi Breitowitz say that the statement of David may be taken non-literally; or with several of these, there are really two questions, \"what exactly did they do wrong?\", and \"how deep was their repentance?\" The verse made clear that King David did <em>something</em> wrong, but he had deep and complete repentance.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra says the simple reading of Reuben's sin is as stated, \"and the rabbis who interpreted it regarding moving the beds -- they did a nice thing defending people\" (something to that effect).</p>\n\n<p>As I heard from Rabbi Yosef Gavriel Bechhofer, Rav Dessler explains that when it comes to Aggadata, the goal is to develop a deeper religious experience. If you get more out of learning the messages of these stories with the sins as written, fine. The Midrashic interpretations here drive home different points, which have deep spiritual lessons; for instance, keeping a woman waiting when she wants to be home with her husband is an awful thing, hence the Torah describes it as if they committed a great sin with these women (and perhaps some element of lust motivated Hofni and Pinchas to take their time). With King David, the way of reading it that teaches me the greatest lesson is that Uriah gave his wife a divorce before going off to war, but they had an understanding between them. By interfering with their relationship, King David wasn't technically violating any laws, but he was doing something awful nonetheless. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think that we probably have to understand the Gemara along the lines of Ibn 'Ezra or R' Breitowitz, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13598/5\">as mentioned by Shalom</a>, such that the repentance was absolute and punishment was meted out, and therefore we don't have a right to bring up sins after the fences have been mended Bein Adam LeMakom (which is why Vidui is said silently except for the communal Vidui of Y\"K - See RaMBa\"M Hil. Teshuvah, 2:5).</p>\n\n<p>I have another thought, which could be understood to be in line with the above. I must first say, though, that I have absolutely no source for this, and I'm totally thinking out loud. But I do wonder if, perhaps, the Gemara is to be read in reverse. What I mean is, rather than saying, \"whoever claims the following people sinned is mistaken [for saying it was a sin; clearly it was not a sin],\" perhaps the Gemara is saying, \"whoever claims the following people sinned is <em>merely</em> mistaken [and not themselves sinning badly for bringing to light the sins of those who have repented; Hava Amina - I might have otherwise thought - it was itself a terrible sin to make such a statement, but in fact it is merely a mistake].\"</p>\n\n\n",

You can read more about it <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_388852_en.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Co-lead author Jacquiline Romero said: “This finding shows\n  unambiguously that the propagation of light can be slowed below the\n  commonly accepted figure of 299,792,458 metres per second, even when\n  travelling in air or vacuum.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Professor Padgett added: “the effect has a solid theoretical\n  foundation and we’re confident that our observations are correct.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When photos are slowed down sufficiently, they will not emit the right wavelength for our eyes to perceive it, hence it would be dark. Also their additional mass converted from energy could have been the thing that added more weight to the air that prevented people in those areas from moving, or being able to stand up!</p>\n\n<p>This is only a theory, but it seems to fit remarkably well with the facts given in פרשת בא. As Derech Hashem says, whenever Hashem performs a miracle, He does so in accordance with as much of the laws of nature as possible. After all, \"nature\" (or the laws of Physics) is how the Creator has decided to run the world the majority of the time, according to R' S R Hirsch.</p>\n\n<p>You can leave comments about what you think.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Ad 1: <em>Torah T'mima</em> says  that were he not afraid to differ from all previous commentaries, he'd say the plague of darkness was something on the Egyptians' eyes (he probably means cataracts).

    "content": "# Why don't we see magic today?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Throughout Tanach and Talmud, there are numerous recorded uses and practitioners of magic<sup>1</sup>. </p>\n\n<p>From Pharaoh's magicians to Shaul's necromancer, and magic cucumbers to were-donkeys, the references are numerous. These are not only brought as stories, but oftentimes as factors in halacha.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, why don't we see magic practiced today? Does it still exist? Is it still theoretically do-able or has \"nature changed\"? If it's no longer possible, when did this change occur?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<sup>1: (When I say \"magic\", I refer to supernatural powers that stem from the forces of impurity in the world. Commonly referred to as \"sorcery\" or \"'black' magic\", it was used to do things that are naturally impossible, such as necromancy,  transforming objects into other objects, and \"creating\" things (as long as they're larger than a barley-corn). Frequently \"sheidim\" (demons) and their powers were employed in the use of magic. Not to be confused with illusions and illusionists.)</sup></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Since the strength of Kedusha is not what it used to be, therefore the strength of Tumah is also not what it used to be.

Magic is what we humans call things which we do not understand.  The more we learn about how the world works, the less things we can call magic.</p>\n\n<p>While people in generations prior to us, obviously felt that there was magic, in reality they are just describing situations which they think they understand what was happening (i.e. the use of magic). If all the facts were given to us, we would likely describe these situations differently. Perhaps we might say they are a coincidence, or we would be able to explain the situation \"scientifically\", or we would say the person was lucky with their intuition, or we would say it was just a false confirmation bias, or we would call it poetic language.  It's impossible for us to know, since we no longer have the mindset of people who see \"magic\" happening around them on a relatively common basis.</p>\n\n<p>This follows Rambam’s view. Accordingly, the references to practitioners of magic in Tanach, as well as the prohibition against engaging in such activity, refer to slight-of-hand being presented as supernatural ability.

    "content": "# Does Joshua 8:34-35 disprove oral law's existence?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reading about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaite_Judaism#Views_on_the_Mishnah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Karaite Judaism</a> and it lists a number of reasons, some which I thought were compelling, for rejecting the Oral Law.</p>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joshua 8, 34–8, 35 states:</p>\n<p>After that, he [Joshua] read all the words of the Torah, the Blessing and the Curse, according to all that is written in the Torah scroll. <strong>There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel</strong>, and the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that walked among them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Joshua read every command that Moses had commanded, then presumably there would be no room for the existence of non-written commands that would form an Oral Law.</p>\n<p>How would you reconcile this passage with the existence of an Oral Law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The statement \"all the words of the Law\" is modified by the next phrase \"the blessing and the curse\".  The simple meaning of the verses is that Joshua  explained benefits of keeping the law and vice versa. Not necessarily all commandments.</p>\n\n<p>There are interpretations of the verse that all commandments were taught, but your question is based on a literal reading.  (And, of course karaite only read a literal translation.  I am surprised by their usage of these passages.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Evidence for an oral torah:</p>\n\n<p>In addition to what Hacham Gabriel said, the written torah itself provides evidence that it is incomplete, e.g. in D'varim 12:21 God tells Moshe to slaughter animals \"as I have commanded you\", but nowhere in the written torah is how to do that discussed.  Thus, there must have been some supplementary instruction that Moshe received from God on Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>But what about Joshua?</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a source for the following; it is my own interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>In both 8:34 and 8:35 the verb used is קָרָא , translated here as \"read\".  This can be \"read a document\", which seems to apply in 34, but it can also mean \"call\" or \"proclaim\", as in the first word of the book of Vayikra, where God is clearly not reading anything but calling out to Moshe.  So I speculate that Joshua read the scroll of the law and then \"called\" (proclaimed, \"read out\") the oral teaching, which obviously he couldn't read from a document since there was no document.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Joshua tought the oral law as well. Just because it doesn't specify the MILLIONS of Halachot it doesn't mean he didn't teach them.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah is the basic outline for the commandments, but without the Oral Torah we are clueless. Like it says \"don Tefilin.\" What are Tefilin? What shape? What color? How does it stay on my head?</p>\n\n<p>He didn't just say \"put Tefilin\" and everyone started writing Tefilin with special intent that if not present would invalidate the entire thing. </p>\n\n<p>God didn't expect us to just understand the 1000's of laws regarding each topic on our own! Joshua taught, and just because he did it doesn't mean they had to be written.</p>\n\n\n",

The Beis Yosef and others explain that the general principle is that the Sefer Yetzeirah discusses the use of combinations of Hashem's name and as such any 'magical' practice done using those names is permitted. They continue to explain that the reason that may underlie this is that magic was seen as validating an authority other than God, whereas any magic performed expressly using the name of God would not have that problem. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of the nevi'im I would say that </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>all of what they did was done through similar spiritual 'channels' and </p></li>\n<li><p>it was always done to exalt and promote the presence of Hashem in the world. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>From the story of Shimon Ben Shetach and the 80 witches of Ashkelon, we see that the witches had to be touching the ground to perform witchcraft. </p>\n\n<p>The story is retold in several different places, but in Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin Chapter 6 Halacha 6 (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r4606.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">29A here</a>), it says that Shimon Ben Shetach first had the witches perform their magic, and then asked them to repeat it when they were being held in the air. When they were unable to perform the magic, he killed them.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is (see Rashi to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=44b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 44b</a>) that in order to perform magic using the forces of impurity, once must be touching the ground. When performing a miracle using the forces of holiness, this is not necessary.

[The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&pgnum=105\" rel=\"nofollow\">Da'as Zekeinim on Shemot 8:14</a> explains that this is why the magicians in egypt weren't able to reproduce the plague of lice.

If, however, he merely deludes those who observe him into thinking that he is performing an act although he actually does not, he is given stripes for rebelliousness.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then in the next Halacha, the Rambam returns to his previous theme:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All the above matters are falsehood and lies with which the original idolaters deceived the gentile nations in order to lead them after them. It is not fitting for the Jews who are wise sages to be drawn into such emptiness, nor to consider that they have any value as [implied by Numbers 23:23]: \"No black magic can be found among Jacob, or occult arts within Israel.\" Similarly, [Deuteronomy 18:14] states: \"These nations which you are driving out listen to astrologers and diviners.

There are, then, three possibilities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>He performs some action (waving a wand, saying some incantation, etc.), and the results really do happen (the cucumbers really are harvested magically).</p></li>\n<li><p>He performs the action, but the results don't happen - he's hypnotized the audience into thinking that there is a pile of harvested cucumbers there (or he uses sleight of hand to pick them without being noticed, etc.).</p></li>\n<li><p>He doesn't even perform any action of that sort, just hypnotizes the audience into believing that they've seen both the action and its result.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, Rambam is stating that #1 is impossible, which leaves us with two options. Perhaps, then, he would say that the magician is liable to the death penalty in case #2, for actually performing the action (with the fact that the results weren't, in fact, magical being irrelevant), while he would define #3 as the אוחז את העיניים mentioned in the Mishnah there - he didn't perform any forbidden act (let's assume, for argument's sake, that hypnotizing people is not forbidden) and therefore gets only malkos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>At least according to the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=35765&rid=372\">Maaseh Rokeach on the Rambam</a>, the Rambam did indeed believe in magic. (There's also another pirush on that page called דעת ומחשבה which says the same thing, but I have never heard of it.)</p>\n\n<p>His explanation is that the Rambam could not deny something that is stated in pesukim clearly (as evidenced by his halachos on punishments for practitioners of magic), so the explanation of what the Rambam means by \"falsehood and lies\" is that magic comes from \"sitra achra\" (lit. \"the other side\" i.e. the opposite of holiness). He explains that the reason the Rambam chose such strong language is to distance people as much as possible from such practices.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכאורה דברים תמוהים הם דמעשה דשאול עם בעלת אוב כתוב בפסוק ואין ספק שהיה המעשה באמת וכן בכמה מקומות מוכיח שדברים אמתיים הם ובגמ' אמרו גם כן למה נקרא שמן כשפים שמכחישין פמליא של מעלה וכבר נתעוררו המפרשים ז\"ל בזה ולענ\"ד נראה כוונת רבינו אינה אלא כלפי שהם מצד הסטרא אחרא וזה הוא השקר והכזב שיש בהם שאינן מסטרא דקדושה כלל חלילה ונקט נמי האי לישנא להרחיק המין האנושי מאלו העניינים לגמרי כמ\"ש אחר זה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The rambam is very clear that there is no such thing as sorcery and that it's impossible for a person to do an act of sorcery.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Rambam is honest regarding what the Talmud and Torah and halacha say about such a person.  He isn't going to pretend that the halacha doesn't exist, just because there is no such thing as sorcery and there never will be.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't any different than the halacha for the Ben Sorer (Rebellious child) which the gemora says never happened and never can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Just because nobody will ever be punished with that halacha, and the situation for the halacha can't arise, doesn't mean that the law must be \"removed from the books.\"</p>\n\n<p>And I imagine the Rambam wan't to be sure that even though such things don't exist, a person should not say to themselves, \"Well, maybe it does exist and I will try it.\" because then they would be liable for the death penalty if they succeeded. So this is just an extra precaution to keep people away from such foolishness.  And Gd forbid their faith in Hashem or the Torah is diminished because they think that Magic should exist because of this halacha, but they find it is all fraudulent.</p>\n\n\n",

They maintain the\ncustom that one of the group says <em>mincha</em> in the old synagogue and then the <em>chazzan</em> goes up to the <em>bima</em> and greets the Shabbos. Afterwards, the <em>chazzan</em> descends before the lectern and recites <em>mincha</em> for the entire community.

If this is true, why don't we say those sections in languages that more people understand today, like English or Hebrew?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: The Metzudah siddur says that Uva Letzion has Aramaic in it so people could understand it and the Koren siddur says, similarly, that it is there because the kaddish section is an \"act of study\" and says that \"Aramaic <strong>was</strong> for a long time the language of study\" (the bold is mine). I did not find anything related to this issue in the Artscroll.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Not a comprehensive answer, but some sources indicate that Aramaic (לשון תרגום) has its own unique spiritual significance. (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33143&st=&pgnum=15&hilite=\"><em>Maggid Meisharim</em>, Toldos, re:kaddish</a> and, for a general discussion of Aramaic,<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/21439\">מאמר קדמות הזהר להרד\"ל</a>, ענף החמישי.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I don't mean to open a can of worms here, but I believe that the answer I am about to provide is the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take a step back for a second and a re-think this question of languages in general.</p>\n\n<p>There are vaguely, three reasons why we pray in Hebrew rather than the language we are born into.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1a</strong>. It's the Language of Gd and the supernatural.</li>\n<li><strong>2a</strong>. It's the historical language of the Jewish people. Thereby allowing any Jew from any country to communicate with us, and thus\nkeep us unified.</li>\n<li><strong>3a</strong>. It's the language the prayer was written in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then we have the question as to why some prayers are not in Hebrew. For this, we also have 3 general answers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1b.</strong> Angels only understand Hebrew, so this way we ensure our prayers go only to Gd.</li>\n<li><strong>2b.</strong> So that the average person can understand it.</li>\n<li><strong>3b.</strong> It's the language the prayer was originally written in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When it comes to prayers not said in Hebrew, our common practice seems to be inconsistent. If the reason for saying a prayer is 2b, then there is no common practice to change any particular prayer into the language that most of the congregation speaks.  Nobody in America says Kaddish in English, and nobody in Israel says  Brich Shmei in Hebrew.  However, if the reason for the prayers is 1b, then again we find many inconsistencies, with many extra prayers not said in Aramaic (for example,  Barchu)</p>\n\n<p>The explanations of 3a and 3b, also are not very satisfactory, because this just pushes the question back one step and asks why prayer X was written in language A instead of language B.</p>\n\n<p>To me, this leaves only the following options for why a prayer is said in one language over an other.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1a</strong>. It's the Language of Gd and the supernatural.</li>\n<li><strong>1b.</strong> Angels only understand Hebrew, so this way we ensure our prayers go only to Gd.</li>\n<li><strong>2a</strong>: It's the historical language of the Jewish people. Thereby allowing any Jew from any country to communicate with us, and thus keep us unified.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, this question is only asking about prayers said in Aramaic and not prayers said in Hebrew or English, so we are left with only 2a as a valid answer.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, that Aramaic might have developed for an unknown number of reasons, and it may have died out as a spoken language on a regular basis.  However, many of our texts and indeed our prayers, are writing in Aramaic.  Aramaic was not only the language of Babylon, it was also the language of Israel, and all Jews come from families that at one point or another spoke Aramaic.  Aramaic has as much a connection to the Jewish people as Hebrew does.  If over the many centuries in Galut, we ditched Aramaic for the languages in which we were born, then many prayers would not be able to be said by any Jew passing through said foreign country. The unity of the Jewish people would be jeopardized.  It's not the case that Aramaic only <strong>was</strong> the language of study, it still is. The Gemorah is and parts of Tanach are written in Aramaic and the language is needed to be part of the long history of Jewish life and learning.</p>\n\n<p>The basic premise that Aramaic is not as important as Hebrew to the Jewish people both culturally and for the purpose of education, is in my opinion, a flawed premise. And you can see the falsehood of that premise in the manner in which Aramaic has been kept in both our Prayers and our most holy of Books.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually the reason it was written in Aramaic was not specifically for people to understand what they are saying, it was in order for the (Malachim) angels not to understand what we are praying for, and that reason still remains. </p>\n\n<p>(Per <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosfiyos ברכות ג.</a> כותבים שקדיש נאמר בלשון ארמית לפי שזו תפילה יפה ולכן תקנו אותה בשפה שמלאכי השרת לא יוכלו להבין את הנוסח)</p>\n\n\n",

My direct answer to the question is, instead, <em>absolutely</em>.  The question is, <em>which parts should you skip and when are you considered \"caught up\"</em>?</p>\n\n<p>You should skip parts of Pesukei DeZimra <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%91\">as outlined in the Shulhan 'Aruch (O\"H 52:1)</a>, in order to catch up to the Tzibur.  The point of this is to be caught up for Shemoneh 'Esreh.  <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.92\">As outlined later (O\"H 66:3)</a>, one should interrupt Shema' and its Berachoth to answer to Barechu.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, as a personal matter, as someone who is a) often able to keep up within a few Pesukim over the course of a handful of Perakim (especially Shema', since the Tzibur generally slows down there), but b) will fall behind by an insurmountable distance over a period as long (and generally fast) as Pesukei DeZimra, I believe it is appropriate and advisable to skip those parts of Pesukei DeZimra that are outlined in the Shu\"'A if one is in danger of falling too far behind to be able to begin Shemoneh 'Esreh with the congregation.  If you get <em>ahead</em> of the congregation and begin Birchoth Keriath Shema' on your own, you <em>can and should</em> answer Barechu wherever you are. </p>\n\n<p>I am not making this up on my own, either.  I have been advised that this is the correct approach by various rabbis over the years.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Absolutely not.  Barchu can be answered at any time and if there were such an idea of skipping to say barchu in order, it surly would have been discussed regarding someone who came late.  </p>\n\n<p>However, this person has the same law as someone who came late and may skip in order to daven shemona esre together with the tzibbur.  If he has time to skip and get ahead enough to daven sh\"e with the tzibbur, he should do so regardless of when he says barchu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I once heard that, according to the opinion of the ARIZAL, one should always go in order and recite all of the Davening (prayers in the Siddur), even if it will entail falling behind. In fact, in some Synagogues, the Chazzan will not move on until there everyone has finished reciting each section, and I think that it is a nice custom to follow because it is more fair for people who take a longer time to recite prayers so that they don't feel embarrassed.</p>\n\n\n",

A woman having two husbands, would seem to be a situation where you have the \"receiver\" being in the dominant position of who can \"give\", and would thus be a distortion of roles, similar to the prohibition of a woman not being allowed to wear men's clothing and visa versa.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

It's not to re-create the double-portion, half of which only lasted one meal; it's to serve as a reminder, which can be carried throughout Shabbath.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The mana fell each morning. This means that each morning's portion lasted for lunch and dinner <em>in that order</em>. So based on your logic, either we should use 2 loaves on Friday day and Friday night, or only on Saturday day and Saturday night. Both of these ideas are not mentioned anywhere I know of as the rule of 2 loaves is found only regarding Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it seems that the rule is a general decree to remember the story and we do so by using 2 loaves throughout the entire Shabbat because the existence of Shabbat is what prompted the whole story to begin with.</p>\n\n\n",

I also heard, but it may be a separate topic, that the croutons placed in the soup are a Halachic problem.</p>\n\n<p>What are the issues involved and what do the current day Halachic decisors say? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Your questions are related, but involve different subsets of law to answer them.</p>\n\n<p>As you know, uncooked products may not be cooked on Shabbos.  What constitutes cooking?</p>\n\n<p>From OC <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=269\">318:4</a> and commentaries:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Primary container on a fire</strong> (empty or with liquid):  Potential to cook anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Primary container removed from the fire</strong>- still hot:  Potential to cook just about anything (not ox meat, maybe not salt).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liquid poured from the primary container</strong>- still hot:  Potential to cook a layer of food</p>\n\n<p><strong>Secondary container</strong> (liquid poured from the primary)-still hot:  Generally cannot cook except easily cooked food (nowadays we consider everything easily cooked unless we know otherwise)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liquid poured from a secondary container</strong>- still hot:  Generally cannot cook except easily cooked foods.  Here we allow most things unless we suspect it is easily cooked (think salmon).</p>\n\n<p>These have to do with the air and container walls cooling down the dish so that it will not retain its heat long enough to cook.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the chulent or the soup goes from the pot to the ladle to the bowl, you should be good to go except for 2 laws which are argued about, and we are strict when the dust clears:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Davar Gush</strong>/Solid Items (MB 318:<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=272\">47</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=274\">65</a>):  You've probably noticed that solids retain their heat much longer than liquids.  We pasken that solids do not get downgraded to secondary or tertiary container status, but retain their primary \"container\" status as long as they are hot.  So if your chulent is dry, you may have this problem.  This isn't an issue if your cole slaw is touching a liquid part of the chulent.</li>\n<li><strong>Bishul achar afiya</strong>-cooking after baking (OC <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=271\">318:5</a>):  We pasken that something which is dry baked is not considered cooked in regard to liquid cooking.  So baked croutons may be a problem if you put them in a primary or secondary container of hot soup.  Again, by the time they hit your bowl, you should be dealing with a tertiary container.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding ladles:  Ladles are not easily classified as a secondary container since the liquid was not poured into it but was taken by placing the ladle in the primary container above the fire.  I recall from the Shabbos Kitchen book that we are strict to call it a primary container while it is in the ladle and pouring from a primary container when it is poured.  However, after it is poured into the bowl and should be a secondary container, we are no longer strict and effectively consider it a tertiary container.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, you should not pour the soup from the ladle onto the croutons, but may place the croutons into the soup after it is poured from the ladle.</p>\n\n\n",

Does it really include everything that is not directly related to shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Roughly, <em>muktze</em> things are those that one can't or won't use on <em>Shabas</em>. There are several broad categories of this: if a particular object doesn't fall into one of these, it's not <em>muktze</em>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Valuable or fragile.</strong> If something is particularly valuable, or particularly fragile, so that handling it will ruin it, and it's not going to be used on <em>Shabas</em>, then it's <em>muktze</em>. An example sometimes given is a special knife used for slaughtering animals: it can easily be used for permitted uses on <em>Shabas</em> (contrast the \"useful, but not for permitted activities\" category below), but it won't be.</li>\n<li><strong>Useless.</strong> If something is useless, it's <em>muktze</em>. An example sometimes given is raw meat, or a rock.</li>\n<li><strong>Useful only in violation.</strong> If something can't be used without violating a <em>halacha</em>, it's <em>muktze</em>. An example sometimes given is <em>chametz</em> on <em>Pesach</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Useful, but not for permitted activities.</strong> If the only usual use for something is a forbidden activity, the object is <em>muktze</em>. An example sometimes given is a hammer. <em>However</em>, this category of <em>muktze</em> sometimes has an exemption if you have a valid use for the object for permitted activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Set aside for its <em>mitzva</em>.</strong> If something is set aside for use for a <em>mitzva</em>, you can't use it for anything else: and if the <em>mitzva</em> is done, and it's <em>Shabas</em>, the object may be <em>muktze</em> also so that it can't be moved.</li>\n<li><strong>Base.</strong> If something is a surface on which a <em>muktze</em> object is resting, the base may be <em>muktze</em> to the same degree as the upper object. An example sometimes given is a candlestick with a flame atop it.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Muktze</em> at the start of <em>Shabas</em>.</strong> If something was <em>muktze</em> at the start of <em>Shabas</em> it's generally <em>muktze</em> all <em>Shabas</em> long.</li>\n<li><strong>Born.</strong> Something born or created on <em>Shabas</em> can't be moved until after <em>Shabas</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliberately set aside.</strong> Something set aside for non-use on <em>Shabas</em> can't be moved on <em>Shabas</em>. An example sometimes given is something put out, right before <em>Shabas</em>, to dry for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, all of these have specific rules: this is just a general idea.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yalkut Yosef vol. 3 313</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כמה סוגי מוקצה הם: א. מוקצה מחמת חסרון כיס. ב. מוקצה מחמת גופו. ג. כלי שמלאכתו לאיסור. ד. בסיס לדבר האסור. ה. מוקצה מחמת מצוה, כגון עצי סוכה ונויה. ו.מוקצה מחמת שהיה מחובר או מחוסר צידה בבין-השמשות. ז. מוקצה דדחייה בידים, כגון שנתן מערב שבת צימוקים על הגג כדי לייבשם. ח. מוקצה מחמת איסור שבגופן, שאינן כלי רק עומדין למלאכה שיעשה בעצמן, כגון מוכין של צמר שעומדים לטוייה, ועצים שעומדים להסקה, עורות של אומן וכדומה. ט. מוקצה מחמת איסור מלאכה, שיש עליהם תורת כלי, כגון כלי כתיבה, כיס של מעות, וכדומה. י. מוקצה מחמת מיאוס, כגון עכבר מת, רעי, וכדומה. יא. כלי שמלאכתו להיתר שלא לצורך כלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://yalkut.info/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%97-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%90-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%94.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://yalkut.info/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%97-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%90-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%94.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

The real issue was al\nWaq'f, the Islamic Endowment Authority which had ultimate control over all Islamic shrines, was trying to force HaYishuv into formally acknowledging that HaKotel is a an Islamic shrine. They actually wanted HaVa'ad Le'umi and the Chief Rabbinates to jointly sign an official document stating this.</p>\n\n<p>Pathetically HaVa'ad was ready & willing to do so as were some Charedim. It was Rav Kook the Elder together with the Revisionists who prevented this. They used the Mechitzah (screen) knowing that Arab Muslims would go beserk. The British refused to get involved officially but unofficially leaned on Jews to comply with Muslim demands. The screen was a way in which to force the British to do their jobs.

While these arguments can serve to shore up our beliefs against challenges, many sources see these arguments as helping us acheive a more personal, immediate connection to God.</p>\n<p>The most common such arguments found in Jewish works are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Argument from Design - Many aspects of the natural world appear to have been been designed with intelligence and intent.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Cosmological or \"First Cause\" Argument - What set the world moving? Where did it come from?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The famous \"Kuzari\" argument (which is also found in the writings of R' Saadia Gaon and Maimonides), that the Sinai revelation was a historical event witnessed by the entire nation. (This argument is basically just an extension of the Biblical \"argument\" that is intended to enable us to rely with confidence on our historical tradition.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In my personal opinion, the various philosophical arguments for the existence of God are mainly useful for countering Hume's arguments against miracles. Briefly stated, he argues that no testimony of a miracle should be believed unless the falsehood of the testimony would be more improbable than the miracle itself. It follows, therefore, that one's ability to accept the testimony of the Jewish people's historical experience of miracles has an inverse relationship with the degree to which you think miracles are improbable.</p>\n<p>All of the classical arguments for the existence of God are, fundamentally, arguments that we can perceive an element of the supernatural in the natural world itself. Thus, each such argument makes the possibility of miracles more plausible. At some point, it becomes more likely that Sinai Revelation really occurred than that it was made up (which, per the Kuzari argument, is very unlikely). Once you reach that point, then you have the Sinai Revelation to rely on for everything else.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 33)\n\n<p>Assuming we all exist, think, know and interact with our actual surroundings etc.</p>\n<h2>The Ontological Proof</h2>\n<p>The first class of Divine Proof is the Ontological proof.

(Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 386)</p>\n\n<p>What distinguishes g'rama from garmi is debated - see <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%96%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9F#.D7.94.D7.94.D7.91.D7.93.D7.9C_.D7.91.D7.99.D7.9F_.D7.92.D7.A8.D7.9E.D7.90_.D7.91.D7.A0.D7.96.D7.99.D7.A7.D7.99.D7.9F_.D7.9C.D7.93.D7.99.D7.A0.D7.90_.D7.93.D7.92.D7.A8.D7.9E.D7.99\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hebrew Wikipedia article on גרמא בנזיקין</a>.

(Take the case of the hot coffee: there was no certainty that she'd spill it on herself.)</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Tosafos (followed by Rema, Choshen Mishpat 386:3) says that garmi can also include cases where the damage is usual (דבר שכיח ורגיל); in that case, perhaps in at least some such cases the vendor would indeed be liable for the damages. (In the example of the coffee, they'd previously been warned that their coffee was hotter than necessary and was likely to cause severe burns.)</p>\n\n\n",

He made the brocho BM”M on the rice and the question is whether this will cover the oatmeal.</p>\n\n<p>There are two stages to the answer.</p>\n\n<p>1) Rice is not so choshuv (important) as oats. As proof see the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&st=&pgnum=220&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berura 208 (7)[30]</a> where we see that a mixture of a minority of rice and a majority of another food takes the brocho of the other food. This would not be the case if the rice were replaced by one of the five species. In that case the brocho would be BM”M.  The Mishna Berura says rice is not so choshuv.</p>\n\n<p>2) Rabbi Bodner in his book “The Halochos of Brochos” chapter 7 C explains that a brocho made on one food covers the other “automatically” only when the other is less choshuv. He gives an example that a brocho made on a biscuit made of oats will not cover biscuits made of wheat because wheat is more choshuv than oats. If one deliberately intended to cover the less choshuv food, then it will be covered. </p>\n\n<p>So it seems that the BM”M on the cooked rice will not cover the oatmeal unless he had specific intention to cover it.</p>\n\n<p>But beware Hilchos Brochos is a minefield; ask a specific shaaloh to YLOR.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One of my Rabbanim (possibly a Posek) quoted Maran saying that if you had in mind the rice in the Beracha over other Mezonot (or vice versa) it is Poter the other food, however, according to Maran if he didn't have in mind it doesn't Poter.

So, for any item requiring, I would say that you <em>always</em> have to check the original packaging of what's in the bin, and possibly, if following the Star K's advice, maybe even that is not good enough.  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is only a lay opinion, and you need to speak to your Rav to get psak halakhah. </p>\n\n\n",

Rashi explains that this is because they are לאו מידי דמזון, not a food item.</p>\n\n<p>Then, on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=27&format=pdf\">27a</a>, the Gemara states that \"truffles and mushrooms\" can't be used for this purpose either. Rashi doesn't comment on this here, but on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=34&format=pdf\">Kiddushin 34a</a> (ד\"ה והאיכא) he states וקים להו לרבנן דלא זייני - the Rabbis know as a fact that they are non-nutritive.</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean? If we look at it from the point of view of modern nutritional data, then mushrooms - <a href=\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2482/2\">raw</a>, and even more so <a href=\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2483/2\">cooked</a> - contain carbohydrates, protein, and some vitamins. If, instead, we define \"food item\" and \"nutritive\" simply in terms of whether they satiate a person, then don't mushrooms do that too?</p>\n\n<p>(The notes in Hagahos HaGra to Eruvin there reference Gra's comments to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40431&pgnum=573\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 386:5</a>, where he argues that indeed the Gemara means to apply this exclusion of truffles and mushrooms to a different halachah, about what can be purchased with maaser sheni money, where the item bought has to be something that directly or indirectly \"grows from the ground.\" However, I'm not sure how he would understand Rashi's explicit statement in Kiddushin.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I noticed you have been waiting long for an answer and I have a theory to offer, with some rabbinic support.  Perhaps this is what you are looking for, or it might just set you or another member on a path that might lead to the answer you are looking for.  </p>\n\n<p>I suspect the rabbis believed that a mushroom is non-nutritive because in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 1:29</a> God is recorded as giving to man every vegetation that has seeds and every tree bearing fruit with seeds.  It may be that since mushrooms do not have seeds or fruit with seeds, but rather are a fungus with spoors, they are not considered as given by God for food and thus percieved to be \"non-nutritive\".  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.1.29.1?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramban offers this commentary on Genesis 1:29</a> discussing the difference between seeding vegetation and fruits given to man and non-seed bearing and non-fruiting green herbs given to animals. If Ramban is conscious of God's giving to man specifically vegetation with seeds, and he considered herbage without seeds designated to animals, then certainly the mushrooms would fall outside of that category. If one considers it not food for human consumption, Perhaps that came to be thought of or expressed as non-nutritive, not nutritious.</p>\n\n<p>If you have access to what other rabbinical writings say on this verse you might find something more direct.

Subsequent to the progressive movement any change has to be measured against the new backdrop of many Jews feeling that the Torah needs to be fixed rather than that the Torah needs to guide us in new situations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Judaism maintains (a) that the Torah is God-given, (b) that the power great rabbis have to enact regulations and to interpret the Torah is also God-given, and (c) that others don't have those powers to the same extent.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it (though I'm no expert on the subject), many Jews, who practice/believe what they call \"Judaism\", don't believe any of those three points.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to many, many differences in belief and practice.</p>\n\n<p>You say in your question \"I'm especially keen to hear the views of those that believe in Judaism's adaptability\"; I'm glad to provide that view. As an orthodox Jew, I can assure you that Judaism adapts to the times: rabbis enact (or dissolve) regulations because of the changing times, and issue unusually lenient (or strict) legal decisions because of the changing times. But these are done only after those doing them are grounded very firmly in Jewish belief and study.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You are basically asking 2 questions.</p>\n\n<p>To answer point 1:\nHistorically, the Progressive forms of Judaism came about as a response to the emancipation of Jewish rights in Europe.  For centuries, Jews in Europe were second or third class citizens, often residing in Ghettos and having direct laws against their integration with Christian society.  Along with the influences of the enlightenment and a general separation of the views of \"good citizens\" to keep their religion private and at home, many Jewish people reacted to the new freedoms in Europe by trying to become \"better Europeans\".  They felt the best way to practice Judaism, and to be a light unto the nations was to be fully integrated in European society, and to make Christians feel comfortable in a Jewish home or house of worship.</p>\n\n<p>While many of the reforms started out as being halachically acceptable, more traditional Jews felt that this general idea of trying to assimilate into Europe on purpose went against all the main teachings of Judaism.  Judaism went through this crisis before, with the Hellenist and the story of Hanukah, and the traditional Jews of Europe did not want to fall down that path again.  There then became a clear schism amongst the Jewish people, with each group not willing to be part of the community of the other.</p>\n\n<p>Along with the Haskala movement, and recent fights between Yishivish and Chasidic Jews, a complete separation was perceived to be needed if there was going to be any success in keeping the Jewish people from assimilating and losing all Jewish identity.</p>\n\n<p>That is the basic story of Reform Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>For Conservative Judaism, the split came about because of a change of demographics in America around the 40s and 50s.  People, in general started to move away from the big cities, and created suburbs, and these suburbs lost a lot of the close community that existed in the inner cities.  Being unhappy with the ideals and assumptions of Reform Judaism, but also at the same time, fearing a loss of Jews to the American way of life, they tried to form a compromise in which Halacha was followed, but the preservation of the Jewish American way of life was the first concern.  That is, their halachic stances would mostly be aimed at making sure that American Jews could fully live the American life style, and still feel some connection to Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the now Orthodox sectors of Judaism, felt that trying to adapt Judaism to American life, instead of adapting American life to Judaism was the wrong way to go about things.  One of the biggest splits happened over the Conservative ruling that allowed people to drive to Shul on shabbat if they lived too far away to walk. This was a clear violation of Halacha that Orthodox leaders could not accept, and a sociological divide was created.  Those who lived close to shuls and those who did not, as well as different schools and congregations picking one side over the other.</p>\n\n<p>Other progressive forms of Judaism have their own unique histories and philosophical arguments.</p>\n\n<p>To answer number 2:<br>\nOrthodox Judaism basically views the more \"progressive\" forms of Judaism as having a poorly thought out hierachy of Jewish values.  Due to that difference in view, the end result is that in many cases, Orthodox Jews view \"progressive Jews\" as not following or keeping Jewish Law or Halacha.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This was really just a very long comment on the Question before the clarifications, I'll keep it just cause it's good info to have around.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many forms of Judaism over the centuries, not all of them progressive, and not all of them are still around, and some have made revivals.  Just to list the different names and systemic changes (or maybe meta-halachic?) within Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Perushim, Tzadukim, Kaarites, Samaritans, Early Christians, Hassidut, Sephardi, Kabbalistic, Rationalist, Reform, Orthodox, Conservative, Humanitarian, Reconstructionist, Renewal, Messianic, Haredi, Chabad, Secular Zionist, Religious Nationalist, Open Orthodox, Partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>Of that list, there are what you call the \"progressive\" forms of Judaism.  Those today would be:  Reform, Conservative, Humanitarian, Reconstructionist, Renewal, Partnership and Open Orthodox.</p>\n\n<p>Jews who fall into the Orthodox camp of Judaism, generally view the \"progressive\" forms of Judaism as being \"invalid\", or just not following the path of Judaism.  The reason for why each \"progressive\" camp is not valid differs, but they each have some meta-halachic principle which Orthodoxy feels is not authentic or breaks some key component of Judaism.  Reasons differ from a need to Assimilate, a rejection of the Divine as traditionally understood, or just being too influenced by non-Jewish culture.  However, and this is an important point.. These feelings of being invalid, do not just exist for these \"progressive\" forms, but depending on which camp someone is in, they might feel that other camps are also not valid.</p>\n\n<p>Jews who fall into the Orthodox camp of Judaism generally view the following camps as valid in one way or another: Perushim, Orthodox, Hasiduth, Kabbalistic, Rationalist, Sephardi, Haredi, Chabad(?), Religious Nationalist, some forms of Partnership, and Open Orthodox.</p>\n\n<p>In your question, you brought up another division of Torah Judaism vs Rabbinic Judaism.  All the camps previously mentioned are forms of Rabbinic Judaism.  Torah Judaism camps, are the Tzadukim, Kaarite, Saamaritans, and Early Christians, Messianic Each of these groups have created their own layer of interpretation which is different from Rabbinic Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, the differences between the various camps is in some issue which is not directly addressed by the Torah, or is influenced by some historical or philosophical point that did not exist earlier in history.</p>\n\n\n",

The former though, is not obligatory (at least to the same level) and thus Mishna B'rura prefers the use of \"ונאמר אמן\".</p>\n\n<p>Generalizing from this, it seems that \"ואמרו אמן\" is used when everyone is absolutely required to respond; it is used as a sort of command.

    "content": "# First-born animals today\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From what I understand, the laws of \"bechor behemah tehorah\" (kosher first-born animal) are still in effect today, both in Israel and outside. To avoid problems with this, we sell a share of the mother (I've always heard it explained as 'her ear') to a non-Jew, and therefore the firstborn offspring is permitted. Does that mean that the non-Jew who bought part of the mother owns a share in the offspring? Also, in today's huge meat-packing plants, does that end up being thousands of dollars a year? Does anyone supervise this today (such as the rabbanut in Israel)? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Indeed the laws of firstborn animals (bechor) apply today and the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=288\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 320:6</a>) rules that we should avoid creating bechorot because the laws are very complex and people will likely make mistakes, AND because we can't bring them as korbanot nowadays anyway. He suggests that you sell to a gentile a part of the pregnant mother to make you a partner with the gentile, thereby exempting the embryo from the laws of bechor.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of your question, it seems that we only sell part of the mother and not part of the child as the child is a Davar SheLo Ba LeOlam, a thing which his not yet entered the world about which it is impossible to make a kinyan on (formal transfer of ownership). Thus the child is wholly owned by the Jew.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the size of the portion sold to the gentile, the Shulchan Aruch rules two paragraphs before that it must be something that if it were cut off the animal would be considered blemished (mum). An ear is small and serves this function, so practically we often sell the ear. I suppose if the gentile would keep track of the animal and come to the slaughterhouse and claim his ear, they would give it to him. Practically, no one does this. It's much like selling chametz in that regard. For the gentile, it's a one time deal, and then he leaves and forgets about it.</p>\n\n<p>I am under the impression that the religious kibbutzim in Israel arrange for this themselves, but have no source. (Most if not all kosher meat produced in the USA is from gentiles' herds.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How should we respond to objectionable content in a public forum?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The blessing and curse of sites like StackExchange is that everything happens in public.  Sometimes someone will post something objectionable and it isn't possible to take the person aside for a private conversation the way it would be if we were all in the same physical place.  The strong presumption is that people don't mean to offend and there has been a miscommunication; I am not talking about the flame wars that sometimes break out in other internet communities.</p>\n\n<p>What are the relevant halachot of rebuke and lashon hara?  What is the right way to respond to this kind of situation?</p>\n\n<p>I am intentionally posting this on the main site, not meta, because it is a question of halacha that is applicable beyond this site.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You are quite right that a private conversation would be the best path to follow. Because someone does something <em>wrong</em> in public doesn't mean they should necessarily be <em>rebuked</em> in public. StackExchange itself offers no way of initiating a private conversation. Even creating a restricted-access chat room allows anyone to view what you have said.</p>\n\n<p>I think your overriding concern must be how <strong>constructive</strong> your response is. This is one of whose areas where knowing the halacha is not as useful as a profound understanding of human nature. You need a great deal of empathy to accurately understand the subjects's motivations. Why did he say that? Where is he coming from? And most relevant, how would he react to what you have to say?</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of rebuke is that the mitzvah simply doesn't apply <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/index.php/torah/article/mitzvah239/\" rel=\"nofollow\">if it will not be accepted</a>. Secondly, there are as many ways to improve a person as there are ways of human interaction. I remember a shiur from Rabbi Benji Levin who turned around someone else's behaviour in such a genius, gentle way that they realised their error themselves. It's not just a case of saying to someone that they are wrong.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to Lashon Hara we are not allowed to spread someone's disgrace further, and a public forum like this would make it far worse. Still, it may be a consideration that his comment is publicly visible already, so you are not exactly making know something that was hidden. Also is what he said really a disgrace? This depends on too many factors to make fixed rules about.</p>\n\n<p>To my mind, I think it would be permitted to simply point out that you disagree with what he said, and why. He has entered a public debate, and if you can be reasonably sure you will not make things worse by engaging with him, you are welcome to respond. You need to be dispassionate in your arguments, open to listening and engaging with his response, sympathetic to his point of view (without necessarily agreeing to it) and very respectful of him as a person. Asking questions about flaws in his arguments, as if you just want to understand his point of view, is far more palatable than pointing them out directly and bluntly. If at any point you see that continuing will make things worse, apologise and back off.</p>\n\n<p>Let his faults be his problems, and let your upset about his comments be yours. By this I mean don't expect to be able to change his mind, and don't expect him to feel sorry about upsetting you.</p>\n\n<p>Reasonable and respectful debate, even in public, does not have to transgress Lashon Hara.</p>\n\n\n",

The announcements often have absolutely nothing to do with davening. For example, he will tell us the scores of a game that the school’s basketball team played recently. I know there is no halachik issue of hefsek at this point in davening, but it still doesn’t seem right to interrupt שחרית to tell us this information. In elementary school, I don't thinks the announcements were as unrelated to davening as they are now, but they were also given before אשרי, which leads me to believe that it is accepted to do this. Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is precedent to interrupt mid-davening for a mitzva or for needs of the community.  These announcements were actually made right after Yishtabach.  Examples in the Shulchan Aruch and Rema (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14326&st=&pgnum=98\">54:3</a>) include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Community needs</li>\n<li>Tzedaka allocations</li>\n<li>Blessing an ill person</li>\n<li>Demanding a fellow congregant show up in court (I think the idea was to pressure him through delaying davening.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our custom is not to interrupt after Yishtabach, but there are many places that do so before ashrei for important matters if they are concerned some might leave.</p>\n\n<p>Your concern was also with interrupting for matters such as basketball scores.  I can only think of 2 possibilities:</p>\n\n<p>Not-so-good:  The announcements started as proper, but sometimes we forget the \"heter\" and need to be reminded.  If this is true, don't be embarrassed to ask the announcer in a respectful way why he does this.</p>\n\n<p>Better:  We all know how much high school students enjoy davening ;)  Perhaps the announcer (or whoever sanctioned the announcement) is trying to pump up some adrenalin and hoping to channel it to the rest of davening, but feels that that would be inappropriate prior to davening.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Let me list the issues with this that you may want to bring up.</p>\n\n<p>1) The Shulhan Aruch (28:1 37:2) implies clearly that you are not allowed to be Mesiah Daat (lose focus) from the Tefilin for even one second.</p>\n\n<p>2) Well this is more of a Humra: the Arizal wouldn't even talk Divre Mussar or anything in the Bet HaKeneset because he suspected he might speak things that aren't related to Torah.</p>\n\n<p>3) This is for those who recite Leshem Yihud: Kaf HaHaim Palachi (as well as the Zohar) warn very much against talking in the middle of an action if one recited Leshem Yihud. The Zohar even says that one who stops in the middle of the action he made Leshem Yihud on Has WeShalom his life will stop (Rahmana Lesilan).</p>\n\n<p>4) Rebbe Nachman of Breslev (this source is also from the Zohar and Arizal seen in Orhot Sion) states that one should avoid speaking at all from waking until the end of Shacharis.</p>\n\n\n",

While watching sports, or attending parties around sports, may involve issues of bitul Torah and secularization, and the commercials may be, at times, too racy to expose our children to, I have to note, that I've known many roshei yeshivos and respected Orthodox rabbis who enjoyed sports on television, including the Superbowl, although I can't say I know any who attended a superbowl party, per se.  Some examples:  The mashgiach ruchani of RSA, HaRav Shmuel Niman was, before his current illness, a huge sports fan as are his sons.  I heard him speak to my congregation and hinted to any Redskins season ticket holders, that he would not turn down an invitation to go to a game.  Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer, zt'l, the rounding Rosh HaYeshiva of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington, praised my organization of a synagogue event that drew more than 90 members to a AA baseball game, although he turned down my invitation for him to join us and throw out the first pitch (a privilege we would have earned if we drew 100 attendees).  Also, he once sermonized how he once almost blew off attending mincha with a minyan because he was watching an exciting Redskins game on TV (he said, \"you know it was a long time ago because they were good then\").  He was also known to have corrected a yeshiva student's description of the infield fly rule.  The OU in 2014 co-sponsored a <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/news/superbowl_kosher_halftime_show_nachum_segal_network/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kosher Superbowl party</a>, adding kosher entertainment provided by the Nachum Segal Network.  Moreover, in Teaneck, NJ, there is a sports bar/restaurant called the Dog House, under the rabbinic supervision of Rabbi Zushe Yosef Blech, Hasgachat Kashrus of Kehillas Bais Ben Zion, Monsey, NY, one of the leading experts in kashrus in the US.  In the US, attendance at sporting events has been important in the bonding of Orthodox Jewish fathers and sons (daughters, too), and has been a terrific site for a shiddach date for couples (my daughter and son-in-law had their first date at a Nationals game).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Emanuel Feldman, a Mishpacha Magazine columnist and the rabbi emeritus of Congregation Beth Jacob in Atlanta, not to mention the brother of HaRav Aharon Feldman, shlita, Rosh HaYeshiva of Ner Israel, wrote how he attended a Braves World Series game, feeling somewhat guilty that he might be recognized as someone who has better things to do with his time than to surrender to his boy-hood passion for baseball.  In an article for <a href=\"http://www.tfdixie.com/special/feldman1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah from Dixie</a> he retells the story as an entertaining morality tale, also describing the pros and cons of his attendance.  At one point in the game, he athletically caught a foul ball which was seen by millions on television, and was the talk of Orthodox Jews around the world, even among those who do not watch television.  His catch was cheered by his Atlanta congregants and others in the US.  But at his Israeli home in the charedi Har Nof section of Israel, the reaction made him nervous and glad that his children were all married off.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to you is, \"it depends\" on your hashgafa and your standing in your community.

Does \"God's will\" only apply to moral decisions or is there a framework or guidelines/advice for identifying what God's will may be?</p>\n\n<p>For example, last week I stopped a fight between 2 guys (which you would think is a nice thing to do) but in hindsight I should have let them at each other because one of them probably deserved a bit and perhaps I have denied the universe it's intended outcome. How can I possibly <em>know</em> what God's will might have been in that situation? Is it completely implausible that God might have wanted one of them to get roughed up a bit in order to teach him a lesson he seemed to lack?

Surely God doesn't simply hand out rewards, we know he punishes those that transgress, at least I believe that.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, any advice on knowing God's will in a particular situation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>There's a lot to say about this. But one point to start with, re your fourth paragraph:</p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between what G-d wants to happen to a person, and who is to be the agent of it. In your example, one of these people may indeed deserve a beating, which will therefore happen one way or another,* but there's no Divine decree that this other person be the one to administer it; indeed, there is a commandment for him not to do so. So he has the free will to listen to what G-d has commanded (and similarly, you have free will to help him along in that, by doing something to dissuade him), and it is G-d's will that indeed that should be the case (in which case He will place that person in another situation where it can happen).</p>\n\n<p>[This is one of the classical explanations as to how G-d could punish the Egyptians for enslaving the Jews, when He had already decreed that they would be enslaved: it was the Egyptians' choice to be the agents who would carry it out, but they didn't have to do so. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1506.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Teshuvah 6:5)</a> ]</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>* Strictly speaking, even this is not necessarily true. The person may do teshuvah (repentance) and not have to undergo that after all, or G-d may decide to waive or postpone this punishment for other reasons. In any case, the general rule still applies: \"What business have you with G-d's secrets? You do what you are commanded [thus \"making His will your will\"], and G-d will do what He sees fit\" (Talmud, Berachos 10a).</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When it comes to other people your attitude to them must always be to save them from suffering. Whether they need, deserve or would benefit from suffering is not your concern <em>at all</em>. The only person I know about who tortured others (mentally) for their benefit is Joseph, and we do not have the capability of doing such a thing. If they need suffering it will come to them through some other agent of G-d. If you're seeing it then you have to do your best to stop it.</p>\n\n<p>When it come to oneself, a prerequisite for knowing G-d's will for you is profound self-knowledge. G-d's messages to an individual are directed to him specifically, but at the same time subtle and hidden from casual view. You need to sensitise yourself to hidden messages in your environment, people you meet, your household, and most of all your spouse (<em>Eizer k'negdo</em> and all that).</p>\n\n<p>While there are general principles which apply to everybody in the form of doing mitzvot and learning Torah, each person has their own special mission in life. You have to know your own nature and inclinations, strengths and weaknesses, abilities and shortcomings. To use a metaphor, what's your superpower? What's your kryptonite? Use your superpowers for good while avoiding your kryptonite in the extreme.</p>\n\n<p>It takes work to engender the humility needed to accept G-d's Will as your own. Ego-busting is by definition psychically painful, but the capability it gives you to deal with things outside your control is worth it.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is not easy to know Gd's will, but according to the Talmud and Mystical Judaism it is seemingly possible.  It seems from most stories, that only the best of the best have even come close to this ability, though of course all of us should strive to do so.</p>\n\n<p>First there are 2 main rules.**</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can never know what is Gd's will regarding other people, you can only know what is Gd's will for yourself.*</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are in a situation where you do not have control, then by definition whatever happens is Gd's will.  This is an outgrowth of rule 1.  The Torah (not just the chumash) can teach us what to do in any given situation, but when we have no power to change anything, we must accept that even though this might seem to go against Gd's will if we had the power to change it, since we do not, it is not His will that it be changed, or at least changed by us.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, the Tanach and Talmud are large, and cover many aspects of life.  Some are repeated, some go into great detail, some seemingly don't give us enough detail. There are halachot which have clear cut rules, and there agadatot which just make us think.  Once we have immersed ourselves in these stories and laws we will have enough information to understand Gd's will in any given moment. (I feel compelled to add that sometimes you will need expert knowledge in a related field, such as farming, to properly understand what the Torah tells us when it makes use of farming metaphors or laws.)</p>\n\n<p>As for the example of the two people fighting that you gave, we have many examples of two people fighting in our tradition when a third person could intercede. The results of interceding differed from case to case. For example, Moshe slew an Egyptian that was beating a Jewish slave (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0202.htm#11\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 2:11-12</a>), and he saw two Jews fighting and spoke to them to stop (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0202.htm#13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 2:13-14</a>). Aharon, writes the Talmud, would always stop two people from fighting - even lying to each of them if necessary - and for this, his ways were known as Peace, one of Gd's names. I believe there was also an incident with a prophet but I can't remember who at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>If, after learning enough Torah, a person sees two others fighting then they will be instantly reminded of one of these instances by the circumstances that surround the fight.  They will then recognize how to intervene. Unless I'm forgetting some instance in the Talmud, Midrashim or Tanach, I believe a person is also supposed to do their best to stop two people from fighting. Your ways should be of peace, you should always try to bring peace to others. Whatever punishments a person is meant to have, they will receive those punishments through your attempts to bring about peace. If there are sources which say otherwise, then that just means that each situation needs to be looked at more closely, and more instances of the copus of Torah integrated into a person before they can know Gd's will in these moments.</p>\n\n<p>*Because of rule 1, you can be certain that anytime someone decides to make a public statement about why event X or Y happened; but, they do not include their own actions as the cause of the event or their own repentance as a possible remedy for the event then they are probably wrong. If they include themselves, it does not mean they are correct; but, if they don't, it certainly means they are wrong.</p>\n\n<p>** It has been many years since I studied this topic, and I apologize that I can not remember the source of these two rules. If anyone has heard them before and knows of their source, I would be much obliged.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: It occurred to me that someone reading this answer might think that you have to know all of Torah before ever attempting to make your will Gd's will. I do not think this is true. You can use the Torah you do know to influence your will to be closer to Gd's will.  If you make a mistake, so be it; but, what you do not know at any particular moment is not really in your control. You can try to learn more on a topic before acting, but you shouldn't think that since you are limited in your knowledge that you should not even attempt to subjugate your will to that of Gd and Torah. There is a general rule in Jewish practice to do what you can, even if you can't do it perfectly, and this idea also extends from \"rule 2\".</p>\n\n\n",

Indeed, the entire reason we may not feed stray animals on שבת is that it is too much labor (טירחא) for us; if we do it for our own sake, not the animals', or, especially, if we do it in fulfillment of a custom, then there is no problem.

Further, if one is going to shake off his tablecloth anyway, then there is no greater טירחא in doing so out of doors (where there is an עֵרוב), in the direction of birds. Finally, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36229&pgnum=38\" rel=\"nofollow\">אשל אברהם</a> also writes the obvious היתר that one can feed pet birds, if he has any — birds that are dependent on him for sustenance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I understand that Judaism views free will as the freedom to choose between life and death (i.e. choose life and live), but does that mean the popular conception of free will is, in fact, non-existent? If I strive to do God's will, is there any room for some <em>additional</em> (not substitute) will of my own. Should I assume that God's will is concerned with <strong>everything</strong> or are there areas where I can contribute to the molding of the future world according to my own desires.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, am I an intelligent being or just a host populated by a soul that may be plotted on an analogue spectrum with outright ignorance on one extreme and Godliness on the other extreme?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As usual, there are many different authentic Jewish perspectives on this issue.  I only know the sources for the more chasidic/kabbalistic approaches to this question, as I think thy are the only ones who really have a satisfactory answer, however I am aware of other positions that appeal to other people more , and they feel that the other approach is the only satisfactory answer.  I apologize if I don't do the other positions justice.  </p>\n\n<p>In no particular order: (just the order I remember them in)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Nikudah HaBachira (Point of free will): This view of free will states that we only have free will in very few and limited instances.  For most people, most things are truly not an option. Killing someone is not something we will do, so when the opportunity comes for us to kill someone, we can't really say we used our freewill to abstain from it. (we hope) Some things are just too far from us to ever imagine doing. On the opposite spectrum, there are some things which we always do, and we don't really have free will to abstain from doing them. For example, scratching an itch.  As we progress in life, our \"point of free will\" shifts on various issues.  It is in these points that we are truly human and our own person, every other time we are either acting as an animal does, or as an angel does. (Doing Gd's will for either good or bad) At no point in our life, do we ever lose this single point of free will no matter how close to Hashem's will we make our own.</p></li>\n<li><p>Divine Spark: This view argues that enclosed in our overly animal body, we have a spark of the Divine and the infinite within us. Our soul, as your question implies is always aiming to attach itself to this divine spark and become part of Gd's infinite nature. Our free will is a mechanism which either pushes our soul towards the animal parts of our nature, or towards our divine nature, and the goal in life is to become \"one with Hashem\", and have His will be our will, and our will be His will. If all goes well, we lose our free will and just become part of Gd's.</p></li>\n<li><p>Everything is free will, but the greats get divine intervention: This position argues that Gd's will only exists on a very Macro level of existence.  Gd's will and plans are only interested in nations and species. We have complete free will to act as we like, and they will have no affect on Gd's plans nor will they help them or hurt them. The mitzvot are for our own benefit to become close to Hashem and understand the divine intellect. If we are able to achieve this lofty closeness to Hashem, then we will be worthy to be involved in the Divine plan, and miracles and divine intervention will happen for us. But those people are few and far between.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is no true free will:  There is a line in the Talmud which states that there is no free will, everything is predetermined except for one point, Our awe of Hashem.  Gd is in control of everything and the only question is if we attach ourselves to Hashem or we do not.  Some understand this gemora to be saying that the only thing in life we have control over is our attitude and reaction to the events around us.</p></li>\n<li><p>Law of Attraction: Every person has complete free will, and the Truth is that Hashem would like to make His will our will.  A person will have the life they think of for themselves, and the things that they need and know truly that they need, without doubt, will be given those things by Gd. As long as we keep the mitzvot as we understand them and attach ourselves to our Father in Heaven, Gd will move mountains and stars to get our will fulfilled, but if there is the slightest doubt in our minds, then the strong opinions and thoughts of others will override our own.</p></li>\n<li><p>Free will only exists for reward and punishment:  Nothing we can do will affect or change the divine plan.  Free will only exists so that we may rewarded or punished for the things we do.  When it comes to Gd's will, we can only do the mitzvot we know and hope that we act correctly. Other than following mitzvot and avoiding sin, we should not worry ourselves with Gd's will or larger plans.</p></li>\n<li><p>Partner in creation:  Gd wants us to follow his Mizvot to help bring creation closer to it's final goal.  We have complete free will in this matter. If we do not do the miztvot and do not repair the defects in the world, then they will not be repaired, and Gd's plan will be done by another generation, if they so choose to do so.  Our free will exists on the larger scale of perhaps we will help Hashem and His creation, or we will not help and be greedy people with no gratitude and no future.  In order to be a true partner in creation, we need complete independence of thought of action and to be made \"in the image of Gd\". When we make our will Gd's will, then we are just acting as ourselves to be a partner in the creation and Gd's plan, but we are still our own individuals.  The fact that we choose to partner with Hashem rather than be an adversary is what defines us.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know I'm missing some other points of view, but that's all I have time for for now, and can't remember what I'm missing.  Hopefully you will notice that many of these ideas complement each other and overlap each other.  (If anyone can give me sources for each of those points of view, I would be indebted to you.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Take a look at most philosophers description of free will. That is, one has free will in making a choice if had he been been different (had different desires, goals, wills, etc) he could have chosen to act otherwise. I think that the problems involved with God's plan are quite similar to those problems raised by arguments about a causal universe.</p>\n\n<p>Note however, that one has free will in that one can choose <em>not</em> to follow god's will.

    "title": "Is belief in a G-d a commandment?",
    "content": "# Is belief in a G-d a commandment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am studying to convert to Judaism and one of the questions I was asked was about the Ten Commandments.  I remember reading at that time that there was debate about the division of the statements Moses brought down on tablets and that they are, in Hebrew, more commonly called the \"Ten Statements\" than the \"Ten Commandments.\"  I am particularly interested in the \"first\" and whether or not it is considered a commandment to believe in G-d.  After all, how can a person be commanded to have a particular belief?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p><strong>Belief in God cannot possibly be a commandment.</strong></p>\n<p>A commandment is something one fulfills because he already believes in the one who is commanding it. Thus, a commandment to believe in the existence of the commander is an absurdity; it assumes in its fulfillment that it has already been fulfilled. (This argument was presented by R' Hasdai Crescas.)</p>\n<p>For this reason, many Rishonim did not count those first few words of the ten statements - \"I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage\" - as a commandment, but rather as an introductory line to the entire monologue. [There is a Talmudic statement, though, that the first two commandments came from God directly, and they are identified as the first two statements of the ten. How to count those two commandments is a discussion in itself.]</p>\n<p>Now, what to make of the Rambam, who counted belief in God as the first commandment, and tied it to this first verse of the ten commandments? The answer is proposed by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34946&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> in Rosh Amanah as follows:</p>\n<p>The commandment is not belief in God, but rather the belief that God has certain qualities, namely that He is independent of all other existences and that all other existences are dependent upon Him. This is evident from Rambam's description of this <em>mitzva</em> in the Mishna Torah (Hil. Yesodei Hatorah 1:1-3) (my own translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יסוד היסודות ועמוד החכמות לידע שיש שם מצוי ראשון והוא ממציא כל נמצא וכל הנמצאים משמים וארץ ומה שביניהם לא נמצאו אלא מאמתת המצאו. אם יעלה על הדעת שהוא אינו מצוי אין דבר אחר יכול להמצאות. ואם יעלה על הדעת שאין כל הנמצאים מלבדו מצויים הוא לבדו יהיה מצוי ולא יבטל הוא לבטולם שכל הנמצאים צריכין לו והוא ברוך הוא אינו צריך להם ולא לאחד מהם לפיכך אין אמתתו כאמתת אחד מהם.</p>\n<p>The cornerstone of cornerstones and the pillar of all wisdoms is to know that there is a first existence who brought into existence all existences, and all existences, the heavens and Earth and all that is in between would not exist without the truth of his existence. If it enters the mind that He does not exist, then nothing else is able to exist. And if it enters the mind that nothing else besides Him exists, then He alone will exist and He will not cease because they have, for all existences require Him and He, blessed is He, does not require them, nor any one of them. Therefore, His reality is not like theirs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A more detailed description of this idea can be found in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37945&st=&pgnum=467\" rel=\"noreferrer\">first of Rambam's thirteen principles</a>. Essentially, the commandment is that we should believe that God, whom it is already assumed that we believe in His existence, possesses the above qualities.</p>\n<p>What about the fact that I cannot command someone to believe something? A person believes what he believes; he cannot be forced. To this Abarbanel responds that the commandment is not to actually believe, but rather to contemplate. We are commanded not to blindly follow faith, but rather to strive toward knowledge and to weigh it approprately <em>to come to the conclusion</em> that the above is true. (Admittedly, I don't fully understand this concept, but it seems that given the information that is available to us and our traditions, it is reasonable that we come to the correct conclusion.)</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1454595\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> for more information.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is no question that knowing that Gd exists is a Commandment (Mitzvah).  It is listed as Mitzvah number 1 in <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/613.htm\">Rambam's list of 613</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>However, in Judaism we have an obligation to Know, and to learn, and to understand that Gd exists, not to believe, in the Western understanding of the word believe.</p>\n\n<p>As you state in your question, how can you force a person to believe something they don't, or how can you even ask them to? It's impossible!</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew word for \"faith\" or \"believe\" is Emuna. And there is certainly a mitzvah to have Emuna IN hashem, in addition to the mitzvah to know and understand that Gd exists.  The main difference here, is that in modern western colloquial speech we talk about \"Faith THAT Gd Exist\", instead of \"Faith IN Gd\". The difference is large.  One does not need Faith that a parent exists.  However, if a parent is abusive or doesn't follow up on their word, a child might lose faith in that parent.  The same meaning here is for Gd. We must trust that Hashem will provide for us, that He will keep his word, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The first commandment of the 10 commandments is that we should know and understand and have faith that Hashem, the creator of the World, is the same Gd that took us out of Egypt and deals kindly with the Jewish people.  We must build a relationship, learn about Gd's ways, and have faith In him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are different views among the <em>rishonim</em> whether this belief counts as one of the 613 mitzvos or is a more fundamental basis for all Judaism. Either way, it is definitely obligatory, and without the belief in God, Judaism is meaningless. </p>\n\n<p>Just as God commanded man to not believe in other gods, He also commanded us to believe in God. Someone who believes in a rain-god must work at eradicating this belief, perhaps by recognizing that the clouds and rain are not an interdependent force, but part of nature. Similarly, if one doesn't believe in God, he should work at recognizing God. For example, by recognizing that there has to be a source of the world's existence, or that the universe is too fine-tuned to have happened by chance. </p>\n\n\n",

To me, this implies a <em>gradual process</em> of moving a great deal of water.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we have midrashim which imply it was a suddenly occuring phenomenon, saving Nachshon from drowning. Also, the verses say Moshe stretched out his staff and the sea split <em>in response.</em></p>\n\n<p>If it was a miraculous, quick transition from sea to dry land, what was the strong wind for? Or am I interpreting it wrong?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I suggest that the purpose of the wind was so that people who chose to doubt the miraculous nature of the splitting had something with which to rationalize it.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi (in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7988/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shaar HaYichud VehaEmunah, ch. 2</a>) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהוליך ה׳ את הים ברוח קדים עזה כל הלילה ויבקעו המים, ונצבו כמו נד וכחומה. ואילו הפסיק ה׳ את הרוח, כרגע היו המים חוזרים ונגרים במורד כדרכם וטבעם, ולא קמו כחומה, בלי ספק</p>\n<p>\"For then, G‑d drove back the sea by a strong east wind all the night, and the waters were split and not merely ceased their flow, but stood upright as a wall. If G‑d had stopped the wind, the waters would have instantly flowed downward, as is their way and nature, and undoubtedly they would not have stood upright like a wall.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the splitting indeed occurred at a single moment, but then the wind had to continue blowing in order to prevent the water from crashing back down.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Ran in his drashos (end of drasha 11) explains that if the Egyptians had realised that there was a miracle going on, they wouldn't have thrown themselves into the sea.

He led them away against their will, for the Egyptians had adorned their steeds with ornaments of gold, silver, and precious stones, and the Israelites were finding them in the sea. The plunder at the sea was greater than the plunder in Egypt, as it is said: “We will make you rows of gold with studs of silver” (Song of Songs 1:11). Therefore, he had to lead them against their will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873/showrashi/true#v36\">Shemot 12:36, Rashi says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and they emptied out:</strong> Heb. וַיְנַצְלוּ.

(Indeed, the command (Ex. 11:2) was that the Jews should request \"each man from his neighbor, and each woman from her neighbor\" - pretty clearly excluding the royal household.) So when the Torah says that they had \"emptied out Egypt,\" it must be referring to the belongings of the common people.</p>\n\n<p>(Which also would explain how the plunder from the drowning of the army exceeded what they took away from Egypt: in an autocratic monarchy like Egypt, the king's wealth probably far exceeded that of all his subjects combined.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Yalkut Meam Loez famously lists 50 individual miracles that happened within the miracle of Kriyas Yam Suf. Number 45 notes that although the Bnei Yisrael took all the riches from Egypt on the way out, that was only from individual people. The royal treasures remained intact. They were taken by Pharaoh in the pursuit of the Bnei Yisrael and were washed up ashore for the Jews to take following the death of the Mitzriyim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי כן דרך האנשים שספינתם נטרפת בים והם ניצולים שאינם חושבים עוד על רכושם אע\"פ שהוא רב. ומלבד זה שלח להם הקב\"ה סכום גדול אחר שכל מה שהיה להם קודם היה כאין וכאפס לפני זה בשעה שיצאו מן הים. כי זה היה הגורם השלישי להתעשרותם. כי הקב\"ה גזר על שר של ים שיפליט את המצריים יחד עם רכבם שהיו מלאים כסף וזהב ואבנים טובות ומרגליות. <strong>כי אע\"פ שראינו בפרשת בא שבנ\"י עשו את מצרים כמצולה שאין בה דגים, זהו מה שלקחו מאת המון העם. אבל מן המלכות עצמה לא נטלו כלום</strong>. אבל כשיצאו לרדוף אחרי בני ישראל קישט את כל הסוסים באבנים טובות ומרגליות ומילא את הרכב בכסף וזהב והרבה כרכרות מלאות כל טוב בלי מספר, כדי שעי\"כ יהיה למצרים חשק ללכת אחרי בנ\"י</p>\n<p>Because so is the way of people whose ship is wrecked at sea and they are survivors who no longer think about their property even though it is large. And yet, Hashem sent them (the Egyptians) another large sum of which everything they had before was nothing (in comparison) at the time they went out from the sea. Thus, this was the third way they (the Bnei Yisrael) became rich. Because Hashem decreed (lit.) an officer (i.e. an angel) of the sea to deliver the Egyptians along with their chariots full of silver and gold and precious stones and pearls. <strong>Since even though we saw in Parshas Bo that the Jewish people made the Egypt like a deep sea without fish (i.e. emptied them of wealth) - this is what they had taken from the masses of the people, but from the kingdom itself they took nothing</strong>. So when they (the Egyptians) went out to pursue the children of Israel, they adorned all the horses with precious stones and pearls and filled the chariots with silver and gold and many chariots full of all good things without number, so that by doing so, Egypt would have a desire to go after the children of Israel...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition it is worth noting later that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.14.31.1?ven=Mechilta,_translated_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&vhe=Mekhilta_--_Wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta 14:31</a> adds that there were four reasons why the Jewish people saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

Does that apply to lighting the havdalah candle?  I have never learned that women who don't daven (pray) ma'ariv, but who make havdalah themselves, should do anything special first before lighting the candle, but isn't lighting the candle melacha?  Should a woman who makes her own havdalah always say \"baruch...\" first and then proceed with havdalah?  Or does melacha that is required for havdalah have some special status that makes this not a concern?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>Yes.  Women should formally end shabbat before lighting a havdala candle after shabbat has ended, i.e. after nightfall on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, women certainly <em><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11891/759\">can</a></em> daven maariv and say attah chonantanu.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Rama in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=152\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 299:10</a> quotes an opinion that the only reason labor is forbidden before havdala is lest one forget to say havdala. Accordingly, one could do non-labor intensive work immediately after shabbat, including lighting a candle. The Rama suggests that this opinion is why many are lenient regarding the prohibition on labor before havdalah. However, he and many later poskim hold that the halacha should not be in accordance with this view, and it would thus be proper to recite maariv or 'baruch hamavdil' before lighting the havdala candle.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Be'er Heitiv (on the page there) advocates teaching the women (who at the time were largely uneducated) to refrain from lighting candles until formally ending shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Say \"Baruch HaMavdil bein Kodesh LeChol\" -- blessed is He who separates between sacred and ordinary.

Firstly we don't delay mitzvahs; more importantly, you're not allowed to eat/drink anything (other than water) once the time for Havdalah has come, until you've made Havdalah.

The 5 things are those mentioned in the pasuk in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0411.htm\">Bamidbar 11:5</a>: Kishuim Avatichim Chatzir Betzalim and Shumim (I don't know if these are actually their modern Hebrew equivalents, but if they are then they are all vegetables).</p>\n\n<p>Your question is only according to the latter opinion.</p>\n\n<p>I think the man could not become meat for two reasons. First, if the man could turn into meat, why did the Jews complain about not having meat? We see they did complain about the lack of these five things. Additionally, they complain in the pasuk above about a sixth thing, fish, yet the talmud does not record fish among the exceptions to tastes. Thus it seems that it could not taste like fish, but that was no cause to be an exception, implying a more general and known excluded category, likely meat.</p>\n\n<p>So there was no way to have meat and milk man.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even if there would be, I submit that it would be muttar.

It seems to me that all opinions would agree to exclude man as it is at best a 'plant'.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Finally I would like to echo avi's sentiment in the comments above, that the pasuk tells us explicitly in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0411.htm\">Bamidbar 11:8</a> that the man tasted like \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/dining/09manna.html?ref=dining\">cake baked with oil</a>\".

Thus, the only way to re-warm him would be to arouse his yetzer hara again. Therefore, they brought a woman to stand in his room (which was allowed since Yichud was waived for David), but not to touch him (since, according to R' Schwab, Negiah would surely not be waived). The battle of seeing the woman in his room and making rationalizations, etc. would be the inner struggle which would help heat him up.</p>\n<p>Rav Schwab adds that even though the Pasuk says \"She will lie in your bosom,\" this was just the advice of the doctors to David, and David did not necessarily follow this advice.</p>\n\n\n",

The gemara then quotes Rabbi Yochanan (see above).</p>\n\n<p>So, I would think that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah was saying he never looked at the actual face of a wicked person, based on the Rabbi Yochanan's teaching that even the image of his face is forbidden to stare at.</p>\n\n<p>On a related note, when I was learning from Rabbi Shamai Warman (a teacher of mine), ShLIT\"A, he taught us that it is a good thing to look at the face of a tzaddik (righteous person).  If I recall correctly, according to Midrash, Yoseph saw the face of his father Yaakov when he was secluded with Potiphar's wife, and it was on account of having the image of the tzaddik embedded in his mind then that he fled from her.

    "content": "# The size/shape of biblical Israel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=28&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Tosafot in Bava Metzia 28a (D\"H Chamisha Asar Yom)</a>, Eretz Israel is a square (400 sq. Parsah), and the distance between Jerusalem and the Jordan river is 1/39th the distance between Jerusalem and the Mediterranean Sea (or maybe another border). Based on our maps I can't seem to figure it out. Is there any angle to look at the map that all this works out? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question reminds me of this map of the earth based on Herodotus c.450 BCE:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q1wYf.jpg\" alt=\"Herodotus 450 BCE\"></p>\n\n<p>In all seriousness, let's do the math. Jerusalem to the Jordan River is roughly 13 miles. Something 39 times the distance would be just over 500 miles. Jerusalem to the Mediterranean is however roughly 31 miles. That's less than 3 times the distance. (Or maybe there was a branch of the Jordan River that was less than one mile from Jerusalem back then.) In fact, I can't find anything significant at a distance of 500 miles (forgive the bad circle):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/u3DLa.jpg\" alt=\"500 miles from Jerusalem\"></p>\n\n<p>But as you can see, you may hit the top corner of the Mediterranean if you could assume Jerusalem expanded a few miles Eastwards. Because that's 350 miles away, meaning Jerusalem would have to be within 9 miles of the Jordan, meaning Jerusalem needed to be 4 miles wider to the east.</p>\n\n<p>On to the next part of your math, 400 square parsa would mean 20 parsa by 20 parsa. A parsa could be 2.4 or 2.9 miles, so I'll go with 2.9 here. You're saying Israel is just under 60x60 miles. That would look like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f7qWm.png\" alt=\"60x60 mile Israel\"></p>\n\n<p>Close, but I think Biblical Israel was a little taller than that. Maybe it doesn't mean a literal square.</p>\n\n<p>And just for fun, if you meant 400x400 parsas, which I'll use the 2.4 mile calculation, would mean Isreal is 960x960 miles. That would make it look something like this (pretty sweet!):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/llzzs.jpg\" alt=\"960x960 miles\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maybe this Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.57a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 57a</a> is a place to start.</p>\n<p>The Gemara says that Tur Malka used to be able to hold 1,800,000,000,000,000 people before the churban could not even hold 600,000 reeds after the churban.  The Gemara says that Eretz Yisroel expanded to hold the people that lived there and once they were exiled the land shrunk.</p>\n<p>Even if you say that those numbers are exaggerated I think the idea might help to answer this question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps the measurement is surface area, not \"as the crow flies\" area</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9975#showrashi=true&v=11\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 11:11</a> tells us the Eretz Yisrael is full of mountains and valleys.

    "content": "# Using an oven timer on Shabbas\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is my first post here.</p>\n\n<p>I'm fairly familiar with cooking on Shabbat, but I have a few specific questions.</p>\n\n<p>I know there are issues with using the warming setting on an oven to keep food warm. Mostly around opening the door causing the heating element to (eventually) turn on, which is why many hold that you need to take everything out of the oven at one time.</p>\n\n<p>What about these two cases:</p>\n\n<p>1) Fully cooked food is in the oven (on a warming setting) before Shabbas begins. I set the timer so the oven turns off just before I'd want to serve the food. So the oven is still warm, but off. Can I then take one item out at a time, and leave the rest in the still warm, but off, oven?</p>\n\n<p>2) If you rely on the the opinions <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12627/using-a-plata-on-shabbat\">here</a> that fully cooked (dry) food could be reheated on Shabbas. Would you be able to put the cold (dry) food into an oven that off at 10:00, and have a timer set that would turn the warming function on at 10:15 and off again at 12:30, and then remove the food after it's turned off at 12:30?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>#1 seems OK.

Care must be taken to set up the warming area so that it complies with an abnormal cooking method  like placing the food on top of another pot of food that was placed there prior to shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The timer is an issue as well.  See my timer discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10358/may-one-use-a-computer-script-to-do-something-specifically-on-shabbos-yom-tov\">here</a> based on Igros Moshe <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC IV 60</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I hope to put in appropriate sources soon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding question 2</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-cooking-ovenshabbos.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-cooking-ovenshabbos.htm</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My oven and warming drawer have a delayed start timer feature.

A Pidyon HaBen is mandated for the first male child to \"open\" the mother's womb. But whose Mitzvah is it? </p>\n\n<p>The Pasuk is in the masculine. Does that mean it is the father's obligation? Do both parents share the obligation? EDIT (NEW SUB-QUESTION): Can the mother fulfill it if it's the father's responsibility?</p>\n\n<p>There is a famous story that a famous rabbi (the GR\"A, perhaps?) would, whenever he made the acquaintance of a Kohen, ask immediately for the opportunity to perform a Pidyon for himself (because of a safek that he felt existed in every Kohen's lineage). </p>\n\n<p>Assuming the Safek was strong enough that the rabbi had reason to fear that his previous Pidyon(im) did not fulfill the Mitzvah, was it his responsibility to seek out more Kohanim to try again, or was that the sole responsibility of his father (or parents) to be fulfilled when he was a minor?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiddushin 29a</a>) derives that the obligation to redeem lies solely on the father, and then the son himself if the father did not redeem him.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch rules this way in YD <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=266\" rel=\"nofollow\">305:1</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=271\" rel=\"nofollow\">305:15</a> and explicitly excludes the mother in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=266\" rel=\"nofollow\">305:2</a>. I don't know of anyone who debates these rulings.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of your story, I have heard a similar story about the Gr\"a. This position though is not generally practiced, and we usually assume that our kohanim are good enough. Additionally, there is a rule of 'HaMotzi MeiChaveiro Alav HaRaayah' -- someone who wants to take money from his friend must bring the proof. So here, once the pidyon has been done once (by father or son once he is a bar mitzva) then every future kohen would have to prove it invalid before claiming money for himself. The position of the Gr\"a seems to be a personal stringency at best.</p>\n\n\n",

Part of his proof of this point is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'שהרי קודם מתן תורה אי אפשר לומר (פסוק טז) והודעתי את חקי וגו</p>\n<p>Before the giving of the Torah it was impossible to say (verse 16), “and I make known the statutes, etc.,” [since the statutes had not yet been given].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How so? Previously (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=15562&p=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to 15:25</a>), Rashi has informed us that Hashem already gave the Jews some mitzvos at Marah: Shabbos, the Red Heifer, and civil laws. (In the commentary to Deut. 5:16, he also adds the mitzvah of honoring parents.) In the weeks before that they had been taught the twenty mitzvos (according to Rambam's enumeration) in Parashas Bo, including the topics of Rosh Chodesh, the Pesach offering, Yom Tov, and sanctifying firstborn sons and animals. Going back even further, they had the seven Noachide laws and all of their corollaries, plus the various mitzvos and customary practices that they had received from the Avos and from Amram (see Rambam, Hil. Melachim 9:1).</p>\n<p>So they had quite a respectable amount of Torah law to cover already by the time they arrived at Mount Sinai. Why, then, does Rashi consider it impossible that Yisro could have seen Moshe judging and instructing the people before the Torah was given?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3111&st=&pgnum=153\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nimukei Rashi</a> (who spends several pages discussing this) understands that it was clear to Rashi already from the sequence of events as they are related in Sefer Devarim that this episode of Yisro's advice happened right after Moshe descended from Har Sinai (which is what \"ויהי ממחרת\" is referring to). However, it is not entirely clear which descending this took place after, for Moshe descended from the mountain several times.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify this, Rashi writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרי קודם מתן תורה אי אפשר לומר (פסוק טז) והודעתי את חקי וגו', ומשנתנה תורה עד יום הכיפורים לא ישב משה לשפוט את העם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it had to be post-Matan Torah and also with enough time for Moshe to be around judging the people, which is not until he descended the final time on Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n<p>But that which Rashi is learning from \"וְהוֹדַעְתִּי אֶת חֻקֵּי הָאֱ־לֹהִים וְאֶת תּוֹרֹתָיו\" that this was post-Matan Torah is not because there were no laws to be taught until then, for as you noted, there were laws beforehand as well. Rather, Rashi is learning specifically from the language of \"וְהוֹדַעְתִּי\", which implies that he was \"making known\" to the people things that were previously unknown to them.</p>\n\n<p>That is, the laws of Marah and other laws that they already had were already well-known, and even if they needed clarification in minor points or reiteration, this doesn't warrant the language of \"וְהוֹדַעְתִּי\". It implies that Moshe was delivering laws that were completely knew to the people, which could only be after he had received the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Especially with respect to marriage and divorce, consult your Rabbi about your situation for practical guidance.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(A pilegesh (commonly translated as \"concubine\") is a woman who has a halachically sanctioned relationship with a man but is not married to him. The relationship has many (but not all)  of the same qualities as a full marriage.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>May a man take a woman as a pilegesh today, according to halacha?</p></li>\n<li><p>Why (or why not) is pilegesh permitted today?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>As Rabbi Yissochar Frand concludes on his shiur on the subject, \"as we say in the kashrut world ... it's <em>not recommended.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>As Rabbi Rakeffet points out, just using the term in your native language makes a difference here. He mentions that when he first moved to Israel if someone called him a <em>chamor</em> (\"donkey\") he thought it was cute, but to a native speaker it's quite the insult! Similarly he had an American woman argue for non-marital relations, saying \"it's no worse than <em>pilegesh</em>\", to which he replied -- \"oh so you want to be some man's concubine?\" That made her pause.</p>\n\n<p>More from Rabbi Frand: Probably the most serious proposal for reinstituting the Pilegesh in (relatively) modern times was Rabbi Yaakov Emden's. He was concerned with the case of Jewish men who would move to America to work, leaving a wife behind in Europe (with plans that eventually he'd make enough money to bring her over, or he'd return home, or something) ... and years pass and he's still living on his own in America -- and as the Rambam concludes his Laws of Prohibitions on Relations, well -- celibacy is hard! Such a man can't \"marry\" a woman in America, as doing so would violate the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11040/questions-about-polygamy-in-jewish-law-and-culture\">ban on polygamy</a>. Instead Rabbi Emden suggested \"concubinage\", which would have been a marriage in every way but name. It would involve <em>kiddushin</em> and would require a <em>Get</em> to terminate; the only thing it would be missing is it would not require a <em>ketubah</em> contract -- and even that, Rabbi Emden advises that they draw up a similar contract for her financial protection.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier in history, it was debated whether a <em>pilegesh</em> requires <em>kiddushin</em> to enter and a <em>Get</em> to absolve, but that was Rabbi Emden's conclusion. The medieval rabbis debated whether the Biblical commandment to have children necessarily required full marriage (with ketubah and all the obligations thereof), or if concubinage would have theoretically been an alternative. Some (Rambam if I'm not mistaken) were of the opinion this was only a legal allowance for anointed kings -- as the Torah makes clear, <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=17\" rel=\"noreferrer\">kings have some special rules</a>. Ramban counters by observing that the Book of Judges ends with a story involving a man and his concubine -- and quite clearly, \"<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0721.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in those days there was no king in Israel</a>\"! The closest this man could have been was a \"judge\", who had some king-like authority, but still, if so, where do you draw the line, asks Ramban? So a commoner can't have a concubine, but a judge can? What about, say, a president of a major jewish organization? A millionaire CEO? The president of the local synagogue? (Note: <em>If you are a synagogue president and reading this, I am not condoning non-monogamy. This is a thought experiment contained within a theoretical discussion!</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Between all the halachic questions about how Pilegesh works, and for whom; the reluctance to mess with the way things have been done for 2000 years easily; and the general understanding that Judaism values traditional marriage (according to many, even if Pilegesh is an option, real marriage is a bigger mitzva), it's just not recommended today.</p>\n\n<p>As I like to quote, in Spain in the early 1400s they did one better -- \"well if the bachelors and idiots are going to do their business anyway, better that it be without sinning seriously\" -- and some rabbis provided \"official grace, and communal funds\" towards all-Jewish houses-of-ill-repute. Rabbi Isaac Arama (in an essay on understanding Biblical Sodom) was furious about this practice; it's one thing for individuals to have their struggles, it's another for society to enshrine their shortcomings into official public policy. The \"official grace\" described by Rabbi Arama was interpreted by R' Chaim Ozer Grozinski as having them all use the mikvah; I've heard Rabbi Yehoshua Grunstein say it meant conducting a <em>pilegesh</em> arrangement every time a um, client, showed up -- which points to your question. (I do not know what Rabbi Grunstein's sources are on this interpretation of Arama's essay.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>A very relevant question in the present day!</p>\n\n<p>I think you are mistaken in saying that the pilegesh relationship is any more lightweight or temporary than traditional marriage. A pilegesh has all the restrictions and rights of a wife (such as adultery for other men and maintenance by her husband), and for a man and woman to casually enter into a concubine relationship is similar to a quickie wedding with no serious intention.</p>\n\n<p>While Wikipedia is not always dependable, their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilegesh\">article</a> mentions all the ideas I have heard about concubines.</p>\n\n<p>I remain unsure why a man would take a woman as a concubine rather than straight out marrying her, since practically speaking there are only tiny differences between the two arrangements [no ketubah if (or more likely <strong>when</strong>) they divorce or he dies]. The attitude to taking a concubine should be no different to getting properly married, and we don't treat marraige as a casual arrangement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Ramban's view is that is it not forbidden from the Tora, but still you are not allowed to have a Mistress. He states that the restriction is to diminish the chance of Issur Niddah which is even worse than Zera Levatala (which the Zohar states that even Tshuva does not repent for that crime...)</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam states that it is De'oraita. Although in Hilchos Melochim (4, 4) he states that it is not forbidden for a Jewish king. The Raavad (there) disagrees with the Rambam and states that he thinks it not borbidden even for \"simple Jews\" (Pshutei Am), the Ya'avetz (2, 15) concludes that it is likely that it is not forbidden. </p>\n\n<p>Almost all other Poiskim conclude that it is forbidden (either Derabanan or DeOraita).</p>\n\n\n",

The simplest translation of the term is \"those who change (or differ).\" The Targum translates the term as \"שטיי\", fools or madmen. (Targum uses the same term earlier (Proverbs 8:5) when translating the term כסילים.)</p>\n\n<p>The commentaries understand this in a number of ways. Most understand it to mean simply those whose behavior differs from the laws of God (and the king). (Ibn Ezra, Ralbag, Metzudas David) The Malbim explains the verse in a very straightforward manner, \"Fear God, my son, as well as the king, and don't associate with those who wish to change the government.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (Sotah 22a) gives a midrashic interpretation that the word means \"those who study\" and refers to those who study the Mishnah independently without rabbinic guidance (which leads to errors in halachic practice). (Another possible interpretation is also mentioned, \"those who repeat\" - referring to those who sin repeatedly.)</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's commentary, that the word \"שונים \" refers to \"those who say there are two powers\" - \"האומרים שתי רשויות יש\", comes from a midrash. (I found a source that gives this commentary also in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, but I don't know the original source for that.) Yalkut Shimoni quotes the midrash as saying, \"אותם שאומרים שני אלוהות בעולם\" - \"Those who say that there are two gods in the world.\" This is a fairly straightforward concept, and could be a direct reference to Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, and even Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>The question is why Rashi chose to emphasize this particular midrashic interpretation over the simple meaning (as well as other midrashic interpretations that are closer to the simpler meaning). Unfortunately, I am not aware of any good commentary on Rashi on Mishlei (akin to the numerous such commentaries on Rashi's commentary on Chumash such as Mizrachi and Sifsei Chachamim).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R.

This is in contrast to the Jewish belief that Gd Creates both Good and Bad.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Sometimes, you there is such a large divide between philosophies, that merely being around each other will not bridge that divide.  With Dualists, there is nothing you will be able to do to convince them that really all comes from one Source.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Yes.  There are two distinct authorities, Gd and Just governments.. however, Gd is also Lord and King.</p>\n\n<p>(4) When it comes to Dualists, there is a danger in mingling with them.  The danger, is that since they believe there are two major forces in the world, one good and one bad, they can always attribute any action to either the Good force or the Evil force.  This creates a relativism that can lead to bad character traits.  When a person recognizes that everything in life comes from Gd, and therefore, even the Evil in the world has a purpose and will ultimately come to some good, it greatly changes a person's perspective.  It means they will try to make the best out of a situation, and any successes they attribute to Gd, and any failures they will attribute to Gd's will as well.  Since you could never convince a Dualist of this possibility, hanging out with them will just cause you trouble.  However, since the pasuk references \"my son\", it's very possible that this advice is only given to the average person, and not to someone who is prepared and well learned, and guarded against the negative influences of a Dualists' perspective in life.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot lacking in my answer, but hopefully it will be a springboard to further study regarding how Jewish tradition views followers of Dualist philosophies, and explain why there is a desire to avoid Zugim (pairs) in many instances.</p>\n\n\n",

The floor has soft mats. The reason explained to me is that it's done as a form of greeting to a person. In general, the gesture recognizes that you are submitting and giving respect to the person to whom you are bowing, as at that moment they could cut your head off! </p>\n\n<p>Another explanation:</p>\n\n<p>Bowing in Kung-Fu will take various different forms; not surprising as there are hundreds, if not thousands, of individual styles from various families and various regions all throughout China.</p>\n\n<p>In China, bowing (especially the traditional kowtow) serves as a sign of reverence. Modernly (following Imperialisms decline in China), the kowtow has been replaced by the standing bow in many formal situations. Bowing is also common under Buddhist traditions, especially when honoring both the student-teacher relationship, as well as in honoring ancestors and memories of predecessors.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, bows may be used in apology. As @BenCole said in one of his comments to the original question, this may be a way of bearing the neck in a sign of supplication, but is commonly used by political and celebrity figures to show remorse for a perceived fault.</p>\n\n<p>Bows in Chinese martial arts tend not to be as strict as bows in Japanese martial arts, as bowing is not such a formalized practice in China any longer. The core ties are, however, to both Buddhist and Confucian traditions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Generally a Dojo has a soft mat on which you kneel, and the bowing is done as a form of greeting to a person.</p>\n\n<p>As long as you are not kneeling on a stone floor, it's <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920167/jewish/Chapter-Five.htm\">not strictly a problem.</a> (Halacha commentary 14)</p>\n\n<p>As for fears of Avodah Zarah in regards to Kung Fu, you should in general not be exposed to anything. If you are exposed to concepts and teachings which smell of Avodah Zarah to you, then you should switch Dojos, as most Kung Fu teachers and practitioners do not incorporate any avodah Zarah teachings into their lessons.  As you mention in your question there are hundreds of variants, so if you hear things which seem fishy to you, switch Dojos.</p>\n\n\n",

Most Ashkenazim have a (<em>somewhat</em>) similar pronunciation to Sefardim (For example, Sefardim would say \"Baruch\" while Ashkenazim would say \"Boruch\"). Moreover, Poland had a closer connection to Lithuania (they were under a joint Monarchy before both being swallowed up by the Russian Empire) than to Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there are videos of the Lubavitcher Rebbe (who was from Dnepropetrovsk which is in the center of Ukraine), and he speaks with a \"conventional\" pronunciation. </p>\n\n<h2>In Short,</h2>\n\n<p>Where and why did the different pronunciations start?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Not really a complete answer, but the Jews in these countries arrived from different places and at different times. For example, most Polish Jews came from Germany, while early Ukrainian Jewry <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seems</a> to have come from the Byzantine empire and/or from the Khazar kingdom. So it is not too surprising that they had different accents.</p>\n\n<p>[We tend to lump all of the Jews of Christian Europe together as \"Ashkenazim,\" but strictly speaking, originally there were several cultural areas, each with their own customs; for example, Knaan (Bohemia and nearby areas) and Hagar (Hungary) were distinct from Ashkenaz (western Germany). Ashkenazic Jewry simply came to dominate all of them, probably by a combination of sheer numbers and a higher level of Torah knowledge. Much the same happened with the older communities of the Ottoman Empire that were swamped by the Sephardim expelled from Spain, and so mostly lost their old minhagim.]</p>\n\n<p>Some of these differences did develop only later - for example, Polish/Hungarian \"ee\" vs. other Ashkenazic \"oo\" for shuruk (see my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10183/37\">here</a>). It's also possible that this had to do with what sounds existed in the local non-Jewish languages; this is similar to the way that general Ashkenazic pronunciation has lost all of the Hebrew guttural and emphatic consonants, because they don't exist in the European languages.</p>\n\n\n",

Can I use the money in the Pushkah for the Chinese auction? Same organization, new motivation.

If not, the money will come from ma’aser and go to the organization.</strong> [See Sefer Tzedakah Umishpat from R’ Yaakov Bloi page 31 who also gives this solution] R’ Zucker ruled that this stipulation should really be made in all situations where one buys raffle tickets even when there is an unlimited amount over a prolonged period. Being that there are Poskim [R’ Taub quoting HaGaon Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv Shlita and R’ Shmuel Felder quoting Hagon Rav Shlomo Zalman zt”l] who say that even in such a case one should not use maaser money making the above stipulation avoids all issues since one is not considered to have benefited from maaser in any way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above quote, <a href=\"http://www.cckollel.org/html/parsha/shemos/tetzaveh5763.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">found here</a>, gives a formula by which one may use maaser / tzedakah money for a Chinese Auction (a.k.a. raffle).</p>\n\n<p>The question also asks whether previously set aside money for an organization can be used to purchase a ticket for a raffle run by that same organization.</p>\n\n<p>Using the stipulation quoted above, it would seem that handing over the money to the organization by means of a losing raffle ticket is no different than giving it to them directly.</p>\n\n<p>Since you have stipulated that any <em>winning</em> raffle ticket is retroactively considered to have been purchased from your own money - if you win, you would then \"owe\" the original price of the raffle ticket (NOT the value of the prize!) to the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Now - what if one had already placed money into a pushka (charity box) with intent to give that money to a specific organization? Can that money be used to buy raffle tickets from the same organization?</p>\n\n<p>If the pushka is in your own home, the money still belongs to you.  You have merely designated your own money to give to organization X. </p>\n\n<p>If you empty the pushka to buy Chinese auction tickets from organization X, they have still received the money.  Putting money in a box at home is NOT like \"hekdesh\" (consecrating an object for Temple use).  For example, if you suddenly needed change for the parking meters, you could take the money back.  (It is unclear whether or not you would then \"owe\" an equal amount of money to that organization.)</p>\n\n<p>This is all true because of the concept of tova'as hanaa.  Tova'as hanaa is the power of choice that a charity giver has when distributing his charity funds.</p>\n\n<p>This power of choice is considered valuable enough <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/kidushin/insites/kd-dt-058.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">to marry a woman with it (in lieu of a ring)</a> </p>\n\n<p>So, just because you put your own money in your own box, with organization X in mind, that doesn't remove your tova'as hanaa on the money.  Certainly if you could legally use the money for a completely separate purpose, you could use it to buy charity raffle tickets.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Presumably the money in the tzedahkah box is for tzedakah.</p>\n\n<p>Money spent at a chinese auction, does not count as Tzedekah since you are receiving the possibility of gaining an item for the money spent.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you plan to give any item you win the auction to Charity as well, then I presume you could use the money from the Tzedakah box to do so.  If such an idea seems crazy to you, then I think you have a better understanding of whether or not this is being done for tzedakah or your own possible personal gain.</p>\n\n\n",

Once I have been out-bid, do I still need to keep that money in reserve in case the people above me retract, or (per Jewish law) is that not my problem because that would be impracticel in auctions structured as they usually are now?</p>\n\n<p>(I don't actually participate in auctions this way and would consult my rabbi if this mattered, but I was curious upon reading this mishna.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The auction in this mishnah is dealing with buying from hekdesh.  Hekdesh, or the property of the Temple) always has the upper hand in negotiations because stealing from the Temple is the sin of Meila.

A few that I can think of are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Nochum (נָחוּם) - is written in Tanach (Nah. 1:1) as נַחוּם (with a patach under the nun).</p></li>\n<li><p>Yerachmiel (יְרַחְמִיאֵל) - is written in Tanach (Jer. 36:26; I Chron. 2:9 passim, and 24:29) as יְרַחְמְאֵל (with a sheva under the mem, and no second yud).</p></li>\n<li><p>Yeruchom (יְרֻחָם) - is written in Tanach (I Sam. 1:1; Neh. 11:12; I Chron. 6:12,19, 8:27, 9:8,12, 12:8, 27:22; II Chron. 23:1) as יְרֹחָם (with a cholam following the reish).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Where do these variants come from? And in the case of Yerachmiel, where the spelling (not just the pronunciation) is different, does halachah recognize the popular spelling as valid for use in official documents like kesubos and gittin, or is the Biblical form supposed to be used?</p>\n\n<p>(There are others, such as Yeshayah/u and Yirmiyah/u, where both forms are found in Tanach. My question is about ones such as those listed above, where all usages of each name are spelled and pronounced the same way each time.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some others mentioned in comments (thanks all):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Daniel (דָּנִיאֵל) - is written in Tanach (in the book of that name, as well as in Ez. 8:2, Neh. 10:7 and I Chron. 3:1) as דָּנִיֵּאל (with the tzeirei under the yud, which also has a dagesh).</p></li>\n<li><p>Basyah (בַּתְיָה) - is written in Tanach (I Chron. 4:18) as בִּתְיָה (with a chirik under the beis). (That may have been influenced by the Midrash, Vayikra Rabbah 1:3, in which Hashem, so to speak, adopts her as His daughter - בַּת יָ-הּ - in recognition of her having done the same for Moshe.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Shamshon (שַׁמְשׁוֹן) - is written in Tanach (Judg. 13:25 passim) as שִׁמְשׁוֹן (with a chirik under the first shin). (That may have been influenced by the non-Jewish form, originally from the Septuagint.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Tuviah (טוּבְיָה) - is written in Tanach (Zech. 6:10,14; Ez. 2:60; Neh. 3:35 passim; II Chron. 17:8) as טוֹבִיָּה (with a cholam after the tes, a chirik under the veis and a dagesh in the yud). That one might actually imply a difference in meaning: Tuviah - \"the goodness of G-d\"; Toviah - \"G-d is good.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I'll address part of the question, viz:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in the case of Yerachmiel, where the spelling (not just the pronunciation) is different, does halachah recognize the popular spelling as valid for use in official documents like kesubos and gittin, or is the Biblical form supposed to be used?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The former: <em>halacha</em> supports the popular spelling. <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> (<em>EH</em> 129) writes (in my own loose translation, with any questionable translation marked in brackets with question mark [thus?]):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ירחמיאל</em> we write like that [in a <em>get</em>], with a <em>yod</em> after the <em>mem</em>. There's a dispute among the <em>pos'kim</em> about this, but that's how the <em>Bes Sh'muel</em> decided: that around these parts people typically write it with a <em>yod</em>. All the more so for us, who [stress?] the <em>mem</em> with a <em>chirik</em>. This is unless the man in question signs his name [by repute?] without a <em>yod</em>, in which case you should write \"ירחמאל, who's called ירחמיאל\", for..., since we pronounce it with a <em>chirik</em>, it's a different name [from that in <em>Divre Hayamim</em>], so we must write \"who's called\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I see also that the <em>Bes Sh'muel</em> (129) says about <em>Y'rucham</em> that if someone's name is pronounced that way (with a <em>shuruk</em>), then it should be written in a <em>get</em> with a <em>vav</em> (unless we know he spells it without one).)</p>\n<p>As always, consult a qualified rabbi if this is a practical matter for you.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In respect to Nochum/Nachum, Yerachmiel/Yerachm'el, Yerucham/Yerocham, and Tuviah/Toviah, my personal experience has been that people are lazy and would rather botch up the name with a vowel that's easier to pronounce than to say it properly. Try it for yourself: it's much easier to say a /uh/ sound than /ō/ or /ah/ - it requires less effort since you don't have to open your mouth as far. Likewise, my name and all those others out there named Doniel put the vowel under the aleph instead of the yud for a similar reason: it's much easier to drop the consonant sound and say duh-nee-ail instead of duh-nee-yail. </p>\n\n<p>That said, Shamshon/Shimshon should be a counterexample, since, according to all of the versions you've heard, people pronounce the version that requires more effort. (As for my comment of \"versions <em>you've</em> heard,\" I mentioned up in the comments that all of the Shimshon's I know use a chirik. This difference, which I'm sure occurs with other names as well, can probably be chopped up to minhag avoseichem b'yadeichem.) The reason I don't like the answer provided that Shamshon came from Samson is because otherwise the original pronunciation for Doniel would have stayed, since the Anglicized version is pronounced with a /y/ in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to emphasize again that this is all in my experience. I'm not a historian that I can give you a proper citation with empirical evidence to back up this claim. If you're not happy with me, go complain in the Skeptics SE.</p>\n\n<p>The one name left hanging according to my theory is Basyah/Bisyah, but I'm sure that it's because of the Midrash. That's the one name on the list that everyone (that I know) makes a big deal out of, and that's always the answer provided.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>דניאל is different than the other names mentioned, in that it makes a lot of sense to say that it is simply a reading mistake. See <a href=\"http://excerpted.info/jewish/jewish-languages/hebrewpronunciationerrors/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://excerpted.info/jewish/jewish-languages/hebrewpronunciationerrors/</a>. However, since everyone makes this 'mistake', it's possible that that makes their name Doniel.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, even if the cheese was kosher, and there was absolutely no cross-contamination, the oven itself can't be used for kosher food, because it has been used to cook non-kosher meat products, and the heat of the oven transfers the flavor and aroma of the food throughout the entire oven.\"</p>\n\n<p>At that point, if he says, \"That's very interesting, thanks for explaining it to me.

That is, is he Rasha or Am Ha'aretz? </p>\n\n<p>Assume he knows the laws, just does not believe them to be given by G-d.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a really great question.  Although I think your binary choice is too limiting, it's an interesting dichotomy*.</p>\n\n<p>As in all things Jewish, the simple one line answer is that \"It Depends\".</p>\n\n<p>In the modern world, the typical person who does not keep mitzvot because they don't think that they are really Gd's will is an Am Haaretz.  This type of person is normally typified by statements such as, \"Oh the food is kosher, it's just that the Rabbis are trying to gain political points or get more money.\", Or they might say, \"Tradition never said anything about watching TV on Shabbat, and it helps me relax, whoever said you couldn't watch TV was just confused.\"  These are traditional Am Ha'aretz points of view because they are looking at a very limited impact of the laws and society and don't understand the larger points. Such as how it affects the community, or what other halachot are being balanced and applied.</p>\n\n<p>If a person lives in a healthy and stable environment within a Charedi community (or a Religious Kibbutz or any other similarly closed off Jewish community)**, and are not personally exposed to some terrible situations which have become popular in the press recently... And such a person does not feel that the Mitzvot are binding, that such a person is a Rasha.   Such a person is not really rejecting Gd or the Mitzvot, they are rejecting their community, friends and family.  However, instead of figuring out which aspect of their community they are rejecting, they turn around and declare that they are rejecting Gd instead.  It is not a lack of education of the inner workings of Torah that causes them to reject Gd but rather an aspect of evil within themselves.  If a person really questioned if the community they grew up in was Gd's will, then they would explore other options of what Gd's will might be.  The premise for the story of the Kuzari, for example is how a non-wicked person would act. The King in the Kuzari story says that he does not know how to follow Gd's will, so he brings in people from each religion to learn about all paths and then make a decision. If the person rejecting his upbringing also wasn't a Rasha, they would do the same thing, and examine the many other paths of following Gd's will.  The important thing in the case of the Rasha, is that the person grew up surrounded by Jews and Halachic life, had a good family, good friends, and a healthy life.  To a normal person, this would all be evidence that they are in fact leading a good life and following Gd's will.  So to reject all the blessings that Gd has given them, would be acting as a Rasha.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*They could also be an Acher type person, who feels they are doomed and will be punished, but doing the mitzvot doesn't help at all. Or they could just be confused, or growing, or any sort of other things. Rav Kook even argues that such a a person might be acting as a Tzadik if their motives are pure, and eventually they will return to Gd.</p>\n\n<p>** I don't mean to imply that a Charedi community are the only communities that does things correctly, I'm only trying to give an example of a fully encompassing Jewish community where what is written in the books or taught in schools, and what one sees in life are the same thing. A rare thing in the modern world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at here, but here's Rambam, Laws of Teshuva Chapter 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג,יד  [ו] ואלו שאין להן חלק לעולם הבא, אלא נכרתין ואובדין, ונידונין על גודל רשעם וחטאתם, לעולם ולעולמי עולמים:  המינים, והאפיקורוסים, והכופרים בתורה, </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ג,יז  שלושה הן הכופרים בתורה:  האומר שאין התורה מעם ה', אפילו פסוק אחד, אפילו תיבה אחת--אם אמר משה אמרו מפי עצמו, הרי זה כופר בתורה; וכן הכופר בפירושה, והיא תורה שבעל פה, והכחיש מגידיה, כגון צדוק ובייתוס; והאומר שהבורא החליף מצוה זו במצוה אחרת, וכבר בטלה תורה זו, אף על פי שהיא הייתה מעם ה', כגון הנוצריים וההגריים.  כל אחד משלושה אלו כופר בתורה.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>ג,כו  במה דברים אמורים שכל אחד מאלו אין לו חלק לעולם הבא, בשמת בלא תשובה.  אבל אם שב מרשעו, ומת והוא בעל תשובה--הרי זה מבני העולם הבא, שאין לך דבר שעומד בפני התשובה:  אפילו כפר בעיקר כל ימיו, ובאחרונה שב--יש לו חלק לעולם הבא, שנאמר \"שלום שלום לרחוק ולקרוב, אמר ה'--ורפאתיו\" (ישעיהו נז,יט).</p>\n  \n  <p>ג,כז  כל הרשעים והפושעים והמשומדים וכיוצא בהן שחזרו בתשובה, בין בגלוי בין שחזרו במטמונייות--מקבלין אותן, שנאמר \"שובו בנים שובבים\" (ירמיהו ג,יד; ירמיהו ג,כב):  אף על פי שעדיין שובב הוא, שהרי בסתר בלבד חוזר ולא בגלוי--מקבלין אותו בתשובה. </p>\n  \n  <p>The following do not have a share in the World to Come; instead they are cut off and lost, brought to justice for their great wickedness and sins eternally: the <em>mins</em>, the <em>apikoruses</em>, those who deny the Torah ... <em>mins</em> are those who reject the existence of G-d ... <em>apikoruses</em> reject that He is involved with, and communicates with, humanity ...</p>\n  \n  <p>There are three types of \"Torah deniers\": 1.] one who says the Torah is not from G-d, even one verse or word -- if he says Moses made it up, that's a \"Torah denier\"; similarly 2.] one who denies its explanation i.e. the Oral Law and contradicts its bearers, such as the leaders of the Sadducees and Boethusians; and 3.] one who claims that the Creator dropped His Word in favor of a different one, and this Torah is obsolete, though it was originally G-d-given -- such as the Christians and Muslims.

(The Gemara discusses a case where a couple may have in mind that if their ring ceremony was somehow flawed, marital relations would work as a backup.) </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein z\"l felt that if necessary, we could argue that the couple chose to opt out of halachic marriage and thus never intended for it to apply to them. Both rabbis agreed that to dissolve such a marriage, a Jewish divorce (<em>Get</em>) is required; Rabbi Feinstein felt that if a <em>Get</em> was unobtainable (or if after the fact, she went out and married someone else and bore a child from them), we could follow the non-marriage argument. This was a bold statement of Rabbi Feinstein (it even got surprised looks from his less-traditionalist cousin-once-removed, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik), and most rabbis today try not to rely on it.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yissochar Frand describes how Rabbi Y.E.

At some, but not all, of its appearances in <em>chumash</em>, <em>Rashi</em> comments on it.</p>\n<p>Note that <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3AGesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar_%281910_Kautzsch-Cowley_edition%29.djvu/405\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gesenius</a> (FWIW) says that this \"לו\" has no specific meaning itself, but does change the meaning of the sentence slightly: it is there (in his words) \"to give emphasis to the significance of the occurrence in question for a particular subject\", namely for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_%28grammar%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">subject</a> of the verb (or more precisely for the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/referent\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">referent</a> of the subject of the verb).</p>\n<p>My first question is: When <em>Rashi</em> comments on the presence of \"לו\" in <em>chumash</em>, is it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>because he views such a construction as purely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleonasm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pleonastic</a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elocutio\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rhetorical</a>) in general (i.e., bearing no connotation whatsoever, <em>not</em> like Gesenius), and wishes to explain its presence in that location, specifically, as <em>not</em> purely pleonastic but, rather, bearing the meaning he mentions; or</li>\n<li>because he views such a construction as purely pleonastic everywhere, and wishes to explain its presence in that location <em>b'derech d'rash</em>; or</li>\n<li>because he views such a construction, in general, as, <em>l'havdil</em>, Gesenius does (that the word is adding emphasis of the significance of the action to its subject) and merely wishes to explain in greater detail <em>how</em> or <em>why</em>, in that location, that act is particularly significant to its subject; or</li>\n<li>for some other reason?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And my second question, which can only really be answered once the first is (i.e., once we know why <em>Rashi</em> is commenting at all) is: Why does <em>Rashi</em> choose to comment on some of these and not on others? For example, he comments at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8176/showrashi/true#v1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'reshis</em> 12:1</a>, \"לֶךְ <strong>לְךָ</strong> מֵאַרְצְךָ וּמִמּוֹלַדְתְּךָ וּמִבֵּית אָבִיךָ\", but not at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9980/showrashi/true#v9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>D'varim</em> 16:9</a>, \"שִׁבְעָה שָׁבֻעֹת תִּסְפָּר <strong>לָךְ</strong>\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would say in principal that Rashi would comment on it only in specific cases where he thinks that one might have some reasonable doubt about the Pshat on the Pasuk.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why don't brides (always) cover their hair for their weddings?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why don't brides (always) cover their hair for their weddings? I understand that in some ultra-religious groups they do, but there seem to be many groups within Orthodoxy where they do not cover their hair either during the chuppah or during the reception. (A veil is worn, of course, but that hardly seems to be a full covering.) What is the reasoning behind leaving the hair uncovered during the wedding?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 23)\n\n<p>Per the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0BwgoR9DvCEi_NWU5ZTBhN2ItNTQ4Mi00MzE3LWE4ZGMtZDk5NDhlNDkyYWM5&hl=en_US\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Igros Moshe</a> the bride does not have to cover her hair until the morning after the wedding. The reasoning is that so long that she retains a public presumption of virginity, she has no obligation to cover her hair.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The answer is that the Mishna (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ketubot.2.1?lang=he-en\">Ketubbot 2:1</a>) says that a Betula goes to the Chuppah with her hair uncovered. So what is there to talk about?</p>\n\n<p>Well, there's a responsum (#9) of Mahari HaLevi (the Taz's brother) where he rules that even an Arusa needs to cover her hair. This position seems difficult in light of the above Mishna (and indeed see Yechavveh Daat 5:67 that many, many opinions argue on it) but it was quoted by R Akiva Eiger (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x445\">OC 75</a>) and further cited by the Mishna Berura (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x445\">ibid. sk 11</a>), so it has gained a lot of standing (see, eg. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20027&st=&pgnum=371\">Teshuvot veHanhagot 4:294</a> who requires a full hair covering after Kiddushin because of it). However, Mahari HaLevi was aware of that Mishna and if you read his responsum inside, you'll see he thinks that an Arusa needs to cover her hair for the long period of time that existed once upon a time between Eirusin and Nissuin, but at the Chuppah she can uncover much of her hair because that was the custom so it is not a violation of Dat Yehudit which is by definition dependent on custom. Accordingly, even according to Mahari HaLevi (and seemingly, thus, those who rule like him) a bride need only wear a partial (like a קלתה) hair covering (eg. a veil) for the biblical requirement. This is also the position of R Mordechai Willig (<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/754864/Rabbi_Mordechai_I_Willig/Women_in_Halacha_#7:_Hair_Covering_(Cont'd)_&_Kol_Isha\">here</a> minute ~30).</p>\n\n<p>If you reject the opinion that the obligation starts at Eirusin, you need to draw a different line. One way to approach this is claim that only a Beulah (or, possibly, a women who is presumed to be a Beulah) needs to have her hair covered. Although being a Beulah seems like a reasonable place to draw the line (because an Arusa is still pretty much just as married as a Nesuah so it must be something else -- <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0BwgoR9DvCEi_NWU5ZTBhN2ItNTQ4Mi00MzE3LWE4ZGMtZDk5NDhlNDkyYWM5&hl=en_US\">R Moshe Feinstein</a> -- or because until the marriage is consummated she cannot become a Sotah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=24b&format=pdf\">Bavli Sotah 24b</a>) which is the source for hair covering -- <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20024&st=&pgnum=82\">R Yehuda Herzl Henkin</a> -- or because all Beulot need to cover hair even without marriage -- eg. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7593\">Chelkat Mechokeik EH 21:2</a>), this gets tricky, because at Ashkenazi weddings, at least, Yichud happens before the party, at which point she could technically already be a Beulah. While we all know that's highly unlikely, Halacha does have a principle (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=4447\">Rambam Issurei Biah 19:3</a>) that any Nesuah is presumed to be a Beulah even if they never consummated the marriage (\" שכל נשואה בחזקת בעולה היא אף ע\"פ שנמצאת בתולה\"). Furthermore the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14140&st=&pgnum=233\">Ketubbot 2:1</a>, at least as understood by Penei Moshe and Korban haEeida that \"Lo Shkhicha\" there is only referring to Mukkat Eitz) says that a Betulah who is a widow from Nissuin does <strong>not</strong> go to her wedding with her hair uncovered, implying Nissuin alone is sufficient. Indeed Rav Ovadia Yosef (Yechavveh Daat 5:67) rules that a woman must cover her hair immediately after Yichud once she is a Nesuah.</p>\n\n<p>However, R Henkin argues (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20024&st=&pgnum=82\">Benei Vanim 3:23</a>) that even if one rejects the above reasons for the biblical obligation not coming into effect until the marriage is consummated, one would have to agree that there is no biblical obligation in the wedding hall because the biblical obligation is only in publicly accessible place (like the marketplace היוצא לשוק or חצר שהרבים בוקעים בו) not to a private gathering, even if it's big. Furthermore, R Henkin argues that the Rosh (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37959&st=&pgnum=249\">Ketubbot 2:3</a>) implies that the original permission of leaving the hair uncovered lasted the entire first day, not just at the Chuppah itself.</p>\n\n<p>He thus explains, not unlike the Mahari HaLevi, that since we are only dealing with Dat Yehudit, in a location where the custom is to leave the bride's hair uncovered that is acceptable. (Were she to leave the hall, though, she may need to cover up, at least partially.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A veil is worn, of course, but that hardly seems to be a full covering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I learned that due to the large argument about when the bride first must cover her hair, it is sufficient at the wedding to have a partial covering which satisfies the Biblical requirement (dat moshe) but not the rabbinic requirement (dat yehudit). [See the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=72b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Ketubot 72b</a> where a קלתה is described as fulfilling the Biblical requirement but not the rabbinic one.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mordechai - Religious Leader or Political figure?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm looking to gather some more background, context, sources and opinions, regarding Mordechai's religiousness, or lack thereof.   </p>\n\n<p>This was the topic of a recent comment thread on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/13095/459\">Was Darius Jewish?</a>, specifically on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/597/avi\">@avi</a>'s <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13099/459\">answer</a>.<br>\nThough this was not the topic of the question nor the answer, a side comment turned into a long thread on this.<br>\nInstead of hashing it out there, and just between us, I thought it would be a good idea to gather some additional voices.   </p>\n\n<p>So, to the issue:<br>\nMany well-known midrashim pose Mordechai as a tzaddik, a religious leader, and even a member of the Sanhedrin. I'm sure we all learned these at one point or another.<br>\nOn the other hand, reading the Megilla as a \"story\", focusing on the pshat, but taking into account the historical and cultural context, in addition to relevant background added by other books in the Tanach (such as Melachim Bet, Divrei Hayamim, and other Nevi'im) - it would seem that this was not the case. At the least, there is no evidence or basis for the \"religious figure\" theory, but rather the evidence seems (at least to me) to point in the opposite direction.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, taking into account the intended ambiguity, which is one of the most fundamental motifs of the Megilla, and the obvious historical distance, I don't expect to find \"the one true history\"...    </p>\n\n<p>But I am interested in hearing, what is the basis for the \"religious leader\" theory? Is there evidence for this, or is it \"just\" Midrash* ? What was the original source? What is the Midrash based on? (Obviously besides the Midrash itself, and the persuant discussions in e.g. Gmara*... )<br>\nOr, alternatively (and preferably), sources and explanations for the opposite theory?      </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: To emphasize, I am referring to Mordechai's \"back story\". Even according to the \"non-religious\" theory, there is plenty of room to allow for a change of heart as a result of the Purim events. Therefore anything that relates to his situation <em>after</em> the fact (such as @follick's excellent source in Nechemia) would be besides the point. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: I don't intend on <em>ignoring</em> the midrashim, nor do I expect to be completely independant of them. Rather, I'm interested in the <em>basis</em> of those midrashim, as these are usually based on <em>something</em>, be it a reference, alliteration, extraneous wording, \"secret\" story, etc. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(*) I'm not belittling the importance of those Midrashim or the discussions in the Gmara, of course, but it is both <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4037/does-one-have-to-take-a-midrash-aggadah-literally\">important and extremely difficult</a> to discern which stories are intended to be accepted literally, as \"historical fact\", and which not.<br>\nHence this question. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Here are a couple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The very fact that the Megillah introduces him as איש, and takes the trouble to tell us his lineage and background, indicates that he was a person of importance. (It is true that איש can mean simply \"a man,\" but quite often in Tanach, when a person is introduced with this term, it bears the connotation of \"a prominent person\" - one example is Mordechai's ancestor Kish, in I Sam. 9:1.)</p>\n<p>Contrast with Haman, whose background information is limited simply to the three words בן המדתא האגגי.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The man refused to bow to Haman even under pressure, and even though he knew he was thereby putting himself at risk. This is not the action one would expect from a person who, as in your comments to the other thread, is semi-assimilated. Neither would such a person's first reaction to the decree be putting on sackcloth and ashes rather than trying to use his connections at court.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For that matter, consider Esther's request to him, \"Gather all of the Jews in Shushan, and fast for me...\" She was Mordechai's ward, and it is reasonable to assume that this is an idea she learned from him. (Then, too, if he wasn't a known religious leader, why would she expect that anyone would follow his lead in doing so?)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It is also likely, of course, that the Talmudic and Midrashic evaluation of Mordechai is based on extra-textual considerations. Consider how we find them giving us quite a lot of information about the \"Men of the Great Assembly\" contemporary with these events (and mentioning Mordechai as one of its members), though their activities are barely recognizable in Tanach. Then, too, there is the Talmudic consideration that מגלגלין זכות על ידי זכאי, Hashem causes good things to happen through good people, so that from this point of view the salvation of the Jewish people and the establishment of the important holiday of Purim can hardly have been due to an assimilationist.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some other comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The proof that follick brought from Ezra and Nechemiah (assuming, for argument's sake, that indeed it's the same Mordechai) does not represent, as you're thinking, a \"potential change of heart\" after the story of Purim. The verses there are talking about the first wave of Jews who returned in the wake of Cyrus' decree allowing the rebuilding of the Beis Hamikdash, a few years before the opening scene of the Megillah. We see, then, that there was someone named Mordechai in the first rank of Jewish leaders of the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Your argument (in the comments to the linked thread) that the name Mordechai, seemingly of pagan origin, demonstrates that he (or his parents) were assimilated Jews is rather weak. For one thing, the Gemara (Chullin 139b) associates it with the Aramaic expression מירא דכיא, \"pure myrrh.\" I don't know whether the Gemara means this as an actual etymology for the name or simply an assonance, but it does at least indicate that it's not necessarily derived from a pagan source. Second, consider Antigonos of Socho, who unquestionably served as spiritual leader of Jewry (Avos 1:3) - and yet who bore a Greek name, only a couple of decades after Alexander's conquest of the country.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Your other argument, that the people who were exiled with Yechanyah (as Mordechai was) were semi-assimilated, also lacks any proof. Let's take the verses as given (leaving aside the midrashim on them), that they were \"the carpenters and the locksmiths.\" Which makes them the (lower) middle class - far from the elite. Why would you assume that their commitment to Judaism was weaker than anyone else's?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I just want to point out that the Midrashic tradition of Mordechai being even originally a righteous individual is not completely unsupported by the text. Most (some would argue: <strong>all</strong>) midrashic material is inspired by textual subtleties and allusions, no matter how non-explicit.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37460&st=&pgnum=191\">Esther Rabba</a> (6:3)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושמו מרדכי. הרשעים קודמין לשמן. \"נבל שמו\", \" שבע בן בכרי שמו\". אבל הצדיקים שמם קודם להם. \"ושמו מנוח\", \"ושמו קיש\", \"ושמו שאול\", \"ושמו אלקנה\", \"ושמו בועז\", \"ושמו מדרכי\", לפי שדומין לבוראן דכתיב ושמי ה׳ לא נודעתי להם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, this is clearly not <em>proof</em> to support the midrash's position. (In fact, this rule it's using is not always necessarily true.) Neither does this mean that the midrash is to be taken literally, just because it is basing itself on scriptural allusion. But it does mean that it shouldn't be called \"just midrash\" without basis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16514/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nechemia 7:7</a> Which lists Mordechai amongst the leaders of Israel.

However the Gemora there records an argument between Bais Hillel and Bais Shamai how to prepare for Shabbos. Given that we rule according to Bais Hillel, why is Rashi here quoting according to Bais Shamai?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I've heard from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Carmy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Shalom Carmy</a> that the reference to Beitzah is actually a printer's error and Rashi got this from this <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40607&st=&pgnum=156\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechilta D'Rabbi Yishmael</a>, where it remains undisputed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42844&pgnum=118\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Gur Aryeh on the verse</a> says that Beit Hillel says that if you get something and you need it today, you don't have to wait until Shabbat, since you trust in G-d that He will provide for Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi here, the Gur Aryeh continues, is saying that even according to Beit Hillel, if you happen to come across it, but don't need it, wait until Shabbat to use it. That's why Rashi uses the term \"Nizdamen\", which means \"chance upon\" (Translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881/showrashi/true#v8\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and this is its interpretation: Pay attention to always remember the Sabbath day, so that if you chance upon a beautiful thing, you shall prepare it for the Sabbath </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I upvoted Baal Shemot Tovot's answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I've heard from Rabbi Shalom Carmy that the reference to Beitzah is actually a printer's error and Rashi got this from this <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40607&st=&pgnum=156\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechilta D'Rabbi Yishmael</a>, where it remains undisputed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Michoel, in the comments to that post has a strong question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am not sure how this answers the question. At the end of the day there still remains a dispute in the Gemora between Beis Shaima and Beis Hillel, and we should therefore rule like Beis Hillel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This answer thus requires further elaboration. As I explain <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/01/can-rashi-on-chumash-bring-pasuk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">on my blog</a>, though modified a bit here:</p>\n\n<p>I think that one can put forth the following points.</p>\n\n<p>Look at the context. By this, I mean look at the other Rashis in the perek, and see how many of them are from the Mechilta. See this in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39939&st=&pgnum=309\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekorei Rashi</a>, or alternatively, from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad's Tanach</a>. A taste, listing the dibbur hamatchil and then the source, from pasuk 1 and on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>וידבר א-להים: Mechilta</li>\n<li>את כל הדברים האלה: Mechilta</li>\n<li>לאמר: Mechilta</li>\n<li>אשר הוצאתיך מארץ מצרים: Shemot Rabba (though note that the composition of the entire work is 11th or 12 century); Mekorei Rashi also lists Devarim Rabba, which is indeed earlier.</li>\n<li>מבית עבדים: Shemot Rabba; same caveat. Mekorei Rashi gives Mechilta.</li>\n<li>לא יהיה לך: Mechilta</li>\n<li>א-להים אחרים: Mechilta</li>\n<li>על פני: Mechilta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What Rashi is doing in this perek is a running commentary, primarily adapted from the Mechilta. He is <strong>channeling</strong> the Mechilta for us. As such, if Mechilta has a comment of the sort Rashi would bring (uleaggada hameyashevet divrei hamikra), we would expect him to bring it, even if elsewhere, in a gemara somewhere, there is a dispute, and we rule against the position.</p>\n\n<p>Further, this is <strong>not</strong> the only place Rashi brings a midrash halacha which is against the paskened halacha. Some modern meforshei Rashi take note of this, and explain that Rashi will bring forth such a midrash if he feels that it is more along the lines of peshat, since his goal is a peshat-oriented commentary, as adopted / adapted from midrash. So indeed, Rashi can and will cite midrash which will be against decided halacha, on occasion.</p>\n\n\n",

Based on the fact that it references certain uncommon names of God and that the custom's origin seems to be the Sh'la, I would identify this prayer as being of a kabbalistic nature.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don't know if this has basis, but I've always felt that kabbalistic practices should be kept to one's self as private practices. This is why, although I personally do not recite the prayer, I think it is proper that it is not customarily recited out loud, but rather quietly in an undertone.</p>\n\n<p>However, this past week, the <em>chazzan</em> of the minyan I was praying with decided to have everyone sing it out loud in unison to a popular tune. This made me extremely uneasy.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask: Is there anything really wrong with what this <em>chazzan</em> did?

I'm sure we all learned these at one point or another. On the other hand, reading the <em>m'gila</em> as a \"story\", focusing on the <em>p'shat</em>, but taking into account the historical and cultural context (as supplied by Jewish sources) in addition to relevant background added by other books in the <em>Tanach</em>, it would seem that there is no evidence or basis for the \"gentile figure\" theory, but rather the evidence seems (at least to me) to point in the opposite direction. (I'm not keeping these details close till there are some answers. I'll share them! (a) When he heard <em>Haman</em>'s plot, he agreed; but as soon as he heard that the nation in question was the Jews, he relented. Not the mark of a gentile in those days. (b) 10:1 seems irrelevant in a book of <em>Tanach</em> unless it's to communicate the story of a Jewish king. (c) <em>Ester</em>, although she refused any special cosmetics, is not described as having made herself repulsive, as might be expected by a Jewish girl who's being sought by a non-Jewish suitor.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, taking into account the intended ambiguity, which is one of the most fundamental motifs of the <em>m'gila</em>, and the obvious historical distance, I don't expect to find \"the one true history\"....</p>\n\n<p>But I am interested in hearing, what is the basis for the \"gentile leader\" theory? Is there evidence for this, or is it \"just\" <em>midrash</em>* ? What was the original source? (Obviously besides the <em>midrash</em> itself, and the persuant discussions in e.g. <em>g'mara</em>*... ) Or, alternatively (and preferably), sources and explanations for the opposite theory?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(*) I'm not belittling the importance of those <em>midrashim</em> or the discussions in the <em>g'mara</em>, of course, but it is both <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4037\">important and extremely difficult</a> to discern which stories are intended to be accepted literally, as \"historical fact\", and which not.

He ruled over a vast empire besides that, \"from Hodu to Kush,\" but those two countries were the core of it. So the logical inference is that he was either a Persian or a Median.

Doesn't the lintel lie above the door, as in modern doorframes? (If I'm understanding correctly Rashi's description in Pesachim 94b, ד\"ה אי נמי, the door's upper pivot fits into a hole in the lintel - implying that they are stacked vertically.)

He writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14121&st=&pgnum=267&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 15:7</a>) that the \"מו\" form is actually a contraction of the plural (with \"מ\") and singular (with \"ו\") third persons. It is then used when we want to imply that many people or things are separate entities in reality but that there is an element of unity (אחדות) among them. He compares this to using the singular pronoun to refer to a plural subject (as in the famous \"ויחן שם ישראל\") and the קרי וכתיב we often find where a plural noun (like \"ידיו\") is written as if it were singular (\"ידו\").</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is equivalent script for \"them\" and is unique for poetry.\nsource: <a href=\"http://mikranet.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=14442\" rel=\"nofollow\">השירה המקראית</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If you check the trop, the \"הם-\" suffix gets the trop mark and emphasis, but with the \"מו-\" suffix, it's the previous syllable that is emphasized.

    "content": "# If the last day of Passover is Friday, may I eat chametz on the Shabbat right after?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This year, 5778, the last day of Pesach in Israel is on Friday.  Is there any possible way that one could contrive to eat chometz on the shabbos immediately following Pesach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>As long as it's Pesach (i.e. until Friday at dark), a Jew cannot own any kind of chametz.  Once Pesach ends, Shabbos immediately begins.  A Jew cannot use money to (re)purchase chametz, and can't cook/bake any new chametz.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, even in Israel, observant Jews will use matza for their shabbos \"challah\" on the shabbos immeditaely after Pesach (known as the 8th day of Pesach in the Diaspora).</p>\n\n<p>For Ashkenazi Israeli Jews, there is one way to make a clear distinction between the food on the shabbos after Pesach, and Pesach itself.</p>\n\n<p>The custom of refraining from kitnyios on Pesach only applies to eating it.  Ashkenazi Jews may own, do commerce with, and benefit from kitnyios throughout Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>So, buy some Pesach-certified kitnyios food on Chol HaMoed.  Once shabbos starts, break out the rice, corn, beans, have a festive kitnyios meal!</p>\n\n<p>For shabbos lunch, I highly recommend a salami sandwich, on matza, with MUSTARD (another kitnyios item).</p>\n\n<p>Since this question only applies in Israel, I must disagree with msh210's suggestion.  Here in Israel, there is a high probability that the fresh chametz product came into existence with at least some forbidden assistance from a Jew.  Even if it came from an Arab-owned bakery that is certified kosher - that kosher supervision doesn't apply on Pesach!  So, you can't eat it because it wasn't under kosher supervision at the time it was baked, so you have no way of knowing what exactly is in the chametz product.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Eat bread at a non Jew's house.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Per the Yalkut Yosef 448:5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is permitted to eat Chometz on a Shabbos which is immediately after Sheviyi Shel Pesach - there is no Muktza involved, and if it was sold to the non Jew according to Halacha you may eat it on the day of Shabbos immediately after Sheviyi Shel Pesach. However you have to be extra careful not to take the chometz on Sheviyi Shel Pesach since then you will be prohibited to eat it since you have done Baal Yiro'eh U'Baal Yimotzei.

One may buy <em>Pas palter</em> as no kosher bread is available or kosher bread sold to a Gentile and brought back, is of poorer quality as it is old or it has been frozen (Matza is also poor form of bread <em>lechem Oni</em>).** This is the opinion of the Rosh (as explained by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.325.4?lang=he&p2=Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.325.3&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz</a>)    </li>\n<li>But some forbid because they consider the wheat <em>Muktze</em> when Jewish people  benefit regardless of whether it was baked for Gentiles sake. <em>Mukze</em> here means the wheat when Yom Tov commenced was not ready eat as bread without forbidden melacha changes of threshing grinding kneading and baking <em>shelo letzorech</em> (not for the sake of Yomtov).

So if the arab made bread in a bakery en-masse on the 7th day Pesach (in Israel) for Motzei Yomtov on Shabbos (even though there is no <em>Pas Yisroel</em> bread available and kosher ingredients are used), he is mostly making it for the sake of the Jews so this is <em>Amira leakum</em>* and forbidden (even from an existing flame which the Jew lit).

No Rishonim mention it. He says his reasoning is recorded only in a non-extent commentary of his to the Shulchan Arukh, so we can't say anything definitive, but it seems to revolve around the meaning of particular phenological terms recorded in this context. In that light, it's worth noting as well that the Talmud's term for the trees מלבלבי, commonly translated as <em>blossoming</em>, consistently parallels in the Targumim the biblical root פרח, commonly translated as <em>flowering</em>; however, there is much confusion surrounding applying these terms since in rabbinic and likely biblical Hebrew that term meant something more like sprouting or budding (see Zohar Amar's article in <em>Tehumin</em> 38 and cf. Gen 40:10, Num 17:23 with Rashi/Re\"em vs. Rasa\"g, Pro 11:28, Can 7:12, Rambam Sheviit 7:5, Kilayim 6:9, Orlah 1:7, Radak <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39117&st=&pgnum=298\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shorashim פרח</a>; a survey of biblical Israeli trees (grape, fig, pomegranate, olive, date) shows that indeed blossoming, when present, doesn't tend to happen until after Nissan and Chazal elsewhere still depict the onset of spring using those trees (Pirkei DeRebbi Eliezer 51) and greenery in general (RH 11a); plus we all know our <strong>Lulav</strong>im on Sukkot don't have flowers!)</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, a few modern Poskim permit reciting your referenced blessing on non-fruit trees if no fruit trees are available (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52340&st=&pgnum=546\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vaya'an Shemuel 4:3</a>, cf. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1416&st=&pgnum=52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shevet HaLevi 6:53:4</a> and Teshuvot veHahagot 7:27:13).

Because its is not fitting to mention <strong>riding AND separation of the legs</strong> by a woman...\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm no scholar, but notice the difference.

If the 70 elders can \"see\" God, how is it that God is not able to let Moshe \"see\" him later?</p>\n\n<p>Of course God is free to enact whatever rules he chooses, but is there another way to read these two passages?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=49b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yevamos 49b</a> asks a similar contradiction between that verse and the description of Yeshayahu (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1006.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">6:1</a>) in which he states that he saw Hashem. The gemara says that this is no contradiction because Moshe had a clear lens through which he saw Hashem whereas Yeshayahu's was unclear.

In each context, we have to understand what this \"seeing\" is referring to. This is the way I understand the difference:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mishpatim</strong>- Seeing God represents seeing the actions done by God and how he is perfect. Even though the elders comprehended this idea, they still didn't act respectfully. (My personal understanding)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ki Tisa</strong>- Seeing God represents understanding <em>what God is</em>. Moshe asks to comprehend God. God answers that nothing alive can comprehend Him.

The most relevant bits:</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that they saw something like the Ma’aseh HaMerkavah, the chariot that Yechezkel saw. “And above the firmament which was over [the chayos’] heads looked like sapir stone, the image of a throne; and on the image of a throne was an image that looked like a person upon it above it.” (Yechezkel 1:26) And, in fact, Targum Onkelos on our verse inserts the word “yeqar” to say that they saw the “glory of the G-d of Israel”. This parallels Yechezkel’s description of seeing something that “looked like the image of Kevod Hashem, the glory of Hashem”. (Ibid v. 28)</p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Sa’adia Gaon (Emunos VeDei’os 2:10), there is a kavod nivra – kavod as a created thing. The vision at Mount Sinai and that of Yechezkel were not of Hashem, as that is logically impossible. Rather, they saw this kavod. The Rambam’s approach (Moreh Nevuchim 1:64) is similar to Rav Saadia’s, except that he writes that the phrase “Kevod Hashem” is a synonym; it could refer to either Hashem Himself, in all His glory, or it could be used to refer to the kavod nivra. In our case, the text means that they saw the kavod nivra. However, in Moshe’s later request, he was asking to see Hashem Himself, which is why he was unable to have his desire granted.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Sa’adia Gaon writes that the shechinah is indeed part of the physical world, but that it is a kavod nivra. In fact, Rav Sa’adia Gaon holds that the term “shechinah” refers to any miraculous thing that reminds the viewer that Hashem is shochein beqirbo, dwelling with him. Thus, the pillars of fire and of cloud were the shechinah, as were the vision of Mount Sinai and of the Merkavah. Rav Sa’adia Gaon’s notion of kavod nivra can be a physical object. Therefore this vision could occur through regular, physical sight.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the Rambam’s opinion diverges. He holds (Ibid. 2:6) that the kavod nivrah could only be seen prophetically. It is different in kind to the pillars of fire and of smoke, which were physical entities created miraculously.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban disagrees with both. In his commentary on the verse where Hashem promises Yaaqov that He will descend with him to Egypt (Bereishis 46:1), the Ramban says that “Sh-echinah” is a name of Hashem, not a created thing (nor a class of them). However, this does not mean that Mosheh and the elders actually saw Hashem in human form. The Ramban on our verse explains that the vision was prophetic. It would seem that in the Ramban’s view, a prophecy can be a vision of something that cannot truly exist.</p>\n\n<p>This indicates that underlying our debate there must be a basic difference in how the Rambam and the Ramban understand prophecy. Even though the Rambam agrees that the vision was prophetic, he still argues that it could not have been of Hashem, because He has no body.</p>\n\n<p>We find an instance of a similar debate in their understandings of the beginning of Parashas Vayeira. According to the Rambam, any narrative that involves people seeing mal’akhim must be the retelling of a prophecy. Mal'akhim do not have physical substance; they cannot be physically seen. Therefore, the Rambam holds that the parashah opens by telling us that Hashem visited Avraham, and then elaborates by telling us the substance of the visit, the prophecy that Avraham received. In other words, Avraham did not interrupt Hashem’s visit to welcome what he thought were three people. Rather, the visit itself was the vision in which Avraham hosted the three mal’akhim. (Moreh 2:42)</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban takes issue with this understanding. After all, did these mal’akhim not then proceed to Sodom where they saved Lot? Was Lot not really saved? According to the Ramban, the story physically occurred. Avraham saw the mal'akhim in the regular sense, actually fed them food, etc… (Bereishis 18:2)</p>\n\n<p>What does the Rambam do with the Ramban’s question? The Abarbanel, in his commentary on the Moreh Nevuchim, writes that according to the Rambam, things seen in prophecy really occur. They are visions of events happening in higher planes of reality. The prophet’s mind and pen may make sense of the vision by interpreting its contents as things familiar from normal sensory experience, but the event seen is both non-physical and real. This is consistent with the Rambam’s position on our verse in Mishpatim. They saw something real. And since G-d does not have a body in any plane of existence, mot even a metaphysical “body”, their vision had to be of kevod Hashem, something created to be a metaphor for them to see.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban, on the other hand, understands prophecy to be the relaying of a message by the medium of a metaphor. The message relays a truth, but the vision is not of something real, it is a kind of communication. He, therefore, is not bothered by the idea that the metaphor they were given the message in was an anthropomorphic one, that of Hashem sitting on a throne.</p>\n\n<p>In neither case do they actually see G-d -- they either see a created entity that is His Kavod, or they watch a metaphor that relays a message, and in the message, G-d is represented by a man in a throne.</p>\n\n<p>(The parts of the blog post I omitted relate this back to how we see Judaism in general, and the dispute between the Lithuanian schools [yeshiva and mussar] and Chassidus.)</p>\n\n\n",

Here, the issur is batel if it no longer imparts flavor (noten taam). To determine this, one would have to have a \"chef\" (kefeila) taste the food to determine if the flavor is there. Since this is not always practical, and we assume we are not experts at 'tasting', we wait until shishim and then assume the flavor is gone, unless it's a very flavorful food (tavlin) when we usually assume you are just stuck.</p>\n\n<p>(There are way too many sources, but see the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=462\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz YD 98:3</a> for a similar, succinct, and good enough summary)</p>\n\n<p>Some issurim have special rules, as outlined below, as applicable.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To deal with the question fully, I have to look at different kinds of issurim.</p>\n\n<h3>Standard Issur -- No Water</h3>\n\n<p>First let's assume a standard issur that has no water content, eg. Chelev - forbidden fats (I assume these are 100% lipid. Biologists may correct as neccasary, but it's more about the principle of the matter anyway).</p>\n\n<p>Distillation, would pull out all of the water, and leave the taam behind. So, assuming you couldn't taste the fat in your distilled water, it's fine. Presumably the worry about the quality of our taste buds is irrelevant when we can <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14297/kosherizing-water-using-distillation#comment26144_14297\">scientifically say that no taste remains</a>. If you think taste might remain, well, then you've got a problem with your water.</p>\n\n<h3>Standard Issur -- With Water</h3>\n\n<p>Now let's assume we have a standard issur that contains water (eg. Neveila -- forbidden meat). After distillation, we have a mixture of our standard water and the meat-water. So we have min bemino, and we follow the rov while rabinnicaly we require shishim. If you have 60 times as much water as meat, then you are for sure OK. If not, then you would have to evaluate how much water is in the meat, and take 60 against that. This can be hard to do, so we try to avoid doing it and usually just assume it's not kosher.</p>\n\n<h3>Special Issurim</h3>\n\n<p>Some issurim require numbers more than sixty on a rabbinic level (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5215.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">terumah at 100</a>; <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5215.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">orla and kilaei hakerem at 200</a>). These would then fit, as above, but with the numbers adjusted to their respective amounts.</p>\n\n<p>Some issurim are not batel \"even in 1000.\" These include <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5215.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">davar sheyesh lo matirin</a> (something that can be made permissible in a different way) such as chadash or muktza. So in our case, either you say that indeed it is never batel, and if there is any water content in the issur then all the water is prohibited, or you draw a distinction similar to those given regarding chametz in tap water (see: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/6630/759\">tap water on Pesach</a>).</p>\n\n<h3>Rainwater</h3>\n\n<p>The questioner refered specifically to a comment about rainwater. Since the majority of the water in the world is permitted, we can say \"kol deparish, meiruba parish\" (whatever comes out of a mixture, came from the majority) and thankfully permit all rainwater for consumption without worry of its previous culinary uses.</p>\n\n<h2>CYLOR!</h2>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Basically yes, though milk&meat may be the exception.</p>\n\n<p>I heard Rabbi Hershel Schachter call this a question of <em>efshar lehasiro</em>, quoting Rabbi Soloveichik. IIRC the Gemara discusses roasting some meat where the fat and blood drip to the bottom; then if you know just the right amound of salt to add, you can pull out one and leave the other. (Something to that effect, I'm hazy, sorry.)</p>\n\n<p>While we discuss the question of <em>efshar lesochato</em> (and generally conclude that's no good), that means: take a potato, cook it in ham juice; then put the potato in a giant vat of water and cook it there for several hours. Can you ever diffuse enough out of the potato that we can now kasher the potato? Generally not.</p>\n\n<p>But if we can perfectly chemically separate the two, that's a different story.</p>\n\n<p>Milk & meat is a weird one because you took two kosher ingredients and now the mix is 100% non-kosher; IIRC Rabbi Schachter quoted Rabbi Soloveichik that in theory even there, perfect chemical extraction would suffice.</p>\n\n\n",

Each verse refers to a different person (except the last, which refers to a nation) and makes various allusions to that person's interactions with water found in the Torah and Midrash, with the prominent repetition of the word \"mayim\" (\"water\") throughout and ending each verse.</p>\n\n<p>The subjects of the six verses are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avraham</li>\n<li>Yitzchak</li>\n<li>Ya'akov</li>\n<li>Moshe</li>\n<li>Aharon</li>\n<li>The 12 Tribes of Israel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there's anyone in the Torah+Midrash who's associated with water, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112396/jewish/Miriam.htm\">Miriam</a> is, as the well on which the Israelites depended for their water in the desert was called \"the Water of Miriam\" in the Midrash. One of her other claims to fame was \"Song of Miriam,\" the version of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_sea\">Song of the Sea</a> that she led the women to sing on the banks of the Red Sea. She's also known for the vigil she stood over her baby brother Moshe, when he was hidden in the Nile.</p>\n\n<p>Why isn't there a verse of Tefilat Geshem devoted to Miriam? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It's important to notice that there IS a verse for Miriam in the Hoshanos that we all said (or mumbled) just a day before Tefillas Geshem, and we must remember that Tefillas Geshem and Hoshanos were written by the same author, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_ben_Killir\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Elazar Hakalir</a>. So clearly R' Elazar Hakalir valued Miriam's role as it relates to water and mentioned it in our <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Sefard%2C_Sukkot%2C_Hoshana_Rabba.32?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">prayers for water</a>, which is the main purpose of the piyutim of Hoshanah Rabbah.</p>\n<p>This is the verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְמַעַן נְבִיאָה מְחוֹלַת מַחֲנַיִם. לִכְמֵהֵי לֵב הוּשְׂמָה עֵינַיִם. לְרַגְלָהּ רָצָה עֲלוֹת וָרֶדֶת בְּאֵר מַיִם. לְטוֹבוּ אוֹהָלָיו. הוֹשַׁע נָא וְהוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא אָבִינוּ אָתָּה</p>\n<p>In the merit of the prophetess [Miriam] of the dance of the camps, to those of thirsting heart she was an inspiration, at her feet ran, rising and descending, the well of water -- for the sake of the one of goodly tents, may You save now and being salvation now, for You are our Father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>Translation from <em>The Artscroll Siddur</em></sup></p>\n<p>So why not include her in the main pizmom of Tefillas Geshem?  Perhaps some of the answers above are correct. I think there is another issue here. Tefillas Geshem (unlike Hoshanos) was written specifically for the \"Avos\" section of Shemoneh Esrei. It is beyond the scope of this question why the traditional tefillah mentions only the Avos and not the Imahos, but I think R' Elazar Hakalir was simply fitting into that framework, which is what he does in many of his piyutim that are written for the first brachos. Extending it to Moshe and Aharon is not as revolutionary since they are often seen as part of our group of leaders (think Ushpizin for example).</p>\n<p>There is one notable exception that I noticed (and keep in mind that he wrote piyutim for the \"Avos\" section for all Shalosh Regalim and Arbah Parshios) and it is not Shemini Atzeres but rather Rosh Hashanah!</p>\n<p>R' Elazar Hakalir felt that Rosh Hashanah was THE day of the Imahos, and chose to focus on them on this day (and given that it is the birthday of man, I think the focus on the Imahos on this day brings them up to a special place in his mind). On Rosh Hashanah, of course, the leyning and haftarah focus on the Imahos and so do the piyutim in first brachos (the ones that unfortunately many Shuls decide to skip these days but that are printed as not optional in the main text of all machzorim).</p>\n<p>Specifically, R' Elazar Hakalir's piyutim in Shachris of the first day (he didn't write the ones for second day), focus on Sarah in first brachah (generally dedicated to Avraham), Rivkah in second and Rachel in third.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>While this last part is slightly off topic, we see 2 things in my response:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>R' Elazar Hakalir valued Miriam's role in our prayers for rain (as seen in Hoshanos).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>R' Elazar Hakalir greatly valued the role of women, specifically the Imahos, and chose to make them, rather than the Avos the focus of his piyutim (within the bracha of Avos!) on the day on which man was created and on which we crown our King.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would guess that unlike on Rosh Hoshanah, he didn't have a strong reason to bring in a woman to the \"Avos\" section on Shemini Atzeres where people generally expect to connect their tefillos specifically to to the Avos (defined loosely to include Moshe/Aharon here).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1. The Hebrew text can be found on Sefaria starting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Machzor_Rosh_Hashanah_Ashkenaz_Linear%2C_The_Morning_Prayers%2C_First_Day_of_Rosh_Hashana%2C_Reader%27s_Repetition.67&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Select passages from the translation in <em>The Complete Artscroll Machzor</em> are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...<br />\nOn this day the strength of [Sarah] his allotted portion became rejuvenated, to blossom with an heir at ninety years. She symbolized that the nation called 'a rose' would pass before Him on this Rosh Hashannah. ... They rely on [Sarah's] merit to be remembered, crying out as a congregation knocking on the doors.<br />\n...<br />\nThey approach to express the nine blessings [of Mussaf], ... equal to the nine sacred names in [Hannah's] prayer, the barren one who supplicated and gave birth to seven. ... At this season, [Isaac] supplicated with prayer for the sake of the barren [Rebeccah] until she was released.<br />\n...<br />\nThe lofty mainstay [Rachel] was disdained by the [nation's] builders. She was one of the four as childless as stones, [who were remembered] this day. She wept tears for her children, and heard [God say] 'Cease, O mother of the children.' ... At first the mainstay of the house was estranged, but like the first fruits she finally had her firstborn. Her merit endures for her offspring on this day of remembrance, that they be remembered as she was remembered.</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think the paytan was working the other way. He had a list of holy 'shepherds' in who's zchus we beseach water, he filled in the stanzas with something about water concerning them all. This is very apparent from some of the forced associations. The one about Avraham is all poetic and nothing literal. Mentioning Moshe being thrown in the water seems strange. Mentioning his hitting of the rock is almost counterproductive! But looking at it the way I am mentioning, it all seems a little easier to swallow. As such Miriam who is never on our list of heros doesn't get mentioned, even if she is our greatest water heroine. I'm also guessing the shvatim are mentioned in place of Yosef Hatzadik.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps Miriam is alluded to in the verse יִחַד לֵב וְגָל אֶבֶן מִפִּי בְאֵ<strong>ר מַיִם</strong> </p>\n\n<p>and also in the verse קוֹרֵא וּמַזֶּה טָהֳרַת  *<em>מַיִם ר</em>*וּחַק מֵעַם פַּחַז כַּמָּיִם</p>\n\n<p>Another thought: When Miriam was Nifteres it says that the water continued in the Zechus of Moshe who was still living. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112396/jewish/Miriam.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112396/jewish/Miriam.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

That is less than half of the commandments of the Torah.

With exile having been our dominant mode of existence for most of our history, there is a real danger that we'll come to see that as the norm.

(We even find that the paradigmatic forgotten halachos, those that were lost during the period of mourning for Moshe, include cases involving kodashim - Temurah 15b-16b.) At least with tefillin and tzitzis and mezuzah, since they are daily activities, their basic halachos are pretty clear and unequivocal; the machlokos about them tend to involve the details. (Everyone agrees, for example, about the shape, color, and positions on the body of tefillin, and on what parshiyos are in them.) By contrast, if the details of korbanos, tzaraas, and similar mitzvos weren't given in the Written Torah, it is quite possible that substantial chunks of this information would have been lost or confused (the more so because there are a lot of subtle differences between ostensibly similar cases).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps on a pseudo-philosophical level:</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can get a reward for a mitzva that I didn't do myself is if I connect myself to the broader body of the Jewish people.

    "content": "# What are Jewish conventions regarding honeymoons?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are Jewish conventions regarding honeymoons? Is a honeymoon taken, and, if so, is it done immediately after the wedding--or later, once the woman is again tehora?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is no sanctioned \"vacation\" in Judaism or Jewish weddings.  The whole concept appears to be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"new invention\"</a> even in Christian Society.</p>\n\n<p>However, \"honeymoon\" periods do exist.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, there is the week of sheva brachot, where all meals are supposed to be joyous and glad with many members from the community. There is also a custom to invite people who could not make it to the wedding.</p>\n\n<p>After the week of Sheva Brachot, there is also a concept known as \"Shana Rishona\" Or \"The first year\".  During the first year of marriage, the couple, if possible should never spend a night apart. They should not invite guests for Shabbat, and A soldier should not go to war.  Over the generations, other customs have grown out of \"Shanna Rishona\"</p>\n\n<p>As for the aspect of being Tahor I have seen various customs on the issue, some of which arguably go against halacha.</p>\n\n<p>One custom I have heard of is that after the first night of marriage, the couple does not consummate the marriage, so that they may touch each other during the week of Sheva brachot, and only once the stress has been reduced, and family is gone, and \"life is normal\" do they sleep together.  As far as I am aware, this is a common custom, yet not approved by anybody.</p>\n\n<p>Another custom is to have a 'honeymoon' on the evening of the wedding, where the bride and grooom will spend the evening in a fancy hotel, and they will spend the first day together before getting involved with the family and friends for the sheva brachot.</p>\n\n<p>Another custom I have seen, is to take a \"honeymoon\" months after the wedding, waiting for a good time in the calendar where they can have a long weekend together and go away.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The modern custom of honeymoons raises a significant halachic question, famously <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1525&st=&pgnum=328\" rel=\"nofollow\">addressed by R. Yitzchak Abadi in his sefer Ohr Yitzchak</a> which is the problem of \"dam besulim\". After the first time a couple is intimate on the wedding night, they are normally required to avoid relations until the wife becomes pure again, as you allude to in your question. But on honeymoons, which most couples take immediately after the wedding, couples are generally assumed to have relations again, within the prohibited timeframe. R. Abadi attempts to find a way around this problem in order to make sure that the majority of couples that go on honeymoons are not transgressing. His approach is rejected by R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, whose response is published in R. Abadi's sefer along with R. Abadi's rebuttal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Saw three opinions re: taking a honeymoon <strong>immediately after a wedding</strong> cited in <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_sheva_berachot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this OU article</a> about Sheva Berachot:  </p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Even though making daily sheva berachot is not obligatory, halachah does not endorse the secular custom of a honeymoon either. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef (Yabia Omer 3:EH:11:11) strenuously objects to such a practice and views it as indicative that the couple “is not interested in the berachot.”[15] </p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the topic of the honeymoon, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (Made in Heaven: A Jewish Wedding Guide [New York, 1983]) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is not the Jewish practice for the bride and groom to “escape” on a honeymoon right after the wedding. Rather, they remain in their home community. They are beginning their married life, not separated from the community but as an integral part of it (p. 230).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Rabbi Shlomo Aviner</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Aviner (\"Rayim Ahuvim\" pp. 167-169) is in the minority when he says he sees no problem with a honeymoon and that couples should do as they please.</p>\n\n<h3>AGAIN, IMPORTANT TO NOTE:</h3>\n\n<p>Even those cited above who are opposed to honeymoons (R' Ovadia, R' Aryeh Kaplan), they seem to be <strong>only</strong> referring to <strong>a honeymoon IMMEDIATELY after the wedding</strong>.   </p>\n\n<p>A honeymoon taken a few weeks/ months after the wedding would seem to be fine to everyone as it's nothing more than a nice trip for the husband and wife!</p>\n\n\n",

In the old days, one might find a tree, cut it down, throw it across the chasm, and hope and pray that the tree is big enough and strong enough to get the people across.  As people learned more about bridges and gravity, people started to learn formulas that would predict if a bridge would be strong enough or not.  Sometimes, people would make mistakes, and a very large bridge would be built, and then fall to the ground when a wind came.  Today, we have many many details about how to build a bridge, and our bridges last longer than they did in the past and they are larger.  However they are also harder to build, and the slightest error will get the project canceled.</p>\n\n<p>GD created the world, and He created the rules that allow bridges to be built, in which there can be no deviation.  Rav Solevetchik called this the halachot of Din, and strict justice.  This is how Gd decided to build his world, where the smallest detail can cause a large bridge to come tumbling down.</p>\n\n<p>So too, Gd gave us laws and halachot in Rachamim, and Mercy.  These are laws that can be followed or not followed based on a person's free will.  These are the halachot of the Jewish religion, all the laws and minor details, from which the world is built.</p>\n\n<p>Many other people wish to worship Gd in the way that the old bridge builders would worship Gd. They throw some general idea out to the world, and hope and pray that it will lead them on a good path and towards a good life.  However they get consumed by this one idea, or 10 or 13, or 5, however many a person can hold in their mind at once, and when a Strong wind comes, their \"bridge\" gets knocked down, and bad things grow and fester in society.  This problem can happen to Jewish people as well, when we try to take the \"easy route\" or don't pay attention to all the details of how each law affects the other. When we forget that every stringency is a leniency in another issue.</p>\n\n<p>This is why we have so many laws and mitzvot with so many details, so that we can build proper Bridges to Gd.</p>\n\n<p>As for anti-semitism..

    "content": "# Can the living negatively affect the dead?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I know, living people can <em>positively</em> affect the dead. This is the reason we say Kaddish and learn Mishnayos for the souls of the deceased. (Feel free to comment with more examples of this.) If you want to get more mystical, there are numerous stories of tzaddikim finding tikkunim for sinful souls.</p>\n\n<p>So today I read an article that mentioned how the <a href=\"http://slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/mormon_explainer_1/2012/02/mormons_baptize_wiesenthals_is_there_a_way_to_stop_baptism_by_proxy_.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mormon Church posthumously baptized Simon Wiesenthal's parents</a>, and I wondered: is it possible to <em>negatively</em> affect the souls of the deceased?   </p>\n\n<p>(Mormon posthumous baptism just provided the impetus for this question. I'm interested in the more general idea of souls being negatively affected <em>after</em> death.)</p>\n\n<p>@DoubleAA brought up an interesting point in the comments that I didn't think of. Is a soul affected when a living person sins because of something the deceased did while alive?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specifically, I'm wondering if there are sources that discuss this, rather than looking for personal logic and intuition.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Summary: One who drinks water on the eve of Shabbat or, according to other opinions, following mincha on Shabbat, steals water from the souls in Gehenom and thus harms them. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is little, if any, Scriptural discussion regarding the continued life of a soul following death, therefore we are left exploring the murky depths of Midrash. I refer you to the (odd?) halachic dispute regarding drinking water on the eve of Shabbat and following mincha on Shabbat. A good discussion of the argument can be found in the book 'Kaddish' by Leon Wieseltier. Here are some excerpts [page 100-105 of first Vintage Books edition, 2000]:</p>\n\n<p>The ערוגת הבושם:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.... on the Sabbath the dead are relieved of the judgment of hell. On\n  that afternoon the souls are made to stand by a gleaming fountain of\n  water that flows at the entrance to the garden, and then rinse\n  themselves in the water to cool their bodies from the fire... Since\n  the souls at that hour are standing by that fountain, the geonim and\n  the [post-Talmudic] rabbis established the custom that we do not drink\n  water between the afternoon service and the evening service on the\n  Sabbath, because we would be stealing it from the dead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The שיבולי הלקט<a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%98\"> [about]</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to a rabbinical legend, when an individual drinks water at\n  twilight [on the afternoon of the Sabbath], it is as if he were\n  stealing the water from his dead. And I have found this in the\n  responsa of the geonim: 'We have heard it said in the name of the\n  early sages that for the duration of twilight, permission is granted\n  to the souls of the dead to drink water. And when one drinks water at\n  the hour when the souls of the dead are drinking water, the souls of\n  the dead who are one's kin are not permitted to drink. For this\n  reason, the sages said that it is as if one were stealing from one's\n  own relatives.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The אור זרוע from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Moses_of_Vienna\">Isaac of Vienna</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the afternoon [of the Sabbath] comes... it is the practice of the\n  righteous.... and then to eat a meal. Our Master Tam [רבנו תם] scolded\n  them and said that it was forbidden, citing the tale in the Jerusalem\n  Talmud about a man who drank water between the afternoon prayer and\n  the evening prayer, and the angel of death came and slew him, because\n  he drank when the dead were drinking and so was a robber of the dead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The מרדכי from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_ben_Hillel\">Mordecai ben Hillel</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... Rabbi Meshullam responded that in his text of the ancient\n  rabbinical legend he had a different formulation. His text said that\n  'those who eat and drink on the afternoon of the eve of the Sabbath\n  [steal from the dead] and the reason is that [by Friday afternoon] the\n  dead are exhausted from the judgment they have endured all week. And\n  for this reason he was strict about not drinking on the afternoon of\n  the eve of the Sabbath.... And it is the custom of the whole world to\n  be careful [about drinking the water of the dead]...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Bach concludes that one should not drink either Friday afternoon or Saturday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, the practice of refraining from drinking during these times has all but disappeared, though as can be seen above, was widely practiced in Ashkenazic lands in the Middle Ages.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah says (in the 10 commandments) that God punishes the guilty for 3 or 4 generations.</p>\n\n<p>In many places, I have seen people troubled by this idea, and the general kiruv answer is that if person's children do not do mitzvot, because of the sins of the parent the parent is punished for those lack of mitzvot and sins being done, up to 3 or 4 generations. </p>\n\n<p>It would seem from this answer and common question, that yes, a person can negatively affect the dead.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>HaRav Musafi writes in his Sefer (Shivat Sion) that when someone says Hashkava for someone after the first year of their death it can Has WeShalom have a negative effect and may Has Weshalom lead to the Neshama to get tortured. He also says that when someone reads the Haftara \"Lezecher Nishmat\" someone and makes mistakes it can also negatively effect the Neshama Has Weshalom.</p>\n\n\n",

Note that this category includes shehechiyanu on new clothes. He rules in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=274\">223:4</a> that the obligation starts at the time of the kinyan not the time of wearing, so despite our custom to delay the blessing to later, the obligation fundamentally set in earlier <em>after</em> the kinyan.</p></li>\n<li><p>On new fruit: The shulchan aruch rules in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=277\">225:3</a> that one makes a shehechiyanu upon <strong>seeing</strong> a new fruit, even in someone's hand or on the tree. So despite our minhag (which he notes) to delay the bracha until eating, the obligation sets in <em>after</em> seeing the fruit.</p></li>\n<li><p>On holidays: The shehechiyanu on holidays is usually recited towards the beginning of the holiday on kiddush but the gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=40b&format=pdf\">Eruvin 40b</a> makes it clear that the bracha can be recited at any point even standing alone in the market. Clearly this bracha is on the day, not the \"entering\" of the day and can be recited at any point <em>after</em> the day starts.</p></li>\n<li><p>On mitzvot: So this is the tricky one. We have many mitzvot listed explicitly in the gemara as having shehechiyanu <em>before</em> doing the mitzva, but after the birkat hamitzva (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=21b&format=pdf\">megillah</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=23&format=pdf\">ner chanuka</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=121b&format=pdf\">pidyon haben</a> and more). I'd like to suggest that the bracha here is not on having done a rare mitzva, but upon having the opportunity to do it. As such, the perfect time for the bracha is just before doing the mitzva which is when you are most completely in position to do it. (This may also explain why it is after the birkat hamitzva the saying of which has finally allowed you to perform the mitzva.) Again, my understanding on this one, but I think it works pretty well.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: I found <a href=\"http://www.chaburas.org/shehek1.html\">this article</a> which you might find useful.</p>\n\n\n",

(It's explicit in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%91_%D7%94\"><em>chumash</em></a> (<em>pesach MItzrayim</em>) and <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%97_%D7%90_%D7%90\"><em>halacha</em></a> (<em>pesach doros</em>).)</p>\n\n<p>Do we have some tradition (or historical evidence) that it was usually a sheep? If not, how did it happen that people associate the <em>korban</em> with a sheep?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1]</sup> I have no empirical evidence to offer as far as asking people: it's just my impression. But <em>all</em> I can find using Google (that discusses the <em>pesach</em> as a goat without mentioning that it can be a sheep) is discussing individual cases in which someone brought a goat (including, of course, the case in <em>parashas Tol'dos</em>), plus <a href=\"http://emunatidbits.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/did-you-check-your-goat/\">one blog post</a>. On the other hand, there is much mention of the <em>pesach</em> as a sheep without mentioning that it can be a goat; see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes61-yg.htm\">a <code>vbm-torah.org</code> article</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/yomtov/pesach/5756/vol2no01.html\">a <code>torah.org</code> article</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.tosfosinenglish.com/PDF/Psochim/3b6meyalyoh.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosfos \"me'alyah\", Pesachim 3b</a>, where it says most were sheep. </p>\n\n<p>Background: A non-Jew came and told R' Yehuda ben Beseirah that he routinely goes to Jerusalem to eat from the Korban Pesach (which is forbidden to non-Jews). R' Yehuda wasn't going to Jerusalem himself, and so couldn't notify the Jews there. So he came up with a plan for the non-Jew to get <em>himself</em> caught. R' Yehuda told him that next time, if he really wants to \"stick it to 'em\", he should ask for the best part: the tail-fat. When the non-Jew did so, they busted him, since the tail-fat of a lamb is burnt on the altar and is forbidden to be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos explains that even though the tail-fat of a kid-goat isn't burned (and so the non-Jew might have gotten away with it, if the sacrifice he was part of would have been a kid-goat), R' Yehuda knew he would get caught, since the lamb is the more common sacrifice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Many references to the korban pesach do refer to it as a goat, not a sheep. For instance, the mishna in Beitza (chapter 2, mishna 7) refers to a גדי מקולס (roast kid) that shouldn't be made on pesach since it would be too similar to the korban.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the goat in the song <em>chad gadya</em> presumably is referring to the goat in the korban, besides more symbolic allusions.</p>\n\n\n",

The first prayer books appear from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddur_R._Amram\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amram Gaon</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natronai_ben_Hilai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natronai ben Hilai Gaon</a> in the mid-800's CE. The founding texts of our central prayers today are first mentioned in the Talmud. For instance, the central prayer of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah#Origin\" rel=\"nofollow\">שמונה עשרה</a> is traditionally attributed to Rabban Gamliel, circa first century CE. As noted in the above Wikipedia link, according to one opinion in the Talmud, the Amidah and some other prayers such as Kiddush and Havdalah may be attributed to Members of the Great Assembly, אנשי כנסת הגדולה, an institution existing from ~150 BCE - 70 CE.</p>\n\n<p>In any event, prayer in a formal sense certainly did not exist before the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Tribes#Historical_background\" rel=\"nofollow\">dispersion of the Ten Tribes</a> around 720 BCE. The few prayers that we know to exist, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fruits#In_ancient_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bikkurim prayer</a> for first fruits, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shma\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shma prayer</a>, etc. are all recorded in the Torah and therefore the text is Biblically mandated and cannot be altered.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that that this kabbalistic thought is expressing the idea that each individual and each group has a unique perspective to lend to prayer, and their prayers should thereby reflect one's unique contribution, both in terms of kavanot, one's private intent during prayer, and even in terms of reciting additional prayers of one's own composing, such as insertions at שמע קולנו or as exemplified by the likes of Rabbi Natan of Breslov's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_of_Breslov#Publications%3a_His_own_works\" rel=\"nofollow\">Likutei Tefilot</a>. This seems to be implied by the first appearance of this idea of individual prayers of tribes which is found in the writings of the Holy Ari:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש שינויים רבים בין סידורי התפילות, בין מנהג ספרד ובין מנהג קאטלוניא\n  ובין מנהג אשכנז וכיוצא בזה; הנה בעניין הזה אמר לי מורי [=האר\"י] ז\"ל\n  שיש ברקיע י\"ב חלונות כנגד י\"ב שבטים, וכל שבט ושבט עולה תפילתו דרך שער\n  א' מיוחד לו; והוא סוד י\"ב שערים הנזכר בסוף יחזקאל. והנה אין ספק, כי אם\n  תפילות כל השבטים היו שוות, לא היה צורך לי\"ב חלונות ושערים, וכל שער יש\n  לו דרך בפני עצמו; אלא ודאי מוכרח הוא, שכיוון שתפילותיהם משונות, לכן\n  צריכים שערים מיוחדים לכל שבט ושבט. כי כפי שורש ומקור נשמות השבט ההוא,\n  כך צריך להיות סדר תפילתו. ולכן ראוי לכל אחד ואחד להחזיק כמנהג סדר\n  תפילתו כמנהג אבותיו, לפי שאין אתנו יודע מי הוא משבט זה ומי הוא משבט\n  זה, וכיוון שאבותיו החזיקו במנהג ההוא, אולי הוא מן השבט ההוא, הראוי לו\n  אותו המנהג, ועתה בא לבטלו, ואין תפילתו עולה למעלה, אם לא בדרך הסדר\n  ההוא\" (שער הכוונות, דף נ, ד, מ\"א סח, א, מ\"ב סח, ד)‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The key point by the Ari is:\n<<... It is clear that if the prayers of all the tribes were equal, there would be no need for 12 windows and gates, with each gate having its own separate path; rather it's proven that since the prayers are different for each, therefore, there needs to be individual gates for each tribe. Because according to the root and source of the souls of the tribes, accordingly their prayers are arranged. Therefore it is appropriate for each one to be consistent about his tradition's arrangement of prayers similar that of his father's tradition....>></p>\n\n\n",

(This is called \"a shoteh for one thing.\") It's possible for someone to, G-d forbid, have an eating disorder such that there is really no way they could say, eat a piece of matza on Pesach; at which point they're not obligated. (Though hopefully the person can be rehabilitated.)</p>\n<p>While Rambam says in his Laws of Testimony that \"a person who acts crazy with regards to one matter but is normal in all others\" is considered a Shoteh, it appears the majority opinion since the 1700s has been that this was limited to the definition vis-a-vis qualification to serve as a witness on ritual matters. With regards to mitzva obligations and halachic competence, each action is its own question.</p>\n<p>The classic, \"full-spectrum shoteh\" described by the Talmud is exempt from all mitzvahs. Such a person <em>repeatedly does actions, without reasonable explanation, that indicate he is totally not conscious of reality around him, these are actions no normal person would do</em>. Gemara talks about someone who tears their clothes (but is not an absent-mind professor), goes out at night when it's incredibly dangerous to do so (implying he doesn't realize it's night time or it's dangerous; if he explains that he has a fever and needs to cool off, or even that he's having a panic attack and needs to get out, that mitigates), and/or sleeps in a graveyard (yuck!

Unless he explains he knows exactly what's going on but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_%28ritual%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this is a religious ritual of his</a>.) Rambam gives additional examples such as someone who goes around naked or throws stones -- again, because he's not conscious of reality, or not in control.

If someone is sane when the moon waxes and Shoteh when it wanes, he's fully halachically normal when the moon waxes (called \"itim chalim itim shoteh\"), so too if it depends on whether he's taking his pills.</p>\n<p>Low functional IQ: definitely not a classic Shoteh. Obligation in any given mitzvah would depend on their mental capacity for it, but usually applies.</p>\n<p>Clinically depressed: the Aruch HaShulchan described this case.

Logically this lacks signs of Shoteh, and is just a disease of sadness. It depends on the actions and motivations as seen and understood by the Beis Din (rabbinic court) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Chagigah.3b.14.1?lang=bi&p2=Chagigah.3b.14&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Hagiga 3</a> אני שמעתי חולי האוחז מתוך דאגה).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OCD: most likely there will be some mitzvahs they can't handle right now, and others they can.</p>\n<p>Bipolar/hypomanic: in Camden about 60 years ago, a man would go into fits when he thought he was super-rich and would spend like crazy. The local posek (don't recall his name) said that such behavior doesn't rise to the level described by the Gemara (plenty of people overspend), so he wasn't a full Shoteh. Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin concurred.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I personally know of a case where a man was convinced he is Moshiach, and his wife wanted a divorce and most Rabbis said that he is a Shoteh and can not give a divorce. However after HaRav Moshe Feinstein Zatzal met him he said that he is not a Shoteh and may give a divorce, and gave a letter to the lady that he determined that her previous husband was not a Shoteh. </p>\n\n\n",

He concludes that we rule leniently with regard to a doubtfully necessary blessing, which I take to mean one would not make the blessing.

    "title": "Why is milk with meat not kosher?",
    "content": "# Why is milk with meat not kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've recently read (again) the verse \"לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו\", meaning, \"Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk\".</p>\n\n<p>How did anyone get from that, to \"Don't eat meat with milk at all\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7242/21\">See here for more</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, if you look carefully in Biblical Hebrew, <em>g'di</em> actually means \"a young animal\" -- usually if you didn't specify it meant a goat, but it could be a generic term for any young. Thus elsewhere it might specify <em>g'di izim</em> -- \"a young goat.\"</p>\n\n<p>So that gives us \"don't cook a young animal in its mother's milk.\"</p>\n\n<p>Why the thing about \"mother's\"? Hebrew lesson once again, the language is written without vowels. \"Chalav\" is milk; \"chelev\" is fat. So by adding in the phrase \"mother's\" we know it's talking about cooking it in <em>milk</em>, not <em>fat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that an Oral Tradition was given along with the Bible as we know it, which meant that this verse was intended as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't cook the meat of any ruminant animal in the milk of any ruminant animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The verse appears thrice in the Torah, giving us: don't cook it, don't eat it if it was cooked, and don't sell it if it was cooked.</p>\n\n<p>In fact you'd only violate the direct Torah prohibition if it was cooked with milk; if you took a cold hamburger and soaked it in milk for an hour, that isn't in the prohibition. Centuries later, the rabbis of the Talmud added a prohibition of their own, knowing that if you okayed people to eat such a hamburger, it's likely they'll reheat it - thus getting to a Torah prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>That pertains as the legal definition. As for the ethical message, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch suggests that meat is taking, and milk is giving. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook suggests going back to the simple reading of the verse -- once you kill an animal, its mother's milk has no use. To then take that milk and use it to make the meat extra-tasty is too blatant of a disrespect for animal life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Torah never says anything unnecessarily, yet it repeats the law about not eating a young animal in the milk of its mother three times when it could have said just one \"Don't eat meat with milk\".  From here the gemara and later commentators pick up a few things:\n1) There are three aspects - not cooking, eating or benefiting\n2) The d'oraysa aspect only applies to kosher, domesticated mammals\n3) Milk is kosher even though it was mixed with meat in the mother's udders.\nAll these are learned (see gemara in Chullin as referenced above and elsewhere) from the wording of the three repetitive verses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The commandment</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Do not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>was mentioned three times in Torah, so that indicates it's pretty important.</p>\n<p>According to Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok, this forbidden mixture could be a source of extreme spiritual danger.</p>\n<p>Meat is the product of the animal and milk is the byproduct of the animal, so milk made inside the cow ought to be drunk by its young.</p>\n<p>The meat and milk are prohibited by the Torah only when they're cooked together, because heat is energy and the cooking process does the transference of their essential energetic elements creating the psychically dangerous mixture.</p>\n<p>When flesh is dead and is a meat then it can no longer absorb milk as a life giving food, therefore life giving energy within the milk inverts when it comes into contact with meat and its energy polarity implodes, creating spiritual imbalance.</p>\n<p>Therefore it's prohibited to make and to eat also as one may not derive any semblance of benefit from it.</p>\n<p>And these rules apply to everyone who seeks holiness.</p>\n<p><sup>Source: <a href=\"http://www.koshertorah.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kosher Torah</a> teachings: <a href=\"http://www.koshertorah.com/PDF/energykashrut.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Energy Secrets Underlying Kashrut: Meat & Dairy by Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok (PDF)</a> explained by Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok</sup></p>\n\n\n",

I've occasionally seen them in American supermarkets.</p>\n\n<p>With the early machines in the late 1800s, they'd have a giant roller cranking out a huge flat sheet of dough, then use big cookie-cutters on it. If you used round cookie-cutters, you'd either have to throw away all the dough in between the circle shapes, or would feel pressured to rework it within the 18 minutes, which is going to be hard to do. Therefore they were advised in fact to make them rectangular-shaped.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this raised eyebrows with some traditionalists: \"gevalt! Everyone knows a matza is supposed to be round!\" The Kesav Sofer (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=950&pgnum=264\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in a pamphlet known as <em>Bitul Moda'a</em>, printed in the back of his responsa on Orach Chaim</a>) briefly allowed for machine round matzas (or even theoretically a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_pentagonal_tiling\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pentagonal shape</a>), to give time for people to adjust, while pleading with people to accept the rectangular matzahs, \"and in this merit may Hashem gather us from the four corners of the world.\" (Groan.)</p>\n\n<p>With today's technology I'm sure they could make them round, but as noted that makes packaging more complicated. And besides, if the rabbis of 100+ years ago said that machine matzas should be rectangular, then by golly we'll make them rectangular!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, many people feel that the machine matzas can't be used for the seder (which is a different question.) If they started making round machine matzas (or handmade non-shmurah for that matter), people might eat sub-optimal matza seder night, or at least accuse the manufacturer of trying to cause such a confusing situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>If such <em>matzos</em> are rare or nonexistent, it's because they don't fit as well in a box and thus require either</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>a round box, which costs more to make and assemble, or</li>\n<li>both\n<ol>\n<li>more box space per <em>matza</em>, taking up valuable room in shipping etc., and</li>\n<li>empty space in each box, increasing the likelihood of breaking <em>matzos</em>.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Source (so to speak): conjecture.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In Holland, round matzot were made before the Shoa; the only matze available is made by the matza factory <a href=\"http://www.annefrank.org/en/Subsites/Annes-Amsterdam/Timeline/Before-the-war/1934/1934/Joop-Zoutberg--De-Haan-factory-in-the-Valkenburgerstraat-makes-matzos-for-Passover/#!/en/Subsites/Annes-Amsterdam/Timeline/Before-the-war/1934/1934/Joop-Zoutberg--De-Haan-factory-in-the-Valkenburgerstraat-makes-matzos-for-Passover/?viewtype=Eyewitness\">de Haan, Valkenburgerstraat, Amsterdam</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hollandiamatzes.nl/en/\">Hollandia Matza in Enschede</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After the Shoa until today, you can buy round machine matzot from Hollandia matzes.</p>\n\n\n",

Dina d'malchusa dina.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The problem here is that Kalashnikover_Rebbe doesn't understand how ad blocking software works, nor how online advertising works.  You cannot compare online advertising to offline advertising.  They might have the same purpose, and the same name, but they are completely different things.</p>\n<p>First, online ads are measured in \"Clicks\" as well as \"Eyeballs\".</p>\n<p>Advertising in general in the non-interactive sphere, works on statistical models and general usage, and a lot of unknown information. Online advertising works because of precise, recorded, and individualized information.  The main difference between advertising on a billboard or TV or Radio, is that the information only flows in one direction.  Advertisement to person.  But on the internet, information flows in two directions. The ads and the person being advertised to, interact with each other.  It's more like walking into a store and engaging with a sales person, than it is viewing an ad.</p>\n<p>There is a large \"pipeline\" of the way advertising works on the internet.</p>\n<p>First, you have the ad agency, which creates the ad.  Some company hires an ad agency to create an ad.  The ad agency is then given a budget of how much they can pay various websites to display the ad.  This part of the contract is never affected by ad blockers or the like.</p>\n<p>The next step is that the ad agency (or an ad aggregator such as Google or DoubleClick) sets up a deal with various websites.  This deal depends on where the ads are shown, how popular the website is, et cetera.  Here, a term is used to measure the effectiveness of the ad. CPM (Clicks per M (either thousand or Million))  Meaning the Ad Agency tells website X, that I will give you $1.00 for every thousand people who click on the ad.  Using various other metrics, a website might argue that their users are more prone to click and then purchase an item than other websites and might demand a $5.00 CPM or a website might have completely random ads and only be offered $0.25 CPM.  This part of the contract and process is highly affected by ad blockers.</p>\n<p>There are two types of ad blockers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ad blocker stops the ad from being retrieved from the server in the first place.</li>\n<li>The ad blocker lets the ad be retrieved from the server, but then hides it, making it invisible to the user.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of those types of ad blockers affects, a different person in the chain, and is potentially stealing from different parties.</p>\n<p>The first type of ad blocker, creates a discrepancy, between the statistics of the ad company and the statistics of the website which gets paid for the ads.  The ad company will see that only 10,000 ads were \"viewed\"; and, of those 10,000 views, 100 people clicked.  However, the website owner will see that page was viewed 50,000 times, but only 100 people clicked.  If the website company is honest, this will greatly hurt the relationship between the ad agency and the website.  So, in this case, this ad blocker, may not be 'stealing', but it is definitely \"putting a stumbling block\", causing the website owner to lie and be dishonest with the ad agency company.  Because they will use the 50,000 views number when setting up the initial CPM, but will be getting paid based on the 10,000 number giving them more money.   In other words, by using the ad blocker in this scenario, you are effectively making it very hard for the Website company to resist using \"false weights and measures\".  I know this, because I had to quit a job over this issue. The pressure was just too high, to not be false about what was happening.  The ad agency wanted to \"dump\" ads from their budget in X amount of time, and the hosting websites wanted to make more money. There was no incentive for any individual party to be honest. (Very similar to what happened in the mortgage scandals)</p>\n<p>The second type of ad blocker, gives the ad agency, and the website the same statistics.  However, those statistics are wrong, and nobody will know why.  Everybody will think that 50,000 views are being seen, and that the ads are viewed 50,000 times, but only 100 people click.  They will assume then, that the ads are placed in the wrong part of the page, or the wrong type of ads are being displayed.  But the reality, is that they are getting 10,000 views of the ad, and 100 clicks. (Which is the expected rate).  This means the website company will spend many days and hours and time trying to \"improve their Click rate\".  Here you are stealing with <em>geneivat daat</em>.    I can not tell you the number of hours and days and stress and even one UX expert losing their job, because they insisted the Ads were placed in the best place possible, but data was not showing improved results.  I do not know if that was because of ad blockers, poorly chosen ads, or just a bad audience. But, if it was because of ad blockers, nobody would be able to know, and the assumption is that it's the designer's fault for not getting more clicks.</p>\n<p>The fact that ad blockers are not enforceable to legislate against, or that people demand freedom of their computer screens and so nobody would be willing to legislate against them, doesn't remove the fact that they can in theory cause serious harm and damages to people who's lives and livelihoods depend on those ads being displayed and recorded accurately.</p>\n\n\n",

The talmud says they continued to be carried out through divine providence (<a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/dafyomi2/sanhedrin/points/sn-ps-037.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 37b</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>(Rav Yosef): After the Mikdash was destroyed, even though the Sanhedrin does not sit (in its place, to judge capital cases), the\n  four death penalties did not cease.</li>\n  <li>Objection: Indeed, they ceased!</li>\n  <li><p>Correction: Rather, death according to the four death penalties did not cease:</p>\n  \n  <p>i.

Someone deserving of the sword, the kingdom kills him (e.g. by a guillotine) or robbers stab him;\n  iv.

Sometimes, you have to be harsh to someone to save the society.</p>\n\n<p>Note that it was extremely rare that such things ever happened because the study and observance of torah shielded people from committing such things. Today it is not even viewed as something so morally bad.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: to clarify a bit more. <strong>God considers sins of sexual immorality to be very severe</strong>. This can be seen from many places such as (1) the plague at the end of parsha Balak, (2) Yosef's tribe would not have been in the Choshen had he sinned with Potifar's wife (Sotah 36b) and of course, <strong>the plague of the flood in the days of Noach, whose primary sin was sexual immorality</strong> as explained <a href=\"http://www.jtsa.edu/prebuilt/ParashahArchives/5763f/noah.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. (This is your problem - you do not see what is the big deal in sexual immorality.)</p>\n\n<p>It's important to also realize that as the Chovos Halevavos writes (<a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=380\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shaar Bitachon</a> gate 4): \"The punishment in both worlds, however, is through truth and justice, and it is a debt a man must pay.\" The purpose of suffering in this world or in Gehinom (hell) is as the Ramchal writes (Kalach Pitchei Chachma, petach #2): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the Divine will coordinates the matters so that in the end, all will\n  be meritorious (see Derech H-shem part 2 ch.2-4). This demonstrates\n  that the Divine will is truly and solely to bestow good, only that it\n  is necessary to go with each person according to his way. For the\n  wicked it is necessary to punish them <strong>in order to pardon them</strong>\n  afterwards. If the intent [in punishing the wicked] was to expel them,\n  they should have been completely banished - not that they be punished\n  in order to make them meritorious afterwards. This is a clear proof,\n  because behold the end of a matter reveals the intended purpose of all\n  the parts of that matter. And the end of the matter for every human\n  being, whether the righteous or the wicked [after they are rectified]\n  is to bestow on them good. If so, the intended purpose is to bestow\n  good on all. Hence, the Divine will is solely good. Therefore, nothing\n  will endure except His good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, the death penalty is actually a great kindness, because through it and repentance the offender will be pardoned of his sin, so that he will be able to enter Gan Eden scott free and will be spared of the much harsher purification process in Gehinom.</p>\n\n<p>It only appears barbaric to us, because we do not see the big picture.</p>\n\n<p>All punishments in the torah must be seen in context of God's benevolence and kindness as the Chovos Halevavos writes (ibid ch.3) \"God is absolutely generous and kind\" (Tov Halevanon commentary: i.e. the greatest possible extreme of generosity and kindness)</p>\n\n\n",

The custom everywhere I have ever seen is to remove two Sifrei Torah from the ark for the two readings and to wrap up the first before reading from the second. This custom is very appropriate for other special second readings which are often far apart, as this saves time for the congregation instead of waiting while the scroll is rolled. </p>\n\n<p>However, the readings this morning were only about 8 columns apart from each other! In my mind it is certain that rolling the scroll forward eight columns takes much less time than wrapping up the first Torah and opening the second. This is in fact our practice for the reading on a fast day, which skips from Exodus <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0232.htm#11\">32:14</a> to <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0234.htm\">34:1</a>, a gap of approximately 2 columns, yet we only use one scroll.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone suggest using just one scroll when the second reading is this close?</p>\n\n<p>I note that the same question applies to Rosh Chodesh on Parashat Chukat when the gap is from Numbers <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0422.htm\">22:1</a> to <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0428.htm#9\">28:9</a>, also a gap of about 8 columns.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>You are right.

Why the plural? Plain translation would indicate we are speaking of the Mishkan.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>“Mikdash” is a more generic term for a “holy place” or (following Rav S. R. Hirsch) a “sorce of holiness”. The Mishkan was the specific Mikdash built in the desert.  (Note the same root SH-K-N in <em>mishkan</em> and <em>v’shakhanti</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>For your second question, God is not promising merely to dwell in the tent built for Him but to be an active Presence within the nation: “Let them build Me a holy place and I will dwell <strong>among them</strong>.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=2&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gemara (Eruvin 2A-3B)</a> actually uses this verse to prove that a Mikdash is sometimes called a Mishkan. \n(Actually, that Gemara actually says that \"Mikdash\" and \"Mishkan\" are interchangeable terms).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16021&st=&pgnum=260\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> explains that according to Rashi (the simple explanation of the text), one cannot say that \"Veshanchanti Besocham\" is a result of \"Veasu Li Mikdash\" (like some commentaries explain that through building the Mishkan, Hashem will dwell in each Jew or that through dwelling in the Mishkan it's considered that Hashem dwells in each Jew) since then the verse should have stressed \"Vehachanti Bo\" (the <strong>main</strong> dwelling is in the Mishkan) and then said in a different location how that translates to Hashem dwelling among the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, according to Rashi, the verse should be read \"And you shall make me a tabernacle (and as a side point, through keeping the command to build the Mishkan, I will I will dwell among you) according to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Yes, the Bible allowed it, though never said it was a good thing. Nobody does it today except for a few Yemenites.</em></p>\n\n<p>I am curious where Judaism stands as a whole and as a religion when facing opposition from civil law. In the adjoining questions some parts of Judaism took the ban of the Rabbi and others acknowledged it but merely fell into step with the civil laws of state. </p>\n\n<p>However there is an acknowledgement of the fact that there are a few that still practice a piece of behavior as supported by fair interpretation of religious texts that go against common Western law.</p>\n\n<p>In a country such as the US where legislation is <strong>not</strong> supposed to interfere in the practice of religious belief; the question I have is:</p>\n\n<p>Does Judaism have a stance (in modern day) on pushing back against civil law where applicable or simply accepting and adapting to the civil decree.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I've tried to ask this in as generic and unpolitically biased way as I can. The specifics are based on a friend who asked me why he couldn't challenge polygamy rules based on his Jewish faith.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Basically:</p>\n\n<p>If Jewish law says \"permitted\", and civil law says \"forbidden\", we will stop doing that thing to get along well with the civil authorities.  (Sefardi Jews, who have no rabbinic ban on polygamy, sticking to monogamous marriages in America, is a good example of this.)</p>\n\n<p>However:</p>\n\n<p>If Jewish law says \"REQUIRED\", and civil law says \"forbidden\" - and the civil authorities are like those in the USA, who allow citizens and groups to peacefully disagree, debate, and lobby against government policy - we will certainly do so.</p>\n\n<p>The Orthodox Union* has a political action wing, which lobbies government entities whenever a threat to Orthodox Jewish life and practice is perceived.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few recent examples of this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/general_article/ou_objects_to_president_obamas_budget_on_charities\">http://www.ou.org/general_article/ou_objects_to_president_obamas_budget_on_charities</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/general_article/ou_statement_on_new_jersey_same_sex_marriage_bill\">http://www.ou.org/general_article/ou_statement_on_new_jersey_same_sex_marriage_bill</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/02/17/jews-defend-catholics-birth-control/#more-784290\">http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/02/17/jews-defend-catholics-birth-control/#more-784290</a></p>\n\n<p>With regard to the same-sex marriage debate - at first glance, it seems like a case of Jewish law saying \"forbidden\" and civil law saying \"permitted\".  In that case, we typically don't get involved.  However - the interest in that political issue is to ensure that rabbis are never \"REQUIRED\" to perform a same-sex marriage, or possibly face a discrimination lawsuit if they are asked to do so, and refuse.  </p>\n\n<p>(You will note in that OU press release, they still say that the OU is against same-sex marriage on religious principle, but that they acknowledge that their most urgent concern, the political coercion of clergy, was addressed in that bill). </p>\n\n<p>*The Orthodox Union does not represent every Torah-observant Jew in America, nor does it claim to do so, but I use it as an example because it is the biggest and best organized institution which lobbies on behalf of Torah observance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On one hand it's interesting to note that most Western countries don't make this question a pressing matter.  They leave us alone when it comes to ritual law and accomodate us when it comes to civil (eg allowing 2 Jews to go to Beis Din instead of civil court in a money matter) law.<br>\nHowever, events in the last few years might increase the relevance of this issue.  Imagine, for example, a ban on circumcision except for when deemed essential by a specialist.  There is no question that Jews would have to defy the law despite a general commitment towards being good citizens wherever we live.\nAnother issue would be shechita and proposed bans on it in parts of Europe.\nIt therefore remains essential that Jews stay involved in the political process to ensure conflicts like this do not arise.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is 'misod chachomim unevonim' sometimes said and sometimes omitted in the repetition of the Amidah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Askenazi communities, the piece beginning 'misod chachomim unevonim' is said at the repetition of the Amidah at Shacharis when there are piyuttim (except Purim) and on Musaf on Yomim Noraim as well as, in my Machzor, at Mincha and Neilah on Yom Kippur. </p>\n\n<p>I thought the reason was to establish permission to “interrupt” the Amidah with these additional prayers.</p>\n\n<p>But it is not said before the piyuttim in Musaf on (1) Shabbos Shekolim and (2) Shabbos Ha'Chodesh and at the beginning of the (3) Krovets on Purim morning. </p>\n\n<p>Why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Possibly the difference has to do with the structure of the piyutim in each case.</p>\n\n<p>The halachah is that you're allowed to add any kind of requests, even private ones, in the middle berachos of Shemoneh Esrei (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 119</a>:1), and you can add public ones even in the first and last ones (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid. 112</a>:1). In either case, though, the addition has to be thematically related to the berachah.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably, then, the relatively short paragraphs inserted into the berachos, in the instances mentioned in the question, are closely related enough to their parent berachos to not need any kind of special \"request for permission\" (which is basically what Misod is). In fact, I have a volume of ancient piyutim (found in the Cairo genizah) for individual Shabbasos throughout the year (מחזורי שבעתות לסדרים ולפרשות, ed. Shulamit Elitzur), from which it seems that there were times and places where they used these as <em>replacements</em> for the original bodies of the berachos (i.e., the chazzan would begin his repetition of Shemoneh Esrei by saying a four- or five-line piyut and then continue בא\"י מגן אברהם, etc.) - so that there is precedent for considering these to be basically alternate versions of the berachos rather than interpolations.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas when there are longer piyutim, even though the ones inserted in the berachos do (usually) end with a phrase containing the main theme of the berachah, it may be much harder to justify them on that basis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I one time heard, although I do not recall the source, that we say it whenever there is an interruption between the Bracha of Mechayei Maisim and Kedusha, and we do not say it when there is no interruption between the Bracha of Mechayei Maisim and Kedusha. Thus the times you mentioned that it is not said, there is no interruption at that point and therefore it is not necessary to say.</p>\n\n\n",

Jews in <em>Shushan</em> fought the 13h and 14th and had respite the 15th. Jews elsewhere fought the 13th alone and had respite the 14th. So for Jews in Shushan to celebrate on the 14th seems incongruous (though perhaps they should fast that day, as they do the 13th). And for Jews in New York (for example) to celebrate on the 15th seems irrelevant: the 15th is just another day on the calendar, no more celebratory than the 16th or the 17th.</p>\n\n<p>The only reason I can think of to celebrate on both days is that Jews elsewhere are doing so, and we like to share one another's joy.<sup>[1]</sup> But that's conjecture, and seems IMO weak as an <strong>obligatory</strong> reason. I seek a source for a reason we celebrate both the 14th and the 15th of <em>Adar</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1]</sup> Indeed, I've heard that given, with no source AFAIR, as the reason we do <em>hakafos</em> in <em>chutz laaretz</em> on <em>lel Sh'mini Atzeres</em>, and in Israel on <em>motzae Sh'mini Atzeres</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=5b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megillah 5b</a> quotes the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megillat_Taanit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megillat Taanit</a> which extends the restrictions of fasting and giving eulogies to both days in all places.

I think this can help us understand Tosfot, in that since miracles and salvation happened on that day, the day itself attains a celebratory character. To what extent one applies that character (from skipping tachanun to having a second raucous feast) is likely debated among the rishonim, but it certainly provides basis for the Maharil's rule.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you go back to the text of Megillat Esther you can see that the holiday is actually supposed to be two days (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm#21\" rel=\"nofollow\">Esther 9:21</a>,27).

However, nowadays, that is no longer the case, and so it is normal presently in most cases for gerim to become Avraham, Ovadyah, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Avram became Avraham, and Sarai became Sarah.</p>\n\n<p>Why did this custom change, and why don't converts Hebraize their existing English name and add a letter of God's name the way that Abraham our Patriarch did?</p>\n\n<p>Also, why do gerim nowadays become Avraham, etc., because if there is nothing inherently wrong with using non-Jewish names back then, so what is wrong with using them now?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1502.htm#5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 2:5</a>) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מדרכי התשובה להיות השב צועק תמיד לפני ה', ...ומשנה שמו, כלומר שאני אחר\n  ואיני אותו האיש שעשה אותן המעשים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems from the Rambam that changing one's name has some sort of psychological effect. I understand it as a constant reminder that you <em>aren't</em> the same person as you were before; there's something <em>different</em> about you now. Similarly, a convert would be constantly reminded of his new way of life by his new name. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I don't know if it is in fact normative for converts today to change their names.  I know at least a couple dozen converts across the spectrum, and the only one who made a name change didn't do anything legally -- she started using her middle name because she found her given name (Christina) awkward.  As for converts in torah, Avraham and Sarah changed their names but Yitro and Ruth did not, so it seems like there's precedent either way.  (Also, <em>God</em> changed Avraham and Sarah's names; they didn't decide that themselves.)  So I dispute the premise of the question.</p>\n\n<p>As for why people might choose not to do this today: changing one's legal name is a hassle!  If it's not part of marriage then you have to go to court, and then you have to update a bunch of legal documents and employer records and insurance policies and all sorts of other stuff.  If you've published under the old name, then you have to figure out how to make that transition too if it still matters to you.  (Blogs are easy; prior print or academic publications, not so much.)  Since there's not a strong need (else more people would do it) and there's no reason to think God cares about people's <em>secular</em> names, why do it when you'll use your (new) Hebrew name, not your secular name, in ritual contexts anyway?  Isn't that enough of a new name?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In my very limited Israeli experience, some converts change their names and some do not - but what's significant is that the <em>choice</em> to change the name has to do with a desire to <strong>symbolically disown your previous life, your previous identity</strong>. This often (though not always) coincides with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disconnecting from non-religious/non-Jewish friends.</li>\n<li>Moving into some religious commune or family.</li>\n<li>Moving someplace else in the country.</li>\n<li>Changing one's appearance, e.g. growing facial hair.</li>\n<li>Changing one's style of dress, to give clearer fashion markers of religious people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these also happen in the reverse direction when religious people become secular or atheist (Chozrim be-She'ela as opposed to Chozrim bi-Tshuva is a common term), although a name change is less common in that direction, I believe.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, one would be allowed to tell a mohel that he is interested in hiring him for a job.</p>\n\n<p>There is a debate over how much one can talk about (Rema OC <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow\">306:3</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=199\" rel=\"nofollow\">6</a>).

Others say this is too close to the rabbinic decree of business activities (similar to transfering objects) which were forbidden under all circumstances (MB 306:14).  [The Mishna Berurah 306:32 equates the debate in 306:3 to 306:6 as well.]</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, whereas in 306:3 the Rema sides with the stricter approach to forbid making the deal (\"v'chen ikar\"), he says in 306:6 that the custom is to be lenient and make specific pledges to charity or to pay the chazan (\"v'haminhag l'hakil\").  </p>\n\n<p>So, since you are setting a price for a spiritual deal to eat an afikomen (that you can just take another out of the box does not undermine the spiritual aspect of the \"stolen\" matza), and you are not transferring the possession since it's already yours, you are at least in line with the \"custom\".</p>\n\n\n",

I'm thinking of obligatory <em>t'filos</em> like <em>sh'mone esre</em> and \"<em>Sh'ma</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>I know one can speak <em>t'fila</em> quietly, even very quietly; in fact, <em>sh'mone esre</em> is said quietly. I'm not asking about loudness versus quietness but specifically about whispering. As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whispering\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> notes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In normal speech, the vocal cords alternate between states of voice and voicelessness. In whispering,… the vocal cords alternate between whisper and voicelessness (though the acoustic difference between the two states is minimal).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, whispering is speaking without the use — or with minimal use — of the vocal cords. All consonants and vowels become largely or completely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_%28phonetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">devoiced</a>. This is independent of loudness: it can be done pretty loudly, and normal speaking can be done quietly.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%90#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.99.D7.96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The words תִּזְכְּרוּ and תִּשְׂכְּרוּ</a> thus come out almost the same — but not quite. One difference lies in the fact that whispering generally doesn't <em>completely</em> remove voice (as noted in the Wikipedia quotation, above). Another lies in the fact that for some people the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">place of articulation</a> of a <em>zayin</em> is slightly different than that of a <em>sin</em>, or one is more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">closed</a> than the other. Also, the preceding <em>chirik</em> may <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">differ slightly</a>, e.g. in length, between the two words. Finally, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/3\">WAF</a> notes in a comment, below, that people often <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_%28phonetics%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lengthen</a> normally-voiced consonants when whispering, and suggests that that might suffice to distinguish them from the normally unvoiced ones.)</p>\n\n<p>Is there any source or argument that says that <em>t'fila</em> can or cannot be done in a whisper?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In the beginning of Shmuel 1, we have the story Chana davening for a son.

However, she was shown to be \"in the right\", so to speak, and Eli blessed her and left. I don't have a source for this, I have heard this story used as a proof that davening in a whisper is perfectly acceptable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The mishna in Berakhot 2:3 records the following dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the <i>tana qama</i>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הקורא את שמע ולא השמיע לאזנו - יצא. רבי יוסי אומר: לא יצא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who reads the <i>Shema'</i> but not so that his ear hears it has fulfilled\n  his obligation. Rabbi Yosei says, he has not fulfilled his obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara (Berakhot 15a) understands Rabbi Yosei to be interpreting the word <i>shema'</i> as \"hear\": read it in Hebrew, and make sure that it's audible. The <i>tana qama</i>, they suggest, interprets the word <i>shema'</i> as \"understand\": recite it in any language, even (presumably) in a whisper. The halakha is as the <i>tana qama</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Hilkhot Qeri'at Shema' 2:8) is emphatic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצריך להשמיע לאזנו כשהוא קורא ואם לא השמיע לאזנו יצא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One needs to make sure that he hears it [the <i>Shema'</i>] as he is\n  reading, but if he does not make it audible, he has fulfilled his\n  obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So too, by the way, with the Tur and the Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chaim 62:3) - although they both add the stipulation that <i>some</i> sound has to come out, even if you can't hear it. Just thinking the words is insufficient.</p>\n\n<p>As for blessings, this appears also to have been the subject of debate. A mishna in Megillah 2:4 forbids a deaf person from reading megillat Esther, and the gemara (Megillah 19b) likens that to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as mentioned above. In presenting his opinion, however, they bring a beraita that attributes to Rabbi Yosei the assertion that one who recites <i>birqat hamazon</i> silently has not fulfilled his obligation, over against the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda who permits making silent berakhot.</p>\n\n<p>The halakha here, as earlier, is not like Rabbi Yosei. The law, as it's presented in the Tur and Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chaim 206:3) is that one should make one's berakhot audible, but one has fulfilled one's obligation even if he didn't - so long, again, as <i>some</i> sound is produced. This is contrary to the opinion of the Rambam (Hilkhot Berakhot 1:7), who holds that berakhot can be made altogether silently.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Unless one's hearing is impaired, or unless the sound is being drowned out by another source, it is physiologically impossible to say words that are inaudible to one's own ears <i>without</i> whispering. Although none of the sources mentioned above use the verb ל.ח.ש (\"whisper\"), it is to whispering that they are clearly referring.</p>\n\n\n",

There are some that match up fairly well, like Sarah in English and Hebrew, and there are some that are close with a phonetically similar first initial, such as Michael and Moshe.  There are also some that have some visual similarity, in that the transliteration of the Hebrew word commonly uses a letter that is then adopted as the starting point for choosing a name in the vernacular language, such as Shlomo and Steven/Stephen.  Finally, there are those that use completely unrelated names, sometimes seizing the opportunity to give different additional names in honor or memory of additional people.  I've seen this further developed into giving someone a vernacular name after a close friend or relative who was not Jewish or did not have a Hebrew name, and a Hebrew name for someone who was Jewish with a Hebrew name.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note, also, that I'm using the word 'Hebrew' loosely; many times the \"Jewish\" name is not Hebrew at all, but Yiddish, Aramaic, or even Greek, Arabic, or Farsi.</p>\n\n\n",

Indeed, when we follow the chain back we do see that many/most/all of the sources which discuss do so in the context of the berachah m'chayeh hameisim. It seems to me that we are left with two opposing challenges:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>On what basis do we learn the MB as applying this halachah to both cases? While my limited survey it seems that most secondary sources and apparently <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/14378/899\">other Poskim</a> learn the Misheh Berurah that way, is this really necessary. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=277\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Berurah 225:2</a> writes, \"ואם קבל ממנו כתב או שאנשים הודיעהו משלומו, יש דעות באחרונים, וספק ברכות להקל\" with no specific mention of the berachah shecheyanu. If we infer it from the location the se'if katan commented on (הרואה את חברו), at the head of the halachah where both berachos are located, then the same is true of the Sha'arei Teshuvah which writes, \"ומ\"ש בשם <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=723&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלק\"ט</a> בקבל ממנו כתב כו', וע\"ש דמשמע שאף אם באו אנשים שהודיעו משלומו, וכן ב<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7626&st=&pgnum=117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בר\"י</a> בשם מז\"ה משמע דגם אם הוא יודע משלומו אף שלא כתב לו אין מברך,וצ\"ע\" which is commenting on the same location and neither mentions both blessings explicitly nor limits the ruling to one blessing. Do we have reason to learn this Mishneh Berurah as applying to both berachos, and if so on what basis do we not learn the Sha'arei Teshuvah in the same manner to deny the Mishneh Berurah precedent (even if it only pushes the question back onto Sha'arei Teshuvah).</p></li>\n<li><p>Conversely, on what basis do we make a distinction between the two blessings throughout the Gemara and Poskim the halachos pertaining to the חבר are given jointly, with the only explicit distinction being whether the friend has been gone  30 days or 12 months. Given that all other halachos regarding who this berachah is said upon seeing are identical, what precedent do we have for making a distinction. If we learn Mishneh Berurah and/or Sha'arei Teshuvah as treating these berachos as equivalent, what is to prevent them from learning the earlier poskim who mention the issues of receiving letters with respect the the berachah m'chayeh hameisim as being \"lav davka\" (such as the aforementioned Birchei Yosef, perhaps others may not be as open to such an interpretation)? During those generations I suspect (just a hypothesis) that sending a letter to someone who had been gone less than an month wasn't exactly practical and presumably uncommon. Where, other than Rav Ovadiah Yosef, do we see explicit basis to differentiate the situations where these blessings are said beyond the defining difference of the length of absence?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Two points:</p>\n\n<p>1) We know the Mishna Berura is referring to Shehechiyanu because in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=277\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sha'ar HaTziyun sk 3</a> he explicitly mentions the word \"Shehechiyanu\".</p>\n\n<p>2) The Aruch HaShulchan (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%94#.D7.A1.D7.99.D7.9E.D7.9F_.D7.A8.D7.9B.D7.94_.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.91\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 225:2</a>) explicitly differentiates like Rav Ovadiah Yosef:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזהו כשלא היה מכתבים ממנו אליו, אבל כשקבל ממנו מכתב אינו מברך 'מחיה המתים', אבל לעניין 'שהחיינו' אין חילוק, דאפילו קיבל מכתב בתוך ל' מברך 'שהחיינו'. והטעם דברכת 'שהחיינו' היא מתוך שמחת הראייה פנים בפנים, אבל ברכת 'מחיה המתים' הוא מצד שעתה נתוודע שהוא חי, ולכן כיון שכבר ידע שהוא חי על פי מכתבים או שמע מבני אדם שהוא חי שוב לא שייך ברכת 'מחיה המתים'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems the reason to split is based on the text of the blessing which implies different forms of emotion (joy over seeing vs joy over living).</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Also, it seems the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=723&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halchot Ketanot 1:220</a> (quoted Be'er Heitev 225:1 and in the Sha'arei Teshuva you quote) explicitly differentiates between the two and says \"possibly to not say Mechaye HaMetein but certainly <strong>to</strong> say Shehchiyanu.\" Note that this work <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%97%D7%92%D7%99%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">dates from 1704</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm looking for an explanation as to why this is necessarily so. Meaning, why should things ever come to and end at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>I wondered about this fact myself for a while, and so I looked up the sources.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that this idea is based on only two sources.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud has an aggadatot which says:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin [97a]: “Rav Kattina said: ‘The world will\n  exist for 6000 years and one (thousand) of destruction’ ... We have a\n  teaching which is in agreement with Rav Kattina, as the seventh is the\n  sabbatical year – one in seven years. Likewise the world will rest\n  1,000 in 7000 … ‘a thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday\n  which has passed …’ [Psalms 90:4].”</p>\n  \n  <p>Talmud, Tractate Avodah Zarah [9a]: “The world will exist for six\n  thousand years: two millennia of void (‘tohu’); Two millennia of\n  Torah; and then two millennia of the age of Moshiach.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the context of these statements are ones which in my mind, prove to be false certainties. (Not that they are false, but to state that they are certain is false) The midrashim can certainly be understood in different ways, and if understood literally, these midrashim have proven so far, to be false.  Arguments against the general idea, being a \"necessity\" can be <a href=\"http://rabbisedley.com/?q=tos/bereishit\">found here</a>:  Basically, we have \"conflicting midrashim\", as well as knowledge that the physical planet is not only 5772 years old.</p>\n\n<p>I should add, that there is an opinion that there have been many 7,000 year cycles already. (mentioned in the link above, in some midrashim)  So the fact that things rise and fall, and come in cycles is no chidush to the world we live in.  The idea that once the 7,000 year cycle is over, that there will be no more cycles after that, is also unfounded.  In some ways, since the invention of the steam engine, or the internet, (and a myriad of other historical events) the world has ended \"as we know it.\"</p>\n\n\n",

I realize that the best approach to addressing this is probably to engage in a deep study of middot, but are there smaller, incremental things one can do to at least start down the path?  Where does one start -- what are the right sources to study or prayers/practices to take on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Oddly enough, the means to \"remove Chametz\" from our souls is very nicely laid out in the Chasidic practices of the 49 days of Sefirat Haomer.  If you search the internet, you will find numerous 49 step programs, that a person can do, each day to make themselves a better person and have a better relationship with Gd, thus removing the \"Chametz\".</p>\n\n<p>Now that you ask the question, I find it odd that nobody has such programs for the 15 days before Pesach. Or even 30 days from Purim to Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>However, I would argue that Purim and it's meanings is a good place to start.  After all, Yom Kipurim, is \"like Purim\", so Purim itself must be a very cleansing holiday.  Perhaps that is why there is no 30 day program from Purim to Pesach, but instead the \"program\" is done during Sefirat HaOmer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It surely can only do good to learn a little mussar each day.

Tosafos there (ד\"ה ומפקא) points out that Tanna D'vei Chizkiyah must therefore necessarily understand the case in Exodus to be talking about where the assailant <em>did</em> intend to kill the woman, and then he is indeed subject to the death penalty; they would exempt him only if indeed he didn't intend to hit her.

The question is — and is asked by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14294&pgnum=364\" rel=\"nofollow\">the <em>Mizrachi</em></a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14036&pgnum=40\" rel=\"nofollow\">the <em>Minchas Shay</em></a> — that no extant <em>m'sora</em> agrees with him. They offer no answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Even though we do not have this extra 'vav' in our Sifrei Torah, and even though the Minchas Shai who was a contemporary of the Ramban states that he has never seen a Sefer Torah with this extra 'vav', nevertheless, the fact is not only did Rashi have it, but also the Ibn Ezra and the Chizkuni. Therefore, it would be useful to try and understand why the 'vav' logically <strong>should</strong> be there according to their Sifrei Torah.</p>\n\n<p>First let us look at the posuk again with the <em>taamei mikra</em> - the cantillation notes.</p>\n\n<p>וְנֽוֹעַדְתִּ֣י לְךָ֮ שָׁם֒ וְדִבַּרְתִּ֨י אִתְּךָ֜ מֵעַ֣ל הַכַּפֹּ֗רֶת מִבֵּין֙ שְׁנֵ֣י הַכְּרֻבִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־אֲר֣וֹן הָֽעֵדֻ֑ת אֵ֣ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֧ר אֲצַוֶּ֛ה אֽוֹתְךָ֖ אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל</p>\n\n<p>Note that under the word העדת there is a note which looks like an upside down Y. This is called an <em>esnachta</em>, and it indicates a pause in the middle of the posuk (all or nearly all the posukim of the Torah have such a note in the middle), something like a semi-colon that we use in our sentences. Because of this pause, the two parts of the posuk need to make independent sense, and in our posuk if there is no 'vav' the second part of the posuk says \"all that I will command you unto the Children of Israel\", which makes no sense by itself.</p>\n\n<p>But Rashi and the Ibn Ezra deal with this 'vav' in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra understands the first part of the posuk \"I will arrange My meetings with you there, and I will speak with you from atop the ark cover from between the two cherubim that are upon the Ark of the Testimony\" to mean that Hashem will communicate privately with Moshe, teaching him secrets and answering his questions, and he explains that the phrase \"I will speak\" also applies to the second half of the posuk: \"and (I will speak) all that I will command you unto the Children of Israel\". Hence we see how according to the Ibn Ezra the second half of the posuk makes sense with the 'vav'. (The Chizkuni understands the posuk in a similar fashion).</p>\n\n<p>But Rashi deals with the 'vav' by calling it superfluous and subservient and thus ignores it, since he understands that the simple explanation of the posuk is to read the complete posuk as one statement, that Hashem is communicating to Moshe only that which he is to tell the Children of Israel. But since the posuk in reality has a 'vav' there is also a different, deeper understanding of the posuk, reading it in two halves. (Possibly Rashi thinks that the explanation of the Ibn Ezra (or something similar) that Hashem also communicates there secrets to Moshe, is the deeper understanding).</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion I should point out that in practical terms it makes no difference whether in fact the Torah is supposed to have a 'vav' there or not, since Chazal have already told us that we are not expert in all the 'vavs' in the Torah, and thus the Torah is valid either way.</p>\n\n\n",

Even nowadays in Spain all the shepherds gather twice a year for a council meeting… and their food is meat and milk — and kid meat is the one they like best in that dish. I also looked into the matter and ascertained that in the far island called England, which has many sheep, more than around these parts, they always do this too.</p>\n<p>I think that really it was for this reason that God warned them that when they gather at <em>Sukos</em> they must not cook a kid in milk as [non-Jews] do.

The Temple is a  concrete sign of Gd's involvement in our world. It is a location where any human being, and not just a prophet is able to physically feel Gd's presence, and to have their soul  atoned for and cleansed.  This remarkable experience, is not only for the Jewish people either. During  the holiday of Sukkoth, people from all nations and all religions will be welcomed and able to feel this holy experience.   Because of the shared holy experience, people will recognize that all human beings are the Children of Gd, and all people will recognize the planet as Gd's creation and will therefore, be inspired by Gd and will cease having jealousy and other character traits that would lead to war.  The knowledge that not only is Gd real, but they can petition Gd and feel close to the Divine while on Earth, will result in world peace and proper human behavior.</p>\n\n<p>The Messiah is required to build the Temple, because only somebody as holy as the Messiah must be and who is a prophet can rebuild the Temple, since it is Gd's Temple and not humanity's.</p>\n\n<p>As for the location of the Temple and the current location of the Dome of the Rock, that is a solution that it would appear only the Messiah can resolve.  Or rather, someone who is able to convince everybody how to do it, and not cause conflict, must be the Messiah.</p>\n\n<p>If one searches the internet, there are many people who have suggestions of how this can happen.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>An earthquake or other divine action causes the Dome to collapse, and Gd's Temple is built in it's place.</li>\n<li>The location of the Dome of the Rock might be \"off\", and Gd's Temple can then instead be built in it's proper location, with the Shrine sitting just outside it's walls.</li>\n<li>Any mosques or shrines on the temple mount can be incorporated into the Temple that is built.</li>\n<li>Since the Temple would exist for all of humanity, perhaps there will be different units or sections for each of the 70 nations or religions.  (This idea is not a Jewish one, but I figured I'd throw it out there anyways)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Why doesn't it <strong>(the day of Rosh Chodesh <em>itself</em>)</strong> resemble <em>Yom Kippur</em> in that way, which is full of <em>selichot</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The kapparah of Rosh Chodesh is different than the regular type.</p>\n<p>On one level, the goat offered as a chatas on this day (also on the other Yamim Tovim, incidentally, except for Yom Kippur) is to atone for cases of tum'ah involving the Beis Hamikdash or sacred foods where there was \"no knowledge at the beginning or the end\" - in other words, the person never knew that he was tamei before he entered the Beis Hamikdash or ate the food, and never found out afterwards either. (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=26&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shevuos 2a</a>)</p>\n<p>So perhaps this makes it inappropriate for us to substitute for this tachanun or selichos, in which we regret the sins that we do know of (which we may have done deliberately or inadvertently) and ask Hashem to forgive us for them.</p>\n<p>On a deeper level, too, there is the idea that the kapparah is not for us but, so to speak, for Hashem's having diminished the moon's size* (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=60b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chullin 60b</a>). Again, then, this wouldn't fit with us mentioning our own misdeeds.</p>\n<p>(What about the phrase לכל תולדותם, apparently implying that the kapparah is \"for all generations\" of Jews? <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/kuzari/kuzari3.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kuzari (3:5)</a>, cited in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14268&pgnum=215\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beis Yosef (Orach Chaim 423)</a>, states that indeed תולדותם means \"the rebirths of the months\" - i.e., that Rosh Chodesh is a time of atonement for the entire month, and perhaps also this includes the idea that it is an atonement for the very fact that the moon needs to reborn each month.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>* What does this mean? A lot of different explanations have been given, but <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2803/jewish/Who-Needs-Nudniks.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>'s one, from Chabad.org. Key paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...But the moon--even while still a \"great luminary\" itself--saw a deficiency in the status quo.</p>\n<p>You're right, said G-d. My entire creation is founded on the interplay between giver and taker, between the satisfied and the hungry... As you say, dear moon, two great luminaries won't do. Become small and dark and beg your light from the sun.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>G-d then tries to explain to the moon that the recipient's role is just as great as the giver's...</p>\n<p>And how does G-d feel about the whole thing? He feels terrible. After all, He set up the moon to it, as He set up all the nudniks, kvetchers and beggars of His world. It is He who imbued them with the hunger and sense of inadequacy that makes them so gloriously great while preventing them from comprehending their greatness.</p>\n<p>Forgive Me, says G-d. One day you'll see that it was all worth it, but until that day comes, I acknowledge My need for atonement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I've been to megilla readings in school auditoriums, in people's living rooms, and other places outside the <em>shul</em>. There is no inherent connection between hearing the megilla reading and a <em>shul</em> setting, and as such I don't see why there should be a requirement for a <em>mechitza</em> during reading.</p>\n\n<p>If you have sources that state otherwise, please let me know! It would raise the question of how the readings in other locations should be conducted.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It appears from the discussion in some Ashkenazic Achronim that a woman's mitzva is <em>to hear a megillah reading</em>, whereas a man's mitzva is <em>to read a megillah</em> (which can be fulfilled by listening to someone else fulfill their obligation). As men have a higher level of obligation, it can only be fulfilled by listening to someone with a greater than or equal level of obligation -- thus a man should really hear a man's reading.</p>\n\n<p>If a man is stuck someplace and his only option is to hear a woman reading megillah, well if he can take a megillah and more or less read the words himeself (cantillation notes aren't critical), better to do that. If the female reading is truly his only option, then I strongly presume he should go ahead and listen to that, as many Achronim will say he's still fulfilling his obligation.</p>\n\n<p>As for the mixed reading: In the second half of the twentieth century many great American rabbis felt the need to strongly demarcate between the Orthodox and Conservative movements, to the point of saying that an Orthodox fellow should not attend a non-mechitza Rosh HaShanah service, even if that means missing shofar blowing altogether.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to megillah reading -- often the reading is freestanding and not part of a prayer service; and a minority opinion would even count women for a \"minyan\" vis-a-vis the extra blessing at the end of the reading; hence I'd suspect there would be strong room to say better to hear in a mixed crowd than not to hear at all. If the reading was part of a non-mechitza prayer service in a heterodox synagogue it would be a lot more of a problem. (Better yet, if the reading is held in someone's home and not open to the public, or a rare event, then the mechitza is a preference but not a requirement -- <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/56/21\">see here for more</a>.)

I will say that the blanket heter that you are conceiving of does not exist. Though there can be found specific examples and certain \"loopholes\" to certain halakhic issues, the general reason for what kiruv organizations do are not solely based on those heterim. The general consensus among kiruv organizations is that in order to bring them closer certain compromises are made. It is a decision both on the part of the organization and on the part of the rabbis running it. Many a time do rabbis have to face such decisions. A classic one would be allowing a non-shomar shabbat congregant read from the torah or be the shliakh tsibbur. Classically halakha does not allow this (even if there MIGHT be way of reinterpreting halakha), but rabbis had to allow it in order to maintain their congregation, to be kind and fair, and to conform to the reality we exist in.\nall this said, there is a limit and a balance involved. Sometimes the balance can be lost, but the hope is that it will be achieved.\nIf you want, I can find something that validates what I just said, but I have spoken to several kiruv organizations and heard many rabbis say this. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am unaware of blanket heteirim but perhaps the discussion regarding inviting a non-orthodox person for shabbos knowing she will drive may shed some light here.

Ya’akov Ariel points out that in R. Akiva Eiger’s case, the other person is definitely saved from a greater sin. In our case, the invitee may not be religiously inspired and may have otherwise stayed home and done nothing. On the other hand, the guest will definitely violate Shabbos in the future. Perhaps we can permit lifnei iveir for the chance to prevent these definite violations in the future just like we violate Shabbos to save someone’s life so he can observe Shabbos in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Hebrew form of it (\"Yehudi\") first appears (I believe) in Megillas Esther and in Zechariah. Before that, Jews were referred to as \"Ivrim\" or \"(B'nei) Yisrael\" (The Children of Israel). (Thanks @IsaacMoses, for bringing up @Menachem's excellent links. I'd like to reemphasize that those should really be checked out, especially the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/640221/jewish/What-is-the-Meaning-of-the-Name-Jew.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a> one on the origin of the term \"Jew\".)</p>\n\n<p>I'll use the word \"Jew\" hereinafter because it's convenient, but remember that I'm talking about the people, <em>not</em> the name.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, Avraham (Abraham) is considered to be the first of what we now call Jews.

But don't worry about them, they've got their own unique places in Jewish history. (Adam, the first man, the archetype of humanity. Noah, the only worthwhile guy in the universe at the time.) </p>\n\n<p><sub>*Noah's relative holiness is disputed by the rabbinic commentators. Some say he was only considered righteous compared to the rest of his (really evil) generation, while others say he was indeed righteous by any standard.

After the reign of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel split in two. The northern part contained most of the tribes and was thus called the Kingdom of Israel.

The citizens of this country were called יהודים, and their language was <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.18.26?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Tanakh&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">יהודית</a>.</p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Israel was exiled by the Assyrians, and more or less disappeared from history:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until Adonoy banished Yisroel from His Presence, as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets; and Yisroel went into exile from its land to Ashur until this day.

However we know there are other uses for the term such as from the gemarah (Megillah 13b) which discusses the merit accrued to Rachel, Shaul and Esther because of their tzniut; none of which  involve modesty in relation to clothing or sexuality. Similarly there is a stress on tzniut in the bathroom (brachos 62a/b) even when no one else is around. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a source for a <strong>conceptual</strong> definition of tzniut that would encompass all the various uses for the term?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>This would have to begin with Micah 6:8: והצנע לכת עם א-להיך, \"be tzanua in walking with your G-d\" (this is one of only two instances of this root in Tanach, the other being in Prov. 11:2, ואת צנועים חכמה).</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=49b&format=pdf\">Sukkah 49b</a> and Rashi there) explain this as referring to mitzvos done in public, like funerals and weddings; even these need to be done with tznius, \"and how much more so things that are supposed to be done in private\" (Rashi gives tzedakah as an example). Rashi explains \"tznius\" in either of two ways: (a) keeping one's emotions within appropriate bounds (e.g., not being over-mournful at a funeral, or giddy at a wedding); (b) not drawing attention to what one is spending.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that both of these come down to the same idea: keeping private what should be private. This would fit with what we find about the three personages mentioned in the Gemara you quoted: each of them knew how to keep a secret. It therefore also yields the common definition of tznius - keeping to oneself (and one's spouse) certain areas and aspects of one's body, behavior and emotions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The mishna in demai (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">6:6</a>) describes the \"tzanuey\" of Beis Hillel acting in accordance with the rule of Beis Shammai. The gemarah goes on to explain that the word can imply someone who is particularly vigilante or meticulous about the law. Similarly the term is found in Niddah 12a with the same implication.</p>\n\n<p>One can certainly \"be tznius\" ie conform to the letter of the law without <em>being tznius</em>, meaning without conforming to the spirit of the law. </p>\n\n<p>The only example of tznius Rashi quotes in the gemarah you cite is that Rachel kept the fact that she and Yaakov had signs private. This would be in keeping with the <a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2013/02/keeping-secrets/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rule</a> that if someone tells you something in confidence or private you are obligated to keep it as such. </p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question, I believe that tznius is understanding and complying with the implied intent of the law (to the best of your understanding). </p>\n\n\n",

Since the reasons may be connected, I will discuss both. To paraphrase <a href=\"http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-do-jews-sway-when-they-pray-some.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On the Mainline</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The first source is critical...The first source is a poem of <strong>Shemuel Ha-naggid</strong>. In this poem he is criticizing the degeneration of Torah study...As an example of their lack of orderliness he mentions their shokeling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה רב ותלמידים מנידים לראשיהם כערער בערבה</p>\n  \n  <p>The teacher and students were bobbing their head like a tamarisk in\n  the wilderness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This then is the first incidental mention of shokeling, at least in Jewish sources. Notice that it only mentions it in connection with studying.</p>\n\n<p>Next is the <strong>Kuzari</strong>, here it is, in Hartwig Hirschfeld's translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"79\">\n  <li><p>Al-Khazari: I should like to ask whether thou knowest the reason why Jews move to and fro when reading the Bible?</p></li>\n  <li><p>The Rabbi: It is said that it is done in order to arouse natural heat. My personal belief is that it stands in connection with the\n  subject under discussion. As it often happened that many persons read\n  at the same time, it was possible that ten or more read from one\n  volume. This is the reason why our books are so large. Each of them\n  was obliged to bend down in his turn in order to read a passage, and\n  to turn back again. This resulted in a continual bending and sitting\n  up, the book lying on the ground. This was one reason. Then it became\n  a habit through constant seeing, observing and imitating, which is in\n  man's nature.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that R. Yehuda Ha-levi too only discusses it in the context of studying, but doesn't mention praying. He gives two reasons. The first is one which people say, that it is to arouse heat in the body, I guess like a form of exercise. Alternatively, he means to arouse passion, to get into it. Then there is the reason preferred by the author, which is his suspicion that originally it was because people shared books and they moved in and our of the way so they could read and give others a chance to read and ultimately this became the habit and spread.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Zohar</strong> (Parashat Pinhas) gives the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We arose and went on our way, the sun becoming stronger and more\n  oppressive. We saw some trees in the wilderness with water underneath,\n  and we sat down in the shade of one of them. I asked him: How is it\n  that of all peoples of the world, only the Jews sway to and fro when\n  they study the Torah, a habit which seems to come natural to them, and\n  they are unable to keep still? He replied: You have reminded me of a\n  very deep idea which very few people know. He pondered for a moment\n  and wept. Then he continued: Alas for mankind who go about like cattle\n  without understanding. This thing alone is sufficient to distinguish\n  the holy souls of Israel from the souls of heathen peoples. The souls\n  of Israel have been hewn from the Holy Lamp, as is written, “The\n  spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord” (Prov. xx, 27). Now once this\n  lamp has been kindled from the supernal Torah, the light upon it never\n  ceases for an instant, like the flame of a wick which is never still\n  for an instant. So when an Israelite has said one word of the Torah, a\n  light is kindled and he cannot keep still but sways to and fro like\n  the flame of a wick. But the souls of heathens are like the burning of\n  stubble, which gives no flame, and therefore they keep still like wood\n  burning without a flame.’ Said R. Jose: ‘That is a good explanation;\n  happy am I to have heard this.’ (Soncino translation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/halacha-on-ou/swaying-prayer-torah-study/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the OU</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ba’al ha-turim</strong>, (Ex. 20:15), on the verse, “the people saw and trembled” comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על כן מתנענעים בשעת לימוד התורה לפי שהתורה ניתנה באימה ברתת ובזיע </p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore we sway during Torah learning, since the Torah was given with fear, terror, and shaking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Darchei Moshe</strong>, commenting on Tur, Hilchos Birchas ha-Shachar 48:1, cites <strong>Abudraham</strong>, “…the custom of Israel is to shake while they read (b’sha’a shekorin) just like when the Torah was given, it was given with terror…”  The phrase b’sha’a shekorin refers to the time the Torah is being read in the synagogue.  Rama, Shulchan Aruch ad loc. comments, “…the custom of those that are careful is to sway while the Torah is being read, comparable to the Torah that was given with terror.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer Hasidim</strong>, (57) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצריך לנענע כל גופו בשעת התפלה דכתיב כל עצמותי תאמרנה ה' מי כמוך (תהלים ל\"ה י') </p>\n  \n  <p>A person needs to shake his entire body during teffilah since the verse says \"All my bones shall say God who is like you (Psalms 35:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Shibolei HaLeket</strong>, (17) cites <strong>Ma’aseh Merkava</strong> as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצאתי במעשה המרכבה ובשעת התפלה צריך אדם לנענע כל גופו שנא' כל עצמותי תאמרנה ה' מי כמוך. </p>\n  \n  <p>I found in <em>Ma'aseh Merkava</em>: during prayer, a person needs to shake his entire body since the verse says \"All my bones shall say God who is like you (Psalms 35:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch, Mechaber, 95:3 states as follows, “[during Shemoneh Esrei one should] stand like a slave before his master with fear, awe, and dread (aimah, yirah, pachad).”  Mishnah Berurah 7, comments on this, “‘With fear’, and there are some that shake during teffilah based on the verse kol atzmosai tomarnah Hashem mi kamocha.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rivash</strong>, quoted by Mekor Chesed on Sefer Chasidim, ibid. gives a parable that when one is drowning and jumping around in the water, people won’t make fun of him.  So too, when one is davening and shaking himself, he is attempting to remove distractions.  “When a man is drowning in a river and making many movements to remove himself from the water, surely those that are watching him will not laugh at him and his [strange] movements; so too, when one prays (k’she’mispallel) and makes many [strange] movements, one should not laugh at him.”  This source seems to endorse animated  shukeling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R’ Schwab</strong> provides his own understanding of shukeling in R’ Schwab on Prayer (page 167):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are two ways in which a person can relate to Hakodosh Baruch Hu.\n  One is through ahava (love), in which a person feels very close to\n  Him, and the other is through yirah (awe), in which one is awestruck\n  by His Omnipotence and Omniscience.  This may explain the ancient\n  Jewish practice of “shokeling,” swaying forward and backward during\n  teffilah.  The forward motion expresses one’s desire to come close to\n  Hakodosh Baruch Hu, but then, upon reflection, one realizes that He is\n  the Ribbono Shel Olam, the Master of the universe, which causes one to\n  reel back in awe.  These thoughts are typically evoked during\n  meditation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ba’al Shem Tov</strong>, quoted by Mekor Chesed, ibid. states that one may shukel – but not during Shmoneh Esrei.  “Teffilah (i.e. Shmoneh Esrei) is like being paired with the Divine Presence…therefore, one must shake himself at the beginning [of prayer].  After this (i.e. during Shmoneh Esrei) one is able to stand without movement.  [This is because] he will be connected with the Divine Presence with a great connection.”</p>\n\n<p>Perush Azulai on Sefer Chasidim, ibid. says one should not shukel during Shmoneh Esrei.  “Rabbi and Kabbalist Yisroel Saruk and his student Ramah, may their memories be blessed, write that one should not shake his body during the recitation of Shmoneh Esrei since it (Shmoneh Esrei) is like standing before the King.”</p>\n\n<p>The most stringent source against shukeling during Shmoneh Esrei is Shlah (quote found in Nesiv Binah, vol. 1, pg. 96).  He emphatically states that not moving will give one more concentration.  He proves it by saying that nobody has ever gone to a king to ask for something while shaking – kal v’chomer before Hashem.  “Standing without any movement at all [during Shmoneh Esrei] will help one concentrate.  The verse that states kol atzmosai tomarnah (and is a source for shukeling) is only in reference to shiros, tishbachos, blessings on Shema, and during Torah learning – but not during Shmoneh Esrei.  If somebody should challenge you and say that one should also sway during Shmoneh Esrei, it would appear to me that such a person should be ignored.  Ones own experience will prove that standing without any movement at all during Shmoneh Esrei will cause ones heart to concentrate.  One should check it out himself: would a person ever ask requests from a human king while his body is swaying like the trees in the forest due to the wind?!”</p>\n\n<p>What is the practical law?</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Dr. Joseph Breuer zt”l, in an essay entitled “Our Way,” (A Unique Perspective, pg. 384) points out that it was a hallmark of German Jewry – and others – that they did not shukel during teffilah.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The same holds true for our posture during the Teffilah.  The Halacha is silent on the preference of a stationary versus a moving position in regard to the intensity of kavonoh during the Teffilah.  The sainted Ari Ha-kadosh, and with him many of our Torah Greats, assumed stationary positions during the Teffilah – and they were certainly not German Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Arukh Hashulhan</strong> (OH 48:3), and <strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> (48:5), come to the same conclusion – one may do whatever is desired.  Whatever allows one to concentrate better is the proper thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Arukh Hashulhan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובתפלת שמ\"ע יש מתנועעים ויש שאינם מתנועעים ותלוי לפי טבעו דאם בהתנועע הכונה יותר טוב אצלו נכון להתנועע ויש אדם שכונתו יותר ברורה כשעומד בשוה לגמרי לא יתנועע והכל לשם שמים: </p>\n  \n  <p>During Shemoneh Esrei, some sway and some do not.  This is contingent on one’s nature.  If one finds that they will concentrate better while shukeling then it is proper for that person to shukel.  There are those individuals that will have a clearer ability to concentrate while standing completely still – they should not shukel.  It is all proper as long as it is done for the Sake of Heaven.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishnah Berurah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש פוסקים שחולקין ע\"ז ואומרים דבתפלה אין להתנענע...וכתב המ\"א ודעביד כמר עביד ודעביד כמר עביד. והכל לפי מה שהוא אדם אם מכוין היטב ע\"י תנועה יתנענע וא\"ל יעמוד כך ובלבד שיכוין לבו</p>\n  \n  <p>There are those poskim that argue and say that during teffilah one should not shukel... Magen Avraham writes that one may choose either method.  It is all according to the individual – if one concentrates better by shukeling, let him shukel, and if not, let him stand [still] – as long as his heart is able to concentrate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I do it because this way it is more easy to concentrate on the words of the prayers.</p>\n\n\n",

The advantage of a tallit gadol is that it is for sure the correct size to be obligated in the mitzva.

He says that they represent alternative texts of the Bible which arose during the first Babylonian exile. When people were unable to determine the correct version of the text among the variants, they choose to keep both. (Reference: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42257&pgnum=1\">Introduction of Radak to Book of Yehoshua</a>, last few lines of the page). </li>\n<li>Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra almost exclusively finds value in the Kri and ignores the Ktiv. He considers the Kri to be the true intention of the text. He sees the Kri as an indication by the Masoretes of how to understand otherwise non-normative uses of Hebrew in the Ktiv.</li>\n<li>Abarbanel also prefers the Kri over the Ktiv. He offers two explanations for this phenomenon: 1) He suggests that Ezra and the sages (Anshei Knesset HaGdola) had Moshe's original Torah, but they found words that were difficult to understand, perhaps indicative of hidden meanings, etc. but added the Kri in order to provide a simple meaning to the text. 2) Regarding the phenomenon elsewhere in the Tanach, he considers them to be artifacts of the speakers and authors. For instance, Yechezkel wrote down his prophesies and recorded his speeches and his discussions with others, and the original ktiv reflects the natural but incomplete way in which people speak. The Kri are the amendments by Ezra to help the reader understand the original intention. (Reference: Introduction of Abarbanel to the Book of Yirmiyahu , <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14369&pgnum=299\">middle of left column</a> , also p. 295, left column...).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A number of modern researchers have proposed the following theories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The kri is a fix by the Masoretes to mistakes they found in the ktiv. (<a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&doc_number=001869299&local_base=NNL01\">Yehoshua Meir Grintz</a> p. 61, <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&doc_number=001854587&local_base=NNL01\">Gutholf Bergshterser</a> p. 29). This theory is problematic because the Masoretes did not see themselves as introducing independent changes, but rather simply preserving what was passed down. Also, it happens often enough that the ktiv is in fact more understandable than the kri (ex. Genesis 8:17). Finally, word A sometimes appears as a ktiv for word B, and in another passage word B can appear as a ktiv for word B. (ex. Exodus 16:2, Numbers 14:36).</li>\n<li>The kri and ktiv are based on different versions of the text that was passed down and then checked against one another. (H. M. Orlinsky, The Origin of the Kethid-Qere System: A New Approach, VTS 7, 1960, p. 184-192) It seems unlikely though that there were exactly only two textual variants for a given kri u'ktiv.</li>\n<li>A compromise position which says that kri u'ktiv originally served as a way of making slight additions, like for using more euphemistic language when deemed necessary (e.g. yishagelna/yishkavna). Later, kri u'ktiv was expanded to include textual variants. According to this theory, the three texts of the Torah used in the Beit HaMikdash (Masechet Sofrim 6:4, Yerushalmi Taanit 4:2, Avot D'Rabbi Natan 46, Sifrei Dvarim 33:27 356) were considered as the original source texts and differences between these three were noted in the kri u'ktiv. (R. Gordis, The Biblical Text in the Making: a Study of Kethid-Qere, Philadelphia, 1971, p. 465, 456) The difficulty in this position is that the Masoretes had to make lots of decisions when writing their codices -- why would they suddenly choose to maintain record these differences, while all other aspects they simply decided without leaving any relevant footnotes, references, etc.</li>\n<li>Another suggestion is that the Ktiv reflects the written tradition, but the Kri represents a separate oral tradition which was passed down through the generations in parallel. (<a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&doc_number=002372077&local_base=NNL01\">Broyer</a> p. 9; <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&doc_number=001876408&local_base=NNL01\">S Levin</a>) The difficulty with this suggestion is explaining how the oral tradition ever diverged from the written tradition in the first place.</li>\n<li>Aharon ben Asher, the Masorete who authored the Keter codex (considered the most reliable ever made), states, 'One does not contradict the other, but rather they are complementary.' (<a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&doc_number=001845880&local_base=NNL01\">Sefer Dikdukei HaTaamim LeRabbi Aharon ben Moshe ben Asher</a>, page 9). A modern author who bases his analysis on this theory is <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&doc_number=002696306&local_base=NNL01\">Maimon Kohen</a>. His basic thesis is that they reflect variations of dialect, morphology, phonology... which existed in the Hebrew language at the time. The Ktiv might have one version, and the Kri will serve as an alternative form. The kri and ktiv texts mean the same thing, they're simply reflective of the unsettled nature of Biblical Hebrew with its many variant declensions, local dialects, etc. Most of this answer is based on his book -- I find it highly informative and recommend it strongly to anyone with an interest in Biblical Hebrew (albeit very technical in the areas of grammar and phonology).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there a halachik source that contains a full list of all kri/ktiv\n  pairing in all of tanach?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. The number instances of kri u'ktiv simply depends on which codex of the Bible you're referring to. The codex with the smallest number has about 800, while the codex with the largest has about 1,500. The differences between the occurrences in the codices come down to differences in the methodologies by which the different Masoretes worked.

The midrash was critical that Esav was tzayid b'fiv- he trapped with his mouth.  The trapping was done kilachar yad, in an unusual way.  This was a violation of שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים תַּעֲבֹד וְעָשִׂיתָ כָּל-מְלַאכְתֶּךָ.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes, the <em>avos</em> kept <em>shabas</em> all week long, but the <em>imahos</em> did not. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In <em>B'reshis</em> 14:22, <em>Avraham</em> refuses to take money, telling the king of <em>S'dom</em> to keep it for himself and give it to others. Of course, this was because <em>Avraham</em> couldn't take money on <em>shabas</em> (i.e, every day).</li>\n<li>In chapter 18, <em>Avraham</em> brings food to his visitors, but only <em>Sara</em> and \"the young man\" prepare it.</li>\n<li>In 27:9, <em>Rivka</em> tells <em>Yaakov</em> to bring goats, but offers to prepare them, herself, for eating.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While you can ask how <em>Avraham</em> cut animals in half (15:10), this was presumably on a direct command (not stated in the <em>pasuk</em>) from <em>Hashem</em>, which of course overrides a general <em>mitzva</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And his \"repaying his credit\" (<em>Rashi</em> to 13:3) was done not with money but with services, which can be done on <em>shabas</em>: he was a <em>magid</em>, an itinerant preacher, who of course can work on <em>shabas</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You may ask about <em>Yitzchak</em>'s digging wells in 26:18, 22. But we see in verses 19 and 21 that his servants did the digging. The two interior <em>p'sukim</em> specifying it was his servants surrounded by the two saying \"<em>Yitzchak</em>\" serve as a <em>k'lal ufrat uchlal, i ata dan ela k'en hap'rat</em>, so we see that all the wells were dug by people affiliated with <em>Yitzchak</em>. None, however, were actually dug by him: what do you take him for, a <em>m'chalal shabas, chas v'shalom</em>?</p>\n\n\n",

This is based on the Shach in Yoreh Deah 91 (#3), as well as the discussion in the Aruch HaShulchan in Yoreh Deah 91:6, where it is clear that one may use cold, non-kosher utensils to eat kosher food, as long as it is done only occasionally.</p>\n\n<p>Since nothing is hot, the question of ben yomo or eino ben yomo (whether it was used in the last 24 hours) does not even matter. And as long as you are just eating the fish, then the issue of charif does not matter either. (If however, a non-kosher knife was used to cut a charif food, like an onion, then you could not eat the onion. But if it subsequently cut fish, then the fish is still fine, because fish is not considered a davar charif). </p>\n\n<p>So the bottom line is that the only issue is whether the fish is kosher and cold and the knife is clean. If all you are eating is the raw fish, then there are no issues of charif or kli ben yomo.</p>\n\n<p>(For more on the topic of identifying skinless salmon or other salmanoid fish  based on its distinctive red color, see: <a href=\"http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/the_kashrus_of_skinless_salmon1/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/the_kashrus_of_skinless_salmon1/</a> .

If the knife cuts an onion, and before cleaning off the knife cuts squid or cooked eel, or a number of other unkosher foods found at a place that serves Sashimi, or more likely, even cuts them at the same time, the knife is no longer kosher.  In a restaurant that serves sashimi there is a good chance that Wasabi, Soy Sauce, Radish, Rice wine Vinegar, Ginger, or many other vegetables, all of which count as \"hot\" will have treifed up the knife less than 24 hours before your sashimi was cut.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard of people who have their own knife which they have given to a sushi chef in places where kosher agencies are not around.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  I see the need to quote a <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-SharpAwareness.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">source here so</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Furthermore, davar charif is not limited to imparting tastes into\n  food; it can also impart a taste into a utensil.

Similarly, Rav Shlomo Kluger[18]\n  writes that if an onion was cut with a fleishig knife on top of a\n  milchig plate, both the onion and the knife will absorb a combination\n  of meat and milk tastes, thus rendering them both non-kosher.[19]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Given the hatred of the Amei Haaretz for the Torah scholars, wouldn't it have been better to be around them to teach them the beauty of the Torah, rather than avoiding them altogether?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>On a practical (halachic) level, there was the consideration that amei haaretz (or at least a significant minority of them) were known to be careless about separating maaser from their produce (most of Maseches Demai deals with the ramifications of this), and about the laws of tum'ah and taharah (which, in fairness to them, can be pretty complex).</p>\n\n<p>So just to be a ne'eman (someone who can be trusted about maaser) already meant a degree of social separation from the amei haaretz - specifically, not being a guest in his house. To be a chaver (someone who can be trusted about tum'ah and taharah as well; this term is also often used for Torah scholars) required still more: restrictions on what kind of produce he could buy from an am haaretz or sell to him, and not having an am haaretz as a guest in his house unless he'd change his clothing first (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99_%D7%91_%D7%91\">Demai 2:2</a>-3) - the clothing of an am haaretz is a source of tum'ah (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%97%D7%92%D7%99%D7%92%D7%94_%D7%91_%D7%96\">Chagigah 2:7</a>); the wife of a chaver would have to keep away from her am haaretz friend when it came to kneading dough (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%94_%D7%98\">Sheviis 5:9</a>/<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%92%D7%99%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%94_%D7%98\">Gittin 5:9</a>); and there were other complex rules when it came to having an am haaretz in your house, about what might or might not have become tamei (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%98%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%96\">Taharos chs. 7</a>-8).</p>\n\n<p>So that alone must have fueled some of the resentment of the amei haaretz towards the Torah scholars - but these halachos could not be compromised if the talmidei chachamim were to preserve their tahor status. (Which is why this isn't an issue today, when we are all tamei anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>We do find some cases where they worked with individual amei haaretz or small groups of them. One example is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=37&format=pdf\">R. Zeira in Sanhedrin 37a</a> doing \"kiruv\" with his local gang of toughs, where the upshot was that after his death they finally did teshuvah. But after all, that could be taken either way! You could argue that his work with them planted seeds that finally bore fruit, but you could equally well argue that it was their fear of complete ostracism by the rabbis that induced them to do teshuvah (\"until now we had [R. Zeira] to pray for us, but now, who will do so?\"), and thus that his attempts were counterproductive and delayed their teshuvah. (I heard this explanation in a shiur; I don't know the source.)</p>\n\n<p>So it may be that the difference has something to do with the relative positions of the Torah scholars and the amei haaretz in society. As long as the former were generally accepted as the elite and the establishment, then it may indeed have been more likely that the amei haaretz would seek them out and try to improve themselves for this purpose; nowadays, when this situation no longer obtains, there is really no choice but to get ourselves involved and try in whatever ways we can to upgrade their knowledge and observance of Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

Leaving aside if someone else were to see the jewish person using this new situation (for this question, the person is living in an apartment, so nobody can look in and see what he's doing in his bedroom or living room), are there any halachic ramifications for benefiting from the new situation?

Moshe de Leon, R. Yosef Gikitilla and R. Bachya b. Asher. The description “Pardes” for this fourfold interpretation belongs to R. Moshe de Leon, in a lost work of that name, and became widely known through the Tikkunei Zohar.</p>\n<p>See also M. Idel, “Pardes: The Fourfold Method of Interpretation” (Appendix I) in <em>Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and Interpretations</em> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2002), pp. 429-37. Idel argues that the tiered “Pardes” hermeneutic allowed Kabbalists to locate kabbalistic interpretation in “a place of honor” without replacing existing methods of exegesis. According to late thirteenth century kabbalists, the “four who entered Pardes” each reached one level of PaRDeS. Likewise, Pardes was seen to correspond to four worlds of ‘atzilut, beriah, yetsirah and ‘asiyah. The kabbalist climbs successively through these worlds by means of the pardes method.</p>\n<p>B. Sack, The Kabbalah of R. Moshe Cordovero [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1995) pp. 113-139, discusses the view of R.

As for the term \"slaughtered\" (שחיטה), he compares it to the phrase וישחטם במדבר in Num. 14:16 - the Jews who died in the desert didn't have their throats cut, they simply died a natural death.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l (in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15903&pgnum=192\">Likkutei Sichos, vol. 31, pp. 180</a>ff) builds further on this, citing another statement from Shaloh (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14406&pgnum=122\">Shaar HaOsiyos</a>) that with Torah scholars, drinking wine can go hand in hand with the revelation of deep Torah secrets. This, then, he says, is what happened with Rabbah and R. Zeira: they did indeed drink wine at their Purim feast, but more to the point is that Rabbah (whose very name - which literally means \"great\" - signifies his greater capacities) brought R. Zeira (\"small\") to such a level of ecstasy that his soul left him. (The Rebbe compares this to the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, which on the one hand is associated with their having drunk wine (Rashi to Lev. 10:2) and on the other hand is viewed as a sign of their greatness (Rashi ibid. v. 3, and Ohr Hachaim ibid. 16:1).</p>\n\n<p>He then goes on to say that this is hinted at by the term שחיטה, for אין ושחט אלא ומשך (Chullin 30b) - shechitah means to \"draw out\" and elevate.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/salt-shemot/21-10kitisa.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' David Silverberg discusses some non-literal interpretations</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Maharsha explains that Rava urged Rabbi Zeira to drink during the Purim festivities, to the point where Rabbi Zeira took seriously ill.  Rava then prayed on his colleague's behalf and Rabbi Zeira recovered from his intoxication.  According to this reading, the Gemara relates this story in order to emphasize the dangers of excessive drinking, and warns against encouraging others to drink beyond their tolerance levels.</p>\n<p>Rav Yaakov Emden explains differently, claiming that Rava pretended to kill Rabbi Zeira in order to restore a degree of solemnity to what had become a scene of frivolous merrymaking, rather than a true expression of gratitude to God.... Rabbi Zeira, who was unaware of Rava's intentions, was terror-stricken and fainted.  Rava thus had to pray for Rabbi Zeira's recovery, which the Gemara describes as his revival from death....</p>\n<p>Rav Yitzchak Hutner, in his Pachad Yitzchak (Purim, 32), suggests interpreting the Gemara's reference to Rabbi Zeira's \"death\" as a metaphoric description of the transformational experience he underwent over the course of his Purim observance.  Chazal famously describe Purim as a day of kabbalat ha-Torah, when we celebrate the Jewish people's reacceptance of the Torah even under the trying conditions of exile....  Chazal comment that when Benei Yisrael accepted the Torah at Mount Sinai, their souls departed and had to be restored to their bodies.  Rav Hutner understood this image as expressing the transformational element of kabbalat ha-Torah, the notion that committing oneself to Torah means fundamentally changing one's character, lifestyle and outlook.  In a similar vein, Rabbi Zeira experienced kabbalat ha-Torah so fully and genuinely that he could be said to have been \"killed\" as a result of this profound experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(For example, R' Moshe Feinstein held that an Amah is around 54cm.)</p>\n\n<p>What is the source of these two opinions?

If you establish this value to calculate the practical Torah measurements that you come upon [including] the size of the lechi of your city's eruv, there is no doubt that you have discharged your obligation, for you will have done that which is incumbent on you in Torah law. There is also no doubt, in my humble opinion, that you should not be surprised if other Rabbis elsewhere will not [have the same value as] yours, with one rather being less and another greater than your measurement.\nFor to my limited knowledge, it is totally impossible to definitively establish a single universal value for the measurements of the Torah's laws, and the Blessed Giver of our Torah did not have this in mind at all. Are not all the Torah's measurements in essence the dimensions of fruits and parts of the body (olive, pomegranate, barley-corn, kotevet, egg, fingerbreadth, handbreadth, cubit, etc.), and is it not so that the size of fruits and the stature of people, on which these measurements are based, <strong>differ in every place and generation? So perforce there will be varying values for the measurements of the Torah</strong>. In my humble opinion this does not reduce the truth of the Torah but rather increases it, for <strong>the goal of all of the Torah's laws is only to orient human affairs</strong>. The basis for all their measurements as given to us is, in my humble opinion, בערך מה אל ענין א' מעניני בני אדם. For example, in my humble opinion it is quite likely that the measurement given for the height of a mehitzah, whose purpose is to delineate human domains, will be larger or smaller according to the the height of the average person in a given time and place. I cannot elaborate, and anyway there is no need for an understanding person such as yourself. Also, even in a single time and place, fruits and people are not identical in size, and it is all but impossible that all who measure will find precisely the same average.

We only have passing mentions of the plagues with no elaboration or additional midrashic material offered.</p>\n\n<p>This stands in contrast to other holidays such as chanukah or purim where the focus is on the miraculous nature of divine salvation. Furthermore it seems to undermine the nature of the chag as a conduit from one generation to the next (v'higadeta l'bincha).

Any objective observer who is not ridden by certain feelings  can recognize that the Holocaust is a unique event, which never happened before, and has not happened since.

It implies that pure randomness dictates which ticket will win, therefore the more tickets you buy the better your chances of winning. A person with proper <em>emunah</em> (faith) understands that G-d is in control of everything, even what seems apparently random, and while you can't win the lottery without a ticket you only need to have one for Him to make you the winner.</p>\n\n<p>But how does <em>hashkafa</em> view the act of <strong>buying the lottery ticket</strong>? There are <em>any number</em> of normal, non-miraculous ways for a person to become rich. If G-d wants to bestow riches on you He is not constrained in how to do it. Is it presumptuous to buy a lottery ticket, implying He couldn't make you rich some other way?</p>\n\n<p>Please give sources for your answers, read or taught, from Jewish <em>hashkafa</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Your question asks if buying a lottery ticket is some form of questioning Gd's ability to help you through \"normal\" means.   This would imply that you believe that buying a lottery ticket is NOT a normal means of acquiring money.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to question that assumption.  It is true, that most people do not win money from the lottery. And that would make this an \"abnormal\" way of acquiring money from the perspective of the average population.   However, from the perspective of faith in Gd, a lottery is really no different than praying to find lots of money from some other means.</p>\n\n<p>You can pray to Gd all day that he allows you to find a hidden treasure. However, if you don't leave your house and search for that treasure you will never find it.   This is true for all forms of gaining money.  If you pray to Gd to give you a good business prospect, you must then go out and conduct business, else you will not receive that reward.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, your question here could easily be, \"Is searching for gifts or treasures, a  a lack of faith?\", or somebody else might ask, \"Is working for a living, a lack of faith?\"   Any one of the numerous ways to gain money could be singled out, as different from the other ways of making money, and thus would be open to the question if the activity is a lack of faith.   In the end, all action which normally produces money is a question of lack of faith.   </p>\n\n<p>There are two resolutions to this problem:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You argue that since the other actions are not a lack of faith, then buying a lottery ticket is also no a lack of faith.</li>\n<li>Every action appears to be a lack of faith, and we ask what is the proper action.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Jewish tradition takes route 2 and asks in many different ways, what is needed from a person to act and what will be the method of receiving a reward.</p>\n\n<p>In general, we follow the dictum that if we make the opening of a needle, then Gd will create an opening for us large enough to drive a camel through it.   This phrase originally appears within the context of Teshuvah, but has been used throughout the generations as a general way of understanding Gd's working in this world.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a blessing of money, you need to open up needle eyes.  Buying a lottery ticket is one of many ways of doing that.   However, on the other side of the spectrum, we are told that the greater the effort, the greater the reward. And in that vein, since buying a lottery  ticket requires little effort, one can expect little reward, unless the need is truly great.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have heard in the name of Rav Moshe Feinstein that it is good for someone with a fixed salary to buy an occasional lottery ticket - but only one - in order to recognize that his livelihood is not actually dependent on his employer and that divine providence guides his income.</p>\n\n<p>This is kind of quoted <a href=\"http://halachafortodaycom.blogspot.com/2012/04/q-page-8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> without a direct source:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein Zatzal ruled that to buy a lottery ticket is Hishtadlus; to buy more than one is a lack of Bitachon, as if you were meant to win, your odds won’t improve by purchasing more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It then goes on to say that purchasers of lotteries that benefit charity can purchase more than one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer, zt'l, Founder and Rosh HaYeshiva of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington, and the Rav of Young Israel Shomrai Emunah, said that if one buys only a single raffle ticket, then that is fine.  If God wants the purchaser to win, he will win -- but only if he buys a ticket.  However, purchasing more than one ticket for a single drawing indicates that the buyer believes that buying more tickets increases his chances of winning.  In other words, he believes in the odds more than he believes in God.  And given the odds involved in lottery winnings, relying on the odds indicates the buyer is an \"idiot.\"  I asked him if he heard that from a teacher, and he said \"no,\" he came up with that himself.</p>\n\n\n",

Apparently, according to this view, what sets 'Amalek aside for destruction is not genetics per se, and not even necessarily a desire to destroy the Jewish People, but something far more fundamental; it's their rejection of HaShem and refusal to follow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah\" rel=\"nofollow\">the 7 Noahide laws</a> that makes them our mortal enemy. After all, remember our first encounter with them. We were weary and, at least according to one view, 'Amalek tried to take advantage of our weakness (physical and/or spiritual) to wage war with us, which indicated their fear more of our military might (then weakened) than our protection provided by HaShem, and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2283/jewish/Amalek.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">a general disdain for our G-d</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When did Achashverosh stop rounding up fair maidens?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So first Achashverosh was married to Vashti. Then no more Vashti. Then he's rounding up all the fair maidens in the land to um, \"meet\" them, one per night, but they're still stuck in one of his royal properties afterwards. </p>\n\n<p>Then he finally meets Esther and declares her queen. Then the Megillah says \"when the maidens were rounded up a second time\" ...</p>\n\n<p>So at what point (if ever?) did Achashverosh stop rounding up fair maidens?</p>\n\n<p>So the practice started because \"oh he's so lonely and he needs a new queen\", but then it never stopped?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=13&format=pdf\">Megillah 13a</a>, bottom), cited by Rashi to the verse in Esther, says that this was Achashverosh's last-ditch attempt to get Esther to reveal her origins, since otherwise she might be replaced as queen.</p>\n\n<p>(It says that this was done at Mordechai's advice; thus the juxtaposition that \"Mordechai was sitting at the king's gate.\" Me'am Loez adds - I don't recall his source - that Mordechai actually had a reason of his own for this suggestion: to see whether indeed Esther's selection as queen had been ordained by Hashem - in which case Achashverosh would end up finding no one better - or not.)</p>\n\n<p>R. Eliezer Ashkenazi (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44484&st=&pgnum=62\">Yosef Lekach</a>), on the other hand, explains the other way around: now that Achashverosh had found his queen, he was ready to send all of the other candidates home. Since they were in different places in the palace complex or in the kingdom - some were with the agents who had been sent to look for them, others were already under the control of the officials mentioned in 2:3 (ויפקד המלך פקידים), still others in the first or second harem - this can be described as \"rounding them up.\" (The point, R. Ashkenazi goes on to say, is that even now that she was confirmed as queen and there was no reason for her to fear reprisals against her family or nation for her having tried to evade being chosen, she still continued to obey Mordechai's orders and keep her secret.)</p>\n\n<p>Maharal (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14191&pgnum=35\">Ohr Chodosh</a>) seems to say that indeed it was a regular occurrence: the women were brought to the harem in groups (and then each one had her night with the king), and this was the arrival of the next group after Esther had been crowned as queen; Achashverosh might well have selected some of them as concubines. (Maharal therefore explains the relevance of the statement that \"Mordechai was sitting at the king's gate\" almost exactly the opposite of the Gemara's explanation: he wanted to keep encouraging her not to be afraid that she'd be replaced, but to keep her secret.)</p>\n\n<p>R. Yaakov of Lissa (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24311&pgnum=16\">Megillas Sesarim</a>) explains that Achashverosh didn't want to be intimate with Esther. First of all, since she wasn't telling her lineage, any children he'd have with her might be of ignoble origin; second, if she became pregnant she might lose her beautiful looks. So he had more girls brought to become his wives and concubines, but kept Esther as queen because of her beauty; she liked this arrangement - not being forced to have relations with Achashverosh - and therefore kept from him the information about her lineage that might have made him desire her more.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The second time was to try and call Esther's bluff.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/in-depth/plainBody.asp?AID=2823#Esther02_19\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And when the virgins were gathered a second time... (2:19)</strong></p>\n<p>With the great honors bestowed upon her on the one hand, and by threatening her position by gathering maidens for a second time on the other, the king hoped to persuade Esther to reveal her origin. But with the help of Mordechai who \"was sitting at the king's gate\" to encourage her, she did not give in.</p>\n<p>(Rashi; Talmud, Megillah 13a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A prince, Shalom, enters through a cave, but a scoundrel named Zifa takes the credit (Shalom didn't know about the king or princess). Shalom and Shlomit meet in the garden and fall in love, but she's now technically engaged to Zifa, until it's revealed that Shalom was actually the one who found a way into the tower.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/44188\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LaYesharim Tehillah</a> (1743) - A morality play about good and evil where all of the characters are personified virtues/vices (intellect, arrogance, patience, etc.). Honesty [Yosher], the son of Truth [Emet] was matched to marry Glory [Tehillah], but she's taken to wed Arrogance [Rahav] after the Confusion army storms the city. With the help of Justice and Intellect, all is cleared up and Honesty and Glory marry.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There's hardly any rabbinic discussion about these works, mostly because they were not well-known or publicized in religious communities (his first play was only published two centuries after he wrote it). That said, there's nothing controversial about them. Even the fairy tale about love is obviously a kabbalistic allegory filled with mystical components (e.g., the cave, the garden, a tower called <em>Ayin</em>). In the introduction to <em>Migdal Oz</em>, the Ramchal writes that the beautiful princess is really the Torah, hidden away until she is revealed and known. These works had a far greater impact on the development of modern Hebrew writing, as the Ramchal's poetry and poetic plays are generally considered the beginning of the modern era of creative Hebrew literature.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Please check the site of <a href=\"https://www.ramhal.com/%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%97-%D7%9C.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machon haRamchal</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ramhal.com/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%2D%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%97%2D%D7%9C.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Specifically the plays available</a>:</p>\n<p>לישרים תחילה</p>\n<p>מִגְדַּל עֹז</p>\n<p>מעשה שמשון</p>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, I cannot find a photo at the moment.  It is a (generally laminated,) white poster with black lettering, with the words for Modim DeRabanan on it.  It tends to be placed on the wall of the Shul as an aid to the casual person who, like many of us, put down or closed his or her Siddur during Hazarath HaShatz and is unprepared to read Modim when the Hazan gets up to that point, and needs to read it inside due to a lack of memorization of the Modim DeRabanan or for greater ease in remembering (and therefore concentrating on) it.</p>\n\n<p>However, virtually every version of this poster I have seen uses the exact same text (and font, spacing, etc.; in other words, they're all prints of the same original), and the text uses the word UThHonnenu (and favor us), in the line after we have expressed praise for G-d for \"Having let us live and having sustained us\", in the line that asks for this to continue, \"So may You (G-d) allow us to live <em>and favor us</em>...\"  But this is inconsistent with the previous praise.  We have praised HaShem for <em>sustaining us</em>.  Not only that, but in virtually every (Nusah Ashkenaz) Siddur I've ever seen, the text <em>is consistent</em> with the preceding line of praise!

Can someone explain this in simple terms, preferably with an older source (i.e. Talmud, Rambam, Shulchan Aruch), and not only a modern day citation?</p>\n\n<p>For example: can I make a <em>neder</em> that I will go to work tomorrow, or would that be automatically considered a shevua?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=16&daf=3&format=pdf\">Nedarim 2b</a>) says explicitly what the difference is between a neder and a shevuah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתנא נדרים דמיתסר חפצא עליה... לאפוקי שבועה דקאסר נפשיה מן חפצא<br>\n  It taught nedarim where one forbids an object on himself, and excluded shevuot where one forbids one's self from the object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This distinction follows through to the Rambam (first two halachot in each of hilchot <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/6201.htm\">nedarim</a> and <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/6101.htm\">shevuot</a>). According to him, shevuot are things you declare about yourself, either as past tense declaratives, or future tense promises. Nedarim are either forbidding the benefit of some object, or declaring it's dedication to something like the Temple treasury thereby also forbidding its benefit to you and obligating you to bring it to its new 'owner'.</p>\n\n<p>If you make a neder to go to work tomorrow, I don't know if it automatically converts into a shevuah, but it certainly is not a neder.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=6&hilchos=31&perek=3&halocha=7&hilite=\">Hil. Nedarim 3:7</a>) draws exactly this distinction, based on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=16&daf=16b&format=pdf\">Nedarim 16b</a>. He says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומפני מה נדרים חלים על דברי מצוה. ושבועות אין חלות על דברי מצוה. שהנשבע אוסר עצמו על דבר שנשבע עליו. והנודר אוסר הדבר הנדור על עצמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/973882/jewish/Chapter-3.htm\">Chabad.org</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why do vows take effect with regard to mitzvot and oaths do not take effect with regard to mitzvot? Because when a person takes an oath he forbids himself from [partaking of] the entity mentioned in the oath. When, by contrast, one takes a vow, he causes the entity mentioned in the vow to be forbidden to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The footnotes there say that this is precisely a gavra vs. cheftza distinction.</p>\n\n<p>In that same chapter, Rambam gives other practical differences between them. For example, matpis (saying \"Y is like X\") works only for nedarim, because you've declared X to be forbidden and therefore can make Y exactly like it, while that doesn't work for shevuos.</p>\n\n<p>Saying that \"I will do something\" which is permissible - as in your example of \"I will go to work\" - is indeed a shevuah. A neder, by definition, is either declaring something to be forbidden to oneself, or taking on an obligation to bring a korban or give tzedakah (Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=6&hilchos=31&hilite=\">ibid. 1:1</a>-2 and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=7&hilchos=35&perek=8&hilite=\">Matnos Aniyim 8:1</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems that if you take a neder to go to work that it would not do anything. \nThe לשון would probably be ’’הרי עלי להלוך לעבודה’’, which makes no sense, because there is no object on which the neder can be חל. However, if you said one of the following: a)הרי עלי שבועה שאלך לעבודה or b) הרי הליכה לעבודה על  רגלי קונם or קונם רגלי בהליכה the neder would be חל,for the following reasons: a) it is a נדר בלשון שבועה, which may work (see the frist ר’’ן in נדרים) and b) the issur (קונם) is mentioned specifically on a physical object, i.e. your feet.</p>\n\n\n",

I was eating with Jewish, non-observant friends.  I brought over a hamburger from a local kosher take-out place.  They had homemade, non-kosher food, and they also ate bread.  </p>\n\n<p>If it makes a difference, the bread that they ate was not kosher supervised, but likely did not contain any specific treif ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>If it makes a difference, I washed and said \"hamotzi\", they did not.</p>\n\n<p>After we finished eating, I started saying the Bircat Hamazon.  They realized what I was doing, and, having attended Reform summer camps, asked me to slow down and sing it out loud, so they could join in!  (After the first paragraph, they did not continue).</p>\n\n<p>This led me to wonder:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>can / should one who ate treif food say the bircat hamazon afterwards?</p></li>\n<li><p>can / should one who are treif food be counted in a zimun?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>(Based on Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&st=&pgnum=183\">OC 196</a> with Mishna Berura)</p>\n\n<p>One who ate non kosher food when not permitted to do so (ie not in a case of danger to life) should not say a bracha before or after eating and does not combine to form a zimmun. The Mishna Berura adds that some achronim hold that if it was eaten beshogeg (accidentally) then one could say a after bracha but not combine to a zimmun. This assumes the food is forbidden even rabbinically. In your case this would depend on how you categorize the actions of non religious Jews.</p>\n\n<p>He notes a further case where the different people at the meal will not partake of the other persons food because of a chumra (such as one who keeps pas yisrael with one who does not) or because of different statuses (such as a yisrael eating with a kohein who is eating his terumah), in this case as long as everyone can partake of at least one person's food, they do combine.</p>\n\n<p>So if you wouldn't eat their rolls as a chumra and they would eat yours, then you do combine, but if you wouldn't eat their rolls midina (by law) then you would then have to hold that they don't combine with you, although they may have to bentch by themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I note that if you think they are obligated to bentch (depending, as above) then even if there was no combining for zimmun you might want to bentch out loud so that they can be yotzei by hearing you. The Shulchan Aruch rules (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&st=&pgnum=177\">OC 193:1</a>) that even in a case without zimmun (ie only two people) then one should still motzi the other if the other is not knowledgeable in the text of bentching. (The Mishna Berura there notes that many hold this is true even if the listener doesn't understand Hebrew.) Obviously, this should only be done if it will not cause strife and dislike between you and the others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If the food is probably kosher, but just doesn't have kosher certification, then that's not a problem and should not affect these halachos in any way. </p>\n\n<p>If it was actually treif, then one should not say birchas hamazon on it (and obviously there's no zimmun). The gemara in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%95_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">sanhedrin</a> discusses saying a bracha on stolen food and quotes the passuk \"בוצע ברך נאץ ה'\" to say that such a bracha can be considered almost blasphemous. While there is some discussion about how to apply these halachos, I think most would agree that if the food is actually treif, it would be completely wrong to say a bracha on it. This is even worse than stolen food, where the food itself is not a problem, just the means of getting it. How can one say a blessing to God while eating what He forbids? </p>\n\n\n",

There are a lot of problems with this. No one ever suggested this as an explanation of that passage before. There is no reason to think Zakhar has exceptions if we've never seen one before.

    "content": "# How was the Shaalos Utshuvos Min Hashamayim allowed to do what he did?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%22%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shut Min Hashamayim</a> was written by a Rishon in the time of Tosfos. He used to ask questions from Shamayim (Heaven) in a Sheilas Chalom (Dream Question) and write the answers down. Many of those questions are practical Halachic questions (for example, is the correct Tfillin Rashi or Rabbeinu Tam, etc).</p>\n<p>How is this not a violation of <em>Lo Bashamayim Hi</em> (Torah is not in Heaven; cf. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9994#v=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 30:12</a>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=49b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 49b</a>), the concept that halachic rulings can only be based on the halachic process, and never on pure divine inspiration?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This question is the subject of a teshuva of Rav Ovadia Yosef in Yabia Omer 1:41-42, and he returns to this subject in many later teshuvos as well. He writes regarding this question that דבר זה הוא מקצוע גדול בתורה (so imagine this question upvoted by R. Ovadia Yosef). </p>\n\n<p>First of all, it isn't so clear that we actually do 'pasken' like the Shut min Hashamayim, though the Chida seemed to have insisted upon it. Second, isn't a bas kol or prophecy - it's a dream. Rav Ovadia writes </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש חילוק גדול בין מתנבא בשם ה' דרך נבואה, דבהא הוא דאמרינן שאין נביא רשאי לחדש דבר מעתה, לחולם חלום, שאינו אלא אחד מששים בנבואה (ברכות נז:), ומש\"ה אין איסור זה נוהג בחלום, שאינו תוקע עצמו לדבר הלכה, להכריח להאמין בו כנבואה, אלא כגילוי מילתא בעלמא, וכל מי שאינו רוצה לסמוך עליו הרשות בידו, ולא הוי כמוותר על דברי נביא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A dream is only 'one sixtieth of prophecy', and so one is not forced to believe that they are true. He continues to quote from the Shita Mekubetzes to Bava Metzia: ברי חלומות הם, שהם קרובים לנבואה, אבל [לא] יסמכו בזה הענין, והחלומות שוא ידברו - dreams can be semi-prophetic, but they can also just be nonsense, and so a person makes a decision whether or not to follow the directive/halakha of the dream or not. Therefore, the teshuvos in Min Hashamayim aren't meant as clear revelations from Heaven, but as decisions made by the author to believe that his dreams were correct. This is also why other poskim felt perfectly comfortable arguing with the Shut Min Hashamayim if they felt that he was wrong. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I do not know what it says in the introduction of that book, however I would imagine that his explanation would go something like this.</p>\n\n<p>The story of \"Lo Bashamyim hi\", exists in a very specific context. That context is a Beit Din arguing with one of the members of that Beit Din.  That is, we have a situation, where a beit din is gathered, and they are making a ruling.  In those contexts, the Shechinah is said to have descended upon the group.  The Majority of that Beit Din are then given the authority to make a ruling, and Bat Kols are not a valid form of testimony to the beit Din.</p>\n\n<p>However, the concept of \"Lo Bashamayim hi\", does not necessarily apply in a situation where there is no beit din, or there is no sanctioned method of testimony.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous examples in the Talmud, where a halacha is learned or passed down by eliyahu to a single individual, or through other form of knowledge gained from \"the heavens\".  Never in any of those situations, do we argue \"lo Bashamayim hi\".  The only time that argument is really made, or has any valdity is in a situation of a beit din, or a gathering and a strict vote, which is gathered from numerous talmid chachamim \"sitting together\" to discuss and come to a conclusion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are several Rishonim (collected in Encycolpedia Talmudis, but for example see the Raavid's comment on the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=20211&rid=2416\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Shofar Lulav V'Sukka 8:5</a> where he explicitly argues for his position because of Ruach HaKodesh - although he justifies it intellectually - see at the link the argument if the Raavid means it literally) that hold that the final Halacha is <strong>not</strong> like Rabbi Yehoshua, and in fact you can pasken from a Bas Kol.</p>\n\n<p>After all, we see the argument between Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel was settled by a Bas Kol. (Not that there aren't other answers to that, but it is certainly a straight forward explanation). The Talmud itself suggests this as a possibility in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eruvin 6b-7a</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

And even as they did provoke <strong>Me to anger seven hundred\n  years,</strong> so I will surely anger them and make them jealous with a\n  foolish nation and a nation for which I set apart no kingdom, in that\n  day when I cast lots for all the peoples.

And yet, if they seek My Face, I shall be\n  found of them, and I shall bring them back to their land.”</p>\n  \n  <p>[136]  Said Rabbi Ishmael: I reckoned the reckoning: <strong>For Babylon\n  seventy years and for Media fifty and two and for Greece and hundred\n  and eighty and for Edom accordingly I found the years to the\n  destruction of the second temple to complete seven hundred years.</strong> \n  And I sought in books which Daniel had closed up and sealed, and I\n  found written in them: <strong>“Seven hundred years were determined and\n  decreed upon Thy people and upon Thy holy city and at their\n  fulfillment shall the transgressors</strong> cease and the sinners shall come\n  to an end and the iniquity of a small people shall be atoned and He\n  that is righteous forever shall bring the Messiah who has  remained\n  hidden and sealed [from the sight] of all the prophets and he shall\n  anoint the Holy of Holies.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is really very basic.  What were the date ranges of the 700 years of sin, and what is the final date of R. Ishmael's 700 year reckoning?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Based on the Tzlach , he suggests that there is no problem of creating an interruption because we say, \"Baruch shem...\" quietly. “In other words, a quiet recitation, <strong>a recitation that is different in tone than the normal tefilah voice</strong>, (my emphasis) does not constitute a hefsek.” </p>\n\n<p>\"This is exactly the point Rashi and the Rokeach were making.  Through shome'a k'oneh listening counts the same as a recitation of kedusha, but since that recitation takes place silently, it does not count as an interruption.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can extend his idea a little to include the humming.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, at least for the first brachah of Shmone Esrei see <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5757/pekudei.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>\nOC 101:1. “In addition, one must not think other <strong>thoughts</strong> during the first brachah of Shmone Esrei, even when not actually saying the words. According to some poskim, those thoughts may constitute a hefsek which may invalidate the brachah - see Mishnah Berurah 63:13 and Biur Halachah 101:1 quoting the Rashba and Igros Moshe OC 5:5.”</p>\n\n<p>It’s a clear CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

Because outside of Israel, you can not declare new fasts, and many of the fasts that were declared were <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/pinchas/yis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">optional based on historical circumstances</a>. (i.e. Shmad)  The Gemora in Taanit 11b or 12b says that \"There are No communal fasts in Bavel save for Tisha B'Av\" So in Bavel, only Tisha B'av was a fast which could be declared and kept on the public level for all generations, and so they renamed the messechet to Taanit, instead of Taaniot.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban writes (as quoted in the Ran):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין שם תענית ציבור בבבל אלא כל התעניות שמתענין בבבל אינן אלא כתענית\n  יחיד. לפיכך אינו אסור בחומר תענות צבור. והטעם מפני שהדיינין שלהם\n  הדיוטות הם ולא סמוכין ולא היה להם נשיא שתהא גזרתו קיימת על כל ישראל.\n  לפיכך כשהצבור מקבלין תענית צריכין לקבל כולן על עצמן כיחידים שכל אחד\n  מקבל על עצמו, ומשום הכי אינו חייב לנהוג בו אלא כתענית יחיד. אבל בארץ\n  ישראל שהיה להם נשיא, לא היו צריכין לקבל על עצמן לפי שגזירתו קיימת על\n  כולן וכולהו בתריה גרירי.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>There are no communal fasts in Bavel; rather, all the fasts that they\n  observe in Bavel are merely individual fasts. Therefore, they are not\n  bound by the stringent prohibitions of a communal fast. And the reason\n  is because their judges are laypeople and do not have semichah\n  (rabbinical ordination)* and they did not have a nasi (president)\n  whose decree would be valid for all Israel. Therefore, when the\n  community accepts a fast, they all have to accept it upon themselves\n  as indivduals, everyone accepting it upon him/herself, and because of\n  this, they only have to behave as on an individual fast.

    "content": "# Halachically skipping Purim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There have long been 'legends' of various liberal figures in Judaism, including Yeshayahu Leibovitz (brother of Nechama Leibovitz) that would 'skip' Purim. On the 14th of Adar they would be sure to be in Jerusalem, while on the 15th of Adar they would be sure to be outside of Jerusalem, thereby avoiding the halachic requirement of fulfilling the mitzvah of Purim. The reason given is that Purim can be perceived as an 'immoral' holiday, celebrating the murder of tens of thousands members of the Persian empire at the hands of Jews (though possibly explainable as self-defense).</p>\n\n<p>a) I've seen multiple sources referring to this story, some claiming it as fact, others claiming it as fiction. Does anyone have any clear cut sources on the matter?</p>\n\n<p>b) Is there any reference in halachic literature to such a practice? Is it explicitly looked down upon? How about the more general idea of putting oneself in a position in order to be exempted from a mitzvah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I've never heard of anyone purposely skipping Purim. I think that's a separate question.</p>\n\n<p>But as far as the behavior of someone purposely trying to get exempted from a Mitzva, the Gemara says that someone who goes out of his way to round his four-cornered garment so he'll be exempted from the mitzva of tzitzis, when Hashem is angry, watch out. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein applied this to strongly frown upon those who might say on Sukkos: \"hm I'll just choose to do a two-day trip to an amusement park for the fun of it over Chol HaMoed, and woops! I'm a traveller so I don't need a sukkah.\"</p>\n\n<p>Similarly one of the strongest explanations for the Mishna's prohibition on getting on a boat a few days before Shabbos is it's likely (or at leased <em>used to be likely</em>) that when on the boat, a situation will arise in which life-threatening matters may come up, forcing a violation of Shabbos. You ideally shouldn't put yourself in such a situation.</p>\n\n<p>There are a series of questions & answers relating to the various Jewish holidays that have been asked of IDF rabbis over the years; one of them was in fact \"the way it turned out, I was stationed in an <em>old</em> city on the 14th, and a <em>new</em> city on the 15th, so I never heard megillah.\" The answer was: \"well yes congratulations you've circumvented the mitzvah altogether, but doing so should be avoided if at all possible.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a machlokes Rishonim about the status of a traveling Ben Ir and a Ben Kerach around Purim.

Their ability to do so effectively was resultant of their success in the heder system - itself largely dependent upon how much money their own parents had. (Teaching in heder was not a well-paid position, and most heders had ridiculously large class sizes). You can read more about this in <a href=\"http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Yeshiva/The_Yeshiva_before_1800\">this YIVO article</a>, and in Shaul Stampfer's essay on early marriage in his <em><a href=\"http://www.littman.co.uk/cat/stampfer-families.html\">Families, Rabbis and Education</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>As for Volozhin, Stampfer (<em><a href=\"http://www.littman.co.uk/cat/stampfer.html\">Lithuanian Yeshivas of the Nineteenth Century</a></em>) suggests that R' Hayim introduced several innovations, on the basis of which it has come to be viewed as the first yeshiva in a modern sense. The most important of these is that of fund-raising.</p>\n\n<p>Before Volozhin, a yeshiva (or beis midrash) was established by the community in which it existed. They built it, they hired the rosh yeshiva, they paid any teachers and they, more or less, supplied the students. If students travelled from a distance, they slept in the beis midrash itself, and were reliant upon the hospitality of the townspeople. As such, the local community was intimately involved, and if there was anything they didn't like they could see to it that it was changed.</p>\n\n<p>R' Hayim promoted Volozhin as an institute for <em>advanced</em> Talmudic study, and due to his reputation as the great disciple of the Gra, funding came from far and wide. So too, incidentally, did students. As a result, the local community had nothing to do with the establishment of the yeshiva, and the students (who were given a stipend by R' Hayim) could pay them for their hospitality. As such, the yeshiva of Volozhin was completely distinct from the town of Volozhin, and this became something of a precedent. In time, it would happen that the Rosh Yeshiva of a major institution would be <em>the</em> authority within the local community, even hiring the town's other rabbonim and effectively replacing the beis din. For the replacement of the beis din by the Rosh Yeshiva in Lithuania - see the YIVO article on <a href=\"http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Orthodoxy\">Orthodoxy</a> (the paragraph on Hatam Sofer).</p>\n\n<p>Other major innovations included the fact that R' Hayim appointed a deputy - something hitherto unheard of - and hired maggidei shiur to supplement his own teaching. This provided the yeshiva with an opportunity to attract more students, and to have guest lecturers who could increase their own reputation in the process.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know the extent to which it was an innovation of Volozhin, but in terms of comparing it to other yeshivas it is worth noting that the chavruta system was a distinctly Polish/Lithuanian phenomenon and that yeshivas in Hungary were quite different. They had more student/teacher interaction, formal class times and exams. Study at Volozhin was largely private, and although shiurim were given by the Rosh Yeshiva, his deputy and by other maggidei shiur, students could learn whatever they want. By the late 19th century, and perhaps as a result, Volozhin had become a beacon for young maskilim, and many of the students left it to pursue a university education.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>My understanding is that until that point, if you wanted to study you'd have to pay your own way and find someplace to study. The Volozhin yeshiva raised funds, and didn't charge tuition. So it decoupled the education from paying for it. It was also more officially organized and centralized; usually you'd have to wander from town to town and unofficially study with the town rabbi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Berel Wein has good lectures on this. here's an article based on his lectures</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, was to have a central place of learning.

The former before making a bracha, the latter afterwards.\"</p>\n\n<p>But to really make things interesting, here are two more points to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There's one place where Rashi talks about stealing \"the bracha\", not the food. This is explained as talking about a case where you just say a <em>shehakol</em> on everything, rather than properly identifying and articulating the right bracha. Hey you said some kind of thanks so you're not \"stealing the food from G-d\", but you really should be saying the right bracha. (So if you will, you could call this the <em>matir</em> has been satisfied but not the <em>mitzva</em>.)</p></li>\n<li><p>An <em>onen</em> (someone caught up in the burial plans of an immediate relative) is told to be passive and not perform any \"yes-do\" mitzvahs other than the burial. An <em>onen</em> does <em>not</em> recite brachos before eating (I've heard several mourners describing that first moment of eating without a bracha, when it sets in just how much their world has changed.) Presumably whatever <em>matir</em> component is lifted too?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R' Yosef Dov Soloveitchik was famous for applying the concept of Matir to Berachoth of all types. If I'm not mistaken, his general fallback example was Berachoth HaNehenin (eg., <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/pesachim/13oveir.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">just like you need to say \"Ha'Eitz\" to be Matir your apple to you, so to you need to say Birchos HaTorah as a Matir to learn</a>, etc.).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Short Answer: It is a <em>machlokes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Pri Megadim (משבצות זהב סי' קס\"ז סק\"י) definitively states that there is no issur to eat without a <em>bracha</em>, merely an obligation to bless before eating. Accordingly, the <em>bracha</em> is a <em>mitzva</em>, not a <em>mattir</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>דמי אמרה תורה לא תאכל בלי ברכה אלא מצוה  עשה לברך קודם</strong>, ומ״מ מי שלא\n  בירך המוציא ואוכל ביטל כעין מצות עשה שלא בירך אבל אכילה לא הוה באיסור,\n  ודיו לבא מן הדין מה ברכה שאחר אכילה לאו אכילה באיסור הוה אעפ״י שלא\n  בירך אח״כ ברהמ״ז הוא הדין זה, עכ\"ל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is echoed by the Netziv (מרומי שדה ברכות), who equates one who does not know how to bless to one who has no mezuzah to afix to his door.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עכ\"פ כשאינו יודע לברך לפני האוכל הרי זה דומה למי למי שאין לו מזוזה\n  בביתו, שמותר לדור בביתו אלא שמצוה לקבוע מזוזה אם אפשר, ולא כטלית בלא\n  ציצית שאסור ללבוש הטלית כמבואר בהעמק שאלה שלח</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Related discussions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.

The classification of the ברכה.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Rashi</em> (<em>Brochos</em> 35) writes that a blessing is a הודאה for eating. The <em>Ritva</em>, however, defines a blessing as a נטילת רשות. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פירוש משום דכתיב לה' הארץ ומלואה כדלקמן, והאיך יטול אדם מה שאינו שלו\n  <strong>ולא יטול ממנו רשות</strong> (ריטב״א)</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[Accordingly, the Ritva explains the dictum כל הנהנה מעולם הזה בלא ברכה כאילו מעל/גוזל as referring specifically to the Brocho Rishona ('וכולהו ברכות <strong>לפניהם</strong> אתו מהאי סברא'). The Rashba however explains it as referring to both the for-blessing and after-blessing.]</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Correspondingly, Rashi and Ritva argue if 'כאילו גוזל מה׳' (when not blessing) refers to stealing the blessing or the food.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <em>Chayei Odom</em> (49.1) writes that a blessing is like a <em>pidyon</em>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתיב לה' הארץ ומלואה וא\"כ הכל הוא כמו הקדש וכמו שאסור להנות מהקדש כי אם\n  לאחר פדיון והנהנה מהם בלא פדיון מעל בקדשי ה' <strong>כן אסור להנות מעולם הזה\n  בלא ברכה והיא הפדיון</strong> והנהנה בלא ברכה כאלו מעל בקדשי ה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3. Trangressing and eating without a ברכה</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When eating without a ברכה, is this transgressing בקום ועשה (eating something forbidden), or בשב ואל תעשה (not fulfilling obligation of <em>Brocho</em>)? [See aforementioned Pri Megadim for discussion of this.]</p></li>\n<li><p>R' Shlomo Kluger (שו\"ת באלף לך שלמה או\"ח סי' שכ\"א) rules that one who eats <em>Matza</em> without blessing, is like eating stolen <em>matzah</em> and does not discharge his obligation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbeinu Yona (beginning of כיצד מברכים) writes that one who eats without a blessing is חייב קרבן מעילה. He apparently takes the Gemara 'כאילו מעל' literally.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>4. Blessing <em>before</em> eating</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Rishonim discuss why one needs to bless specifically <em>before</em> eating. The Ramban and Ritva (Pesachim 7) explain this is because it is forbidden to eat before blessing, indicating that the Brocho is a Matir. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והוי יודע שלא כלל שמואל כאן אלא כל המצות כולן אבל שאר ברכות לא דברכות\n  הנהנין ודאי קודם שיהנה מהן שאסור ליהנות מעוה\"ז בלא ברכה כדאיתא בברכות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yona (Brachos 51), however, equates this with the universal rule of כל הברכות כולן מברכין עובר לעשייתן, indicating that it is not a Mattir.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל כאן שהיה ראוי לברך מתחלה והיה לו לברך קודם כדאמרינן כל המצות כולן\n  מברכין עליהם עובר לעשייתן ונדחה שלא בירך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Maybe 50% or maybe even 80%, but not <em>all</em> the Jews in Shushan.</p>\n\n<p>The simple answer might be that it was a miracle whereby everybody just wanted to do the right thing and agreed to listen to Mordechai and not eat for 3 days straight. Essentially suggesting that we lost our own willpower. If that's the case however, then how would the fast actually bring about the redemption like it seemed to do in the story of Purim? It wouldn't be on our own merit if Hashem suspended our free will.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it seems that it must have been due to the people's own will to collectively take on this fast. The question is how could <em>every</em> Jew in the city of Shushan agree to do this? Not one Jew disagreed with Mordechai?!</p>\n\n<p>I think this is very important because it seems the they key to forging Jewish unity is found in whatever approach Mordechai must have used to instantly rouse the Jewish people to fast. The Megilla doesn't really tell us what Mordechai did to rouse the collective will of all the Jews. It just says that \"Mordechai went and did everything that Esther had instructed him\".</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, Mordechai only heard about the decree the night before (or the previous day) and Esther didn't even yet know about the decree until he told her through a messenger, so the people of Shushan may not have even realized the immediate threat (unless the news spread quickly, but even if it did it wouldn't necessarily be deemed \"credible\" by everybody).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The second part of the question is why did Esther <em>only</em> requested that the Jews of Shushan fast? Sure, it was practical since it must have been hard to spread information over long distances in those days. However, the fast itself (for three whole days and nights) was impractical and yet the dire circumstances called for it. So, why limit it only to the Jews of Shushan?</p>\n\n<p>That is my question. I have already read something which I think might be <em>an</em> answer, but I'm curious what everybody here has to say. Thanks for reading my long-winded question and happy Purim!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>About the second part of the question: Yalkut Shimoni (to Esther 4:16) says that he limited the fast to those \"found in Shushan\" because they were the ones who had eaten at Achashverosh's feast. The Jews in the rest of the empire weren't guilty of that.</p>\n\n<p>[That they too were in danger is attributed by R. Shimon bar Yochai (Megillah 12a) to their having bowed to Nevuchadnetzar's statue. Presumably, then, since that wasn't a sin that had anything to do with eating, the corresponding penitential act (teshuvas hamishkal) needn't have involved fasting.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The simple answer is two-fold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Jews already knew that the decree had occurred, and they were quite upset about (\"<em>v'hair shushan navocha</em>\").

Given (1), people were probably <em>waiting</em> for him to make a statement about the situation.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There may be a more complex answer, but that just follows from the simple reading of the megilla.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Since the fast started right away, Mordechai didn't have time to send messengers to the other provinces to tell them to fast.

Chalitza is publicly shaming the brother-in-law.</p>\n\n<p>Haman was hoping to have himself publicly praised, but instead got himself publicly shamed.</p>\n\n<p>There's another strong parallel between the chalitza verses and the Shushan-ride verses -- the word \"chafetz\", or \"desire.\" \"Who the king desires to honor\" (in Esther), \"I don't desire to marry her\" (chalitza). </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara talks about how a king rides atop a horse; a common businessman atop a donkey, and any human atop shoes. Malbim says this is about free will and control. A king has control over many other people (especially as he can send them off to war); a businessman control over enterprise; and any human being has free will and control over his own actions, thus his shoes represent the separation between the earth that formed him -- i.e. between his stimulus and response.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim goes further: normally what G-d \"wants\", so to speak, is that a man not marry his sister-in-law. But if his brother died childless, G-d overrides His \"want\", so the name can be carried on. This recalcitrant brother who says \"but I don't <em>want</em> to marry her!\" is shamed -- <em>okay so you want or don't want whatever; can't you exercise some self-control and overcome your wants? You don't deserve to wear shoes. Phooey to you.</em> </p>\n\n<p>So it's actually quite the contrast. Achashverosh had his every whim turned into reality, even at the expense of killing people.

    "content": "# What was daily life like for Jewish women living in al-Andalus in the 10th/11th centuries?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The emir of Al-Andalus (approximately the Iberian peninsula) declared himself a new caliph, breaking off from the caliphate in the east, circa 950 CE.  I have read that the next couple hundred years were particularly good -- as European medieval history goes -- for the Jews.  Histories of the time talk about the freedoms available to Jewish businessmen and professionals (like doctors).  The ones I've found are light on \"daily life\", particularly for women.</p>\n\n<p>From the perspectice of Jewish practice, what did a typical day look like for a woman living then and there?  Did she pray (how?), participate in Jewish education (e.g. as a teacher), study Jewish topics (what?), have any leadership role in the community?  What customs or halacha governed interactions with men, or with the non-Jews living there at the time?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Here's a start. The historian Norman Roth, in his <em>Daily Life of the Jews in the Middle Ages</em>, writes about the role of women in Spain (as well as Ashkenazic lands) at that time. On pg. 54, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...in all Muslim lands, and in Christian as well as Muslim Spain, women had equality with men in all business transactions. This meant that they could acquire goods and property in their own name, sell the same, and often engage in significant commercial transactions. In Christian Spain, at least, property was in joint ownership of husband and wife, and documents of purchase or sale bear the signatures of both. There were, both in Egypt and in Christian Spain, examples of women who achieved considerable success in commerce and became quite wealthy. In Europe generally, Jewish women often engaged in business, assisting in farm work or selling goods, and this helped family finances, or in some cases was the sole means of support while the husband pursued talmudic studies (that became far more customary than in the early modern period in eastern Europe). </p>\n  \n  <p>All women could sew, as well as spin wool or cotton and weave, and many also earned money this way (this was probably not the case with the more aristocratic women in Muslim lands). Young girls were taught these skills by their mothers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For more information, see the \"Jewish Women in the Middle Ages\" chapter in Jon Bloomberg's <em>The Jewish world in the Middle Ages</em>. One of the most important books for your question is <em>Jewish Women in Historical Perspective</em>, ed. Judith R. Baskin. A great chapter called \"Sephardi Women in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods\" by Renee Levine Melamed particularly covers a lot of ground. For example, on pg. 133-134 she writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The discovery that Jewish women participated in the medical profession in medieval Spain is unexpected in light of the meager education usually provided for girls of all faiths in Spain. Most women were illiterate, although \"their illiteracy was not an obstacle to carrying on practical business.\" Ashtor explains that a girl's education was the responsibility of her mother, who taught her spinning and other forms of domestic work. Both Jewish and non-Jewish women supported themselves by spinning, knitting, or weaving, while those in comfortable financial situations learned these crafts as pastimes. Beyond needlework, the poor Jewish woman had very limited options. There are examples of Jewish girls as servants in Jewish homes, but this was the exception rather than the rule, and most household servants were not Jewish. Sometimes the community provided means of livelihood for less fortunate women. For instance, \"Jewish and Moslem women were engaged as professional wailers by Christians as well as by their own coreligionists.\"  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hope that helps. </p>\n\n\n",

Correct me if I am wrong.    To some extent, the major challenge to Purim is time-management.  </p>\n\n<p>The first thing to help with this is planning.  Sit down with your spouse and children if the latter are of an age to be involved in the decision making process.  Plan out who is going to megilla reading when (do you and your spouse want to go together or seperately, who will take a car if you share, etc).  Plan out when and where you will have your meal.  When and where will mincha be said by anyone who wants to say it.  I'd say fit in distribution of matanot l'evyonim and mishloach manot around those things.  (This may be easier said than done).  Planning ahead helps reduce the stress of trying to do too much on the day of Purim itself, or making decisions after one may have begun to imbibe.</p>\n\n<p>The second piece of advice I have is that as in many areas, people go overboard.  The meal does not need to take forever or include 12 courses.  One does not need to give mishloach manot to every person in the neighborhood.  Giving two foods to one person suffices.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. </p>\n\n\n",

With sins between you and your fellow man, you have to ask G-d for forgiveness, but only after you've sought the forgiveness of the one you wronged. That person is obligated to forgive you if you are sincere, so all you have to do is try sincerely to repent to them. If they reject you, you tried.  All of this hinges on sincerity. Insincere repentance is worse than worthless. </p>\n\n<p>Since we are potentially discussing murder, it is worth pointing out that in extreme circumstances, it is possible to seek forgiveness even from the dead. For this you should certainly consult a rabbi, as you really should for any practical application of these concepts. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>With respect to what constitutes destroying a soul:</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Primarily it is referring to taking a life. There are other meanings, especially in the reverse (rescuing a soul), that refer to spiritual matters, but these are things having to do with one's spiritual growth and development. If you act as a mentor to someone who seems lost and wandering in life and assist them to become good, upstanding members of society, particularly if this person is Jewish and your guidance leads to their living a more religious and spiritual life (and assuming this is a positive and uplifting experience for them) and this carries forward to their family and children and grandchildren, then I've seen people apply this concept to that mentor (or those mentors) who helped facilitate this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With respect to making amends:</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>One can only do what is in one's abilities. If you have driven someone away from living a positive and fulfilling life, Ḥas VeShalom, then you certainly ought to do your best to find the person and make amends. However, if you cannot find the person, I would advise you to speak with a religious leader about ways to repent without apologizing. Even if you can find this person, it is possible that the impact you had on his or her life was so detrimental (as implied by the question) that he or she may not forgive you.  There are rules about seeking forgiveness on 3 separate occasions and, afterward, the sin reverting  to the other party who won't forgive (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/15.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">RaMBa\"M Hil. Teshuvah 2:9</a>). However, I would caution you that seeking forgiveness from someone who was deeply hurt, and doesn't just have some unreasonable grudge for some slight years ago, is not likely to be met with appreciation, and that person is not likely to forgive at all, and this rule may not apply. Again, I would advise you to seek guidance from a religious leader whom you trust.</p>\n\n<p>Although taking someone's life is considered something for which one cannot really make amends, and which Yom Kippur itself does not atone, if one is truly remorseful and repents for it to the best of one's ability, then, according to the RaMBa\"M (ibid., 1:4) any suffering experienced one's life will provide provisional atonement, which will be granted at the end of one's life.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, RaMBa\"M advises (ibid., 2:11), that if someone sins against his fellow, and the fellow dies before the sinner can ask forgiveness, that the sinner go to the person's grave with 10 other people and confess his sin to them.</p>\n\n<p>A free translation of the formula for the above request for forgiveness at a grave:\n\"I have sinned to HaShem, the G-d of Israel, and to this person named [so-and-so], in that I did [such-and-such].\" At that point, if he owed the victim money, per the RaMBa\"M, he should pay it to an heir; if there is no heir, so far as he knows, he should deposit it with a Beith Din and confess.</p>\n\n\n",

If, for example, you realize at the end of shmoneh esre during aseret yemei tshuva that you forgot to say hamelech hakadosh, why does that warrant a repetition of the entire shmoneh esre?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In general, as explained in Shulchan Aruch Horav Siman 114:8 if one changes the start and end of any Beracha from the way the Anshei Keneses Hagdolah established, then the Beracha is invalid hence the person did not fulfill his/her obligation. Now, the first 3 Berochos are considered one unit and the last 3 Berochos are considered one unit, therefore, if one made a mistake in one of them (meaning: 1 of the 3 first or 1 of the 3 last Berochos) then all 3 are invalid. However, the other 13 Berochos are separate units. In short, when one makes a mistake, and did not yet finish Shmone Esrei, s/he goes back to the beginning of that unit, i.e. if one forgets Tal Umatar they go back to the Borech Aleinu unit; if one forgets Hamelech Hakodosh they go back to the first 3 Berochos unit. But once s/he finished SA there is no way to go back to a unit without starting over from the beginning.\nBesides the beginning and ending of Berochos there are certain phrases which the Anshei Keneses Hagdolah ordained that they must be said and if they were not said then that unit is invalid and one has to go back to that unit as explained above.<br>\n[Edit:] Besides the beginning and end of  Berochos there are other factors as well like the lack of mentioning the uniqueness of the day which is said of the recognition of the day given to us by HKBH, like Rosh Chodesh, calls for a repeat. The lack of mentioning Gevuras Geshamem is as important as Techiyas Hameisim (but it can't be mentioned in the winter because at that time of the year it's a curse) and therefore the lack thereof calls for a repeat. Asking for rain in Bareich Aleinu is very important because we are asking HKBH to keep us alive by giving us food (rain causes food to grow), lack of asking for our livelihood straight from The Source of Life calls for a repeat.(In the winter we don't ask for rain because then it's a curse.) By Hamelech Hakodosh (and also Hamelech Hamishpot according to those who apply the  same rules) it's because we must be aware and cognizant of the fact that HKBH is judging the world and lack of this recognition calls for a repeat.</p>\n\n\n",

Couldn't he just buy the field from Ruth?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It would appear that nothing here was in the bounds of absolute strict obligation. (The Torah only strictly obligates yibum for the brother of the deceased; Boaz and Ploni were more distant relatives.) Nonetheless, it was felt that to honor Elimelech's memory, it was appropriate that one person both buy his ancestral fields, so they'd be back in the family, and marry the widow. I guess if it's an honor, you don't go in halfsies.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Malbim's commentary, Boaz chose to do Yibum in order to spiritually reincarnate Rus's deceased husband, Machalon, which is the Zohar's approach to what happens in Yibum - the soul of the deceased is reincarnated into the son born of the Yibum union. (See Malbim to 4:14, for example.)</p>\n\n<p>Along the same lines, he may have chosen to acquire the field through Yibum instead of acquiring it separately in order that it be the nachala (inheritence) of Machalon, and not his own unrelated property, as the Malbim explains at the end of verse 4:5 that the field acquired through Yibum will be associated with the deceased.</p>\n\n<p>The implication of the Malbim is, however, that Tov had no option to buy the field, and it was not merely a choice to acquire it through Yibum instead of purchasing it, but rather this was the only option of how to get the field belonging to Rus, as is clear in his commentary to the first part of verse 4:5.  This could possibly be because (my own suggestion) Rus was unwilling to sell the field in order that it be a \"bargaining chip\" to have Yibum, especially once she knew that Boaz was willing to do Yibum once Tov stepped out of the way (verse 3:13).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't Tanach regularly studied in many Yeshivot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=24&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot in Sanhedrin 24a</a>\nthat says that by learning Gemara one does <strong>not</strong> fulfill what the Gemara  (Kidushin 30a, Avoda Zara 19a) says: one should split his learning into three ---   Mikra, Mishna, and Gemara. I know he answers this question saying that we fulfill this obligation by reading the Korbanot and prayers before Hodu. However, I have two questions for nowadays:</p>\n\n<p>1) HaRav Chaim Kanievsky Shelit\"a says that there is no Hiyuv to read the Korbanot except for the Parashat HaTamid (which one doesn't fulfill Mikra with). According to him, how are people that omit Akeda and other sections of Mikra Yotze for the third? </p>\n\n<p>2) Even though people fulfill their obligation with the prayers before Hodu, why isn't Tanach so regularly studied at Yeshivot? I'm not asking your personal opinion, I want to know if any Roshei Yeshivot or Posekim discuss this.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you and always, source responsibly </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Shternbuch writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20026&st=&pgnum=390\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Teshuvot VeHanhagot 2:457</a> that even though the gemara implies one should learn tanach first, this is no longer true as learning tanach can be dangerous for learning it simply (without appropriate commentaries and guidance) can lead one to heresy. As such, one should first learn lots of gemara and only then dabble in tanach with appropriate commentaries.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shmuel HaLevi Wosner writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1418&pgnum=195\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shevet HaLevi 8:207</a> that indeed one should master the basics of Tanach and Hebrew grammar, but one should  not  spend too much time that it takes away from learning gemara and rishonim which is the most important form of talmud torah. He claims all great rabbis knew tanach well even if they hid their knowledge. He notes finally that the study of such a central corpus as tanach does not need his endorsement.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The question asked about Yeshivot who do not regularly study Tanach. I conclude by noting that some Yeshivot do in fact actively advocate studying Tanach. For more about that perspective see the article <a href=\"http://www.kolhamevaser.com/2011/11/nakh-the-neglected-nineteen/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Nach: The Neglected Nineteen\"</a> by R' Gilad Barach and particularly his quotes from Rabbis Aharon Lichtenstein and Michael Rosensweig.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25076&st=&pgnum=468\">Hilchos Talmud Torah</a> of R' Shneiur Zalman of Liadi is written that the custom is not to teach children Tanach since they can learn it on their own (in the time of the Mishna, one would not be able to do that as the Nekudos and Trop are a Halacha Lemoshe MiSinai which was not written down).</p>\n\n<p>However, he says that one must learn Chumash, as it's the source of most Drashos which are mentioned in the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>It appears from there that the purpose of a Yeshiva is as an extension of Cheder (which he writes explicitly that it's purpose is to prepare one to learn).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>With regard to your first question, tosfos (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kidushin 30a</a> ד\"ה לא) quote the shita of Rabeinu Tam who explains that the Talmud Bavli is a mixture of mikra, mishnah, and gemara. Therefore, the requirement to learn all 3 every day is fulfilled by learning Talmud Bavli (he bases this on the gemara which says that the bavli is a mixture playing on the word bavli). It is clear from his view that the chiyuv is not to split up learning into equal 3rds. (See the Rambam <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=3&perek=1&halocha=11&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Torah 1:11</a> who disagrees, and the Ron for a bigger discussion.) So long as one learns all 3 one fulfilles the chiyuv. The Rama (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=137\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh De'ah 246:4</a>) paskons like Rabeinu Tam and hence by learning Talmud Bavli one fulfills this chiyuv.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, I do think that the halacha represents a broader educational point, which is reflected by many other maamarei chazal as well, that one should have a well rounded Torah education. It is critical to know all the basic areas of Torah. If I may venture to guess as to why that is, it seems at first glance to be for two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each area of Torah has critical elements which the other areas don't have, both in the realm of developing into a yerei hashem and in the realm of achieving yediyas hakadosh baruch hu.</li>\n<li>All of Torah is one. Therefore, if one has an incomplete understanding of tanach, they will not understand gemara properly and vice versa. In light of what was quoted before in the name of Rav Shternbach, I guess I am arguing that not only is it dangerous to learn tanach without knowing gemara. It is dangerous to learn gemara without learning tanach and mishnah. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your second question has bothered me for quite some time. No one would disagree that is immensely important to master tanach b'iyun. Certainly knowing tanach is part of the chiyuv to know kol hatorah kulah (see the <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/ka5/12/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shulchan aruch harav, Hilchos Talmud Torah chapter 1, kuntres acharon note 1</a>) and hence learning all of tanach is an absolute chiyuv. It is also self evident that the words which Hashem found necessary to communicate to mankind for all eternity is of utmost importance and to neglect learning tanach would be a massive chilul hashem. So I repeat, everyone agrees that tanach must be learned, all of it, well. What gadol doesn't know tanach cold? Certainly for chumash, the chiyuv shnayim mikra indicates the absolute necessity to learn chumash weekly and know it well. \nThe question is really - why don't yeshivos incorporate that into their curriculum? Even the ones that do, the time dedicated to tanach is a tiny fraction. I know one common response is that tanach is generally easier to master and therefore doesn't require as much time and would be a waste of the resources available in a yeshiva. In other words, to learn a proper derech halimud in gemara and to develop the skills necessary to master gemara takes a lot more time, study, and direction from talmidei chachamim. Therefore, the yeshiva dedicates nearly all of its time to the study of gemara for this reason. However, the expectation is still that at some point in one's life they master tanach on their own. It is really a matter of different curricula for different stages of life and different periods of opportunity. Certainly in the times of Chazal children mastered tanach before they learned gemara (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37970&st=&pgnum=545\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pirkei avos 5:21</a>). </p>\n\n<p>I would just mention two concerns with this approach:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It isn't only important to have a well rounded torah education in the long run, but also as one develops their knowledge of Torah it is important to have a balance. The balance is essential for growing properly as an oveid hashem (there are many broad lessons and perspectives which one only learns from tanach, which are essentiall to learn as one grows from learning gemara as well).</p></li>\n<li><p>Since tanach has been so neglected by yeshivos, there are very few writings of later achronim on tanach which are written as a rigorous approach to learning pshat in tanach (maybe the one exception amongst the right wing yeshivos is the Emes Lyaakov). Therefore, even the simpler skill set for learning tanach isn't being effectively developed by people who attempt to learn tanach on their own. Meaning, since tanach isn't being taught in yeshivas, the guidance of talmidei chachamim which is necessary for any area of talmud torah has been neglected. Maybe if tanach were learned in yeshivos, HaRav Shternbach's concerns about being corrupted by tanach chalila vchas (it hurts me to even say that one could be corrupted by the wellspring of yiras shamayim) wouldn't be such a concern since talmidei chachamim would be giving their talmidim hadracha in how to learn an approach tanach in a frum way, to understand it properly and for what it is.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

I fold it 3-4-3 (there's no requirement that each fold be the same width), and crease the folds a little so that it naturally bends in those places in the future. Sometimes I fold it in an S shape (the second and third pages facing each other), other times as a G (the third page inside the first two). With the first way, I can tuck the fold between the first and second pages into the curl at the end of the Megillah, and then I don't need to hold both ends; on the other hand, the second way makes it easier to transition from the first page to the second. (By the time I reach the third page, though, I almost always have it in a Z shape, and can tuck the fold to the right of that page into the opening curl.) Either way, though, it's easy enough to handle whether I'm reading at a lectern or not, although again that might just be because it's smaller than the typical one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You could fold the megilla in half and secure the beginning of the scroll to the end of the scroll using 2 or 3 binder clips. This creates a two-sided scroll with half of the columns on each side. This setup will require only 1 page turn during the entire reading.</p>\n\n<p>Because the attached beginning and the end pull in opposite directions, the megilla should stay pretty flat without rolling up, assuming you have a good crease by the fold in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>This setup is very helpful when the reader has no table and no-one to help hold the megilla. The reader can hold each side of the 2-sided scroll in each hand and continuously adjust the sag for the most comfortable reading position for each column.</p>\n\n\n",

Instead, the Jews should be separate from them and distinct in their dress and in their deeds, as they are in their ideals and character traits. In this context, [Leviticus 20:26] states: <em>\"I have separated you from the nations [to be Mine].</em></p>\n  \n  <p><sup>Hilkhoth Avodah Zarah 11:1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are also many great articles to be found online about this subject written by well learned Hakhamim.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n\n\n",

(On the other hand, perhaps it did.) In any event, <strong>my question is why the <em>midrash</em> uses generations instead of a more conventional unit of time (such as years)</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>An initial idea toward a possible answer: Note that <em>Moshe</em> had contemporaries, even Jewish ones, who were more or fewer than twenty-six male-line generations from the creation of the world. For example, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2904.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Nachshon</em> was twenty-eight generations</a>. So \"twenty-six generations\" makes sense only if one refers specifically to <em>Moshe</em>, rather then generally to his time.

Perhaps it is to demonstrate that one must acknowledge that Hashem is present in this world in order for man to accept the Torah, because heretics who believe in the <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/the-clockmaker-theory/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clockmaker Theory</a> would have no reason to perform mitzvos if Hashem no longer interacts in this world (gilui shechina), negating the notion that there is such thing as reward for good and punishment for evil, as well as miracles (nisecha shebechol yom imanu).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What happened to Haman's money?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the more interesting encounters in the megilla takes place between Achashveirosh and Haman right after Haman decides to kill the Jewish people. Having decided on a date, Haman approaches Achashveirosh and makes the following offer (3:9):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם עַל הַמֶּלֶךְ טוֹב יִכָּתֵב לְאַבְּדָם וַעֲשֶׂרֶת אֲלָפִים כִּכַּר כֶּסֶף אֶשְׁקוֹל עַל יְדֵי עֹשֵׂי הַמְּלָאכָה לְהָבִיא  אֶל גִּנְזֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Achashveirosh takes his ring off, gives it to Haman, and makes the following response (3:11):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר הַמֶּלֶךְ לְהָמָן הַכֶּסֶף נָתוּן לָךְ וְהָעָם לַעֲשׂוֹת בּוֹ כַּטּוֹב בְּעֵינֶיךָ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seemingly, Achashveirosh is telling Haman that he doesn’t want the money; Haman can do whatever he wants without paying the King to do so.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this interpretation is that it directly conflicts with later psukim in the megilla. When Mordechai is telling Esther about the situation the Jewish people have been placed into, he uses the following phrase (4:7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּגֶּד לוֹ מָרְדֳּכַי אֵת כָּל-אֲשֶׁר קָרָהוּ וְאֵת פָּרָשַׁת הַכֶּסֶף אֲשֶׁר אָמַר הָמָן לִשְׁקוֹל עַל גִּנְזֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ בַּיְּהוּדִים לְאַבְּדָם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, when Esther is about to reveal to Achashveirosh the extent of Haman’s plans, she again refers to the Jewish nation “being sold” (7:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...כִּי נִמְכַּרְנוּ אֲנִי וְעַמִּי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All these words strongly suggest that money had changed hands, but the earlier p’sukim don’t seem to agree with this. What is the selling that has taken place?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I heard in the name of Rav Yosef Chaim Sonenfeld Zatzal that Haman wanted to give Achashveirosh the money in order to eventually be able to overthrow Achashveirosh. When the people living in his kingdom would see that Haman has paid Achashveirosh for the right to kill the Jews, they would all be concerned, \"Perhaps someone will come up with enough money to convince Achashverosh to have us killed next?\" The eventual outcome would of been that there would of been a rebellion and Achashveirosh would be deposed, and Haman becoming the new king. The money was all part of Haman’s plan to overthrow Achashveirosh - something that Achashveirosh did not fall for. And, Esther, when she realized that this was Haman’s true intention of offering the money all along, made sure to mention this against Haman to Achashveirosh when she was pleading for the Jews - \"for my people have been sold\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Maharal (in his book Or Chadash) infers from the psukim that actually a sale was done, as is clear from the verses you quoted, but following the sale Achashverosh returned the money to Haman as a present. This why he says הכסף נתון לך, which means the money is given to Haman, because he is actually giving the money to Haman following the sale. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Malbim reads this as Haman saying that he will be able to get the 10,000 talents of silver from those who wipe out the Jews (ie they will happily pay for the privilege). </p>\n\n<p>I read Achashveirosh's response as assuming that the second Haman offered the money it was automatically given to the king (l'havdil, amirato l'gevo'ah) and now Achashveirosh was appointing Haman to be in charge of those funds and the nation and to do with both as he saw fit. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What happened to Chasidus?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When one reads stories of the old Chasidim, from the Baal Shem Tov through the first few generations, the impression one is left with is of a movement very different from the Chasidim of today.  Specifically, Chasidim today are, across the board, associated with a level of stringency equalling if not exceeding that of other movements within Torah Judaism.  </p>\n\n<p>Where a Chosid of old might have considered himself to have davened Shacharis by going out into a forest for heartfelt conversation with G-d (R' Zisha, according to Buber's \"Tales of the Hasidim\") or sobbing into the paroches for five minutes at 2PM (told by R' Shlomo z'l about a Kotzker Chosid), this kind of behavior would be unthinkable in any Chasidic community today.</p>\n\n<p>Was there a focal point at which the Chasidic movement re-aligned itself with the orthodoxy from which it originally sought to break?  If Chasidus was an attempt to revive Judaism and free it from the excessive legalism and stringency that dominated Ashkenazi Jewry until then, what caused it to apparently fall in to the same trap?</p>\n\n<p>Having written this question, I now want to stress that I don't think immersion in stringency and legalism is a trap.  Rather, it is a legitimate expression of Judaism.  I'm just trying to better understand how and why Chasidus came back around to that which it seems to have originally been striving against.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Each generation of Chassidus had a different purpose. The Baal Shem Tov connected to the simple Jew, to show him or her that just because they are not learned in Torah doesn't mean that they don't have a connection to G-d. He traveled around Europe encouraging the Jewish people and waking them up from a spiritual slumber. The Maggid of Mezritch did not travel, instead he surrounded himself with an inner circle of tzaddikim to map out a spiritual plan to revive Jewish spiritual life. If the early Chassidim were not concerned with halacha but instead with a forest meditation, why would the Maggid ask the Alter Rebbe of Chabad to compile a Shulchan Aruch? Why would Rebbe Nachman, who is one of the biggest supporters of forest meditation, write that a Jew must learn Gemara and Shulchan Aruch? </p>\n\n<p>IMHO the Chassidim experienced unbelievable success. Generations later those simple Jews have decedents that are Rabbis and Talmidei HaChamim. The movement has translated and printed more literature that helps one connect to G-d than ever before in history. </p>\n\n<p>Most Chassidim today do not live near forests, and while Chabad and Breslov stress meditation, the rest of the Chassidim took the route of living a strict Torah life. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the \"Chumrahs and Stringencies\" that we have today, come from those generations; they were not made up in America or Israel. </p>\n\n<p>I agree that Chassidus has changed, mostly due to a mass uprooting of the Chassidic world, with millions being burned alive and the survivors moving across the world to America or Israel. Communities merged and completely absorbed each other. </p>\n\n<p>Chassidus never sought to \"break away from\" Orthodoxy. It sought to give the non-elite a chance to live that Torah life that was locked away by the elite. The Chassidim wanted all Jews to be learned in Hashem's Torah which the Tanya quotes as being literally the \"will of Hashem\" and by learning it you connect to Hashem on an unbelievable level. </p>\n\n<p>I agree that the spiritual vibrancy of Chassidus of old has left the movement, but IMHO you can thank the Holocaust for part of that. While WWI and the Industrial Revolution had devastating effects on European Jewry, it did not systematically destroy entire Chassidic Courts. The result of WWII is that a Satmar Chasid now was living next to Sephardim, Polish Chassidim, Litvaks and other Jews that never before had been the case. As the Rambam says in Hilchos Deos; You are product of your environment. Chassidim were now influenced by each other and other streams in Orthodox Judaism. Now 60 years later we are seeing the results of this. </p>\n\n<p>Chassidus Chabad and Chassidus Breslov took some of your concerns and transformed them into what is known today as the \"kiruv\" movement which seeks to bring back Jewish souls to Hashem and the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Some might disagree, but Chabad Chassidus is the foundation of the \"Kiruv\" Movement, which is what some might consider to be a revival of the original vision of the Baal Shem Tov.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br>\nChassidus has already accomplished much of what it set out to do, and has caused significant changes in the \"mainstream\" of yesteryear, such that the non-Chassidism of today is really a product of both the \"mainstream\" of yesteryear, and Chassidus itself.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Warning: Serious over-simplifications below.</p>\n\n<p>While it is true that Chassidus has changed quite a bit from it's origins, I disagree that Chassidus has returned to the ways and practices that it originally broke from.</p>\n\n<p>As mochin rechavim's answer correctly points out, one of the main points of Chassidus was to break away from the idea that the only way to serve G-d properly was to be a Talmid Chocham, and if you weren't, you were a nothing. This was simply the metzius of how simple Jews were viewed back then. If a Jew couldn't learn Torah, then he was viewed as inferior. In addition, if a Jew <em>didn't</em> learn Torah, or didn't do mitzvos, he was considered completely lost to Judaism. I don't mean halachically, I mean in the public perception.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as everyone knows, Torah learning is incredibly vital to Jewish life (and learning ;-)). (Toras HaChassidus itself is Torah of the deepest and most profound kind.) But this does not mean that it is the only way to connect to G-d. Chassidus taught (and teaches) that the Jew is innately connected to G-d, and is precious to G-d no matter what. This had (and has) the effect of: 1) causing the Jew to feel closer to G-d, and to therefore act in such a way, and 2) removing sadness and depression from the Jew, and replacing it with joy. (As is known, the Besht and other Chassidic masters placed much emphasis on serving G-d with <strong>joy</strong>.)</p>\n\n<p>So this was one of the things that Chassidus set out to accomplish (and was incredibly successful at, I believe): to change that perceived inferiority of the simple Jew. This was necessary in two ways: 1) to change the community's perception of unlearned Jews, and 2) to change the unlearned Jew's perception of himself.</p>\n\n<p>In this respect, Chassidus was incredibly successful. Look around today to see how much. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Also, Chassidus also introduced Toras Hachassidus, a new dimension in learning and understanding G-d and his Torah. This is certainly still studied today.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As far as breaking away from <em>\"the excessive legalism and stringency that dominated Ashkenazi Jewry\"</em>, I'd say that Chassidus wanted something more. </p>\n\n<p>Chassidus injected an idea of connection and closeness to G-d that (I believe) did not exist before. It tried to show that observing halacha by rote is, at best, half the picture. It was at least equally important to think about the One who you're learning about, or praying to, as it was to learn and pray in the first place. This is not to say that Chassidus advocated (or advocates) anything less than what halacha requires. But it tried to bring back the <em>life</em> into it's observance. Chassidus wanted to make Jewish practice more G-d-conscious.</p>\n\n<p>I'd say that Chassidus has been successful at this, and is continuing to try to bring this into the public consciousness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Has Chassidus moved back more into the \"mainstream\" from when it first started? Yes. This is a result of both Chassidus moving towards the \"mainstream\", but also, and perhaps more importantly, of the \"mainstream\" moving towards Chassidus. </p>\n\n<p>I'd compare this to the Rambam's dictum: When you want to change a flaw, move to the opposite extreme. Then, once you've become accustomed to that, you will be able to move toward the middle.</p>\n\n<p>Also, as mochin recahvim said, every generation needs something else, and this is what this generation needs. What was necessary for yesteryear's generation may no longer be necessary for our's. So while Toras HaChassidus and the fundamentals of it's practice and theology (for example \"Chassid Sorfon\") remain unchanged, some of the externals have changed.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This ended up a lot longer than I had originally intended, but what I've mentioned is really only a snippet of the larger effect of Chassidus. </p>\n\n<p>For more information on this, I suggest listening or reading the beginning of \"Inyana Shel Toras HaChassidus, available as an <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/1036483/jewish/On-the-Essence-of-Chassidus.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">audio lecture</a> (thanks @mochin rechavim) or <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/15729\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrew/English PDF</a>. This is geared towards Toras HaChassidus (specifically as taught by Chabad), but starts from the Baal Shem Tov.</p>\n\n<p>For a more general history of the time, and the effects that Chassidus hoped to have (and had), as well as the fundamentals (rather than the externals) of Chassidus, I very strongly suggest Rabbi Yossi Paltiel's Shiurim <a href=\"http://insidechassidus.org/thought-and-history/22-what-is-chassidus.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. (Again, it's from the perspective of Chabad, but he goes through all the history.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You seem to be confusing Buber's neo-Chassidism and Carlebach's kiruv-Chassidism with actual Chassidism.  Both of these authors had an agenda of advertising a secularized version of chassidism to their followers.  Original Chassidism was more about adding on to existing Jewish practice by providing commoners with something that they could connect outside of simple Torah study. They had the same, if not greater emphasis on practical observance, with the main differences being in the extent of their focus on prayer and the centrality of mystical 'rebbes' who were (/are) believed to be miracle workers and spiritual mediums. </p>\n\n<p>Sources: </p>\n\n<p>Mainly personal experience - readings and lectures over the years and such, but for quick reference here are some relevant wikipedia articles:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber#Hasidism_and_mysticism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber#Hasidism_and_mysticism</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism</a></p>\n\n\n",

I know people who will only eat Chassidisher Shchita, some will only eat meat that was shechted by Shochtim <em>from their Chassidus</em>, some will not eat meat outside their house (while they will eat other products), etc. These are people that will eat national hashgachos for most items.</p>\n\n<p>These people can't consider non-Chassidim to be <em>like a mumar lechol Hatorah</em> as if they were, they couldn't rely on their Hashgachos at all (and wouldn't be able to eat anything with an O-U, etc.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am looking for <em>sources</em> (such as, Shulchan Aruch demands ..., Simla Chadasha demands etc.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>My rebbi in הלכות שחיטה told me that chassidishe שחיטה used to mean that the שוחט had special intent to release the גלגול in the animal and/or to release the inherent spark נצוצות that are in every thing, but eventually that knowledge got lost even to the חסידים (as far as most people know), and now it is only a remembrance to that earlier time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The technicalities of shechitah create a very fine line between a kosher shechitah and one that results in neveila meat. For example, applying too much downward pressure on the knife, or pausing during the procedure, can totally invalidate the shechitah. It is basically the shochet's call as to whether the necessary parameters were fulfilled. However, the shochet obviously has a bias to pronounce his work kosher, especially in large commercial productions where a high failure rate could cost him his job. It requires a certain amount of Yiras Shamayim on the shochet's part to make an honest assessment of his shechitah. Hence the focus on a shochet's affiliation, which makes people more comfortable about his probable level of Yiras Shomayim. (Whether this is justified or not is a separate issue.) Additionally, as mentioned by Issac Moses, customs vary (sometimes in a significant ways) from community to community.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>While I'm late to this discussion, I'd like to straighten out and clarify the issues involved. There are a number of matters here:</p>\n\n<p>1) Yiras Shamayim. This requirement in a shochet predates chasidism by a long time, and is quite mainstream. Here is a quote from Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%97#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.99.D7.96\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 18:17</a>):</p>\n\n<p><strong>טבח שלא הראה סכינו לחכם</strong> (ונמצאת יפה)<strong>, היו מנדין אותו</strong>. ואם נמצאת פגומה, מנדין אותו ומעבירין אותו. ובנמצאת יפה, יכול החכם למחול ואין צריך לנדותו. <strong>והאידנא נהגו למנות אנשים ידועים על השחיטה והבדיקה, ולהם מחלו חכמים כבודם, כי הם זהירים וזריזים, והרבה צריך ישוב הדעת ויראת שמים לבדיקת הסכין, הלא תראה כי יבדוק אדם פעמים שלש ולא ירגיש בפגימה דקה ואחר כך ימצאנה כי הכין לבו באחרונה, ובחינת חוש המישוש כפי כוונת הלב.</strong></p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/ka5/18/10.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>2) So-called chasidic shechita. This originally was a question of forged vs. molten steel. Rabbis in the new chasidic community maintained that forged steel was unfit and that molten steel was superior, while mitnagdim and their Rabbis took great offense at the suggestion. Thus, chasidim had to rely on known chasidic shochtim if they wanted to adhere to the chasidic standard. This detail is no longer relevant as this standard has long become mainstream. See <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3aQvFG3-Xip94J%3awww.chabadlibrary.org/shiurim/3/shiur249.doc%20&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for a historic overview.</p>\n\n<p>3) Avoiding non-chasidic shechita. Interestingly, the baal ha'Tanya, probably the first authority to go on record and advocate extensively for the so-called chasidic knives, categorically asserts that it would be unthinkable to invalidate 'traditional' shechita on this basis (see previous link):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם לפעמים מסובים בסעודת מצוה עם אנשי עירם, חלילה לפרוש מהם להחזיקם\n  כאוכלי נבלות ח\"ו, הס מלהזכיר, ומעודי לא נזהרתי מהכלים אף מבני יומן.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מ\"ש כבוד תורתם שנאמר להם בשמי על שחיטה שלהם שאינה בכשרות ח\"ו, חלילה\n  חלילה לי להוציא דבה על עם ה' רבבות אלפי ישראל, ונאמן עלי אבא שבשמים,\n  וגם יעידו עלי כל המקורבים אלי, כי אינני נזהר מעולם מכלים אפילו הם בני\n  יומן.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, note the emphasis in the first letter on the 'occasional'.</p>\n\n<p>4) Sticking to one's community. I imagine the issue here is not specifically a chasidic one at all. To oversimplify: communities used to be defined by geography. Jews living in X were X, those living in Y were Y. Every city had its demographics, its Rabbinate, and its shechita. With the advent of chasidism certain cities may have split in half, but the geographic boundaries persisted. This meant that a given city's shechita (or shechitos) belonged to, and was controlled by, solely itself/ves. If someone from 'out of town' would attempt to encroach on any community's shechita, he would be deemed an interloper, a מסיג גבול, and be excommunicated and run out of town. Today, many Jews, especially chasidim, still define themselves by European geography, and organize their communities in similar fashion. Thus, sticking to one's own community's shechita is more of an expression of a protective, exclusionary sentiment than a purely religious concern about kashrut.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDITION:</strong> 5) Difference between shechita and ordinary hashgacha. Here are my thoughts: a) The notion of Chasidic/community kashrus originated in Europe when the only kashrus job was shechita; applying the yiras shamayim/community argument here should necessitate similar standards for hashgacha, but perhaps this is an example of the original logic being abandoned and forgotten when the reality changes. b1) In terms of yiras shamayim, Shechita is the only instance where the act itself establishes the kashrus, whereas one could argue that all other areas of hashgacha are more about ensuring the lack of something unkosher occurring; those spiritually inclined could therefore argue that the impact of the shochet on the souls of those eating his food is profound to a much greater degree than anyone else involved in food production. b2) The laws arising every day in the slaughterhouse are more complex and costly than those typically arising in other areas of food production. b3) There may be certain chumros unique to shechita unique to each community as opposed to other areas of kashrus. c) Chasidic communities large enough to maintain their own shechita usually operate their own hechsher as well, and thus it’s possible that these communities do in fact tend to rely on their own kashrus where essential foodstuffs are concerned. d) Operating purely based on the ‘community’ explanation, one could argue that the same right that grants each community the power to preserve the strength of its shechita, allows for the relaxation of that power should they so desire it; thus, these communities apparently decided to maintain their grasp on shechita but willfully chose to allow for other kashrus powers to overlap with theirs where practically necessitated.</p>\n\n\n",

This would be useful when determining how much is needed to eat to make a <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos7_29.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">blessing over the hand washing</a>, and say the Grace After Meals.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example which focuses on the volume, but the same question would apply to weight if the igredients were weighed instead of measured by volume. For the sake of simplicity we'll assume that all parts get distributed equally:</p>\n\n<p>I adapted <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_5265248_make-excellent-tortillas-scratch.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this recipe</a> to make 8 equal size flour tortillas. Here is the recipe I used. I used <a href=\"http://www.calculateme.com/Volume/Cups/ToCubicCentimeters.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this website</a> to convert the cups to cubic centimeters, and put the number in parenthesis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups of flour (<strong>473.1764725</strong> Cubic Centimeters)</li>\n<li>a dash of baking powder</li>\n<li>1/2 a cup of oil (<strong>118.29411812499998</strong> Cubic Centimeters)</li>\n<li>3/4 of a cup of water (<strong>177.4411771875</strong> Cubic Centimeters)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/pesach/pes62-yr.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>, R' Avraham Chaim Na'eh holds that the stricter definition of a K'zayit is <strong>27 cubic centimeters</strong>, while the Chazon Ish holds that it is <strong>47.5 cubic centimeters</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So my question now is, can I add up all the cubic centimeters used in the recipe, divide by 8 and use that information to determine how much of the tortilla is a K'zayit? If I add it all up, the recipe calls for a total of <strong>768.911768</strong> cubic centimeters. This means that each tortilla uses <strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=473.1764725/8&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#hl=en&client=ubuntu&channel=fs&sclient=psy-ab&q=%28473.1764725%2b118.29411812499998%2b177.4411771875%29/8&oq=%28473.1764725%2b118.29411812499998%2b177.4411771875%29/8&aq=f&aqi=h1&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=5152l16815l2l18202l4l4l0l0l0l0l238l920l2-4l4l0&gs_l=serp.3..19.5152l16815l2l18203l4l4l0l0l0l0l238l920l2-4l4l0.frgbld.&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=7dfa92a487c36218&biw=1280&bih=615\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">96.113971</a></strong> cubic centimeters of ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Can I therefore say that one tortilla is 2 K'zaytim according to the Chazon Ish, and 3.5 K'zaytim according to R' Avraham Chaim Na'eh? Is this a valid halachic way to determine the volume of a food item, or are there other factors that must be taken into account?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I propose that that is <em>not</em> a valid method to measure volume for purposes of <em>b'racha acharona</em> for foods generally, though I can't speak to its applicability to tortillas specifically. Here's a counterexample to show its inapplicability in general: coffee, brewed in a stovetop percolator. Put whatever quantity of coffee grounds and water in the percolator, turn on the gas, and wait. The coffee (and grounds) that come out will be considerably less than what went in. Yet search as you might on Google, there are many who discuss how much coffee must be drunk to require a <em>b'racha acharona</em>, but no one seems to take into account the amount of water put into the percolator: they all measure the amount actually drunk. This is not a great proof (<em>lo rainu eno r'aya</em>), but it's somewhat indicative.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The question seems to be mixing up three different issues.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How much of a raw ingredient is needed to \"tithe\" (take halah, trumah or meiser)</li>\n<li>How much food needs to be eaten for a certain bracha.</li>\n<li>How to measure or decide if the amount of food needed fulfills the halachic requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While issue 3 is a matter of great halachic debate, issues 1 and 2 are not debated at all.\nIssue 1 has straight forward \"amounts\" in the halacha.  Whether or not you fulfill those amounts is dedpendant on issue 3.\nIssue 2 however is the main question that you ask here, and all agree that to figure out if you need to make certain brachot, the question is how much went into your mouth.\nThe only way to figure out how many beitzot or kzayit are needed for a bracha is to measure the food that you have eaten.  If you know for certain how the food shrinks or grows based on your ingredients, then perhaps you could figure it out from ingredients alone, but that seems much more difficult than just measuring and weighing a single tortilla and figuring out it's size and weight.</p>\n\n\n",

As aroma is all important to the resulting flavor of the coffee, most manufacturers will spray a coffee oil on the powder to add back some of the lost aroma. This is known as aromatizing. In another attempt to make the instant coffee as much like real ground coffee as possible, the powder is put through a heating process which causes it to clump. It is then ground to resemble real ground coffee. This is called agglomeration.</p>\n<p>Freeze Drying - Freeze dried coffee is produced by freezing liquid coffee and then placing the product under a vacuum enabling the frozen liquid to vaporize without passing through the liquid phase.

Did they know it referred to an impending Babylonian exile, just not know when it would be? Did they think it was metaphoric, referring to other things entirely? Did they think it was referring to a Babylonian exile, but one which (they thought) had been averted? Did they look at it and not have any idea what it meant?

Nowadays, when a kippa has become the symbol of an Orthodox Jew, I could see how some may compare hiding it to מושך עורלתו- someone who covers up his Berit Mila because he is ashamed to be in a covenant with God, which is a very serious offense (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1503.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Teshuva 3:6</a>), but I don't think that <em>Halachically</em> it can be classified as such, considering that <em>Halachically</em> it doesn't represent a Jew, the way a Berit Mila does. </p>\n\n<p>(I think that it goes without saying, though, that CYLOR is pretty applicable here.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>HaRav Haim Levi Shelit\"a (Anshe Hayil 1:55) says hats count for a head covering.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have been told that the head should be covered at all times.

If you are afraid of looking like a Jew by wearing a Kippah and wish to trade it for a hat in public then I would advise against the hat and go talk with your Rabbi. \nSome places of work will not allow Kippah (Mining, construction, etc...)

    "content": "# Why, in double parshiyos, are the aliyos not simply combined in pairs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Consider for example the double parshah Vayakhel-Pekudei. The aliyos from the two individual parshiyos are combined as follows: 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3. (Meaning: the first two aliyos are combined into one, then the next three are combined into the next aliyah, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Why not just combine each pair of aliyos from the separate parshiyos into one? (As far as I know, the only pair in which this is done consistently is Acharei Mos-Kedoshim.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>[Not really an answer, but some random stuff I found and some general impressions.]</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan writes (OC 282:12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המנהג הפשוט כששני סדרות מחוברות קורא הרביעי סוף פרשה ראשונה ותחלה שנייה כדי שהשבעה קרואים יהיו שוים בשתי הסדרות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When dividing up the aliyot of a double parsha, one should make the fourth aliya straddle the border so that each parasha gets half the aliyot. He quotes a discussion in the Levush what to do if one adds on to the seven aliyot: the Levush feels that the extras should be split between each parsha to keep the count even; the AH feels we only count the main seven in regards to an even split (he proves this from maftir).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I note also that the Temanim always make Chamishi of a combined parsha start at the beginning of the second parsha. You can see there chumash <a href=\"http://www.nosachteiman.co.il/?CategoryID=583&ArticleID=2889&Page=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. It seems to me looking through some of the Temani splits that they take advantage of the sparsity of aliyot to try and place them only at the 'better' stopping places, usually the parshiyot petuchot and setumot. I assume they feel that a Weekly Parsha (sedra) break is even stronger than a regular parsha (parshiya) break and that's why they always guarantee an aliya stop there.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't know if you're going to find a rule that covers all the different parshiyot. But there are some of the choices that make some sense. Consider the first three aliyot in Netzavim: the first two are quite short while the third is long. Presumably this is because the third has some negative content and we don't want to stop in the middle, but we need 7 stops, so we squeeze them at the beginning. When we have a double parsha, those will be the first to go. Similar considerations can explain the breakup of the beginning and end of Bechukotai, with the Tochecha causing a problem for aliyot. Finally, I think that the placement of combined-5 in Masei is there to avoid breaking up the list of the journeys, and a similar explanation can be given as to why combined-3 is at regular-6 not regular-5 of Mattot (assuming an a priori standard of 2-2-2-2-2-2-2).</p>\n\n<p>Other than that I think it's just Minhag Avoteinu that developed somewhat out of concern for length and context. The aliya breaks as we have are a relatively recent phenomenon and I don't know that we can expect the process to have happened under the rigid oversight of an organizer. It's simply Tradition!</p>\n\n\n",

And indeed this verse is a direct continuation of that chapter, because Yehoshua didn't manage to smite the five cities of the Plishtim, and only in the time of the judges did Shimshon manage to smite Azah and Ashkelon, and in the time of Shmuel Hashem smote Ashdod, Gat and Ekron.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Zisberg in his essay \"<a href=\"http://www.machonso.org/uploads/images/215-12%2057-68.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שלושים ואחד המלכים - רשימה או שירה?</a>\", Hamaayan 215, pg. 67-68, suggests that perhaps it's the other way around: The song of the five seranim came to emphasize that since for a short time, the Plishtim recognized Hashem as the one true God, they merited to stay alive, unlike the Canaanite kings who didn't recognize Hashem and were therefore destroyed.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Zisberg's suggestion might serve to explain the difference in the poetic scheme between the two songs (though lacking understanding in the subject, I can't say why it makes more sense that one is \"natural\" and the other not).</p>\n\n\n",

We thus find, \"His eyes shall see (<em>ye-chezu</em>), his eyelids shall discern the children of man\" (Psalms 11:4). This teaches that God's eyes and eyelids know people's deeds and nothing is hidden from them. That is why the chest (<em>chazeh</em>) is waved in all four directions: east, west, north, and south.

Your main question as to the reasoning behind <em>kitniyot</em> is brought up in the <em>Mishna Berurah</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Mishnah Berurah (453:6 & 464:5) cites three reasons for the minhag\n  (a) kitniyot is harvested and processed in the same manner as chametz,\n  (b) it is ground into flour and baked just like chametz [so people may\n  mistakenly believe that if they can eat kitniyot, they can also eat\n  chametz], ( c ) it may have chametz grains mixed into it [so people\n  who eat kitniyot may inadvertently be eating chametz]. Although\n  initially there were those who objected to the minhag, it has become\n  an accepted part of Pesach in all Ashkenazic communities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As regards peanuts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Iggeros Moshe (O.C. III:63) assumes that peanuts are not kitniyot but\n  notes that some have a custom to be machmir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>Igros Moshe</em> notes that this is a matter of minhag within a community and that as long as something has not previously been considered <em>kitniyot</em>, it will not be <em>added</em> to the list. However, those that have a minhag to treat something as <em>kitniyot</em> should continue to do so (as an example, peanuts).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Iggeros Moshe explains that the minhag to not eat kitniyot developed\n  differently than other minhagim and therefore rules that only foods\n  which we know were specifically included in the minhag are forbidden.\n  [See also Chok Yaakov 453:9 who makes a similar point]. With this he\n  explains the generally accepted custom to not consider potatoes to be\n  kitniyot even though logically they should be, as follows: the minhag\n  of kitniyot can be dated back at least until Maharil, who died in\n  1427, and potatoes didn’t come to Europe until the 16th century, so\n  potatoes were a “new” vegetable which wasn’t included in the minhag.\n  An important “exception” to the aforementioned rule that “new”\n  vegetables aren’t included in the minhag, is corn/maize which Mishnah\n  Berurah 453:4 and others rule is kitniyot even though it was\n  introduced to Europe after the minhag had already begun.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a rule, spices are not considered to be kitniyot and Rema 453:1\n  makes a point of noting that anise/dill and coriander are not\n  kitniyot. Taz 462:3 notes that all spices should be checked before\n  Pesach to establish that no chametz-grains are mixed in, and elsewhere\n  Taz (453:1) specifically notes that anise and coriander seeds should\n  be thoroughly checked. In addition, Taz and Magen Avraham (453:3)\n  discuss whether fennel, cumin and caraway seeds (i.e. three variations\n  of “Kimmel” ) can possibly be checked (and used) for Pesach. Thus, as\n  a rule, spices are not kitniyot but require special care to guarantee\n  that no chametz-grains are mixed into them. Some hashgochos consider\n  fenugreek to be kitniyot while others do not, and the surprising\n  ramifications of this question will be noted towards the end of the\n  article.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The assumption of this point is that had they actually been chametz, they would have been permitted despite tasting exactly like matza. So your chametz-crackers are permitted.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: In his footnotes to the Mishna Berura (published as ביצחק יקרא), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Nebenzahl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Nevenzhal</a> says that the matza sold year round as chametz should not be eaten on Erev Pesach even before the fourth hour as it might actually be kosher matza and therefore forbbidden. He does not mention if this chumra (that it might not be chametz) applies going back to Rosh Chodesh, or only on Erev Pesach when the possible prohibition is rabbinic in nature.</p>\n\n\n",

If anything, on Shabbos there should be a bigger Hetter to comb, as one needs a Meleches Machsheves to be considered Mechalel Shabbos. Yet, it is considered to be a psik reisha that one will pull out hairs.

His main argument, or that of his sources, is that  depilatory paste would violate both giluach (shaving) and hashchasa (destruction) of the hair.

Tweezers do not have the ability to remove hair, they just grab the hair while you pluck it out.</p>\n<p>We can apply this logic to combs as well.

No kometz (handful) was taken from such menachos (see Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=8&hilchos=47&perek=18&halocha=8&hilite=\">Hil.

(With private menachos, on the other hand, the ratio was 1/10 eifah flour (7.2 log) to 1 log oil, which would probably make for a pretty stiff dough.)</p>\n\n<p>There is also the case where the kometz of a regular minchah gets mixed up with a minchas nesachim (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=22&format=pdf\">Menachos 22a</a>), where R. Yehudah points out that \"they absorb [oil] from each other\" - and Rashi there (ד\"ה והן בולעות) notes that it's not really \"each other,\" rather that the kometz will absorb oil from the minchas nesachim. This also suggests that the latter is more crumbly (or perhaps, as yitznewton said, batter-y), otherwise the oil wouldn't be wicked up out of it so easily.</p>\n\n\n",

Give them some suggestions - let them pick out which they want to do.</p>\n\n<h3>Skit</h3>\n\n<p>A skit/play/show/whatever-you-want-to-call-it is a classic. Suggested topics include slavery, the plagues, the exodus itself, or (often) all together.</p>\n\n<p>This can be successful, but it has to be done properly. A short one is best. Last year i really overdid it, and nobody was really interested. Keep it in the 5-10 minute range.</p>\n\n<p>The best time for this is Shulchan Orech. This way, the adults can eat while they watch the play. The kids will often be (nearly) full from the matzah, maror, koreich, egg, and kneidlach, so this is a good way to keep them occupied for the rest of the meal.<br>\nMaggid might sound like a good idea (we <em>are</em> discussing it), but it isn't, unless you want your seder lasting until dawn...</p>\n\n<h3>Afikoman Treasure Hunt</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, you read that right! Instead of plain old hide-and-seek for the afikoman, let's spice it up a little. I came up with the idea last year, and it went over extremely well.</p>\n\n<p>It's pretty simple to do. Just come up with some clues leading to locations around the house. At the last one, hide the afikoman. I added a bit of an extra dimension by having all of the clues together add up to one final clue.</p>\n\n<h3>Songs/Poems</h3>\n\n<p>There are numerous songs and poems written for the seder. <a href=\"http://www.jewishfood-list.com/komedy/4quesdrseuss01.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Dr. Seuss Four Questions</a> is an old favorite. So is <a href=\"http://www.jewishhumorcentral.com/2013/03/dont-sit-on-afikoman-singalong-fun-for.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Don't Sit on the Afikoman</em></a>. We've tried a bunch of the ones from <a href=\"http://holidays.juda.com/passover-songs.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a>; most of them are cute once, but not lasting for year after year.</p>\n\n<h3>Divrei Torah + Questions</h3>\n\n<p>The above things are good for making the seder fun and interesting.

    "content": "# Seder advice when with people who aren't interested?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This may have some things in common with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15278/472\">beginner's seder advice</a>, but it's different enough that I'm asking separately.</p>\n\n<p>For family-obligation reasons, I sometimes find myself at a seder where most of the people are not interested in the religious content -- the seder to them is a family reuinion with traditional elements.  (I've already tried \"let's get together on day 3 instead\"; won't fly.)  These are people who identify culturally but not religiously -- but they value home-based rituals for the sake of the ritual itself.  All of the attendees are teens or adults.</p>\n\n<p>I have already (mostly) found ways to fulfill my own halachic obligations in such a setting (helped by long-running meals).  What, if anything, can I do to liven up this kind of seder and pique others' interest?</p>\n\n<p>Should I bring midrashim that aren't in the haggadah (maybe people like stories)?  Should I ask questions (that I'm prepared to then answer if needed) about the haggadah?  Can I somehow make the theme of redemption more personal, in a way they could relate to?  (How?)</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to be seen as \"preaching\" but I would like to find a way to improve the situation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>A few ideas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get into \"round-table\" discussions related to the Exodus somehow, in which everyone is encouraged to voice their opinions on the subject at hand. For example, citing the midrash about how the redemption was deserved by the Jews for not changing their \"Jewish\" attire and names can incite a socio-historical discussion about the role of assimilation in Jewish history. The ten plagues can incite a philosophical discussion about Pharaoh's free will. The passage about God directly redeeming the Jews (not by angel or messenger) can incite a theological discussion about God's providential role in general. There are so many topics one can relate to the haggada, and sometimes you'd be surprised at who has strong opinions about certain subjects.</li>\n<li>A lot of singing. People who attend the seder for ritualistic purposes often want to hear the \"classic traditional\" songs (i.e. <em>\"Ha lachma anya\", \"Mah Nishtana\", \"Avadim Hayinu\", \"Dayenu\"</em> etc.) Find someone with a voice who knows the tunes and have him/her lead the singing.</li>\n<li>For those who get bored in the middle, have the table sprinkled with stuff to do, like those kind of trinket-puzzles that can take time to solve, or little toys that are fun to play with. (You'd be surprised how much stuff you can find that can be indirectly \"passover-related\", e.g. pyramid puzzles, hopping frogs, wind-up locusts, etc.) This usually works to occupy kids and even bored adults.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Strangely enough, I have found that those who aren't interested will tend to go with the flow if you state from the outset that you're going to read through the Hagadah. It will be dry. It may be boring. But if they are mature enough (not particularly opposed to ritual, and your question implies that they are not), just give everyone a Hagadah and say you're going to go around the table and everyone will read a paragraph or two, and they should be willing to do that as a ritual. The dipping, <s>the wine,</s>* the Matzah, the Maror, etc., may not interest them, but you can fulfill your obligations with those easily without their cooperation, and who doesn't like to sing Mah NiShtana and Dayenu and harken back to their old beloved (beloathed?) Hebrew school days?</p>\n\n<p>I think long-winded Divrei Torah will probably not go over well, and over the top shtick would probably be too much of a distraction and lead to the end of any hope of getting back to the program.</p>\n\n<p>But, if everyone is respectful and well behaved, I wouldn't be too surprised if they'll go along with the \"let's all take turns reading\" approach. They might not get through the entire thing, and you may find yourself reading the rest on your own during dinner, but give it a shot and see how far you can get with them.</p>\n\n<p>*They'll probably go for the wine if you get something nice. ;-)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 11)\n\n<p><strong>Report</strong></p>\n\n<p>This \"answer\" records what I did this year and how it worked out.  I drew from several suggestions in other answers here.</p>\n\n<p>Some context: the two seders had different but overlapping groups of attendees.  One has always been a \"when do we eat?\" seder; the other spends more time but replaces a lot of the traditional content with other readings and songs (mostly Zionist).  It was hard to get the leaaders of the former to pause for any discussion, though we had some brief conversations farther down the table and a little during the meal.  The other one ended up having better prospects.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Eytan Yammer suggested:  <em>Go around the table and have everyone finish a sentence \"slavery is...\" \"freedom is...\"</em></p>\n\n<p>This idea really appeals to me.  It makes it personal.  I recast this as: Pesach is about freedom.  We can be free <em>from</em> things and we can be free <em>to do</em> things.  How are we free this year?\"</p>\n\n<p>What I learned: I think this would work well for a seder with friends, but the idea fell flat with a group of relatives who are there because you're expected to be there.  This idea felt awkward to the people I proposed it to before the seder and I did not pursue it further.  I will use this idea in other seder settings in the future.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Jake suggested: <em>Get into \"round-table\" discussions related to the Exodus somehow, in which everyone is encouraged to voice their opinions on the subject at hand.</em></p>\n\n<p>This worked, albeit not in the way I anticipated.  I went prepared with ideas to throw out for discussion and people didn't much take the bait -- <em>but</em> it led to <em>them</em> asking questions, and once it wasn't coming from the most religious person at the table it worked well.  The conversations were not necessarily deep, but people asked questions and offered answers -- score.  (During the hurried seder when I saw somebody trying to speak I directly encouraged that person to ask his question -- if not then, then the following night.  This happened.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Seth J suggested (in a comment): <em>have everyone go around the room reading and following the Haggadah for as long as everyone seems willing/able to pay attention.</em></p>\n\n<p>This practice naturally arose at one seder (the latter one) and had to be pushed a little harder with the other.  Sharing the reading increased participation (and that's a keeper); some people, however, read as quickly as they could to get it over with.  Perhaps an explicit invitation to pass if you must (but we'd really like you to read) would address this.</p>\n\n<p>Seth also suggested good wine: check. :-)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Eytan said: <em>when you prepare think of questions more than answers.</em></p>\n\n<p>Yes.  Questions invited discussion, and a lot of them came back to people looking to me for answers but that has a very different dynamic than offering a d'var up front.  (And none of my answers were long.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Jake suggested more singing.  One of the two seders is usually fairly musical and the other not; I was able to help both of them do more music by the simple expedient of just started to sing (rather than waiting for consensus to arise).  It probably helps that I have a pretty good voice (at least according to the other attendees).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I did not get to try Eytan's suggestions about art or personalized readings, nor Jake's and Gershon's suggestions about table toys/puzzles.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anything I could do to prompt other people to ask questions -- planting ideas, reaching out to hesitant people, helping side/dinner conversations happen -- worked well.  Asking questions about the text, the haggadah, etc worked; asking people to personalize it did not work in this setting (but would in others).</p>\n\n<p>Coming prepared to present material was not needed, or helpful.  People didn't want unsolicited teaching, but answers to their questions are completely different.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing the reading among willing participants worked; pushing people who don't want to read to read led to rushed, mumbled reading, not engagement.</p>\n\n<p>Singing worked well, and it was ok to just jump in and not wait for permission.</p>\n\n<p>In the future I hope to build on this foundation.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, in setting up the lunch, I would order in some kosher food and set up a separate table for it, making sure it's well-labelled.  This might be enough to entice the people who don't keep kosher to eat the kosher food, because they didn't have to make special arrangements.  (If you're not already confident in your observance or aspirations of observance, it can be very hard to make that request for accommodation.  But if the food's right there in front of you...)  For the travel arrangements, I would first present itineraries that don't involve travel on Shabbat/Yom Tov and see if they're acceptable.  There's not much you can do if the timing of the meeting/conference/whatever itself violates halacha, unfortunately, but in that case you're not the one placing the stumbling-block.</p>\n\n<p>(I was once sent to a summer conference that started on a Sunday morning.  At that company employees proposed itineraries for approval.  My submission of a flight on Friday afternoon raised eyebrows, but there were no Saturday-night flights that would get me there in time.  I pointed out that the extra two hotel nights were less expensive than the difference in airfares (Saturday stay-over being a big deal at the time) and they agreed.  I went to Chabad for Shabbat meals.  I mention this to illustrate that even if candidate travel arrangements seem like they would be rejected by the corporate powers that be, it's worth asking.  For persuading the employee who'll be doing the travel, you'll probably need to point out some other reasons that spending extra time at the destination is attractive; nobody wants to just sit in a hotel room for an extra day.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I know of a mechanic that has many non religious workers. He has instituted that no one is allowed to bring his own lunch, and he supplies lunch daily for all his workers. In addition he has them wash and then Bentch together. (no one stands with a gun to their head, it is done and those that want to, participate)</p>\n\n<p>I know this does not exactly answer your question, however this idea may help you think of other ideas how to work out such situations. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Yoreh Deah 151:4, the Rama quotes the Mordechai that it is permissible to sell objects of idol worship to a non-Jew if the non-Jew can obtain objects of idol worship through other means anyway. He also quotes a few other sources that disagree, though he writes that the practice is to be lenient. The Shach (s\"k 6 and quoted in Beer Heitev s\"k 5) writes that even the stringent authorities quoted by the Rama agree with the Mordechai. However, the Shach there explains that to a Jew it is nevertheless forbidden; see there. However, he writes that for a mumar, he counts as a non-Jew. But also see the Dagul MeRevavah that a Jewish mumar has the law of an ordinary Jew.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to correspond to your first two cases. We would say that according to everyone, you can't give a Jew non-kosher food. However, from the Shach (not like the Dagul Merevavah), it appears that for a mumar it is permissible. What is a mumar? Does it have to be someone who worships idols, or can it even be someone who is mechalel shabbos befarhesiya (publicly)? I don't know. Although the Kitzur (72:2) writes that whoever desecrates Shabbos in public is like an oved kochavim for every matter, the Shearim Metzuyanim Bahalachah there says that this is only lechumrah; but if treating him as an oved kochavim would lead to a kula — as in your case — he counts as an ordinary Jew.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning the third question, the Shu\"T Teshuvos VeHanhagos (pt. 1 siman 283) writes that it is forbidden, in contradiction to the Igros Mosheh (OC pt. 3 siman 36) which he quotes there.</p>\n\n\n",

In turn the\n  Canaanite languages are a branch of the Northwest Semitic family of\n  languages.[4] Hebrew flourished as a spoken language in the kingdoms\n  of Israel and Judah during the 10th to 7th centuries BCE. Scholars\n  debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient\n  times following the Babylonian exile, when the predominant language in\n  the region was Old Aramaic. Hebrew was nearly extinct as a spoken\n  language by Late Antiquity, but it continued to be used as a literary\n  language and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various\n  dialects of literary Medieval Hebrew, until its revival as a spoken\n  language in the late 19th century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rashi (to Bereishis 2:23) notes that the world was created in Hebrew.

They all seem to be based around the same signs, even if there are nuances between various methods.

He describes (in my own very loose translation and sometimes condensation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Rabat, Morocco, the Torah reader himself moved his right hand or his head when reading words with <em>mafsik</em> (pausal) cantillation. That is, the motions constituted an \"accompaniment\":<br>\n  <strong>zarka</strong> – he moves his head leftward<br>\n  <strong>s'golta</strong>, <strong>zakef katon</strong>, <strong>asnach</strong>, <strong>sof pasuk</strong> – the index finger is situated on the table vertically; the other fingers form a fist<br>\n  <strong>pazer gadol</strong>, <strong>karne fara</strong>, <strong>sh'ne g'rishin</strong>, <strong>shalsheles</strong> – he lifts his hand above his shoulder; the index finger is extended and the other fingers are in a fist<br>\n  <strong>talsha</strong> – some (not all) make a circle with the hand, with the hand at shoulder-height<br>\n  <strong>azla g'rish</strong> – he moves his head leftward and then rightward (back and forth)<br>\n  <strong>r'via</strong> – he moves his hand downward (one movement)<br>\n  <strong>kadma</strong> – he lifts his index finger a little upward. (It's the identical sign as for <em>pazer</em> except that he lifts the finger less than to shoulder-height.)<br>\n  <strong>zakef gadol</strong> – he shakes his head down-up-down (three movements)<br>\n  <strong>t'vir</strong> – the palm is open and is moved on a slant downward to the left to the table  </p>\n  \n  <p>In Fez, Morocco, they practiced two sets of motions. One was \"accompaniment\" of the head by the reader himself. The other set was done only when the reader was inexpert in the cantillation: then the \"<em>somech</em>\", standing to his left, helped him with \"assisting\" signs executed with the right hand or both hands. The assisting motions were not done simultaneous with the reading, as the accompaniment was, but beforehand, so the reader would know what cantillation was coming up. The use of assisting motions is disliked and generally unused, but is used freely in teaching cantillation to children.<br>\n  <strong>zarka</strong> – the index finger is extended and the others form a fist. Move the hand upward slowly. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> the reader moves his head downward; some also raise their eyebrows.<br>\n  <strong>s'golta</strong> – After raising the hand for <em>zarka</em>, lower the palm. At the end, the palm is open and not resting on the table.<br>\n  <strong>pazer</strong> – Move the hand slowly leftward once. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> turn the head in small circles.<br>\n  <strong>talsha</strong> and <strong>karne fara</strong> – the <em>somech</em> draws circles in the air until the reader starts reading the <em>talsha</em>. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> arcing rightward.<br>\n  <strong>azla g'rish</strong> – the <em>somech</em> lifts both hands in parallel (each finger opposite its mate), and bends the fingers inward (thereby indicating the Tiberian symbol). <em>Head accompaniment:</em> move the head leftward, then rightward.<br>\n  <strong>pasek</strong> – as for <em>zarka</em> but faster. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> suddenly lifting the head.<br>\n  <strong>r'via</strong> – the hand is at shoulder height and the index finger is turned slowly slightly backward toward the shoulder. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> turn the head slowly to the right.<br>\n  <strong>kadma</strong> – the hand is at shoulder height and is moved leftward to be at the base of the throat. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> turn the head down and leftward (similar to the hand motion).<br>\n  <strong>zakef katon</strong> – from the end of the <em>hadma</em> sign, the hand is then moved slowly to rightward. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> move the head downward.<br>\n  <strong>zakef gadol</strong> – the palm is open and moves upward slowly. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> move the head downward.<br>\n  <strong>shalsheles</strong> – a slow arc rightward. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> an arc rightward.<br>\n  <strong>sh'ne g'rishin</strong> – standing the index and middle fingers connected (like the Tiberian symbol)<br>\n  <strong>darga</strong> – the palm is opposite the middle of the chest and lifts until it's at shoulder height and on the <em>somech</em>'s right side.<br>\n  <strong>t'vir</strong> – opposite hand motion to that of <em>darga</em>. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> move the head downward.<br>\n  <strong>maarich</strong>, <strong>tarcha</strong>, <strong>asnach</strong> – the <em>somech</em> shows the symbols at [the height he's at already?]. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> none.<br>\n  <strong>y'siv</strong> – the palm is opposite the middle of the chest and moves fast rightward. <em>Head accompaniment:</em> none.<br>\n  <strong>sof pasuk</strong> – lift the extended palm slightly.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Djerba, a \"<em>masmich</em>\" would aid the reader by putting his right-hand fingers on the reader's back (near his left shoulder) during the reading; this is still done in the Djerba synagogue in Jerusalem. Another informant says that to teach children the reading, a teacher would use his right hand as follows:<br>\n  <strong>zarka</strong> – with the index finger extended and the others in a fist, make three or four fast clockwise circles<br>\n  <strong>s'golta</strong> – vertical motion<br>\n  <strong>pazer gadol</strong>, <strong>zakef gadol</strong> – slow upward motion<br>\n  <strong>talsha</strong>, <strong>karne fara</strong> – slow clockwise circles<br>\n  <strong>azla g'rish</strong> – with the index finger extended and the others in a fist, make the <em>azla</em> shape twice, slowly<br>\n  <strong>pasek</strong> – a fast right-and-upward motion (with the index finger extended and the others in a fist)<br>\n  <strong>r'via</strong> – like for <em>pazer</em> but faster<br>\n  <strong>kadma</strong> – like for <em>s'golta</em> but shorter<br>\n  <strong>zakef katon</strong>, <strong>darga</strong>, <strong>t'vir</strong>, <strong>asnach</strong>, <strong>sof pasuk</strong> – like for <em>s'golta</em> but slower<br>\n  <strong>shalsheles</strong> – with the index finger extended and the others in a fist, make two slow circles and then throw the hand upward fast<br>\n  <strong>sh'ne g'rishin</strong> – with the index finger extended and the others in a fist, make two slow circles</p>\n  \n  <p>The ancient community of Rome:<br>\n  <strong>mercha-tip'cha-esnach/sof pasuk</strong> – the open hand, palm down, is placed on the back of the reader's hand as he points to the words<br>\n  <strong>mahpach-pashta-munach-zakef katon</strong> – the open hand, palm down, moves up and down repeatedly, increasing in amplitude<br>\n  <strong>pasek</strong> – the open hand, with pinky side down, moves downward once<br>\n  <strong>t'vir</strong> – with the index finger extended and the others in a fist, and with the hand oriented so the index finger points downward, the hand moves downward once<br>\n  <strong>mercha t'vir</strong> – as for <em>t'vir</em> alone, but the hand starts off oriented so the finger is pointing upward and arcs around<br>\n  <strong>sh'ne pashtin</strong> – the open hand, with pinky side down, moves back and forth<br>\n  <strong>kadma v'azla</strong>, <strong>darga</strong>, <strong>gershayim</strong>, <strong>r'via</strong> – with the index finger extended and the others in a fist, and with the hand oriented so the index finger points upward, the hand moves upward once<br>\n  <strong>talsha</strong> – with the hand in a fist and oriented so the back of the hand is upward, move the hand downward once</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He notes that all these traditions are still live but are dying.</p>\n\n<p>Note also that this paper indicates that it was presented with a videotape of the signs, including some of the above and some not listed above (from Egypt and Sana).</p>\n\n<p>I have also seen (and used) chironomy different from all the above. I suspect any synagogue, reader, or <em>gabay</em> can make up whatever suits him, so long as the reader understands it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Just for the sake of completeness:\nThe Yemenites have a system of hand signs that are more or less the same among all the different communities. However, the signs are designed for the Yemenite system of trop, which is based on the Babylonian system, just as their pronunciation is based on the Babylonian.  They later adapated it to the Tiberian system, just as all other Jews kept their traditional pronunciation of Hebrew, but adapted it to a greater or lesser extent to the Tiberian vocalization.  The Teimanim not only adapted their pronuciation, but also their trop.  And so the Teimani system of trop do not have any different musical realization of the m'sha'tim, and only have about 5 musical realizations for the mafsiqim, and so only 5 hand signals.\nSo it is not useful for other communities, but the fact that it is the same among all the Teimani regions, some of which have different pronuciations, would indicate that it is ancient.</p>\n\n\n",

I have heard that it has something to do with Kabbalah. Please correct me if I am wrong. Also Solomon (may peace and blessings be upon him) is falsely accused of having exercised control over demons and genies in his reign with the help of sorcery.</p>\n\n<p>According to David Livingston, author of <em>The Dying God</em>, the Kabbalah is a system of magic and sorcery developed by Jews during their exile in Babylon.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>Sorcery and witchcraft are explicitly forbidden by the Torah. Period. However, there are other methods of manipulating nature that do not fall into the category of \"sorcery\". For example, when a prophet or a tzaddik performs a miracle, they do it with G-d's implicit help and/or permission.</p>\n<p>Mystically, the difference between these two methods (sorcery and G-d given miracles), is their sources. When G-d created the world, He created spiritual forces of purity and impurity, and forbade the latter (cf. <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0530.htm#19\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). (Judaism does not believe in the autonomy of evil). Sorcery draws from the powers of \"impurity\" in the world, and as such, is forbidden. Miracles and Practical Kabbalah draw from the forces of purity (kedusha) and are therefore permitted.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As far as King Solomon's control over demons, all the stories I've heard of that involve his using pure forces (specifically, names of G-d), to capture and bind them. From the Talmud, Gittin 68a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Solomon then sent Benaiahu son of Yehoyada, giving him a chain on with the [Divine] Name engraved and a ring with the Name engraved...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Oh, and David Livingston? I would say that he's wrong, but the fact is that English does not really differentiate between magic and miracle. They both defy nature, and when performed by a person, they fall under the blanket of the English word \"magic\".

Each is as strong as the other. So today since the forces of holiness are so weak, the forces of tumah are also weak.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, just like there are holy Names which can be used to do things to manipulate the world according to certain books, so too there are names of tumah, which can be used to do things. this is witchcraft.

How then can we drink cup 3 and cup 4 of wine after the Afikomen? Does that not take away the flavor of the Matza?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The gemara (P'sachim 119b) mentions the prohibition of eating after the the final matzah (which is known nowadays as the afikoman). There are different opinions among the poskim as to the reason for this. The Rashbam (ad loc., s.v. אין מפטירין אחר המצה אפיקומן) writes that the reason is to prevent attenuating the taste of the matzah, which is eaten as a remembrance to the matzah that was eaten with the korban pesach. The Rif (P'sachim 27a) writes that one who is thirsty may drink only water after the afikoman. The Rambam (Hil. Chameitz uMatzah 8:9,10) rules likewise, and seems to say the the reason for prohibiting both eating and drinking is to preserve the taste of the matzah in one's mouth.</p>\n\n<p>The Rosh (P'sachim 10:34) writes that the afikoman is a remembrance to the korban pesach itself, after which dessert could not be eaten. However, he rules based on the Y'rushalmi (P'sachim 10:6) that the reason for not drinking more wine is to remain sober enough to stay awake and expound on the exodus from Egypt. Therefore, he rules, drinking anything aside from alcoholic beverages is permitted after the afikoman. The Tur (OC 481) quotes the same ruling in the name of Rabbeinu Yonah.</p>\n\n<p>The Ran (Chidushei HaRan, P'sachim 119b) writes that wine does not attenuate the taste of  the matzah enough to be a problem. Rather, he writes, the reason for not drinking more is to not disrupt the symbolism of the four cups of wine instituted by the sages. In his commentary on the Rif (ad loc.) he suggests that adding extra cups of wine would give the appearance of starting a new seder, which would at least symbolically controvert the prohibition against partaking of two different pesach offerings. (The P'ri Chadash OC 481:1 writes that this opinion prohibits drinking any chamar medina after the four cups).</p>\n\n<p>The Mordechai (on Arvei P'sachim, 38b) likewise writes that a significant amount of the matzah taste survives even if someone forgot to eat the afikoman. He rules (commentary on the Seder, 34a) that one may drink more wine after the meal is over and the table is cleared, since this does not give the appearance of adding to the mandated four cups. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz\">Bigdei Yesha</a> commentary suggests that the Ran would agree with this ruling.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura (481:1) writes that it is proper to be stringent on the first night of Pesach and, where possible, to follow all the above opinions. Therefore, he writes, only mild drinks like water, ginger ale, tea, or apple juice should be consumed after the afikoman. The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (481:1) writes that the essential reason for not drinking after the afikoman is to avoid getting drunk, as per the above cited Rosh. Therefore, he writes, one should only try to be stringent on the first night.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the four cups of wine instituted by the sages take priority over the objective of not drinking after the afikoman. Despite the Yerushalmi's statement to not drink wine between the third and fourth cups so as not to become inebriated, the Yerushalmi requires drinking those third and fourth cups. Even according to the opinions that prohibit drinking wine because of it's attenuating effect on the matzah taste, the required final two cups of wine that were explicitly instituted by the sages take priority over the gemara's implicit prohibition against drinking after the afikoman. Still, one should avoid drinking more than that and thereby preserve whatever matzah taste survives the last two cups. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe, quite frankly, that the question is based on the incorrect assumption that the Sages instituted a prohibition against tasting <em>anything</em> after the last bite of Matzah (which we colloquially call the Afikomen). This is not correct, as can be demonstrated by the simple fact that that's not how the Seder, arranged by the Sages, goes.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah is not telling us that the taste of the Matzah may not be weakened by the taste of anything, but that somehow wine does not weaken the taste of the Matzah.  It is true that in many ways a good wine enhances the taste of a meal.  There are professionals who arrange formal dinners that pair good wines with appropriate courses of a meal.  But that is not what the M\"B is about here, in my humble opinion.  I think that misses the point of the M\"B.</p>\n\n<p>The main point is that the Sages instituted and arranged the Seder.  The Seder that was instituted has two cups of wine after the last bite of Matzah.  The simple answer to this question is that we are following the Seder.  Shulhan 'Orech is over.  We have Bentched.  But there are still two more cups (and Hallel and Nirtzah) remaining.</p>\n\n\n",

The same article actually cites sources which say that an Ashkenazi davening in a Sfardic minyan should sit!</p>\n\n<p>Is this a contradiction or am I missing some nafka mina in the nature of the bracha or the law of standing while making a bracha? I'm looking at this as a dabbler so I apologize if I am asking something obvious.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The source for sitting while putting on the tefilin shel yad is Zohar Bemidbar 120:2, according to the Agur Hilchos Tefilin.  The Shla rules similarly, basing himself on Yeshayahu 6:1 and Shemos 17:16.</p>\n\n<p>The Ben Ish Chai says one should make the blessing while sitting, and the Magen Avraham says one should stand to make the blessing.  </p>\n\n<p>Since the Shulchan Aruch rules about <em>making a brocha</em> while standing, it seems to me that the question is on the Ben Ish Chai's ruling and not on the practice of putting the tefilin on while sitting.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Optional background:</strong> The <strong>Pnei Yehoshua</strong> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9703&st=&pgnum=432\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megila 21a</a> asks on Rashi's comment that the Mishna permits sitting for megila lechatechila- 'that it would seem that the bracha should also be sitting (PY doesn't exlain why).  This goes against the Yerushalmi that the Beis Yosef brings that all blessings on mitzvos are said standing?'  </p>\n\n<p>The PY answers by limiting the Yerushalmi to cases where the mitzva is done standing- those that we learn from Omer (Bakama/Bakoma+lecha)*.  But mitzos that are done sitting, the Yerushalmi would say to sit for the bracha.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magen Avraham</strong> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14326&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 8:2</a>) reads the Shulchan Aruch that both the mitzva and bracha of Talis should be done standing and asks from the mishna by chala which implies that an undressed woman may make a bracha if she's sitting.  The MA answers that Teruma is not such a mitzva since it's only to fix the food.  The PY assumes that his question is both on the bracha and the mitzva and doesn't understand the MA. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My take on the arguement</strong> (take it or leave it):  The PY holds that while the mitzva is the primary entity, a bracha was established prior to the mitzva, as if they are a single unit.  If you sit for the primary mitzva, you sit for the bracha.  The Yerushalmi was commenting specifically on the standing mitzvos.  The MA holds that while brachos were established prior to mitzvos, they are their own entity of hoda'a (thank You for sanctifying me with this mitzva).  We must stand for hoda'a- just like the Yerushalmi says (also, see the end of PY re hallel).  [Alternatively, it's an avoda and we stand for avoda- see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14265&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bach</a>.]  There are a few exceptions like chala, teruma, shechita- where you're not really sanctifying yourself like Talis, etc., your just fixing something in the food so you can eat it.  There is still a bracha, but it isn't really a hoda'a, we just keep the same format.  So you don't need to stand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For those who don't want to waste their time:</strong> The Pnei Yehoshua says that you look at the mitzva.  If the mitzva is sitting, the bracha is sitting.  The Magen Avraham holds that you always stand for birchos mitzva (with a handful of exceptions).</p>\n\n<p>It would seem based on Ashkenazi custom by megila (stand then sit) that Ashkenazim go with the Magen Avraham approach.  Sepharadim by tefilin seem to use an approach similar to the Pnei Yehoshua.  </p>\n\n<p>I would be curious to know what Sepharadim do by megila.</p>\n\n<p>[*Neither the BY's Yerushalmi nor the drasha of Omer appear in our talmudic texts]</p>\n\n\n",

We can, however, estimate that the average person maybe went a few times in his or her lifetime to the Temple. This can be pretty safely said about the Second Temple, and is probably also true for most of the years that the Tabernacle in Shiloh was active. As for the other periods - I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>Note: Most of this stuff was explained to me by one of my history professors. The kinei yoldot part is something I discovered via a shiur my grandfather z\"l, formerly an economics professor and founder of the Economics and Halachah program at BIU, gave a few times on Shavuot.</p>\n<p><strong>The Second Temple:</strong></p>\n<p>Maccabees II, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_II.2.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">allegedly</a> a summary of five books on the Maccabean Revolt written by one Jason of Cyrene, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_II.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">opens up</a> with two letters written to the Jewish community in Egypt. Both letters were written a number of decades after the Revolt.<sup>1</sup> In the letters, the Jews of Yerushalayim invite the Egyptian Jews to celebrate Chanukah with them. My guess is that if the vast majority of Jews came even just once or twice a year, there would have been no need to send a formal message inviting the Jews of Egypt to join in on the celebrations - decades after said events - because they would have been well aware of the festival already.</p>\n<p>Philo mentions that he went up once to the Temple (<a href=\"http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book38.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On Providence, Fragment I</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There is a city of Syria, on the sea shore, Ascalon by name: when I was there, at the time when I was on my journey towards the temple of my native land for the purpose of offering up prayers and sacrifices therein...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scholars generally agree that this means that Philo only came once (and some believe twice) to the Temple (being that he says \"my journey\" rather than \"a journey\" or \"one of my journeys\") - and Philo lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and was very wealthy and an important figure in the Alexandrian community - yet he was only able to come once or twice in his lifetime. What should we gather about people who lived farther away and/or were poorer?</p>\n<p>There are also some Chazalic sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Nazir.5.4?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Nazir 5:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...The incident in question was as follows: When nazirites were ascending from the exile to sacrifice their offerings, and they found the Temple destroyed, Naḥum the Mede said to them: If you had known that the Temple would be destroyed, would you have taken a vow of naziriteship? They said to him: Certainly not, as there is no remedy for a naziriteship in this case. And Naḥum the Mede dissolved the vow for them. And when the matter came before the Rabbis, they said: His ruling is incorrect. Rather, whoever took a vow of naziriteship before the Temple was destroyed, like these nazirites from the exile, he is a nazirite, as he committed no error at the time of his vow, and one cannot dissolve vows based a new situation. However, one who stated his vow after the Temple was destroyed is not a nazirite, as he vowed based on an erroneous assumption.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mishna records an event in which a group of nazirites came to give their due sacrifices after the destruction of the Temple. Now, remember that the Great Revolt had been going on for 3 or 4 years before the destruction (depending on when one dates the destruction) and continued on in other parts of Judea for another 3-5 years (again, depending on different views), making entry into Eretz Yisrael in general and Yerushalayim in particular extremely difficult - yet these nazirites were apparently completely clueless about all of this!</p>\n<p>In more aggadic fashion, the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.17a.1-17b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Brachot 17</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ודא מסייעא להו דמר ר' יודן בריה דר' אייבו עובדא הוה בחד יהודאי דהוה\nקאים רדי געת תורתיה קומוי עבר חד ערביי ושמע קלה א\"ל בר יודאי בר יודאי שרי תורך ושרי קנקנך דהא חריב בית מוקדשא געת זמן תניינות א\"ל בר יודאי בר יודאי קטור תוריך וקטור קנקניך דהא יליד מלכא משיחא א\"ל מה שמיה מנחם א\"ל ומה שמיה דאבוי א\"ל חזקיה א\"ל מן הן הוא א\"ל מן בירת מלכא דבית לחם יהודה...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"...And something that will assist in proving this interpretation, as what Rabbi Yudan, son of Rabbi Aibo recounted: Once there was a Jew who was plowing his field when his two oxen began to bleat. An Arab passed by and heard the sound. He said to him: \"Jew son of Jew, untie your oxen and untie your pitcher for your Temple has been destroyed.\" And the oxen proceeded to bleat again. He said to him: \"Jew son of Jew, tie your oxen and tie your pitcher for the King Mashiach has been born.\" Said [the Jew] to him: \"What is his name?\" \"Menachem.\" Said he to him: \"And what is his father's name?\" Said he to him: \"Chizkiyah.\" Said he to him: \"Where is he from?\" Said he to him: \"From the royal city of Beit Lechem of Yehudah.\"...\"</p>\n<p>Though aggadic, we might see here an echo of the situation in the diaspora, in which the average Arab (then a more nomadic people than they are nowadays) was more knowledgeable than the average Jew on the happenings in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n<p>Finally, l'havdil, the NT describes Jesus and his disciples coming to Yerushalayim:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2013&version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mark 13:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from here that these men from the nearby Galilee, in their twenties and thirties, had never been to Yerushalayim before and were astounded by its size and grandeur.</p>\n<p>In short, it seems that the average person hardly ever came to the Temple in his lifetime. Certainly, there are other sources that attest to the numbers that the city drew during the Regalim - but presumably, there was constant change in <em>who</em> came (i.e., same numbers, different people) - because it was very difficult to come every time.</p>\n<p><strong>One exception - kinei yoldot (nests of women after childbirth):</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Keritot.1.7?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Keritot 1:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"With regard to a woman who has in her case uncertainty concerning five births, and likewise a woman with regard to whom there is uncertainty concerning five irregular discharges of blood from the uterus [ziva], she brings one offering, and then she may partake of the meat of offerings. And the remaining offerings are not an obligation for her. If she experienced five definite discharges of a zava or five definite births, she brings one offering, and then she may partake of the meat of offerings. And the remaining offerings are an obligation for her...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the mishna - and as explained by my grandfather - it was customary for women during the Second Temple Era to bring childbirth or zava sacrifices only after several births or discharges took place - evidently waiting years before coming up to the Temple. It's possible that the mishna is referring to the average: On average, women came after five births or five discharges.</p>\n<p><strong>The Tabernacle in Shiloh:</strong></p>\n<p>Famously, in the story of the concubine of Givah, the survivors of the Tribe of Binyamin had to receive directions to know how to reach the Tabernacle in Shiloh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.21.19-20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 21:19-20</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then they said, Behold, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shilo which is on the north side of Bet-el, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bet-el to Shekhem, and on the south of Levona. Therefore they commanded the children of Binyamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Evidently people hardly came up to the Tabernacle, and this story, according to most views, took place pretty early in the Era of the Judges. A midrash further  expounds on this, but also explains how the situation was remedied during the last years of the Shiloh Era (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tanna_Debei_Eliyahu_Rabbah.8.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tannah Devei Eliyahu Rabbah 8</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אלקנה היה עולה לשילה ארבעה פעמים בשנה שלשה מן התורה ואחת שקיבל עליו הוא בנדבה...עלה אלקנה ואשתו ובניו ובני ביתו ואחיו ואחיותיו וכל קרוביו היו עולין עמו...וכשעולים עמו בדרך היו לנין ברחובה של עיר והיו מתקבצין האנשים לבד והנשים לבד שכן האיש היה מדבר עם האיש והאשה עם האשה וגדול עם הקטן והיתה המדינה מרגשת והיו שואלים להן להיכן תלכו ואומרים להם לבית האלקים שבשילה שמשם תצא תורה ומעשים טובים ואתם למה לא תבואו עמנו ונלך ביחד מיד עיניהם משגרות דמעות ואומרים להם נעלה עמכם וכן אמר להם עוד הפעם עד שעלו עמו לשנה הבאה חמשה בתים ולשנה האחרת עלו עמו עשרה בתים ולשנה האחרת הרגישו כולם לעלות והיו עולין עמו כמו ששים בתים ובדרך שהיה עולה שנה זו אינו עולה לשנה האחרת עד שהיו כל ישראל עולין והיה אלקנה מכריע את כל ישראל לכף זכות וחינך אותם במצות וזכו רבים על ידו...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"Elkanah would go up to Shiloh four times a year: Three times from the Torah and once more that he took upon himself charitably...Elkanah went up with his wife and sons and his household and borthers and sisters and all of his relative went up with him...and when they went up with him on the road, they would sleep in the middle of the city and people would gather - the men by themselves and the women by themselves, for man would speak with man and woman with woman and an elder with a youth and the country would take notice and they would ask them: \"To where are you going?\" And they replied: \"We are going to the House of the LORD in Shiloh for from there the Torah and good deeds shall come out. And you, why shouldn't you come with us and we shall go together?\" Immediately, their eyes would fill with tears and they would say to them: \"We shall come up with you!\" And so he said to them once again, until they came up with him. By the next year, five houses came [with him] and the next year - ten houses, and the next year, everyone felt the need to come up, and some sixty houses would come with him, and in the road that he went up one year he did not go the next, until all of Yisrael would go up and Elkanah brought Yisrael to be judged favorably and he educated them in mitzvot and everyone merited by him...\"</p>\n<p>We see that for most of the time that the Tabernacle was in Shiloh, hardly anyone went up there, until Elkanah fixed this.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, it is Elkanah's wife Chanah who, like the women after childbirth in the Second Temple Era, puts off the time of her coming to the Tabernacle after giving birth to Shmuel for a few years (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.1.21-24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:1:21-24</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And when the man Elkanah and all his household were going up to offer to the LORD the annual sacrifice and his votive sacrifice, Hannah did not go up. She said to her husband, “When the child is weaned, I will bring him. For when he has appeared before the LORD, he must remain there for good.” Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do as you think best. Stay home until you have weaned him. May the LORD fulfill His word.” So the woman stayed home and nursed her son until she weaned him. When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a jar of wine. And though the boy was still very young, she brought him to the House of the LORD at Shiloh.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we find that even in ancient times, it was not considered problematic for a woman to put off bringing the childbirth sacrifice.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> See Daniel Schwartz's commentary on the letters in his edition of the book for an explanation on the dating system used by the authors of the letters.</p>\n\n\n",

But he added that if he would have had available the division of the Baalei Hamesorah he would have preferred to use that.

Aggaditah is the general terminology for narrative, non-halachic sections of Rabbinic literature. Midrash is a genre of Rabbinic literature composed of homiletic sermons based on p'sukim. Much of these become the Aggadic sections that are so often associated with Midrash. Not all Midrashim are Aggadic though. Sifrei and Sifra are halachic Midrash which often show up in halachic literature. In short, Midrash describes a type of sefer, Aggaditah describes a type of content. The trend to use the two terms interchangeably is inaccurate. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggadah\">Wikipedia article on Aggadah</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash\">Wikipedia article on Midrash</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word aggadah is to be understood as simply meaning \"relating\". \nMidrash is \"to seek, study, inquire\" that which is being related, the aggadah. </p>\n\n<p>If you wish, aggadah is the p'shat (simple) narrative, which is followed by the midrash.

    "content": "# The order of Tehillim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sefer Tehillim (Psalms) consists of 150 <em>mizmorim</em>, most likely compiled (and perhaps even entirely written) by King David. The <em>mizmorim</em> are not in chronological order following the events that inspired them, as is clearly seen from their introductions. (Although I have not ruled out the possibility that they are in chronological order of their composition.) Let us assume that they are not just randomly permuted, but rather grouped in their specific order for a reason (or many reasons) realating to their content.</p>\n\n<p>What are good (preferably medieval) sources that consistently discuss the order of the <em>mizmorim</em>? To be clear: I am looking for Jewish sources and commentaries that discuss reasons for the juxtapositions of the chapters in Tehillim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't think there's any one-size-fits-all answer. But let's start with the first few chapters:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38172&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meiri</a> writes that the first and second chapters are juxtaposed (actually, the Gemara, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=10&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachos 10a</a>, states that originally they were one chapter) because, having pointed out that those who follow Hashem have it good and those who disobey Him are \"like a leaf driven by the wind\" whose \"way is lost\" (1:4, 6), David continues by rhetorically asking why the \"kings of the earth\" - those who are successful materially - don't realize this.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara there then explains, taking ch. 2 as referring to the war of Gog and Magog, that ch. 3 follows next in order to highlight the similarity between their rebellion against Hashem and Avshalom's rebellion against his father.</p>\n\n<p>Meiri then <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38172&st=&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggests</a> that ch. 4 was also written during Avshalom's rebellion. I've also seen an idea (might have been in Daat Mikra, but I'm not sure) that there is a thematic connection between 3:6 and 4:9, in both of which David expresses his confidence that Hashem will protect him when he sleeps, and also with 4:6, \"Say it in your hearts upon your beds.\" So those two are kind of the equivalent of the nighttime Shema - indeed, in Nusach Ashkenaz ch. 3 is said then. Next, then, comes ch. 5, which is a morning prayer (\"Hashem, in the morning may You hear my voice\" - v. 4).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>By the way, tosafos in Pesachim 117a have a different number if perakim in tehillim. They also say that it makes no sense that a <em>mizmor</em> would have 2 peukim; yet we have perek 117 that has 2! It is probable that the tos' had 117 as part of another mizmor. futhermore, see the first tos' yeshanim in yevamos, who has tanach in a different order than we do. and also see shabbos 55b in the <em>gilion hashas</em> who lists all places where the gemara has a different girsa of a pasuk that we do.</p>\n\n\n",

That explanation claims to come from Rashi, but I just checked again, and Rashi on Chumash there doesn't say a word. Anyone else have a reference backing this up?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn't find it in Rashi. However, see <a href=\"http://arikahn.blogspot.com/2010/03/parshat-tzav-5770-no-hesitation.html\">this blogpost</a> by Rabbi Ari Kahn, who notes a midrash in Vayikra Rabba {perhaps cited by Rashi} that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Helbo said: All the seven days of consecration Moshe ministered in the office of Kohen Gadol, and he imagined it was his. On the seventh day He said to him: ‘It belongs not to you but to your brother Aharon.’ This is [indicated by] what is written, \"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moshe called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Israel, and he said unto Aharon…\" (Vayikra Rabbah 11:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and this is connected to Moshe's earlier improper statement of \"Send, I pray Thee, by the hand of whomever You will send (Shmot 4:13)\". Rabbi Khan suggests that Moshe would naturally have felt disappointment in this. And so, he connects it to the hesitation indicated by the shalsheles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Joseph Ibn Caspi (in his commentary to Bereishis 19:16), the Shalsheles note conveys a state of uncertainty and indecision.

Moshe Bogomilski in his sefer Vedibarta Bam on Parashas Tzav in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polonoye (1704 - 1794)\nIs says there: \"\"וישחט...\"\n“And he slaughtered...” (8:23)\nQUESTION: The “trop” (cantillation) on this word is a shalshelet — a three-tiered tremolo tone. In the Torah we find three other words chanted with a shalshelet:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>When the angels told Lot to leave the city of Sodom, we are told “vayitmahmah” — “and he lingered” (Bereishit 19:16).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When Eliezer went to find a suitable wife for Yitzchak, he prayed and we are told “vayomar” — “and he said” (Bereishit 23:12).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When the wife of Potifar wanted Yosef to commit a sin, the Torah says “vayema’ein” — “and he refused” (Bereishit 39:8).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What connection is there between these four expressions sung with a shalshelet?</p>\n<p>ANSWER: The Gemara (Berachot 5a) says that a person should incite his yeitzer tov against his yeitzer hara (declare war against the yeitzer hara), and if he manages to overcome the yeitzer hara it is good, but if not he should engage in the study of Torah. If this does not defeat the yeitzer hara, then he should recite the Shema, and if he is still not successful then he should remind the yeitzer hara of the day of death.</p>\n<p>According to commentaries, the “day of death” does not refer to the individual’s passing, which the yeitzer hara strives for since he is also the angel of death (Bava Batra 16a). It is referring to the dictum of the Gemara (Sukkah 52a) that in the future Hashem will slaughter the yeitzer hara. Therefore, the Gemara is saying that if one’s yeitzer hara is manifesting itself, “yazkir lo yom hamitah” — one should remind him that he is going to be slaughtered and that he should not be too proud of himself.</p>\n<p>A person must strive to restrain his yeitzer hara, but if he sees that “vayitmahmah” — the yeitzer hara lingers on and does not want to give up — “vayomar” — he should begin to study divrei Torah and recite the Shema. But if “vayema’ein” — the yeitzer hara still refuses to give up — then “vayishchat” — he should inform the yeitzer hara that Hashem will slaughter it one day — and upon hearing this the yeitzer hara will stop pestering the Jew to violate the Torah.</p>\n<p>(בית יעקב מר' יעקב הכהן ע\"ה טראב - מסלתון)</p>\n\n\n",

He also states that the מהר'ש based it on the ספר אבי'ה - presumably the ראבי'ה. There are two things being symbolized.  The use of the finger symbolizes the 'finger of G-d' and the number of times has a gematria of 16. The דרכי משה explains this to be referring to the faces of the חיות or a gematria linking it to G-d's sword. The משנה ברורה (in ס'ק עד on that סימן) has it referring to the name of G-d (י-ו). The specific finger to use is brought by the מגן אברהם (in ס'ק כח) as the קמיצה (ring finger) based on a מדרש that G-d used his ring finger to deliver the plagues. The שער הציון on that piece also says that it's better to spill from the cup if you will be disgusted drinking from a glass you put your finger in and that some authorities say that its preferable to spill whatever the case. </p>\n\n\n",

But his message is clearly meant to resonate with other Jews and their institutions. He is advocating a re-imagining across the sectarian board. The only reason I think that this advice is more focused on Reform synagogues is that <p>\na) the decentralization of the communal identity from the synagogue runs counter to the more traditional idea of the synagogue as the mikdash -- the locus of communal worship, social life and study<p>\nb) groups which do specialize in the traveling kiruv (at the airport, in public areas, on college campuses) have often been chabad based, and chabad is not a reform organization. Same for JLIC.<p>\nc) I would be so bold as to guess that the majority of religious private schools in the Jewish community are Connservative or Orthodox (or more right wing) thus taking the religion out of the prayer/synagogue and putting it in the forefront in another milieu so as to attract families or individuals without tethering it to a house of worship, pushing for religion to be more pervasive and not compartmentalized in the realm of prayer.<p></p>\n\n<p>So, in sum, I'd say that while the advice is somewhat useful for everyone, the writer is trying to galvanize a broader range of Reform temples to take on this task.

    "content": "# What does Heimishe mean?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Literally it means \"homey.\" </p>\n\n<p>But I'm asking about the sociological meaning of the group of people who call themselves \"Heimishe.\" My best guess is that it means \"midway between Hassidish and Litvak.\" But given that differences between Hassidim and Litvaks, though they surely exist, are not what they were during the heyday of the Misnagdim, what is the difference between Litvak and Heimishe?</p>\n\n<p>Does \"Heimishe\" also suggest that these people go to university? That they speak English rather than Yiddish? There are no Heimishe organizations per se, but are there organizations which everyone identifies with Heimishism?</p>\n\n<p>(Some webpages discussing this: <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/what-does-heimish-mean\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a> <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/heimish-what-does-it-mean-to-you\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2</a> <a href=\"http://www.frumsatire.net/2008/07/03/what-the-heck-does-heimishe-mean/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>Having grown up \"heimish\" I will do my best to explain. </p>\n\n<p>The first thing I tell people that ask me to define Heimish, is \"mixed up\". From the outside looking in, our accent in davening is typically that of chassidim, yet we (For the most part) are clean shaven (which is a huge no-no in the chassidish world). You might see us wear a gartel on shabbos (chassidish) while wearing a suit and tie (not-chassidish). Heimish people also frequent going to rebbes. So, yes we're sort of mixed up.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience, there are really two kinds of backgrounds to Heimish ppl. </p>\n\n<p>1) After the war, many people who were brought up full-on chassidish, when they moved to various parts of Europe, or came to the states, they either weren't comfortable wearing the chassidish get-up or whatever their reasons were, they decided to shave and wear the more litvish style of clothing. These people, while all their minhagim and traditions were all Chassidish, they didn't dress the part anymore. However, the chassidish way of life was really all they knew.</p>\n\n<p>2) Back in Hungary, there were many towns and shtetls that bordered around the bigger chassidish towns and these people all gravitated towards the rebbes in the larger towns, but they themselves weren't full on chassidish. Litvish however they were not, as all the customs they followed were from the chassidim around them.</p>\n\n<p>In our generation though, the whole concept of Heimish is really dying out. Growing up, there were many yeshivas that were chassidish yeshivas, where the rebbeim spoke Yiddish, and half the class was actually chassidish (think of Yagdil Torah, Veen etc) however the other half of the class had payis behind the ears (litvish style) and were considered \"Heimish\". What happened over the years though was that most started to feel this \"mixed up\" feeling and sort of chose a path. Many went to litvish yeshivas for high school/beis midrash and started acceping the litvish way of life, while the other half went to more chassidish yeshivas, and started growing a beard and put on a shtreimel when they got married. Our kids generation therefore is pretty well defined. There are very few if any (Veretsky in brooklyn being the exception) yeshivas that have chassidish yiddish speaking rebbeim, with the parent body being clean shaven (Montreal still has a little bit of that as well, however in Brooklyn/Lakewood etc it's pretty much over).</p>\n\n<p>For me personally, to this day I feel mixed up. I speak a fluent Yiddish, have a chassidish havara, yet I live in Lakewood in a total litvish environment. I don't fit into bp anymore as that became very Chassidish (I'm clean shaven and not chassidish at all) but I feel like an outsider here in Lakewood as well since at my core, all my customs, my whole upbrining was very different than that of the Litvish folks I live amongst. </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to ask further questions in the comments....</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>I'm surprised to read the other answers provided, not to mention the direction of the question leading to those answers. I didn't know what to expect when I clicked on the title, but it wasn't that. </p>\n\n<p>I have personally never heard the word in any context other than, simply, \"friendly\". As in: \"This is a Heimish Shul\" (not as a denomination, but just generally friendly, welcoming, and warm, usually on account of being fairly small); \"This is a Heimish restaurant\"; \"The staff at that Judaica store are so Heimish\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The word Heimish means comfortable. So to a Litvak another Litvak is Heimish and to a Chassid another Chassid is Heimish.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why aren't Purim and Channuka considered a violation of לֹא תֹסִפוּ?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9968\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא תֹסִפוּ עַל הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוֶּה אֶתְכֶם וְלֹא תִגְרְעוּ מִמֶּנּוּ לִשְׁמֹר אֶת מִצְוֹת יְ־הֹוָ־ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוֶּה אֶתְכֶם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Translated:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not add to the word which I command you, nor diminish from it, to observe the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I understand that the rabbis have the ability to make halachot that are either guards on another halacha (e.g. the concept of <em>muktza</em>) or interpretations of a halacha in torah (e.g. not using electricity on shabbat, being that there was obviously no such thing as electricity when the torah was given). However Chanukah and Purim are not guards on mitzvot, nor are they interpretations of what a mitzva means. They are entirely new mitzvot! So why don't Purim and Chanukah fall into the category of <em>לֹא תֹסִפוּ</em>?</p>\n<p>At this point, I am usually given the answer:   <em>\"Purim and Chanukah are mitzvot derrabannun (from the rabbis) and since they don't claim that it is a mitzva deorita (a mitzva directly from torah) they were allowed to establish it\"</em>.</p>\n<p>Now the problem I have with the above statement is as follows:</p>\n<p>There is a Gemara in <em>Brachot</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=27b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">27b</a>) that says (and I'm paraphrasing) that a person who quotes his rabbi on something that he never said is causing the Shechinah to depart from the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Now I quote the actual bracha that is said on Chanukah and Purim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ברוך אתה <strong>ה' א‑לוהינו מלך העולם</strong>, <strong>אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו</strong> להדליק נר של חנוכה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Blessed are You, <strong>Lord, our G-d, King of the universe</strong>, Who has sanctified us with His commandments <strong>and commanded us</strong> to kindle the Hanukkah lights.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same is true for Purim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ברוך אתה <strong>ה' א‑לוהינו מלך העולם</strong>, <strong>אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו</strong> על מקרא מגלה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Blessed are You, <strong>Lord, our G-d, King of the universe</strong>, Who has sanctified us with His commandments <strong>and commanded us</strong> to read the Megillah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now according to the bracha, it is saying that G-d himself commanded us to light the Chanukah candles, which is in fact not true, as the torah was given far before the story of Chanukah.</p>\n<p>Around this time, I usually get the answer: <em>\"It says in the torah that you have to listen to the rabbis, therefor, since the torah says listen to the rabbis, and the rabbis say light candles on Chanukah, then the torah is saying light candles on Chanukah\"</em>.</p>\n<p>Now I have a huge problem with this, because they could have very easily worded the bracha such that it said <em>\"Blessed are You, Lord, our G-d, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us <strong>to follow the ways of the rabbis, who have told us to</strong> kindle the Hanukkah lights.\"</em></p>\n<p>Now I go back to the Gemara that I quoted earlier. If it considered such a horrible thing to misquote your rabbi, than <em>Kal Vachomer</em> wouldn't it be even worse to misquote G-d himself???</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since most of the people here probably originated on Stack Overflow, I though I would try giving an analogy to programming. Let's say I take a programming class with teacher-X. Teacher-X learned how to program directly from Mark Zuckerberg himself. On the first day of class, Mark Zuckerberg comes in, and tells us that he had personally taught Teacher-X himself, and he really knows what he is talking about, so we should listen to everything he says. Teacher-X teaches me to program using a specific style which I go on to use when I code. One day, I am writing a program with my friend, and he notices the strange style I am coding with, so he asks why I am doing it that way. I tell him, Mark Zuckerberg taught me to do it. Well, in fact, Mark Zuckerberg did not teach me to do it that way, and saying that he did was is a false statement. I learned it from Teacher-X, Zuckerberg just told me to listen to him because he had trained him. Similarly, when saying the bracha on Chanukah candles, saying that G-d himself commanded me to light the Chanukah candles is a false statement. He simply told me to listen to someone who did. And I am now quoting G-d with something he never said. And while it may not in practice be as horrible as what is said in the Gemara, I would imagine it is still not a good thing to do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how were the Rabbanim able to create Channukah and Purim in the way they did? I don't want to start accusing the Rabbanim of directly violating the laws of the torah, however I'm having a hard time understanding how they could create these holidays in the way they did without doing so. So what <em>did</em> allow them to do it like this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The mitzvos of Purim and Chanuka definitely fit the bill for the violation of lo sosifu according to the Ramban (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9617&st=&pgnum=65\">vaeschanan 4:2</a>).  More specifically, the Yerushalmi quotes a different pasuk- <em>These</em> are the mitzvos that Hashem commanded Moshe.  Lo sosifu refers to adding in general, but the former pasuk forbids adding even through prophecy.  </p>\n\n<p>Both the Bavli (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=14&format=pdf\">Megila 14a</a>) and the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14138&st=&pgnum=468\">Megila 6b</a>) take issue with Purim.  The Bavli allows Purim based on a kal v'chomer drash from the Torah:  If we establish a day of praise for Hashem freeing us from bondage, certainly we can do so for His saving our lives.  The Ritva applies the same logic to Chanuka.  The Yerushalmi says that they only allowed the writting of the megilla after finding \"hints\" in the Torah (ie, megilla was built into the Torah in advance).  </p>\n\n<p>I would guess that once the Holiday had a leg to stand on, any mitzvos that are ancillary to the holiday would be permitted as well.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the Brachos, I'm not bothered by that question.  Throughout the talmud, the sages try to keep things uniform so that the masses would not get confused.  For example: Lo palug, nasata devarecha l'shiurim, and generally many decrees were based on avoiding confusion.  As long as the sages are not instituting a text that is false (see Alex and Drew's answer), best practice is to keep the same format as other blessings and not confuse the masses by trying to be \"more truthful\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>That statement about quoting something not from one's teacher is taken by Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=3&perek=5&halocha=9&hilite=\">Hil. Talmud Torah 5:9</a>) to mean that by failing to quote the author, one implies that his teacher made this statement (since it can be generally assumed that whatever a student says comes from his teacher). In other words, the problem isn't saying \"Rabbi X said Y\" when he never said that, but simply saying \"Y\" in such a way that people will assume that Rabbi X said it. That is different than stating something that indeed can be inferred from what Rabbi X said, something which is common throughout the Talmud (as in the common expression לאו בפירוש אתמר אלא מכללא - Berachos 9a and in over a dozen other places). While it is true that R. Eliezer (the author of the statement to which you're referring) was particularly careful about that - \"he never said anything that he hadn't heard from his teachers\" (Sukkah 27b, et al), we see that this is not the general practice.</p>\n\n<p>By the same token, then, it is indeed perfectly in order to attribute an order to the controlling authority rather than to his subordinates. (It is the same way as, lehavdil, we might state that such-and-such is \"President so-and-so's policy\" even though in fact it may originate from the deputy assistant secretary of such-and-such agency - because ultimately that person answers to, and derives his or her legal authority from, that of the president.) So since Hashem is the one who gives the sages the authority to legislate such mitzvos, it is correct to state that He (indirectly) commanded them.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam (Hil. Berachos 11:3) puts it as follows (translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/927679/jewish/Chapter-Eleven.htm\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Where has He commanded us [to fulfill these commandments]? In the Torah, which states [Deuteronomy 17:11]: \"Act [according to the judgment] they relate to you.\" [Based on this Biblical verse, the blessing recited before fulfilling a Rabbinical commandment] can be interpreted as follows: Who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to listen to these [sages] who have commanded us to light Chanukah candles or read the megillah. The same applies regarding all Rabbinic commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The verse that Rambam quotes is one of the ones mentioned in Shabbos 23a, as in Drew's answer.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rambam answers in his introduction to Mishneh Torah that Bal Tosif isnt violated since megilah doesnt purport to be Biblical, but rather is clearly rabbinic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"He is not saying that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us to make an eruv or read the Megillah at its [appointed] time. Were he to say so, he would be adding to the Torah. Instead, we are saying that the prophets and the courts ordained....\" (trans. Moznaim)</p>\n  \n  <p>הרי לא אמרו שהקדוש ברוך הוא ציוה לעשות עירוב או לקרות המגילה בעונתה. ואילו אמרו כן, היו מוסיפין על התורה. אלא כך אנו אומרין: שהנביאים עם בית דין תיקנו וציוו לקרות המגילה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://text.rcarabbis.org/%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94-a-case-study-in-rabbinic-authority-by-elliot-m-salinger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for further reading.</p>\n\n\n",

I'll go through each Masechta. For anything that I say just \"Rashi\", that means that everyone who learns Gemara assumes that it's Rashi, and I have never seen any proof otherwise. For an original discussion of Rashi, see שם הגדולים לחיד׳׳א, ערך רש׳׳י. [Many of the things that I source could benefit from daf numbers, footnotes, and general sourcing.

The reason for this (I have found) is that what is printed as Rashi isn't complete - the <strong>Or Zarua</strong> on Eiruvin very extensively quotes Rashi, with more actual text than is printed in the Vilna Shas. To get a full picture of what Rashi means, you need both.</p>\n<p>Pesachim - Rashi, and Rashbam on the last perek.

This commentary predates Rashi, and is written in a similar style. It is almost certainly the \"Kuntres of Mayence\", which is also sometimes attributed to R. Gershom Me'or HaGolah. There are some Rishonim that quote \"Rashi\", and it is none other than R. Elkayam (the Ritva does this in at least one place). This author wrote a commentary on most of Shas (see the Mozanim introduction), and if we had it, I assume that most of the confusion about the \"Kuntres\" of Tosafos which is not always in Rashi would be alleviated.

Gershom\" on Taanis and the \"Rashi\", it it obvious that there's something like 90% overlap. It is very likely IMO that \"Rashi\" here is actual R. Elkayam. Something else to note is that Tosafos on Taanis (which is an odd commentary in of itself, see בעלי התוספת by E.E. Urbach in his entry about Maseches Taanis) quotes <strong>lots</strong> of \"Rashi\" - but never says פירוש הקונטרס or כתב רש׳׳י like they do in other Masechtos.

The Vilna Shas, on the backside of the <em>shaar blaat</em>, says that it is the Rivan, Rashi's son-in-law. It is definitly not Rashi. A sefer called פירוש רש׳׳י על מסכת נזיר was printed in תשפ׳׳ה by Machon Ofeq.

From there until the last perek, there are two printed versions of Rashi, one from the printer and one from R. Bezalel Ashkenazi. Tosafos usually quote the one from RBA.

The Baal haMeor comments that the Mishna implies that work after noon is independent of custom and is strictly forbidden, quoting a Yerushalmi that the sages prohibited work during the time of korban.  The Baal haMeor concludes that since nowadays there is no korban, work is not strictly forbidden and is based on custom.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban rejects the baal haMeor's conclusion, bringing supporting proofs, and concludes that the prohibition of work after noon remains.</p>\n\n<p>Summary:  There is a dispute whether work on the afternoon of Nissan 14 is rabinnically forbidden or if it is merely a custom.

Corian is also a form of plastic that cannot be kashered, but since the chometz penetrates only a thin layer of the counter, it can be sanded down to take off a layer of Corian (the thickness of a piece of paper). It then is considered kosher for Pesach. However, only a qualified contractor should attempt this procedure. <em><strong>Pure Granite (not granite composite), Marble, Stainless Steel, or Metal</strong></em> may be kashered through eruy roschim. <em><strong>Wood</strong></em> may also be kashered through eruy roschim if it has a smooth surface.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for glass not needing to be Kashered, that does not appear to be so simple.

This is accomplished by submerging the glasses for one 24 hour period. The water should then be emptied and refilled and alowed to sit for another 24 hours. This procedure should be repeated a third time, for a total of 72 hours. This procedure of submerging cannot be used for Pyrex or glass that was used directly on the fire or in the oven. In general, kashering glasses is only recommended in cases of difficulty. Wherever glasses are readily available for purchase, special glasses for Pesach are preferable. Arcoroc and Corelle should be treated as glass for kashering purposes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Is it a k'zayit of the powder, or the amount of powder from a k'zayit of horseradish?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=91&format=pdf\">Shabbat 91a</a>) discusses the minimum measurement of food that must be carried between domains on Shabbat in order to be obligated in punishment. The minimum shiur depends on what the intended use of the object is. A kegrogeret (the size of a dried fig, which is greater than or equal to a kezayit) is the minimum amount of food when the food is intended for eating. When it is intended for planting, even a minute amount is sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara there asks a number of questions regarding someone who transferred a dried fig between domains, but while he was carrying it the fig shrunk and/or grew in size, and/or the carrier's intended use changed. (Fun stuff!) The gemara notes in its discussion that when the fig shrinks in size, it loses its status as a \"שיעור אכילה\" -- a sufficient measurement for eating purposes.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem that the relevant factor when determining eating-related measurements is the current size.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=54&format=pdf\">Menachot 54a</a>) suggest a machloket tannaim regarding how we measure the kometz of a minchat chotea that got wet with water, thereby swelling. (A minchat chotea was usually brought dry per <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0305.htm#11\">Vayikra 5:11</a>.) One opinion says we go after the way it is now, while the other opinion says that we view it as it was before the water was added. The gemara spends a few pages debating these two sides but seems to end up rejecting the latter opinion. A ruling brought up in the discussions there is brought in the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/a604.htm#5\">Rambam Tum'at Ochlin 4:6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כזית חלב ודם ונותר ופיגול שהניחן בחמה ונתמעטו אין חייבין עליהן כרת, הניחן בגשמים ונתפחו חזרו לכמות שהיו, בין לטומאה חמורה בין לטומאה קלה בין לאיסור<br>\n  A kezyit of forbidden fats, blood, old sacrificial meat, or mis-offered sacrificial meat [all of which are forbidded with Karet] which was left in the sun and shrunk, one is not obligate in Karet for eating them; if he subsequently left them in the rain and they swelled up again to their original size, they return to their original state in regards their ritual impurity upon contact and their Karet upon consumption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that when something is dried below its minimum shiur, it doesn't qualify as eating/touching the original shiur of food. However, it can be reconstituted.</p>\n\n<p>Thus we see again that the relevant factor when determining eating-related measurements is the current size.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When Israel and the diaspora are out of sync on parshiyot, why don't we take the first opportunity to re-align?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This year (5772) the seventh day of Pesach is on a Friday, so the diaspora has an 8th day of chag on Shabbat but Israel does not.  The diaspora will thus read Sh'mini on April 21, Tazria-Metzora on Apr 28, and so on through Bamidbar right before Shavuot.  Israel, on the other hand, will read Sh'mini on April 14, Tazria-Metzora on April 21, and so on, waiting until Behar-Bechukotai to split a double (to end up at Bamidbar before Shavuot, as we expect).</p>\n\n<p>There are three double parshiyot between April 14 and Shavuot.  I would have expected the first one to be split in order to get the readings back in sync as soon as possible.  (This would have meant being out of sync for only two weeks.)  Instead, the calendars are not re-aligned until the last of the doubles.  Further, if it were a leap year it would be even worse -- we would be out of sync until Mattot-Masei (h/t DoubleAA).</p>\n\n<p>Why do we delay syncing up past the first double parsha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>The reason we have double parshiyos in the first place is in order to satisfy the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/4072/37\">four basic rules</a> (given in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40432&pgnum=11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 428:4</a>) about the distribution of parshiyos throughout the year. In particular, the first two are: that the Shabbos before Pesach has to be Parshas Tzav in a regular year, or Metzora in a leap year; and that the Shabbos before Shavuos has to be Parshas Bamidbar. Since Tzav is the 25th parshah in the Torah, and Bamidbar is the 34th, and since in most regular years there are only six Shabbasos available between Pesach and Shavuos, then the standard layout is that there are three pairs of double parshiyos during Iyar in a regular year.</p>\n\n<p>R. Yissachar ibn Susan (Tikkun Yissachar) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21647&pgnum=104\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a>, then, that if the people of Eretz Yisrael were to split apart an earlier pair of parshiyos (Tazria-Metzora or Acharei-Kedoshim), then that would imply that they are less important than the Jews living outside the Land (in that they have to change their usual practice for the sake of the chutzniks). Instead, then, they wait until the last available pair (in this case, Behar-Bechukosai) and then split that pair up, because at that point there's no choice - they have to do so in order that Bamidbar be read on the Shabbos before Shavuos.</p>\n\n<p>In a leap year, the people of the diaspora keep Matos-Masei combined to get back in sync because in that kind of year (as in most others) it's normal for Matos-Mas'ei to be combined. (Maharit (2:4) <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1385&st=&pgnum=224&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">says</a> that we don't combine a pair of parshiyos before Shavuos so that the Jews in the Diaspora (who have the possibility of doing so) can read Parshas Bamidbar in its proper place just before Shavuos, and once we're already pushing it off, we try to place the double parshah as close to the next of the four checkpoints as possible, in order to demonstrate that we are doing so in order to keep to the rules. This could even be why Matos-Mas'ei is chosen in general to be doubled instead of Chukas-Balak in years where we need a double parshah to guarantee proper placement of Parshas Devarim before Tisha B'av.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I'm summarizing and excerpting some point in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/56264/5275\">my other answer</a> related to this question. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The only requirement in the Gemara concerning Shabbos Torah readings\n  is limited to the need to read certain portions of the Torah prior to\n  Shevuos and Rosh Hashanah, :מגילה לא׃ תניא ר׳ שמעון בן אלעזר אומר עזרא\n  תיקן להן לישראל שיהו קורין קללות שבתורת כהנים קודם עצרת ושבמשנה תורה\n  קודם ראש השנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rule states that the \"curses\" located in Bechukotai should be read before Shavuot. It is unclear if this means immediately before Shavu'ot, or by the time Shavu'ot comes, it should have already been read, meaning that it can be read 1 0r 2 weeks earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Ramba'M adds an additional rule that <em>Va'etchanan</em> should be read on the SHabbat immediately after Tish'a B'Av. (I have to see if he explains why he added this rule.)</p>\n\n<p>By combining these two rules, here's how things work out.</p>\n\n<p>During a non-leap year, in Diaspora, we would need to double <em>Behar-Bechukota</em> to assure that the 1st tochacha is read before Shavuot. (It seems that this needs to be at least 2 weeks before Shavuot and not immediately before.) In Israel, since they were already ahead, there's no need to double up, here.</p>\n\n<p>During a leap year, Bechukotai is already read 2 weeks before Shavuot in Diaspora, so there's no adjustment needed.</p>\n\n<p>However, by the time we arrive at Tisha B'Av, in Diaspora, Matot-Masie need to be doubled, otherwise <em>Va'etchanan</em> would be read two weeks after Tisha B'av and not immediately after. In Israel, since they have been a week ahead of Diaspora, they don't need to double up.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally, Matot and Mas'ei are rarely separated. In Diaspora it occurs in leap years when the previous Rosh Hashanna was on Thursday and Pesach is either on Tuesday or Sunday. Same idea in Israel, but they get an extra occurrence on a leap year with Pesach on Shabbat.)</p>\n\n\n",

Friday is a bank holiday. Are we allowed to open the account on Chol HaMoed? </p>\n\n<p>On the one hand it seems that the answer to this question (already posed to the Rav but no answer yet) should be No because we are arranging to do the work on Chol HaMoed.

They are <em>chumrot</em> — binding customs of the community.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefardic <em>kitniyot</em> custom permits rice provided it has been carefully checked grain-by-grain before Passover begins to ensure that no <em>chametz</em> grains are in it.  (How carefully depends on the tradition; I have seen \"3 times\" and \"7 times\" specified by different traditions.)  Ashkenazic custom is much more restrictive when it comes to <em>kitniyot.</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Chametz is a biblical term which refers to grains which ferment when water is added.  This fermentation causes the dough mixture to puff up.

Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri has a broader definition of the term chametz, but his minority opinion is rejected from halacha in favor of a more specific type of fermentation which would categorize rice as non-chametz.</p>\n\n<p>Communities which refrain from eating rice on Pesach are limited to those communities who have accepted to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

If man's nature nature was compelled to serve Hashem (i.e. no yetzer hara), he would not attain the more perfected (G-dly) quality of independence, and his ability to attach to Hashem would be diminished, and consequently it would diminish G-d's ability to bestow chessed on man.</p>\n\n<p>The above is my best effort to paraphrase Derech Hashem.

[Deut. 30:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What [single] “commandment” [does the Torah refer to]?  The Rabbis say: It is a difficult concept to state.  [Maharzu: It seems inappropriate to say that because it implies we can \"help\" God.] ...  It means: “If you observe the Torah, you have done a charitable act both for you and for Me.” [Deut. R. 8:5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, God derives some benefit from Jews following the Torah.</p>\n<p>On Yom Kippur, we say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avinu Malkenu 'aseh l'maancha im lo l'maanenu -- Our Father, our King, act for Your sake if not for ours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This implies that God has a stake in forgiving us.</p>\n<p>The Psalmist says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תְּנוּ עֹז לֵאלֹהִים\nT'nu 'oz l'Elokim -- Give strength to God. [Ps. 68:35]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Azariah said in the name of Rabbi Yehudah ben Rabbi Simone: When Israel perform the will of the Omnipresent they add strength to the heavenly power; as it is said [in Psalms], “To God we render strength” [Ps. 60:14]. When, however, Israel does not perform the will of the Omnipresent, they weaken, if it is possible to say so, the great power of He Who is Above; as it is written [in the Torah], “You weakened the Rock that begot you.” [Deut. 32:18].  [Lamentations Rabbah 1:33]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Psalmist says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ve-atta kadosh, yoshev tehillot Yisrael.\nAnd You are the Holy One, enthroned upon the praises of Israel. [Ps. 22:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This implies that without the praises of Israel to sustain Him, God is not enthroned.</p>\n<p>The Midrash goes further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is written [in Psalms], “Your throne is established of old.” [Ps. 93:2]. Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: Although “You are... everlasting” [Ps. 93:2], Your throne was not firmly established, nor were You known in Your world, until Your children [Moses and the people of Israel] recited the Song: [He is my God, and I will praise him; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.] [Exodus 15:1-2]  This is what the Israelites said: In truth, You existed both before and after You had created Your world, but You were standing, as it were…  Since… we recited the Song before You, only then did Your kingdom and throne become firmly established [and you could sit!]   [Exodus Rabbah 23:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk said: “Why was man created?

In the words of the Rashbi (Rabbi Shim’on bar Yochai):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-It is written [in Exodus]: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” [Ex. 15:2].

This means: “When you are My witnesses, I am God, but when you are not My witnesses, it is as if I am not God.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-It is written [in Psalms], “Unto You I lift up my eyes, O You, my enthroned One in the heavens” [Ps. 123:1]. This means: “If it weren’t for me, it is as if You would not be sitting in the heavens.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rashbi seems to be saying that, if we do not bear witness to God, God vanishes into unreality.</p>\n<p>The Midrash [Exodus Rabbah 52:5] implies God needs us to \"take over\" for Him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-[Rabbi El’azar, the son of Rabbi Yosei said:] The Holy One, blessed be He, first addressed Israel as “daughter” [then “sister”, then “mother”.]\n-[As “daughter”,] as it says [in the Book of Psalms]:\nHearken, O daughter, consider and incline your ear… [Ps. 45:11].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-When He loved Israel more, He called them “My sister”, as it says [in the Song of Songs],\nOpen to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night. [Song of Songs 5:2].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-And when He loved Israel even more, He called them “mother”, for it says [in Isaiah],<br />\nListen to Me, My people; and give ear to Me, O My mother... [Isaiah 51:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>-Thereupon Rabbi Shim’on bar Yohai arose and kissed [Rabbi El’azar] on his forehead [saying]... “If this had been the only thing I learned in life, I would have been satisfied.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Modern Hassidic Rabbi YY Jacobson writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The message here is too daring to be spoken clearly. Yet the Jewish mystics picked up on it and articulated it...  We became, as it were, mentors to [God], showing Him how darkness can be transformed into light, how imperfection is the beginning of deeper perfection, and how destruction is the commencement of renovation. And this is the message of the third holiday, the festival of Sukkot, when we celebrate the renewed relationship between God and Israel forged on Yom Kippur following their estrangement. From sister we turn into mother. From partners with God, we became teachers to God... Yet here is the catch: To become a healthy mother, you first need to be a daughter and a sister.

My mother needs me to call her.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe responded: “You are speaking about what you need. But you have not given a thought to what you are needed for.” (To Know and To Care Vol. II)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Does Hashem need us</strong>. The Lubavitcher Rebbe cautioned us in a letter that if you are going to use the word \"need\", you must explain what it means. I have found this is a confusing and sometimes misunderstood topic, so I hope to try to provide a comprehensive, clarifying, well sourced answer (that 30,000 characters allows, it’s never enough!) and provide lots of further reading to useful english-language resources for people of all levels of learning.</p>\n<p>The Artscroll Schottenstein Edition Sefardic Siddur's overview has an excellent 15 page explanation on how Hashem needs our prayer (צורך גבוה), that is well worth reading.</p>\n<p>In the original language, a vital resource is <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUxyCbZ4Ois74cto-Jrrs2a2hfy9bYzc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this kuntres</a> by HaRav Avraham Bergstein, with HaRav Manis Friedman's guidance, which has all the detail, and many sources.</p>\n<p>To cut to the chase: <strong>Yes, Hashem needs us</strong>. Not the \"things about us\", and not as a means to an end; it’s just Him. Because of this simple need for us, though, all of the \"things about us\" become equally important to Him too. It is another way of saying we and our performance of Mitzvot are <strong>essential to Him</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now the explanation, and spoiler alert: it's not going to “explain away” need, but make it deep, romantic, and infinite. It is the very core of the question of <em>what we and our performance of Mitzvot means to Him</em>, afterall…</p>\n<h1>What does \"need\" mean?</h1>\n<p>Like Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology#Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">theology of negation</a>, let’s start by asking what does it <strong>not</strong> mean? Our common usage of this word is likely to be a source of confusion and friction, when in relation to Hashem, so it's important we disregard the following types of need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It implies weakness or lack</strong>. The word need doesn't have to imply these. For example, the \"need to find meaning\" is not a weakness, but a strength, a perfection, in a human being. Secondly, anything that is lacking in us is <em>not a need</em>, it is something we <em>don’t need</em>. The “need to eat” is actually something we could and would do without!</li>\n<li><strong>Acquired needs</strong>. Needs that are superadded to us, i.e. they are not our needs, but needs imposed upon us by our Creator. Even in a finite human being, that’s not a true need</li>\n<li><strong>Needs that change with time</strong>. If it only applies when we are young but not old, it’s clearly not a real need</li>\n<li><strong>A need that may never be fulfilled</strong>. This is a flawed need. A true, perfect need must be fulfilled</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Torah talks about Hashem needing in the following ways, lowest to highest (some sources follow):</p>\n<h5>Practical need, for the Plan</h5>\n<p>Firstly, it is used in the sense of <strong>pragmatism</strong>, i.e. He needs us to do our mission in the correct way for His plans to succeed. For example, the Zohar explains that Hashem created the world to be known, and for that He needs us to know Him. The word used for this in Hebrew is generally צריך, such as in the Zohar, or the terms צורך עליון (Avodat HaKodesh), צורך מקום (Rashi), צורך גבוה (countless, back to gemara).</p>\n<h5>Necessary, the opposite of frivolous</h5>\n<p>It is also used to mean that His plan is <strong>not frivolous, or arbitrary, but necessary to Him</strong>. What He wants is essential to Him, which makes it a need. This plan He has to be known is <em>authentic</em>. This concept in Hebrew is generally referred to as עצמי.</p>\n<h5>Essential need, not secondary, with no external influence at all</h5>\n<p>Need has a higher meaning in terms of Him Himself (Essence), i.e., in the realm of some<em><strong>ones</strong></em> as opposed to the realm of some<em><strong>things</strong></em>, and here it carries the <strong>romantic and intimate connotation</strong>. Up until now, we are explaining what it means in terms of Hashem’s revelations, גילוים. However, the highest truth about Hashem is that He Himself is beyond all revelation. The Tanach and <em>Chazal</em> prefer the terms תשוקה or תאווה when discussing this essential need, to highlight that it is a need that is beyond reason, but we also use the word need in English this way too (Rashi, we will show later, connects these words to צורך in <em>Lashon Hakodesh</em> also): “My mother needs me to call her”. The mother’s need is superrational, it is bound up with her identity; her<em><strong>self</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The main point: this type of desirous need is loftier and infinitely more essential than a need that comes from lack: it is <em>nogeah</em> to me, myself! In fact, this type of need comes from within, rather than as a response, and is therefore a primary need.</p>\n<p>Lastly, to demonstrate that it is not a deficiency or imperfection, consider the husband who thinks of his wife, “if she were to disappear tomorrow, it wouldn’t matter to me, I don’t need her”. Does he sound perfect? Clearly not. Consider this deeply.</p>\n<h5>Hashem is One, <em>Ein Od Milvado</em></h5>\n<p>In <em>chassidic</em> teachings of Essence, Oneness is intimately connected with the notion of need outlined here. קודשא בריך הוא, אורייתא, וישראל. וכל חד – <em>Hashem, Torah and Yisrael are all One</em> (Zohar III 73a). This is a real need like a husband needs his wife, the someone that is the other half of his soul, <em>and</em> the object of his choice and desire: we need to be together, we belong together, we desire each other, we think and feel only for each other, we are inseparable, <em>indivisible</em>. <strong>We need each other; we are one</strong>. This is what the Torah says, right?</p>\n<p>This same Oneness unifies all the levels of need we just discussed, as His plan is to become One with us, and this is essential to Him, and it is beyond reason and not a means to an end; it’s coming from Him Himself, to us, ourselves through His Torah (and that is very romantic indeed). As Rambam states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...for the sake of Himself, or His will which is identical with His self… “Everything that is called by My name: I have created it for My glory, I have formed it; yea, I have made it” (Isa. 43:7); that is to say, everything that is described as My work has been made by Me for the sake of My will and for no other purpose (Moreh Nevuchim 3:13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What about using the word \"want\" instead?</h4>\n<p>The word “want” is also true. His Will is the Body of Torah (see Zohar III:152a) along with His Wisdom, and complements His need, which is the Soul of Torah. In other words, He is One with the Torah and Mitzvot, they are indispensable, will never change, can’t fail, and are not a means to an end, a.k.a <em>Emet</em>. At the highest rung, Hashem needs us and wants us; they are the same. When they are separated, they are no longer Godly. Needing that which one doesn’t want is not Godly, it is immature. Wanting something we don’t need is… a <em>yeitzer hara</em>. The word “want” adds the implication of choice: Hashem isn’t just Himself arbitrarily, but freely and truly.</p>\n<p>So, even though Hashem is also choosing to need, that doesn’t mean it was optional to Him, and this is understood better from the theology of Divine Free Will (and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zWdkCVrMEbc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussion</a> of רצון ובעל הרצון etc.) When we understand how authentic and true Hashem is, whatever He chooses is <em>essentially Him</em>, not optional; He doesn't change. Therefore saying “He chose to need” is only coming to strengthen the concept of Him needing it - teaching us that He has infinite, unfathomable Self Definition (see Shalah 1:8) – this does not weaken or add optionality to the argument, ch’v. He wants us to be this way as well, in our own finite way, and choose to be <em>who we are</em>, freely, becoming the masters of our own ship, real <em>mentschen</em>. This frees us to be available for others, but that is another topic.</p>\n<h1>Where in the Torah does it say He needs us?</h1>\n<p>There are countless examples of the Torah telling us explicitly and implicitly that Hashem needs us, and needs us to fulfil the Mitzvot, and the OP has brought some very important ones. Here are just 10 more to keep things brief</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Tanach does not use the word צורך, however when it comes to the plan, the Torah is replete with stress on the non-negotiable, essential seriousness of keeping Torah and Mitzvot. The higher, essential need (see above), however, <em>is</em> discussed in Tanach. The most explicit Pasuk is Shir Hashirim 7:11; אֲנִי לְדוֹדִי וְעָלַי תְּשׁוּקָתוֹ. This is in the Holy of Holies work, Shir Hashirim, our allegory for the highest <em>mashal</em> of Oneness with Hashem: the spousal Oneness, and the word for need is the one used only for husband (see Yoma 75a) and wife (Bereshit 3:16): תשוקה.  These were the last words on Rashbi’s lips when he died (Malbim)</li>\n<li>וְשָׁכַנְתִּי בְּתוֹכָם, <em>I will dwell among/within them</em> (Shemot 25:8) is a Pasuk that <em>Chazal</em> comment on as a source of our idea. <em>Dira Betachtonim</em>, the purpose of creation and Hashem’s תאווה according to Midrash, is directly connected. The Alshich explains that Hashem is not interested in a <em>Dira</em>, but the <em>Tachtonim</em>, i.e. <strong>us</strong>; needs <em>us</em>. Ramban (and others) brings up צורך גבוה on his commentary to this Pasuk, igniting an 800 year discussion on this very topic, which is even codified into the comprehensive halachic work Aruch Hashulchan in OC 89:8. More on this in point 9 below.</li>\n<li>In case we weren’t sure what צורך גבוה means, Rashi explains in no uncertain terms: לא עשאה צורך ישראל אלא צורך מקום (Sotah 38b); Hashem’s <strong>need</strong>, not ours. This perhaps sheds light on what Rashi means by “for the sake of Yisrael Hashem created the world” in the second Rashi on Torah. This is based on the word תאווה in the gemara!</li>\n<li>Many pasukim show that Hashem, speaking Himself (first person – see the <em>maamar</em> בשעה שהקדימו, יום ב׳ דחג השבועות תשי״ב), tells us that it is for Him, not us; \"Be Holy for Me\", \"My Mitzvot\" in the daily <em>Shema</em>, for example. Also in Nach, <em>pasukim</em> such as כֹּל פָּעַל ה לַמַּעֲנֵהוּ (Mishlei 16:4), which the Rambam quotes in Moreh Nevuchim 3:13 as demonstrating this point. It is for His will and Self (not ours), and is thus essential to Him. \"For His Sake\", \"<em>Lishma</em>\", \"<em>Leshem Yichud</em>\" etc</li>\n<li>It is related to the concept that Hashem, so to speak, keeps the Mitzvot (Shemot Rabbah 30:9), which tells us that the Mitzvot are not external or superficial to Him, but personal. Indeed, the <em>Kabbalists</em> and <em>Chassidim</em> teach us they are נוגע בעצמות.</li>\n<li>Rashi on Vayikra 25:43: The word <em>Avodah</em> implies that the <em>Adon</em> has a need that must be fulfilled by the <em>eved</em> (us, see 42). See also Chovot Halevavot 3, and, as per the previous point, note that this is codified in <em>halacha</em> in Rambam Hilchot Avadim 1:6 etc</li>\n<li>The logic of the Rambam, Ramchal et al. As we will show, it is a perfection, so we can say in negated terms \"however much a human can have that perfection, God has it at least as much\". The philosophy of this is discussed in Jewish Philosophy, <em>Mussar</em> and <em>Chassidus</em>, and will be brought up below. For now, the Rambam says: in Moreh Nevuchim 1:55 “Hence it follows that all perfections must really exist in God, and none of them must in any way be a mere potentiality”</li>\n<li>In case we are still unclear, the Zohar Bereshit 16 (I 23a) says in no uncertain terms, a point that was \"kept secret even from the prophets and the sages\": דודאי לא ברא קודשא בריך הוא מלתא דלאו איהו <strong>צריך</strong>, <strong>Hashem definitely didn’t create anyone or anything He doesn’t need!</strong></li>\n<li>The Lubavitcher Rebbe, concludes the “800 year discussion” on צורך גבוה - which Rabbi Shimon Jacobson <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ovit27cm5T4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> has gradually raised the need higher up towards Hashem's Essence throughout this time - by saying it very explicitly: Our fulfilment of the Torah and Mitzvot is relevant to Hashem Himself, <em>Essentially</em>. Not only is it an “absolute need” (verbatim) in terms of the revealed creation, but reaches all the way up to Him. See בשעה שהקדימו תשי״ב, and לא תהי׳ משכלה תשי״ב</li>\n<li>The wonderous point in Moreh Nevuchim, that Hashem and His Will are identical, is the very same point of <em>essential need</em> as above, expressed philosophically</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How can He need us?</h1>\n<p>Thus far, we have dealt with 2 of the most common disputes about the notion that Hashem needs us. We have shown that a true need is a perfection, not a lack. We have also disputed, quite conclusively, any claim that the Torah does not speak of Hashem's need in this way.</p>\n<p>Now we come to the important philosophical objections, namely that Hashem’s Essence is unreachable, indescribable, “no thought can apprehend Him”, and therefore all language the Torah uses to describe Hashem is “<em>lashon benei adam</em>”, a <em>mashal</em> aimed at the ear of a finite human being, and the <em>mashal</em> of need is no different.</p>\n<p>I would break this problem down into 4 parts which often get muddled:</p>\n<h4>Who Is Hashem?</h4>\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov told us that the simple Jew knows Hashem best. Why? Because for the simple Jew, there’s no need for complexity; it’s just Him!</p>\n<p>There is a very abstract philosophical concept regarding \"essence\" and \"expression/revelation\". Due to the subtle nature, it will be diluted here, but here is a quick overview:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5e3HP-4otdY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What is “essence”, and what is “revealed”</a>? These correspond to what we've been discussing, namely \"myself\" vs. \"the things about me\", respectively. Essence is “the subject in and of themselves”. <em>What</em> it is, <em>as</em> it is; who I am, me. Philosophically, this is something that is not revealable or sharable. I.e. one can’t give you a piece of themselves; myself is indivisible, it can’t be chopped up into pieces. Everything has an essence, even essences can have essences:</p>\n<p>The essence of the soul, Kabbalah teaches us, is intellect and heart – I am what I know and my character. The essence of these is will. The essence of the will of our <em>Neshama</em> is the <em>Chaya</em>, and then the <em>Yechida</em> and so on.</p>\n<p>One can ask, who am I? Am I my character and knowledge? Yes. However, they are mine, and therefore on a deeper level, they aren’t the real me, but more \"the things about me\": my expressions. Want is higher still, but even that can be viewed as not the \"real me\", but it's much closer, as what I want can be a very fundamental \"expression\" of <em>who</em> I am...</p>\n<p>So, if my body and soul are not me, then what is? We realise that anything which can be reduced to a description or property, cannot be something <em>essential</em>. I am me, saying any more is talking about the things “about me”, not me. This is also true, <em>l’havdil</em>, with regards to Hashem.</p>\n<p>Hashem “as He relates to creation”, many commentators point out, is not His true Essence, but His <em>expression</em>.</p>\n<p>We have a term in <em>Kabbalah</em> – “His existence from His Essence” – to describe the <em>Ohr Ein Sof</em> (which is also beyond comprehension - see Chagiga 18b), implying that He is above even this Infinite Light (עִלַּת עַל כָּל עִלּוֹת, Zohar).</p>\n<p>Hashem Himself. The Shalah informs us that, He Himself is absolutely beyond all description whatsoever, and a key point is that it is not just due to our lack of comprehension, but <strong>fundamentally nothing limits Hashem Himself in any way <em>whatsoever</em>. Anything is possible.</strong> The Lubavitcher Rebbe in לא תהי׳ משכלה תשי״ב explains that we are now just talking about Him, the One Who narrates the Torah, whom the simple Jew knows; דוֹדִי וְעָלַי תְּשׁוּקָתוֹ.</p>\n<p>The philosophy of Hashem’s Essence is described in great detail in Moreh Nevuchim, and dealt with at length in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3101998\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha</a>.</p>\n<h4>How do we reconcile the teachings that \"He is incomprehensible, doesn’t have any parts or attributes, and is unlike anything in creation at all\"?</h4>\n<p>Very importantly, we must put this into context. Pardes Rimonim, Tanya, Derech Mitzvotecha, all give us that context: if we find this concept of Hashem Himself and His relationship with His \"the things about Him\" hard to understand, we should look to ourselves, because <strong>man’s inability to know Hashem finds its parallel (so to speak) in his inability to know his own self</strong>. We can’t talk about our true self, which is simple, one, indivisible, indescribable... familiar? These are philosophical statements about <em>essence</em>.</p>\n<p>The lesson our <em>Chachamim</em> are stressing is that we must learn to think <em>essentially</em>, not superficially, and doing so raises us and is a moral imperative: we should view ourselves and each other as above our superficialities; as some<em><strong>ones</strong></em>. We raise our awareness and gain mastery of this through Torah study and keeping Mitzvot, elevating our conception of need, will, wisdom, love, to more Godly understandings along the way. The more we are able to raise our awareness on this point, the more demystified this theology of Hashem becomes, and the more we can understand the differences and connections between \"essence\" and \"expression\".</p>\n<p>For example, we have already discussed need on the level of \"<em>expression</em>\": we’ve mentioned the need to have a plan fulfilled. Deeper is the meaning of need that something is essential to us. When it comes to \"<em>essence</em>\", it means something deeper and ineffable: “I need to be me” or “I can’t not be me”. Or “I can’t be without you, I need you”.</p>\n<p>There is also a mysterious unity between <em>expressions</em> and <em>essence</em>, which we must take on faith (see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/tanya.asp?tdate=6/19/2023\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya Shaar HaYichud VeHaEmuna Ch. 9</a>, \"רָזָא דִמְהֵימְנוּתָא\"). More on this when we discuss Hashem’s authenticity, below.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are still differences between Him and us, and this must be studied too. Hopefully though, many will be surprised and glad to know that we don’t have to remain ignorant of Hashem, but can get much true knowledge of Him, as well as ourselves, our souls, and the connection between His Essence and ours. We achieve this from studying His Torah and performing Mitzvot, which is His loving Self-revelation to us (see Shabbat 105a). Along the way, with the guidance of our <em>Chachamim</em>, we will learn the differences too, and avoid the dangerous pitfalls into heresy, and other serious mistakes (beware; it is a very delicate subject, with a lot of history, and must be approached with a lot of awe, humility and sensitivity); having incorrect knowledge about Hashem is extremely serious, see Moreh Nevuchim 1:54. Both studies, each endless and deep, complement each other like awe and love.</p>\n<h4>What do we do about all the warnings and forbidding that our <em>Gedolim</em> made about this topic?</h4>\n<p>Each should be taken by itself, <strong>and weighed against the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133266/31534\">many statements of the <em>Gedolim</em></a> who taught the opposite</strong>, that it is vital to learn the parts of the secrets of the Torah that have been explained. By 5783, more has been explained than ever before. These explanations from our <em>Gedolim</em> have taken into account, and helped us with the warnings and dangers, such as the worries of heretical ideas like seeing Hashem as corporeal, or having eternal partners, or other serious mistakes like this, ch'v.</p>\n<p>This is weighed by the needs of the time. The Nefesh HaChaim’s teachers would never have taught these secrets to the public, but he, when worrying that people were studying it anyway and getting it wrong, felt the need to teach it (see 3:1-3). However, he also only did the absolute minimum to avoid people erring, such as “making a <em>beracha</em> in the bathroom” (because they learned that Hashem is everywhere). Now, we have way worse problems than that, and deeper explanations have been made by our <em>Chachamim</em>. Chabad <em>Chassidus</em> has made explaining this its main topic, with 7 generations of wisdom, and much of it being translated into many languages.</p>\n<p>These dangers are at least in part why the Lubavitcher Rebbe stated that if we are going to use the valid word \"need\", we must explain what it means. Meaning that by now, the <em>Chachamim</em> have been able to bring this down into good enough vessels of explanation, that it is possible to explain more of this secret to the public, with care and caution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תּוֹרָה הִיא, וְלִלְמוֹד אֲנִי צָרִיךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What is the connection between Him Himself and the גילוים, the revealed matters that we can comprehend. Is it authentic, or completely “pretend”, or something in between?</h4>\n<p><em>Note this well, as it is addressing one of the main concerns at the heart of this discussion, for many.</em></p>\n<p>The teachings that there is a difference between the way Hashem <em>relates to creation</em> and Him <em>Himself</em>, as well as the parallel differences between us and Him, can lead to phrases in our learning that make us question whether Hashem is being authentic in the way He relates to us, especially when the stress is on the difference. Whatever the lesson, <strong>Hashem is being authentic and sincere</strong>; He is One, He is True.</p>\n<p>But how can this be? How can the Infinitely Removed be Infinitely Immanent? The Rebbe Rashab (who taught us that Mitzvot are נוגע בעצמות) gives clear insight into the matter of authenticity in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/85424\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Maamar Veyadata</em></a>, which elucidates how, miraculously, everything in creation is what’s called a “perfect <em>mashal</em>” i.e. everything about the <em>Nimshal</em> is expressed in the <em>mashal</em>. The Rambam as well, in Moreh Nevuchim, when explaining that everything is a <em>mashal</em>, tells us how the <em>mashal</em> informs the <em>Nimshal</em> (through negation etc). Shaarei Orah Hakdama 6 and Shalah 13b are good <em>Kabbalistic</em> references on this point as well.</p>\n<p>So, when the Rambam says “know for sure that Hashem doesn’t have an attribute of love” he doesn't mean He <em>doesn’t love us</em>, ch'v. He means that, if you like the idea of Him loving you, and needing you, then when you find out the truth of this, which is beyond words and beyond your comprehension right now, you will find it is even better than what you thought!</p>\n<p>An helpful <em>mashal</em> I’ve heard Rabbi Friedman use:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a sophisticated father gets down on the floor, simplifies, and plays with his child, he is not <em>acting</em> or being <em>inauthentic</em>. The opposite: this is more the real essential him, than the sophistication! His love and unity with his child is essential to him. The child may not know the father “in and of himself”, but the child knows what is <em>essential</em> to the father and thus knows about the father himself*.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please note that this connection between \"expression\", \"essence\" and His Essence is very recondite and there are many areas to learn. Even the phrase “His expressions are authentic” does not do justice to the depth of that authenticity, with what we’ve been able to explain here! Keep this in mind.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how deeply we understand Him needing us, knowing that it is authentic on every level is vital. All this means that we aren't <em>reducing</em> anything by saying they \"are 'just' how Hashem relates to creation\" etc. (in fact, with what we’ve learned, we can see that such statements are meant to impress upon us how much more <em>magnified</em> the truth of these matters really is, such as Hashem’s need for us!) The \"things about Him\" are authentically Him, (mysteriously, but <em>truly</em>) connected to <em>Him</em>, and <strong>there should be <em>no barriers</em> in being in a real and soulful relationship with Him!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Common points of confusion</h3>\n<h4>Hashem never changes</h4>\n<p>This is a philosophical point. Nothing can affect Hashem because He is the only one who can bring about any affect whatsoever. We don't have any power, it is all from Him, so indeed it is a true statement: we have not got the power to affect. This is very inspiring, as Hashem's bond to us is personal to Him, owned by Him. A <em>mashal</em> is a husband telling his wife that he has come to totally own his love for her. It is an essential and free love, uninfluenced: he loves her with his very self (indeed, it is way more than love). She herself is now intrinsically important to him, and nothing can damage that bond with her. This is what <em>Chazal</em> were alluding to in Avot 5:16, a love not based on a thing. This doesn’t mean it is based on <em>nothing</em>, but no <em>thing</em>; it is based on each other. Think about this well.</p>\n<p>This more philosophical point of Hashem Himself not changing doesn't limit Him (nothing limits Him). Pardes Rimonim 6:4 shows an advanced analogy with the essence of our soul: our life force vitality is also, <em>l'havdil</em>, undifferentiated and unchanging. The only thing that changes is the vessel that it is <em>expressed</em> in, whether it be in the foot, <em>walking</em>, or in the brain, <em>knowing</em>. This is a good <em>mashal</em> towards how, in Hashem's infinite Oneness, <strong>His actions and expressions are not in any way changes</strong>, even though we are clearly in a very dynamic relationship with Him.</p>\n<p>We also mentioned that a true need never changes. This comes out from this idea of Hashem never changing too.</p>\n<h4>Rambam says explicitly that Hashem doesn’t need anything, and anyone who says so is a heretic</h4>\n<p>That’s right. We haven’t fully covered this here, but the truth is that Hashem simply needs <em>us</em>, not the \"things about us\", not as a means to an end, and the truth of this is not only beautifully romantic, but also very recondite. As we have enjoyed explaining, we are not \"the things about us\": <strong>we are just our essential selves, not <em>things</em>!</strong> We’ve also explained the difference between needs that are lacks, and how this is a true need, which is a perfection and not a lack. It is the need for us, Self to self, we are His and He is ours, and nothing will ever change that (see Gittin 57b). We must attach ourselves to Him (see Derech Hashem 1) by emulating Him, through Torah and Mitzvot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At one of my <em>sheva berachot</em>, I was describing something or other to the host, and I said \"that's my favourite thing\", and he incredulously asked \"what about your <em>kalla</em>?\", and somehow I found the answer and said <strong>\"my wife is not a <em>thing</em>!\"</strong> and everyone laughed, because it's obvious, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>The Rambam says that we cannot know why Hashem created the world, and it is heretical to say otherwise</h4>\n<p>Nothing here should contradict this. We have explained the words of our <em>Chachamim</em>, but the reality of the need, from His point of view (so to speak), and the \"why\", are beyond us. See also the discussion surrounding Megilla 25a, that the Mitzvot are “decrees of the King” and therefore important to Him in a way that is beyond reason, even though they are also good for us.</p>\n<p>We only have the <em>mashal</em>, and the sources in Torah. We are making the point that this need is <em>beyond reason</em>. We have tried not to add to what the <em>Chachamim</em> have explained, yet haven't even covered everything. Please review the provided sources!</p>\n<h4>There are statements in <em>Chazal</em> that the Mitzvot are only given to refine human beings</h4>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe deals with this at length in לא תהי׳ משכלה תשי״ב. It is true, He doesn’t need the light of the <em>Menora</em>, that is there to refine us. However, <strong>who needs us to be refined? Not us, but Him.</strong></p>\n<h4>When teaching we are relevant to Hashem Himself, the <em>Gedolim</em> say He is not bound by that, does that mean it is not a \"need\"?</h4>\n<p>This point means that the <strong>need is coming from Himself, not externally</strong>, like we have described in the point above about Hashem not changing. See <a href=\"https://bit.ly/44a5H2i\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this comment</a>, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fyh7BhaYUcQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a>, for another <em>mashal</em>.</p>\n<h4>The Torah itself says “if you are a tzaddik, what do you give Him?”</h4>\n<p>Again, this is a philosophical point. Hashem doesn’t need us to be <em>tzaddikim</em> - what are we trying to impress Him? - <strong>He just needs us to perform the Mitzvot, whether we are a <em>tzaddik</em> or not, because His bond with us is <em>essential</em></strong>. Saying the Mitzvot are for us is like saying \"our mother giving us directions to find our way home\" is for us. It will help us get home, to <em>our mother, who needs us there</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong>. \"Need\" is appropriate to describe Hashem's essential bond with us and how essential it is to Him for us to perform Mitzvot, study Torah, find Him, and become One with Him. This type of need is actually a perfection, not a lack. There are many lengthy sources that have worked to explain this idea, treating it carefully, and showing how it is a unifying idea that helps resolve theological <em>machlokeses</em>. It is a point that fits well with all of Torah when understood properly, and explains many mysteries such as what <em>Avodah</em> means, and \"for His sake\". It is an important idea to allow us, and <em>take us</em>, closer to <em>Yediyat Hashem</em> than we thought possible. When we say He needs us, we mean it in the strongest, most infinite and romantic manner imaginable; He needs <em>us</em>, not the <em>things about us</em>, and this allows intimacy and Oneness. This is Godly, this is Him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Points not touched on.

In His love and pity He Himself redeemed them, Raised them, and exalted them All the days of old. This verse is read that \"He is troubled\" by our pain, but it's written that He \"is not troubled\" be our pain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our sages explain there is a level when He is pained, and a level where He isn't pained.</p>\n<p>One analogy given to explain the relationship is like a parent and a child.\nThe parent has an essential, unchanging love for the child. Nothing the child does can add or subtract from this love.</p>\n<p>The parent wants or \"needs\" the child to make good choices because it is in the child's best interest. Yet, there is nothing inherently important to the parent about the child's choices.</p>\n<p>For example, in one sense it doesn't affect your parent if you get an A or an F on a test.

    "content": "# Is “breath of life” in Genesis 2:7 is the same as spirit?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does this mean that God breathed his spirit into Adam giving him life.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The exact nature of what God blew into man is discussed by some of the commentators.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=Sforno&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sfrono</a> writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>G’d personally blew a soul of life into man, a life force which had been readied to absorb what was previously called צלם אלוקים, “the image of G’d.” This has been attested to in Job 32,8 ונשמת שדי תבינם,”by means of the breath of the attribute of Shaddai You endowed them with understanding.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“He blew into his nostrils a living soul.” G-d personally blew the breath of life into the human being, something He had not done for any of His other creatures. Why was all this necessary? This was in order to enable man to have the wisdom, i.e. holy spirit, to enable him when viewing all the animals to name them correctly after having discerned how each was different from the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his discussion of the nature of the soul, Rabbeinu Bahya <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The soul of intelligence is something exclusive to man, something he shares with beings in the higher worlds, beings which live forever in their sacred domains The seat of this soul is in man’s brain, and it is generally referred to as נשמה. This is what the Torah described in our verse as the נשמת חיים which G-d “blew” into Adam’s nostrils.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> doesn't limit himself to some notion of soul which is totally separate from God. He talks of a life-force. In fact, he writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>G’d blew into man some of the spirit prevailing in the highest regions on earth...man’s life force is called here נשמה, to alert us to the fact that the origin of this life force is not physical, has not been supplied by earth, in fact could not have been supplied by earth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While other commentators write at length about the nature of the soul (such as the Ramban) that was blown in, I haven't found one that says explicitly that the soul is some \"part\" of God that is synonymous with the spirit of God mentioned in 1:1, though it is somehow an image of God. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=Alshich&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alshich</a> spends a bunch of time discussing how whatever is blown in is still connected to God (which would make it identical with some essence still \"inside\" God) and he speaks of a neshama elyona (a superior soul).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p><strong>The meaning of Genesis 2:7</strong></p>\n\n<p>Usually the term ruach elohim is translated to mean “the spirit of G-d,” Actually ruach, in this context, means “wind.” Likewise, elohim means powerful because G-d is more powerful than anything else. Thus the correct translation reads “a strong wind,” and not a spirit. </p>\n\n<p>Verses 1:26 states, “Let us make man in our demut. Verse 1:27 relates that “G-d made man in His tzelem, in the tzelem of G-d, He made him.”</p>\n\n<p>The word demut means “likeness.” G-d created man in His “likeness.” But G-d has no body, so man cannot have G-d’s “likeness.” The meaning of tzelem is “shape” or “form.” A divine “shape?” 12th-century sage, Moses Maimonides felt that the two denotes the essence of two things. What is the essence of man? His intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 2:7: “The L-rd G-d formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a nefesh chayah.” Onkelos does not renders this as “a living being,” but implies the characteristics of man, his ruach m’mal’la, “one with the power of speech,” a phrase denoting a certain level of intelligence. The targumic interpretation and Egyptian Jewish philosopher Philo understood this intellect to be “the breath of life” in his Specialibus Legibus 4:123. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The term ruach Elohim is a wind that hovered over the water. The Bible is exclaiming that “G-d created a wind that blew upon the water.” Similarly, the phrase tzelem Elohim, “the image of G-d,” Elohim means “awesome.” G-d created people with the awesome power of intelligence. Thus, G-d states in Genesis 1:26: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”. Maimonides felt that this denotes intelligence. That a person should develop his or her ability to think because that is like G-d. Thus, we are created in the image of G-d. A Divine Spark. G-d also gave man a soul, the neshama. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Rambam hold of eternal punishment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In chapter 3 of Hilchos Teshuva, Rambam says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The following individuals do not have a portion in the world to come. Rather, their [souls] are cut off and they are judged for their great wickedness and sins, <strong>forever</strong> ( לעולם ולעולמי עולמים) [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to imply that those individuals will receive eternal judgement/retribution.</p>\n\n<p>However, in chapter 8, he says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The retribution beyond which there is no greater retribution is that the soul will be cut off and not merit this life as [Numbers 15:31] states: \"This soul shall surely be cut off. His sin shall remain upon him.\"\n  <strong>This refers to the obliteration of the soul</strong> [...] All the synonyms for nullification and destruction are used to refer to it for it is the [ultimate] <strong>nullification</strong> after which there is no renewal and the [ultimate] loss which can never be recovered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this it seems that the souls which are cut off are destroyed or nullified  (so they simply cease to exist) -  and so do not actually exist forever to receive eternal judgement/punishment.</p>\n\n<p>How can we reconcile these statements?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think the Rambam is quite clear in Hilkhos Teshuvah 8:5. We do get a hint in 8:1, \"פִרְעוֹן הָרְשָׁעִים הוּא שֶׁלֹּא יִזְכּוּ לְחַיִּים אֵלּוּ אֶלָּא יִכָּרְתוּ וְיָמוּתוּ. -- the payment of the wicked is, that they will not share in such life, but will suffer excision and eternal death.\"</p>\n<p>But in halakhah 5, the Rambam states that all the prophetic discussion of what we call \"gehennom\"* is a metaphoric description of ceasing to exist. To quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַנְּקָמָה שֶׁאֵין נְקָמָה גְּדוֹלָה מִמֶּנָּה שֶׁתִּכָּרֵת הַנֶּפֶשׁ וְלֹא תִּזְכֶּה לְאוֹתָן הַחַיִּים שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">במדבר טו:לא</a>) \"הִכָּרֵת תִּכָּרֵת הַנֶּפֶשׁ הַהִיא עֲוֹנָהּ בָּהּ\". וְזֶה הָאֲבַדּוֹן הוּא שֶׁקּוֹרִין אוֹתוֹ הַנְּבִיאִים דֶּרֶךְ מָשָׁל \"בְּאֵר שַׁחַת\" וַ\"אֲבַדּוֹן\" וְ\"תָפְתֶּה\" וַ\"עֲלוּקָה\" וְכָל לְשׁוֹן כְּלָיָה וְהַשְׁחָתָה קוֹרְאִין לוֹ. לְפִי שֶׁהִיא הַכְּלָיָה שֶׁאֵין אַחֲרֶיהָ תְּקוּמָה וְהַהֶפְסֵד שֶׁאֵינוֹ חוֹזֵר לְעוֹלָם:</p>\n<p>The vengeance, than which there is none greater is, that the soul will be cut off and will obtain no share in that life, even as it is said: \"That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 15:31</a>). And this is what the prophets call figuratively by different names, such as, \"pit of destruction\", \"burning flame\", \"leech\", and by every word which means decay and destruction is it called, because it is an expression of terminating decay from which there is no regeneration and a loss which remains forever un-returned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, there is tangenial mention in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhos Teshuvah 3:6</a>. In introducing his list of heretics, the Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֵלּוּ הֵן שֶׁאֵין לָהֶן חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא אֶלָּא נִכְרָתִים וְאוֹבְדִין וְנִדּוֹנִין עַל גֹּדֶל רִשְׁעָם וְחַטָּאתָם לְעוֹלָם וּלְעוֹלְמֵי עוֹלָמִים.</p>\n<p>And these are the people who have no part toward the World to Come. Rather, they are cut off and destroyed, and are judged on the greatness of their evil and their sin for all eternity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Heretics are \"cut off and destroyed\". So then how does the Rambam continue to say that are they judged for all eternity? Because they do not exist for the rest of eternity. Note the Rambam does not say they will be <strong>punished</strong> for all eternity, but that \"they are <strong>judged</strong> ... for all eternity\". The judgment of being cut off is a decision of eternal consequence.</p>\n<p>Which makes sense thinking about it from the Rambam's first principles. In his worldview (c.f. 8:1), the reward of the World to Come is inherent in the World to Come containing fewer barriers between the soul (the term used is nefesh, which likely matters) and the Creator than we have in this world.</p>\n<p>In his commentary on the Mishnah, introduction to Pereq Cheileq (Sanhedrin ch. 10 or 11), the Rambam cites Reish Laqish (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.8b.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 8b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.3b.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 3b-4a</a>), who says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין גיהנם לעתיד לבא אלא הקדוש ברוך הוא מוציא חמה מנרתיקה ומקדיר רשעים נידונין בה וצדיקים מתרפאין בה ... דכתיב (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.3.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מלאכי ג:יט</a>) \"[כִּֽי]־הִנֵּ֤ה הַיּוֹם֙ בָּ֔א בֹּעֵ֖ר כַּתַּנּ֑וּר וְהָי֨וּ כָל־זֵדִ֜ים וְכָל־עֹשֵׂ֤ה רִשְׁעָה֙ קַ֔שׁ וְלִהַ֨ט אֹתָ֜ם הַיּ֣וֹם הַבָּ֗א אָמַר֙ ה' .צְבָקוֹת אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹא־יַעֲזֹ֥ב לָהֶ֖ם שֹׁ֥רֶשׁ וְעָנָֽף\" -- לא שורש בעולם הזה ולא ענף לעולם הבא.</p>\n<p>There is no gehennom in the future-to-come. Rather HaQadosh Barukh Hu takes the sun out of its sheath, and heats with it. Wicked people are judged by it, and righteous people are healed by it. ... \"For, here! The era is coming, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that do wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall set them ablaze, said the Hashem Tzevaqos, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.3.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malachi 3:19</a>) -- No root will remain [of the wicked] in this world, and no branch for the World to Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(* The Rambam doesn't discuss this that I know of, but using the name \"gehennom\" is definitely metaphoric. It is named for Gei Ben Hinom -- the Valley of the son of Hinnom, a place outside Yerushalayim where the Canaanites practiced child sacrifice. Today it's between the Old City and the Artist Colony and boasts a venue for Rock concerts. Make of that what you will <grin>.)</p>\n\n\n",

(Sefaria):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Yehuda and Shmuel were standing on the roof of the synagogue that was destroyed and rebuilt in Neharde’a. Rav Yehuda said to Shmuel: What can I do? I need to urinate. Shmuel said to him: Shinnana, hold your penis, so that the water does not fall onto the synagogue roof, and urinate outward, away from the synagogue. \n  ‏The Gemara asks: How could Rav Yehuda do so? But isn’t it taught in a baraita... ‏Abaye says: The Sages rendered the halakhic status of this situation like that of a troop of marauders... <strong>Here too, in this incident involving Rav Yehuda, since he is afraid he will not come to have sexual thoughts</strong>.\n  The Gemara asks: And what fear is there here, in the case of Rav Yehuda?... And if you wish, say that the awe of <strong>the Divine Presence that dwells in the synagogue is upon Rav Yehuda</strong>. And if you wish, say that the awe of his Master, God, is upon him...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From here we can infer when the Torah scroll is open/read -and ordinarily in a synagogue which adds to the assumption that the divine presence is present- we are not suspect of <em>hirhurim</em> (AKA yetzer ha’ra). </p>\n\n<p>(While being used to explain the <em>halachic</em> permissibility of a woman’s qualification for being one of the seven <em>‘olim</em> (since the reading of the Torah is being done in a shul; Meg. 23a), other various <em>halachic</em> applications were made with the above forming the basis, most notable -perhaps- was the Chida (Marit Ayin, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Marit_HaAyin_on_Niddah.13a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">op cit.</a>). R.

    "content": "# Slavery, an apparent contradiction?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>In the Exodus, G-d hears the suffering of Israel as follows:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Israelites were groaning under the bonding and cried out, and their cry for help from the bondage rose to G-d” (Exod 2:23); “I will free you from the labors of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched hand” (Exod 6:6).</p>\n<p>“I established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners. I now heard the moaning of the Israelites because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant” (Exod 6:4-5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What seems to bother G-d is not the institution of slavery itself, but that the divine plan that Abraham’s descendants are being forestalled by Egypt. This is an affront to G-d and not an affront to human justice. Thus, it appears that the freedom of Israel is a pre-request for true service to G-d.</p>\n<p>The notion of debt slavery for a Hebrew is permitted. Actually, the slaves of Jews were more akin to an indentured servant. The principles are explained clearly in Leviticus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If your kinsmen under you continues in straits and must give himself over to you, do not subject him to the treatment of a slave”(Lev 25:39). “For they are my slaves, whom I  freed from the land of Egypt; they may not give themselves over into slavery” (25:42).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>It appears that the treatment of a Hebrew slave stands in stark contrast to that of a non-Israelite:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is from the nations round about you that you may acquire male and female slaves. . . . These shall become your property: you may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property for all time. Such you may treat as slaves. But as for your Israelites kinsmen, no one shall rule ruthlessly over the other” (Lev 25:44-46).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This implies that the non-Israelite slave may be dealt with \"ruthlessly\" and even be inherited over multiple generations. Abraham’s covenant seems to be the only thing that concerns G-d.</p>\n<p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Shouldn't Israel, who narrowly escaped bondage be sick of slavery? Why is the enslavement of an Israelite, a fellow Jew permanent? Shouldn't the institution of slavery (as condoned in the Bible) be abolished altogether? Doesn't G-d take a strong stance on the issue, and if so, why didn’t G-d freed African slaves in America? Does it seem that G-d’s special favor is only for the Jews? Or does the Torah only ban one form of slavery?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>George Washington, a slaveholder, was a part of the “new Israel” movement of Christianity. Did the Leviticus quote give him the right to treat his non-Christian black slaves \"ruthlessly\"?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>It is true that the Torah most certainly allows slavery, but the  legislation of a slaves' life is made more comfortable than that of other cultures, so much so that rabbis later said, \"he who acquires a slave secures a master over himself.\" If so, why does the Torah seem to say that we can deal \"ruthlessly\" with non-Israelite slaves?

The progeny of our father Abraham,\nhowever, the people of Israel upon whom God bestowed the goodness of\nthe Torah, commanding them to keep the laws of goodness, are merciful\ntoward all creatures. So too, in speaking of the divine attributes,\nwhich he has commanded us to imitate, the psalmist says: \"His mercy is\nover all his works\" (Psalm 145:9).

If the master does not desire to free him, the court invalidates his ownership of him, and the slave is free to go on his way.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is certainly more to be said about the topic, but it is perhaps a starting point.</p>\n<p>I also think it is important to point out that the translation \"treat slaves ruthlessly\" is not entirely accurate. One may work them very hard, but one may not cause them serious bodily harm. This is not to say that slavery is not terrible on its own, but they <em>are</em> extended basic human rights. Perhaps similar to the rights of a prisoner today.</p>\n<p>I think it worth looking more into the requirement that a slave partially convert. It seems to me that both Jewish and non-Jewish slavery was seen by Torah to be used as a rehabilitative or educational process. Again, not because this is necessarily the best way to educate someone, but given the realities, this was sometimes the best option available.</p>\n<p>If someone, or a segment of society, is hostile to living a civilized life, you need to coheres them to act properly until they become refined. (Like a thief being forced to act as a servant, preparing them to reenter society).</p>\n<p>A society that accepts slavery should at least learn to use it as a tool for good, until the time when it can be abolished.</p>\n<p>It is hard to accept at times, but unfortunately, the only way to improve the world is one step at a time.</p>\n<p>Likewise, war is obviously not an ideal, and yet we have laws of war.</p>\n<p>Also, I think it is worth adding that we have not really abolished slavery in the Western World, we have just outsourced it to places out of sight, where conditions are often worse. Most of our goods are produced by actual or virtual slaves. Does this really make our modern world more just?</p>\n\n\n",

The 23rd judge's machinations would end up 'thwarting' G-d's plan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.17a.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 17a</a> (translation modified from Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב כהנא סנהדרי שראו כולן לחובה פוטרין אותו מ\"ט כיון דגמירי הלנת דין למעבד ליה זכותא והני תו לא חזו ליה</p>\n<p>Rav Kahana says: In a Sanhedrin where all the judges saw fit to convict the defendant, they acquit him. What is the reasoning? Since it is learned as a tradition that suspension of the trial overnight is necessary in order to create a possibility of acquittal, and as those judges all saw fit to convict him they will not see any further possibility to acquit him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The case here is the initial discussions about whether he is guilty or innocent. Everyone is supposed to try to find a way to acquit the person tried, and they wouldn't decide the outcome until the next day so that they could consider the arguments for acquittal (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 4:1</a>). If no one had any argument to acquit, then he would be acquitted automatically, because they weren't able to consider overnight any arguments in favor of his innocence. If the 23rd judge thinks the defendant is guilty, he can't just vote to acquit him, because the whole point of the discussion was to bring up arguments for acquittal; he has to actually have an actual argument for acquittal so that the other judges can consider it overnight. And if you do find an argument for acquittal, that's the whole point of the process.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why not use the Yamim Nora’im tune when reading the Torah at Yom Kippur mincha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many (all?) Ashkenazi communities have a different and distinctive tune used for <em>keriat hatorah</em> on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur morning (and in some communities also on Hoshana Rabbah and Simchat Torah).</p>\n\n<p>However, I’ve observed that this tune is not used at <em>mincha</em> of Yom Kippur. Why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I've heard two answers from a respectable rabbi, zt\"l. Even after death, I'd rather keep his name and location anonymous.</p>\n\n<p>One answer I heard is that the High Holiday tune has a \"mode\" of \"royalty\" and \"joy\". This type of tune is inappropriate when reading about illicit marriages that people should avoid. (I will add in, B\"N, as to why this section is read for afternoon of Yom Kippur, later.) As I don't completely understand this mood of \"joy\" in the tune, I have trouble appreciating or understanding this answer, so, perhaps, accept it (or not) for what it is.</p>\n\n<p>The second answer makes a bit more sense to me. We have to understand the whole reason as to why Yom Kippur afternoon is getting a Torah reading in the first place as well as what was read. According to <a href=\"https://beureihatefila.com/files/2014-02-07_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> reading the Torah on Yom Kippur afternoon was a much later addition first mentioned in a Braita and later in Bavli Talmud Megila 31a.</p>\n\n<p>We know that the Torah is not read on Mincha of any other Yom Tov. So, this leads to the question - is the reading of Torah on Yom Kippur in imitation of Shabbat or a fast day? Read the rest of the article which cites mainly a debate by Ismar Ellenbogen. Regardless, it is clear that the reading during the afternoon is not particular for the occasion of Yom Kippur. Thus, the tune used is not the Yom Kippur tune but the same tune used for Shabbat and fast days.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I feel that the reading is more in line with it being a fast day. Support for this is thinking, perhaps, is in the idea that the brachot for the haftarah end in <em>Magen David</em> which is more indicative of a fast day. However, even the article debates the origin and need of any haftarah in the afternoon on Yom Kippur at all.</p>\n\n<p>Anotehr possible idea is in viewing the article, it was common to finish the reading of Devarim on Yom Kippur prior to the advent of <em>Simchat Torah</em>. While I see that you mentioned that some havethe custom of using the High Holiday tune on Simchat Torah, I have found that this is a \"less\" common minhag. At least, I have seen this done in a minority of roughly 60 various Nusahc Ashkenaz shuls that I have attended throughout about 50 years. I think that one of the reasons places are doing it is to somehow hold on to the \"flavor\" of the previous month's melodies. However, I don't think this <em>Yamim Nora'im</em> tune is appropriate for <em>Simchat Torah</em> as the spirit of the day has nothing to do with the concepts of awe and royalty, assuming that's the main reason for the special tune, in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

He would eat the first to leave the better-quality animal for Shabbat, which continually rendered his eating an act of honoring Shabbat. (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand there is a concept of :מעלין בקודש ואין מורידין and therfore it would be inappropriate to take something designated for Shabbos and downgrade it to weekday. (Perhaps the case of Shammai is different since the food was not yet actually used on Shabbos, just designated for Shabbos and הזמהה לאו מילתא although, if so, perhaps having Shabbos leftovers during the week would be a problem...)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The idea of \"<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9_%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מעלין בקדושה ולא מורידים</a>\" (see <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9_%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WIKI's summary in Hebrew</a>) is not universal, it applies only to a limited set of holy objects, Mitzvos and people:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>תשמישי קדושה (Religious articles) like Teffilin, Torah scroll, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Channukah lights - we go from 1 to 8</p></li>\n<li><p>Kohen Gadol and King's wife.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As Shabbos clothes are not \"Religious articles\", this rule does not apply to it.

    "content": "# Sukkot water libations - from the Torah, from Sinai, or from the Rabbis?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a disagreement recorded in the Mishna, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Zevachim.13.6?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 13:6</a>, regarding the <a href=\"https://www.templeinstitute.org/water_libation_festival.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkot water libation</a>. R' El'azar includes this ceremony in the list of Temple activities that are prohibited by the Torah to perform outside the Temple, in this case, specifically on Sukkot. His position opposes the default position in the mishna (the <em>tana kama</em>), which does not include the water libation in this prohibition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obadiah_Bartenura\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Ovadia MiBartenura</a> comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...<br />\nדסבר ניסוך המים בחג דאורייתא היא הלכך מחייב עלה בחוץ ואין הלכה כר״א בכולה מתניתין ונסוך המים בחג לאו דאורייתא היא אלא הלכה למשה מסיני</p>\n<p>... for he holds that the water libation of Sukkot is from the Torah, so he says that one is liable for performing it outside [the Temple]. And the accepted law does not follow R' El'azar throughout this mishna. And the water libation is not from the Torah, but a <em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>my translation</sup></p>\n<p>I was curious how the distinction between the water libation's source being in the [Written] Torah and being a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_given_to_Moses_at_Sinai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em></a>, which are both kinds of Divine legislation, would bear on whether or not the prohibition of outside services would apply to it, as R' Ovadia seems to imply, so I looked at the Gemara on this Mishna (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.110b.4-6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 110b</a>). There, to resolve a technical point in R' El'azar's position, the Gemara concludes that <em>he</em> must hold that the source of the water libation is a <em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em>. The Gemara doesn't appear to address the <em>tana kama</em>'s position regarding the water libation's source. From the back-and-forth in the Gemara, it seems that if its source was derived from the Written Torah, as cited there to R' Akiva, the prohibition of doing it outside the Temple would apply even <em>more</em> widely.</p>\n<p>So now, I don't understand R' Ovadia's last line. It seems to imply that the position that the water libation is a <em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em> is the accepted law, <em>in contradistinction to R' El'azar</em>, who holds that it's \"from the Torah.\" If this reading of him is correct, it directly contradicts the Gemara, which concludes that R' El'azar must hold that it's a <em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em>. <strong>Is this the right reading of R' Ovadia? If so, how does he understand the Gemara?</strong></p>\n<p>Or, we could read R' Ovadia as ascribing this statement about <em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em> specifically to R' El'azar. I think this is a tortured reading of this comment, though it's consistent with the Gemara. <strong>In this case, why throw this line in at all?</strong> Unless you get to the technical point discussed in the Gemara, which is brought up neither in our mishna nor in R' Ovadia's commentary on it, this distinction doesn't make a difference to the prohibition the mishna's discussing.</p>\n<p>Or, we could read R' Ovadia as concluding that R' Ela'zar and the <em>tana kama</em> agree that the water libation is a <em>halacha leMoshe miSinai</em>, though they disagree about whether the prohibition of doing it outside applies. <strong>If so, on what basis does the <em>tana kama</em> disagree? And again, why throw this line in at all?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finally, what <em>does</em> the <em>tana kama</em> hold regarding the source of the water libation?</strong> It would be easiest to say that the <em>tana kama</em> holds that it's Rabbinic legislation, so the Torah prohibition of outside performance can't apply. This seems to be implied in the first part of R' Ovadia's comment. <strong>If so, is this corroborated somewhere else in the Mishna or Gemara?</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.110b.6?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi comments</a> on the Gemara's conclusion that \"everyone holds that it's from the Torah,\" but perhaps that just means everyone mentioned in the discussion in the Gemara - R' El'azar and R' Akiva - and not truly <em>everyone</em>, such as our <em>tana kama</em>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Zevachim.13.6.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos Yom Tov</a> discusses some of you issues you raise and therefore gives a different interpretation.</p>\n<p>Short summary: Rabbi Elazar is only arguing about the necessary amount of water to be liable.

As a result, the Karaites (9th-century) adopted many Sadducee-ideas including the notion that the Shabbat beings in Saturday morning and ends on Sunday morning. The Pharisees couldn't disagree more. Shabbat begins on Friday evening (18 minutes in advance for women to light the candles) and ends on Saturday evening (sometimes 42 minutes after sunset). Tradition has it that the Pharisees follow both the Written and Oral Law as received from Moshe at Sinai. The Pharisees claim that the Sadducees, and thus, Karaites opted to reform Judaism by removing the Oral Torah, opting to only follow a literal reading of the Torah. They [the Sadducees] rejected, for example, the prophets and Talmud(s).[1] They also claim that the Sadducees (tzidukim) were named after its founder Tzadok. But the Sadducees held that it was they who followed the Torah, which, in their opinion, did not contain the Oral law; that the Oral Law was a later development by the Pharisees (and the rabbis).[2] They argue that their name tzedek means “the righteous ones,” and that the name for the Pharisees was derived from the root p-r-sh, which means “separated.” In other words, “those who separated themselves from the Torah.”[3]</p>\n\n<p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p>What, if any, of the Sadducees and Karaites position is correct, regarding these matters? </p>\n\n<p>Sources, please.</p>\n\n<p>PS I agree with the pharisaic position but the question is thought-provoking.</p>\n\n<p>[1] Avot d’Rabbi Natan I, chapter 5, and Avot d’Rabbi Natan II, chapter 10.</p>\n\n<p>[2] This is also the position of Louis Finkelstein in “The Pharisees.”</p>\n\n<p>[3] In the New Testament, the Christian claim the term Pharisee means “hypocrite,” but this is not true.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Since both (all) groups you mentioned accept the written Torah as divine (to say nothing of other shared social/cultural similarities) there are certainly many many items of agreement. I would presume all would generally prohibit eating pork, adultery, or worshiping idols and so forth. Nevertheless, as these groups mutually identified themselves as distinct from each other the emphasis is going to be on contrasting with their opponents positions.  I am confident you will not find many Rabbinic writings cataloging points of agreement with competing ideologies, and to do so doesn't seem too practical.</p>\n\n<p>If you mean to ask if there are any areas where the Pharisaic/Rabbinic parties adopted the position or accepted the arguments of the Sadducees or Karaites, the ideology of fidelity to tradition/oral law would make this very difficult to transpire consciously and even harder to state frankly that this had been done (even if it had)\n.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara asks: But wasn’t it\n  taught in a baraita: His sins are arranged before him? The Gemara\n  answers: What is the meaning of arranged?

But if he survives the year,\n  he can be assured that his good deeds protected him and ensured for\n  him a share in the World-to-Come. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Know\n  that it is so, as the whole world is hungry due to refraining from\n  conjugal relations, and he is satiated since he emitted semen and his\n  lust was subdued. Since the issue was involuntary and not intentional,\n  it is a sign that he has merited divine compassion. When Rav Dimi came\n  from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said: Seeing semen on Yom Kippur is\n  a sign that one will live a long life, grow, and raise others.

She said as an example, \"I am not Shomeret Shabbat, I don't eat kosher, and I know that I'm going to continue this way. (<strong>Why</strong> she wants to is a separate complex issue.) The same can be said for almost all the people coming in the shul today. These are 3-day-per year shul attenders. They're coming here all pretending to ask forgiveness from God for the sins that they committed, but they're insincere. They all know that as soon as Yizkor is over, they will drive back home on Yom Kippur, knowing that it's forbidden to do so. But, they choose to continue that way, anyway. So, what's the point?\"</p>\n\n<p>Granted, I tried to explain that maybe all God wants from you is to ask forgiveness for those sins that you really are sorry about and that you feel that you can change. But, that didn't seem to work, because she thinks it's a whole process and it involves \"everything or nothing\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure that there are various halachic or maybe Jewish psychological books that can explain how to answer this point. Can anyone suggest any ideas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a difficult question, because there is no right answer, and what will touch one person will not resonate with another.

Being on a path to be a better person is more important that where one stands on that path. As the Kotzker Rebbe once answered when asked if it is better to be on top or in the bottom of a ladder: \"it depends which direction you go\". As such, asking for forgiveness of sins one has committed <strong>and wants to change</strong> is already a massive step forward. And even a teen should have some of these (maybe show her the commentaries on the <em>vidduy</em> and how many sins are alluded to in each sentence).</p></li>\n<li><p>As Rav <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Salanter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisroel Salanter</a> writes in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14564&pgnum=47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sixth letter of Ohr Israel</a>, <strong>one gets the biggest punishment for the easiest things</strong>. Someone struggling with two issues, a big one and a small one, will get the largest spiritual punishment for the issues which would be easiest to fix, because he is most guilty for not fixing theses. As such, explain that she could pick one or two easy things to improve and resolve to work on these by acknowledging her past failures, asking for forgiveness and resolving to do better</p></li>\n<li>Shabbat and <em>kashrut</em> are big big things and one should not minimize it. But there is <em>bein adam lamakom</em> and <strong><em>bein adam la'havero</em></strong>. If she feels not ready to move on the first category, there is plenty to do on the second.

    "title": "When Did Sukkot Lose Its Status As \"THE\" Hag?",
    "content": "# When Did Sukkot Lose Its Status As \"THE\" Hag?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Torah it seems like a few of the Hagim get some special status as being particularly significant. Pesah gets a lot of attention and a lot of rituals, Rosh Hashannah seems barely worth mentioning, and Yom Kippur seems much more tied into the temple than to a synagogue service. But Sukkot is a Hag that seems like it's rather important as it's one of the Shalosh Regalim, and as the Tankah continues it is referred to as \"THE\" Hag. Not only that, in the end times it's the one hag that the entire world will celebrate.</p>\n\n<p>Zecharia 14: 16</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טז  וְהָיָה, כָּל-הַנּוֹתָר מִכָּל-הַגּוֹיִם, הַבָּאִים,\n  עַל-יְרוּשָׁלִָם; וְעָלוּ מִדֵּי שָׁנָה בְשָׁנָה, לְהִשְׁתַּחֲוֺת\n  לְמֶלֶךְ יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת, וְלָחֹג, אֶת-חַג הַסֻּכּוֹת.    16 And it shall\n  come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came\n  against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King,\n  the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah there seems to be a special status given, like how the entire Torah was read to the people throughout the 7 days</p>\n\n<p>Nehemiah 8</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יז  וַיַּעֲשׂוּ כָל-הַקָּהָל הַשָּׁבִים מִן-הַשְּׁבִי סֻכּוֹת,\n  וַיֵּשְׁבוּ בַסֻּכּוֹת--כִּי לֹא-עָשׂוּ מִימֵי יֵשׁוּעַ בִּן-נוּן כֵּן\n  בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, עַד הַיּוֹם הַהוּא; וַתְּהִי שִׂמְחָה, גְּדוֹלָה\n  מְאֹד.    17 And all the congregation of them that were come back out of\n  the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days\n  of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel\n  done so. And there was very great gladness. יח  וַיִּקְרָא בְּסֵפֶר\n  תּוֹרַת הָאֱלֹהִים, יוֹם בְּיוֹם--מִן-הַיּוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן, עַד הַיּוֹם\n  הָאַחֲרוֹן; וַיַּעֲשׂוּ-חָג שִׁבְעַת יָמִים, וּבַיּוֹם הַשְּׁמִינִי\n  עֲצֶרֶת כַּמִּשְׁפָּט.  {פ}   18 Also day by day, from the first day\n  unto the last day, he read in the book of the Law of God. And they\n  kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn\n  assembly, according unto the ordinance. {P}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my question is...What happened to the status of Sukkot? We seem to have lost any connection to the reading of the entire Torah, and now have \"Simhat Torah\" which is the finishing of the reading of the Torah...but this only happens because now we have two days of Hag. So that seems accidental rather than purposeful.</p>\n\n<p>Also most Jews seem to clock out of Sukkot altogether, it's like they are too exhausted from Yom Kippur to give sukkot any thought. And the Jews who manage to make it to sukkot often celebrate it in a much diminished form, no longer sleeping/dwelling in the Sukkah and instead viewing it as a place that one is merely required to snack in. The Talmud also talks about the great parties and antics that would happen during sukkot, and all that seems to not exist anymore as well. We have Selihot festivals, special hazzanim for the \"High Holydays,\" ans a litany of other stuff that we don't have for Sukkot. Heck, there aren't even very many sukkot specific songs, whereas there are all sorts of special songs and melodies for every other hag.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, when did Sukkot lose its status among religious Jewry to the point that it seems like the least of the Holydays.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that many of your assumptions are incorrect. It's hard for me to offer the most appropriate reaction without knowing where you live and what you have experienced. But, I have lived in about 5 different communities and I have spent Succot in Israel. I can tell you from personal observance that Succot has far from lost its status and a big deal is made of it, but in different ways than you or the Talmud describes.</p>\n\n<p>Much energy is spent on selling, selecting and buying 4 minim. I know someone who buys and sells these items. He prepares about 6 months in advance. It is arduous work viewing some of the produce, dealing with sellers, getting a good pre, getting the inventory, arranging it, packing it for shipment, and loads of other things that you and I as an average consumer wouldn't care to do, and we know little about what happens behind the scenes. </p>\n\n<p>From the consumer aspect - people are happy and excited when they buy their 4 minim. OK, they may not always be thrilled about the expense, but, they spend what they can afford (most - some, agreed will overspend beyond their means, but if they do, this is what makes them joyful.)</p>\n\n<p>I put up my succah and it gives me much pleasure, even if it is getting a bit more physically difficult to do so. People spend hundreds of dollars on a nice suitable succah and more money decorating it. And, they do it joyfully. Some people still sleep in the succah, but, again, one is exempt from doing so if it cause \"stress\" such as sever cold or rain, etc. I don't sleep, but, I do my work there. I sit there with my laptop and phone and books and whatever I need to write papers, articles and such.</p>\n\n<p>I shop and I cook - a lot. I plan the menu in mid-Elul and try to determine who is coming, what they like, what allergies their kids or hey have, etc. That's a <strong>big</strong> deal and quite some effort. Certainly sounds like it's getting its due prominence.</p>\n\n<p>I got your point about the special <em>Chazannim</em>. I can't completely argue with that. My shul has a year-round <em>chazzan</em>, so it's not agood comparison. But, even within the frum community, on Rosh Hashannah, even with a professional chazzan, they have their limit. You want to be done by 1 - 1:30 PM (Chaba\"d and a few others have their own deal, here.) Point is, people, are looking to get out at a decent time, even on Rosh Hashanna. Moreso, on 3 Regalim, so they're not really hiring a special chazzan. Besides, most of the people there can do the job, themselves. And, many shuls have limited budgets, too. Otherwise, they would probably have hired a year-round chazzan. In short, not a good criteria to judge this in your question.</p>\n\n<p>About Simchat Torah - there's a long history as to how that occurred, which I don't want to get into, here. And, in Israel it occurs together with Shmini  Atzeret, so the \"two day\" claim is only outside Israel. I don't think it's gotten any less notice than the rest of Succot. It's just a different <strong>type</strong> of Simcha going on. I don't think your making a good comparison or claim. The joy on Simchat Torah doesn't diminish from the importance of the rest of Succot.</p>\n\n<p>I've made my \"counter\" claims. Rather than offer rebuttal, maybe you can edit your question so that we can get a better sense of what you have actually seen in your community. I think the historical aspect you have put in is irrelevant to the essence of your question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does 'thou shalt not steal' refer to general theft or specifically to kidnapping?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I admit that I sometimes just can't keep my fingers to myself. I felt thirsty so I took a refreshing ginger ale from my neighbour's freezer.</p>\n\n<p>I typed into Google 'thou shall not steal' after realizing that I committed a sin (one day after Yom Kippur... sigh). The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia entry</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Steal\" in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by\n  Jewish commentaries to refer to the stealing of an actual human being,\n  that is, to kidnapping, including human trafficking. With this\n  understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish\n  tradition would more accurately be rendered as \"Thou shalt not\n  kidnap\". Kidnapping would then constitute a capital offence and thus\n  merit its inclusion among the Ten Commandments.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, this commandment has come to be interpreted, especially\n  in non-Jewish traditions, as the unauthorized taking of private\n  property (stealing or theft), which is a wrongful action already\n  prohibited elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible that does not ordinarily\n  incur the death penalty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before reading the first paragraph I totally held the second paragraph to be the only truth when it comes to this commandment — and atonement for this sin by repaying the stolen object (\"eye for eye, tooth for tooth\"). The first paragraph puts it in a different light.</p>\n\n<p>Please elaborate on the idea that stealing in that context might actually mean stealing a human being / human trafficking.</p>\n\n<p>(Is the original Hebrew different and it was mistranslated into English, or did Chazal interpret it this way?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>\"Don't steal\" includes don't steal someone's soda. </p>\n\n<p>The \"don't steal\" commandment appears in both Exodus and Leviticus. Leviticus refers to property, as the next phrase is -- <em>and don't lie or deny about it.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Yes, the Talmud says the verse in Exodus refers to kidnapping. But regardless of which verse it is, don't steal! (The punishment is to pay back double, by the way; that way, the thief loses as much as s/he intended to inflict on the other person.)</p>\n\n<p>The reason the Talmud had to identify one verse about kidnapping is an interesting pattern in the Torah -- anytime we find <em>if one does X, they are liable to the death penalty</em>, there has to be some other verse that says <em>thou shalt not do X</em>. Take a look at Leviticus Ch. 18, for example; there's a series of <em>thou shalt not</em> vis-a-vis relationships; then a few chapters later the penalties are listed. So Exodus a few chapters later will say <em>if someone kidnaps the penalty is death</em>, which means there must have first been a thou-shalt-not? The Talmud therefore says it was the \"don't steal\" in the Ten Commandments.</p>\n\n<p>This is all at a very nitty-gritty level. The Ten Commandments are broad and encompass many types of sins; thus, <em>don't steal</em> encompasses everything from the harshest possible, kidnapping, to something much smaller. </p>\n\n\n",

From <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.10a.13?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 10a-b</a>, I understand 1) that all of these cases are obligated from the Torah (אלא מעשר מי איכא למימר מדרבנן), and 2) that whether a structure qualifies for this list depends on if it's a \"house\" (this is implied in the Gemara's explanation for the opinion that it has to serve as a house for both summer and winter).</p>\n\n<p>It seems that in all of the cases in this Mishna of houses obligating ma'aser, there is also an obligation to put up a mezuza according to the respective opinions (Rabbi Yehuda in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.10a.16?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 10a</a>, unnamed tanna/Rabbi Me'ir in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sukkah.8b.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukka 8b</a> and Rabbi Yosi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tractate_Mezuzah.1.8?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mezuza 1:8</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Given that the definitions for a house seem to be the same between ma'aser and mezuza, does this still hold for courtyards? <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.3.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'asrot 3:5</a> defines what counts as a courtyard with regard to ma'aser, and gates of courtyards are also obligated in mezuza (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.11a.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 11a</a>), but I haven't found the same definitions as those of a courtyard for ma'asrot brought in connection with the laws of mezuza. (If the definitions are different, it would be more understandable according to the opinion that a courtyard doesn't make food obligated in ma'aser from the Torah, but there should still be some logic to having two different definitions.)</p>\n\n<p>So is a courtyard that obligates ma'aser the same kind of courtyard that is obligated in mezuza?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How Many vav Hahipuchs in each of the 24 books of Tenach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How Many vav Hahipuchs (Conversive vav) are in each of the 24 books of Tenach compared with the number of letters / verses in that book.  As far as I know they are only in Tenach rather than Mishna or any subsequent work.\nIt would be interesting to see if the number of conversive vavs declines as prophecy declined in the 2nd Temple period.\nI'd like to compare the ratio of conversive vavs in each book with the number of letters and verses in that book.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't have a count, but I can give some rules about its appearance, and from that we can make an estimation.</p>\n\n<p>In narrative portions, the vast majority of verbs introduced with a vav (which is most verbs) use the vav hahipuch. (This includes the beginning of verses, chapters, books, even the first word of the Prophets at the beginning of Yehoshua.) Also in commandments the vav hahipuch is used with the same frequency.</p>\n\n<p>Spoken statements tend to have more verbs without the vav hahipuch, even when those verbs are introduced with a vav. (But it is used in quotations as well, for example Bereshis 3:10.)</p>\n\n<p>The books of Tehilim, Mishlei, Iyov (other than the narritive at the beginning and end, and the introductions to the speeches) Shir Hashirim, Koheles and Eicha rarely use the vav hahipuch. (However, those books also don't have many verbs with a vav introducing them at all. There are instances of vav hahipuch in each of them, but you have to search for it.)</p>\n\n<p>The vav hahipuch is used in the books of Ezra and Daniel as much as in other books. It is not used in biblical Aramaic.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, let us estimate how frequently the vav hahiputo is used in each book:</p>\n\n<p>1-9) In Chumash and Neviim Reshonim, the average usage is for sure more than once per verse.</p>\n\n<p>10-13) In Neviim Achronim there are more prophetic passages, and fewer verbs introduced with a vav. Let us guess that this averages out to one for every two or three verses.</p>\n\n<p>14-16) The poetic books of Tehilim, Mishlei, and Iyov have very few vav hahipuchs in total.</p>\n\n<p>17-21) Of the five megilos, two of them, Ruth and Ester, have more than one per verse, and the other three have very few.</p>\n\n<p>22-24) Ezra/Nechemia, Daniel and Divrei Hayomim all have fewer vav hahipuchs, the first two because of the Aramaic portions, and Divrei Hayomim (like Ezra) because of long genealogical passages. Let's put the average at one for three verses.</p>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, most of the books with very few vav hahipuchs are from the early First Temple period (or earlier, depending on when Iyov was written,) and Eicha is from the Exile period. The more prophetic books use the vav hahipuch less than the less prophetic books, on the whole. And the books from the Second Temple period use the vav hahipuch almost as much as the earlier books.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Breakdown of וי\"ו ההיפוך per sefer in Tanach</strong></p>\n<p>Since <em>vav hahipuch</em> is really a grammatical feature and a word-based determination not depending on number of letters in words, I think you will be best served with ratios of per-pasuk frequency and per-word frequency - you can still get a gist of per-letter ratios by sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are the results:</strong> <em>(see explanations below)</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XshRHNcg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XshRHNcg.jpg\" alt=\"Table of vav hahipuch occurrences in Tanach\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Caveats</strong></p>\n<p>Please take the exactness of the numbers here with a few grains of salt as this is very subject to error due to issues of discrepancies related to <em>kri/ksiv</em>, <em>taam tachton/elyon</em> and potential calculation errors.

    "content": "# When to take legal action versus \"turning the other cheek\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is my understanding that \"turning the other cheek\" is a uniquely Christian concept that is alien to Judaism. It appears that we are encouraged to take (legal) action against those who do us harm and not to simply let it go. See Chabad article here: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1791975/jewish/Is-Turning-the-Other-Cheek-a-Jewish-Value.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1791975/jewish/Is-Turning-the-Other-Cheek-a-Jewish-Value.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>This article states that it is not the Jewish way to turn away from a violent aggressor. The concept of \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" is also prominent in Jewish scripture (albeit not interpreted literally but in the context of legal damages.)</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm not clear if this applies all across the board or to just specific scenarios (e.g. scenarios that involve violence.) More specifically, I'd like to know what halakha prescribes for harassment from noisy neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that you have some awful neighbors who harass you night and day for 2 years straight by making extreme amounts of noise. Mind you, I'm not talking about people who are simply loud in their day-to-day activities, but someone who is actually maliciously and intentionally creating noise with the explicit intent of harassing you and depriving you of sleep and peace.</p>\n\n<p>If one were to consult with most lawyers or police officers (as I have), they would probably tell you that your best bet is to simply move away and not bother with legal proceedings. However, I am confused as to where halakha stands on this.</p>\n\n<p>Is it OK to just move away without taking legal action against the bad neighbor? Would this be considered \"turning the other cheek\" and therefore against Jewish law?</p>\n\n<p>If there are any Orthodox Rabbanim here in particular, I'd like to know what you suggest would be the best course of action.</p>\n\n<p>According to Halakha, should you take such neighbors to court or is it ok to just cut your losses and move away without taking any sort of action against them for the damage they've done to you?</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am interested only in the Orthodox interpretation</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Judaism isn't a religion created knee jerk against Christianity. It's a weird premise to begin with (Judaism came first).</p>\n<p>The concept that if someone comes to fight you you should go out and strike first is especially pertinent to warfare or protecting your physical life. Then you don't take a passive approach.</p>\n<p>Incidentally regarding the concept of the other cheek, from a Jewish perspective the left side is Gevurah anyway. So if they strike you on your right cheek, don't respond with Chesed. Give them Gevurah. Show them \"I too can be Esav.\" \"The hands are the hands of Esav but the voice is the voice of Ya'akov.\"</p>\n<p>There are issues in halacha with litigating in secular courts against Jews. Any litigation should first involve a Beis Din. They can give permission to go to a secular court if necessary. A Jew may take a non Jew to secular court for litigation. See Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 26.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Similar: I once heard an explanation of what it means to \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/129766/how-come-rav-nachman-isn-t-happy-with-someone-going-beyond-the-letter-of-the-law/132394#132394\">go beyond the letter of the law</a>\", which is the practice of the \"pious\". It doesn't mean adding laws, or adopting stringencies, as many think, but it means as follows: yes, the law says you can take someone to Beit Din, <em>but you don't have to</em>. You could forgive them, and let it go, and this is an act of piety.</p>\n<p>How this would apply to the circumstance in the OP should of course be discussed with a Rabbi who knows the situation, however I don't think expecting someone to put up with an on-going situation of abuse falls under this, and Jewish law would probably consider \"turning the other cheek\" not an act of piety here, but an act of stupidity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek#Nonviolent_resistance_interpretation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek#Nonviolent_resistance_interpretation</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The scholar Walter Wink, in his book Engaging the Powers: Discernment\nand Resistance in a World of Domination, interprets the passage as\nways to subvert the power structures of the time.</p>\n<p>At the time of Jesus, says Wink, striking backhand a person deemed to\nbe of lower socioeconomic class was a means of asserting authority and\ndominance. If the persecuted person \"turned the other cheek,\" the\ndiscipliner was faced with a dilemma: The left hand was used for\nunclean purposes, so a back-hand strike on the opposite cheek would\nnot be performed. An alternative would be a slap with the open hand as\na challenge or to punch the person, but this was seen as a statement\nof equality. Thus, by turning the other cheek, the persecuted was\ndemanding equality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Sorry this does not fit the format of most answer on this site, but is is a bit long for a comment)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What IKEA furniture or tools is permitted to be assembled on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>IKEA offers lots of furniture and utensils for self-assembly, some of which are pretty sophisticated, requiring screws and fasteners and some are pretty easy to assemble without tools or connecting parts.</p>\n\n<p>I take IKEA as they are known for modularity, especially for efficiency in storage. While big furniture is clearly out of question, small or simple items like utensils are tricky, maybe a snap-on handle for a plastic glass or, say, two-piece fork.</p>\n\n<p>In general, what types of those tools/furniture can be constructed on Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R Jack Abramowitz clarifies (<a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/the-39-melachos/melacha34/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) the distinction between the permitted and forbiddden part of the <em>melacha</em> of <em>boneh</em> (assembling or building)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While the av melacha (primary labor) involves both assembling separate\n  pieces into a unified whole and forming a shelter, either activity is\n  prohibited on Shabbos, even if the other is not accomplished.\n  Accordingly, one may not pitch a tent or throw schach on the roof of a\n  Succah (forming a shelter in the absence of assembling pieces).\n  <strong>Likewise, one may not put together pre-fabricated furniture (such as one might get at Ikea), even though doing so does not create a\n  shelter. Even screwing the handle into a broom is assembling and\n  therefore boneh!</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Home repairs are included under the melacha of boneh, as one is not\n  permitted to add to an existing structure on Shabbos. Driving a nail\n  into a wall for a picture hook or laying tile are adding to the\n  building and therefore boneh. It is not boneh, however, when an action\n  reflects an object’s normal mode of use. Therefore, if a sliding door\n  comes off its track, it may be replaced. Similarly, one might replace\n  the spring-operated dispenser that holds a roll of bathroom tissue.\n  [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>While one may not assemble furniture or other utensils on Shabbos, one\n  may open and close folding objects such as tables, chairs, portacribs\n  and strollers.

But this interpretation isn't quite so simple, because not all the people that Bnei Yisrael met during their travels are mentioned here - the Moabites and Midianites are nowhere to be found. Instead, we have here Ma'on and the Tzidonim, entirely different people. Therefore, it is suggested in <a href=\"https://www.knowingfaith.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%94%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A2%D7%9F-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this essay</a> that the Egyptians here are actually a group that oppressed Am Yisrael post-conquest (sometime in the era of the Shoftim; consider that the text zooms in on particular events and largely skips over most of the timespan of the book).</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.1.27-33?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 1:27-33</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Neither did Menasheh drive out the inhabitants of Bet-she᾽an and its hamlets, nor Ta῾nakh and its hamlets, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its hamlets, nor the inhabitants of Yivle῾am and its hamlets, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its hamlets: but the Kena῾ani persisted in dwelling in that land...Neither did Efraim drive out the Kena῾ani that dwelt in Gezer; but the Kena῾ani dwelt in Gezer among them. Neither did Zevulun drive out the inhabitants of Qitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Kena῾ani dwelt among them, and became tributaries. Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of ῾Akko, nor the inhabitants of Żidon, nor of Aĥlav, nor of Akhziv, nor of Ḥelba, nor of Afiq, nor of Reĥov...Neither did Naftali drive out the inhabitants of Bet-Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bet-῾Anat; but he dwelt among the Kena῾ani, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bet-Shemesh and of Bet-῾Anat became tributaries to them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I heard Rabbi Ouri Cherki point this out in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMiEOHrvtZ4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">class</a> once. It is known from Egyptian documents that the Egyptians only truly cared about controlling specific parts of Canaan: The coastal plain, the valleys (particularly Emek Yizrael) and the northern-most part of the land - this allowed them to form a comfortable path from Egypt all the way to Damascus (where they constantly waged war with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitanni</a> (see, for example, the descriptions of Thutmose III's and Amenhotep II's Canaanite conquests). The territories that Menashe didn't manage to free are exactly the areas that were key to the Egyptians. Megiddo, in particular, was one of the most important cities in Canaan to the Egyptians (during Thutmose III's time, for example, the Egyptians spent 7 months sieging the city).</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Names of towns:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are some names of towns/locations that may be connected to the Egyptians:</p>\n<p>a. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.15.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maayan Mei Naftoach</a> - Possibly connected to Mernephtach or to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.10.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naftuchim</a> (one of the original Egyptian clans).</p>\n<p>b. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.17.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hamichmetet</a> - possible stemming from the Egyptian name for Egypt: Kemet. Note that Hamichmetet is described as overlooking Shechem, whose king, according to the El-Amarna letters, was the leader of that era's rebellion against the Egyptians, referred to as the \"Apiru\" - in other words, an Egyptian outpost overlooking such a troublesome city would make sense.</p>\n<p>Both were conquered by Yehoshua, but nonetheless may point to Egyptians having been present in those places. Presumably they then retreated to the places not conquered.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that from what archeologists can tell, the Egyptians considered Canaan to be 100% part of Egypt. They called it \"Retenu\". It is difficult to tell whether the Canaanites saw themselves as Egyptians for we do not have that many Canaanite texts. However, it certainly seems they did not, considering the many times the Canaanites rebelled against the Egyptians (some consider the Apiru to have been some kind of ancient social-change liberty movement) and from the fact that their cultures were so different. In fact, just to communicate with the Canaanites, the Egyptians had to resort to the Middle-Eastern lingua franca and writing style of the time, Akkadian-cuneiform, as opposed to their own Egyptian-hieroglyphics. The Tanach appears to sort-of side with the Canaanites on this point - the land is separate from Egypt (for if we were to say that the land is part of Egypt, then that means that Hashem chalilah never took Am Yisrael out of Egypt). It's possible that for this reason, the Egyptian presence in Canaan is greatly minimized.</p>\n\n\n",

Towards the end of his introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah, Rambam writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וההלכות שעשה הרב הגדול רבינו יצחק זצ\"ל הספיקו במקום כולם לפי שהם כוללים כל תועליות הפסקים והמשפטים הנצרכים בזמננו זה כלומר זמן הגלות וכבר בירר בהם כל השגיאות שנפלו בפסקי קודמיו <strong>ולא הוקשו לנו בהם אלא הלכות מעטות לא יגיעו לעשר בשום פנים</strong></p>\n<p>And the [book of] Halachot that the great rabbi R. Isaac of blessed memory produced is sufficient against all of them, for they contain all the benefits of the rulings and laws that are needed in our times – meaning the time of exile. And he already clarified all the mistakes that accrued in the rulings of his predecessors, <strong>and we have difficulty with them only on a few laws – not even reaching ten in any form</strong>.</p>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we assume that having difficulty with a ruling is equivalent to disagreeing with it then at the time of the writing of the Commentary to the Mishnah he thought that he disagreed with the Rif fewer than ten times.</p>\n<p>However, in a responsum to R. Nehorai ben Hillel the judge, Rambam wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמנם מה שזכרתם על רבנו יצחק ז\"ל בזה המקום הוא זולת מה שאמרנו בלי ספק והיא דבר בלתי צודק אמנם לא ידעתי אם אמר זה ר' יצחק ז\"ל או לא <strong>וזה שאנחנו חלקנו עליו בקצת מקומות כמו ל' מקום או יותר</strong> מה שתפס עליו תלמידו רבנו יוסף הלוי ז\"ל בשבועות ובבתרא וקצתם הערנו עליהם</p>\n<p>However, that which you mention about R. Isaac of blessed memory in this case is without a doubt not what we have said, and it is something incorrect. However, I don't know if R. Isaac of blessed memory said this or not. <strong>And this that we disagree with him in several places – about 30 or more places –</strong> that which his student R. Issac the Levite of blessed memory grasped against him in Shavuot and [Bava] Batra, and some of them we have commented on.</p>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here he seems to think that he actually disagreed with the Rif around 30 times. This could either mean that the statement in the Commentary wasn't referring precisely to disagreements, or that in the years since writing the Commentary he revised his opinion or had more disagreements. (The latter is the suggestion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Sheilat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Sheilat</a> in his footnote to the responsum.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If you're not overweight, can you still use a food scale and an app to count calories during Chol Ha'moed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>During Chol Ha'moed, more food may be available than usual. The research literature <a href=\"https://katherinetallmadge.com/2010/12/07/too-many-choices-how-variety-leads-to-obesity/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">suggests</a> that, when there's a lot of food variety available in our homes, we're more likely to overeat. Still, food logging may slightly lessen the likelihood of this overeating.</p>\n<h1>My question</h1>\n<p>Imagine that you're neither overweight nor underweight, but at an average weight. Still, you'd like to lose another ten pounds or so.</p>\n<p>Electronically counting calories requires multiple steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2017/10/10/weight-and-measuring-on-chol-hamoed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Weighing</a> all the food you eat for a meal. (E.g. 150 grams of \"challah\" bread, 200 grams of \"chulent\" stew, and 500 grams of vegetable salad.) I use a digital food scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Entering this food (bread, stew, and salad) into a free calorie-counting app. I like the Nutritionix app, which has a more-accurate food database than many other apps. Some people prefer MyFitnessPal or one of the numerous other options out there.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you've done these steps, the app will calculate the total calories for the meal and add them to your daily total.</p>\n<p>Is it permissible to do the above steps during Ḥol Ha'moed?</p>\n<p>When you answer, please explain your reasoning. Thanks in advance!</p>\n<h1>Postscript</h1>\n<p>Calories <a href=\"http://clarerooney.com/calories-count-but-theyre-not-the-whole-story/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">count</a>, but they're <a href=\"https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/calories\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not the whole story</a>.</p>\n<p>Caloric restriction isn't especially pleasant.

Artscroll translate the first two as past tense and the last as future tense, but I don't trust their translation since they change the subject in a way that does not appear to be p'shat.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Let's divide the verse into two parts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נשאו נהרות ה'—נשאו נהרות קולם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישאו נהרות דכים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Each part is one sentence. </p>\n\n<p>The first one is broken up poetically by a caesura, around which both the subject and verb are repeated. So the reason \"נשאו\" and \"נהרות\" are identical in each of their appearances is simply that they are repetitions of <em>the same word</em>.<sup>1</sup> And the invocation of God's name is an apostrophe, so let's move that to the end to simplify things. Then we are left, more or less, with</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Floods have raised their voices, God</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an <em>observation</em> of an event or series of events that has happened, so the verb is perfective. Without getting bogged down in the spectrum of tenses, it is pretty expectable for it to be translated in a past continuous or present continuous tense for that reason.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The floods lift up their fall<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a prediction or a promise, so the verb is imperfective and it is rendered in a future or present tense in translation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://torah.org/series/ravhirsch/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Hirsch</a> explains in his commentary (p. 162) that the noisy rushing waters stand for powerful nations who have continually raised their voices against God (past), but, as is the case with mighty waterfalls, \"the 'lifting up' of the nations' voices is only a prelude to their decline\" (future).</p>\n\n<p>You may notice that I listed some form of present tense for both verbs above. This might be confusing in a vacuum, so hopefully the meaningful difference between observation and prediction clarify the difference in the original. English's present tense can include both perfectives and imperfectives, which may be the sticking point in the imbalance of translations.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Kind of like, though not exactly, the word \"tapping\" in \"And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door\" (<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Poe</a>). Semantically it is only there once, i.e. it could be read \"you came tapping at my chamber door\" without changing the <em>meaning</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>This is the translation of Rav Hirsch.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I can only answer you first question.

Falk looked like. So if a rabbi looks like R. Falk, he should be okay.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If I have understood your question correctly, you are asking how it is possible for a Rebbi to be on the level of an angel? Or more precisely, how can they resemble what is essentially a celestially-rooted being when humans are inherently ‘earthly’ in form?</p>\n<p>Rav Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz zt\"l noted that the answer is that just as a מלאך has no personal aspirations but rather is driven purely to satisfy the will of Hashem, so too a Rebbi must be focused entirely on fuelling the success of his students.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, a Rebbi must be consistent with his appointed title. This means that he must not be deficient in the traits necessary for a מחנך. If a teacher is lacking in his level of observance, character or learning it will serve to hamper his personal example. Failure to be a true role model will abjectly impact on his students. The fact that we liken our Rebbeim to angels is a testament to the high regard with which we view them. They serve to mould and fashion our children into 'עובדי ה, and for this alone, we must endeavour to ensure that our children receive the correct level of teaching. Indeed, Rabbi Moshe Shternbach שליט\"א notes that one must be quick to ascertain that their children have a רבי who is a ירא שמים and this means seeing him with your own eyes to verify if he will provide a good example.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>Likewise, Rabbi Yaakov Neiman זצ\"ל in his דרכי מוסר also explains how important it is for a teacher to be a ירא שמים. When an educator has this מדה his influence is all the more impacting on his תלמידים. For example, when a teacher relates the miraculous experiences of יציאת מצרים, and his absolute 'אמונת ה is evident, it enters into the heart of his students and leaves a lasting impression. This is the whole understanding behind a Rebbi resembling a malach as he notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכן אמרו חז\"ל אם הרב דומה למלאך ד' תורה בקשו מפיו ואם לא אל יבקשו תורה מפיו כי הכל תלוי ברב שמלמד תורה לכן מצאנו בחז\"ל שאמר רב לברי' כשתשב ללמוד תורה מרבך ראה בפניו שנאמר והי' עיניך רואות את מוריך כי ראיית פני הרב מביאה יראת שמים</p>\n<p>Therefore Chazal says if a Rav resembles an angel of Hashem, seek Torah from his mouth and if not do not seek Torah from his mouth because it all depends on the Rav who teaches Torah. Therefore we find in Chazal that Rav said to his son when you sit to learn Torah from your Rebbi make sure to see his face. As it says \"And your eyes shall see your teacher\" because seeing the face of one's Rav leads one to become fearful of heaven.<sup>3</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conversely, when a teacher says something that lacks conviction, his students will see this lackadaisical approach and will not absorb the message. For this reason, R’ Neiman writes elsewhere that it is crucial that a Rebbi teaches with a mindset that is completely לשמה.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>It is only when an act is performed לשמה that Hashem can allow His שכינה to settle. This is because when a person is of pure heart and mind; his resulting actions truly reflect his intentions. This purity consequently provides a foothold for the Divine presence to cling to. This means that teachers have a tremendous responsibility as when they avoid acting in a לשמה manner their students may not learn properly. This in turn, can result in disinterested students which can ח\"ו leave them open to foreign and evil influence. Thus the aim is for them to strive to be 'angelic' by providing  a solid example and maintaining a strong 'יראת ה which filters down to their students.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As brought down by HaRav Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz זצ\"ל in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49723&st=&pgnum=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קונטרוס יסודות החינוך מרבותינו גדולי ישראל שליט\"א: דברים שנאמרו בכינוס מאות מחנכים ומנהלים רוחניים, כסלו תשע\"א, 'הרב הדומה למלאך שכל כוונתו תועלת התלמיד', עמוד 5</a> - He writes there;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דכמו שמלאך אין לו שום כוונה לתועלת עצמו וכל התכלית שלו זה רק לקיים רצון השי\"ת, כך גם הרב המלמד את תורת ד' צריך שיהיה כל כוונתו לתועלת הצלחת התלמיד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Refer to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19984&st=&pgnum=123\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ספר אורחות הבית, חלק ראשון, פרק ששה עשר, אות ז', עמוד קכב</a>.

The latter part of the reading (23:1 and on) is easier to understand as it deals directly with the festivals.

And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day. And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted. On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the LORD. And ye shall keep My commandments, and do them: I am the LORD. And ye shall not profane My holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD who hallow you, that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the relevance to Sukkot? Do the Rishonim offer any explanations as to the relevance of this to Sukkot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin in his work Ha'amek Davar (Leviticus 22,26) writes the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This section is next to the holiday section and is read on the\n  holidays. There is no doubt that there is an oral tradition dating\n  back to Moses our Master that on the holidays the Torah reading begins\n  with \"When a bullock, or a sheep...\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then goes on to explain the relevance of each verse to the holidays of Sukkot ans Passover.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another explanation is found in the Torat Ha'mincha by the 14th century scholar Rabbi Yaakov Scilli (pupil of the Rashba):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And where we're we told that that sin (the golden calf - JH) was\n  entirely forgiven and his affection has returned to us like it was in\n  the past? In the section of the holidays. Therefore the section\n  dealing with the holidays sacrifices begins with none other that the\n  bullock, to say that it will no longer serve as remembrance to the\n  sin, as no sin is found in Israel. - Very loosly translated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then quotes a Pesikta (chapter 9) that brings the same explanation. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Tur (417) writes in the name of his brother Rabbi Yehuda that the holidays where given to us in merit of our forefathers Abraham, Issac and Jacob. </p>\n\n<p>The Medrash (Yalkut Shimoni on Leviticus 22,26) says that the bullock is in merit of Abraham, the sheep is in merit of Issac and the goat is in merit Jacob.</p>\n\n<p>Connecting the two together, we can understand why the holiday Torah portion begins with \"When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat...\". Both the bullock and Passover were given to us in the merit of Abraham, both Shavuot and the sheep were given to us in the merit of Issac and both the goat and Sukkot were given to us in the merit of Jacob.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Similar to the previous explanation, according to Yonatan Ben Uziel the bullock, sheep and goat allude to Abraham, Issac and Jacob, who's merit we are trying to awaken now that we can no longer bring the sacrifices.</h2>\n\n<p>The Ra'avyah (vol II megilla 596) addresses the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The holiday section begins with \"When a bullock, or a sheep, or a\n  goat...\", because the section ends with \"that brought you out of the\n  land of Egypt\", which is apropos to Passover (and the other holidays\n  as well - JH). and the laws of sacrifices, since many sacrifices are\n  needed on the holidays. It is all one topic and they belong to each\n  other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>My ignorance prevents me from providing sources as you've requested, but I'll dare to offer an explanation of my own.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Megilla 4a) traces the origins of holiday torah reading all the way back to Moses. Later on (30b) the Mishna states that on the first day of Succot the portion regarding sacrifices in Leviticus is read. it would seem that back in the times of the Mishna they did not begin from the same point as we do today.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to suggest that reading from the beginning as we do today was instituted at a later period. Perhaps in place of dealing with the sacrifices which we no longer have, we read the relevant laws ונשלמה פרים שפתותינו.</p>\n\n\n",

If I'm not under a very strict and constant routine which exhausts me both physically and mentally, I have trouble having a normal 'before 12 a.m. sleep, before 10 a.m. wake' sleeping cycle.

To summarise his point which is central to his analysis in each chapter: Jewish thought believes strongly that our neurosis (non-biological mental problems) are deeply rooted in habits. </p>\n\n<h2>Are we free to change our predisposition?</h2>\n\n<p>First, he establishes that Jewish philosophy emphasises the existence of as I would paraphrase it a ‘bounded free will’. Even though “all human affairs are in the hands of the Creator”, he continues “Man should certainly strive to improve his human condition in any way he can”. But: “whether he is successful or not in doing so is not within his control, but G’ds.”</p>\n\n<p>He reconciles the dilemma ‘are we in control or not’ by citing from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.156b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TB Shabbath 156B</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And from that which transpired to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak as well, it can be derived that there is no constellation for the Jewish people, As Chaldean astrologers told Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s mother: Your son will be a thief. She did not allow him to uncover his head. She said to her son: Cover your head so that the fear of Heaven will be upon you, and pray for Divine mercy. He did not know why she said this to him. One day he was sitting and studying beneath a palm tree that did not belong to him, and the cloak fell off of his head. He lifted his eyes and saw the palm tree. He was overcome by impulse and he climbed up and detached a bunch of dates with his teeth. Apparently, he had an inborn inclination to steal but was able to overcome that inclination with proper education and prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the commentary within the translation indicates, so also does Rabbi Amsel conclude:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Insoluble as this may seem at first glance […] if we equate “fate” in this instance with a predisposition to steal […] it is the actuation of this predisposition which Rabbi Nachman’s mother feared, and against which she sought protective measures.”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Three parts to our inclination</h2>\n\n<p>The book builds on this theme, which is summarised in three major determinants of behaviour which are, according to Rabbi Amsel, central to Jewish thought about habit formation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A predisposition towards certain character traits</li>\n<li>The two inclinations (the evil and good inclination), which represent the choice between two distinct paths in life, and</li>\n<li>One’s environment – his family, friends, neighbours, peers and countrymen – all of whom may influence him in the direction of good or evil.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To keep my answer to-the-point I will try to resist summarising the entire book. The above is how Rabbi Amsel contrasts psycho-analytic theory (more commonly known as Freudian psychology) with Jewish thought. Psychoanalysis is a theory that at its core is a ‘drive’ or ‘instinct’ theory. People have urges (for procreation, the Eros, and for survival, the Thanatos) and these form our hidden motives, hidden from ourselves firstly and mostly. These urges are neutral; psychoanalytic thought does away with any moral judgement on the manifestation of any of these urges. Jewish thought, in contrast, agrees that we have urges, but does not only distinguish between good and ‘bad’ (evil) urges but also considers that we (can) know in which moral domain our urges lie. We are not slaves to our urges, but possess a unique power to rise above them, and one of our tools is engineering our environment.</p>\n\n<h2>Realising most things are habits, and habits can be changed</h2>\n\n<p>The power of habit formation, either good or bad is demonstrated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.38b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TB Yoma 38B</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once most of a person’s years have passed and he did not sin, he will never sin, as it is stated: “He will keep the feet of His pious ones” (I Samuel 2:9). Once a person has established himself as righteous, God will keep him from failing thereafter. In the school of Rabbi Sheila they say: Once the opportunity to perform a sinful act presents itself to a person a first time and a second, and he does not sin, he will never sin, as it is stated: “He will keep the feet of His pious ones” (I Samuel 2:9). Once he has refrained from sin several times, he has established himself as pious and God will protect him thereafter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.86b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TB Yoma 86B</a> underscores how we have the power to stop bad habits (or, as the example illustrates, how bad habits start or are maintained):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was taught in a baraita that Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: When a person commits a transgression the first time, he is forgiven; a second time, he is forgiven; a third time, he is forgiven; but the fourth time, he is not forgiven, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: For three transgressions of Israel, but for four I will not reverse it” (Amos 2:6). And it says: “All these things does God do twice or three times with a man” (Job 33:29). </p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara asks: What is: And it says? Why did he need to bring an additional biblical proof when the first verse seems to suffice? The Gemara explains: Lest you say that this statement that the Holy One, Blessed be He, forgives easily the first three times applies to a community but not to an individual, come and hear proof from another verse that states: “All these things does God do twice or three times with a man,” implying that this so even for an individual. From this point onward, he is not forgiven, as it is stated: “For three transgressions of Israel, but for four I will not reverse it.”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to form the basis of Rabbi Amsel’s analysis of Jewish thought on habit formation. I believe his following Talmud-paraphrase (which I can’t trace to a source) is his own paraphrase of the two above paragraphs in Yoma 86B:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Huna stated: as soon as a man transgresses a certain transgression and he repeats it, it becomes permissible to him [The Talmud asks] How could you think that he thinks it becomes permissible [when he really knows it is forbidden]? Only say he makes believe; he deludes himself into believing it is permissible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So these passages form the crux of Jewish thought on habit formation: not only does a habit become second nature, <strong>but the habit also changes our views as to the permissibility of the act</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>How to change bad habits?</h2>\n\n<p>The rest of the book basically builds on this core concept by first providing ample additional sources, such as Maimonides, Luzzato, Cheshbon Hanefesh, etc., to support his thesis that Jewish thought believes that bad habits are not the results of unconscious thought foremost, but rather the result of engaging in bad habits in the first place. Do it twice, and you have basically decided that it is okay to do the thing you state you don’t want to do. The Jewish philosophy is that the habit starts of as self-deception, and becomes part of your nature, your predisposition.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Amsel translates Maimonides potential cure to change bad habits as such (I don’t know the source; it is probably the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters%2C_Introduction?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to The Eight Chapters</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And how may their cure be? He who is of a hot temperament should be taught to demean himself this wise: If he be smitten and cursed, he must not feel the insult at all and follow this way a long time until anger will be completely rooted out from his heart. And he who was arrogant should accustom himself to a life of extreme self-abasement . . . And this line he should follow in al the rest of his tendencies; if he had distanced himself to the extreme point of one, he should remove himself to the extreme end of the other and follow it up a long time until he may return to the good way, which is the middle-standard in each and every tendency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Conclusion: how to translate all the above to the question at hand</h2>\n\n<p>So, tachles, to translate all this to your specific question: sleeping on time:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>While not being able to fall asleep might be biological; browsing the internet late at night is not; that is a habit.</li>\n<li>There is no magic potion so to speak; train yourself (and your body) to adhere to a strict circadian rhythm: build a healthy habit, fight the yetzer hara (evil inclination) and it will become second nature eventually.  </li>\n<li>Be very strict with your sleeping schedule. Do not allow yourself any leniencies: one time allowing yourself an excuse to sleep late is a gateway to repeating it. After the second time, you will have basically made sleeping late permissible to yourself. The very act of ‘cheating’ on your sleeping schedule reshapes your judgment about it.</li>\n<li>Train yourself by starting off more extreme than necessary. Do you stay awake until 03:00, whereas you need to sleep no later than 23:00? Set your new sleeping time at 21:00. Stop any new activity at 20:00 or 20:30 and start going to bed (brushing teeth, etc.) so that you go to bed at 21:00. Once you become habituated to this it is easier to relax the schedule to 22:00, which allows room for unforeseen problems going to sleep without crossing the 23:00 boundary.</li>\n<li>Set up your environment to prepare yourself for success. Turn phones on to flight mode (no internet, etc.), tell your friends/family that you can only be contact in case of emergency. Any shows you want to watch on TV or a streaming service of choice? Record it or save it to a ‘watch later’ list, and watch it when it does not interfere with your new sleeping schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

How could Rabbi Meir\n  receive Torah from the mouth of Acheir\n  [the former Elisha ben Avuya, after\n  he became a heretic]? Doesn’t Rabbah\n  bar bar Chana quote Rabbi Yochanan\n  [in Chagigah as saying], “What does it\n  mean when it says, ‘For the Kohen’s lips\n  should keep knowledge; they should see\n  Torah from his lips, for he is the angel\n  of Hashem, L-rd of Hosts” (Malachi\n  2:7)? If the rav is similar to an angel\n  of Hashem, L-rd of Hosts, seek Torah\n  from his mouth. And if not, do not seek\n  Torah from his mouth.” And the Talmud\n  concludes, “There is no question—this\n  [Rabbi Meir studying under Acheir] is in\n  regard to someone great, this [the verse]\n  is of someone of smaller stature.”</p>\n  \n  <p>It is worth understanding according to\n  this how Rabbi Yochanan spoke without\n  elaboration, since he speaks only of the\n  smaller statured, not the greats. One\n  may say that we should be exacting in\n  that which Rabbi Yochanan said, “Seek\n  Torah from his mouth” and not “Learn\n  from him.” For in truth, one who learns\n  from his peer does not learn from the\n  mouth of the person who is teaching\n  him, but listens and weighs on the scales\n  of his mind, and then he understands the\n  concept. This is not learning “from the\n  mouth of” his teacher, but from the mind\n  of the teacher. “Torah from the mouth”\n  is only considered accepting the concepts\n  as he heard them, with no criticism. And\n  it was by this idea that Rabbi Yochanan\n  spoke about accepting Torah from the\n  mouth [i.e., uncritically] only if the rabbi\n  is similar to an angel of Hashem, L-rd of\n  Hosts.</p>\n  \n  <p>And according to this, hinted to in\n  Rabbi Yochanan’s words is a distinction\n  between one who is of smaller stature\n  and one who is great. The person of\n  smaller stature will learn Torah from the\n  mouth, for he is unable to decide what\n  to draw near and what to keep away.\n  Whereas a person of great stature who\n  has the ability to decide [critically] does\n  not learn Torah “from [someone else’s]\n  mouth.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, it’s appropriate to alert\n  anyone who contemplates the books of\n  Acharonim that they should not “learn\n  Torah from their mouths,” they shouldn’t\n  treat everything implied by what was said\n  as a fundamental principle before they\n  explore well their words.</p>\n  \n  <p>Something like a hint of this idea can\n  be learned from what the Gemara says\n  in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.85b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia, Chapter “HaSocheir es\n  haPo’alim” [85b]</a>: Rabbi Chiya said, “I made it\n  so that the Torah would not be forgotten\n  from Israel.” It explains there that he\n  would plant flax, spread out nets [made\n  of that flax, thereby] hunt deer, made\n  parchment [of their hides], and write\n  [on them] Chumash texts. This hints\n  that whatever is in our power to prepare\n  from the beginning of the Torah, it\n  is incumbent on us to do ourselves,\n  according to the ability that was inherited\n  to us to explore and understand. And not\n  to rely [passively] on the words of the\n  Gedolim who preceded us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not saying I personally would advocate shutting off critical thought when learning Torah. And I don't think that's Rav Shimon's intent either.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, one should look for a rebbe who is so overwhelmingly ahead of you -- \"like an angel\" --  that trying to second-guess him seems silly. You might ask and challenge, but you have all expectation that your questions will be answered.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the Talmud (Moed Katan 17a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was a certain Torah scholar who gained a bad reputation due to\n  rumors about his conduct. Rav Yehuda said: What should be done? To\n  excommunicate him is not an option. The Sages need him, as he is a\n  great Torah authority. Not to excommunicate him is also not an option,\n  as then the name of Heaven would be desecrated.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Yehuda said to Rabba bar bar Ḥana: Have you heard anything with\n  regard to this issue? He said to him: <strong>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:\n  What is the meaning of that which is written: “For the priest’s lips\n  should keep knowledge, and they should seek Torah at his mouth; for he\n  is a messenger [malakh] of the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 2:7)? This\n  verse teaches: If the teacher is similar to an angel [malakh] of the\n  Lord, then seek Torah from his mouth, but if he is not pure and\n  upright, then do not seek Torah from his mouth; even if he is\n  knowledgeable about Torah, do not learn from him.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Based on this statement, Rav Yehuda ostracized that Torah scholar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that the only criterion is that the teacher should be \"pure and upright\".

Forty years later, the dead are resurrected, by descending order of righteousness; first the dead of Israel, then the dead in the Diaspora.  </p>\n\n<p>The body will be rebuilt from the <em>luz</em> bone [Genesis R. 28:3], a tiny but very tough bone in the spine. (Read: DNA, Jurassic Park, etc.).  You will come back exactly as you went. [Genesis R. 95:1; also Sanhedrin 91b]</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand</strong>, Berakhot 17a tells us that our life after death will be purely spiritual.  The Rambam summarizes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are no bodies and no bodily forms in the World to Come… There is no eating or drinking there, nor is there anything which the human body needs in this world.  Nor does there occur there any of the events which occur to the human body in this world, such as sitting, standing, sleep, death, distress, laughter, and so forth.  The ancient sages say: \"In the World to Come, there is no eating or drinking or procreation, but the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads and bask in the radiance of the Divine Presence...  There is no way for us in this world to know or comprehend the great goodness which the soul experiences in the world to come, for in this world we know only of material pleasures, and it is these we desire. [Rambam, Yad, Teshuvah 8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So: What are the sources for <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> we will transition from having a physical body to having none?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In his introduction to his commentary on the mishnah in Pereq Cheileq, where the Rambam lists the famous 13 Articles of Faith, the 13th is belief in a bodily resurrection of the dead.</p>\n\n<p>However, he explains that this is not the World to Come, the ultimate reward. Rather, it is a temporary second life, in which we get to live on the plane we were supposed to had Adam and Chavah not eaten the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. And then there is a second death, and a return to the World to Come.</p>\n\n<p>There were those who tried to read another non-physical understanding into what he wrote about resurrection, so the Rambam wrote the Epistle on the Resurrection of the Dead. Among the quotes that make it clear (translation mine of <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mekorot/thiyat-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Tibbon's translation from the original Judeo-Arabic</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When it was the contract-date year 1500, we received a letter from the lands of Yemen ... We explained to them [in response] that שתחיית המתים פינת התורה, והוא שוב הנפש לגוף -- the resurrection of the dead is a cornerstone of the Torah, and it is the return of the soul to the body, and do not reinterpret it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Rambam's worldview, the ultimate good can only be  the experience of G-d without the distraction or filtering of having a body. So to him, that's the World to Come.</p>\n\n<p>The Ran (on Avodah Zarah 20b) similarly believes in a resurrection to a temporary life. But for him the purpose of this second life is Divine Justice. The entity that sinned was combined body and soul, and so must be the entity that is judged.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban (Shaar haGemul) and the majority opinion (Emunos VeDeos 6:4; Raavad Hilchos Teshuvah 8:8, Kesef Mishneh 8:2; Shelah: Beis David; Chida, Avodas HaKodesh 2:41), on the other hand, believes that the post-resurrection life IS eternal, and IS the World to Come.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, there is some role in their picture for a physical resurrection.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>In his work called Chelek, Maimonides made it clear that the intellect (soul) goes to the world to come.[1] He posits that since the world to come will be so blissful when the intellect joins the higher intellect, why then, should the soul wish to rejoin with the body during physical resurrection? The Shem Tov ben Yosef Shem Tom captures his thinking. He writes that he [Maimondies] “did not believe in a physical resurrection.” In the Mishneh Torah, he writes that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“In the hereafter neither a body nor a body shape exists, but the souls of the righteous without bodies.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Classical Judaism and Talmud(s) state that after the arrival of the messiah, a period will be followed by resurrection. However, many think this notion was brought from Zoroastrianism and Babylon. The closest hint to a bodily resurrection in the Bible can be found in Daniel 12 which is debatable. Contrary to this thinking, Maimonides felt that natural law is fixed and needs no change. The only difference in the messianic age (or olam haba) is that Jews will live in Israel and not be submerged under foreign rule nor will they be subject to enslavement by other nations. Although he does not deny a physical resurrection in his treatise, it has been noted that some scholars doubt whether he ever wrote the Treatise on Resurrection, however, that too is debatable. </p>\n\n<p>In any event, a contemporary of Maimonides, Rabbi Abraham ben David wrote in his glosses on Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 8:2, “The words of this man seem to me to be similar to one who says that there is no resurrection for bodies, only souls.”[2]</p>\n\n<p>In short, the Rambam says it will be a spiritual resurrection. A resurrection of the soul. It is still a resurrection. </p>\n\n<p>[1] Soul can also be translated as the nefesh or neshama.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Commentary to Mishnah, introduction to Perek Chelek and Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuvah 8.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why didn't the Egyptian people react violently to the Plagues?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Egyptian people surely knew that the Jewish people were immune to the plagues. Many must have suspected that these catastrophes were happening to them on our account. (Either through Moshe's warnings being leaked to the general population, or by realizing that the Jews were the only people who were unaffected.)</p>\n<p>Now, after supernatural events have been plaguing and torturing them: Why didn't these superstitious people do what they have traditionally done throughout the ages — blame the Jews, and either exile us or try to kill us? Or march to the palace and try to overthrow Pharaoh? Why were the Egyptians so passive?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The dimensions in which the G-dly plagues hit the Egyptians left them without any power nor desire for any immediate 'revenge'. One might argue: Revenge against whom, though? Against G-d? These supernatural wonders that occured during that time were way out of league from the things that non-Jews later on accused Jewish people for during our exile in europe. Egypt was powerless in the face of the Ten Plagues.</p>\n<p>However, as already mentioned, once the Plagues subsided (the tenth and final one, the death of the Egyptian's firstborn), it didn't take too long when Pharaoh and an army of his set their way to 'annihilate the Jews' in gentile, Japhreth fashion. But it didn't work that time, didn't it. :p</p>\n<p>What I'd like to emphasize is that Jews did in fact die during those times. Not through Egyptian's hand, though.</p>\n<p>'Then followed the ninth plague. For several days all of Egypt was enveloped in a thick and impenetrable veil of darkness which extinguished all lights kindled. The Egyptians were gripped with fear, and remained glued to their places wherever they stood or sat. Only in Goshen, where the children of Israel dwelt, there was light. But not all of the Jews were saved from this plague. There were a few who wanted to be regarded as Egyptians rather than as members of the Hebrew race, and who tried, therefore, to imitate the Egyptians in everything, or, as we call it, to assimilate themselves. They did not want to leave Egypt. These people died during the days of darkness.'</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1653/jewish/The-Ten-Plagues.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1653/jewish/The-Ten-Plagues.htm</a></p>\n<p>Plague 9.

And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses,\nand for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses; and he fed\nthem with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. יח\nוַתִּתֹּם, הַשָּׁנָה הַהִוא, וַיָּבֹאוּ אֵלָיו בַּשָּׁנָה הַשֵּׁנִית\nוַיֹּאמְרוּ לוֹ לֹא-נְכַחֵד מֵאֲדֹנִי, כִּי אִם-תַּם הַכֶּסֶף\nוּמִקְנֵה הַבְּהֵמָה אֶל-אֲדֹנִי:  לֹא נִשְׁאַר לִפְנֵי אֲדֹנִי,\nבִּלְתִּי אִם-גְּוִיָּתֵנוּ וְאַדְמָתֵנוּ.    18 And when that year was\nended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him: 'We will\nnot hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds\nof cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord,\nbut our bodies, and our lands. יט  לָמָּה נָמוּת לְעֵינֶיךָ,\nגַּם-אֲנַחְנוּ גַּם אַדְמָתֵנוּ--קְנֵה-אֹתָנוּ וְאֶת-אַדְמָתֵנוּ,\nבַּלָּחֶם; וְנִהְיֶה אֲנַחְנוּ וְאַדְמָתֵנוּ, עֲבָדִים לְפַרְעֹה,\nוְתֶן-זֶרַע וְנִחְיֶה וְלֹא נָמוּת, וְהָאֲדָמָה לֹא תֵשָׁם.   19\nWherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy\nus and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen unto\nPharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the\nland be not desolate.' כ  וַיִּקֶן יוֹסֵף אֶת-כָּל-אַדְמַת מִצְרַיִם,\nלְפַרְעֹה, כִּי-מָכְרוּ מִצְרַיִם אִישׁ שָׂדֵהוּ, כִּי-חָזַק עֲלֵהֶם\nהָרָעָב; וַתְּהִי הָאָרֶץ, לְפַרְעֹה.     20 So Joseph bought all the\nland of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field,\nbecause the famine was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.\nכא  וְאֶת-הָעָם--הֶעֱבִיר אֹתוֹ, לֶעָרִים:  מִקְצֵה גְבוּל-מִצְרַיִם,\nוְעַד-קָצֵהוּ.    21 And as for the people, he removed them city by\ncity, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end\nthereof. כב  רַק אַדְמַת הַכֹּהֲנִים, לֹא קָנָה:  כִּי חֹק לַכֹּהֲנִים\nמֵאֵת פַּרְעֹה, וְאָכְלוּ אֶת-חֻקָּם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן לָהֶם\nפַּרְעֹה--עַל-כֵּן, לֹא מָכְרוּ אֶת-אַדְמָתָם.    22 Only the land of\nthe priests bought he not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh,\nand did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold\nnot their land. כג  וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹסֵף אֶל-הָעָם, הֵן קָנִיתִי אֶתְכֶם\nהַיּוֹם וְאֶת-אַדְמַתְכֶם לְפַרְעֹה; הֵא-לָכֶם זֶרַע, וּזְרַעְתֶּם\nאֶת-הָאֲדָמָה.    23 Then Joseph said unto the people: 'Behold, I have\nbought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for\nyou, and ye shall sow the land. כד  וְהָיָה, בַּתְּבוּאֹת, וּנְתַתֶּם\nחֲמִישִׁית, לְפַרְעֹה; וְאַרְבַּע הַיָּדֹת יִהְיֶה לָכֶם לְזֶרַע\nהַשָּׂדֶה וּלְאָכְלְכֶם, וְלַאֲשֶׁר בְּבָתֵּיכֶם--וְלֶאֱכֹל\nלְטַפְּכֶם.   24 And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye\nshall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\nand for food for your little ones.' כה  וַיֹּאמְרוּ, הֶחֱיִתָנוּ;\nנִמְצָא-חֵן בְּעֵינֵי אֲדֹנִי, וְהָיִינוּ עֲבָדִים לְפַרְעֹה.     25 <strong>And\nthey said: 'Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find favour in the sight\nof my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves'</strong> כו  וַיָּשֶׂם אֹתָהּ\nיוֹסֵף לְחֹק עַד-הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה עַל-אַדְמַת מִצְרַיִם,\nלְפַרְעֹה--לַחֹמֶשׁ:  רַק אַדְמַת הַכֹּהֲנִים, לְבַדָּם--לֹא הָיְתָה,\nלְפַרְעֹה.    26 <strong>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of\nEgypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land\nof the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.</strong>   כז  וַיֵּשֶׁב יִשְׂרָאֵל\nבְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם, בְּאֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן; וַיֵּאָחֲזוּ בָהּ, וַיִּפְרוּ\nוַיִּרְבּוּ מְאֹד.    27 <em>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the\nland of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were\nfruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only reason the Israelites were not immediately made slaves was because Joseph sustained them during the famine and the very harsh policies he enacted. According to these laws most Egyptians would become slaves to Pharaoh, would have had 1/5 of their food taken away, and would have their population shifted based on the needs of the government. The only ones initially exempt from this were the Israelites due to the influence of Joseph. But it also seems like this \"special treatment\" from Joseph led to their being a growing unrest against the Israelites not just from Pharaoh, but from a large swathe of the Egyptian populace as well. We see hints of this because Pharaoh needs to ask his people to do evil against the Israelites, he can't just order his men to do it because then it would make him look too bad. Instead he tries to craftily reduce the Israelite numbers, and tries to get the local population to participate in it.</p>\n<p>Exodus 1:22</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כב  וַיְצַו פַּרְעֹה, לְכָל-עַמּוֹ לֵאמֹר:  כָּל-הַבֵּן הַיִּלּוֹד,\nהַיְאֹרָה תַּשְׁלִיכֻהוּ, וְכָל-הַבַּת, תְּחַיּוּן.  {פ}  22 And\nPharaoh charged all his people, saying: 'Every son that is born ye\nshall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.'\n{P}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I bring this up because this event probably ended up being well known amongst most people in Egypt, even amongst Egyptians who didn't participate in these genocide. And I would argue it's this event that leads to the Egyptian population being understanding and compassionate toward the Israelites, even as these plagues cause them problems. My argument is based on the first plague that God sends against the Egyptians, which is a twofold statement. The nile will turn red with blood so that way the Israelites understand God knows and saw what happened with them, and so that way the Egyptians understand that this murder they participated in as a country all those years ago is why these plagues against you are happening now.</p>\n<p>It also helps explain why there was a great mixed multitude that left Egypt with the Israelites. These peoples were probably also slaves, and are also aware that God is defending a slave people against injustice, for which Egypt as a country is guilty.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Interestingly, there is a tradition that in addition to the suffering of the Egyptians, 15m Jews were killed during the plagues, probably because they did not fully observe Judaism or at least what was attainable at that time. People also felt that the Pharaoh was a god and perhaps felt timid to rebel. After the death of Pharaoh's firstborn, he released the Jews from bondage (actually G-d's doing). Then, as if in normal goyim fashion, they tried to kill or recapture the recently emancipated slaves at the Sea of Reeds.</p>\n\n\n",

Why is this not the same for giving <em>tzedakah</em> (charity)?   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>Great question. A writer from the Houston Community Kollel has surveyed historical answers to this famous question (<a href=\"https://www.torchweb.org/torah_detail.php?id=476\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1) The great medieval commentator <strong>Rashba</strong> (1235-1310) in his\n  Responsa (1:18) offers the following rule: <strong>Any mitzvah which is not\n  entirely in the hands of the one performing it, as it requires the\n  participation of another person for its fulfilment</strong>, e.g. the mitzvah\n  of tzedakah which requires that a poor person accept the charity for\n  the mitzvah to be fulfilled, no blessing is recited before performing\n  it. [The logic behind this rule could be that if the giver recites a\n  blessing and then the poor person refuses to take the tzedakah, the\n  giver will have uttered a blessing and G-ds Name in vain.] BTW, this\n  rule also explains why no blessing is recited before the mitzvos of\n  Honoring Ones Parents, Visiting the Sick, and Returning a Lost Object.</p>\n  \n  <p>(2) <strong>Rabbi Elazar of Worms</strong> (c. 1176-1238), writes in his Sefer\n  HaRokeach (ch. 366) that the Sages did not ordain a blessing before\n  any mitzvah like tzedakah, <strong>which is based on logic and common sense\n  and is therefore performed by non-Jews as well</strong>. The reason for this\n  rule is because the entire purpose of our doing mitzvos is to sanctify\n  ourselves and to help us lead more elevated and spiritual lives than\n  those around us - as we say in the standard form of blessing before\n  performing a mitzvah: Who has sanctified us with His commandments.\n  However, when performing a mitzvah that is also performed by non-Jews,\n  as in the case of tzedakah, our sanctification as Jews is not readily\n  evident and thus no blessing is recited.</p>\n  \n  <p>(3) The <strong>Avudraham</strong> writes that the Sages <strong>did not ordain a\n  blessing before the performance of a mitzvah which involves another\n  persons pain</strong>. A poor person often feels pained and embarrassed to\n  have to receive tzedakah, and it is improper and inappropriate to\n  recite a blessing at another person's misfortune.</p>\n  \n  <p>(4) The <strong>Maharsham</strong> (1835-1911) in his Halachic commentary Daas\n  Torah (YD #61) writes that we don't make a blessing before performing\n  the mitzvah of tzedakah <strong>because it's really not our money to give\n  away</strong>. We are just agents of G-d who are holding the money that G-d\n  gave us for safekeeping until a poor person comes along and G-d\n  commands us to give it to him. As King David is quoted as saying in I\n  Chronicles 29:14: \"For everything is from You, and from Your hand have\n  we given it to you\". We thus don't recite a blessing on the act of\n  giving tzedakah since G-d is really doing all the work, not us.</p>\n  \n  <p>(5) Other commentators suggest a more practical reason why the Sages\n  did not ordain a blessing to be recited before giving tzedakah to a\n  poor person. They were worried that <strong>the poor person to whom we give\n  tzedakah might be a cheater and not as poor as we think</strong>, and then no\n  mitzvah will have been fulfilled and the blessing will have been made\n  in vain. Unfortunately, the Jewish people have had a long history of\n  cheaters living among us who masquerade as poor people but in reality\n  are quite wealthy. As Rabbi Elazar is quoted in the Talmud as saying\n  well over 1500 years ago (see Kesubos 67b-68a), Come let us be\n  grateful to the cheaters, for were it not for them we [who do not\n  always respond to every appeal for tzedakah] would be considered\n  sinners every day [but due to the many cheaters out there we are off\n  the hook somewhat].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Great job to the community's very active involvement in combing through every question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I've always been used to hearing people say in Hallel:\n\"Milifnei Adon chuli aretz, milifnei <strong>Eloha</strong> Yaakov\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.114.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Text_Only&ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 114,7</a>)\n(מלפני אדון חולי ארץ מלפני אלוה יעקב). (Of course, this name of HaShem also appears in other parts of Prayer and Scriptures.)</p>\n<p>But it turns out that in Dikduk in Lashon Hakodesh, there is a rule of Patach Genuvah, which makes it that the \"ah\" noise of the patach is pronounced before that letter is pronounced. Even though I have come across two naysayers who have argued with me, I spoke with Rabbis and confirmed that this rule applies to this word. I spoke with a Rabbi in Lakewood, and a Rabbi in Clifton, and with Rabbi Moshe Meiselman. (In the linked file later on, I bring an excerpt from R' Shabsai Sofer who explicitly addresses the pronunciation and common misconception regarding this word.)</p>\n<p>So the proper way to pronounce that word (the name of HaShem) is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to Ashkenazim: <strong>Elo-'ah</strong></li>\n<li>According to Sepharadim: <strong>Elo-wah</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When practicing or teaching this to others, please be careful to not say the actual name of HaShem (this is one of the unerasable names). You can say, \"'Elo-, and then, -ah\". Or, you can say the whole Passuk.</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested, I compiled some Mareh Mekomos (source sheets) that discuss this rule of dikduk. <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/aga2mxecyiy082f/Patach%20Genuvah%20Packet.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> (If you print these papers, please treat them with holiness, and dispose of them only by burial/genizah.)</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n\n\n",

Since the B\"Y Edition, it has become customary for just about every new edition of Shem Hagedolim to have new sections and/or footnotes added to the original text (<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/heb/podcast/%D7%A9%D7%9D-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7-%D7%90/id1539683920?i=1000497980832\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>). R' Krengel added info mostly about Polish rabbis and books that the Chida wasn't aware of or had come out after his death, but he also added a number of footnotes which he titled \"Hagahot Menachem Tzion\". The OP's quote is from one of those footnotes.</p>\n<p>The \"Maskilim\" here, I believe, is a reference to a kuntress called \"<a href=\"https://ia800200.us.archive.org/28/items/givatyerushalayi00wies/givatyerushalayi00wies.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Givat Yerushalayim: Chakirah Al HaTalmud HaYerushalmi, Mekoro, Inyano U'Zmano</a>\" by <a href=\"http://steinheim-institut.de:50580/cgi-bin/work3?id=1876\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Dr. Yonah Wiesner</a>, and by extension, the other maskilim who agreed with him, or partially agreed with him. The kuntress came out in 1871, a little over 30 years before R' Krengel came out with his Shem Hagedolim. In the kuntress, R' Wiesner sets out to prove that not only was the Yerushalmi not written before the Bavli, but it was written either by a Karaite or a Karaite-sympathizer, building over an old tosefta and was intended as a work of satire, mocking the rabbis and strengthening the Karaite positions. I'll bring some examples:</p>\n<p>Pg. 7-8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואגב אורחא לא אכחד שמה שנמצא בירושלמי (שם פ\"ב ה\"ד): \"א\"ר חייא חובא אנא מן יומי לא כוונית אלא חד זמן בעי מכוונה והרהרית בלבי ואמרית מאן עליל קומי מלכא קדמי ארקבסה או ריש גלותא, שמואל אמר אנא מנית אפרוחיא, ר' בון בר חייא אמר אנא מנית דימוסיא, א\"ר מתניה אנא מחזזק טיבו לראשי דכד הוה מטי מודים הוא כרע מגמריה\", לדעתי שקר גמור הוא, יען אלו המורים אנשי השם ובראשם ר' חייא רבא בודאי התפללו בכונה כיאות לאנשים צדיקים יראי ה', ואם לפעמים באשר יציר אדמה היו, לא עלתה בידם לטהר את מחשבתם כראוי, בודאי היו חסים על כבוד קונם ולא היו מתפארים בכך כאחד הריקים. ומה לו לר' חייא רבא שהיה שרוי בא\"י לחשוב מחשבות על ריש גלותא ועל אלקפתא שבבבל או בפרס מה לו ולהם? אלא ודאי כל הדברים האלו בדוים הם, ואולי חכם או מעתיק מבני מקרא כתבם להתלוץ על גדולי הרבנים, כאשר נראה להלן ששלטו הקראים בתלמוד הירושלמי ועשו בו כרצונם.\"</p>\n<p>\"and by the way, I won't deny that what's written in the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.17b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there 2:4</a>): \"Said Rabbi Chiya [not too sure how to translate this line, but he's saying that during prayer, he would think about the king or about the reish galuta], Shmuel said: \"I would count chicks\", R' Bon bar Chiyah said: \"I would count [dimosiya], said R' Matanyah I would fasten [tivu] to my head [something about bowing during modim]\", In my understanding this is a complete lie, for all of these teachers were great people and above them R' Chiya Rabah who surely prayed with concetration, as befits righteous men, Hashem-fearers, and if they would sometimes be as a creation of the earth, and they didn't manage to purify their thoughts as needed, surely they would grace the honor of their Lord and wouldn't boast like one of the simpletons. And what did R' Chiya, who lived in Eretz Yisrael, have to do with thinking about the reish galuta and the Alkafta in Bavel or Persia, what did he have to do with them? From this we see that all of these things were invented, and perhaps a sage or a scribe from the Bnei Mikra [early name of the Karaites] wrote these things to mock the rabbinical giants, as we shall see later on how the Karaites controlled the Talmud Yerushalmi and did with it as they pleased.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pg. 13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בירושלמי (שבת פ\"א ה\"ד): איתא: תנא ר' יהושע אונייא, תלמידי ב\"ש עמדו להן מלמטה והיו הורגין בתלמידי בית הלל, תני ששה מהן עלו והשאר עמדו עליהן בחרבות וברמחים\". על הדבר הזה ישתומם כל נבון, מי שמע כאלה שיהיו חכמי ישראל הורגין זה את זה, ובקנאתם קנאת סופרים ימהרו לשפוך דם נקי ח\"ו, ואדרבא אמרו בתוספתא (יבמות י\"ד ע\"ב) אע\"פ שנחלקו ב\"ש וב\"ה בצרות וכו' לא נמנעו ב\"ש לישא נשים מב\"ה ולא ב\"ה מב\"ש, ללמדך שחיבה וריעות נוהגים זה בזה לקיים מה שנאמר האמת והשלום אהבו. אלא ודאי נשתקע הדבר ולא נאמר והמחבר הירושלמי בדא את הסיפור המכוער מלבו. – וכאן המקום להעיר איך הקראים הסתייעו בזה המאמר של הירושלמי להוכיח בכל דור ודור עד שאיש את רעהו הרגו בחרב. והחכם הקראי סלמון בן ירוחם (885-960) לא נתעצל לכתת את רגליו מא\"י לבבל ובידו תלמוד ירושלמי סדר מועד עם פירוש יעקב בן אפרים (זה המפרש לא נודע שמו במחנה הרבנים בלי ספק גם הוא קראי היה והם החולמים הם הפותרים) לדבר משפטים עם רס\"ג, שהחליט, שחכמי ישראל אף שחולקים זה עם זה בהלכה, בכל זאת אהבה ואחוה היתה ביניהם (עיי' רש\"פ לקוטי קדמוניות, נספחים צד י\"ד). וזה דרכם של הקראים להמציא ספרים מזויפים על שם חכמים הראשונים...\"</p>\n<p>\"In the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.9a.3?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 1:4</a>) it is brought: R' Yehoshua Oniyah taught, The students of Beit ShamMai stood beneath them and would kill by the students of Beit Hillel, we learned that six of them rose and the rest stood over them with swords and spears\". On this any intelligent person will wonder at, who ever heard that the sages of Yisrael would kill one another, and in their zeal of scribes would rush to spill clean blood Cha\"V, but the opposite, in the tosefta (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.14b.10?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 14b</a>) Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel refrain from marrying women from Beit Shammai. This serves to teach you that they practiced affection and camaraderie between them, to fulfill that which is stated: \"Love truth and peace\". Surely, this was hidden and not stated and the author of the Yerushalmi invented this ugly story. - And here it is the place to state that the Karaites were assisted by this story of the Yerushalmi to prove in every generation that it was until a man slew his friend by the sword. And the Karaite scholar Salmon ben Yerucham (885-960) was not lazy and went from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel and in his hand the Talmud Yerushalmi, Seder Mo'ed with the commentary of <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8404-jacob-ben-ephraim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaakov ben Efraim</a> (this commentator was not known by the encampment of the rabbis, without a doubt he was also a Karaite, and they who dream are those who solve), to argue with RaSa\"G, who decided, that though the sages of Yisrael disagree with one another in halacha, there was still love and friendship among them (see RS\"P <a href=\"https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/fs1/object/display/bsb10239845_00219.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Kadmoniyot, appendix pg. 14</a>). And that is the way of the Karaites to invent forged books upon the name of the early sages...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pg. 52:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...לכן שפטתי משפט צדק שהתלמוד ירושלמי חובר בין אלף ע\"ב, לאלף ר\"י דהיינו בין 760-900 למספר הרגיל.\"</p>\n<p>\"...therefore I judged justly that the Talmud Yerushalmi was written between the elef ayin-bet, and the elef reish-yud, meaning 760-900 to the regular [secular] count.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The year 760 is right around the time of the rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anan_ben_David\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Anan ben David</a>, the father of the Karaite movement.</p>\n<p>And there are many, many more examples throughout the kuntress. He deals with chronological problems, with evidence for the Yerushalmi being older than the Bavli, several \"mini-issues\" such as R' Elazar ben Hyrcanus and so forth. Interestingly, he makes it clear that his intention is not to simply put down the Yerushalmi, but that he wanted to lift up and empower the Bavli (the more liberal maskilim at the time mocked all rabbinical texts, after all).</p>\n<p>The publisher wrote in the beginning that he decided to print this text because he thought that R' Wiesner made many good points, though he didn't agree with all of them. Perhaps for this reason, he attached at the end refutations of several of the points.

From the Karaites in the seventh century to the Yevsektzia (the Jewish section of the Bolshevik party that Stalin would later purge) in the twentieth century, the Talmud was vilified and its pages torn and destroyed by Jews who were bitterly opposed to its teachings and who recognized that no \"new\" form of Judaism could ever take hold as long as the Talmud was still studied, respected and loved within the Jewish world\".</p>\n<br>\nIn addition many unintentional corruptions happened: \n<br>\n<br>\nThe Yerushalmi text that we have contains many corrupt passages. When a new Yerushalmi manuscript was written, errors crept in; and since very few people were learning the Yerushalmi, there was no one to correct them. As each subsequent manuscript was copied from the previous one, old errors were copied and new ones were added. This is the main problem with our current text of the Yerushalmi. Correcting these errors is very difficult and sometimes impossible, as our printed text of the Yerushalmi is based on the Leiden Manuscript (written in 1289), the only extant complete manuscript of the Yerushalmi. There are, however, various partial manuscripts that can help us reconstruct some corrupted texts. \n<p>Fortunately, today we have access to many partial manuscripts which often shed light on obscure and corrupt passages. 108 : Ḥakirah, The Flatbush Journal of Jewish Law and Thought The first manuscript to which one should turn is the Vatican Manuscript. This manuscript is very corrupt and there is hardly a line without an error. The copyist who wrote the Vatican Manuscript had absolutely no knowledge of the text he was copying. He therefore made many obvious errors. For example, the letters כו are sometimes copied as מ .A ה is copied as a ח ,and a ב as a כ ,etc. These errors are easy to discern and interpret. But the weakness of this manuscript is also its greatest strength. The copyist never dared make any “corrections” to the text since he had no knowledge of it. He thus preserved, to a large extent, the integrity of the text of the manuscript from which he copied.</p>\n<p>Another manuscript that sheds light on many corrupt passages is that of R. Solomon Sirillio, which survives in two manuscript versions known as MS. Paris 1389 (his earlier manuscript) and MS. London 403–405 (his later manuscript). These manuscripts contain many variant readings, some of which are found in the Rishonim. When reading these manuscripts, however, it is important to differentiate between variant texts that R. Sirillio copied from an older manuscript (which are more valuable), versus changes he made to the text himself. (<a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%201%20Zelcer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>)</p>\n<p>The editio princeps of the Jerusalem Talmud is the Venice edition printed by Daniel Bomberg (1523–24), published after the completion of the printing of the Babylonian Talmud (1523) and before he undertook the printing of the Yad of Maimonides which was completed the following year. This edition is based upon the sole extant manuscript of the Jerusalem Talmud, the Leiden manuscript, which was written by Jehiel b. Jekuthiel b. Benjamin ha-Rofe in 1289. The scribe explicitly states that he copied it from a woefully corrupt text, full of errors; although he had attempted to correct it as much as possible, \"I know that I have not corrected even half of the mistakes,\" and he begs the indulgence of his readers. In addition to those mistakes, it is evident from statements and quotations of the rishonim that the scribes in many cases freely changed the orthography characteristic of the original text to make it accord with the accepted spelling and terminology of the Babylonian Talmud. For instance it is specifically stated that in the Jerusalem Talmud אדם is spelled אדן, yet those differences have been eliminated from the manuscript.

Firstly the previous sentence is already closed, Secundly, the case is not entirely similar to the previous because only one of the dinim regards it. </p>\n\n<p>There is a disagreement between Rashi and Ramban in one side, and Tosfot and probably Rambam in a second side, if Yabam 9 and one day old can make ybum Deorayita. But anyways, halachically he has restrictions that his Ybum is not more than a Maamar for an adult Yabam. According To the Ramban and Rashi, it seems that if he died and there is an other brother, we easily can assume that his widow can make Ybum mideorayta. So the boy with a doubt regarding being 9 and one day old, is a safek deorayta and his widow needs to make chalitsa as said in the dinim of the second paragraph. For a very clear formulation of the Rashi line, see Chidushe Haran Nidda 45a</p>\n\n<p>So, I don't understand why this apparently not Dachuk pshat is not the pshat of the Gemara. </p>\n\n<p>To understand easily the topic, read the link to the translation of Mishna in the Gemara Sefaria above. </p>\n\n<p>Note. We can formulate the question as this. Lichora we have a proof for Tosfot, because according to Tosfot safek ben yabam who died, his wife is safek derabanan and ptura from chalitsa.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have perhaps an answer. The words concerning the boys who are in a doubtful status aren't linked to any attribute. So we need to search if they can be linked to one the cases in the first paragraph. </p>\n\n<p>For the boy about whom we have a doubt if he is 9 and one day old, the natural tendency is to link him to the case of the boy who is 9 and one day old. The partial sentence about him is an appendix, \"and the same is true even if there is a doubt if he did reach 9 and one day\". </p>\n\n<p>But regarding the boy with the doubt about two pubic hairs there is less similarity with the first list and we can link him to each paragraph and it's better to associate him to the more mechudash case.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Moshe Feinstein writes (Igros Moshe 1, 128) that measuring one's temperature is not included in the gezeira of medida, i.e., measuring weight or volume of foods. He writes while it is praiseworthy to be stringent, one is not required to do so. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa (the standard Halachic guide for Shabbos and Yomtov) in the name of R' Aurbach concurs with this view (40, footnote 3). Although they both deal specifically with measuring the temperature of humans, the logic applies to meat thermometers as well, as measuring of temps is not be included in the issur of medida.</p>\n<p>Another point, according to SA (OC 504, 4) one may use a measuring device for spices since it is meant to prevent the overcooking and burning of the food. The above heter should be logically applied to meat thermometers as well, since the meat will be overcooked or undercooked without it, in such a case it should eb permitted (even if it were included in the issur of medida). This is the case even according to the mishna berura (ibid, 22), since people would generally use a meat thermometer on expensive meats during the week as well (it's just less common for people to eat expensive meats on common days).</p>\n<p>For more sources on this, see <a href=\"https://asktherav.com/17114-can-i-use-a-non-electric-thermometer-on-yom-tov-to-measure-the-tenderness-of-meat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps turning lights on or off is a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">melacha</a>. On Chol Ha'moed, melacha is <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/holidays/sukkot/hilchos-chol-hamoed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sometimes</a>, but not always, permitted.</p>\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>During Chol Ha'moed, it's definitely allowed to shut a light off if it'll help you sleep.  And I assume it's also allowed to shut lights off in the evening, since a gradually-darkening environment <a href=\"https://sleep.mysplus.com/library/category2/article1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">may help the body to prepare for sleep</a>.  Finally, I assume it's probably also fine to shut off a shul's lights, since many shuls have huge expensive banks of bright fluorescent lights.</p>\n<p>But I wonder if you can shut off your house's indoor lights during the daytime, to save electricity.</p>\n<p>Maybe, if you left all your house's incandescent lights on all day during all of Chol Ha'moed, it would cause a <a href=\"https://www.congkins.org/pesach---chol-hamoed.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">significant financial loss</a>. Or maybe not. I dunno.</p>\n<p>Perhaps instantaneous melachot might be treated differently than long, laborious melachot.

    "content": "# Meaning of \"Don't deviate from the verdict right or left\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While sensible metaphorically, the sentence makes no sense Halachically, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>\"You should pay this man $20, but don't deviate to the right or left.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\"This tool is Tamei, but don't deviate right or left.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\"You can marry this woman, but don't deviate right or left.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\"You can start wearing Tzitzis at 5:45, but don't deviate to the right or to the left.\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rashi says \"אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל יָמִין שֶׁהוּא שְׂמֹאל\" but we could learn that from just about any other example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל היום שֶׁהוּא לילה\"</li>\n<li>\"אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל חתול שֶׁהוּא כלב\", etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why was this phrase chosen to signify deviance from Rabbinical rulings?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are at least two different approaches to answer the question based on precedents in halacha.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Right represents a stronger side and Left represents a weaker side. For example, we put a tefilin on a weaker hand, while we start <em>netilas yadaim</em> in the morning with the stronger hand. Many other halachos are hand specific. In those cases deviations would be deviations of halacha or metaphorically favoring weaker over the stronger or stronger over the weaker when factual evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In making judgement, Right represents \"<em>hesed</em>\" - kindness, mercy; while Left represents <em>Din</em> - justice. For example, when we finish Amidah, we bow down to the left first which corresponds to the right side of Shekhina. In these cases deviations would mean applying strict justice over mercy, or unnecessary mercy over strict justice. A well known statement from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Metzora.1.1?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma, Mezora</a> R. Eleazar said, <em>Anyone who becomes merciful upon the cruel one will end by being cruel to the merciful</em> is an example of deviation left and right in justice.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe, R. Chaim Kanievsky wrote a selection of halachos of left and right hand, where the above factors determined the <em>psak</em>.</p>\n<p>Regarding your examples:</p>\n<p>A. <em>\"You should pay this man $20, but don't deviate to the right or left.\"</em></p>\n<p>Giving $20 is a decision. What the decision was influenced by? If one is giving $20 because the guy looks poor, but he is actually rich - that's deviation to the right - unnecessary mercy. If the man legitimately needs $50, and one can give $50, but only gives $20 because one does not like the way he looks - that's deviation to the left due to strict justice. If one gives $20 because the man will otherwise make threats - that's also deviation to the right - favoring a stronger side. If one is giving $20 because the man looks weak, although he is acting out, that's deviation to the left - favoring a weaker side.</p>\n<p>B. <em>\"This tool is Tamei, but don't deviate right or left.\"</em></p>\n<p>Declaring Tumah on an object is a halakhic decision. How legitimate is this decision? There are different sources of Tumah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keilim 1:1-5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.1.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 1:3</a>), there are different levels of Tumah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Chagigah.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 2:5</a> among other places). Some are stricter, some are more lenient. There are pressing needs and costs of purification. One has to be balanced in making a decision based on a situation, practical considerations, and certainty.</p>\n<p>C. <em>\"You can marry this woman, but don't deviate right or left.\"</em></p>\n<p>This case is the easiest to deviate. Is a person marrying because a woman is beautiful although has bad character traits, or or because she has good character traits although one does not feel interested in her as a person? Is one marrying her because the family is prominent or is one overlooking her because her family is not prominent? (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ta%27anit.4.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Taanis 4:8</a>)</p>\n<p>D. <em>\"You can start wearing Tzitzis at 5:45, but don't deviate to the right or to the left.\"</em></p>\n<p>It depends what 5:45am is. If one wakes up at 5am and zman Tzitzis 5:02am then it could be one way.  If one wakes up at 5:40am, but zman tzitzis is only 6:30 am - those are different considerations. If one also makes a bracha in both cases - then it could be another deviation. If one only wears tzitzis for a short time or all the time - all these can be understood based on circumstances as deviations to the left or to the right, or correct actions.</p>\n<p>One could write here a more traditional view based on ability to recognize a friend depending on one's vision or distinguish between a dog and a wolf, wild donkey and a domestic donkey as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.9b.12?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 9b</a>. At present, these distictions are irrelevant because we set a halachic time on our calendar.</p>\n<p>F. <em>Rashi says \"אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל יָמִין שֶׁהוּא שְׂמֹאל\" but we could learn that from just about any other example:</em></p>\n<p>\"אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל היום שֶׁהוּא לילה\"\n\"אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל חתול שֶׁהוּא כלב\", etc.</p>\n<p><em>Why was this phrase chosen to signify deviance from Rabbinical rulings?</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.11?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi comment on Devarim 17:11</a> is given an extensive explanations by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mizrachi%2C_Deuteronomy.17.11.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliyahu Mizrachi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Devarim.17.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Arieh</a>.</p>\n<p>In the suggested case, the rav states that the ruling is like that of a night (i.e. details are not clear, or halacha like that of a night - say, no mitzvah of tzitzis), but you feel otherwise (or vice versa)</p>\n<p>Also, a dog feels a special connection to its master, but a cat does not know its master (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Horayot.13a.23?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horayos 13a</a>). When dealing with people a rav may make a ruling for a close friend strictly which one may percieve as overly strict. Also for a stranger a rav may decide leniently which one may perceive as overly friendly. There are many variations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This saying is mentioned frequently in the book of Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy 5:29, 17:11, 17:20, and 28:14 for example. \"Do not deviate from the Instruction to the right or to the left\".</p>\n<p>If we look in the Book of Exodus, the three colors of the Tabernacle are blue, purple, and red. They are mentioned 26 times in the book of Exodus, and they are ALWAYS mentioned in the exact order: \"blue, purple, and red\".</p>\n<p>Hebrew language is read right to left. So blue is on the right, purple is always in the middle and red would be on the left.</p>\n<p>By turning to the right or the left, we are not seeing the full picture. If we turn right it is blue, if we turn left it is red. The middle path combines both blue and red (purple). The Torah is telling us to look at the full picture.</p>\n<p>The Tabernacle is called \"the Tent of Meeting\". The meeting point is in the middle (purple).</p>\n<p>Maybe I am wrong, but this is my best guess.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Because left and right are directions- <em>paths</em>. They are ways one can go. At a crossroads one needs to make a decision; left or right (or maybe straight). The Torah is talking parabolically- do not deviate <strong>from the path</strong> the Rabbis set before you- to the left or to the right. Rashi's example is simply based on the Pasuk, just like you may not turn left or right, you must follow the set path even if you are told that what looks right to you is actually left.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is mercy the only characteristic that is quantified?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Hoshana poem <em>L'ma'an Amitach</em>, various characteristics of God are enlisted as a reason for God to save us. The version appearing in my prayerbook, and recited in congregations I have been present at, lists the following characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Truth (אמתך)</li>\n<li>Covenant (בריתך)</li>\n<li>Greatness and splendor (גדלך ותפארתך)</li>\n<li>Law (דתך)</li>\n<li>Grandeur (הודך)</li>\n<li>Assembly (ועודך) </li>\n<li>Remembrance (זכרך)</li>\n<li>Kindness (חסדך)</li>\n<li>Goodness (טובך)</li>\n<li>Oneness (יחודך)</li>\n<li>Honor (כבודך)</li>\n<li>Learning (למודך)</li>\n<li>Kingship (מלכותך)</li>\n<li>Eternity (נצחך)</li>\n<li>Secret (סודך)</li>\n<li>Might (עזך)</li>\n<li>Glory (פארך)</li>\n<li>Righteousness (צדקתך)</li>\n<li>Holiness (קדשתך)</li>\n<li>Abundant mercy (רחמיך הרבים)</li>\n<li>Divine presence (שכינתך)</li>\n<li>Praise (תהלתך)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There seems to be a very obvious \"odd man out\" here. The third-to-last one is the only one in which the characteristic is quantified. We ask God to save us, not on account of his mercy but on account of his <em>abundant</em> mercy. We don't similarly quantify God's holiness, honor, righteousness, kindness, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we specifically quantify God's mercy but not any of the other characteristics? (Obviously, not all of the characteristics can be modified in this fashion, but there are quite a few of them that can be.)</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that the term \"abundant mercy\" appears in a verse in Daniel 9:18, but I don't know if that is relevant to this.</p>\n\n<p>I would also note, that in other prayer contexts \"mercy\" is not uniquely quantified. For instance, in the Avinu Malkeinu prayer, my edition has \"Act for the sake of your abundant mercy\" immediately followed by \"act for the sake of your great, mighty, and awesome name\". Or, for example, in this Yemenite prayerbook, a similar list of God's characteristics does <em>not</em> quantify \"mercy\" any differently from the others:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Sqv7P.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Sqv7P.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

Also  often, is these <em>derashos</em> are rejected due to some flaw, known as a <em>pircha</em>.

It <strong>remains a doubt</strong>, and in fact it could still prove true, if some later evidence appears that it's true.</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if this is his own insight, or is there an earlier source for such an idea, or is this not even a novelty, but the basic understanding of <em>derashos</em>/<em>pirchos</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is not a novelty, as it logically follows. It doesn't even require advanced Torah knowledge to show this, just a bit of critical thinking!</p>\n<p>Consider the following conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Person A: Yosef has a job.</p>\n<p>Person B: How do you know?</p>\n<p>Person A: I saw him at a cash register at a grocery store, so he must work there.</p>\n<p>Person B: Actually, he was just buying food. He doesn't work there!</p>\n<p>Person A: Oh! So I was wrong. So, does that mean Yosef doesn't have a job?</p>\n<p>Person B: No. Yosef could be unemployed, but he could also work work somewhere else. Just because your proof that he has a job is wrong, doesn't mean the conclusion is definitely wrong too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, for any halakha, just because some particular derivation of it is incorrect, doesn't mean the conclusion must be. That isn't to say the conclusion definitely <em>is</em> correct, either, of course. We're essentially back to where we started - it might be true or it might not be and that's all we know. This is what Rabbi Salant is saying. (As a side note, recall that lots of the time rabbis agree on the law in The Talmud, but not on how it was derived. This shows that just because one particular proof was invalid for law X, it's not necessarily the case that no proof is valid for law X.)</p>\n<p>This principle comes up in more places than just Jewish law - you can expect to see it in formal logic, mathematical proofs, and some types of non-Jewish philosophy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ramchal wrote a couple of sefarim on logic esp. as applied to Gemara (derech tevunos and sefer hahigayon). From what I remember, once a kal vachomer has a pircha  asked on it, it is no longer a valid proof at all, and even if the halacha were true, it would need a different source. The exception is if the pircha itself is disproved, leaving the original kal vachomer.</p>\n<p>The reason is that kal vachomer's and other middos have rules, and if the rules aren't satisfied, it is not a derasha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Resurrection of the dead. Only Jews?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the Maimonides' 13 principals is the belief in resurrection of the dead but what is the qualifier for this? Does this only include Jews? Does it only apply to  the righteous? Will Noachides rise again? Could evil Jews or evil gentiles that performed t'shuvah before death rise again? Sources? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>To answer your question fully we first have to define our terms. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is resurrection</strong></p>\n\n<p>In his work called Chelek, Maimonides clearly indicates that the intellect (the nefesh) goes to the world to come and joins the higher intellect.[1] That is to say that there is no physical resurrection, only spiritual. The Shem Tov ben Yosef Shem Tom captures his thinking. He writes that he [Maimondies] “did not believe in a physical resurrection.” In the Mishneh Torah, he confirms this when he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“In the hereafter neither a body nor a body shape exists, but the souls of the righteous without bodies.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Classical Judaism and Talmud(s) state that after the arrival of the messiah, a period will be followed by resurrection. However, many modern scholars now feel that this notion was brought into Judaism from pagan Zoroastrianism and Babylon. Like the names of the months which the rabbi honestly admit came from Babylonian gods. The closest hint to a bodily resurrection in the Bible can be found in Daniel 12 which is debatable. If we take the latter approach and say that resurrection is a spiritual endeavor then the only difference in the messianic age (olam haba) is that Jews will live in Israel and not be submerged under foreign rule nor will they be subject to enslavement by other nations. Although he does not deny a physical resurrection in his treatise, it has been noted by some scholars who doubt whether he ever wrote the Treatise on Resurrection, however, that too is debatable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do only Jews go to heaven?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many traditional Jews feel that only Jews or only righteous Jews living in Israel will resurrect. The political message is obvious: come to Israel. It is also possible that the persecutions by non-Jews would prompt any rational Jew, understandably, to say that non-Jews have no share in the world to come and hence do not get resurrected at all. For example, the Spanish poet, Yehudah Halevi was convinced that Jews are biologically superior to non-Jews. Even Noahides or converts do not meet the criteria of a Jew. They are little better than animals.[2] Addionaonly, Adam, Abraham, Jacob were non-Jews who we'd expect would resurrect.  </p>\n\n<p>Contrary to this racist opinion was Maimonides who believed in universalism. Maimonides was proud to be an observant Jew. He was also proud of the Jewish people yet, he did not think Jews were superior and that this was innate, instilled into the Jewish people. He felt that Jews were no better than other people, save the obeisance of the Torah, respectfully. This being the only distinction of the Jew. But anyone could convert and indeed this would take place in the messianic age.[3]\nRuth was a gentile who converted and Kings David and Solomon, as well as the Messiah, will descend from her. We see from here that gentiles have the same capacity to become the greatest leaders as those who are born to Jewish parents.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Everyone is created b’tzelem Elohim, “in the image of G-d.\" Maimonides defines this image to mean intelligence, hence it is a duty to use one's intellect because that is the closest thing to G-d and it is the thing that separates us from animals. </p>\n\n<p>[1] Commentary to Mishnah, introduction to Perek Chelek and Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuvah 8.</p>\n\n<p>[2] For support of this view see Rabbi Moshe Ben-Chaim's article in the Jewish Times \"Jews: A super Race?\".</p>\n\n<p>[3] For more information please see Menachem Keller who stresses this point in his book Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish people, and again in his article “Chosenness. Not Chauvinism: Maimonides on the Chosen People”</p>\n\n\n",

God grants them time to see how they will correct their behavior, but in the meantime they are passing the mistake on to their children. God is gracious by allowing them this time, but if through their life they do not fix what needs fixing, and also their children fail to fix it, then at some point the children will end up paying. At that point they will also pay for the errors of the preceding generations whom they learned from and failed to correct their mistakes. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>How to read the Bible</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides says in his Guide of the Perplexed 2:48 – that all things ascribed to G-d do not mean that G-d was directly involved; it happened according to the laws of nature.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the text in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95573/17072\">this way</a>, it becomes easy to understand what the Bible is actually telling us. The Tanakh is certainly not ascribing emotions to G-d. While anthropomorphisms usually portray G-d performing human activities, anthropopathisms ascribe human emotions, though G-d does not have emotions. It follows that G-d does not become angry when you sin. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is sin?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Sin (or Chet in Hebrew) is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/105140/17072\">missing the mark</a>. One can make repentance (return or do teshuva) but going to synagogue and returning only to find your wife still angry does not resolve the problem. My grandfather used to say, \"you pay for other people's sin.\" Actions can have a long-lasting effect that lasts for generations. When G-d tells the Israelites that He will curse their children for their iniquities, it means that their children will suffer due to natural law. The Ralbag used exile as an example. If a person acts in an improper way and is exiled from the kingdom as his punishment, his children will be born in exile. See his commentary on Exodus 20:4-5. By using this same line of reasoning, we can see how other actions prompted more than a half dozen tragedies which afflicted King David, with the sole exception of the murder of tens of thousands of Israelites following David ordering a census, were the consequences that followed his adulterous relationship with Bat Sheva and the murder of her husband and the soldiers with him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whether you and others agree or not, there is another concept that I think we need to recognize. The world works according to the laws of nature. One of these laws is that every act has consequences. Whether or not G-d forgives, the consequences do not go away.</p>\n\n<p>In short, you are right. Those who did wrong were punished after they repented (David also repented), but it was because of the consequences of their acts.</p>\n\n\n",

Does G-d want us to have faith? Actually “faith” isn’t in the Hebrew Bible. The world “faith,” emunah, means “steadfast” or “steady.” Thus Moses’ hands were “steadily” held, not faithfully.</p>\n\n<p>We read in Genesis 18 that Abraham debated the verdict with G-d whether to lay waste the city of Sodom. G-d approves of his reasoning and declares that He will spare the city if ten inhabitants are found not guilty. Others followed in Abraham’s footsteps. Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah, felt it was unreasonable for G-d to select them for their divine mission despite Moses being a general in Pharaoh’s army. They questioned G-d to the point where the Judge Gideon asked for proof of his victory. They doubted the reasoning but used their intelligence as G-d desired. </p>\n\n<p>The historian Josephus was so bothered with Noah's willingness to accept the divine decree that he imagined an episode of Noah begging G-d never again to flood the earth. Rabbi Judah in the Midrash Genesis Rabbah questioned Noah’s ‘righteous.’ He said in the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 108a, regarding Noah, that “In a street of totally blind people, a one-eyed man is called clear-sighted, and an infant a scholar.” Rabbi Nehemiah said that while Noah in Genesis 6:9 “walked with G-d,” Abraham in 17:1 walks “before Me [G-d].” which means that Noah had to rely on G-d while Avraham led the way. Some went as far as to say that Noah was only righteous in his generation (and would not be in another) simply because he did not warn anyone about the coming flood.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides also comments on one using his intelligence in his medical book Aphorisms, writing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If anyone tells you that he has proof from his personal experience of something that he needs to confirm his theory, even though he is recognized as a man of great authority and truthfulness – sincere and moral – yet because he is so anxious for you to believe his notion, do not hesitate. Do not allow yourself to be swayed by the novelties that he tells you. Examine his theory and beliefs carefully.... Look into the matter. Don’t let yourself be persuaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it right to obey divine decrees without question? Did this improper act prompt the jihadist to fly plains into buildings simply because they did not use their intelligence to question the Koran and its evil teachings? Must we follow everyone of authority or listen to their arguments, evaluate them, and reject or accept their teaching based on our understanding of them. Indeed the Mishnah, Pirke Avot 2:6 says that: “An individual who acts without reason can still be a righteous fool.”</p>\n\n\n",

The different levels of holiness are listed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Kelim.1.6?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kelim 1:6-9</a>. A house of study isn't holy in this sense of the word. For example, when the Torah requires eating sacrifices in a holy place (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.7.6?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 7:6</a>), a house of study wouldn't qualify as \"holy\" for this purpose; only the designated places, first in the Tabernacle and finally in the Temple. So by this definition, it would follow that a house of study outside of the Temple can't be holier than the Temple.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Moses was instructed to remove shoes when he saw the Burning Bush because the place is holy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground (Exodus 3,5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to enter the temple wearing shoes.

Why did G-d choose a bush to reveal Himself? Why was the bush not consumed? Was it a miracle or, was it drawing oil from beneath the ground as scientist Colin J. Humphreys claims in his “The Miracles of Exodus.” Are you bothered if the event was natural? How does this make you feel? What about the revelation. What exactly is “revelation”? Does G-d speak? Does G-d have vocal cords? Is it possible that a person can hear G-d’s voice and yet show disobedience, as in the case of Moses? Does G-d become angry? The Rambam says that G-d does not have emotions. If G-d did not speak, was it inspiration or insight—but nevertheless an act he was uncertain about. If it was G-d’s voice as the Bible implies, was it a small still voice as with Elijah or was it fiery thunder as with the people at Sinai? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Can a place be holy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Does the earth change in one instance from dirt to holy ground? Can the soil turn holy? In reality, a church or synagogue or mosque is not holy. The earth does not change into holy ground. Because “holy,” actually means “separate.” G-d is separated from us. The Rambam said that nothing is holy per se. The term holiness only comes into effect when people use these things to improve themselves and society. In a proper way. Holiness is the result of actions. The Shabbat is only holy if you keep it. Mount Sinai or the Torah is only holy if we read them. The temples, if we pray in them. Israel is only holy when Jews live there.</p>\n\n\n",

And how does one measure that?  Source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -5)\n\n<p><strong>Why do bad things happen to good people?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since antiquity, philosophers have toiled to answer the question of why good people suffer. I read the novel \"Creation\" by Gore Vidal but did not find any satisfying answer by the two philosophers, Confucius or the Buddha. Though well-intended, there are, to them, two possibilities. Either (1) G-d is not all-good or all-powerful or (2) karma dictates that people should suffer as explained in reincarnation.[1] Both explanations are not satisfactory. I take a third approach. As Rambam pointed out, there are three things that cause suffering (evil). I think Maimonides answered this well.</p>\n\n<p>Since G-d is good, He doe not emit evil. Evil is the result of three things, (1) people harm themselves when stepping in front of a red light or (2) people harm others as when one nation decides to dominate over another or (3) natural law, although good for the world at a whole as when a hurricane cleans the earth may harm people residing near the proximity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is sin?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biblical portion of Behar warns the Israelites to observe G-d’s commands. If they do they are promised property and will “dwell securely on the land” (Leviticus 25:18). </p>\n\n<p>Sin is a transgression of the divine commandment. Though there is two ways to understand sin. The emotional adherents carry unresolved guilt while the rationalist improves. They avoid the destructive sense of guilt and direct their emotions to constructive thought. Surprising as this may sound, “sin” is actually not in the Hebrew Bible. The word is chet, and it means “to miss the mark.” One can imagine an archer releasing his shaft and shooting an arrow, realizing that he missed his target. What do you do when you miss your target? Do you beat your chest, weep devastatingly, and create all kinds of ceremonies to “atone” for the missed shot? No. You consider why you got the disappointing results, reach into your quiver, and shoot again. This rational approach examines why one failed and asserts not to repeat the loss. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is repentance and how does one do teshuva?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Teshuvah 2, explains that the sinner must realize their mistake, resolve not to repeat the mistake again, employ proper habits not to repeat it, and go on with their lives. This concept of chet is mind oriented. It shows how a person can perfect themselves and improve society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides explains that G-d does not have emotions. Thus, G-d does not get angry when you sin. As explained above, chet is a time for improvement. Why then, does the Torah describe G-d with anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms? It is because as Rabbi Ishmael explained, “The Torah speaks in the language of people.” The Bible uses figures of speech because it was composed in a way so that the ancients could grasp its teachings and understand it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is reward and punishment and how does it work?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The biblical portion of Eikev starts with Deuteronomy 7:12 and details what righteous Jews can expect if they act according to the commands. For example, Deuteronomy 7 promises grain, fruit, wine, oil, cattle, flocks, goats, and not infertility, illnesses or enemies. Deuteronomy 11 promises additional rain and grass for the animals to eat. It seems that Jews act righteously only to gain something back in return, namely rewards. But isn't reward and punishment a childish idea? Perhaps scripture speaks of reward and punishment as a way to stimulate proper behavior. </p>\n\n<p>Mishnah Avot 1:3 certainly thinks so when it states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Be not like the servant who serves a master on the condition of receiving a gift; but be like the servant who serves a master not on the condition of receiving an award.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Avot d’Rabbi Natan disagreed, arguing, “Is it conceivable that a laborer works all day and does not take his pay home in the evening?”</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides think</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides stood in stark constant and was opposed to the childish notion of reward and punishment. In his introduction to the tenth chapter of the talmudic tractate of Sanhedrin, Chelek, he wrote, “There are many different opinions, but these are based on differences in understanding.” He felt that when the soul departed the body, it would not enjoy eternal bliss at Garden of Eden nor would the wicked burn in the fiery flames of Gehinnom. He felt that people would not be rewarded in the time of the Messiah or “the world to come,” nor is reward doled out in the resurrection of the dead, he believed this to be spiritual. He rejected these ideas as childish, comparing them to a child who needs to be bribed by candies or an adult by money or reputation as a rabbi. As it would be ridiculous to imagine that G-d punishes fish, so to, G-d does not reward nor punishes people.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“All this,” says Maimonides, “is shameful. It is only necessary because of the immature nature of people who need bribes. They make the ultimate goal of study something other than the study itself.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then quotes Antigonos (who also felt that no one should expect\npayment), and Midrash Sifre commentary on Deuteronomy 11:13:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Should a person say: I will study Torah so that I will become wealthy... so that I will be called ‘rabbi,’... so that I will receive payment in the world to come. Behold, it is written: ‘to love your God.’ Everything that you do, do only out of love.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>True, the Decalogue promises a reward of a long life for the observance, but it is for the masses who need to be told how to act by morality. Rather than accept the usual approach, the Rambam felt that the \"Garden of Eden\" story was a parable which taught a person how to act properly. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, Shemoneh Perakim, he agreed with the Greek pagan Aristotle, that one should act accordingly and restrain themselves from excess in order to follow the middle path or, as commonly called by Maimonides, the Golden Mean. This path avoids extremes and promotes proper habits. Rambam sees the Tree of \"good and evil\" in the parable not as a distinction from right and wrong but from truth and falsehood. Meaning, that people should evaluate every situation, determine the best course of action, and act intelligently, not morally because morality is only a set of rules for the general public who needs to be told how to act in any given situation, but is by no means conventional. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, Lev 26:3-13, Lev 26:14-45, Lev. R. 27:1, are related. They are related in which they promise little in hopes of stimulating the general public to act without promises of reward. Simply stated, a good person prefers good acts because it is the right thing to do and avoids evil because it is wrong. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides felt that people should develop their intellect to learn what is truthful. Of course, Maimonides was careful to permit the masses to believe in the immature notions if it helped them psychologically. But the ultimate reward is for those who seek the truth and study its content. Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz adored Maimonides so much so, that he repeated his teachings in almost all of his books. Indeed, the first paragraph of the shema, Deuteronomy 5:4–9, reflects this rational approach, while the second paragraph, Deuteronomy 11:13–21, promises rewards for the masses, who otherwise, would be promoted to abandon the mitzvah, G-d, and His Torah altogether. </p>\n\n<p>[1] Genetics, disease, drugs and diet can all effect an embryo, and are scientifically proven.

Most people that I know, including I, use a bamboo mat and lay some planks of wood on top to secure it down.</p>\n\n<p>Someone in my shul asked if the mat may be laid down in a \"wavy\" fashion. For example, let's say one lays bamboo poles on top of the succah in a fashion such that some poles are under the schach mat supporting the weight of the mat underneath, while other poles are on top of the schach mat securing it down against the wind. Thus, when viewing the mat from the top of the succah, it is not completely flat but you would see parts over a pole and parts under it like a \"wave\" pattern. Is this OK?</p>\n\n<p>The answer below does seem to address that as long as there are distinguishable walls, this arrangement is fine. However, I am curious if there's any concern for using a \"mixed schach arrangement\" like this. I.e., some bamboo poles are used for \"support\" (the ones under the mat) and some used on top of the mat (which, I guess, would be considered the \"roof\" or actual \"schach\". So, one possible concern is - if the supporting poles are considered halachically \"schach\". Why does this matter? Let's say a wind blew off the mat with the poles on top of it but the poles that were underneath that had supported the mat stayed there. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.19b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Mishnah and Gemarah (Succah 19b)</a> discuss a case of a succah that doesn't have a flat roof:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מתני׳ העושה סוכתו כמין צריף או שסמכה לכותל ר' אליעזר פוסל מפני שאין לה גג וחכמים מכשירין</p>\n  \n  <p>MISHNA: <strong>One who establishes his sukka like a type of circular hut,\n  with no roof whose walls slope down from the center</strong> or who rested the\n  sukka against the wall, by taking long branches and placing one end on\n  the ground and leaning the other end against the wall to establish a\n  structure with no roof, Rabbi Eliezer deems it unfit because it does\n  not have a roof, and the Rabbis deem it fit; as, in their opinion, the\n  roof and the walls may be a single entity, indistinguishable from each\n  other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemarah there explains that if there would be a discernible wall then even Rabbi Eliezer would agree that it is kosher.

Adam means man because he was the first person to have a soul (or in Hebrew שפנ), the neshama. That is not to say that Adam was the first Homo sapiens. Adam and Eve had a mother and a father like you and me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides and Nahmanides say</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Maimonides in The Guide for the Perplexed (part 1 chapter 7) explains that ainamls co-existed with Adam; identical in shape and remarkably intelligent, but lacked the neshama. This made these people animals, respectfully. Seven centuries before Darwin, cave men (pre-Adam hominids) walked with Adam. Genesis 1:26, G-d says “Let us make Adam.” In the following verse, G-d creates “the Adam,” the Adam, a new kind of man [a nuance in the text]. This nuance does not exist in the English translation of the text; only in Hebrew. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Mishna mentions “masters of the field” and explains that these \"masters\" were not people; but animals identical to humans, which implies farming and cultivating the land that pre-dates the Adam of Genesis. Now you have agriculture pre-dating Adam? </p>\n\n<p>Nahmanides a kabalistic commentator discuss Genesis 2:7, explaining that Adam became a man when G-d infused the soul into his body. The Ramban calls this change, “another kind of man.”[1] What is this change?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does the Bible mention this change?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. Genesis 2:7 reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The L-rd G-d formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a nefesh chayah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Onkelos does not render this simply as “a living being,” but characterizes this as man's ruach m’mal’la, “one with the power of speech,” a phrase denoting a certain level of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about the Cave men?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although people have been farming for thousands of years, Adam was the first person with actual intelligence. Maybe an inventor of some sort. Cain, his son would go on to build a city.[2] Now you have civisilation. The problem lies in the mistakable term of Cave men. The wrong assumption lies in the \"men,\" they were not men until G-d gave Adam a soul. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The future?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If scientists someday generate new human bioelectronic species (machine-like) in the form of terminators, it will not pose a threat. Robots have no emotion and are not afraid of death. Therefore, the robot is deprived of its soul. They are intelligent and thus may not be animals, but will lack consciousness. Adam was given a soul, in addition to everything else that machines could not have, despite the superiority of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>[1] It is noteworthy to mention here that G-d made only one kind of man, not two. After Adam G-d never made a \"new kind\" of man. Thus, Jews and non-Jews share the same soul.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Historians have noted that little farming communities existed for thousands of years and that people could have been on this earth for millions; but cities did not appear until about 5,000 years ago, the time of the creation of Adam in the Bible.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The premise behind this question is questionable.

    "content": "# Reference to future Kings of Edomites in Breishit 36:31\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been looking for an authentic Jewish approach to the question of the unique instance of the highly specific future reference in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.36.31?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 36:31</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואלה המלכים אשר מלכו בארץ אדום לפני מלך־מלך לבני ישראל<br>\n  These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but I can only find Christian commentators. Are there Jewish sources that discuss this issue (e.g. did the Jewish people know the future Edomite kings before they came to power, why are there no other similarly specific references to the future in the Chumash, is the text authentic or addition, etc.). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.36.31.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> on the verse notes that some say this verse was written prophetically.</p>\n\n<p>He also quotes, and forcefully dismisses, the opinion of Yitzhaki that this verse was written in the days of Yehoshaphat.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, he himself believes that in truth the king referred to here is none other than Moshe, such that the verse is not a future reference at all but is rather listing the Edomite kings who reigned before Moshe's time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Similar to the Ibn Ezra's view brought by @JoelK, Rabbi Alexander Hool wrote in an article titled \"Who Was The Pharaoh of Yetzias Mitzrayim?\", published in Ami's Double Pesach Issue, and which I surmise is a condensed version of his book \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1946351962\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharaoh: Biblical History, Egypt and the Missing Millennium</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When Yaakov came back from Charan to live with his father Yitzchak in Chevron, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.36.6-7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the verse</a> says that there wasn't enough pasture for the flocks of both Yaakov and Esav, so Esav left with his family. Intriguingly, it doesn't divulge where he went, mentioning only later that he went to Har Se'ir. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.36.9-10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pasuk</a> also specifies that the chieftains of Odah and Bosmas lived in the land of Edom, but doesn't do so with regard to the chieftains of his third wife, Oholivamah.</p>\n<p>From excavations at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaris\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avaris</a>, we now know that just around this time there was an influx of Canaanites to the north of Egypt, an area rich in pasture that is close to Chevron. They prospered there for several centuries, turning Avaris into one of the largest cities in the ancient world. Archeologists have also found a sculpture from that period of a red-haired Canaanite wearing a multicolored coat [I think it's <a href=\"https://www.ancientworldmagazine.com/articles/displaying-identity-statue-levantine-man-tell-el-daba/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one]</a>, reminiscent of the red-haired Esav wearing the coat of many colors that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.115.1?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Midrash says he took from Nimrod</a>.</p>\n<p>What seems to have happened is that Esav moved first to Avaris and sometime afterwards left for Se'ir, later to be called Edom, leaving behind the family of Oholivamah. This might have been a tactical move, as Oholivamah was the granddaughter of Se'ir, whose people, the Chori, Esav went on to destroy (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.2.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 2:12</a>). Had they gone with Esav, they might have sided with the Chori. What this means is that throughout Bnei Yisrael's sojourn in Egypt they were actually living side-by-side with the descendants of Esav in neighboring Avaris. Indeed, Chazal tell us the people who lived in the same region as Bnei Yisrael were much worse than those in the rest of Egypt. We now know why. They weren't Egyptian but Edomites from Canaan whose behavior was repulsive.</p>\n<p>Now let's go back to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Dynasty_of_Egypt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sixth Dynasty</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyksos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hyksos</a> rulers.</p>\n<p>According to the ancient historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Manetho</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teti\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teti</a>, the first of the Sixth Dynasty rulers, was not an Egyptian...Why would a Hyksos king set up his capital there [in Avaris]...unless he himself was an Edomite?\nThis may be what the Torah is alluding to at the end of Parshas Vayishlach. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.36.31-39?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The pasuk</a> lists eight kings that ruled in Edom \"before the reign of the king over Bnei Yisrael\"...in light of the above, we can now suggest that it might also be alluding to the other kings of Esav, who ruled over Bnei Yisrael in Egypt. Accordingly, Teti would have been the first of the Dynasty of Edomites who ruled over the north of Egypt, and it was he who started the subjugation of Bnei Yisrael...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Easiest interpretation is it was written in the time of Moses, either referring to Moses himself serving as a king of sorts, or even more simply -- <em>while the Jews still hadn't yet obtained any monarchy.</em> The whole point is that Esau has chosen himself a shortcut through history without the whole messy difficulty-and-destiny thing. Consequently, while the Jews were just barely out of Egypt, and hadn't yet even had one king, Esau's folks had quite a few.</p>\n\n\n",

Plato (c. 427–347 b.c.e.), attempts to give us a definition of a human being and what makes us human. Plato, a student of Socrates (469–399 b.c.e.), (father of the Socratic method), believed in the almost mystical but nonsensical theory of forms. Plato felt that everything was a copy; a copy of the ideal. Thus, for example, a table is only a table because there is a perfect table in heaven. Without this perfect table elsewhere, the ideal of beauty, they would be no table. Scholars cannot determine where the ideal resides. Is it in heaven or in the mind? Plato doesn't seem to know.</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle (384–322 b.c.e.) disagreed with his teacher Plato. He rejected the amorphous theory of ideals. He focused more on how to live your life properly.</p>\n\n<p>Aristotle was an empiricist. He only accepted what is rational and scientific, observable facts. He was attentive to careful observation, extensive experience, and scientific findings. He would, for example, reject virgin births. Aristotle felt that everything in this world has a purpose. If the object in question achieved its functional use, it achieved its purpose. A chair's purpose is to provide comfortability. Thus the chair has purpose. Humans, too, have a purpose. Its what distinguishes us from animals. A good person is one who acts morally. An excellent person is one who thinks. Maimonides (1138-1204) agrees with this way of thinking. A good Jew is one who practices halacha, Jewish law. An excellent Jew is one who develops their intellect. Because the Torah mitzvot are a means to an end, they help people acquire a proper understanding to improve themselves and society, the goals of the Torah. But the laws are not dispensable. They will continue to be observed in the messianic era. The messianic era will not be a time in a changed in nature. Rather, Jews will live peacefully in Israel and governments will provide the opportunity for philosophizing. Maimonides emphasized the acquisition of knowledge and the use of the scientific method. </p>\n\n<p>The Platonic person looks at a painting, admires it, but does not take notice of its beauty. An intelligent person (or Aristotelian) marvels at the painting, take notice of it and puts its beauty in the form of application. They analyze the work and try to understand why it is good and how it fits in with the others. Thus, while Plato sees a “pie in the\nsky,” Aristotle takes the pie in hand, savors it and eats it.</p>\n\n<p>This rational view was considered heresy to the Dominican heresy-hunters of Montpellier, France. They burned the Greek pagan books before they started burning the Guide. The ideas of metaphysics and the books in which it was contained had no value in Christianity, but it did in the Arabic world where Jews and Arabs existed together for many centries until 1492 when Jews were exiled. Needless to say, Solomon b. Abraham, David b. Saul, and Rabbi Jonah Gerundi were the perpetrators for burning the Guide in Europe. It would not be revealed again for about 200 years until after Moses Mendelssohn has provided it for the general public. Thus, the Chanukah story is not about the Maccabee revolt against Hellenistic paganism, Greek culture. It was a rebellion against the Syrian Greek, who banned circumcision, erected a pagan statue in the Temple and banned Torah study. It was a theological battle, not a rebellion against Greek philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the bible say about being human</strong></p>\n\n<p>Genesis 2:7 reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The L-rd G-d formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a nefesh chayah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Onkelos does not render this simply as “a living being,” but characterizes this as man's ruach m’mal’la, “one with the power of speech,” a phrase denoting a certain level of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to Aristotle and his philosophical disciple Maimonides, a person who focuses his time in contemplative study, neglect to improve themselves or society, refraining from proper habits in the avoidance of the joys of this world in extream isolation (neglecting the Golden Mean) are not religious and certainly not pious – nor can they be called appropriately human. Aristotle defined what it means to be human. To be human is to develop the intellect. It is what separates us from animals. To do otherwise would be almost not human, or to put it differently, it would be less than human. </p>\n\n\n",

The attitude which looks on our\n  relationship to Hashem and the godly, \"religion\", as it is called, as\n  something which also belongs to our affairs, something which is not to\n  be entirely left out, and so we can devote just the \"spare moments of\n  life\" to it, and give \"the lame and the sick, and whatever else is\n  useless\" to it. וניבו נבזה אכלו is how Malachi describes it. \"All that\n  the Altar gets is food which is otherwise despised. It is that\n  allegiance which is only brought by fear, which supports temple and\n  church in the same spirit as it builds hospitals and prisons.</p>\n  \n  <p>But Abel took מבכורות צאנו ומחלביהן, took some of the firstlings of\n  his flock, and of those the very best. He who brings the first and the\n  best, places his relationship to Hashem and the godly in the\n  foreground, for him this relationship is the first and most important,\n  to which all the rest of his life is only accessory; more, offering\n  the \"first\" is always taken in the Torah as representative dedication\n  of all the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, Rav Hirsch points out that Cain was, as the bchor (first born), the representative of the family and his sacrifice was supposed to represent the entire family. Thus Abel was not originally supposed to have to bring a sacrifice at all. It was only because Cain did not bring a <em>proper</em> sacrifice that Abel felt compelled to later bring his own.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So here too we should have expected that Abel would have been included\n  and represented in Cain's offering and that there would have been no\n  occasion for him to bring a separate one. But if in spite of that it\n  is stressed that Abel גם הוא, he also brought an offering, then either\n  Abel did not feel himself represented in Cain's offering, or Cain,\n  caught up in his egoism, did not want to include him also. From what\n  follows the first supposition seems more likely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I don't mean to answer every question you post, but the content is intriguing, so you could see that as a compliment if you like. I will make this a short answer for that reason. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam contradicts himself in the Guide. Is it because of Athens vs Jerusalem or, is it secrets, an esoteric Maimonides? Must we know the secrets to life in order to live a good, properly moral, decent life? It appears that they are many contradictions in the Tnanch and in our own life. Perhaps part of the answer can be found in Rabbi Ishmael's statement dibra torahk’lashon b’nei adam. He felt that “The Torah speaks in the language of people.” Since Rabbi Ishmael felt that “the Torah [which is intended for humans] speaks in human language,\" it follows that the Torah is filled with repetitions for clarity, it is often flowery or poetic and full of symbolism.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva takes the opposite approach and claims that each letter of the Torah bears some kind of significance. Because the Torah is perfect, nothing can be superfluous. Everything is explicit and has a lesson to be learned. Rashi tries to contend with the apparent contradictions found in the Torah using the Akivian method. </p>\n\n<p>Could it be that there is a strong urge to remove contradictions in the Torah because we have a wrong assumption about G-d and His Torah? For example, do we keep the mitzvot because G-d commanded it or is it as Rambam said because the Torah helps improve the individual and society? If we do it for G-d, does G-d change? Does G-d have emotions? Is this a contradiction? </p>\n\n<p>In the first chapter of his Mishneh Torah, the Rambam wrote that since G-d does not speak the Torah is a great human achievement but nonetheless a human achievement. But it is still divine. </p>\n\n<p>It was written by divine inspiration. Moshe wrote the whole Torah by studying G-d’s word written in nature. G-d, who is divine, created the divine laws of nature. Since the Torah copied these divine laws, G-d’s laws, the Torah is divine. A mdirash says that Abraham discovered G-d by studying the heavens and G-d came to him. There's another midrash which states that G-d looked into the Torah and created the world. Could it be fliped in this scenario? That Moshe looked into nature and produced the Torah? </p>\n\n<p>Are you bothered if the event was natural? How does this make you feel? Revelation. What exactly is “revelation”? Does G-d speak? Is it possible that a person can hear G-d’s voice? If G-d did not speak, was it inspiration or insight—but nevertheless an act he was uncertain about. If it was G-d’s voice as the Bible implies, was it a small still voice as with Elijah or was it fiery thunder as with the people at Sinai? If this is the case, does contradiction really matter? Maybe we think in clarity when we are confused?</p>\n\n\n",

Let's first look at the actual wording of Rashi's comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' יצחק לא היה צריך להתחיל התורה אלא מהחדש הזה לכם  שהיא מצוה ראשונה שנצטוו ישראל</p>\n<p>R. Isaac said: The Torah need not have started but from \"this month is for you...\" which is the first commandment <strong>that was commanded [to] Israel</strong>.</p>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the Da'as Zekeinim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקשה שהרי כבר נצטוו על מילה וגיד הנשה ומיהו י\"ל דנקט מצוה ראשונה שנצטוו כל ישראל ביחד ולא ליחיד</p>\n<p>And this is difficult, for <strong>they were already commanded</strong> about circumcision and the sciatic nerve. However, we could say that he chose the first commandment <strong>that all of Israel was commanded together rather than [commanded] to an individual</strong>.</p>\n<p>(My emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"they\" in the question must be a reference to whoever Rashi was talking about. As we saw above that is \"Israel\". Thus, the question here is specifically that \"hachodesh hazeh lachem...\" was not the first commandment given <strong>to Israel</strong>, as circumcision and the sciatic nerve had already been given to Israel (through Abraham and Jacob). The answer is that although those had already been given to Israel, they had only been given to the individual progenitors of Israel but not to the nation of Israel as a whole. The commandment to reproduce – if there is one – doesn't enter the equation, as that was given to all of mankind, and is not something unique to Israel.</p>\n<p>This can perhaps be supported by looking at other <em>rishonim</em> who raise this question:</p>\n<p><strong>Chizkuni</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם תאמר הרי שבע מצות ומילה וגיד הנשה קדמו למצות החדש</p>\n<p>And one can ask that there are the seven [Noahide] commandments, circumcision, and the sciatic nerve which preceded the commandment of \"the month\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tur</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' יצחק לא היה צריך להתחיל התור' אלא מהחדש הזה לכם שהיא מצוה ראשונ' שנתנה לישראל אע\"ג דאיכא ז' מצות שנצטוו לבני נח ומילה לאברהם מ\"מ לכל ישראל לא נצטוו ואכתי לא נפקי מכלל בני נח</p>\n<p>R. Isaac said: the Torah need not have started but from \"this month is for you...\" which is the first commandment that was given to Israel. Even though there are the seven commandments that were commanded to Noahides, and circumcision [that was commanded] to Abraham, nevertheless they weren't commanded to all of Israel and they hadn't yet left the category of Noahides.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In both of these formulations we see that commandments that were given to all of mankind are listed separately from those commanded to the progenitors of Israel. The difference in questions just seems to be that the Da'as Zekeinim only wondered why the Torah didn't start from the first Jewish commandment, while the others wondered why it didn't start from the first human commandment.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, too, you will\n  find that in the case of the ten generations from Adam to Noah it\n  states “So-and-so begat so-and-so”, but when it reaches Noah it deals\n  with him at length. Similarly, of the ten generations from Noah to\n  Abraham it gives but a brief account, but when it comes to Abraham it\n  speaks of him more fully.

It's still clear that the main focus of the Torah is on Avraham and his descendants without as much of a focus on the earlier generations.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the beginning of his commentary to Genesis Chapter Four, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> enumerates four reasons for the Torah's protracted genealogical/biographical discussions. The first one directly addresses your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הראשונה לישב לנו אמונת החדוש וכבר זכרה הרב המורה וזה כי מפני שספרה לנו התורה שהעולם מחודש ושהנברא ממנו ראשונה הוא איש אחד לבד יפול ספק חזק לאנשים על זה המאמר בראותם בישוב אומות רבות מתחלפות מלאו את הארץ ולשונותיהם חלוקים ויחשבו מפני זה שיהיה מה שהגידה התורה מזה כזב כי האנשים אשר הם מאיש אחד ראוי שידברו בלשון מולידם וימשך לזה שלא יהיה נמצא כי אם לשון אחד [לבד] אם הענין כמו שסופר בתורה ר\"ל שיהיו כל האנשים בני איש אחד כל שכן שיהיה זה יותר רחוק להאמין שישלם זה בכמו זה הזמן המועט אשר היה בין בריאת עולם ובין מתן תורה וכאשר ספרה לנו התורה איך הסתעפו האומות המתחלפות מאדם הראשון ומה היתה הסבה אשר הביאה להחלק הלשונות הוסר זה הספק עם שבזה האופן מהתישבת זאת האמונה בלבנו ר\"ל אמונת החדוש כי כשהוגדו לנו אלו התולדות איך היו ושמות הנולדים ומספר חייהם עד שנמשך הענין עד הדור שנתנה לו התורה  התישבה בלבנו יותר זאת האמונה</p>\n  \n  <p>The first one is to instill in us the belief in creation, and Maimonides has already mentioned this. And this is because since the Torah tells us that the world was created, and that originally only one man was created from it, a strong doubt would befall people about this statement when they see many different nations inhabiting and filling the world with different languages. They will think on account of this that that which the Torah tells about this is false, since people that are from one man should all speak the language of their birth. Thus, if the facts are as the Torah says – namely that all people are the descendants of one man – the result should be that there would be only one language. And it would certainly be even more far-fetched to believe that all this occurred in the very short time between the creation of the world and the giving of the Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now when the Torah tells us how all the different nations branched out from from Adam, and what the cause was for the differentiation of languages, this doubt is removed. It also settles this belief in our hearts, i.e. belief in creation. For when [the Torah] tells us these generations – what the names of those born were and the length of their lives – until it extends all the way to the generation that was given the Torah, this belief will become more settled in our hearts.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also my answers <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/80222/is-there-an-underlying-logic-to-the-selection-of-detail-in-the-torah/99770#99770\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/32007/why-does-the-torah-give-us-exact-dates-for-the-flood/95727#95727\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29921/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-genealogy-of-genesis-417-22/99170#99170\">here</a> for more from Ralbag about this general topic.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the explanation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>, mentioned by Ralbag above:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 3:50</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every narrative in the Law serves a certain purpose in connexion with religious teaching. It either helps to establish a principle of faith, or to regulate our actions, and to prevent wrong and injustice among men; and I will show this in each case.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is one of the fundamental principles of the Law that the Universe has been created ex nihilo, and that of the human race, one individual being, Adam, was created. As the time which elapsed from Adam to Moses was not more than about two thousand five hundred years, people would have doubted the truth of that statement if no other information had been added, seeing that the human race was spread over all parts of the earth in different families and with different languages, very unlike the one to the other. In order to remove this doubt the Law gives the genealogy of the nations (Gen. v. and x.), and the manner how they branched off from a common root. It names those of them who were well known, and tells who their fathers were, how long and where they lived. It describes also the cause that led to the dispersion of men over all parts of the earth, and to the formation of their different languages, after they had lived for a long time in one place, and spoken one language (ibid. xi.), as would be natural for descendants of one person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp186.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

And he didn't begin to learn these chachmos (chochmas yevanis) until he had already learned and mastered kol haTorah kula, as the Rivash writes in teshuva 45:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין להביא ראי' מהרמב\"ם ז\"ל כי הוא למד קודם לכן כל התורה כולה בשלמות הלכות ואגדות תוספת' ספרא וספרי וכולי' תלמודא בבלי וירושלמי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be worth your while to read the whole teshuva, because he talks about this topic (the study of chochmas yevanis, lit. Greek Wisdom, and the Rambam's relationship with it) and what some of the Rishonim held about the study of it (as well as what it is exactly, ע\"ש).</p>\n<p>The only time that anyone knocks the Rambam (so far as I'm aware) for truly \"messing up\" a Torah idea is in Yoreh De'ah siman 179 sif 6 where the Gr\"a goes to town on him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No record exists as to explain how Maimonides learned all that he knew about medicine in general and Aristotle in particular. He might not even have had a formal medical education. All that we can know from him is from his own statements, where we learn he was an avid reader. He notes that whenever he studied a subject, he would delve into it and learn all there is to know about the topic. Perhaps this method of learning and Aristotle's teaching drove him to stress the need to acquire knowledge. We know that at a very young age, he learned the rudiments of Judaism under the care of his father where he studied extensively. In addition, he taught himself many secular subjects, even those from non-Jews. Maimon ben Joseph was a student to Joseph ibn Migash (1077–1141) but as far as we know, Maimonides was only taught by his father.[1]</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UCLA Professor Herbert A. Davidson analyzed Rambam's work and concluded that Maimonides did not incorporate the work of his favorite philosopher Aristotle until much later. He represents various periods of his life, reflecting his view that Rambam's opinion changed over time. In addition, Rabbi Goodman said in an interview that Rambam wrote the articles of faith in his twenties and the Moreh Nevukhim in his fifties, implying that the Rambam may have not adhered to all of his principles. This is because Rambam implemented the use of \"Necessary beliefs,\" Aristotle's method, but no official consensus has been reached.</p>\n\n<p>[1] Some claimed Maimonides was also a student of Migash, thereby claiming him to be a part of the long distinguished legacy but this would be impossible since Maimonides was about three years old when Migash died.</p>\n\n\n",

Avoiding the exact question of what that means (a much broader discussion), it clearly is extending some sort of greatness and  \"Godliness\" to mankind.\nIn fact, Rav Hirsch comments that the name אדם \"Adam\" comes from the term הדום, a footstool. Mankind is created to be the footstool of Hashem, a resting place for Him in this world. Man's purpose is to make this world a G-dly world.</p>\n<p>Put this way, the entire first part of the sentence is in fact expressing G-d's vision for mankind.</p>\n<p>So what is the function of the rest of the verse? G-d is establishing a hierarchy among the creation. The pinnacle of all creation will be Man, who will rule over everything which came before it. Rav Hirsch points out that the whole world supports mankind, who in turn \"supports\" G-d in this world. (He says that the word אדמה, land, really means לאדם, for Man, since a ה at the end of a word can equal a ל at the beginning.)</p>\n<p>(This fits well with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.26?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>'s comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וירדו בדגת הים. יֵשׁ בַּלָּשׁוֹן הַזֶּה לְשׁוֹן רִדּוּי וּלְשׁוֹן\nיְרִידָה; זָכָה, רוֹדֶה בַחַיּוֹת וּבַבְּהֵמוֹת, לֹא זָכָה, נַעֲשֶׂה\nיָרוּד לִפְנֵיהֶם וְהַחַיָּה מוֹשֶׁלֶת בּוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The term וירדו can imply either dominance or descendance. If Mankind merits it, we will dominate over the rest of creation. That means that we will be able to utilize everything to the fullest extent, to help us accomplish our role of being the Divine footstools. The second part of the verse will come true when we are living up to the first part.</p>\n<p>If we don't live up to our task, then we will be subdued and controlled by the animals. We  won't merit to be Divine footstools, so we won't be able to control and utilize the world either.</p>\n<p>According to this, the verse reads very precisely.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you've missed something somewhere. You said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would expect God to reveal something far nobler, like \"and he will\nbring this world to perfection\" or \"and he will serve Me devotedly and\nmake a dwelling for me on Earth\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My response is that God said exactly that, but not in as straightforward a way. This is how I read the verse:</p>\n<p><em>Let us make man in our image</em> - the image of God, holy, benevolent, loving to all creatures/creations, just, a leader worthy of praise and full of compassion.</p>\n<p><em>And they shall rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle, the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on earth.</em> - and they (humans) shall rule my creations like I would, for in My image was man made, and they shall rule the animals like I would: Through holiness, benevolence, loving to all, just, and a leader worthy of praise. Just like God would never cheat, murder, eat, steal, abuse, lie to, manipulate any of his creations, He expected the same from us. I don't know if it would be a perfect utopia, but it would certainly be closer to a utopia than what we have now.</p>\n<p>And just like creating a utopia seems like an impossibly high bar, it seems to me God's expectations of us were no less lofty. Imagine how difficult it would be to rule the world as a reflection/emissary of God's image on earth. We didn't even make it to Chapter 3 before we failed. We failed because we allowed ourselves to be tempted by one of our citizens (the serpent), we failed because instead of admitting our mistakes and trying to set things right like a holy and just leader, we fled and hid in a cave hoping our mistakes would never come to light. We failed because we accepted no responsibility even when confronted by our creator. We failed because within a few generations we were murdering our brothers and eating our citizens that were entrusted to us by God Himself.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that when one reads the verses the way I've shown that the point of Maimonides becomes more clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide, III, 13, p. 452</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It should not be believed that all things exist for the sake of the\nexistence of man. On the contrary, all <em><strong>other beings</strong></em> too have been\nintended for their own sakes and not for the sake of something else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All <em><strong>other beings</strong></em> were created for their own sake, but not mankind. Because God didn't need to create man, God could have ruled the earth on His own. But He decided to create man and entrust the responsibility of Earth and all life within it to us. God created everything else for its own sake, but He created us with a responsibility. And until we recognize that the Earth isn't here for our sake, but rather that we are here for the Earth's sake, things will only get worse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Taking your question as a given, I'd suggest that וירדו, the \"ruling\", is the second part of the process. The assertion that man will \"rule\" over the earth is not simply a description of what man will occasionally do. It is a declaration of man's very essence - man is <strong>never</strong> passively shaped by his environment, he <strong>always</strong> has an active role to play in the interaction.</p>\n<p>And since every action we do, every choice we make, affects who we are and who we will become - why then, through this relationship of \"ruling\", we are continually developing ourselves - continuing the \"making\" that G-d began in the first part of the verse. Think of the famous mussar vort, where G-d says \"let US make man\", because man is a partner to his own \"making\", through his actions (עשייה being more of a \"refining\", as opposed to בריאה creating and יצירה forming).</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that נעשה can just as easily be translated as a prediction and ירדו can just as easily be translated as a command. So it naturally flows from there that נעשה and ירדו are just two stages of a single process.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why no Torah or wisdom or knowledge is mentioned presented by G-d to Adam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>IIRC, the passing of the Tora/wisdom/divine knowledge in our tradition didn't start with Moses or even Abraham. Allegedly, the 19 generations of Tzadikim from Adam to Abraham studied/dealt with it passing the tradition over.</p>\n\n<p>It appears, according to Judaism, that <strong>studying the Torah (whatever it is) and keeping the laws is the goal of the whole creation</strong>, and I'd expect the main sourcebook to focus on the existence and cultivation of that knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>However, what we see in the plain text is that the only piece of the divine knowledge/Torah in the form of a Mitzvah/blessing explicitly passed on Adam is \"be fruitful and multiply\". (*I'm aware that the Gemmorah <em>tries</em> to find hints on Adam receiving the 7 Laws but the associations are very distant.*)</p>\n\n<p>But instead, all G-d's interactions with Adam that are mentioned are very \"Earthy\" - \"rule the animal kingdom\", \"take care of the garden\", \"multiply and don't eat fruits\", \"who told you you're naked\", etc. Even when he's expelled G-d outlines his future physical suffering but no mentioning of studying, knowing or the like.</p>\n\n<p>While I don't refute the existence of the Oral tradition, I see <strong>a need to justify</strong> the fact of omitting such important detail from the story. </p>\n\n<p>So, assuming that studying Torah by men is the goal of the Creation, why the Torah does not mention any wisdom passed to Adam from Heaven?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Genesis 26:5 states that G-d said that Abraham \"listened to my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws\", the Talmud and Midrash Genesis Rabba says that Abraham observed all the biblical and rabbinical commands. The rabbis here are emphasizing not only the importance of the Oral Torah (or, Oral Law), but that the Torah and rabbinic laws are part of nature, natural laws, something an intelligent man such as Abraham could deduce from nature. Indeed the Rambam quotes a midrash which says that Abraham discovered G-d by studying the heavens, natural law. </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, G-d revealed to Abraham and gave the option of observing the mitzvot and all the laws of Judaism to the patriarchs who could choose to observe them fully, partially, or none at all; it was optional. They did it to show love of G-d. Additionally, mystics claim that Adam observed the Torah and the wisdom of the Kabbalah. But if this were so, why did Cain kill Abel and Eve eat the fruit? Perhaps Adam was away or that the 7 laws of Noah did not exist yet. Could this be the reason why the Torah is silent on the matter?</p>\n\n\n",

The soul is objecting to sin. Once she gets down here though, she is taught about teshuva<sup>4</sup>, and that a baal teshuva stands where no other man can stand<sup>5</sup>, and she realises she has nothing to be scared of she is happy to say.</p>\n<p>That's the point of view of our eternal soul. Now, where does she reside? In the body of, effectively, a very developed animal<sup>6</sup>. Specifically, the soul of that animal, which has a yeitzer hara. The yeitzer hara is like a trap, that locks the eternal soul into the body, aligning things with the will of the creator<sup>7</sup>.</p>\n<p>The soul is forced to enjoy this lowly world, because its yeitzer hara stirs it to, and it goes 13 years totally under the rule of the yeitzer hara<sup>8</sup>. In those golden years, the soul sees the world exactly how Hashem sees it. Beautiful, exciting, a place to make a <em>dira betachton</em>, and have gan eden in it. This beautiful love of life, which is initially taught to the soul by the animal soul, and yeitzer hara, is what keeps this eternal soul in the body, otherwise she would flee, because she is too scared of sin<sup>9</sup>, and distance from Hashem, and would rather not be born, as we said. The animal soul has its own in-built mechanisms, and one of them is the burning desire to survive, and not die<sup>10</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>So, there are 2 answers to your question:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Our animal soul, and its yeitzer hara, make us instinctively want to object to your logical suggestion of Olam Haba.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Our eternal soul eventually comes to appreciate the value of being here, serving Hashem, and would much rather do that, than focus on her \"Olam Haba\", and is glad to finally have shaken off the bread of shame.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

David said: “I will pursue my enemies and overtake them…” (Psalms 18:38). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so.’ That is what is written: “David smote them from twilight until the evening of their next day” (I Samuel 30:17). What is “of their next day”? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: For two nights and one day. The Holy One blessed be He would illuminate for him with comets and lightning, as we learned there: Over comets, over earthquakes, and over lightning. That is what is written: “For you will illuminate my lamp…” (Psalms 18:29).</p>\n<p>Asa arose and said: ‘I do not have the power to kill them, but I will pursue them and You do [the killing].’ He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “Asa…pursued them…as they were broken before the Lord and before His camp; they carried a great many spoils” (II Chronicles 14:12). “Before Asa” is not written here, but rather, “before the Lord and before His camp.”</p>\n<p>Yehoshafat arose and said: ‘I have the power neither to kill nor to pursue; rather, I will recite song and You do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “At the time that they began with song and praise, [the Lord set ambushes against the children of Amon, Moav, and the highlands of Se'ir]” (II Chronicles 20:22).</p>\n<p>Hezekiah arose and said: ‘I have the power neither to kill, nor to pursue, nor to recite song; rather I will sleep in my bed and You do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will do so,’ as it is stated: “It was on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians” (II Kings 19:35).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The difference between David and Hezekiah is that David put significantly many more efforts into his accomplishments. Perhaps, because of it, David was able to compose many <em>Shiros</em> and Tehilim, but Hezekiah did not, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.94a.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 94a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The attribute of justice said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, and if with regard to David, king of Israel, who recited several songs and praises before You, You did not designate him as the Messiah, then with regard to Hezekiah, for whom You performed all these miracles, delivering him from Sennacherib and healing his illness, and he did not recite praise before You, will You designate him as the Messiah? It is for that reason that the mem was closed, because there was an opportunity for redemption that was thwarted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from historical consequences, we see from these sources that David <em>hamelekh</em> has a much higher ranking in Shamaim because he accomplished more.</p>\n<p>A person who chooses life in this world is also chooses to accomplish more, even though he may fail in his attempts. Why is this important? Because of the ability to learn to sing the <em>shirah</em> of grattitude i.e. be fully appreciative of the other side (Hashem, people). One can say that quantitatively, both David and Hezekiah received the same reward (even if in this world) but because David put an effort to earn it, he was able to sing. Perhaps, so will be the shame in the World to Come for those who receive reward without putting any effort as they will not be able to sing. But those, who put an effort, will be able to sing.</p>\n\n\n",

There are many answers, but let's focus on this one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bet is the beginning of the word <em>barukh</em> (blessed), but aleph is the beginning of the word <em>arur</em> (cursed).  [Chagigah Y 2:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem is that there are many nice words that begin with aleph (<em>ahavah</em>, or love; <em>achvah</em>, or brotherhood), and many negative words that begin with bet (<em>bechiah</em>, or crying).  </p>\n\n<p>You would think that if you are going to use a certain method of explanation, you should use it always, not selectively.  Picking and choosing where to apply it can lead you to any pre-ordained conclusion, and does not make a compelling argument.</p>\n\n<p>Is this addressed anywhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Maharal (Sanhedrin 97b) explains that you’ve got it backwards: beis isn’t auspicious because it is the first letter in “beracha”; the word “beracha” is auspicious because it begins with a beis (and inversely for aleph and arur). Beis has a Gematria of two, symbolizing plurality and increasing, so it’s appropriate that it be the first letter of the word beracha; likewise, aleph has a Gematria of one, symbolizing stagnancy, an appropriate beginning to the word arur. </p>\n\n<p>The Torah begins with the letter beis not because it’s the first letter in the word beracha, but rather the letter beis itself represents the concept of beracha. It doesn’t begin with the letter aleph not because it’s the first letter in the word arur, but rather because the letter aleph itself represents the concept of arur. </p>\n\n\n",

The Torah has things to say on this as well. R Akiva Tatz writes (in his <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1568711751\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thinking Jewish Teenager's Guide to Life</a>) that, to find one's vocation, a person should think about his strengths (what he knows really well), his passions (what he loves to do) and what the world needs (and ready to pay for). At the intersection of the three he will find his unique role in life and unique contribution to the world.</p>\n\n<p>R David Lapin expands on this (in his <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0068S0U6M\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lead By Greatness</a>) and provides a very actionable approach for someone to discover his strengths, capabilities, passions, spiritual values and how they correlate with possible future careers.</p>\n\n<p>So there is plenty of positive to focus on and time for a restart if you feel like it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>There is nothing that does not come from G-d - even evil has a kernel of good. This is why evil is referred to as a <em>klipah</em>, a shell - it separates holiness from G-d but the holiness is still there, buried within.</p>\n\n<p>While it is not advisable to deliberately pursue a sinful life for the sake of \"redeeming\" it later, once it is already done, there <em>is</em> always a way to redeem it. Instead of seeing your youth as being \"wasted\", figure out a way to <em>use</em> what you have learned through your experiences to improve yourself spiritually and improve the world around you.</p>\n\n<p>The most straightforward way of doing this is helping others who are going through similar situations. This is advisable for one who has experienced the worst evils (drugs, abuse, etc.) provided one can avoid backsliding. A period of separation may be necessary to ensure that you are no longer drawn into it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>For mundane matters that are neither holy nor evil, it is often possible to use them to come to deeper understandings later once one has a solid backing of Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Generally, the smaller / shorter you can keep the flame and the shorter the flame stays lit, the safer things are. (I don't understand why most Shabbat wax candles stay lit for 4 hours, and some, as much as 6 hours. Do we need them on that long?)</p>\n\n<p>If you're going to use the liquid paraffin as you have described, I highly recommend the enclosed <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0057H787E\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ner Mitvah holders</a> which has the wick inside a glass container with a small bit of the wick hanging out. This eliminates the floating wick, and there's o drippy mess anywhere either. Additionally, you can control the fuel level so that you can have the candles burn, say one hour. (I think that's enough, but ask a rav what the minimum should be.)</p>\n\n\n",

He adds that it is preferred for them to remain lit until nightfall if that is later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאם אוכל בבית אף שאין דולקת עד הלילה סגי ולא הוי ברכה לבטלה שאף שעדיין יום יש לו הנאה ושמחה בשעת אכילה מן הנרות. ומצוה מן המובחר שיעשה נרות ארוכות שיהיו דולקות עד הלילה אף שרוצה לאכול מבעוד יום</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the criterion for fulfilling the mitzvah minimally is deriving some benefit and enjoyment from the candles, either by having them enhance your meal or by benefiting from their light after nightfall. So if you are going out for the meal they should last at least until you come home and benefit from them. The Mishna Brurah adds in the next s.k. that if it was a bit dark when you lighted and you used the light to prepare for the seudah, that is enough to avoid a blessing in vain, so if you are going out for a while but eating at home later, you may want to consider that.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are a number of similar sounding questions to the one you posed which can be confusing, so while <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/109326/759\">Alex's answer</a> is indeed correct, it's helpful to understand the different issues so you can understand why some sources might \"seem\" to disagree. Here's the background:</p>\n\n<p>The rabbinic command of kindling lights on Friday evening is to have enough lights for all your needs that night when you can't kindle new lights and, for purposes of household harmony, need to be able to see so you don't trip on or bump into things. So if your question is \"what does one need to do\" it's that. Everyone agrees to this.</p>\n\n<p>The question dealt with in classic works is what happens if \"as much as you need at night\" is actually zero? Consider people who, living at extreme latitudes, would begin Shabbat early and go to sleep before dark in the summer. They would kindle lights for the duration of their meals and then go to sleep. Some Rishonim held that since the lights were never actually used to help see things (as you can already see everything in the daylight), any blessing on those lights was in vain since they don't accomplish any commandment. Other Rishonim held that since the lights add to the atmosphere of the evening meal or since they help a little bit with seeing things as it gets close to nightfall, the lights do accomplish the rabbinic command by serving your needs and thus the blessing recited on them was valid.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%92_%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 263:9</a>) seemingly rules leniently, but Maharil (who is quoted in Matteh Moshe (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42401&st=&pgnum=111\" rel=\"noreferrer\">421</a>), who is quoted in Magen Avraham (263 sk 16), who is quoted in Mishna Berura (263 sk 40) that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/109245/759\">Jay cited</a>) recommended being strict and staying up past nightfall with the lights so as to remove any doubt about the need to light them. This is all irrelevant though if you'll be staying up till dark anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have your basic answer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kindle lights for as long as you plan to need them.\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you'll be changing locations at night, you must have lights in the new location too for however long you plan to be there.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If you aren't going to use a particular light on Shabbat, don't recite a blessing when kindling it.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not everyone thinks that use before darkness qualifies, so if you weren't planning on being up past dark, some recommend doing so anyway.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your question is minimally upon kindling what lights can one say the blessing, the answer is any light which will be used for some of your needs that night. In that sense, a light provides minimal fulfillment if you use it even a bit. Everyone agrees to this. (If you have more needs than the one light can fulfill though, don't forget that you will still need to kindle other lights too.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The final twist here is the modern phenomenon of electric lighting where we certainly depart from \"everyone agrees to this\" territory, so I'll just give you an example of one way to structure the issue.</p>\n\n<p>For nearly everyone today, electric lighting already ensures you won't trip on anything at home and will be able to see and enjoy your dinner. Indeed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/36466/759\">many authorities allow using your electric lights to fulfill this obligation</a> (and for the opinion that doesn't, then our situation is no different from the classical situation above where you have sufficient ambient non-candle light, and you can stop reading here).</p>\n\n<p>According to those authorities who allow using electric lights, if you're anyway going to light candles too to add a distinguished character to the evening meal or do something extra to actively demonstrate intent to care about Shabbat, that's a great way to honor Shabbat, but there'd seemingly be no strict requirement for those candles to last any longer than you want (if you have sufficient electric lighting in place anyway to see) since they are essentially extra credit.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to say the blessing on kindling that bonus candle (instead of the electric lighting which serves as the primary vehicle for your fulfillment of the commandment) be sure the candle lasts long enough to at least serve some of your needs on Friday night, subject to the dispute above regarding if that can take place before darkness.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have your modern answer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Turn on all relevant electric lights (don't forget the lights in the bathroom!)\n\n<ul>\n<li>For extra credit light candles to create an honorable atmosphere and do something noticeably special for Shabbat (or because you want to be strict for the opinion that electric lights don't count).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If you aren't going to use a particular candle or light later on (subject to the above dispute about nightfall), don't recite your blessing when kindling or turning on that one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=54963&st=&pgnum=81\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Ohr Yitzchak 2:108</a>) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Abadi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yitzchak Abadi</a> writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שיש מדקדקים להדליק נרות ולהשתמש לאורם מיד או לאחר קצת זמן כדי שלא תהא ברכתם לבטלה הם טועים  בדין דהנה מצות הדלקה היא כדי שיוכל להשתמש לאור הנר כל הזמן שצריך לו ואין זה כהדלקת נר חנוכה שקבעו לה זמן וכבתה אין זקוק לה  אלא בנר שבת הוא חייב שיהא דולק כל זמן שאפשר שיצטרך לו בלילה והוא פשוט והעולם לא נזהרים בזה</p>\n<p>And that which they are fastidious to light candles and use their light immediately or after a bit of time in order that their blessing should not be in vain, they are erring in the law. For the commandment of lighting is in order to be able to use the light of the candle as long as it is needed. This is not like the Hanukkah candle where they set a time, and if it gets extinguished he is not bound to it; by the Sabbath candle he is obligated that it be lit as long as he might need it at night. And this is obvious, yet the world is not careful about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See for example the references in the Tanya in Igeret HaTeshuvah at <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49432&st=&pgnum=183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the end of chapter 1</a> to Sefer Rokeach and Mishnat Chassidim and also in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49432&st=&pgnum=185\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 3</a> there.</p>\n<p>Medically speaking, water fasting, meaning abstinence from eating, is something that can be done for many, many days consecutively. <em>The world record for fasting is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Barbieri%27s_fast\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">over a year</a>.</em> However, a dry fast (abstinence from both eating and drinking) can only be survived for three to five days. The abstinence from water is the critical factor.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the Torah make a distinction between types of fasts?</strong> The Aramaic word for <em>fast</em> is תענית from the Hebrew ענה. The Hebrew root has a connotation of <em>to respond</em> or <em>to answer</em> (as in answering for improper actions) and also <em>to deprive</em>, or <em>to delay</em>, or <em>to submit/become humble</em> or <em>to become poor</em>. All of these relate to the idea of depriving oneself of food in humility and an act of submission to G-d's will.</p>\n<p>The consequence being that one burns their excess body fat, which is compared to burning the fat of an offering on the altar brought in the Temple, like is mentioned in the Tanya for example.</p>\n<p>So the focus seems to be about the burning of body fat, which relates to the eating of food only.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pAzJz.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Yona in Sod Hateshuva brings an inyan about what's become referred to as \"taanis HaRaavad\" which is to refrain from a little bit of eating.</p>\n<p>I couldn't find it online so I attached a picture. I don't think it's exactly what you were looking for, but it's close.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If I understand the question correctly, you are asking if there is a concept of fasting from food without refraining from water in Torah.</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that a צום could be refraining only from food but allowing water.  In Ester 5:16 and Yona 3:5-7 not eating and not drinking are specified, which would seem to imply that there could be a tzom not like that. Also in Shmuel II chapter 12, Dovid is tzome, and only food is mentioned, not drink.</p>\n\n<p>This is not conclusive; please don't complain about that.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did Adam and Chava know what's good or bad before eating from the tree?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Hashem Elohim allowed the human being to eat the product which was produced by every tree in Gan Eden, except from the tree of knowledge (understanding) of what’s good and bad. So with this knowledge human knew of which trees one could eat and of which tree one couldn’t eat; they should have known that it would be a transgression of the command (i.e. a sin) if they indeed ate from it.</p>\n\n<p>But without the knowledge of what’s good and what’s bad, produced by this one tree, <strong>how could Adam and Chavah have known it was ‘bad’ to eat from it’s fruit, and ‘good’ not to eat from it? How could they have been able to make a discernment between good and bad, make a judgement?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One more thing, Hashem seems to have made everything He created ‘good’ and even ‘very good’. If the human being had only experienced good – and witnessed, experienced or practiced nothing with which to contrast good – up until the point they sinned and their eyes were opened, how would the human being have ever been able to inherently know it would be bad to eat from the fruit of this one tree?</p>\n\n<p>How could the human being have known what would be proper and fitting? How could they have known it was the right thing to listen and obey G-d’s voice, and wrong to follow their own voice (i.e. the snake)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -4)\n\n<p><strong>The problem you see is wrong assumptions!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since G-d does not emit evil it is inconceivable to image that G-d would produce or create \"dark forces\" such as Satan or malevolent talking serpents (snakes) to manipulate or distort the creation of the world in which the Bible calls \"Very good.\"</p>\n\n<p>The \"Garden of Eden\" story is about morality and intelligence, and the duty and obligation to develop one's intelligence. The Rambam felt that the Garden of Eden parable taught a person how to live life correctly because the Torah is certainly holy, he felt that no other book - and I agree with him - tells a man how to live life correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam sees the Tree of \"good and evil\" in the parable not as a distinction from right and wrong but from truth and falsehood. Meaning, that people should evaluate every situation, determine the best course of action, and act intelligently, not morally because morality is only a set of rules for the general public who needs to be told how to act in any given situation, but is by no means conventional.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Confusing Gzeilah and Gneivah in the Gemara (Bava Qama 96b)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I wonder if someone can help me with a gemara question? I’m revising the ninth perek of Bava Qama and on 96b the gemara explains a passage in the mishna in a way that strikes me as totally incongruous.</p>\n\n<p>The mishna says, “זה הכלל כל הגזלנין משלמין כשעת הגזילה”: \"This is the rule: all robbers must repay the stolen item as it was at the moment of robbery\". The gemara asks what “זה כלל” is coming to include, and resolves that it’s including the case of a person who stole an infant animal, which grew up and became an adult while they owned it. As a result, they are not subject to the <em>din</em> of ארבעה וחמשה since they technically ‘acquired’ the animal with this <em>shinui</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is, the <em>din</em> of ארבעה וחמשה applies exclusively to <em>theft</em>, not robbery. Until now, all we’ve been speaking about in this entire perek is robbery (<em>gezeilah</em>). This whole mishna, in its entirety, is about <em>gezeilah</em>. Even this line explicitly refers to <em>gazlanim</em>! Why would the gemara now take it as referring to a case of theft (<em>geneivah</em>), such that we can apply the din of ארבעה וחמשה, which is inapplicable to robbery (<em>gezeilah</em>)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does animal soul (Nefesh) come from the divine or the material?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>[I assume] it is wildly accepted in Judaism that animals have souls (hence \"anima\"). In Hebrew, it is called נפש (Nefesh) and the Torah is full of this kind of references:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וּֽלְכׇל־חַיַּ֣ת הָ֠אָרֶץ וּלְכׇל־עֹ֨וף הַשָּׁמַ֜יִם וּלְכֹ֣ל רֹומֵ֣שׂ עַל־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־בֹּו֙ נֶ֣פֶשׁ חַיָּ֔ה אֶת־כׇּל־יֶ֥רֶק עֵ֖שֶׂב לְאׇכְלָ֑ה וַֽיְהִי־כֵֽן׃\"<br />\n\"וְכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִקְרָא־לֹ֧ו הָֽאָדָ֛ם נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּ֖ה ה֥וּא שְׁמֹֽו׃\", etc</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process of the creation of Adam is clearly two-fold: the creation of the material body and the infusion of the soul:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיִּיצֶר֩ ה\"א אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֗ם עָפָר֙ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה<br />\nוַיִּפַּ֥ח בְּאַפָּ֖יו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים<br />\n<strong>וַֽיְהִ֥י הָֽאָדָ֖ם לְנֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה׃</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are all familiar with the notion that the human soul is \"חלק אלוק ממעל\" (a part of the divine) (Job 31,2). However, contrary to the Man, the infusion of [any type of] soul is not mentioned with the animals:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיִּצֶר ה\"א מִן־הָאֲדָמָה כָּל־חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה וְאֵת כָּל־עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is: where does the animal soul (Nefesh), which comprises the instincts, social and intelligent behaviors, come from - from the divine, in the process omitted in the Torah, or from the material, as described, being its integral \"feature\"?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Noach the person to save the animals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While reading this week's portion, I was wondering why did Noach have in particular the merit to save the animals of the created world? They could have been saved in other ways, for example the Land of Israel was not flooded according to <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/RabbaGenesis/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n313/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabbah 33:6</a>, but <em>Hashem</em> could have done a miracle or recreated them. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I think it is related to the fact that he was then allowed to eat the animals (after the mabul). If they don't owe man their lives, why would man be allowed to take their lives for his needs?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nI have found this opinion at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ramban_on_Genesis.1.29.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nachmanides on Genesis 1:29</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Belsky had a related question, and his answer will answer your question as well. This is printed in his Einei Yisroel on Torah, but I heard it from him live.</p>\n\n<p>He asked why was Noach the tzadik chosen through which the world was saved? Chazzal imply that Mesushelach and Shem were actually greater tzadikim than Noach. See Sukkah 52b which calls Mesushelach one of the seven Shepherds and Shem ben Noach (according to Rashi there) was one of the four craftsmen mentioned in Zecharia 2:3. Noach was on neither of these lists. So why choose Noach And not one of them?</p>\n\n<p>He answered the following. Hashem decided to destroy the world reasoning that all life was reprehensible. So who can prove that life, gashmius, deserves to exist? Through people who were so perfect that they are practically on the level of angels, pure ruchnios? It wouldn't work. Their greatness was attained by removing themselves from this world, not from being involved in it. They could not prove that the world should survive. Rather a tzadik like Noach, described as a man of the land (9:20) was the perfect representative to prove that physical life deserved to exist.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to your question. The point of Noach, according to this, was not simply to be a vehicle for saving the world. \nHis behaviors and his actual being were part of what was necessary to save the world.</p>\n\n<p>I would add that this approach also helps us understand why we have opinions in drashos going out of the way to point out that Noach was only considered a tzadik in his generation (תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּדֹֽרֹתָ֑יו) and that Noach, unlike Avraham needed support for his righteousness (אֶת־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֖ים הִֽתְהַלֶּךְ־נֹֽחַ). Also his partial disbelief proven by his not going into the Teivah until the water forced him to (מִפְּנֵ֖י מֵ֥י הַמַּבּֽוּל). (See Rashi on all these pesukim). \nNoach's greatness was not in his otherworldly greatness like other tzadikim. His greatness was a different type. The type needed to prove that the world deserves to exist.  All of Noach's imperfect actions up until his ignoble forced exit from the Teivah (הוצא) [הַיְצֵ֣א] 8:17 (see Rashi) and perhaps even his drunken behavior after exiting, are all part of the complicated figure we know as Noach who was able to prove through his imperfect perfection that man and the world deserve to exist. \nAnd as mentioned before, this was more than just being the vehicle for Hashem's decision.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Divorce Agreements and Get Meusa (divorce given under duress)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Today it happens (and my impression is that it is rather common) for a divorcing couple to write a civil divorce agreement with all the conditions of their divorce, and this agreement will contain a clause compelling the husband to actually give the divorce after the agreement is approved by the court. Not giving the divorce after this would carry some pretty severe civil penalties, even if no penalty is specified in the agreement.</p>\n<p>Now, if someone has compelled themselves to give a divorce, they should be released from that commitment before writing the get lest it possibly be considered a get given under duress, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.134.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 134:4</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם נשבע הבעל ליתן גט צריך שיתירו לו קודם שלא יהא דומה לאונס אך ערבות יתן אם ירצה שאין זה דומה לאונס: הגה וה\"ה אם קבל קנין לגרש (פסקי מהרא\"י סימן קע\"ג) אבל אם קבל עליו קנסות אם לא יגרש לא מקרי אונס מאחר דתלה גיטו בדבר אחר ויכול ליתן הקנסות ולא לגרש (ב\"י בשם תשובה וכן הוא במהרי\"ק שם בפסקים) (ויש מחמירין אפי' בכה\"ג שם בתשובת הרשב\"א) וטוב לחוש לכתחילה ולפטרו מן הקנס אבל אם כבר גירש מפני זה ואפי' גירש מכח שבועה שעשה מעצמו לגרש הגט כשר. הואיל ומתחלה לא אנסוהו על כך (תשובת הריטב\"א)</p>\n<p>If the husband takes an oath to give a bill of divorce, they need to make him renounce it beforehand, in order that it not look like he is being compelled. But if it was just a pledge he made, he can give it if he wants, because this is not similar to being compelled. Rem''a: and this is the ruling if he receives an acquisition to divorce. But if he accepts fines if he does not divorce, this is not called compulsion, since his bill of divorce was dependent on another thing and he will be able to give the fine and not divorce. And there are those that are stringent even in a case like that. And it's better to worry a priori and exempt him from the fine. But if he already divorced(her) because of this, and even did so from the strength of the oath he made to divorce, the bill of divorce is kosher, since, from the outset, they did not compel him by this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I understand the practical reasons why this is done, but I do not see how these considerations deal with this halacha. Please don't give answers which just explain the legal and social reality.</p>\n<p>Are divorces given subsequent to such agreements being accepted by a court only kosher bidieved? Is there any psak given in modern times which addresses this?</p>\n\n\n",

Hashem gave us permission, \"the heavens -- the heavens are for G-d, but the land He gave to Adam's descendants.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.115.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 115:16</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Rather, he says the person is stealing from the world the spirituality that could have been brought out by acknowledging the Divine Source of the apple.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar (and Rashi, and the Ritva, and...) say that \"berakhah\" is a term that means increase. By acknowledging the G-dliness inherent in the created thing, we increase the amount that G-dliness is manifest in the world.</p>\n\n<p>And if you see that manifest G-dliness through awareness in terms of a commitment to use that apple's energy to actively bring G-d's Will into the world, you get <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/109325/1570\">R SR Hirsch's explanation described in Saba Hillel's answer</a>.

Using the counts from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/44235/18112\">this answer</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>304,805 letters</li>\n<li>79,975 breaks (79,976 words, each of which except the last one precedes a space, pasuk break, or perek break)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>which is 384780 symbols in total.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the Torah can contain at most log_2(25^384,780) = <strong>1,786,863 bits of information = 218 kB</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This applies <em>no matter</em> what technique is used to extract this information, whether by reading the pshat or searching for codes. Each bit of the Torah controls at most one non-redundant bit of any derived interpretation; to get more, more information must be brought in for outside. This can be done in illegitimate ways (twisting the text for a favoured interpretation) or in legitimate ways (assuming that the Torah assumes that the reader knows obvious things, such as what humans look like, and doesn't spend any time giving a description).</p>\n\n<p>218 kB is certainly not enough for \"the details of every species and every person individually, and the most minute details of his life from the day of his birth until his death\": there are millions of species and billions of people.</p>\n\n<h1>Then what does the statement mean?</h1>\n\n<p>I'm having some difficulty here.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious thought is that \"Torah\" is to be understood as all that is taught (in particular, including the Oral Torah), not as the physical words of the written Torah. Indeed, this is the ordinary meaning of the word. But the quote says \"from 'Bereshit' to 'l'enei kol Yisrael'\", which seems to mean specifically the five books.</p>\n\n<p>The other obvious thought is that the minute details are not mentioned explicitly, but unfold from what is written. For example, I can write a simulation of a ball of gas expanding: it takes very little information to describe the whole system, but much more to pinpoint any particle (by position and velocity) inside the system.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe likewise, the Torah implies the life history of every person, but doesn't stop and say \"this life history belongs to this particular person\". But that seems inconsistent with reports of mentions of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/109327/is-everything-really-in-the-torah#comment366327_109327\">a single individual</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Alternately, some say that the Torah contains not only the physical letters, but also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1254056/jewish/Where-Are-the-600000-Letters-of-the-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hidden spiritual letters</a>. However, the count given is 600,000 letters total (physical and spiritual), which is still very short. Perhaps the Vilna Gaon (and the Ramban?) doesn't hold by that count?</p>\n\n<p>Thus, option (2) in the question looks likely: that \"everything is contained in it\" means at least \"all wisdom\" (and some of this wisdom is also found outside the Torah). If (1) is also true, then it's true in a more complicated sense.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Permissibility of shortening long Brachot for teaching to children\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many children are old enough to learn short <em>brachot</em> (and somewhat understand them, if explained), but don't have the memory/patience for longer <em>brachot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Frustratingly, many of the <em>brachot</em> that could be introduced naturally in a child's routine are long (eg. <em>asher yatzar</em>, <em>ḳiddush</em>, <em>birkat hamazon</em>, <em>aḥat me'ein shalosh</em>). One suggestion could be using (non-Hebrew) alternative phrasing (not a <em>bracha</em>) that expresses the intent of the <em>bracha</em> (eg. \"God makes all food, thank you for the food\" for <em>birkat hamazon</em>). However, one could also teach a child a part of the \"real\" <em>bracha</em> that the child can reasonably learn; one simple option would be the <em>ḥatimot</em> of the long <em>brachot</em> (eg. בא״י הזן את הכל). Teaching part of the \"real\" <em>bracha</em> seems preferable, since the goal is eventually to teach the entire <em>bracha</em>, and if the child learns part of it now, learning the rest later will be easier (and make more sense to them).</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering whether there is discussion as to the permissibility of teaching the <em>ḥatima</em> independently of the rest of the <em>bracha</em>. Short of learning the full <em>bracha</em> all at once, is this a permissible half-way step? Is there any discussion of converting the <em>ḥatima</em> to one with <em>shem</em> and <em>malchut</em> (ie. בא״י אמ״ה) for the purposes of saying an entire short <em>bracha</em>? Might the age of the child matter: older than 6 or 7 (\"<em>ḥinuch</em> age\") versus younger?</p>\n\n<p>A potential source against my suggestion is the rule prohibiting turning a long <em>bracha</em> into a short one (ie. turning בא״י אמ״ה גוף הברכה בא״י חתימה into בא״י אמ״ה חתימה; see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mBrachot 1:4</a> with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Berakhot.1.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tBrachot 1:7</a>). From what I understand, <em>ḥinuch</em> should be as close to the \"real thing\" as possible (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/63862/4940\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/46217/buying-pasul-arba-minim-or-non-arba-minim-for-your-small-child?noredirect=1&lq=1\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/20442/may-a-child-make-a-berachah-on-a-pasul-set-of-4-species?rq=1\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13785/4940\">4</a>, etc.). Thus, I presume that adding <em>shem</em> and <em>malchut</em> to the <em>ḥatimah</em> is impermissible, even for <em>ḥinuch</em>. But perhaps just teaching the <em>ḥatima</em> as a half-way step is not fully making a short <em>bracha</em> out of a long one?</p>\n\n<p>A possible argument for just using the <em>ḥatima</em> is the allowance of the formula \"ברוך (...) מחדש חדשים\" for the unlettered (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.42a.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 42a</a>), instead of the full <em>birkat halevana</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>+1 for a good question, which is part <em>halacha</em> (law), part <em>hashkafa</em> (perspective on children education).

However, when Hashem warned Adam about the tree, he was only told that it is forbidden to eat from the tree. Where did Chavah come up with the idea that touching is also forbidden?</p>\n\n<p>When Adam informed Chavah of the prohibition, he added an additional safeguard to prevent transgression, by saying that even touching is forbidden. \nWhile this ended up backfiring, we see that Adam did indeed share the commandments that were told to him with Chavah.</p>\n\n<p>This is recorded in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D'Rabbi_Natan.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos D'Rabbi Nosson 1:5</a> (only quoting the relevant middle of the Mishnah):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איזהו סייג שעשה אדם הראשון לדבריו הרי הוא אומר (בראשית ב) ויצו ה׳\n  אלהים על האדם [לאמר] מכל עץ הגן אכול תאכל ומעץ הדעת טוב ורע לא תאכל\n  ממנו כי ביום אכלך ממנו מות תמות לא רצה אדם הראשון לומר לחוה כדרך שא״ל\n  הקב״ה אלא כך אמר לה ועשה סייג לדבריו יותר ממה שאמר לו הקב״ה ומפרי העץ\n  אשר בתוך הגן אמר אלהים לא תאכלו ממנו ולא תגעו בו פן תמותון שרצה לשמור\n  את עצמו ואת חוה מן העץ אפילו בנגיעה.</p>\n  \n  <p>What safeguard did First Man make for his words?

They establish the paradigm that is later expressed via the creation of Adam and Chava. The sun shines on the moon, which then reflects the light received from the sun. The moon is a source of <em>reflected light.</em></p>\n\n<p>In the same way, Chava lost her direct memory of G-d's teachings when she was <em>built</em> from Adam HaRishon. At that point, she had to be taught by her husband what was expected of her. That's the main point of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. Chava responded to the Nachash exactly what her husband had taught her. See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=68\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siftei Chachamim to Bereshit 3:2 beginning with the words, \"כיון שהיא ידעה בעצמה כו׳\"</a> for details.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The possibilities are endless. We will go through a few (but of course not all) as to why Adam <em>seemingly</em> did not pass on the commandments. </p>\n\n<p>(1) It is possible, that the Torah or Oral Torah [oral law] did not exist in the time of Adam. The seven Noahide commandments are a rabbinical invention. It is not in the Torah. No court existed in the days of Noah. This could account for Eve and Cain's mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>(2) It is possible, and some think this is so, that the story of Cain is not a true story but a parable. I do not remember Maimonides explicitly saying this, but he did say in Guide 1:2 that the story of the Garden of Eden is a parable. </p>\n\n<p>(3) If the above is not a parable, why is Cain punished for a sin he was told nothing about? Why do we not see Adam and Eve’s reaction to the murder? Is it possible that Cain only meant to hurt his brother but not kill him? Did G-d exile him or did he realize his mistake and left of his own? </p>\n\n<p>(4) Yet another possibility is Kabbalistic. Accordingly, G-d gave [or Adam discovered] the Torah and followed them. But like the person who knowingly passes through a redlight, Eve, Cain, and Noah would have transgressed the law, purposely and intentionally. </p>\n\n<p>(5) There is a Midrash that says that G-d gave the patriarchs the option of keeping [or observeing] the commandments [mitzvots]. They could choose to keep all of them, partially, or none at all. They did so only out of a love of G-d. </p>\n\n<p>(6) The Rambam writes that Abraham did not keep the law. He only knew the philosophic aspects of Judaism. He discovered G-d by studying the heavens but did not observe all of the mitzvot. He later explains that this was the reason why most of the Israelites in Egypt forgot G-d and left for idol worship until Moshe led them out of slavery. He explains this as the reason to keep the mitzvot. If we fail to do the rituals, we may forget the philosophy. This would explain Adam's neglect of the law.</p>\n\n<p>(7) The \"Garden of Eden\" story is a parable and needs no explanation. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding \"conflict\" between Genesis creation and \"continuous\" creation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a passage in the daily Shacharit tefilla in the 1st of the pre-<em>Shema</em> blessing that says:</p>\n\n<p>המחדש בטובו בכל יום תמיד <strong>מעשה בראשית</strong></p>\n\n<p>My translation and inference from this phrase is that God continuously renews his works of creating the world each day, namely a renewal of מעשה בראשית - the initial creation as described in Genesis.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to contradict what I recall from Art Scroll's explanation (I don't recall whom he cited, offhand) that when the Torah uses the term  כי טוב it means that is what \"perfect\" and complete and that it required no further improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Torah says that on the seventh day, God <strong>completed</strong> everything and that He \"rested\" on the seventh day from all the work that He created.</p>\n\n<p>So, if creation was complete and everything was perfect, does the phrase we say in Shacharit contradict this concept of completion. What is meant by \"renewing\" or \"recreating\" things and why does this need to be done, especially if the Torah says that everything was \"complete\" and \"perfect\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Another question one may have, is according to the baal shem tov's explanation on that part of davening, that \"tamid\", constantly, renews the work of creation, is that everything is being created constantly from nothing, not only every day (at the beginning of the day), as is the simple inference from that tefilah</p>\n<p>Another point, for example, is the concept o circumcision, even though Adam was created perfect, like the verse you cited \"Hashem saw everything he has made and behold, it was very good\" which its explained from the Midrash (probably the source the artscroll book cited) that the world was created \"perfect\" (literally \"on its fillings\", \"bimeeloo-oh nivra\"), so how can we have circumcision, for example?</p>\n<p>To answer the last point, its brought in kabbalah books the statement from the Talmud that the earth was created \"to fix\" (\"lisah-kayn\"), as in \"tikun olam\", that even though the world was created perfect in its own way, but through our own efforts, we can reach a higher level of perfection than the original creation intention (for example it says when moshiach comes hashem will create a new heavens and earth, even though this heavens and earth are already perfect, because it will be a new level of perfection \"ayleh toldos peretz\", as opposed to \"ayleh toldos shamayim vaaretz\", even though both of them have two vavs, but one is a deeper level of perfection)</p>\n<p>anyway regarding the first point of re-creation, see tanya volume 2 chapter(s) 1(-5) regarding creation every instant, but another question that's similar, that is brought in kablah books, is how can we call sunday, for example \"hayom yom rishon\", \"today is the first day\" and on monday \"today is the second day\" etc., if there have been many tens of thousands of days in the world, since the original 6 days? Meaning is every sunday really the <em>first</em> day? If not how can we call it the \"first\" day?</p>\n<p>and the answer (don't recall the exact source but its referenced in Torah Ohr and brought in otehr kaballah books) that every week creation happens again just like the first time, such that every sunday is vivified with the same divine energy as the literal \"first\" day of creation, such that every sunday is literally the \"first day\" relative to the new energy that flows through it every week (besides for the world being recreated every second, as referenced in the sources from tanya part 2, in a more general sense it's recreated every week), and more specifically, even every hour, as its explained in many kabbalistic sources (including ramban) that the 24 hours of each day, as well as the first day(s) of creation, represent the 24 different combinations of Hashem's 4 letter name (4! == 24), which happen anew every day as well</p>\n<p>See tanya part 2 as well as the sources there for further elaboration</p>\n\n\n",

From our perspective which is bound by time is where the doubt comes into play, for we don't have a tangible grasp on what our ultimate destiny will be. We are plagued with doubts as to what our task is and if we will fulfill it the right way(Not to mention more primal doubts like God's existence or spirituality, etc.). Our very limited scope of reality causes an inherent agonizing sense of uncertainty that, from a birds-eye view, would dissuade us from wanting to be created.

    "content": "# Were G-d's expectations for Dor Hamabul realistic?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Undoubtfully the all-loving G-d was a bit harsh on punishing the whole generation of Noah (probably millions?) by drowning them (and all the animals - what did they do?) in boiling water (He could simply give them a stroke). But what were they punished for? Here's some background, please let me know if I contradict any Midrashic interpretations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>G-d creates Adam and <em>allegedly</em> commands him the 7 Noahide laws with nothing in written (for those who think only Noah was commanded, this is even a better question). </p></li>\n<li><p>Even when commanded, Adam is not explained the reward for his compliance or the punishment for transgressing them, not mentioning \"the final solution\" for the whole of humanity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Strangely, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/109347\">we see</a> that Adam isn't commanded to pass those commandments and this knowledge on to his descendants or to rebuke the wrongdoers. Neither he's commanded to educate his kids accordingly. Surely he wanders around telling his story, but the only punishment he tells about is downgrading to the Earthy life.</p></li>\n<li><p>G-d gets, probably, seriously hurt by Adam's sin and decides to completely hide Himself from humanity, He doesn't speak with people and doesn't send reliable messengers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Meanwhile, 9 generations of humans are born into total bliss and anarchy, setting their own rules for social conduct and eventually forgetting who G-d is. That angers Him but, instead of intervening, He patiently waits for almost 16 centuries and then suddenly, one day, He reveals to only one man, describes His plan and commands to prepare himself for his personal salvation.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The gloomy rest we all know.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, many years ago, I used to yell at my kids for their misbehavior, but eventually recognized that much of it boils to my misunderstanding or unrealistic expectation, and if I was my kids I would behave pretty similarly.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I'm not judging G-d and He must be <em>by definition</em> just, I'm trying to understand His thinking and reasoning (for it is a Mitzvah to follow His ways) and it's important that He not only be just but He has to <em>look just</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So, how do our interpreters see G-d's justify G-d's expectations from Dor Hamabul?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Men were created with the natural desire to overcome the angel of death. Pretty much all religious beliefs boil down to this simple idea. You are correct that only with Avraham the Torah notes that he was instructing members of his household. Creation of Avraham - is really step #3 in Creation after Step 1 ended with flood and step 2 with the Tower of Bavel. Probably, it became necessary, to instruct the children, because correction of the world no longer became a possibility of one generation.</p>\n<p>Because in previous generations people had a higher capacity to return they also had an easier way to commit <em>aveiros</em>. Not that G-d abandoned them by indicating with natural events of His intentions: for example during the time of Enosh due to service of stars  there was a massive flood. There were also righteous people: Adam, Methishelach, Noach from whose actions and behavior people could learn from. People had long life spans which indicated their great health and mental capabilities to draw good conclusions from the surrounding world. Perhaps, G-d's regret about men in the Torah - it is similar to a parent who put one hope into his or her child, but the nature of the  environment, lack of experience, opened too many other possibilities for them to forget one's fundamental natural desire.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, it is similar to how Moshe learned Torah on Mt. Sinai. Every day Hashem taught him entire Torah and then made him forget. I heard that the purpose of such forgetting was some sort of <em>taharah</em>. I.e. a certain mental guide of what spiritual perfection should be like. Maybe such was the purpose of the flood - to create a mental mark so that people could stay away from destructive behavior. By the way, the generation of Midbar proves it to be the case. Mishna in perek Chelek in Sanhedrin says - they do not have chelek in olam haba (just like the generation of the Flood), but the generation of Midbar started many generations of people who do. Their experience is a lesson for us.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>You are right to ask this question. Why did G-d feel the need to “blot out from the earth the men whom I created—man together with beasts, creeping things, and birds of the sky” (Genesis 6:7)? Could He simply forgive them? Is it possible that every person was corrupted without exceptions? Were the animals also bad even though they were only following their instincts? Why did they need to be killed? Needles to say, the fish survived the flood. Rabbi Arnold Ehrlich felt that the fish should also have been killed since, they too, ate other fish. </p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that the entire world, with the exception of one family, become totally corrupt and required obliteration without the chance to repent? Can it be that the Bible is exaggerating the entire event in order to make a point? Is it possible that the entire world was not flooded, but just a single, local flood, as scientists now suggest? </p>\n\n<p>Is the story of Noah’s flood a myth? Does G-d interact with the world? The Rambam wrote in the first chapter of his Mishneh Torah that G-d does not speak. Does it account for G-d’s silence for nine centuries and even during the holocaust? How does this make you feel if G-d never spoke to anyone. Did Noah act righteously? Did he have too much faith? Did Adam act faithfully when he didn’t inform his children about the law, and why does the Bible not inform us of Adam’s reaction to Cain’s murder, nor are we told if Adam ever disparaged him for his sin. Why?</p>\n\n<p>The Greeks told us in their flood myth that people were saved by throwing stones in order to repopulate the world. This is not natural. The biblical account is more natural. Noah is given additional time to construct an ark and build rooms to accommodate for the animals and his family. Is it possible that Noah was able to accommodate all the animals? Does it make sense that animals who are only habitual to certain areas like the rain forest could live in Noah’s world to begin with?</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam wrote that G-d is good and never commits evil. If this is so, did G-d cause the flood, if ever there was one, or was it a natural event. Why is the flood in the Bible attributed to G-d and not other natural disasters that occur today? </p>\n\n<p>After the flood, G-d regrets ever having made man. Does G-d regrets? If G-d regrets, does this denote that justice was done improperly or does it mean to say something else? That G-d wished creation had turned differently. If the latter is the case, is G-d all-knowing. The Ralbag, as well as Ibn Ezra felt that G-d only knows only the general but not the particular. Ibn Ezra also says that the flood did not last for forty days but was on and off and was intermittent. Perhaps the story is a myth, a parable which teaches a moral lesson.</p>\n\n\n",

Most translate this as Avraham seeing the natural world as so amazing, it's like a fully-lit-up palace that must have an owner. Others, however, say he's looking at the vast structure of human civilization that preceded him, and realizing it is <em>aflame</em> and in serious trouble -- and that Someone must care.

    "content": "# Can a gentile work for a Jew on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a rabbinic decree that a Jew may not ask a gentile, right before Shabbat, to do work for him because he might do it on Shabbat [Gittin 8b].  But in the Mishna [Shabbat 1:8] Hillel allows it, \"as long as the sun is still shining\".  </p>\n\n<p>What was Hillel's reasoning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Gittin 8b The Gemora says a person may not ask a Gentile to <strong>write on Shabbos</strong> (or do any <em>Melacha</em>) except for writing a contract buying land in Israel then and there for fear of losing oppurtunity - כותבין עליו אונו ואפילו בשבת בשבת ס\"ד כדאמר רבא אומר לעובד כוכבים ועושה</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna in Shabbos is specifically talking about asking the Gentile <strong>before Shabbos</strong> to do a <em>Melacha</em> <strong>when he wants</strong> i.e he's not resricted to do the Melacha on Shabbos rather he has time to do it also on sunday if he wants. The Shulchan Aruch Orach chaim 244,1says only discreet jobs which the hirer is not recognized by e.g tanning skins etc. like those mentioned in Shabbos 1,8 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מותר במה דברים אמורים בצנעה שאין מכירים הכל שזו המלאכה הנעשית בשבת של ישראל היא            </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishna Brura Explains (rough translation) that <strong>the Jew must not specifically restrain the Gentile to work on Shabbos</strong> rather give him sunday as well, and if the gentile does it on Shabbos thats for his own convenience.                 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכיון שקצץ אדעתיה דנפשיה קעביד למהר להשלים מלאכתו דלישראל אין קפידא בזה דאם לא יעשהו היום יעשהו למחר דאם קובע לו מלאכתו בשבת אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Noach and crew were only 8, therefore they could not save the world. Clearly, by the standard that G-d was using to judge righteousness, no one else in the world was considered righteous.</p>\n\n<p>This number can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.32?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.18.32.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, Bereishis 18:32</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אולי ימצאון שם עשרה. עַל הַפָּחוּת לֹא בִקֵּשׁ, אָמַר דוֹר הַמַּבּוּל\n  הָיוּ ח', נֹחַ וּבָנָיו וּנְשֵׁיהֶם, וְלֹא הִצִּילוּ עַל דּוֹרָם;\n  וְעַל ט' עַל יְדֵי צֵרוּף כְּבָר בִּקֵּשׁ וְלֹא מָצָא: אולי ימצאון שם\n  עשרה </p>\n  \n  <p>PERADVENTURE THERE SHALL TEN BE FOUND THERE — For a smaller\n  number he did not plead because he knew already of two instances where\n  less than ten had failed to save the wicked.

Before the flood, Hashem made a very similar comment, but arrived at the opposite conclusion (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 6:5</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וירא ה' כי רבה רעת האדם בארץ וכל־יצר מחשבת לבו רק רע כל־היום</p>\n<p>Hashem saw how great was man’s wickedness on earth, and how every plan\ndevised by his mind was nothing but evil all the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result of seeing that man sins all the time, He resolved to destroy man (ibid 6-7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וינחם יהוה כי־עשה את־האדם בארץ ויתעצב אל־לבו</p>\n<p>And Hashem regretted that He had made man on earth, and His heart\nwas saddened.</p>\n<p>ויאמר יהוה אמחה את־האדם אשר־בראתי מעל פני האדמה מאדם עד־בהמה עד־רמש\nועד־עוף השמים כי נחמתי כי עשיתם</p>\n<p>Hashem said, “I will blot out from the earth the men whom I\ncreated—men together with beasts, creeping things, and birds of the\nsky; for I regret that I made them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet after the flood, the logic itself doesn't seem to change, just the conclusion. Even though man is \"evil since his youth\", Hashem resolves to <em>not</em> destroy Him.</p>\n<p><strong>The difference is the pleasing odor.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>What made Hashem change His opinion?</h3>\n<p>Chabad teachings use this as an opportunity to explain something fundamental - pleasure sits at the very top of our existence, meaning it is the strongest motivator. Pleasure is like a fine oil, it seeps and is absorbed into every other part of our being, including our intellect. <strong>If the intellectual conclusion is that man is evil since youth, and Hashem has no pleasure in mankind, then the argument will lean negative, and motivate Hashem to destroy them. However, if man is providing a \"pleasant odor\", then the very same argument will lean positive, and motivate Hashem to preserve and love them.</strong></p>\n<p>It goes from:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no good reason to keep mankind around: they are evil since they are born!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can't expect them to be perfect: they are evil since they are born, afterall</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h3>How is this possible?</h3>\n<p><strong>Does that contradict <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chesed_LeAvraham%2C_Even_Shetiya%2C_Maayan_2.5?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hashem's \"unchanging\" nature</a>?</strong> Not at all. Both our holy <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.53?ven=Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_English_Translation,_Friedlander_(1903)&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Philosophers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Mitzvotekha%2C_The_commandment_of_having_faith_in_God.5.3?lang=he&lookup=%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A9&with=Lexicon&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kabbalists</a> often invoke a very important mashal to explain what this means: Hashem is like a fire. A fire has just one property: heat. However, it produces myriad <em>effects</em>: burning, scalding, blackening, whitening, melting, hardening, scorching, flame, glow. I.e. the different effects are the result of <em>what is applied to the fire</em>, not the fire itself, which is just one (l'havdil).</p>\n<p>So, in this case, Hashem Himself didn't change - what gives Him pleasure, so to speak, never changes. It is up to us to change our selves, and our behaviour, in order to evoke a different decree from Him towards us, and thus we are indeed in a very dynamic relationship with Him. He doesn't change, but we do, and so our relationship evolves towards (or, sometimes, away from, <em>chas veshalom</em>) the perfection that is His very Self.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונח מצא חן בעיני ה׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also Maamar Basi Legani 5710 18</p>\n\n\n",

They were many rabbis who supported and opposed the Rambam's 13 principles of faith. </p>\n\n<p>In his The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides’ Thirteen Principles Reappraised, Rabbi Marc B. Shapiro examines the principals. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to Perek Chelek, Maimonides calls this dogma; whoever rejects these principles loses their share in the World to Come. Menachem Kellner calls the principles the first dogma of Judaism. But some have condemned this as a scare tactic, similar to those used in Christianity (accept Jesus or else). Yet, as we will see, even well-respected Orthodox rabbis rejected his ideas. Some speculate on whether Rambam himself accepted them. We will go through a few (but of course not all). </p>\n\n<p><strong>13 Principles reappraised</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is many responsa literature on the subject. While Maimonides listed 13, Shimon ben Zemah Duran, in his Ohev mishpat and Joseph Albo, in Sefer Ha-ikkarim listed only three. Hasdai Crescas, in Or ha-shem listed only six. David ben Yom Tov ibn Bilia lists twenty-six principles of faith. Don Isaac Abravanel lists 613.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosaphist Rabbi Moses Taku disagreed with Maimonides' first principle. He felt that G-d could do the impossible (create a rock so big that He cannot lift and yet lifts it). He also felt that sometimes G-d can take human form and calls Rambam's position that G-d does not change and is always incorporeal, thus denying that G-d sometimes change is considered heresy. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posquieres (known as Rabad, or Ra’avad,) disagreed with the second and third principles'. Writing, \"There are many people greater and superior to him who adhere to such a belief [that G-d has a body like humans] on the basis of what they have seen in verses of Scripture and even in the words of those aggadot which corrupt right opinion about religious matters.” He also wrote, “greater and better people than Rambam” were corporealists. Comment to Hilchos Teshuvah 3:7. According to Rabbi Slifkin Rashi was a corporealist. You can read that article <a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/Vol7Slifkinwithletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Additionally, Kabbalist believes that G-d is made up of ten parts called Sefirot. </p>\n\n<p>Abraham ibn Ezra rejects the fourth, saying, that G-d created the world out of preexisting matter. Some scholars dispute whether the Rambam might have also felt this way and might have used \"Nessecary beliefs\" to state the opposite if that was not his true conviction. (more on that later). </p>\n\n<p>Some Jews seemingly reject the fifth principle when they pray to angels every Friday night in the Shalom Aleichem, which states: “Bless me for peace, angels of peace.” Others have rationalized it, saying that it's not to be taken literally. Maimonides himself seemingly rejects the sixth principle, stating that prophecy is the result of a higher intellect.</p>\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud seems to disagree with the 7th. Sanhedrin 21b states that Ezra is greater than Moses: “If Moses had not preceded him, Ezra would have been worthy to have the Torah revealed to Israel through him.” The Midrash Genesis Rabbah 14:34 thinks it was Balaam: “What prophet did they [non-Israelites] have who was like Moses? Balaam the son of Beor.” Regarding the 8th, the Masoretic text has changed a few letters, though with minor variations. See the Midrash Numbers Rabbah and Avot d’Rabbi Natan regarding the Masorites placing dots.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the ninth, the Babylonian Talmud, Nidah 61b, Rabbi Joseph says: “The mitzvot [commandments] will be abolished in the time to come.” Rabbi Joseph Albo, in his Sefer Ha-ikkarim) writes that a future prophet can abolish [or, nullify] all of the biblical commands except the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments). Regarding the 10th, ibn Ezra writes in Genesis 18:21, “The whole [G-d] knows the individual in a general manner rather than a detailed manner.” Ralbag writes similarly in Milhamot Hashem, that G-d knows the universal but not the particular. Many think the Rambam disputes reward and punishment in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to Perek Chelek. Rabbi Hillel (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 99a), would reject principle 12, stating that the messiah already came in the days of King Hezekiah. Regarding the 13th, Rabad writes in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to Perek Chelek and Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuvah 8: “There is no resurrection for bodies, but only for souls.” Whether or not bodies resurrect spiritually or physically, all agree that Maimonides wrote that after the messianic age no bodies exist, only intellects. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Necessary beliefs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some scholars think Maimonides himself did not believe in all of his principles, only the first few that talks about G-d. Some scholars have pointed to a concept called \"Necessary beliefs.\" Spinoza, as well as many Arab philosophers, such as Averroes,  used this tradition called Plato's Noble Lie. It was sometimes used to keep civilization in check, to tell untruths or essential beliefs because the masses couldn't grasp deeper philosophy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>In short, many well-respected rabbis accepted or reject these views. Shapiro stresses in his book that what matters more is behavior. He puts emphasis on action over beliefs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think Maimonides accepted <em>all</em> of his principles. These [above] are only some of the views proposed by Rabbi Marc B. Shapiro in his book The Limits of Orthodox Theology. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did animals need to eat/be fed for a year in the Ark?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why did animals need to eat/be fed for a year in the Ark?</p>\n\n<p>\"Oh, because they need to eat\", you'd say, but really the <em>Mabul</em> was one big miracle, overriding all laws of nature - physics, geology, zoology, biology, genetics and whatnot.</p>\n\n<p>Why in this huge miracle did animals need to eat? This problem was easily \"circumvented\" for the Israelites in the desert with Mannah. This \"natural behavior\" actually caused more additional miracles to be performed - miraculous preparing of the food for all animals, miraculous feeding, taking care of poop etc.</p>\n\n<p>Why couldn't G-d simply stop them from eating for a year? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>R Ari Wasserman explains the ark was a \"<em>chesed</em> school\" and that feeding animals became the mechanism to teach Noah and his family a value which would be fundamental to the new world being created.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As Chazal tell us, feeding all these creatures was a full-time,\n  round-the clock job, as some were nocturnal, some ate more often than\n  others, etc. <strong>Noach and co.’s constant giving was part of Hashem’s\n  rehab program for humanity.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>As Rabbi Mordechai Gifter explains, Hashem created the world solely to\n  bestow chesed and to enable man to do likewise. But Noach’s generation\n  couldn’t manage it. Either people rejected chesed altogether,\n  committing violent crimes, or – along with the animals – they\n  perverted this precious value by engaging in forbidden relationships.\n  Their inability to live in harmony destroyed the world. <strong>To rebuild it,\n  humankind had to become humankind, mastering chesed anew.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>That’s what Noach and his family did aboard the ark. <strong>Aside from\n  protecting them from the flood, this craft served as a floating chesed\n  academy in which they learned to work together and give unstintingly.</strong>\n  Only after “graduation” were they permitted to exit the ark and embark\n  on the sacred task of reconstructing the world. (Pirkei Torah, parshas\n  Noach)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why couldn't G-d simply stop them from eating for a year?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because it was all part of G-ds plan, in recreating a perfect species.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk, also known as the Meshech Chochmah, writes that the reason why the animals that were inside the ark were fed, is because it was part of G-ds \"rehabilitation\" programme. Animals also acted sinfully during the generation of the flood, so they needed to be \"re-schooled\" so to say.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meshekh_Chokhmah%2C_Noakh.12?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshech Chochmah</a> explains that by feeding the animals, they would learn (re-learn) faithfulness (part of explanation below).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובגמרא פרק חלק למשפחותיהם יצאו אמר ר' יוחנן ולא הם והענין דהמבול היה שוהה שנים עשר חודש (עיין עדיות משפט דור המבול י\"ב חודש) אף שכל ענין המבול היה שלא ע\"ד הסדור הטבעי, וקיום נח והבעלי חיים היו בענין השגחה מיוחדת להתקיים באויר כזה אשר היה משחית ומכלה ולזה אמר ויזכור אלקים את נח ואת כל אשר אתו בתבה פירוש בעוד היותם בתבה זכר אותם בהשגחה מדויקת וכן דרשו בב\"ר מה זכירה נזכר לו שזן ופרנס אותם כל י\"ב חודש שבתבה וא\"כ היה ביכולת ההשגחה למחות כל היקום כרגע אולם כי השחית כל בשר את דרכו על הארץ [לבד מה שלא השחיתו במקרה] ונשחת תכונת הבע\"ח לגמרי וטבעם היה לאהוב הרע והחמס ולזה היה צריך חנוך י\"ב חודש ולהיות נעצרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also this wonderful article, written by <a href=\"https://dafdigest.org/masechtos/Sanhedrin%20108.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf Yomi Digest on Sanhedrin 108</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During these twelve months the animals themselves refrained from procreating, became accustomed to minimal rations, were fed by man and would once again fear him.  After this reinitiation they could leave and remain eternally faithful to their families and no longer mate with other species. This is what Rav Yochanan meant when he said that “they left to their families and not they themselves,” as the animals had undergone such a drastic change in their behavior and nature that the original group which entered were now truly different animals than those which had entered the ark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I take issue with your premise. I'm not a fan of endless explanations of miracles, because I think it makes theology and philosophy lazy. I take a similar issue with Christians inserting Jesus into every Angelic or Miraculous event in the Hebrew Bible. They are using \"miracles\" or divine intervention to explain things in the Bible that don't need to be explained that way.</p>\n<p>As far as I'm aware, the ONLY Miraculous thing that happens in the mabul/flood is God creates rain, and opens up the floodgates of the Earth and the water covers the land. The Bible is really clear on this part.</p>\n<p>The Bible doesn't make clear about any other miracles, but we assume them to make sense of the story in our current understanding. The idea that the animals would come on their own, in pairs and families without a human to lead them sounds miraculous. The idea they'd live peacefully in an ark for a year and not each other sounds miraculous. The fact that Noah and the animals would eat the same food sounds miraculous. Or Noah sending off birds who come and report back can sound miraculous.</p>\n<p>But the Bible doesn't describe these events as truly outside the norm. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/115467/9045\">And I argue that this is the case because the Bible considers animals to both be sentient AND talking until the Tower of Babel.</a> If we accept this Biblical premise, then suddenly the prior paragraph has zero miracles. Not only that it helps explains why God felt He was able to make a covenant with Noah AND all the animals that came off the ark. Because God isn't usually known for making covenants with creatures that can't understand the terms of the deal.</p>\n\n\n",

Samaritans (population fewer than 1000) use a P-H abjad derivative, known as the Samaritan alphabet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So maybe, was it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aramaic script</a> \"The ancient Aramaic alphabet was adapted from the Phoenician alphabet and became a distinct script by the 8th century BC. It was used to write the Aramaic language and had displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, itself a derivative of the Phoenician alphabet, for the writing of Hebrew.\"?</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia also says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The earliest inscriptions in the Aramaic language use the Phoenician alphabet.[2] Over time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. Aramaic gradually became the lingua franca throughout the Middle East, with the script at first complementing and then displacing Assyrian cuneiform, as the predominant writing system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I'm a little confused. It seems to go, in terms of <em>script</em>. Phoenician -> Paleo-Hebrew -> (Hebrew, Samaritan, Aramaic). Something like that. So Hebrew script, what did it evolve from? Was it Aramaic, Phoenician, or Paleo-Hebrew? I'm assuming it was directly from Paleo-Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>So this would mean the font should be Paleo Hebrew. Wikipedia also says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By the 5th century BCE (with the Hebrew Jews exiled in the diaspora) P-H was subsumed by the Imperial Aramaic abjad with little remnant -- the Aramaic sharing a common protolanguage with a simpler font.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not sure what it would've been for certain though.</p>\n\n<p>Or could all of the scripts been written in \"<a href=\"https://www.ancient-hebrew.org/learn/how-to-type-in-hebrew.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Early Semitic</a>\", with pictographs? At least the Torah? Or could it have been Phoenician? It seems Paleo-Hebrew and Phoenician look pretty much exactly the same. Even if we dont have any of it recorded in history, do you think the Torah would've been written down in Phoenician, or Aramaic, or Proto Hebrew?</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Hebrew_alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to one Jewish tradition,[6] however, the block script seen today in Hebrew Torah Scrolls, known as Kthav Ashurith, was the original Hebrew script carved into the Ten Commandments.[7] According to this opinion, the Ktav Ashurith was lost over time, as the masses used Paleo-Hebrew and its cousins, known as Kthav Ivri, for day to day writing, just as Jews today use a non block script for everyday writing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Would a Torah in <a href=\"http://ancientroadpublications.com/Fonts.html#ProtoSinaitic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proto Sinaitic</a> have ever existed?</p>\n\n<p>As of my research, it seems either it was Proto Sinaitic or Phoenician which are the earliest candidates for first capturing the Torah. Also, <a href=\"https://github.com/aharonium/fonts/tree/master/Fonts/Hebrew%20Letters%20only/Culmus%20Project%20(GPL%20and%20GPL%2BFE)/Yoram%20Gnat%20(GPL%2BFE)/Ancient-Semitic-Scripts-0.06-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> is a collection of Hebrew-related ancient fonts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ancient-hebrew.org/ancient-alphabet/paleo-hebrew-alphabet.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> site says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Prior to the Babylonian captivity, the Jews used an alphabet very similar to what is found in the Torah scrolls of the Samaritans. However, during the Babylonian captivity, the Jews adopted the Aramaic square script. While paleo-Hebrew continued to be used by the Jews into the first century A.D. on a limited basis, it was the Aramaic square script that was most predominately used to write Hebrew and this is the script used in most scrolls found in the Dead Sea caves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Not a single one of them would turn to the Creator of\n  the universe and realise that He, and He alone, is the Creator of the\n  entire universe. On the other hand, the opposite will occur if discord\n  will break out among them regarding the supremacy of any of the\n  deities versus the competing ones. In such a scenario, every nation\n  would believe that there is one deity that is superior to all the\n  various national deities, whose concern is only with the particular\n  nation worshipping that deity. All the minor deities would have to\n  subordinate themselves to the power of that super-deity. The prophet\n  Maleachi 1,11 expresses this in the following words: ”for from where\n  the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honoured among the\n  nations;” כי ממזרח שמש ועד מבואו גדול שמי בגוים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.11.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains this as a sort of rhetorical question being asked by G-d.

Nimrod and his people wanted to build a tower\n  that would reach up to heaven, so that they might establish their\n  reign upon the heaven as well as on the earth. It was the height of\n  arrogance and defiance of men against G‑d, and it led to confusion and\n  to their dispersal and division into seventy tongues and nations.\n  Abraham decided that it was high time for him to go out and teach them\n  the truth about G‑d, and about the falsehood and worthlessness of the\n  idols. He knew that in defying Nimrod, and even his own father, he\n  would be risking his life, for Nimrod had proclaimed himself god and\n  demanded that all the people worship him.</p>\n  \n  <p>At the age of fifty (in the year 1998) Abraham returned to his\n  father's house in Babylon</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112063/jewish/Abrahams-Early-Life.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112063/jewish/Abrahams-Early-Life.htm</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

The end of the Horachamon that I refer to is worded \"ours and all that is ours\". But this ending  sometimes does not agree in number with the beginning of the sentence which can read “me and all that is mine\" or “head of household”. <p>\nSo the sentence can read like this, “May the merciful one bless me, all that is mine, ours and all that is ours.” But that makes no sense to me.  If the end of the sentence should agree with the beginning of the sentence, why do bentchers not include a singular wording of the end of the sentence?

One eating alone who is not blessing anyone else, such as family members, would skip the words אותנו וכל אשר לנו.</p>\n<p>Let us point out that the text (נוסח) of all berachos is largely fluid (but <strong>CYLOR before making any changes</strong>, because the essential parts can be very subtle), especially with the HaRachmans after the forth blessing. To quote the Abudraham:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואומר הרחמן כל אחד ואחד כרצונו וכרצון שאלתו</p>\n<p>And say HaRachaman, each as he wishes to ask (from G-d).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Talmud requires a guest to add a blessing for his host in his blessings after the meal. While it provides a suggested text, old prayer booklets, especially Ashkenazi ones, include a different blessing which consistently appears with some minor variations as:</p>\n\n<p>הרחמן הוא יברך את [אבי] מארי בעל הבית הזה ואת [אמי] מרתי בעלת הבית הזה ואת ביתם ואת זרעם ואת כל אשר להם ואותנו ואת כל אשר לנו כמו שנתברכו אבותינו אברהם יצחק ויעקב בכל מכל כל כן יברך אותנו כלנו יחד בברכה שלמה אמן במרום ילמדו עליהם ועלינו זכות שתא לנו למשמרת שלום ונשא ברכה מאת ה' וצדקה מאלדי ישענו ונמצא חן ושכל טוב בעיני אלדים ואדם</p>\n\n<p>If you are the host, then you obviously aren't included in that requirement (ShuA 201:1).</p>\n\n<p>If you are moved to say a blessing for yourself or your own family or the Yankees, feel free to say one.

The Birnbaum siddur seems to have the same trouble with that approach as I.

To address your question: text is justified right and left; paragraphs are denoted by spaces, from the end of the paragraph either until the end of the line or for a short gap; there is no page numbering (nor, for that matter, verse or other numbering) included; there are several columns of text per sheet of parchment. (Oh, did I mention it's handwritten on parchment? It is. And the sheets are not bound in a stack but sewn end to end to make a long scroll.) There are occasional departures from this layout for poetry, where the text is laid out more… poetically. (Actually, \"Torah scroll\" refers to the scroll of the first five books of the bible. We also have similar scrolls of other books of the bible — but not nowadays of any other books — and the layout is <em>basically</em> the same.)</p>\n\n<p>Other books, including other copies of the Torah, have no such rules and you can find all sorts of formats. Really all sorts: some break it up by chapter or other man-devised paragraph system; some have no paragraph breaks at all; some have just a few words per line with translation on the side; some have just a few words per <em>page</em> with commentary; I've seen bible text written in tiny letters in various directions, arranged to form a shape; you name it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Does G-d punish the innocent?",
    "content": "# Does G-d punish the innocent?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Almost every law in the Torah commands proper action aside from the first few in the Ten commandments about G-d's and His oneness. In his book, Kosher Jesus, Chapt. 28, pg 163, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach writes, \"It is inhumane to hold someone accountable for the sins of another. Judaism believes in a just G-d that holds people responsible as individuals and doesn't punish them for their ancestors' sin.\"</p>\n\n<p>He then quotes Deuteronomy, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Ezekiel, G-d declares:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"He will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live... Yet you ask, 'Why does the son not share the guilt of the father?' Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all My decrees, he will surely live. The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shmuley later writes, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Judaism is predicated on the belief that each of us is born neither good nor bad, but innocent. Judaism holds all are born innocent, all are accountable to G-d for their behavior — no excuses. We have a conscience, We will be judged by one thing and one thing alone: our actions. G-d, it turns out, is just.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the chapter, he was arguing against original sin. But we could apply his reasoning to my question. Does G-d punish people for generations and kills innocent babies in the flood and the plagues in Egypt?</p>\n\n<p>One view is that punishment is the result of natural consequences, which could have long-lasting effects and affect people, even for generations. If read in this way, it explains the meaning of Exodus 20:5, “visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation,” and Deuteronomy 19:15, “One witness shall not rise up against a person for any iniquity or for any misdeed.” This interpretation is supported by the Ralbag in his commentary on Exodus 20:4-5. He states that acts have consequences, for example, if a person acts improper and is therefore punished by exile, their children will grow up in exile. G-d does not inflict punishments for generations.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is Exodus 12:29 which says that all the first-born, even the cattle’s first-born were killed at midnight. This is symbolic, for the Egyptians felt that the first-born was a type of cast system. G-d wanted to strip away the pagan cast system. But is this consistent and reconcilable with the Rabbi's views?</p>\n\n<p>Chief Rabbi Hertz explained the nine plagues of Egypt as natural yet exaggerated events. He is silent regarding the 10th plague in this way. Why? Perhaps he felt the need for supernatural intervention? But the 10th plague can be explained naturally, too. Some rabbis see Scripture as exaggerating some events to make a point. If we apply this to the last plague than it would seem to be saying that it also struck them, the first-born. This makes sense when we consider all the aftereffects of viruses floating around from dead animals due to other plagues. This is also consistent with a just G-d, that acts have consequences and the events explained in the Bible as natural events, but nonetheless, divine. </p>\n\n<p>Because how could it be that a just G-d punishes people for generations? Unless we accept the Ralbag's view or another is presented, I do not see how we can reconcile these biblical verses with the rabbi's views, and if the rabbi's views do not matter, can we use these view to combat original sin? People do not inherit sin, they grow and can commit sin later in life. Indeed, the bar mitzvah is done when the child is thirteen because they are not accountable for their own sins. It could be that they died in the food/plagues to harm the parent, but is this fair? Many have claimed that these children would have turned out evil anyway and so it was a good to prevent they're coming into the world. If so, why did G-d create them, to begin with? No doubt the Nazis would have equally claimed Jewish babies as evil inclinations for their premature eradication and justification of the holocaust. Besides, the rabbi says that babies are innocent. The proof is that even some Amalekites converted to Judaism and become Torah-observant Jews, expressing the view that it is wrong to slaughter all women and children.</p>\n\n<p>The rabbi ends the chapter with this, \"The matter is settled by G-d's own pronouncement. No person inherits or is punished for someone else's sin.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, how do we reconcile G-d punishing generations and babies in the flood? Is it good enough to accept the Ralbag's interpretation in these instances? for G-d is just.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are too many questions and factors here to address all of them but a simple distinction can be made between the question and the examples given:</p>\n<p>Hashem does not punish any individual for the actions of others. When a group is being punished there may be innocent individuals who also suffer but that is not as a punishment per se.</p>\n<p>In modern day terms an analogy would be:</p>\n<p>Had Hitler had children they would not have been punished  for their father's actions.</p>\n<p>When the United State nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki even though many innocent people did in fact die the US was not looking to punish innocent people . It was a way to bring the conflict to an end. Had they not done so in such a manner  a lot more people would have gotten killed.</p>\n<p>Similarly L'Havdil when Hashem decides to punish a group (among many other potential reasons and factors)things have reached a situation that this is the best way to change things and run the world. It isn't a punishment for the innocent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The general rule is אוי לרשע אוי לשכנו, woe to the evil man and his neighbor. G-d does not initiate a punishment upon any person who is not worthy of punishment, but when the punishment is started, many times the punishment is one that is not \"held back\" to hurt only the intended target. Still, all of G-d's ways are just, and a person who is not meant to die just then will be moved far away, etc. But the \"collateral damage\" may include someone who would not otherwise have been deserving such a fate. That person is considered like one who died a natural death, or one who was indirectly hurt from the intended target.</p>\n<p>This concept is actually alluded to in the tenth plage (Shemos 12:23):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא יתן את המשחית לבא אל בתיכם לנגף</p>\n<p>And He will not let the destroyer come into your houses to afflict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this is also referring to outside harm (I think there is a Maharsha about that), one meaning is that the plague itself is being held back from afflicting the Jews.</p>\n<p>(I admit that it is still hard to apply in this case, because each Egyptian firstborn was individually targeted.)</p>\n<p>Two other rules that apply here:</p>\n<p>The world as a whole and a nation as a whole are judged in the same way as an individual is judged.</p>\n<p>Young children dying is a punishment to the parents, not to the child.

The Babylonian Talmud, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.109a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 109a</a> explains as follows: “Let us go up to the heavens and dwell there,” and Let us ascend and wage war against G-d.” They also said, “Let us ascend to heaven and worship our idols.”</p>\n\n<p>Talmud (Sandhedrin 109a) says that they attempted to reach the heavens in order to pierce it and drain the waters from the heavens in order to prevent another drainage. A Midrash says they felt the heavens would collapse annually, a natural occurrence. Frankly, I don’t see how this wouldn’t cause another deluge. </p>\n\n<p>The Targum Yerushalmi explains that the tower was to be a platform from which to battle G-d. Additionally, the tower’s top would depict a man with a sword drawn, symbolically declaring war against G-d. Others did it for idol worship, the tallest shrine. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya said they built it as a settlement. They wanted civilization to settle in view of the tower which was an affront against G-d’s plan to be fruitful and multiply. But how does this interrupt our relationship with animals, though?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The relationship with animals</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the Torah, Noah is told that “the fear of you and dread of you will be upon all the beasts of the earth, upon all the birds of the heaven, upon all crawling things, upon all the fish of the sea—they are delivered into your hands.” It seems that after the flood, the relationship between humans and animals changed. Noah was granted permission to eat meat (Genesis 9:3), Adam was only permitted to eat vegetation (Rashi on Genesis 9:3 and Genesis 1:24). They are told to \"subdue” the earth and “have dominion over” it.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, Israel has a holiday on the seventh day of the month of Shevat “Animal Rights Day,” which is a day to respect animals, for they too have feelings. This is the 7th law of Noah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Was the story of the tower of Babel literally?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that people really felt they could reach heaven? Could this be another example of hyperbole? A parable. It is not a literal story since the tower of Babel “reached into the heaven” is not understood literally. Some historians think it was possible for the tower to reach the height as described in the Bible. Nevertheless, they strived against G-d's command. Genesis 1:28 tells us that G-d commands us to replenish the earth. Abraham Ibn Ezra felt that the builders wanted to rebel against this command. Rabbi Samson R. Hirsch felt it was a community, not for a spiritual purpose though. Thus G-d punishes them with “confusion of speech” (Genesis 11:9). But this barrier, the inability to communicate with a different language provided much societal alienation. It makes for linguistic and cultural diversity or, is it possible that G-d never punished them. Perhaps the confusion of languages was the natural result of their behavior? Perhaps it is wrong to have “one language and one way of speaking.” </p>\n\n<p>Historians think differences in languages are a result of different cultures. People came from Africa and spread around the globe, each with his own unique language and culture. Nevertheless, will the day arrive when the world reverts to “one language and one speech” and people stop erecting Towers of Babels? The prophet Zephaniah says, “a pure language that they may all call upon the name of G-d to serve Him unitedly” (Zephaniah 3:9).</p>\n\n<p>All things considered, it seems that the generation of the Tower of Babel were not punished in the same way Noah's generation was punished. G-d leniency stemmed them because their society was relatively peaceful compared to Noah's generation which was full of violence and corruptness. Perhaps language diversity is a good. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> offers an interesting perspective on this topic:</p>\n\n<p>The people wanted to build the tower for two reasons.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To make a name for themselves by building a great tower, and to leave a memory of themselves.</li>\n<li>To help them not stray too far away.

When everyone is together, all it takes is one natural disaster in that one location to wipe out all of humanity. If, however, people spread out across the world, then even if there is a disaster in one area the people in the rest of the world will still survive, thus perpetuating the human race.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, God, in an act of Divine Providence, confounded the languages so that the people would move away from each other and spread across the world.

    "content": "# How to differentiate between a \"revealed\" Halacha and Paskened one?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>This question mimics a similar question about mathematics - is it discovered or created.</em></p>\n<p>Our Rabbis ruled a lot of Halochos. Some of them are considered \"the revelation of the original Halochos G-d gave to Moses\", for example, what the Gemmorah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Temurah.16a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Temurah 16a</a>) says :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במתניתין תנא אלף ושבע מאות קלין וחמורין וגזירות שוות ודקדוקי סופרים נשתכחו בימי אבלו של משה,<br />\nאמר רבי אבהו אעפ\"כ החזירן עתניאל בן קנז מתוך פלפולו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A different type of Halochos is what the Rabbis ruled by their authority to rule. A good example would be everything that the Rabbis Paskened knowingly against the true Halacha, as in the cases of Tanuro Shel Achnai or that money does not buy in place of Meshicha.</p>\n<p>My problem in studying the Talmud is the amount of effort I put into understanding the veracity of a particular ruling: if a Halachah is revealed it should reflect some kind of divine truth, while if it is simply ruled or accepted, it is pretty <em>arbitrary</em>, and there's no way of attesting its veracity.</p>\n<p>For example, a Succah's height can't be more than 20 Amas or should be at least 7 Tfochim wide. Is that how G-d sees what a Succah IS, or He didn't <em>care</em> and authorized the Rabbis to come up with whatever their imagination tells them, in a sort of \"החדש הזה לכם\" - you decide when you want your months to begin.</p>\n<p>For all other cases, where it does not say \"Halocho Lemoshe MiSinai\", is there a way of knowing that what the Rabbis ruled is \"Heavenly truth\" or a \"Rabbinical decree\"?</p>\n<p>(Needless to say, it has little of a practical difference, as both have the same power.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your answer requires more space (and more knowledge) than I have here, but I'll give it a shot, using Rambam's introduction to the Mishnah. (But please read the whole Introduction if you can.)</p>\n<p>Some of the statements of Rabbis are explaining laws that were revealed to Moses as part of the Oral Law. Some of them also have sources in verses that could be used to show that the law is true, and some were just accepted as tradition.</p>\n<p>As the Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דע כי כל מצוה שנתן הקב\"ה למשה רבינו ע\"ה נתנה לו בפירושה. היה אומר לו המצוה ואחר כך אומר לו פירושה וענינה.וכל מה שהוא כולל ספר התורה.\nKnow that each commandment that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Moshe, our teacher – peace be upon him – was given to him with its explanation. He would say to him the commandment and afterward tell him its explanation and content; and [so too with] everything that is included in the Book of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately for us, the Rambam's case used for illustration is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.2.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah.</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה לך משל שהקב\"ה אמר למשה בסכות תשבו שבעת ימים (ויקרא כג):\nAnd behold for you an example: When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, \"You shall live in booths seven days\" (Leviticus 23:42);</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam then goes on to give the specific <a href=\"http://https:/https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.2.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">example</a> you asked for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והודיע שהאכילה והשתיה והשינה בה כלו חובה. ושלא יהיה בחללה פחות משבעה טפחים אורך על שבעה טפחים רוחב. ושלא יהיה גובה הסוכה פחות מעשרה טפחים.\nAnd He made known that eating and drinking and sleeping in it is all an obligation; and that its space should not be less than seven finger-breadths long on seven finger-breadths wide, and that the height of the booth not be less than ten finger-breadths [sic, should be handsbreadths -N.T.].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbis also had the ability to add decrees to protect the original biblical law. The Rabbis have the authority to do this from the verses in the Torah telling the Rabbis to guard the Torah. As the Rambam also explains <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.12.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והחלק הרביעי הם הגזרות שתקנו הנביאים והחכמים בכל דור ודור כדי לעשותם סייג לתורה. ועליהם צוה הקדוש ברוך הוא לעשותם והוא מה שאמר במאמר כללי (ויקרא יח) ושמרתם את משמרתי ובאה בו הקבלה (יבמות דף כא.) עשו משמרת למשמרתי. והחכמים יקראו אותם גזרות.\nAnd the fourth division are the ordinances that the prophets and the sages ordained in each and every generation, in order to make a fence around the Torah. And about them did the Holy One, blessed be He, command to do them, and it is what He said in the general statement (Leviticus 18:30), \"And you will guard My guarding\" – and the received tradition came [to explain] (Yevamot 21a), \"Make a guarding around my guarding.\" And the sages called them ordinances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sages were also given authority over financial laws, including to remove money from one person and give it to another, which is called <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Sanhedrin_and_the_Penalties_within_their_Jurisdiction.24.6?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hefker beis din hefker</a>. As the Rambam explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן יֵשׁ לַדַּיָּן תָּמִיד לְהַפְקִיר מָמוֹן שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ בְּעָלִים וּמְאַבֵּד וְנוֹתֵן כְּפִי מַה שֶּׁיִּרְאֶה לִגְדֹּר פְּרָצוֹת הַדָּת וּלְחַזֵּק הַבֶּדֶק אוֹ לִקְנֹס אַלָּם זֶה וַהֲרֵי הוּא אוֹמֵר בְּעֶזְרָא (עזרא י ח) \"וְכל אֲשֶׁר לֹא יָבוֹא לִשְׁלֹשֶׁת הַיָּמִים כַּעֲצַת הַשָּׂרִים וְהַזְּקֵנִים יָחֳרַם כָּל רְכוּשׁוֹ\" מִכָּאן שֶׁהֶפְקֵר בֵּית דִּין הֶפְקֵר:\nSimilarly, at all times, a court has the prerogative to declare money belonging to others as ownerless. It may destroy those funds or give them to whomever they see fit to close any breaches in the faith and to strengthen its observance or to penalize a stubborn and difficult person. The Book of Ezra 10:8 states: \"Whoever fails to come in three days according to the advice of the officers and the elders will have all of his property confiscated.\" From this we learn that when a court declares property ownerless, their declaration is effective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.130?vhe=Sefer_HaChinukh_--_Torat_Emet&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">For example</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if [its value] appreciated in the hand of the robber, the appreciation is to the one who was robbed. And this is [the understanding] of that which is written in the Torah, \"and return the theft that he robbed.\" And the explanation comes - if it is the same as what he robbed, meaning that it has not changed, he must return it as it is, and even if it appreciated much.\nBut the Sages ordained (Bava Kamma 94b), as a result of the Ordinance of the Penitents, that anything that appreciates in the hand of the robber after the forsaking be his. And [so] when he comes to return it, he calculates with the robbed one how much it was worth at the time of the robbery; and the robbed one pays him the money of that which it appreciated, and takes it. And the Sages have the power to do this thing, since they may do according to their will in a monetary matter - and even against the commands of the Torah. As it is well-known that what the court makes ownerless is ownerless (Yevamot 89b, Gittin 36b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rambam Sefer Hamitsvot.</p>\n\n<p>The not revealed are dikduke sofrim</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל הסבה כי כל מה שיוציא אדם ענפים מן השרשים שנאמרו לו למשה בסיני בבאור והם תרי''ג מצות ואפילו היה המוציא משה בעצמו אין ראוי למנותם.</p>\n  \n  <p>והראיה על זה כלו אמרם בגמרא תמורה (גמרא תמורה דף טז-א) אלף ושבע מאות קלין וחמורין וגזירות שוות ודקדוקי סופרים שנשתכחו בימי אבלו של משה ואעפ''כ החזירן עתניאל בן קנז מפלפולו שנאמר (יהושע טו-טז) ''כל איש אשר יכה את קרית ספר ולכדה'' וגו' (יהושע טו-יז) ''וילכדה עתניאל בן קנז''.</p>\n  \n  <p>וכשהיו כך הנשכחות כמה היה הכלל שנשכח ממנו זה המספר, כי גם מן השקר שנאמר שנשכח ממנו כל מה שנודע ובלא ספק היו אותם הדינים המוצאים בקל וחומר ובזולתו מהמדות אלפים רבים ואלו כלם היו נודעים בימי משה.</p>\n  \n  <p>ונאמר עליהם דקדוקי סופרים כי כל מה שלא שמעו בסיני בבאור הנה הוא מדברי סופרים.</p>\n  \n  <p>הנה כבר התבאר כי תרי''ג מצות שנאמרו לו למשה בסיני לא ימנה בהן כל מה שילמד בשלש עשרה מדות ואפילו בזמנו עליו השלום כל שכן שלא ימנה בהן כל מה שהוציאו באחרית הזמן, אבל אמנם ימנה מה שהיה בפירוש מקובל ממנו והוא שיבארו המעתיקים ויאמרו שזה הדבר אסור לעשותו ואיסורו דאורייתא או יאמרו שהוא גוף תורה הנה נמנה אותו כי הוא נודע בקבלה ולא בהיקש ואמנם זכרו ההיקש בו והביאו הראיה עליו באחת משלש עשרה מדות להראות חכמת הכתוב כמו שבארנו בפירוש המשנה: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One may say that 'mathematical truth' is <em>created</em> - e.g. the concept of numbers and their operations are created by humans and exist in our heads.

But it is created in such a way as to be in line with the Divine will, as the Rabbis perceive it (assuming they're doing it lishma).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tzitzit - wool or linen - in relation to blue strings\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm a purist at heart so purchased linen tzitzit - of which I intended to add them to tallit of linen.  I was also going to have blue strings added, also in linen - so if you can get past my vague intro - my question is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Can blue strings be added to tzitzit if they are comprised wholly of linen, or do the blue strings have to be wool?</p>\n\n<p>I came across the following which led to my question - \nquote extract - Mois Navon P'til Tekhelet - it is worth mentioning that though you may have cotton tzitzit strings, the tekhelet strings must, be halachically, be dyed in wool. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A blue non-wool string is not Tekhelet, much like how margarine isn't butter even though they are quite similar. Usually you can't tie a wool string to a linen garment (\"sha'atnez\") but here it would be permissible because the command of tzitzit overrides that. However, that only applies during the daytime when tzitzit is obligatory. By rabbinic command we don't tie wool to linen garments at all lest you come to wear it at night. (Rambam Tzitzit 3:7)</p>\n\n<p>Some interpret the rabbinic command to prohibit any tzitzit on linen garments, and thus one should avoid rectangular linen garments if one can. (OC 9:6)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The techales has to be wool, no mater what the material of the rest of the garment. (Yevamos 4b). However, one is <strong>not allowed</strong> to put woolen techales (or white) strings on a linen garment (Shabbos 25b, and eleswhere).</p>\n\n<p>(This is actually midirobanan; midioraisa one does use techales from wool on a linen garment. But there is a concern, that one might be tricked into wearing what he thinks is techales but is really not, (think Radziner techales), or other possible concerns.)</p>\n\n<p>P.S.

He does not change, for there is nothing that can cause Him to change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>According to Rambam</strong>, does G-d \"change His mind\" to answer to our personal prayers? </p>\n\n<p>Note: this question is <em>only</em> about how Rambam sees their influence.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Eruvin 65a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר חנינא כל המתפתה ביינו יש בו מדעת קונו שנאמר (בראשית ח, כא) \"וירח ה' את ריח הניחוח וגו'\" ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tora and Gemara use a lot of expressions showing that G.d changes his opinion, as the above citation shows.</p>\n<p>There are paradoxes regarding daat hashem. We are limited and created. We see such things as paradoxes. What is a paradoxe, something that is true and seems contradictory because of a lack of understanding.</p>\n<p>Based on Rambam hilchot teshuva</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה,יב  כבר ביארנו בפרק שני מהלכות יסודי התורה שהקדוש ברוך הוא אינו יודע בדעה שהיא חוץ ממנו כבני אדם שהן ודעתם שניים, אלא הוא יתברך שמו ודעתו אחד; <strong>ואין דעתו של אדם יכולה להשיג דבר זה על בורייו</strong>.  וכשם שאין כוח באדם להשיג ולמצוא אמיתת הבורא, שנאמר \"כי לא יראני האדם, וחי\" (שמות לג,כ)--כך אין כוח באדם להשיג ולמצוא דעתו של בורא:  הוא שהנביא אומר \"כי לא מחשבותיי מחשבותיכם, ולא דרכיכם דרכיי\" (ישעיהו נה,ח).  וכיון שכן הוא, אין בנו כוח לידע היאך ידע הקדוש ברוך הוא כל הברואים ומעשיהם.‏</p>\n<p>As explained in the second chapter of Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, The Holy One, blessed be He, does not know with a knowledge that is external from Him as do men, whose knowledge and selves are two [different entities]. Rather, He, may His name be praised, and His knowledge are one.</p>\n<p>Human knowledge cannot comprehend this concept in its entirety for just as it is beyond the potential of man to comprehend and conceive the essential nature of the Creator, as [Exodus 33:20] states: \"No man will perceive, Me and live,\" so, too, it is beyond man's potential to comprehend and conceive the Creator's knowledge. This was the intent of the prophet's [Isaiah 55:8] statements: \"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways, My ways.\"</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we do not have the potential to conceive how The Holy One, blessed be He, knows all the creations and their deeds. However, this is known without any doubt: That man's actions are in his [own] hands and The Holy One, blessed be He, does not lead him [in a particular direction] or decree that he do anything.</p>\n<p>This matter is known, not only as a tradition of faith, but also, through clear proofs from the words of wisdom. Consequently, the prophets taught that a person is judged for his deeds, according to his deeds - whether good or bad. This is a fundamental principle on which is dependent all the words of prophecy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>if you speak from HIS point of view, he already knows about tefilla etc, about your choices etc, But the principles of Emuna are that tefilla and teshuva have influence and so we have to do a lot for ourselves. The Top-Down science of Hashem and the Bottom-Up are paradoxical because we cannot understand the Gap. This is a gap of knowledge called paradox.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, G-d does not change. This means that G-d never spoke to anyone. The Rambam writes in the first chapter of his Mishneh Torah that G-d created nature, a divine creation, and Moshe copied the governing rules of nature and produced the Torah, which is certainly divine. Now that we understand that G-d is immutable, we can try to comprehend how He responds to prayer. Philosophers like the Greek pagan Aristotle felt that prayers help improve people and are a time of self-reflection. The Hebrew word for prayer is lehitpaleil. The root is p-l-l, which means “judge.” Prayer means to \"judge one’s self.\"</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides, Aristotle's philosophical successor, felt that G-d does not listen to prayer. The world functions according to the laws of nature. Nothing we do will alter or change natural law. G-d is transcendent and it is impossible for us to describe Him. Any description we put will only <em>remove</em> our understanding of what G-d is. At best we can say that G-d has no body and is one. Rambam says that G-d's uniqueness and oneness are so One, that we cannot compare anything else to Him. G-d <em>is</em> One but not in the unity of one. For instance, if I take a chair and say, \"Surely this is one chair,\" it is not really one since it is made up of many components, that make up the chair. G-d is unlike this chair which if disassembled, will have legs, cushions, seats, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Since G-d is One, it follows that G-d cannot change. If G-d cannot change, G-d cannot become angry when you sin and be happy the next when you make teshuva by making a prayer. Thus, G-d does not have emotions and He does not listen to prayer. This is, to my humble understanding, the Rambam's view on prayer (but it is by no means all of Judaism's view on prayer). </p>\n\n\n",

(Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem this literal 'separation of hearts', is a negative expression of conflicting views and lack of togetherness, an anti-'Love your neighbour like yourself' approach.</p>\n<p>This idea is also brought out in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Leviticus.26.6.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim</a> in Vayikra 26:6 where he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונתתי שלום בארץ. צריך לדעת למה הוצרך לומר זה אחר שכבר אמר וישבתם לבטח, ואולי שיכוין על עם בני ישראל עצמם שלא יהיה להם <strong>פירוד הלבבות</strong> שיטע ה' ביניהם שלום וריעות. או אפשר שיכוין על כללות העולם, ותדע שכשמדבר על ארץ ישראל מזכירה בכינוי כאומרו בסמוך בארצכם, וכאן אמר בארץ שמבטיחם כי יהיה שלום בכל העולם, ותמצא שחפץ ה' בדבר, וצא ולמד מפרי החג ע' כנגד ע' אומות, ומאמרי רבותינו ז''ל (סוכה נ''ה:) בענין זה, גם כפי הטבע כשיש מלחמות בעולם יחרדו גם היושבים בטח לקול ענות מלחמה, ולזה גמר אומר ושכבתם ואין מחריד</p>\n<p>ונתתי שלום בארץ - \"and I will grant peace to the land\": Why did the Torah have to mention this seeing it had already promised us that we would dwell securely in our land? Perhaps the Torah refers to the people of Israel keeping the peace amongst themselves, that there would not be <strong>internal divisiveness</strong>. G-d promises to implant a tendency for mutual tolerance amongst the people. Remember that when the Torah speaks of the land it usually describes it as \"your land,\" i.e. the land with a suffix. When the word ארץ is used without the suffix it refers to the whole earth. In this instance you find that G-d wants universal peace. When you consider the 70 bulls the Israelites offered in the Holy Temple on behalf of the Gentile nations on Sukkot, our rabbis in Sukkah 55 speak about this. Moreover, whenever wars occur on earth even people who are at peace in their respective countries worry about their becoming themselves involved in warfare. This is why the Torah adds the assurance ושכבתם ואין מחריד, \"you will lie down to sleep without anyone frightening you.\" (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once again, the term would seem to imply a lack of harmony amongst the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Rav Tzadok perhaps best encapsulates the term in his Pri Tzadik on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Tzadik%2C_Mishpatim.7.1?vhe=Pri_Tzaddik,_Lublin,_1901&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpatim 7:!</a> where he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...היינו הלא אנו רואין שיש <strong>פירוד לבבות</strong> בנפשות ישראל ואין דעתן של א' שוה לחבירו...</p>\n<p>This means that we saw that there was a <strong>separation of hearts</strong> in the souls of Israel and that A's opinion was not equal to that of his friend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is used <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> to indicate divisons of opinion which get in the way of a national unity (\"hearts\" reflecting practice, belief and tradition).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=tFZIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PR9-IA13&lpg=PR9-IA13&dq=%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA&source=bl&ots=HlFHN3v3Oo&sig=ACfU3U3_RmKOV1QrhGyyKArDzuOkAHhXzQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj13qjkrdjlAhUG2VkKHS74Ak4Q6AEwBXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> use seems to reflect \"discord\" and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=J7HWnRsQBb0C&pg=PA520&lpg=PA520&dq=%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA&source=bl&ots=7Psf34GyHV&sig=ACfU3U0s8wuViyYbnYgPPTRooVVcAT7qFw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj13qjkrdjlAhUG2VkKHS74Ak4Q6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> one takes it a step further, coupling it with Sinat Chinam.</p>\n\n\n",

Anyone have an idea why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>From what I can tell, the original was בפי and then it was changed to בפה, and then later changed back to בפי. Some details:</p>\n<p>Grammatically, we'd expect בפי here, since the word meaning \"mouth\" is in construct state (בפה means \"in a mouth\", בפי means \"in (the) mouth of\"; the latter is correct here). Similarly, in ברוך שאמר we see בפי עמו, in אל אדון we see בפי כל־נשמה, and in the non-weekday after-bracha on haftara, we see בפי כל־חי. The word פה in all these cases would appear to be ungrammatical.</p>\n<p>A popular explanation for the form בפה in ברוך שאמר that is due to the Ari: changing from בפי to בפה to allude to the 87 (gematria of בפה) words in his version of ברוך שאמר, allowing a further allusion to ראשו כתם פז (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.5.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 5:11</a>; the gematria of פז is also 87; this allusion appears in earlier works by the Ḥasidei Ashkenaz). The Ḥida, while surprised at the Ari's ungrammatical change, brings a kabbalistic reason for saying בפה. However, R. Shabtai Sofer and R. Shlomo Zalman Hanau, authors of very popular works on the siddur, came out strongly against בפה, and support בפי in their texts. See Naftali Wieder's article<sup>1</sup> on this topic for many many more details on the back and forth. At the end of the day, the Ari's בפה was accepted by the Magen Avraham, the Peri Ḥadash, Aruch HaShulḥan, and other more modern halachic decisors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Wieder shows that the version בפה preceded the Ari, and was in fact the majority reading among French/Ashkenazi siddurim from the 13th century on, at latest. There also seems to be no relevance of בפה to the number of words, as many versions of ברוך שאמר had a different number of words. More on topic for this question, בפה appeared additionally in all four spots in question (ברוך שאמר as well as אל אדון and ברכת ההפטרה and ברכת המזון).</p>\n<p>Instead of the common explanation, Wieder proposes that the change from בפי to בפה was due to a vulgar meaning of the word <em>fi</em> in Old French and Old German (and probably in many old Romance languages): it meant \"fie\", an exclamation of disgust (see <a href=\"https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/fi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). You can see how it would be inappropriate to say מהולל בפי עמו and מבורך בפי and יתברך שמך בפי with that meaning in mind!</p>\n<p>As support, Wieder cites Maharam MiRothenberg as requiring a dagesh in פי (so it would be pi, not fi) in כי פּי ה׳ דבר (in על הכל when taking out the Torah), and the Tashbetz writes that this is so as not to curse God. Similarly, the Minḥat Shai <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.8.3?lang=bi&with=Minchat%20Shai&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a> that there were those who wanted to say פּי (pi) instead of פי (fi) in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.8.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 8:3</a>, to avoid cursing God.</p>\n<p>As another example of this phenomenon, Moshe Bar-Asher writes<sup>2</sup> that in certain Iraqi texts of נשמת, we see the text of וה׳ ער לא ינום ולא יישן vs. the text of וה׳ אלהים אמת לא ינום ולא יישן. The former text was apparently changed to the latter text because ער means penis in colloquial Arabic.</p>\n<p>Wieder further brings examples (including modern siddurim) where בפה and בפי stand in the same volume (sometimes with a difference between חול and שבת!). He writes that the tension involved in grammar vs. kabbalah and tradition (even if it's a recent tradition) leads to such inconsistencies. In general, in modern times, many Ashkenazi decisors and the printed siddurim have mostly followed the views of the grammarians (like Sofer and Hanau, among others) who have \"corrected\" the text of the siddur to be more grammatical (in their eyes). As I wrote at the beginning, בפי is certainly more grammatical in all the locations, and has become more and more popular. For example, the Artscroll Ashkenazi siddur I have here reads בפי for all but ברוך שאמר (probably to follow the Ari), whereas the Koren Ashkenazi siddur I have reads בפי for all four.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup> תיקונים בנוסח התפילה בהשפעת לשונות לועזיות by נפתלי וידר, p469 in volume 2 of התגבשות נוסח התפילה במזרח ובמערב.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> לשוננו רינה by משה בר־אשר, p190.

Burns of Syracuse, New York.[7] His knife had sections of grooves or serrations, inclined with respect to the axis of the blade, that form individual small cutting edges which were perpendicular to the blade and thus cut without the excessive normal pressure required of a scalloped blade and without the horizontal force required by positive-raked teeth that would dig into the bread like a wood saw. There were also sections of grooves with the opposite direction of inclination, separated by a section of smooth blade, and the knife thus cut cleanly in both directions in both hard and soft bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If so, perhaps the serrated knives that preceded that time were much more like saws, and would not do a good job cutting bread.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.250?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama O.C. 250:1</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגה ויש להשחיז הסכין בערב שבת כי זהו מכבוד השבת שמכין עצמו לאכילה (כל בו וב\"י בשם ספר חיי עולם):</p>\n<p>RAMA: Additionally one should sharpen his knife on Erev Shabbat, for this honors the Shabbat and prepares him for eating.

The Rambam (Mishne Torah Gerushin <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957711/jewish/Gerushin-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 6</a>) writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(6:3) <strong>A husband may [...] appoint an agent to deliver a get to his\n  wife.</strong> Such an agent is referred to as a delivery agent (sh'liach\n  holachah).

When I discussed your question with R Binyamin Tabady, he mentioned the Maharsha writes that it is only a <em>mitsva</em> if the woman behaved improperly (e.g., relations with others), otherwise writing a <em>get</em> is permitted but is in no way a <em>mitsva</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If it is a <em>mitsva</em>, we can build on the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.41a.4?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 41a</a> which writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it is more fitting that the mitzva be performed by the man himself\n  than by means of his agent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>as well as the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.9b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baba Kama 9b</a> which writes that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>what Rabbi Zeira said is that for the embellishment of the performance\n  of a mitzva, e.g., to purchase a more beautiful item used in the\n  performance of a mitzva, one should spend up to one-third more than\n  the cost of the standard item used to perform the mitzva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>to suggest that there is a <em>hiddur mitsva</em> (beautification of the <em>mitsva</em>) to do it in person.</p>\n\n<p>But if the divorce is due to personal preferences, e.g., lack of fit between the spouses, then these <em>gemarot</em> don't apply and there is no benefit to giving the <em>get</em> in person.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, a rabbi who knows the couple should be approached to balance the above sources with his knowledge of the specifics of the situation and help come to a practical decision.</p>\n\n\n",

[The Gemara proceeds to deduce several halachos from this connection, which are beyond the scope of this answer.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This statement therefore implies that whenever the Deuteronomy verses exchange <em>anything</em> with respect to the Exodus ones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The two terms were both said at Mount Sinai in the same breath.</li>\n<li>The exchange comes to teach a unique halacha by connecting the two principles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, returning to your question: part of the significance of the change is that it indicates that the two terms were said simultaneously on Mount Sinai, but furthermore, it indicates a connection between the laws of coveting with the laws of desiring. What is this connection? </p>\n\n<h1>What type of desire is mentioned here?</h1>\n\n<p>Shevuos is silent on the tenth commandment, but other sources aren't. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_DeRabbi_Shimon_Bar_Yochai.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta of R' Shimon 20:14</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא תחמד ולהלן הוא אומר (דברים ה' י\"ח) לא תתאוה לחייב על תאוה בפני עצמה וחמדה בפני עצמה מניין התאוה אדם סופו לחמוד שנ' לא תתאוה ולא תחמוד:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Do not covet.\" And there it says, \"Do not desire\" - to obligate on the desire separately and the coveting separately. How do I know that desire leads a person to coveting? As it says, \"Do not desire,\" \"Do not covet.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way the Rambam understands this Midrash is as follows (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Robbery_and_Lost_Property.1.10-12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gezeilah 1:10,12</a>; nearly identical wording is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.359.10-12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, CM 359:10-12</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כֵּיוָן שֶׁחָשַׁב בְּלִבּוֹ הֵיאַךְ יִקְנֶה דָּבָר זֶה וְנִפְתָּה בְּלִבּוֹ בַּדָּבָר עָבַר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר \"לֹא תִתְאַוֶּה\" וְאֵין תַּאֲוָה אֶלָּא בַּלֵּב בִּלְבַד הַתַּאֲוָה מְבִיאָה לִידֵי חִמּוּד וְהַחִמּוּד מֵבִיא לִידֵי גֵּזֶל.

Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to theft [...] You have learned that one who desires violates one prohibition and one who acquires the object which he desires by pressing the owners or by requesting of them violates two prohibitons. Therefore it says, \"Do not covet\" and \"do not desire.\" If he stole it he violates three prohibitions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Desire does not just refer to desire, but also actively plotting how to get the object. (As an aside: The Torah never prohibits random thoughts which may pop into your mind; it prohibits dwelling on them. This is the point made by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.416.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch 416</a>, who notes that only thoughts which are in one's control are prohibited.)</li>\n<li>Desiring is taught in the same breath as coveting to teach that desiring indicates the type of desiring which can lead to coveting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Coveting and desiring what?</h1>\n\n<p>That sufficiently explains why the verbs are swapped, but what about the objects? As you note, in Exodus we're proscribed from coveting houses, wives, slaves, animals, and \"anything else,\" while in Deuteronomy coveting is limited to wives and desiring is applied to houses, <em>fields</em>, slaves, animals, and \"anything else.\" These lists are identical with two important changes: wives aren't singled out by desiring, nor are fields by coveting.</p>\n\n<p>Let me ask you a more basic question: If the verses are just going to say \"and anything which is to your friend,\" why bother listing specifics? The Midrash (Mechilta ad. loc.) understands each point to teach that the laws of desiring and coveting are expanded to include more things. I won't go into the entire Midrash here, as the first line is sufficient to answer your question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יכול לא יתאוה על בתו ליטלה ת\"ל אשת רעך מה אשת רעך שהיא אסורה לך אף כל דבר שאסור לך: </p>\n  \n  <p>I might have thought he can't desire his daughter to take her; the verse teaches, \"Your friend's wife\" - just as your friend's wife is forbidden to you, so, too, anything which is forbidden to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As noted earlier, your friend's wife is not mentioned at all by desiring, yet that's the verb the Midrash uses here. Seemingly, based on the above connection between the two, it's sufficient to make the one change by each and infer that the differences mentioned by one are applicable to the other.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The changes are meant to signify that each variant was said simultaneously on Mount Sinai.</li>\n<li>The changes are meant to signify that the laws of one can be extended to the other; specifically:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The switch from \"covet\" to \"desire\" teaches us which type of desire is meant: not just any desire, but specifically desire which will lead to coveting.</li>\n<li>Mentioning wife only by coveting and field by desiring allows us to extend the inclusions of each one to the other prohibition as well.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

He said, “In the Generation of the Flood, there were eight: Noah\n  and his sons, and their wives, but they did not save their\n  generation.” And for nine, together with counting [God] he had already\n  asked, but did not find.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avraham knew that there had to be ten righteous people because Hashem had already showed at the time of the flood that fewer could not save a society. In the time of Noach, Hashem waited until Mesushelach died before bringing the flood. At that time, Hashem was considered part of the count and Noach, his sons, and their wives totaled eight. Mesushelach was the tenth righteous person who kept the flood from occurring. Avraham realized this and therefore had to stop at ten.</p>\n\n<p>The meforshim do ask why he started at fifty? Rashi explains that Avraham wanted to save all five cities. However, when there were not 50 (10 in each city) or 45 (Hashem being the tenth in each city), then he tried to save as many cities as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:29</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Perhaps forty will be found there:</strong> And four cities will be saved, and\n  so thirty will save three of them, or twenty will save two of them, or\n  ten will save one of them. — [from Zohar, vol. 1, omissions, 255b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/showrashi/true#v26\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:26</a> says that the lower numbers might still be considered to show that the society still accepted some righteousness and that they could therefore be allowed to live in the hopes that the next generation might be affected.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>God answered</strong>: If there are still, in a state like Sodom,\n  fifty righteous men who not only publicly live a moral and just life, but\n  who can even stand up for morality, justice, and humaneness, then not\n  only למענם, not only for the considerationof, for the sake of, these\n  righteous ones, but בעבורם through them, because these righteous ones\n  exist ans are tolerated, the whole city deserves forgiveness.</p>\n  \n  <p>Their existence and being tolerated would itself be a proof that the\n  degeneration had not yet reached the lowest depth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch deals with the continuation of Avraham asking for fewer people and the change in the wording of the answer in verse 28 as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gradually increasing demand in Abraham's requests and the change\n  in terms used in the replies לא אשחית, לאאשחית, לא אעשה, also seems\n  strange. Perhaps the following suggestions may throw some light. If\n  our assumption of the nature of the incident is correct, then God's\n  reply looks on the saving of the town, if fifty righteous men can be\n  found, from a different point of view from Abraham's supposition. Not\n  out of consideration for them and their feelings but on the ground of\n  their existence, of their being there at all. From the former point of\n  view, of course the cosideration for the righteous would become less\n  and less the fewer their number happened to be, but that could not be\n  the case from the latter point of view. If the number of its members\n  is imposing, it is tolerated out of fear. If it is small enough to be\n  negligible, it is tolerated only because it is overlooked. Only when\n  it consists of a medium number, where it is neither feared nor\n  overlooked, does its existence, its being tolerated, have its full\n  significance. Above this number and below it, its significance\n  lessons.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Perhaps</em> Abraham was seeking clarity concerning this condition and perhaps the change in the expression might correspond to it. לא אשחית,\n  I will not destroy, will not bring כלה, but will perhaps interpose My\n  authority otherwise to effect betterment: אדעה: לא אעשה, I will do\n  nothing at all, there are sufficient moral elements among the masses\n  so that a betterment from within is still not impossible. Hence, with\n  forty five, twenty, and ten, לא אשחית, and only with forty and thirty\n  לא אעשה. Perhaps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Below ten, not only was the number so negligible as to be ignored, but it was too small for Hashem to be able to use His authority to raise the level of the future generations (as we have seen by Noach).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Had there been in the purlieus of Sodom and Gomorrah, ten righteous\n  men to be found, God would not have despaired of a better future for\n  all, and would have let them all live for this better future. But\n  where God shows us no reason to despair, we too must courageously\n  preserve an play our part, and unremmitingly and confident of ultimate\n  success stand up for what is right even in it means being in\n  opposition to the whole of our erring contemporaries, and even if this\n  ultimate victory will only dawn long after we are in our grave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Seems like a standard debating/negotiating tactic. If Abraham asks what amount of righteous people is necessary, he will receive a direct answer. Any further debating/negotiating has to cause a change to the answer. </p>\n\n<p>If he starts with a number that everyone would obviously agree with, and then proceeds to steadily decrease the amount it is much harder to reject the plea. At any point in the discussion the switch from yes to no will seem arbitrary. It may even be possible to get all the way down to 1 by arguing that there is no real difference between 1 and 2, and there is no real difference between 2 and 3, etc. As such, Abrahams’s method may simply have been more conducive to extracting the desired response. </p>\n\n<p>(Whether human debating/negotiating tactics should be used when debating/negotiating with God should perhaps be a separate discussion.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Three answers from the Zohar:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each question Abraham asked teaches something else; each question eliminated that there were any tzaddikim there in terms of the merits taught here in these \"numbers.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A8_%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar I:104b - Midrash ha-Ne'elam</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[דף קד ע\"ב]   מדרש הנעלם:   \"ויהו\"ה אמר המכסה אני מאברהם וגו'\" -- מה כתיב למעלה, ויקומו משם האנשים וישקיפו על פני סדום, לעשות דין ברשעים, מה כתיב אחריו, המכסה אני מאברהם, אמר רבי חסדא, אין הקדוש ברוך הוא עושה דין ברשעים עד שנמלך בנשמתן של צדיקים, הה\"ד (איוב ד ט) מנשמת אלו\"ה יאבדו, וכתיב המכסה אני מאברהם, אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא, כלום יש לי לעשות דין ברשעים עד שאמלך בנשמת הצדיקים, ואומר לה הרשעים חטאו לפני אעשה בהם דין, דכתיב ויאמר יהו\"ה זעקת סדום ועמורה כי רבה וחטאתם וגו'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if they learn the fifty Torah portions?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי אבהו, הנשמה עומדת במקומה, והיא יראה להתקרב אליו ולומר לפניו כלום, עד שאומר למטטרו\"ן שיגישנה לפניו ותאמר מה שתרצה, הה\"ד ויגש אברהם ויאמר האף תספה צדיק עם רשע חלילה לך וגו', אולי יש חמשים צדיקים וגו', הנשמה פותחת ואומרת, רבונו של עולם שמא נתעסקו בנ' פרשיות של תורה, ואף על פי שלא נתעסקו לשמה, שכר יש להם לעולם הבא, ולא יכנסו לגיהנם, מה כתיב בתריה, ויאמר יהו\"ה אם אמצא בסדום חמשים צדיקים וגו', והא (תנינן) יתיר אינון נ\"ג פרשיות הוו, אלא אמר רבי אבהו, חמשה ספרים הם בתורה, ובכל אחד ואחד נכללים עשרת הדברות, עשרה מאמרות שבהם נברא העולם, חשוב עשרה בכל חד מנהון הם חמשים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If not, then what if they're ashamed and therefore reckoned as if having been punished (40 lashes)?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד פותחת הנשמה ואומרת, רבונו של עולם אף על פי שלא נתעסקו בתורה, שמא קבלו עונשם על מה שחטאו בבית דין ונתכפר להם, שנאמר (דברים כה ג) ארבעים יכנו לא יוסיף, וממה שנתביישו לפניהם דיים להתכפר (לפניהם) להם שלא יכנסו לגיהנם, מה כתיב אחריו לא אעשה בעבור הארבעים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if there are tzaddikim who have attained the thirty attributes?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד פותחת ואומרת, אולי יש שם שלשים, אולי יש ביניהם צדיקים שהשיגו שלשים מעלות הרמוזים בפסוק (יחזקאל א א) ויהי בשלשים שנה, והם כלולים בל\"ב נתיבות שהם כ\"ב אותיות, ועשר ספירות ולפעמים הם כלולים לשמונה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if they'll raise children to learn Torah thus receiving the reward of the Ten Commandments twice per day (=20)?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד פותחת ואומרת, אולי ימצאון שם עשרים, שמא יגדלו בנים לתלמוד תורה, ויש להם שכר כאילו קבלו לעשרת הדברות שתי פעמים בכל יום, דאמר רבי יצחק, כל   [דף קה ע\"א]   המגדל בנו לתלמוד תורה, ומוליכו לבית רבו בבקר ובערב, מעלה עליו הכתוב כאלו קיים (עליו) התורה ב' פעמים בכל יום, מה כתיב ויאמר לא אשחית בעבור העשרים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if they're of the first ten in synagogue?\n...

Usually English translations renders it \"Ur of the Chaldees/Chaldeans\". It is impossible for Kasdim to mean Chaldeans if the Torah was written by Moses since the Chaldeans only came to Mesopotamia around 8th century BCE. And Abraham cannot be Sumerian (Ur was a Sumerian city) since Sumerians were not semetic people. So what was Abraham's ethnicity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is two questions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) How could the Torah describe the city of Ur as being of the Chaldeans if they didn't exist yet?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Torah clearly describes a city in which Avraham and his father resided as being called <em>\"Ur Kasdim\"</em>, so either </p>\n\n<p>a) The Torah is using a \"borrowed\" and contemporary-to-a-future-time name (Chaldeans) in place of some proto-Babylonian people (Sumerians?) - see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.10b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a similar example:</p>\n\n<p>b) There were in fact Chaldeans at the time, and the assumption in the question is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) What was Avraham's ethnicity - and were the inhabitants of Ur Semitic?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Avraham was certainly descended on the male line directly from <em>Shem</em> and then <em>Ever</em> - see the details of his descent at the end of <em>parshas Noach</em> - so definitely Semitic in the basic sense. The inhabitants of <em>Shinar</em>/<em>Bavel</em>/Iraq were likely descended from Cham (10:10 - though it's not conclusive - and I don't know if Ur is the same as ancient <em>Shinar</em>). This doesn't contradict Avraham's being Semitic as: </p>\n\n<p>a) His father was an immigrant from \"Semite-land\" - possibly Syria/Aram/Charan (see Ramban who proves this from Avraham being Semitic and not a Hamitic Chaldean - like the questioner does)</p>\n\n<p>b) There were always descendants of <em>Shem</em> living in Ur- possibly who had never left there (see 10:11).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some more information on the naming of Ur, and the ancestry of the Kasdim:</p>\n\n<p>I had a look at R' Aryeh Kaplan <em>z\"l</em>'s Living Torah Chumash (a good source for this kind of thing) and brings the following sources:</p>\n\n<p>1) In a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.11.28.3?lang=bi>\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">comment</a> on the first mention of Ur Kasdim, Redak writes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>באור כשדים</strong>: שהיום נקרא אור כשדים, כי באותו הזמן לא נולד כשד שיקראו בניו כשדים.</p>\n\n<p>That is: The Kasdim/Chaldeans were descended from Avraham's nephew Kesed, and the city was not yet called Ur Kasdim as he wasn't born yet.</p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0146:book=1:section=143&highlight=chaldeans\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Josephus</a> and the the apocryphal Book of Jubilees associate Kasdim with Arphachshad - son of Shem. </p>\n\n<p>Jubilees (11:3) writes that Ur son of Kesed (presumably Arpachshad) founded the city around three hundred years before the birth of Avraham. Though this source carries little weight, from both Jewish and academic perspectives, the approach would allow for a Semitic Ur at the time of Avraham.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to Genesis 14:13, Abraham was a Hebrew (<em>’ivri</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Radak ad loc. explains this as a reference to Abraham’s ancestor Eber.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Avraham was a Hebrew.

If you want to\n  exit Judaism, the only way you can do it is by converting to Islam</strong> ... On the Jewish side, I’m thinking of Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah where he talks about Rabbanites and Karaites. There’s a fierce bit where he says Karaites are apostates from Judaism and should be killed. Then he says, “I’m not talking about the descendents of those Karaites — it’s not their fault, we get along fine with them — but the people who actually apostatized from Judaism, they should be killed.” ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>from <a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/2006/05/22/how-and-why-muhammad-made-a-difference/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As I don't know jewish tradition, scripture and history, I don't really understand the point the scholar is making about <em>\"Jews can only exit by converting to Islam, and not Christianity\"</em>.

The interviewee is saying that in Islamic law it is forbidden to change from any one religion to any other religion other than Islam.

Once someone is a Jew, whether by being born into it or by converting, that person is always a Jew according to <em>halacha</em>.  A Jew who \"converts\" to Christianity or Islam is a sinning Jew.  This <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1269075/jewish/Is-a-Jew-Who-Converts-Still-Jewish.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article from Chabad</a> provides a good introduction to the topic.</p>\n\n<p>A Jew who was raised by secular parents, or who abandoned Judaism without practicing another religion, can return freely.  Such a person is called a <em>ba'al teshuva</em>.  From this we learn that Jewish status doesn't depend on continuous observance.  A Jew who abandoned Torah to instead practice some other religion and then does <em>teshuva</em> might be required to undergo some <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7776/472\">special processes</a> before fully returning to the Jewish community, but the person is nonetheless still a returning Jew, like the <em>ba'al teshuva</em>, not (say) a convert from Islam.

(At least, I have never seen this done at any wedding that I have attended.)</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is a rule that for someone to <em>motzi</em> someone else of a birkat hamitzvah, the person making the bracha must have the same mitzvah obligation.

What was the drawing factor in Lot marrying such a seemingly selfish woman?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>To fully grasp why Lot married the woman he married we must first understand Lot.</p>\n\n<p>G-d tells Abraham that He will destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. We read in chapter 19, that Lot shows the visitors (angels) hospitality. However, in Genesis 19:5, the Sodomites ask for the angels. They wished to desecrate them. Rather than expose the angels to homosexuality, Lot offers his daughters instead. It is good that he tries to protect them, but the willingness to surrender his daughters to brutal rape and the impact it would have for the rest of their lives only goes to show that Lot saw his daughters as property. Is it right to offer his daughters to save the lives of strangers? Would it be more appropriate to offer his own life or, try to escape altogether?</p>\n\n<p>There are other instances, too. When G-d gave Abraham the land of Israel, Abraham took the smaller land to settle the dispute because family was important to him. It was essential to keep the peace between brothers. Lot, didn't see it quite like that and arrogantly took the much larger land and cattle as a prize. Lot even pitched his tent facing Sodom, the land of the sinners. He would eventually mingle with themtoo, residing in the filth. Later, Genesis Rabba states that Lot was captured because he foolishly settled in Sodom. After the destruction of Sodom, his daughters thought the world was going to end and had sex with him while he was unconscious. </p>\n\n<p>In short, Lot, Abraham’s nephew, was corrupted. Where Lot sought riches, Abraham sought spirituality and to come closer to G-d. Indeed a Midrash and the Rambam state that Abraham discovered G-d. These are the characteristics of a G-dly man.</p>\n\n<p>Lot's predicament led him to marry a selfish woman, like himself. Her fate was sealed when Lot’s wife turns into a pillar of salt in Genesis 19:26. Lot was spared. Perhaps it was because G-d wanted to give him another chance to act justly. And he did. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PS The Midrash Genesis says that Abraham was so holy that he perceived angels the way how others see regular human beings; but Lot, who was not so pious saw angels as angels. Yet others like the Rambam said that neither saw angels. It was a dream. </p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara questions the apparent redundancy. It is written: “Flour,” and it is also written: “Fine flour.” Rabbi Yitzḥak says: <strong>From here we learn that a woman is more stingy with guests than a man.</strong> Sarah wanted to use merely flour, and Abraham persuaded her to use fine flour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The logic is a bit fragile.  Anything else in the Sources about women being less generous than men with guests?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>It is important to note that Rabbi Yitzḥak, like Maimonides and Aristotle, was a product of his time. This argument of course does not necessary support moral relativism. But it does explain the bigger picture, the context of which these people lived. George Washington owned slaves, yes, but that does not make every thing ever he did inadequate. Had Washington lived today he wouldn’t have owned slaves. He was a very honorable man, despite his involvement in the slave trade. In fact, most abolitionist who advocated for the abolition of the slave trade said racist things. For example, they felt that only Europeans could free the Africans. Great men like Thomas Jefferson despised slavery but had no immediate solution to the problem. We can and should understand men like Maimonides or R Yitzhak in the same way. They felt that women were less educated only because their contemporaries influenced them in this way, but that by no means suggest they would feel this way about woman today. Although this did not answer your question outright, I felt obligated to expunge any misrepresentation of the rabbis for people unfamiliar with the context. In the end we should judge the act and not the actor.</p>\n\n\n",

Some went as far as to say that Noah was only righteous in his generation (and would not be in another) simply because he did not warn anyone about the coming flood. Indeed the Mishnah, Pirke Avot 2:6 says that: “An individual who acts without reason can still be a righteous fool.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It looks like it's coming from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Bereishit_Rabbah.49.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 49:2 on Bereshit 18:18</a>, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוּדָה בְּרַבִּי סִימוֹן</strong> לְמֶלֶךְ שֶׁהָיוּ לוֹ שְׁלשָׁה אוֹהֲבִים וְלֹא הָיָה עוֹשֶׂה דָּבָר חוּץ מִדַּעְתָּן, פַּעַם אַחַת בִּקֵּשׁ הַמֶּלֶךְ לַעֲשׂוֹת דָּבָר חוּץ מִדַּעְתָּן, נָטַל אֶת הָרִאשׁוֹן וּטְרָדוֹ וְהוֹצִיאוֹ חוּץ לַפָּלָטִין, שֵׁנִי חֲבָשׁוֹ בְּבֵית הָאֲסוּרִים, וְנָתַן סְפָרְגִים שֶׁלּוֹ עָלָיו, <strong>שְׁלִישִׁי שֶׁהָיָה חָבִיב לוֹ יוֹתֵר מִדַּאי אָמַר אֵינִי עוֹשֶׂה דָּבָר חוּץ מִדַּעְתּוֹ.</strong> כָּךְ, אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן (בראשית ג, כד): וַיְגָרֶשׁ אֶת הָאָדָם. נֹחַ (בראשית ז, טז): וַיִּסְגֹּר ה' בַּעֲדוֹ. <strong>אַבְרָהָם שֶׁהָיָה חָבִיב עָלָיו יוֹתֵר מִדַּאי, אָמַר מָה אֲנִי עוֹשֶׂה דָּבָר חוּץ מִדַּעְתּוֹ</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Simon who made the observation.</p>\n\n<p>This quote from the midrash explains in connection with G-d's questioning the idea of concealing the judgement against Sodom from Avraham, that G-d had a special love (that he was cherished <em>more than appropriate</em>) for Avraham above and beyond others (<em>Adam and Noach are listed as examples of those not loved like Avraham. Thus, Adam was separated and Noach was imprisoned at the time of judgement.</em>). And that because of that special type of love, G-d sought Avraham's opinion in things that G-d would do to the world.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your association of Moshe Rabbeinu to this special type of merit connected with Avraham, the beginning of the linked midrash explains how this merit from Avraham was passed along to the 70 individuals who descended to Egypt, who ultimately became the 70 Elders who transmitted the teachings of Avraham to Moshe, who explained the Torah in 70 languages.</p>\n\n\n",

However, he concludes that it is preferable to sleep in a private sukkah with his wife.<br>\n  <strong>Taz 639:9</strong> asks on the Rama that if he is correct the Sukkah should be pasul since it isn't fit to be used for sleeping (Rama 640:3). Rather he defends the Minhag in another fashion. He writes that a married man has a mitzvah to sleep in the same room as his wife to gladden his wife even if she isn't Tahorah. That mitzvah makes him exempt from the sukkah.<br>\n  <strong>Magen Avraham 639:8</strong> has a different justification which is that a person would be pained about not being able to sleep in the same room as his wife and someone who is pained by the sukkah is exempt. He explains that this doesn't render the sukkah Pasul since it is fit for sleeping and he just has a personal external exemption. Rav Ovadia Yosef in Chazon Ovadyah (pg 196) agrees with the Taz.<br>\n  <strong>HaGr\"a 639:13</strong> argues with the Rama. Following the Gra, Mishna Brurah 639:18 writes that men are obligated to sleep in the Sukkah without their wives and it’s not pained by not sleeping in the same room as his wife unless it’s the night of Onah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If anything, if I ate the lettuce with the worm, I might taste the worm. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The difference between the scenarios is not an abstract difference between nonkosher food and worms, but between cooked and uncooked food and food of the same type and food of different types. </p>\n\n<p>First, taste only transfers if cooking occurs with heat higher than Yad Soledet Bo or one of the substances is \"sharp\" like an onion (neither worms nor lettuce have \"sharp\" taste).  If the worm and lettuce were cooked together, the lettuce would be forbidden even after the worm was removed. If no cooking occurs, the lettuce is kosher and you only need to get rid of the worm. The cooked chicken has all received nonkosher taste and is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>The other difference is that the worm and lettuce are different types of food, while the types of chicken are the same type of food. </p>\n\n<p>For a mixture of different substances, two standards decide whether the mixture is forbidden:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is the taste of the forbidden substance discernable?</li>\n<li>Is the proportion of the forbidden substances bigger than 1/60?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Poskim debate whether both criteria must be met to forbid the mixture or only one. If the worm is removed neither criterion is met and the lettuce is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>The Chachamim and Rabbi Yehuda  (Menachot 23a) debate the case of similar substances like chicken. Rabbi Yehuda forbids even the smallest amount, while the Chachamim allow the mixture to be eaten if the forbidden food is less than the permitted food (Batel B'rov). If the food is cooked, though, the whole mixture is forbidden according to all opinions because of taste transfer.</p>\n\n<p>Edit. As commenters have noted, the worm could be considered harmful taste, which is permitted even after cooking (although the worm must be removed if it has not completely disintegrated). They also point out that I was acting under the assumption that the worm was greater than 1/60 of the lettuce which is usually incorrect.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Chicken transfers a \"good taste\" (נותן טעם לשבח), whereas insects and other creepy crawlers transfer a \"bad taste\" (נותן טעם לפגם). The former taste needs to be removed prior to cooking further, while the latter does not. </p>\n\n<p>Before we can talk about nullifying taste in the same or different \"Min,\" it's important to understand what taste is prohibited in the first place. A bad taste (Ta'am Pagum) does not need to be nullified further, whereas good taste does. See Yoreh Deah 100, 103, and 109.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The basic idea is that we consider “טעם כעיקר”  is that taste is like the actual item. So when the taste of the forbidden chicken goes into the kosher one, there is effectively forbidden chicken intertwined with it. Whereas by the worm on the lettuce once the worm is removed there is no taste left in the lettuce. \nI’m sure there’s a better source but I happened to bump into the pri megadim’s intro to bassar vechalav recently so that’s what comes to mind.

    "content": "# Why did our forefathers live in tents in Israel and not in houses?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It appears that there's a clear trend of our forefathers, Avraham, Tzhak, and Jacob, <strong>to dwell in tents</strong> in the Holy Land, wandering from one place to another, instead of settling down, taking hold of the land and building houses, despite the fact that the Land was promised to be theirs. </p>\n\n<p>For example Avraham:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...וְהוּא יֹשֵׁב פֶּתַח־<strong>הָאֹהֶל</strong> ... וַיְמַהֵר אַבְרָהָם <strong>הָאֹהֱלָה</strong> אֶל־שָׂרָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or Itzchak:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...וַיְבִאֶהָ יִצְחָק <strong>הָאֹהֱלָה</strong> שָׂרָה אִמּוֹ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>IIRC, they were sitting in one place for years - Hebron, Kiryat Arbah, Avraham even bought a graveyard and Yakov bought a piece of land in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.33.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shechem</a> (for Yossef's grave?), but the Torah does not mention them dwelling in houses*. (There's only one place <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.33.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in Succot</a> where Yaakov mentioned \"building a house for himself\", however many interpret it metaphorically - he built Beis Midrash, he built Beis Israel, etc, and the Torah itself does not mention him actually living in a house).</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, we can see that in parallel many Biblical figures lived in houses:</p>\n\n<p>For example Lot: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר הִנֶּה נָּא־אֲדֹנַי סוּרוּ נָא <strong>אֶל־בֵּית עַבְדְּכֶם</strong> ...:<br>\n   וַיָּבֹאוּ <strong>אֶל־בֵּיתוֹ</strong>... ׃<br>\n  ... אַנְשֵׁי הָעִיר אַנְשֵׁי סְדֹם נָסַבּוּ <strong>עַל־הַבַּיִת</strong>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or Betuel and Lavan: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...וְאָנֹכִי פִּנִּיתִי <strong>הַבַּיִת</strong> וּמָקוֹם לַגְּמַלִּים... and many many others in the same Parasha</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or Pharaoh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... וַתֻּקַּח הָאִשָּׁה בֵּית פַּרְעֹה...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the Torah does mention very explicitly all other characters living in houses and doesn't mention the forefathers doing so, I think this can not be attributed to simple omissions.</p>\n\n<p>What might be a reason for such strange behavior?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>I found it interesting that this behavior is consistent with some historical theories that present the Israelites as nomads and wanderers even in \"their own country\", unlike all other surrounding nations - Egyptians (Pharaoh) or Babylonian (Betuel) that lived in fixed settlements.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Except for one place (I could find): \"וַתִּקַּח רִבְקָה אֶת־בִּגְדֵי עֵשָׂו בְּנָהּ הַגָּדֹל הַחֲמֻדֹת אֲשֶׁר אִתָּהּ בַּבָּיִת\"</p>\n\n\n",

Then they returned to the level of their forefathers, which was the secret of G-d upon their tents, for they themselves are the Merkavah (chariot).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is to say that by the Avos, they personally were \"grounding spots\" for the Divine Presence, as where their personal tents, without the need for a separate temple. Only for the nation, where not every individual is on such a high level, is a central house of worship needed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -6)\n\n<p><strong>Are Chazal always right?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is true that Chazal say that a temple could not be built until Israel went to war with Amalek. Amalek, although a war-like nation, should not be attacked until a peace offer has been made, or that fighting should cease from the Jews if certain requirements were met. See Mishneh Torah, Concerning Kings and Wars 5:1 and 6:1, 4. It suffices to say that Amalek came from being a nation to a philosophical concept of evil itself, for example, the nazis. That aside, the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 96b, says that not all of Amalek (nation) should be killed, for many of them later became proselytes to Judaism, becoming Torah scholars in B’nei Berak. Besides, Chazal's statement makes it seem as though G-d needs a bloody war for the temple to be built. </p>\n\n<p>So what is the real reason why David did not build a temple? or, for that reason, the forefathers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The real reason for the absence of the Temple</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moses, the founder of Rabbinic Judaism, was ordered to build a simple portable tent-like structure, called the Tabernacle. The mobile tent followed the Israelites wherever they went. It is not as far as a stretch for the purpose of this tent-like temple. For one, it provided people a place to worship or draw near to G-d in times of exile or wonderings. It also was the only building material they had. They certainly could have built a temple if they wanted. Indeed they built the grand temples for Pharaoh. The reason they resorted to a tent-like structure was that they were always on the move, like nomads, traveling to the promised land, the land of their fathers, the land of Israel. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all dwelled in tents. It might have been a culture thing, too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Other reasons for the Sanctuary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biblical sanctuary tent was partially constructed in the manner that it was in order to show that it was not a permanent dwelling spot for a noncorporeal G-d. The “Meeting House,” was a place where people went to metaphorically meet with G-d. When David took Jerusalem, he thought it time to construct a more permanent residence of worship, not only the political capital but a spiritual center. However, the book of Samuel in II Samuel 7:6 reports how prophet Nathan told David that now was not the time nor the place. This was due to David's sins, G-d has become angry with him. </p>\n\n<p>The biblical book of I Kings 5:3 avoids the theological issue altogether. In it, Solomon informs Hiram the king of Tyre the reasons for his father's neglect for the construction of a temple. Saying,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of\n  the L-rd his G-d because of the warfare with his enemies who\n  surrounded him, until the L-rd put them under the soles of his feet.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, David was preoccupied with war. Later commentaries, including the Talmud, would portray David as piously playing the harp and his court studying the scriptures. This is hardly the case. The royal court spared no time for study except for Shabbat and other rear occasions. The political life of a king wasn't all fun and games. It consisted of much work and immense responsibility of running the kingdom. As all national leaders, they were often preoccupied with national affairs and had little time, if any, to devote themselves to the life of a pious rabbi. Even rabbis worked as a second profession. Rambam put many emphases on an occupation besides a rabbinical degree. </p>\n\n<p>That aside, I Chronicles 22:8 reports G-d saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You have shed much blood and\n  have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to My name because\n  you have shed so much blood before Me upon the earth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This supports the idea that David was preoccupied with sex, war, and national security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides say</strong></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the Guide of the Perplexed 3:32 makes a radical statement, but one that makes sense. It states that G-d does not want or need a temple. Indeed, G-d is neither in want or need of anything. The temple and sacrifices were necessary as a concession to the primitive nature of human beings. People, Maimonides stressed, should seek G-d by studying all that there is to know about Him, which is the study of science and philosophy, metaphysics, and the laws of nature, not pious study, secluded, contributing nothing to society. One can see this as a prime example among the Patriarchs. They were preoccupied with philosophy and the new idea that G-d is one: the monotheistic revolution. This may be the chief reason why the patriarchs saw no need for a temple or tent. Abraham, the founder of Judaism, discovered G-d by studying the heavens, the laws of nature. Only then did G-d come to him. Abraham saw no need for a temple or the mitzvahs. However, the Rambam goes on to explain this as the chief reason why the Israelites forgot about G-d while in slavery in Egypt. People cannot just rely on philosophy. Thus, G-d made another concession by giving us a gift, the Torah and the mitzvot.[1]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many of the patriarchs never saw a need to build a house of worship. When they did, they constructed one similar to their dwellings, a tent. Later, David, ever wanting for glory, decided it was time to construct a temple where the new capital of Israel will be built. When he acted improperly, that right is taken away and is inherited by Solomon. Yet, G-d never desired a temple. It is a concession to human needs. People need to feel that they can draw close to G-d. As a result, G-d allowed the sacrifices but, He restricted them to certain animals that were kosher.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] The Torah is certainly holy. It follows that the Torah should <em>not</em> be abandoned in the messianic age like the sacrifices or, as some claim, the mitzvolt. I found this idea that the Torah is a concession in Menachem Kellner's Science in the Bet Midrash: Studies in Maimonides, where he states that, \"Maimonides' notorious claim to the effect that the Torah as we have it is a concession to the primitive character of the Israelites leaving Egypt.\" He goes on in the footnote to write, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"To traditional Jewish ears this sounds shocking. Indeed, Maimonides himself wrote about it: \"I know that on thinking about this at first your soul will necessarily have a feeling of repugnance toward this notion and will feel aggrieved because of it\" (Guide, III.32, p. 527). But the fact of the matter is that in structural terms, Maimonides is making a claim very similar to that made by Kabbalists; only when they make it, it sounds very religious. When Maimonides makes it, it sounds shocking. There is an important strand in Kabbalah, expressed openly by Nahmanides, amongst others, that the Torah as we have it exists in its corporeal form only because of the sin of Adam and Eve, and will cease to exist in the form in which we know it in the messianic era. I have a hard time understanding how that differs in structure from Maimonides' position (I realize that the music is very different.)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Rambam writes that even if one wants to live on a boat or live in a tent it is permitted to do so, even though he cant perform mezuzah. From this Rambam its mashma that a tent never requires a mezuzah even if one lives in it his whole life.</p>\n<p>Text of Rambam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש מצות עשה שאדם חייב להשתדל ולרדוף עד שיעשה אותה כגון תפילין וסוכה ולולב ושופר ואלו הן הנקראין חובה לפי שאדם חייב על כל פנים לעשות ויש מצוה שאינה חובה אלא דומין לרשות כגון מזוזה ומעקה שאין אדם חייב לשכון בבית החייב מזוזה כדי שיעשה מזוזה <strong>אלא אם רצה לשכון כל ימיו באהל או בספינה ישב</strong> וכן אינו חייב לבנות בית כדי לעשות מעקה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation of text (Chabad):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are positive commandments that a person is obligated to make an effort to pursue [their fulfillment] until he performs them - for example, tefillin, sukkah, lulav, and shofar. These are referred to as obligations, since a person is obligated to fulfill them.</p>\n<p>There are other mitzvot that are not obligations, but resemble voluntary activities - for example, [the mitzvot of] mezuzah and constructing a guardrail. A person is not obligated to dwell in a house that requires a mezuzah [just in order] to fulfill this mitzvah. <strong>Instead, if he desires, he can dwell in a tent or a ship for his entire life.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Ran is based on the principle that thinking is not equivalent to speaking, e.g. for blessing. </p>\n\n<p>But the Beur Halacha discusses this issue.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עיין בביאור הגר\"א שמקשה ע\"ז דהלא הרהור בתורה הוא ג\"כ מצוה כדכתיב והגית בו יומם ולילה ובנשמת אדם רוצה לדחות הקושיא ועיין בבנין עולם שמשיג על הנ\"א ומסכים להגר\"א. אמנם מה דמשמע שם מיניה דלהגר\"א הרהור בתורה הוא כדבור ממש ומחמת זה כתב שם דמה שכתב הרמ\"א בסימן ס\"ח דמי שלומד ע\"י הרהור וכו' לית ביה איסורא וכו' הוא אזיל לשיטתו בכאן דמסכים בהג\"ה להמחבר דאפילו בתורה הרהור לאו כדיבור דמי משא\"כ לשיטת הגר\"א יהיה איסורא אפילו ע\"י הרהור דחשיב הפסק בברכות ק\"ש ולענ\"ד לא כיון יפה דגם הגר\"א מודה דאפילו בתורה הרהור לאו כדיבור אלא דס\"ל דגם ההרהור הוא מצוה כדכתיב והגית בו יומם ולילה וכ\"מ לשונו להמעיין בו היטב ועוד ראיה ברורה לדברי דאל\"ה מאי מקשה הגמרא בשבת ק\"נ ע\"א מי אר\"י הרהור לאו כדיבור דמי והא\"ר יוחנן בכל מקום מותר להרהר בד\"ת חוץ מבהמ\"ר וכו' התם נמי כתיב ולא יראה בך ערות דבר וכו' הלא לענין ד\"ת לכו\"ע הרהור כדבור וא\"כ אפילו אם ולא יראה קאי ע\"ז ג\"כ הרהור אסור אלא ודאי כמו שכתבנו ודוק:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Beur Halacha says that the GRA objects that even Tora thinking is a Mitsva, on the basis of Gemara.

People should develop their intellect and not rely on blind faith.</p>\n\n<p>It is true that the Mishna and Rambams’ 13 principles of faith says that whoever rejects the resurrection, for example, loses their share in the world to come. However, some scholars insist that Maimonides rejected a physical resurrection. They feel that Rambam believed in a spiritual resurrection instead, that of the soul. For why should the soul wish to rejoin the body when the soul is enjoying bliss in the world to come? According to Maimonides there is no physical resurrection, only intellects. </p>\n\n<p>But is it reasonable to accept that Rambam rejected a Mishna? </p>\n\n<p>As shocking as this may sound to most traditional Jewish ears, the answer is that it does not matter. Judaism never based its opinion of a person in what they believed but on how they acted. In his book Kosher Jesus, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach explores the difference with Judaism and Christianity.[1] Where Christianity relies on blind faith (the acceptance of Jesus or else,) Judaism judges people by what they do, their behavior. Do people honor their parents, do they keep the Mitzvahs, give to charity. Judaism is not concerned with how you think. There is much commentary and schools of thought within Judaism.

Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>May one lie about household finance situation?</li>\n<li>May one lie about the way the spouse looks? (Wife puts on an outfit and asks, \"Does this make me look fat? Do you like the color, fit, etc.?\" Let's say the husband doesn't like it but knows wife would be annoyed hearing the truth.) or the way food tastes, something s/he did incorrectly, etc.?</li>\n<li>May one lie about one's health to prevent worrying or upsetting his / her spouse?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are numerous examples. Is there any guideline or set of conditions that explains when one may be allowed to lie? Also, should / can one tell a complete falsehood or should he tell a partial lie. (E.g., if he doesn't like his wife's cooking, can he say he likes it totally, or should he say, \"It's not my preference, today.\")</p>\n\n\n",

The term used for Yishmael, מצחק, means that he mocked actively and viciously. It therefore is a completely different usage.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that their are two different meanings involved. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216/showrashi/true#v3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeirah 21:3</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3 And Abraham named his son who had been born to him, whom Sarah had\n  borne to him, Isaac.</p>\n  \n  <p>the birth of this child was צחק, something, according to natural\n  conditions, rather laughable (see above on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8212/showrashi/true#v17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter XVII,\n  17</a>).\n  So when Abraham called his son יצחק these facts were vividly in his\n  mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The statement in Vayeira 17:17 shows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>17 And Abraham fell on his face and <strong>rejoiced</strong>, and he said to himself,\n  \"Will [a child] be born to one who is a hundred years old, and will\n  Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Yishmael actually went to great extremes in his <em>making fun</em> of the ideas of Avraham. As Rav Hirsch says on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216/showrashi/true#v9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 21:9</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He took in just as much of the great ideas of Abraham to make him\n  ironically disdain them, and over that which the world in general\n  greeted merely with צחוק, in which (V.6) derision was only lightly\n  mixed, Ishmael was completely מְצַחֵק, and was therefore completely\n  unfit to join with Isaac in the heritage of Abraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>And I say: (Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai) \n“God forbid that there be, in the house of this righteous man, anyone doing such things! Rather, this “playing around” has to do with the inheritance - Ishmael was fooling around and saying, “I am the eldest, and so I will take a double portion.”<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Sotah.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Sotah.6?lang=bi</a></p>\n\n<p>in this context, perhaps one can say that Ishmael was doing more than just playing around. He was, more precisely, “Isaac-ing.”  In other words, he was trying to be Isaac - to take his place, to be the inheritor.</p>\n\n\n",

Isn't suffering a punishment too? What then is suspended?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>This is a very interesting question. One possible answer is that G-d created the world, implanted the laws of nature, and has no further interaction with His creations. With this theory there is a long and tedious explanation for this philosophical view regarding the revelation of the Torah that does not bear repeating as it goes well beyond the scope of this answer. Yet it is essential for understanding the answer. Thus, I will give a brief summary for the sake of brevity. Simply stated, Rabbi Micah Goodman says that in the first chapter of his Mishneh Torah Rambam writes that G-d does not speak. How was the Torah revealed? Moshe looked into the laws of nature (that is a divine creation) and produced the Torah. Similarly, Abraham discovered G-d by studying the heavens, natural law. Thus, the Torah is certainly holy.[1]</p>\n\n<p>So whether one wants to agree or not, there is another concept that we should recognize, that the world functions according to the laws of nature that G-d has created.  One of these laws is that actions have consequences, and they can have long-lasting effects even for generations. For example, King David made a sin, an adulterous relationship with Bat Sheva. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that people make repentance, teshuva in Hebrew, actions have consequences, (David also repented), but due to the consequences of his actions, he suffered and his punishment came later when he discovered the immense pain he caused not only for himself but countless others.</p>\n\n<p>[1] See Maimonides and the Book That Changed Judaism: Secrets of \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" by Micah Goodman</p>\n\n\n",

Retzichah 1:2-3</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִצְוָה בְּיַד גּוֹאֵל הַדָּם [לַהֲרֹג אֶת הָרוֹצֵחַ] שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (במדבר לה יט) \"גֹּאֵל הַדָּם הוּא יָמִית אֶת הָרֹצֵחַ\". וְכָל הָרָאוּי לִירֻשָּׁה הוּא גּוֹאֵל הַדָּם. לֹא רָצָה גּוֹאֵל הַדָּם אוֹ שֶׁלֹּא הָיָה יָכוֹל לַהֲמִיתוֹ אוֹ שֶׁאֵין לוֹ גּוֹאֵל דָּם בֵּית דִּין מְמִיתִין אֶת הָרוֹצֵחַ בְּסַיִף: הָאָב שֶׁהָרַג אֶת בְּנוֹ. אִם הָיָה בֶּן לַנֶּהֱרָג הֲרֵי זֶה הוֹרֵג אֲבִי אָבִיו מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא גּוֹאֵל. וְאִם אֵין לוֹ בֵּן אֵין אֶחָד מִן הָאַחִין נַעֲשֶׂה גּוֹאֵל הַדָּם לְהָמִית אֶת אָבִיו אֶלָּא בֵּית דִּין מְמִיתִין אוֹתוֹ.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a Mitzvah in the hand of the redeemer of blood to kill the murderer, as it says, \"The redeemer of blood - he will kill the murderer.\" Whoever is fitting to inherit, he is the redeemer of blood. If the redeemer of blood doesn't want to, or is unable to, kill him, or he does not have a redeemer of blood, the courts kill the murderer by the sword. If a father killed his son: If the victim has a son, he kills his grandfather, because he is the redeemer. If he does not have a son, none of the brothers are made a redeemer of the blood to kill his father, but rather the courts kill him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Important parts for our question:\n - The heir is the redeemer of blood.\n - If there is no redeemer of blood, the courts kill the murderer.\n - If a man kills his son, and there are no grandchildren, the courts kill the murderer.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam himself (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Inheritances.1.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hil. Nachalos 1:2</a>), if a man dies with no children, his father inherits him. If the heir is the redeemer of blood, why isn't the father given the opportunity to redeem his son's blood? It would seem, then, that the murderer cannot kill himself to avenge his son's blood.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another proof (which also fleshes out the logic behind this halacha) can be brought from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Murderer_and_the_Preservation_of_Life.1.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=he&p2=Maaseh_Rokeach_on_Murderer_and_the_Preservation_of_Life.1.3.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rokeach to Rambam, Hil. Rotzeach 1:3</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין אחד וכו' להמית את אביו וכו'. לאו דוקא מיתה, דהוא הדין הכאה או קללה או ביזוי אף שהוא ראוי לכך, כמו שכתב רבינו סוף פרק ה' דהלכות ממרים עיי\"ש.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"None of the [brothers are made a redeemer of the blood] to kill his father.\" Not specifically killing, as this is the law for hitting, cursing, or embarrassing, even though he is fitting for this, as our teacher wrote at the end of Mamrim, chapter 5; see there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let's see what he has to say there. Rokeach seems to be referring to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.5.15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hil. Mamrim, 5:15</a>, where he makes direct reference to our halacha that the brothers cannot be redeemers of blood, and in halachos 12-15 there he discusses several similar halachos. All of them boil down to: since hitting, cursing, and embarrassing one's parents is a Torah prohibition, even if the parent deserves it, the son should not be the one to mete it out.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing would seem to apply here: even if, theoretically, the father is eligible for being a redeemer of blood, there's still a prohibition involved in the father killing himself and so it should be carried out by someone else if possible.</p>\n\n\n",

To enforce their Rabbinical decrees over which they had little control, they accompany many of them by invoking Heavenly capital punishment.

At the designated time, <strong>I will return</strong>, and Sarah will have a son” </p>\n\n<p>So here is my question: is the <em>he</em> really one on the men? Or is it G-d who speaks from the beginning or through his messenger? Because these messengers seem to be close to the tent and hear Sarah laughing. And ‘he’ says: I will return, while later it’s clear G-d says He will return. And again in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.21.1?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 21:1</a> this seems to be the case. We read nothing of one of those men (who were malachim) returning right? So how could one of them says: I will return? </p>\n\n<p>How do I need to explain these things? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.10?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Genesis 18:10</a> (the first verse you cite with \"I will return to you\") explains that the angel is speaking on behalf of G-d.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוב אשוב. לֹא בִשְּׂרוֹ הַמַּלְאָךְ שֶׁיָּשׁוּב אֵלָיו, אֶלָּא בִשְׁלִיחוּתוֹ שֶׁל מָקוֹם אָמַר לוֹ, כְּמוֹ וַיֹּאמֶר לָהּ מַלְאַךְ ה' הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה, וְהוּא אֵין בְּיָדוֹ לְהַרְבּוֹת, אֶלָּא בִּשְׁלִיחוּתוֹ שֶׁל מָקוֹם, אַף כָּאן בִּשְׁלִיחוּתוֹ שֶׁל מָקוֹם אָמַר לוֹ כֵּן</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I will surely return.\" The angel did not tell him that he will return to him, but rather through the agency of G-d did he say this to him. This is like \"The angel of G-d said to her, 'I will surely increase'\" (Genesis 16:10). It is not in [the angel's] power to increase, but rather through the agency of G-d. So, too, here, through the agency of G-d did he said this to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: The \"he\" is one of the angels, but he is speaking for G-d. (Let me emphasize this: G-d is <em>not</em> one of the men.) G-d says \"I\" the second time, speaking for Himself, and, as you point out, G-d is indeed the one who \"returns\" to grant Sarah a son in 21:1.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.18.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Bartenura_on_Torah%2C_Genesis.18.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> learns that it was <strong>the door</strong> that was behind the visitors, and they couldn't see Sara. Not that she was in the doorway. The stress is that she was extremely modest and would not have laughed out loud enough to be heard.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to your assertion that \"Sarah starts to laugh which is heard by the men outside.\" (which is actually contrary to the explicit verse that she laughed to herself - וַתִּצְחַ֥ק שָׂרָ֖ה בְּקִרְבָּ֣הּ.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>והוא אחריו</strong> הפתח היה אחר המלאך. בא רש\"י לפרש שלא תאמר דמה דכתיב והוא אחריו שהמלאך היה אחר הפתח כמשמעות דקרא דאם כן היה צריך לומר ששרה היתה פתח האהל מבחוץ וזה אינו שהרי כתוב הנה באהל צנועה היא:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when you translate הנה באוהל as “<strong>See</strong> (here) in the tent.” it's incorrect. It should be \"behold! In the tent\", since the couldn't \"<strong>see</strong>\" her.</p>\n\n<p>So the angles reported the news, nobody heard Sara's reaction and then Gcd gave a promise that He'd return a year later.</p>\n\n\n",

Should You, however, say that the righteous cannot save the wicked—but why should You kill the righteous at all?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, at the end of Avraham's prayer in pasuk 32, Rashi explains Avraham doesn't ask about less than ten because Noach's family which numbered eight couldn't save their generation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אולי ימצאון שם עשרה. עַל הַפָּחוּת לֹא בִקֵּשׁ, אָמַר דוֹר הַמַּבּוּל הָיוּ ח', נֹחַ וּבָנָיו וּנְשֵׁיהֶם, וְלֹא הִצִּילוּ עַל דּוֹרָם; וְעַל ט' עַל יְדֵי צֵרוּף כְּבָר בִּקֵּשׁ וְלֹא מָצָא:</p>\n<p>PERADVENTURE THERE SHALL TEN BE FOUND THERE — For a smaller number he did not plead because he knew already of two instances where less than ten had failed to save the wicked.

Perhaps the power of the many is required to save other people.</p>\n\n<p>However, Avraham learnt from the first answer of Hashem that the Tzadikim themselves will be saved.

He felt that Abraham questioned the verdict in Genesis 18 on the grounds of objective justice, and of course, for his nephew Lot. While he was concerned for Lot, he was equally concerned for other good people who may be residing in the city in general. Leon Kass then reveals a novel idea. Abraham had to stop at ten because if he “reduced the argument to (will you save the city for) one (person) it would have been too obvious that he was asking G-d to save Lot.”[1]</p>\n\n<p>Abraham was concerned for all peoples, indeed he taught the truth to whoever he met in his tent. But he couldn't make G-d think that he only cared, selfishly, for Lot alone. Of course, G-d is not oblivious[2], but I think Leon Kass answered this well.</p>\n\n<p>[1] See Peshat Isn’t so Simple by Rabbi Hayyim Angel</p>\n\n<p>[2] Ralbag, as well as Abraham ibn Ezra, felt that G-d only knows the general things but not the particular</p>\n\n\n",

One possibility is that the location where the food is packaged may also process shellfish (likely on entirely different equipment or at least on the same equipment with a thorough washing before kosher production). Because of the risk of cross-contamination the company mentions shellfish on the allergy label. But note that this is a package of flax seed. Flax seed is the only listed ingredient. Shellfish is clearly not an ingredient in this food. Any traces of shellfish in the package would be unintentional and easily <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/611/when-its-null-and-void-understanding-batel-bshishim-one-sixtieth/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">batel beshishim</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that the product is processed in multiple locations, some of which also process shellfish. Companies often prefer to not have their packaging depend on the location of the product's processing, so they might just mention the non-kosher allergens even on packages of product produced in kosher-certified locations. Granted, if some locations are certified kosher and others aren't, they'd have to change the packaging anyway to include the hechsher only on the kosher-certified product.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, if the product has a reliable kosher certification and is produced by a moderately well-known company, you can be rather certain that the product is indeed kosher.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is MK's response:</p>\n\n<p>This product is TOTALLY kosher and this is an allergen warning only.</p>\n\n<p>For more info about allergens, see our Kosher Minute video, by clicking on this link: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MKCanadasKosherCertifier/videos/466389873540856\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.facebook.com/MKCanadasKosherCertifier/videos/466389873540856</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the gemara not consider the possibility that someone will warn his wife about seclusion when he's mad at her?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara in Sotah 2b discussed two different versions of a statement by Rabbi Eliezer: one from the mishna on 2a and one from a beraisa. In the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer states that in order for a woman to be obliged to drink the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordeal_of_the_bitter_water\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sotah water</a> her husband must have warned her in front of two witnesses not to be secluded with a particular other man and then a single witness (even the husband himself) is believed to say that she <em>was</em> secluded with that man. In the beraisa, the requirements are flipped. The husband is believed on his own to state that he warned the wife, but two witnesses of seclusion are required.</p>\n<p>The chachamim argue on Rabbi Eliezer in the beraisa that \"אין לדבר סוף\". In other words, if the husband never warns the wife not to seclude herself, she will do so. Then, if he gets mad at her for doing something terrible like burning the cholent, he can find tw o witnesses to her seclusion and claim to have warned her in the past, getting her in trouble. The gemara seems to accept that this and a corresponding argument are legitimate arguments against Rabbi Eliezer in <em>both</em> the mishna and beraisa, but it tries to determine in which case the argument is stronger. In the end the gemara concludes that the argument is stronger against Rabbi Eliezer in the beraisa because in the mishna's case there is a reason to be suspicious already:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אדרבה למשנתינו איכא עיקר התם ליכא עיקר</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: On the contrary, according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer cited in our mishna, there is a legitimate basis of suspicion with regard to the woman, as there are witnesses who saw the husband issue a warning to her, and therefore, it is understandable that the testimony of the husband may be relied upon when he testifies that she secluded herself with another man. By contrast, there, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, there is no legitimate basis to prohibit her to him, since there are no witnesses that she had been warned by her husband at all. Therefore, it may be that the Rabbis took issue only with the version of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion presented by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</p>\n<p><sub>Translation/interpretation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.2b.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi comments there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>איכא עיקר</strong> - שכבר התחיל בעדים שלא ע\"י כעס:‏</p>\n<p><strong>There is a basis</strong> - because the situation already began in front of witnesses before he was angry.</p>\n<p><sub>Translation mine</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So my question is the following: Suppose I'm a bit more devious than Rashi gives me credit for. Even according to the mishna I could get my wife in trouble. When I get mad at her for burning the cholent, I can just summon two buddies and warn her in front of them. Then the next day I can claim that I saw her seclude herself, even though it's not true. This doesn't seem any more difficult than the case of the beraisa, so why doesn't the gemara (according to Rashi's understanding) consider that possibility? Another way of asking the question is, why does Rashi assume that the warning occurred before the husband was angry?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara seems to allow for this possibility, but says that it is less likely.</p>\n\n<p>People will be far quicker to act in anger to immediately get her into trouble while they are still angry, than to set up a situation they can then act on later. Also, even if they only warn her out of anger, there is still a good chance that he will not act on it afterwards when his anger has passed.</p>\n\n<p>So your case is definitely possible, but we don't have to worry about it nearly as much as the chance someone would lie about having warned her in the past.</p>\n\n\n",

But, as far as I understand, one may tear open a food bag (like a bag of chips) on Shabbat. Yet, one may not cut between the letters that are on a cake on Shabbat, because that's considered erasing.</p>\n\n<p>Why is tearing allowed but \"erasing\" not allowed?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not limiting my question to these two comparisons. There are probably others, but I can't think of them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I used to hear about tearing for food on Shabbos too many years ago.\nI once heard Rav Yisra=oel Reisman in his Navi shiur say that people are mistaken when they say that \"you can tear on shabbos for food\". He said that on Yom Tov we have ochel nefesh but on Shabbos he has no idea when such an erroneous popular idea came from.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I too was under the impression that there are extra leniencies on <em>shabbat</em> which are granted because of the concept of עונג שבת. However, I was unable to turn up any source for this. In every respect, the laws of <em>shabbat</em> would apply equally to food and non-food items, and as others have pointed out, your example of tearing the bag would apply equally to a bag not containing food needed for <em>shabbat</em> (say, the pieces of a board game).</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I remembered learning that the three conditions under which בורר is permitted are the acronym אכ\"ל, <em>ochel</em> - אוכל, ביד (ולא בכלי), לאלתר. That is, it must be for food, done by hand and not with a specialised utensil, and done immediately prior to consumption. But in fact the אוכל in that phrase refers to taking the אוכל - good - from the פסולת - bad, and not the other way around.

Or  any other melocha either.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal say you are allowed to cut open palm-weave baskets on Shabbos. These were disposable containers made of palm leaves, which were only used to ripen dates. Most Poskim explain that since this kli (vessel) had no intrinsic value it was considered batel (subservient) to its contents – the food inside, and thus one was permitted to cut it the same way you may break or tear the peel or shell of a fruit or nut.</p>\n\n<p>All  Poskim agree that breaking a worthless peal or shell-like container is not considered the melocha of tearing. This principle extends to sugar or drinks in cartons, as well as plastic bags and the thin foil covers on top of yogurt or another such packing that will be destroyed and thrown out. </p>\n\n<p>There are many questions in the Poskim as to practical applications of this principle <strong>so ask your LOR</strong> but one thing is clear:</p>\n\n<p>You may not do melacha for food on Shabbos. Some types of opening and simultaneously destroying packaging is not a melacha to begin with.</p>\n\n\n",

So first, to restate the specific points enumerated from the OP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>is Hashem indeed speaking L'H, and</li>\n<li>is this only permissible because he is God, and</li>\n<li>is this a case we shouldn't try and emulate Hashem?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is general teaching found within both the written and oral Torah that G-d keeps all His commandments. This is based upon <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.147.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya%7CQuoting&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 147:19</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He issued <em>His commands</em> to Jacob, <em>His statutes and rules</em> to Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This same theme is also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.6a.17?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 6a</a> in the name of Rabbi Yitzchok who asks where is it written that G-d wears tefillin.</p>\n<p>And so, just as we have a commandment prohibiting speaking Lashon HaRa, so too does G-d. But while some of us may stumble in this mitzvah, G-d does not.</p>\n<p>And this answers points 1 and 2 from the OP. No, G-d is not speaking Lashon HaRa because He keeps His commandments and because that first premise is incorrect, point 2  also falls away.</p>\n<p>The 3rd point in the question is more general.  The OP postulates from point 2, if <em>G-d</em> is speaking Lashon HaRa against Sarah in the Parsha quoted and then follows to ask in point 3 is this an example where we shouldn't follow G-d's behavior?</p>\n<p>In truth, a more careful reading of the Torah text is needed. The Torah discussing G-d's interaction with Avraham and Sarah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.9-15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 18:9-15</a> is actually via His angels, not G-d directly. So strictly speaking, this story is really asking should we emulate this type of behavior in regard to dealing with His Angels.</p>\n<p>But if we deal with what the OP actually asked, the general Torah teaching is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.3.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 3:6</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In <em>all your ways</em> know <strong>(meaning connect, as in cleave with)</strong> Him, And He will make your paths smooth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which teaches that we should emulate G-d's behavior and teaching in all areas, like is expressed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.3.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Proverbs.3.6.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudat David</a> to this posuk in Mishlei.</p>\n<p>And if the side issue from this question is considered, namely should we behave with G-d's Angels in the way that is taught here in the Torah?</p>\n<p>The response would be yes. But what the specific teaching is here, as it relates to interactions with Angels, is a more complex subject. This would fall into the area discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.3.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim's commentary</a> to the same posuk in Mishlei which distinguishes between the broad general <em>ways of G-d</em> and the more specific <em>paths of wisdom</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>First, trying to put God into some kind of frame or set of rules that he must obey feels, IMHO, like - if I'll put this in polite words - big misconception.</p>\n\n<p>Having that said, this question is still valid since <em>Lashon Hara</em> causes harm, so why would God will this to Sara?</p>\n\n<p>I guess that telling this to Abraham will have some kind of benefit, on the long run, so it's not immoral.</p>\n\n<p>That reflects on <em>Lashon Hara</em> rules. Telling <em>Lashon Hara</em> is not forbidden when the speaker means to make the person that he talks about to repent, and he assumes that telling his bad deeds will help this goal. (<em>Shmirat Halashon</em> rule 10:3-4).</p>\n\n<p>We all speak <em>Lashon Hara</em> with our spouses about our children, and with our fellow teachers about our students (when necessary).

This would cause their children to be influenced as they grow up and they would therefore not become worthy of Hashem's blessing or to inherit the status of Avraham and Yitzchak. Once the future wife comes and settles in Avraham's household, she would learn the ways of Hashem and become assimilated into his household.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that the people in Padan Aram, though idol worshipers still maintained morality. As a result, the woman from Padan Aram can learn to worship Hashem and to connect the (correct) morality that she had learned as a child to the worahip of Hashem. Thus, she will be able to raise her children to follow the ways of Avraham and Yitzchak. Indeed, we see that even with this care, Yitzchak and Rivkah still failed with Eisav who followed the ways of his uncle Lavan.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Abraham rejected the daughters of Canaan, and wished for a girl\n  from Aram for his son, we must remember that in Aram too, the people\n  were idolators. So that his reason must have been, not the idolatry of\n  Canaan but only the moral degeneracy of the land. Idolatry is\n  primarily an error of the mind, an intellectual error, which can be\n  corrected and cured. But moral degeneration gets a grip on the whole\n  nature of a person, on the whole depth of his feelings and thoughts,\n  and there, even an Abraham could not hope to find a modest, morally\n  pure, innocent girl for his son, who would bring with her the nobility\n  of fine feelings and morals, as a pearl for his home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Actually, as the Malbim points out, Avraham does <strong>not</strong> ask Eliezer to go to his family.</p>\n<p>The original directive was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי אֶל־אַרְצִי וְאֶל־מוֹלַדְתִּי תֵּלֵךְ וְלָקַחְתָּ אִשָּׁה לִבְנִי לְיִצְחָק<br/>\nBut go to my land, to my birthplace and take a wife from there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IOW: Get away from the land of Canaan and go to my home town.

The game plan was to go to the well, find a family so poor that they had to send their little girls to draw water and then woo the family with Avraham's enormous wealth.</p>\n<p>That's why the water-drawer was rewarded with an expensive set of jewelry: a golden nose-ring weighing a half-shekel, and two gold bands for her arms, ten shekels in weight</p>\n<p>But the plan misfired when Rivka insisted on going to the well that day, instead of the maid. וְהִנֵּה רִבְקָה יֹצֵאת. The word הִנֵּה always denotes a surprise.</p>\n<p>Once Eliezer discovers this, he changes the story; I need a family member - and that's why I only gave her the jewelry after asking for her identity. And then he pressures them - no worry, if you don't like the idea I'll go to other branches of the family; Lot or Yisma'el.

Whilst it obvious to me that a human being cannot relate to the infinite, it also seems that a belief in G-d’s infinity also makes relating to His self-revelation impossible too. After all, one cannot relate to something one regards as a mere appearance or ‘emanation’. To be blunt, my faith is on the rocks: I want to relate to G-d as Father and Lord but cannot square those attributes with His attribute of infinity.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Whereas I, in contrast, think that it's G-d's very infinitude that makes revelation possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a class of 5 students, the teacher can pay attention to each student. If we up the number to 10, there typically still isn't a problem. But class sized of 25 or 30? At some point you're talking about college lectures, where the teacher just puts a \"one size fits all\" message out there, with nothing specific to any one student. In a college class of dozens, most of their names will even go unknown.</p>\n\n<p>It is the fact that G-d is Transcendent that gives Him the \"Time\" and \"Patience\" to \"Attend\" to each of us.</p>\n\n<p>And I think this is why the name of G-d that denotes Divine Transcendence, Y-HV-H, a contraction of Will Be, Is and Was, the name so tied to His Transcendence we don't even pronounce it, is the one our Sages say is used in stories in the Torah in which it is easier to see Divine Compassion.</p>\n\n<p>E-lokim, the Law Giver, Master of All Forces, is used in stories where Divine Justice is easier to pick out. But justice is one rule for everyone. Wholesale.</p>\n\n<p>Compassion is retail. Only the Truly Infinite could be \"Aware\" of each of us and give each of us what we need.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, your question seems to be more about the problem that forced me to write \"'Time'\" or \"Aware\" instead of just lower-case \"time\" without quotes.</p>\n\n<p>And as Hashem tells Moshe, \"A person cannot see Me and live.\"</p>\n\n<p>But that's not a denial of Divine Revelation; it's a denial of a person being capable of <strong>full</strong> revelation. It doesn't mean we cannot experience a human-sized slice of His Reality.</p>\n\n<p>After all, there is a huge difference between Moses' prophecy and experiencing G-d in our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Although Maimonides said what you are asking for is indeed impossible. That the most a human can comprehend about G-d, other than His Action, is what He isn't. When we say G-d is everywhere we really mean that the concept of location has no relevance. Similarly, Omnipotence doesn't mean infinite power, but that the events G-d causes to happen within the created universe(s) isn't through power, so finite power is a non-issue. </p>\n\n<p>But fortunately, if you need some kind of experiential relationship with G-d, Maimonides isn't the only word on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>We pay a huge penalty for the fact that our brain and our heart aren't always in sync. Many times we make decisions we logically know are dumb, but we cave in to desire or the short-term.</p>\n\n<p>But here, that disconnect has a payoff. Our intellects can know all about and agree with Maimonides' despiction of G-d, and yet still on the experiential level we can relate to a Personal G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Even if that Personhood may be more something G-d is doing for our benefit than His True Inherent self. But analyzing that split... That's where Qabbalah begins.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While we accept God's Infinity and Transcendental existence as theological truths, we also see that in the Torah God is presented as close and accessible, almost anthropomorphic.</p>\n<p>The Torah is not coming to teach us abstract truths, but to teach us how to relate to God and His Ways.

You may have beheld God directly in Nature or perceived Him in history. Holy Writ may have spoken to you as it did to generations before you in its God-revealing narratives. But you may have grasped all this only with your mind and stored it in your memory. This is not enough. So long as you do not receive God into your heart as <em>your</em> God, and embrace Him with your whole being as your God, so long as this concept is a mere denizen of your brain, so long will this sovereign idea be without influence on your actual life (1:2)</p>\n<p>But above all, the most vital lesson to lay to heart is that this One God is <em>your</em> God, and that you have acknowledged Him in order to <em>live</em> rightly....

And this is a simple matter and very desired, for the reason that it is impossible for creations like us to grasp all of the completeness of the creator may he be blessed, and like it is said (Job 11:7), \"Will you succeed in examining haShem, will you discover the limits of Shad-dai?\". And we will find, that everything that the creations can grasp, will not be even a droplet from the great sea of the Creator's completeness and his name be blessed.</p>\n<p>(לג) אמרה הנשמה - זה פשוט אצל כל חכמי לב, וכבר נאמר (תהלים קו, ב), \"מי ימלל גבורות ה'\" וגו':</p>\n<p>(33) Said the Soul - This is simple before any who are wise of heart, and it already says (Psalms 106:2), \"Who will tell the great actions of haShem...\":</p>\n<p>(לד) אמר השכל - עתה כשנשיב אל לבנו כל סדרי מעשיו ית', כל המעשה הגדול אשר עשה מני שים אדם עלי ארץ, וכל אשר הבטיח לנו לעשות ע\"י נביאיו הקדושים, הנה מה שמתברר לנו מכל זה בירור גמור - הוא עוצם יחודו יתברך. ותראי שכל שאר מעלות שלמותו הבלתי בעלת תכלית אינם מתבררים אצלנו כלל, שאין בנו כח להשיג אותם. דרך משל, ידענו שהוא חכם, אבל לא השגנו סוף חכמתו; ידענו שהוא יודע, ולא השגנו ידיעתו. ועל כן אמרו ז\"ל (תפלת אליהו, תיקוני זוהר, הקדמה שניה), \"אנת הוא חכים, ולאו בחכמה ידיעא, אנת הוא מבין, ולאו בבינה ידיעא\". וכיון שאין אנו יכולים להשיג המעלות האלה, נמשך לנו מזה איסור החקירה בהם, כי על כל כיוצא בזה נאמר (חגיגה יג. בשם בן סירא ג, כא), \"במופלא ממך אל תדרוש, במכוסה ממך אל תחקור\"; וכן אמרו (ספר יצירה, פרק א), \"אם רץ לבך - שוב למקום\":</p>\n<p>(34) Said the Intellect - Now that we have returned to your hearts the order of HaShem's actions may he be blessed, All of the great actions He has done since placing man upon the earth (Job 20:4), and everything that her promised us to do through the holy prophets, behold that which is clear to us from this with complete clarity - is the might of His singularity may He be blessed. And you will see that all of the other characteristics of his completeness which is without limitation, are not clear to us at all, because we do not have the strength to grasp them. By example, We know that he is wise, but we cannot grasp the ends of his wisdom; we know that he is knowing, but we cannot grasp his knowledge. And therefore the Rabbis may their memory be blessed said (Prayer of Eliyahu, Tikunei Zohar, second introduction), \"You are wise, and not with knowable wisdom, you are understanding and not with knowable insight\", and since we are unable to understand these characteristics, a forbidding of examination of these emerges for us, for in regard to all like this it says (Chaggigah 13a in the name of Ben Sirah 3:21) \"In that which is beyond your comprehension do not seek, in that which is hidden from you do not examine\"; and similarly they said (Sefer Yetzira chapter 1), \"If your heart runs - return to your place\":</p>\n<p>אבל יחודו, אדרבא, זה מתגלה ומתברר לנו בירור גמור. ונמשך לנו מזה שלא די שהוא מתברר לנו, אלא שחייבים אנחנו להשיב אל לבנו הידיעה הזאת, לתקוע אותה בלבבנו בישוב גמור בלי שום פקפוק כלל. והוא מה שמצוינו משה רבנו ע\"ה מפי הגבורה (דברים ד, לט), \"וידעת היום והשבות אל לבבך כי ה' הוא האלהים בשמים ממעל ועל הארץ מתחת אין עוד\". ופי עליון מעיד בעצמו ומודיע כי כל הנלקט מכל מסיבותיו הגדולות אשר הוא מתהפך בעולמו, הלא הוא גילוי יחודו הגמור הזה; כענין אמרו (דברים לב, לט), \"ראו עתה כי אני אני הוא ואין אלהים עמדי\", ומקרא זה נאמר אחר שכלל כל סיבוב הגלגל, שהיה עתיד ומזומן להיות סובב בעולם, שנכלל הכל בדברי השירה ההיא של האזינו, וכמו שפשטן של כתובים עצמן מוכיח, והנה חותם החזון שלו חתם בלשון הזה, \"ראו עתה כי אני אני הוא\" וגו'. ובדברי הנביא ישעיה נתבאר בהדיא (ישעיה מג, י יא), \"למען תדעו ותאמינו לי ותבינו כי אני הוא, לפני לא נוצר אל ואחרי לא יהיה. אנכי אנכי ה' ואין מבלעדי מושיע\"; וכמו שכתוב (ישעיה מד, ו), \"אני ראשון ואני אחרון ומבלעדי אין אלהים\"; וכמו שכתוב (ישעיהו מה, ו ז), \"למען ידעו ממזרח שמש וממערבה כי אפס בלעדי אני ה' ואין עוד. יוצר אור ובורא חשך עושה שלום ובורא רע, אני ה' עושה כל אלה\". והנה \"למען ידעו\", \"למען תדעו ותבינו\" כתיב, משמע שרוצה שנדע בידיעה והבנה. ותכלית כל ההצלחה שהוא מבטיח לישראל הוא התברר יחודו לעיני הכל. ודבר זה נזכר פעמים אין מספר בדברי הנביאים ע\"ה (ישעיהו ב, יא), \"ונשגב ה' לבדו ביום ההוא\"; (זכריה יד, ט), \"והיה ה' למלך וגו' ביום ההוא יהיה ה' אחד ושמו אחד\"; (צפניה ג, ט), \"כי אז אהפוך אל עמים לקרוא כלם בשם ה' לעבדו שכם אחד\". וסוף דבר, הלא זה עדותנו בכל יום תמיד (דברים ו, ד), \"שמע ישראל ה' אלהינו ה' אחד\":</p>\n<p>But His singularity, is just the opposite, it is revealed and clarified focus in complete clarity. And it emerges for us from this that it is not enough that it be clear to us, but that we are obligated to return this knowledge to our hearts, to embed it in our hearts completely settled without any doubt. And this is what we were commanded by Moshe our teacher may he rest in peace from the mouth of The Mighty One (Deuteronomy 4:39), \"And you shall know today and return to your hearts that HaShem He is the G-d in the heavens above and on the earth below, there is no other\". And the mouth of the One on high himself testifies and informs us that everything that is gathered from all the great occurrences that He overturns in his world, is it not the complete revelation of this - His singularity; as it says (Deuteronomy 32:39) \"See now that I, I am He and there is no other G-d with me\", and this passage is said after He included all the future revolutions of the globe that are planned to occur in the universe, that include everything in the words of this song of HaAzinu, and like the straightforward meaning of these writings themselves prove, and behold the ending of His vision ends with this language, \"See now that I, I am He\" etc. And in the words of the prophet Isaiah it is described explicitly (Isaiah 43:10-11), \"In order that you know and believe me and understand that I am He, before me no G-d was created and there will be no other after me. I, I am hashed and there is no savior other than me\"; and as it is written (Isaiah 44:6), \"I am first and I am last and there is no G-d other than me\"; and as it says (Isaiah 45:6-7), \"In order that you know from the the east and the west that there is nothing other than me, I am HaShem and there is no other. The maker of light and creator of darkness making peace and creating the negative, I am hashed the maker of all of these\". And behold, it is written \"In order that you know\", In order that you know and understand\", meaning that He wants us to know with knowledge and understanding. And the purpose of all of the success that He promises to Israel is the explanation of His singularity to the eyes of all. And this matter is mentioned innumerable times in the words of the prophets may they rest in peace, (Isaiah 2:11), \"...and haShem will be exalted on that day.\"; (Zechariah 14:9) \"And haShem will be king [on all the earth] haShem will be one and His name will be one\"; (Zephania 3:9) \"For then I will overturn the peoples to all call in the the name of haShem and to worship him as one accord\". And in the end, is this not always our testimony every day (Deuteronomy 6:4) \"Hear O' Israel HaShem our G-d HaShem is One\":</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize, God wants us to understand Him, but this is impossible because of His infinity. The only aspect of His that we can correctly perceive is His Oneness. And that is presented to us and made clear over the course of history, with the end of the process being that His Oneness will be made perfectly clear to all of mankind.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we are not supposed to relate to God's infinity, for that is beyond us. We are supposed to try to fathom, through much thought and effort, that He is the absolutely singular Power in the world. (See the continuation; the quote is already too long.)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, do authorities say, e.g., a \"<em>shehakol</em>\" over a bowl of soup at a dining room table, with only \"<em>stam daas</em>\" (no explicit intent) exempts even a subsequent drink  of water from a kitchen sink?  Does it make a difference if the eater himself goes to the adjacent room vs. a server brings it to the table - assuming we are avoiding the problems of outright <em>hesech hadaath</em> / <em>shinui maqom</em> (distraction / changing of place, that would terminate the effect of a blessing) e.g. by staying within eyeshot of the  place of blessing?</p>\n\n\n",

(I don't know about America).</p>\n\n<p>How this phenomenon can be <em>theologically</em> explained at large (from Torah's viewpoint)?</p>\n\n<p>(I already suggested \"צדיק ורע לו\" <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/109804/does-%D7%A6%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A7-%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A2-%D7%9C%D7%95-principle-apply-to-a-nation-as-a-whole\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Torah specifically tells us not to \"forget\" God (i.e., become less observant) when we become wealthy and feel satisfied, implying that this is an expected phenomenon. [Deut.8]  That's how we are wired.  We just have to fight it.  That danger is also recognized in later Sources.  The Talmud [Berachot 32a] connects the sin of the Golden Calf with the fact that God encouraged the Israelites leave Egypt with much gold:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus spoke Moses before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of the Universe, the silver and gold which You showered on Israel until they said \"Enough\" -- <em>that</em> it what led to their making the [Golden] Calf.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A 19th-century Austrian sage, Rav Avraham Shaag, made investments and became wealthy, then sold everything, saying, “I am afraid my grandchildren will become wealthy.  The dangers of wealth far exceed the dangers of poverty.”</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it doesn't have to be that way.  The Talmud recounts the story of a rich rabbi who lived as a pauper while studying Torah [Yoma 35b].  In the Mishna, Rabbi Yonatan said: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He who fulfills the Torah in poverty shall in the end fulfill it in wealth. He who disregards the Torah in wealth shall in the end disregard it in poverty. [Pirkei Avot 4:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This quote neatly sets up a perpetual motion machine through the generations:  First poor and observant, then rich and observant, then rich and non-observant, then poor and non-observant, then back to poor and observant.  Our very survival seems to depend on this pendulum swinging back and bringing some of our people back into the fold.</p>\n\n<p>Note that “wealthy” does not mean “bad” in Jewish tradition.  It just has pitfalls. \n Wealthy people can and do accomplish a lot.  Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak of Lubavitch said: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wealthy people are self-confident, have high self-esteem, are expansive, arrogant, and ridicule the poor.  Poor people have little self-confidence, are contrite, broken, disheartened and self-deprecating.  Among these ten characteristics are the finest of virtues and the worst of faults. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't think this assumption behind this question is correct.</p>\n\n<p>The atheistic communist countries certainly were/are significantly worse off materially than the more religious capitalistic countries.</p>\n\n<p>As far as Bnei Brak  vs.  Tel Aviv goes, the people living in Bnei Brak  would tell you that they are voluntarily giving up Olam Hazeh for the sake of Olam Haba.

And Bnei Brak does have a longer life expectancy than Tel Aviv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's not that the non-religious are rewarded with wealth.

And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep His commandments, or no. And He afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. And thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him. For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, springing forth in valleys and hills; a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless the LORD thy God for the good land which He hath given thee. Beware lest thou forget the LORD thy God, in not keeping His commandments, and His ordinances, and His statutes, which I command thee this day; lest when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that He might afflict thee, and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; and thou say in thy heart: 'My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.' But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God, for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore unto thy fathers, as it is this day. And it shall be, if thou shalt forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I forewarn you this day that ye shall surely perish. As the nations that the LORD maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This however says nothing about cooking the meat, and I'd like to know whether meat absolutely has to be cooked for Jew or Noachide? If nothing was specifically said, I would consider this an endorsement of eating raw meat, and that perhaps HaShem meant for this to be this way.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, do we know if any significant religious figures considered of high moral character under the Auspices of HaShem, Jewish or Noachide, stretching from Genesis Chapter 9 to the Renaissance, that fundamentally consumed their meats raw?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question of rare and raw meat <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/7904/1713\">has been asked</a> on this site before.

For example, אור - or - light means the light that completely erases the darkness as in Bereshit 1:3. However, there is also light אורה - orah - a weaker light which only illuminates darkness, like a light of a candle, as in Megilat Ester 8:16.</p>\n<p>Based on this idea we have to say that the real מעון, the permanent dwelling of Hashem, is on the Most High, while the one in Tziyon is but a tiny copy of it despite its glory. Hence the change to feminine מעונה.</p>\n<p>The word סוכו, as G-d's temporary dwelling from the word סוכה can be understood from the desert tabernacle. I posit that by analogy, Tanach is using male gender when it seeks to describe a grand version of something small. What is a succah? It is a dwelling with a schach, i.e. a covering which allows to see through it. The tabernacle and the Jewish desert encampment were covered by Clouds of Glory. These clouds served as a glorious schach for Hashem himself, looking at the Jewish people down from Shamayim (as we sing on Yamim Noraim ואתה ניצב בשמים), providing for them mann and water, keeping clothing intact, and protecting them in every possible way in the desert. Hence the male gender. I.e. the verse poetically hints to a comparison of the simple but lofty experience in the desert to the glorious but lowly Temple realization many years later.</p>\n<p>Finally, because the verse uses the name Shalem, i.e. Yerushalaim, for the tabernacle, perhaps it seeks to imply due to shechinah resting on the 600,000 or other large number residents of Yerushalaim there is still the same effect of succoh as it was in the desert.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is explained by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.76.3?lang=he&with=Malbim&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim to this posuk in Tehillim</a> who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ויהי בשלום סוכו,</strong> בירושלים ששם ישבו ההמון, שם היה סוכתו של ה', שהסוכה היא דירת עראי,</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ומעונתו בציון,</strong> בציון שם ישבו המלך והסנהדרין וכהני ה', שם היה מעונתו בקביעות כי שם היה מקדש ה' :</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That the usage of <em>sukkah</em> in this connotation is the congregating place of the entire mob of people, both men and women. There is no order to it and all are mixed. That it why it refers to the whole city of <em>Shalom</em> (related to completeness, <em>shleimut</em> and also to Jerusalem).</p>\n\n<p>But with the <em>Ma'on</em>, there is a specific order and arrangement. In that place are all the leaders (the King), and the Judges (the Sanhedrin), and those who administer to G-d (the Kohanim). They sit in a specific and desired order. It is referring to Har HaBayit.</p>\n\n<p>This change to the feminine is relating to the concept that in terms of the system of the sephirot, the side pertaining to <em>Gevurah</em>, which is about judgement, discernment, division, etc., is associated with the specific, arranged places for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>This same principle is emphasized in the <em>Zimone</em> of Grace after the meal for a wedding where the leader says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נברך אלקינו שהשמחה במעונו שאכלנו משלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This usage of Ma'on is to emphasize that in this special meal, the men and women are careful to sit separately, in the proper, fixed order.</p>\n\n\n",

This seems very plausible; G–d surely did not create that skin without assigning a purpose to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Shelah HaKadosh, the garment that Adam HaRishon wore was made from the skin of the Leviathan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we accept that Midrash as being factual, we can much better understand the statement that in Rabbi Meir's version of the Torah the word Or in Kotnot Or was spelled with the letter א, light.

Every person, according to his degree, gets a bit of the skin of Leviathan. Only those that fulfill mitzvos out of love for G-d and with no other motives, will get rewarded in the form of a \"full Leviathan skin\". - to be honest, I do not know how to interpret this.

Adam was buried by Seth his son there.  </p>\n  \n  <p>אָמַר רַבִּי רְחוּמָאי, הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא נִתְעַסֵּק בּוֹ כְּשֶׁנּוֹצָר, וְנִתְעַסֵּק בּוֹ כְּשֶׁמֵּת. וְלֹא הָיָה מִי שֶׁיּוֹדֵעַ בּוֹ, עַד שֶׁבָּא אַבְרָהָם אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ עָלָיו הֲשָׁלוֹם, וְנִכְנַס לְשָׁם, וְרָאָה אוֹתוֹ, וְהֵרִיחַ רֵיחַ בְּשָׂמִים שֶׁל גַּן עֵדֶן, וְשָׁמַע קוֹל מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת אוֹמְרִים, אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן קָבוּר שָׁם, וְאַבְרָהָם יִצְחָק וְיַעֲקֹב מוּכָנִים יִהְיוּ לַמָּקוֹם הַזֶּה. רָאָה הַנֵּר דּוֹלֵק, וְיָצָא. מִיָּד הָיְתָה תַּאֲוָותוֹ עַל הַמָּקוֹם הַזֶּה.    </p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Rechumi argued that G-d himself buried Adam so no-one knew of the existence of the entrance until Abraham entered there, saw and smelt the aroma from Gan Eiden. The Angel said Adam is buried here and Abraham Isaac and Jacob will be Buried here. Abraham desired to be buried there.   </p>\n  \n  <p>אָמַר רַב הוּנָא, קוֹדֶם שֶׁבָּא אַבְרָהָם, רַבִּים הָיוּ מְבַקְּשִׁים לִיקָּבֵר שָׁם, וּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת הָיוּ שׁוֹמְרִים הַמָּקוֹם, וְרוֹאִים אֵשׁ דּוֹלֶקֶת שָׁם, וְלֹא יָכְלוּ לִכְנוֹס, עַד שֶׁבָּא אַבְרָהָם וְנִכְנַס, וְקָנָה אֶת הַמָּקוֹם.    </p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Huna said until Abraham came many that wanted to be buried there but the angels guarded the cave from them, they saw a fire and couldn't get in.  Until Avraham managed to enter in his greatness, he bought the Cave to be buried there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8218/showrashi/true#v3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Sarah 23:3-4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3 And Abraham arose from before his dead, and he spoke to the sons of\n  Heth, saying</p>\n  \n  <p>4 \"I am a stranger and an inhabitant with you.

[Consequently, I have no\n  ancestral burial plot here (Rashbam, Sforno).] And the Midrash Aggadah\n  (Gen. Rabbah 58:6) [states]: If you are willing [to sell me burial\n  property], I am a stranger, but if not, I will be as an inhabitant and\n  will take it legally, for the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me, “To\n  your seed I will give this land” (above 12:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out on verse 3 the source for the law of <em>onein</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>he only left his dead to make arrangements for it; hence our sages lay\n  down the law that as long as the dead be unburied; the relative is to\n  think of nothing else than attending to the business of seeing that\n  the dead receives its due. Until the burial is duly carried out, this,\n  and nothing else at all, is to receive all his attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch continues on verse 4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abraham does not ask for permission just to bury his wife. He wants\n  his wife to rest in her permanent everlasting possession of her\n  resting-place, that is why he first asks for the right to acquire a\n  piece of land as freehold property for the purpose of a sephulcre.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch continues on verse 19 that this particular location is requested because it was also the burial place of Adam and Eve, the progenitures of all mankind and, therefore, had a particular holiness. The cave (Machpelah - doubled) had locations for pairs to be buried so that he would be buried with Sarah. There were other pairs so that Yitzchak and his future wife and the heir of Yitzchak and his future wife could also be buried there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therein lies the thought that the particular place where it was wished\n  that the burial was to be made had special value for the one who was\n  to be buried there, or for those who belonged to him. It says that he\n  is not just to be buried, but to be buried there. Now tradition says\n  that Sarah was not the first to be buried in that cave. Adam and Eve\n  already rested there. The parents of mankind were the first and they\n  are to be joined by the parents of the Jewish people, those spiritual\n  parents of mankind, that was why Abraham chose just this cave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Genesis.23.20?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim (footnote to 23:20)</a> explains that Avraham wanted to demonstrate to the Bnei Ches the truths of the soul's continued existence and its eventual resurrection. (That requires, then, that the deceased be buried with their own family and with people of their caliber - אין קוברים רשע אצל צדיק. If that weren't the case, there'd be nothing wrong with a temporary burial just to get the dead body out of the way, and then eventually disinterring it.)</p>\n\n<p>That he wanted specifically the Me'aras Hamachpeilah, the Malbim goes on to explain, is because its structure - בית ועליה על גביו - represents the human being in this lower world, with Olam Haba above it.</p>\n\n\n",

So the man went and sowed after the first rain with the result that everyone else's crop was blighted and his was not blighted.  Said his wife to him: How is it that last year everyone else's crop was smitten and yours was not smitten, and this year everyone else's crop is blighted and yours is not blighted? So he related to her all his experiences. The story goes that shortly afterwards a quarrel broke out between the wife of that pious man and the mother of the child, and the former said to the latter, Come and I will show you your daughter buried in a matting of reeds. The next year the man again went and spent the night in the cemetery and heard those conversing together.

Sherira Gaon, Rebbe intentionally did not include additional baraisos, because \"he did not want to produce a lengthy order, which had a danger of having its details being forgotten. Mishna was relatively short and people could memorize it then.

I'm definitely not ridiculing it.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>An answer that is blatantly obvious to an insider\n(e.g. \"<em>Because cooking meat and milk together is not kosher.</em>\")\nsounds like it is begging the question and leaves an outsider none the wiser.</p>\n\n<p>What seems like a simple question can sometimes require a great deal of background information to answer properly,\nsometimes even several thousand years of history.\nThis is one of those questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Being Irish (and west Ireland too), you were almost certainly raised Catholic and are familiar with the term \"Pharisee\",\nthough you might not know its real meaning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Pharisees were a social movement and a school of thought in the Holy Land during the time of Second Temple Judaism.\n  After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism.\n  — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharisees - Wikipedia</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Pharisees were not members of the priesthood, but were a social group with a strong belief in holy scripture\nand a strong feeling of what was right and wrong.\nThey were respected by the general population as educated and moral people.</p>\n\n<p>The Pharisees saw a pattern in the history of Israel, which had been chosen to present a moral example to the world (\"the chosen people\").\nWhenever the nation's king (and as a result the people) followed the Lord's commandments and laws, the country prospered,\neasily defeating enemy attacks and living in peace and prosperity.\nWhenever the nation's king (and as a result the people) followed the ways of their pagan neighbours, the country eventually suffered,\nat times even being taken away in captivity as slaves.</p>\n\n<p>They realized that the path to peace and prosperity, and to fulfill their purpose, was to ensure that the nation always behaved correctly.</p>\n\n<p>But almost all rules can have fuzzy boundaries.\nPerhaps someone is following the rule but it looks like they aren't.\nAnd sometimes one can break a rule while not appearing to do so.\nSimilarly one can follow the spirit of the law but not the letter, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>So the Pharisees developed an expanded set of rules, which, if followed, would guarantee without any doubt\nthat one was also following the Lord's rules.\nThese rules were exaggerated, were overkill, but they accomplished their purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Secular society does a similar thing today with many of its laws.\nThe purpose of a traffic stop-sign is to inform those approaching it that cross traffic has right of way over them,\nand that they should wait until there is an appropriate break in traffic to allow them to safely cross or turn.\nBut the law requires that each vehicle come to a full stop before proceeding; that the wheels <em>can be seen</em> to stop rotating.\nBy the spirit of the law, there is often no need to actually stop, as the intersection can be clearly seen and there is no traffic\nin the area, but the letter of the law still requires that the vehicle's wheels stop rotating.</p>\n\n<p>A similar but more extreme situation is with a traffic light.\nMany times a driver will sit waiting for what seems like a very long time, until a red light eventually changes to green,\neven though there would be no physical danger in simply driving through the empty intersection.\nBut if they don't wait, the driver could receive a ticket for breaking the law even though what they did was perfectly safe and reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>The Pharisees became what could be considered morality police, encouraging citizens to follow their rules to the letter,\nthereby ensuring that the underlying sacred laws would also, without the slightest doubt, be followed.</p>\n\n<p>This system, with the priests proclaiming the sacred laws, and the Pharisees instructing people how to live their lives, worked well,\nwith most people going along with it and believing it to be the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But, seeing the Jews as a potential threat, in the year 70CE the Roman military destroyed the great Temple and the priesthood,\nand deported most of the citizens throughout their empire (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish diaspora - Wikipedia</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Wherever the people resettled, they formed small communities to preserve their culture.\nThe priesthood no longer existed, at least not in any form resembling what it had been.\nBut there were still many Pharisees, with great historical and religious knowledge, who became the new religious leaders.</p>\n\n<p>They were no longer known as Pharisees, simply retaining the title \"rabbi\", which meant \"teacher\".</p>\n\n<p>Over the following centuries, the rabbis educated their people, and rabbinical schools were formed\nto train and educate the next generation of rabbis and to further study, understand, and develop the rules that governed Jewish life.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>With that background, the original question can be answered.</p>\n\n<p>In ancient Israel, one of the surrounding pagan nations practiced a fertility ritual:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was a custom of the ancient heathens, when they had gathered in all their fruits, to take a kid and boil it in the milk of its dam;\n  and then, in a magical way, to go about and besprinkle with it all their trees and fields, gardens and orchards; \n  thinking by these means to make them fruitful, that they might bring forth more abundantly in the following year.\n  — Clarke's Commentary</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Lord explicitly instructed the Israelites not to follow this practice: \"<em>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>Judaism interprets this as a specific case of a more general biblical law\nforbidding cooking mammalian meat and milk together.\nRabbinical tradition has extended this restriction to other similar meat,\nsuch as chicken, but not to obviously different flesh such as fish.</p>\n\n<p>The Pharisees and later the Rabbis needed to ensure that no one would do this, so they developed what today forms the dairy/meat\nrules of kosher food.\nIt's unarguably overkill, but if one can guarantee that no dairy product (including butter, cheese, etc.)\nand no meat product (even chicken) are ever cooked or even eaten together at the same meal,\none can guarantee that the original commandment is not being broken.</p>\n\n<p>There's no chance that someone could be cooking fish with milk and accidentally include a piece of goat meat.\nThere's no chance that someone could be cooking goat and accidentally add a milk-based sauce to it.</p>\n\n<p>These, and many other rules, have become an integral part of Jewish culture and religion.</p>\n\n<p>Even knowing the original commandment, to an outsider the practice makes little sense; but to an insider \"<em>Because cooking meat and milk together is not kosher</em>\" makes perfect sense.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Laws of inheritance according to the Torah still applicable?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was wondering if the inheritance Torah laws were still applicable in Western countries like US or France.</p>\n<p><strong>First question</strong></p>\n<p>For example, in France, by law a parent can not disinherit one of his children.\nIn this case, there is no possibility for a daughter to get nothing at the death of her parents. Yet according to the law of the Torah, she shouldn't receive any inheritance from her parents.</p>\n<p><em>Does the law of the land override halachic inheritance laws?</em></p>\n<p>This question may already has an answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92237/inheritance-laws-and-dina-dmalchuta-dina\">here</a></p>\n<p><em>Is there a difference in Israel and other countries?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Second (and most important) question</strong></p>\n<p>This rule is surprising today, when women do not occupy the same place as when these rules were enacted.\nPerhaps, the inheritance laws were related to the part of the land of Israel that should always remain in the same tribe?\nToday, it seems terribly unfair to deprive girls of their parents' inheritance. Jewish women, especially in the religious world, have enormous responsibilities; which was not the case at the time when these rules were established.</p>\n<p><em>Can we consider that inheritance laws no longer apply today, given that the situation has evolved enormously?</em></p>\n<p>My question has no provocative purpose, nor does it question the eternity of the laws of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Indeed the laws of Torah inheritance are still valid and, at the same time, many parents wish for their daughters and sons to inherit equally. Even in countries where the law of the land would make it illegal to follow Torah law, many still want to respect the letter of Torah law and structure a will that complies with both.</p>\n<p>Therefore, over the years, different mechanisms have evolved to allow for this while still respecting <em>halacha</em>. I have looked at this for our own will and found 3 mechanisms, often combined</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Setting aside a portion of one's estate to be transmitted to one's children according to Torah law</strong>, in order not to completely circumvent <em>halacha</em>. This might be a smaller amount (e.g., equivalent of 1000$ or 10,000$ depending on one's wealth) which gets transmitted to one's sons with the older one getting a double portion (see footnote 9 <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/weekly-halacha-5771-shoftim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for relevant sources and how to set the amount)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Gifting the rest of one's wealth to one's children a few minutes/hours before death</strong>, in any way one decides (often equally amongst children). This results in limiting the actual assets to be split according to Torah law to the amount in the previous point</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Since this most <em>poskim</em> require a <em>kinyan</em> (formal act of acquisition), mechanism 2 can only apply to possessions up to the time of writing the will (since a <em>kinyan</em> cannot acquire not-yet-existing assets). To circumvent this the father <strong>creates a large debt towards the daughter(s) which gets canceled if the son(s) agree to voluntarily follow the mechanism 2 above</strong> for all assets acquired after the will was signed</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All this is obviously best done under the advice of a competence adviser in Jewish law familiar with the laws of inheritance and the laws of the land. Some religious lawyers specialize in this area.</p>\n<p>Source: my own research before preparing our <em>halachic</em> will, but you can read excellent summaries (with a focus on US law, although it applies very well in Israel as well) <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/Halakhic%20Will.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/wills-halacha-no-need-compromise-either/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The laws of inheritance are specifically called by the Torah חוקת משפט, a statute of a law. The Gemara learns from this that the laws of inheritance are unchangeable, and even if a person expresses his desire for his daughter to inherit him, it has no effect unless a loophole is used (giving a gift to take effect <em>before</em> his death). Changing circumstances cannot change this either, and for the daughter to insist on her secular legal inheritance would constitute stealing from her brother.</p>\n\n<p>Of coarse it probably is appropriate to make a halachicly acceptable will in most cases, so that the daughters will be able to inherit. Also, by the way, bank accounts and institutional investments are more complicated because of the contracts involved.</p>\n\n\n",

After that, just apply the normal rules of techum surrounding the place where the eruv was placed.</p>\n\n<p>So if the eruv is outside of a city, he may not leave the 2000 amos surrounding that location, even if part of his city is outside that area. So suggestion #4 is correct. If you place an eruv within your city, it as the same as if you didn't place one at all. You may walk throughout the city and 2000 amos from the edges.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason for the specification of the amount is to show that the fee is fixed for the entire period specified rather than as a rent of 100 <em>zuz</em> per year. This makes it easier for the Mishnah to show the difference rather than using the term <em>a fixed fee</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>22</strong> The landowner need not leave the land in the renter's possession for another year to compensate for the <em>sheviis</em> year, when\n  the tenant was not allowed to work on the field and profit from it.\n  Furthermore, since the rental agreement fixed the seven hundred <em>zuz</em>\n  fee for one septennial, rather than seven years, the owner need not\n  deduct a seventh of the rental for the <em>sheviis</em> year even though the\n  tenant cannot till the field that year (see <em>Nemukei Yosef</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishnah uses the example of a rental fee of seven hundred <em>zuz</em> to\n  teach that there is no implication that the fee was based on a\n  calculation of one hundred <em>zuz</em> per year. Rather the seven hundred\n  <em>zuz</em> was the fee for the entire period, which is understood to include only six working years (<em>Toras Chaim</em>; see also <em>Kos Ha\n  Yeshuos</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>23</strong> If the rental agreement stipulated \"seven years\" [rather than one septennial], the implication is that the lease is for seven\n  working years. Therefore the owner must leave the field in the\n  tenant's possession for an additional year in lieu of the <em>sheviis</em>\n  year when he could not work. (see <em>Meiri</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Since it was a <em>pikuach nefesh</em>, he borrowed from Achav, who would only lend at interest.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, I learned that the miracle was done particularly because Ovadyah provided oil for these people, -- in other words, bread and water were basic necessities, but oil was only needed for comfort since they could have learned by heart. So for providing that which he was not as obligated to provide, Ovadyah merited a miracle which is described in Melachim II 4 at length.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know the source for this idea, as I am sure I heard it from some rav or read in a good <em>sefer</em>, but cannot recall the source for that idea.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.4.2?lang=he&p2=Malbim_on_II_Kings.4.2.1&lang2=he&w2=all&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> mentions it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>,<strong>כי אם אסוך שמן:</strong> ופי' חכמינו זכרונם לברכה שעובדיה היה מדליק תמיד שמן לבני הנביאים אשר בלילה לא יכבה נרם, ראוי שיהיה נס בשמן:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, he quotes \"Chazal\" but I see nobody else mentioning it.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.4.7?with=Radak&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> says something along these lines in the name of the Tosefta.

    "content": "# If you're well-hydrated at the start of a fast, can you keep drinking water throughout the fast? If not, why not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Generally speaking, when the Torah is discussing the concept of fasting, whether on individual fasts or public fasts, it mentions the prohibition of <em>neither eating, nor drinking</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But water has a special status in terms of being considered in the category of a  <em>drink</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Water has no taste or scent which appears to be the physical distinction delineated in Torah (halacha) as found for example in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&st=&pgnum=602\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav,volume 1, 202:15</a> (citing the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.205.2?lang=bi&with=Turei%20Zahav&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Turay Zahav to Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 205:2:5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>And in fact, like is mentioned in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&st=&pgnum=666\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Birchot HaNehanin, Chapter 1, halacha 1</a> that according to the Sofrim all eating and drinking requires a blessing beforehand <em>if one benefits/takes pleasure</em> in it.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, water does not receive a blessing before it or after it because it has no taste or scent, unless one is drinking from being <em>parched</em>. If one is not parched, water is not considered to be a drink <em>in the halachic sense</em>. Like is mentioned in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&st=&pgnum=695\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Birchot HaNehanin, Chapter 10:7</a>. If one is not parched, then no blessing is made. This is in spite of the fact that one swallows it.</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the question.</p>\n\n<p>If one is properly hydrated prior to the commencement of a fast, private or public, so that they are not parched, is it permitted to drink water intermittently throughout the fast? Is it still considered to be fulfilling the mitzvah?</p>\n\n<p>This is assuming that one abstains from all eating and drinking of all other beverages.</p>\n\n<p>If not, why not. Please provide clear sources.</p>\n\n\n",

Since it is his home (usually, or it's his current abode) they have to follow him.</p>\n\n<p>But, in shul, he doesn't have the \"power\" to prevent others from saying Tachanun, so they ignore his presence.</p>\n\n<p>A Chattan and Mohel, on the other hand, do have the \"power\" to prevent others from saying Tachanun. Probably because everybody wants to join in the Simcha. </p>\n\n<p>I guess nobody asked the Aveil to come to shul and they have no intention of joining in his mourning. (Actually, he's not even allowed to come to shul unless he can't gather a Minyan at home.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If an Aveil is in Shul during the month of Nissan when Tachanun is not said, or if an Aveil is in Shul on Rosh Chodesh when no Tachanun is said, then no Tachanun is said by all, remains the rule. The rule of saying Tachanun when an Aveil is present is only that an Aveil does not make the Shul not say Tachanun. Thus in the case of a Chassan and an Aveil being present no Tachanun would be said by anyone.</p>\n\n\n",

Why doesn't the Kallah veil herself? Wouldn't the minhag follow the Pasuk better if this were the case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I've heard that the custom originated as a \"preventive measure\" for the situation where Ya'akov ended up marrying Leah when he was supposed to have married Rachel. Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.29.25.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rash\"i in Breishit 29:25</a>. Ya'akov knew that Lavan was a swindler so he told Rachel to use certain signs so that he could identify her at the wedding. However, when she saw that her father was presenting Leah to Ya'akov, she didn't want her sister to be embarrassed if Ya'akov discovered that she didn't know the signals, so Rachel quickly told them to Leah.</p>\n<p>So, now, when the chattan approaches the kalla, he verifies that the kallah is actually the correct person. It is possible that the Yiddish באַדעקן is related to the Hebrew <em>bodek</em> which means \"to check\" or \"verify\".</p>\n<p>I will add a better source a bit later.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Not everyone agrees that it must be performed by the Chosson. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch writes that it should be the most prominent people of town who spread the veil. Both customs are cited in Dagul Mervava (YD 342)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המנהג במדינות אלו בנשואי בתולה <strong>שחשובי העיר</strong> פורסין סודר על ראש הכלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the reason cited in the question, there would be no reason for the Chosson himself to do it. However, other reasons are cited in the Poskim for Bedeken, which would require specifically the Chosson. One reason is based on position in the Rishonim (See Tosfos Rid Kiddushin 3, and Tosfos Yuma 13b - based on Kiddushin 18b) that the definition of Chuppa is 'פורס טליתו עליה'. Some Poskim (see Drisha §65) understand that this is the purpose of 'Bedeken'. Accordingly, it must be the Chosson who does so. [Whether this is consistent with our custom to perform Bedeken before the Kiddushin - insinuating a Nissuin prior to Kiddushin, see Mishne Lemelech Hil. Ishs Chapter 10]</p>\n\n\n",

I believe the idea is that a sukkah and chuppah both show a closeness and protective environment. With regards to sukkah we had such a protection from Hashem. By chuppah it is the man who is bringing his wife into his chuppah as a resemblance of closeness and protective element. The Ramban brings the passuk of Yeshayahu 4:5 which describes the chuppah(ananai hakavod type description - which is what sukkah was according to one opinion.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text of Ramban (English translation courtesy of Sefaria):</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"I made the Israelite people live in booths. Rashi's comment seems to me to be the straightforward sense of the verse. He has commanded that all future generations should know the deeds of the great God \"Who dealt so wondrously with you\" (Joel 2:26) sheltering them under the clouds of His Presence as in a booth. <strong>Having already explained that \"over the Tabernacle a cloud of the LORD rested by day, and fire would appear in it by night\" (Exodus 40:38), our verse needed only to say, \"I made the Israelite people live in booths\" - \"I made My Presence into clouds of glory as shelters to protect them.\" We find the same notion in Isaiah 4:5-6, \"The LORD will create over the whole shrine and meeting place of Mount Zion cloud by day and smoke with a glow of flaming fire by night. Indeed, over all the glory shall hand a canopy, which shall serve as a pavilion for shade from heat by day and as a shelter for protection against drenching rain.</strong>\" At the beginning of the dry season, we are commanded to remember the exodus by making Nisan the first month of the year, and by celebrating the festival of Passover; here, at the beginning of the rainy season, a further observance is commanded, in commemoration of the ongoing miracle that was done for them throughout their 40 years in the wilderness. According to the opinion that the phrase refers to actual booths, they did begin making them at the start of the rainy season because of the cold, as people do when they camp, and that is why our text commands that booths be made at this season. In that case, what the future generations are supposed to know is that they made their way in the wilderness and \"found no settled place\" (Psalms 107:4) for 40 years. But God was with them, and they \"lacked nothing\" (Deuteronomy 2:7).\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text of Ramban in Hebrew (Sefaria):</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>כי בסכות הושבתי את בני ישראל ענני כבוד לשון רש\"י והוא הנכון בעיני על דרך הפשט כי צוה שידעו הדורות את כל מעשי ה' הגדול אשר עשה עמהם להפליא ששכן אותם בענני כבודו כסוכה כענין שנאמר (ישעיה ד ה ו) וברא ה' על כל מכון הר ציון ועל מקראיה ענן יומם ועשן ונגה אש להבה לילה כי על כל כבוד חפה וסוכה תהיה לצל יומם מחרב וגו' ומפני שכבר פירש שענן ה' עליהם יומם ועמוד האש בלילה</strong> אמר סתם כי בסכות הושבתי שעשיתי להם ענני כבודי סכות להגן עליהם והנה צוה בתחילת ימות החמה בזכרון יציאת מצרים בחדשו ובמועדו וצוה בזכרון הנס הקיים הנעשה להם כל ימי עמידתם במדבר בתחלת ימות הגשמים ועל דעת האומר סכות ממש עשו להם (סוכה יא) החלו לעשותן בתחילת החרף מפני הקור כמנהג המחנות ולכן צוה בהן בזמן הזה והזכרון שידעו ויזכרו שהיו במדבר לא באו בבית ועיר מושב לא מצאו ארבעים שנה והשם היה עמהם לא חסרו דבר</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources that G-d miraculously and deceptively conceal His deeds\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the debate on veracity and historicity of the Biblical stories and claims many assert that after an event in discussion G-d miraculously wiped all evidence or replaced it to look natural.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>in the story of the Creation - G-d created everything at once in 6 days but then made it look like it happened in billions of years</p></li>\n<li><p>in the story of the flood - the whole humankind descended from Noach's 3 children, but G-d made the genetics look like we developed in millions of years</p></li>\n<li><p>in the story of Exodus, the narrative describes millions enslaved and eventually liberated conquesting the Holy Land, but G-d wipe out any empirical evidence <em>of this scale</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's not a big Chochmah to provide this excuse retroactively when we have overwhelming evidence, but I'm curious, in the times when the Torah stories were perceived literally, say before Rambam, is there any authoritative source that speculated that G-d does deceptive <em>correcting</em> miracles to conceal His deeds?</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: <em>This question only asks whether this approach has an earlier source or not, it does not deal with the justification or the refusal of the approach itself.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The general theme of AZ 54b-55a is “If Hashem hates idolatry, why doesn’t He just get rid of it?” One particular statement that’s relevant to the question at hand (my translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל רבא בר רב יצחק לרב יהודה האיכא בית עבודת כוכבים באתרין דכי מצטריך עלמא למטרא מתחזי להו בחלמא ואמר להו שחטו לי גברא ואייתי מטרא שחטו לה גברא ואתי מטרא א\"ל השתא אי הוי שכיבנא לא אמרי לכו הא מלתא דאמר רב מאי דכתיב (דברים ד, יט) אשר חלק ה' אלהיך אותם לכל העמים מלמד שהחליקן בדברים כדי לטורדן מן העולם והיינו דאמר ריש לקיש מאי דכתיב (משלי ג, לד) אם ללצים הוא יליץ ולענוים יתן חן בא לטמא פותחין לו בא לטהר מסייעין אותו:</p>\n  \n  <p>Rava bar Rav Yitzchak said to Rav Yehuda, “Why is there such a place of idolatry in our city where, when the world needs rain, it appears to them in a dream and says to them, ‘Slaughter for me a man and rain will come,’ and they slaughter a man to it and rain comes?” He replied, “Now, were I dead, I could not tell you the following teaching which Rav said: What is that which is written, ‘Which Hashem, your G-d, divided them (חלק) from the nations’? To teach you that Hashem slips them up (החליקן) with words to remove them from the world.” This accords with the statement of Reish Lakish: What is that which is written, “If toward the mockers, He will mock, but to the humble He gives grace”? One who comes to become impure, they open for him; one who comes to become pure, they assist him. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>For the short answer, see 1 Kings 22:20-23 and Yechezkel 14:9 regarding the use of what, at very least, we would usually identify as deception by God.</p>\n\n<p>Your question, as formulated, relies heavily on the idea that the Biblical stories transpired literally as described while the physical/material evidences (as represented by contemporary academic beliefs) are, as it were, falsified.  In much of the Orthodox world, however, it is believed that such evidence provides some justification to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/697/899\">interpret these passages non-literally</a>. Regarding a seven-day creation, I would not be surprised if most on a site such as this did not accept the story literally as it is found in the text. The question of deception is even more acute in this case because there is a presumption that we are to interpret the text literally (see how the Meforshim approach אֵין מִקְרָא יוֹצֵא מִידֵי פְּשׁוּטוֹ) and are only permitted to abandon the literal meaning upon finding evidence that the narrative is counter-factual (see Emunos v’Deos 7:2). God tells us what happens in the Torah and it is only through external information unknown for centuries that we are able to tell it wasn't meant literally (according to this approach).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the notion that the Earth was created to appear old, this is deceptive only when one doesn't think things through.  While the Torah obviously provides no information as to how old the earth appeared when it was created fully formed (see Rosh Hashannah 11a) the presence of countless features such as trees would give the impression of more time having transpired than the six-days of creation. Although it would be a sound inference to believe the Garden was older, such inductive reasoning would have to be revised when presented with more information (such as the testimony of the Creator).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Israelite's sojourn in the desert, any academic assessment of the historicity of the account will begin with the presumption that the miraculous elements are embellishments as a matter of methodology. That the B'nei Yisrael were fed a supernatural food with a supernatural shelf life (Ex. 16) or that their shoes and clothing did not wear out (Dt. 8:4) means that much of the material culture that we would expect to find as evidence was never produced in the first place, not that it was somehow deceptively concealed.</p>\n\n<p>Just because there is a conflict doesn't mean there is a contradiction.  Two of the examples you cited are real conflicts between the Torah narrative and academic science but, at least provided one has reason to believe the Torah account, they do not falsify them.  The idea that God could utilize deception is a theologically challenging one but there is some precedent suggesting this to be the case but it is not clear that your examples are the best available ones to probe this question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I never  heard anyone  say that \"G-d miraculously wiped all evidence\"</p>\n\n<p>The common explanation that I've heard is that the events being discussed were supernatural events. Therefore you will not find evidence for them by looking for them with natural current scientific means. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there was some sort of mechanism used for the world to transition between it's natural and supernatural states. But it wasn't that   \"G-d does deceptive correcting miracles to conceal His deed\"</p>\n\n<p>The are plenty of sources in the Torah about there being seemingly valid evidence against it. Not to answer this question but in a general sense. Starting with the Torah itself talking about a Novi Sheker performing real miraculous signs as a nisyon.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for Ralbag on G-d's knowledge\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does the Ralbag ever say that G-d does not know the future? I am aware that Ralbag writes that G-d only knows the generality of things but not the particular. Abraham ibn Ezra is of the same opinion. My question, however, is on G-d and the future. If we take Ralbag's view, is it correct to say that G-d generally knows the future of the species and the world as a whole but not every human per se?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Prophecy is not a good answer to this question since Rambam says it is natural. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Yes, Ralbag does say that God does not know (certain aspects of) the future. See Book III of Milchamot Hashem for his full treatment of God's knowledge. The basic idea is that God's knowledge of man's future actions is limited by man's free will. God knows what man will likely do, based on his makeup and the celestial influences, but man has the ability to choose to act differently from what God could have \"predicted\".</p>\n<p>Ralbag mentions this concept a number of times in his commentary to the Torah. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Genesis 18:20</li>\n<li>The Sixteenth Lesson there</li>\n<li>Genesis 22:1</li>\n<li>The Sixth Lesson there</li>\n<li>Exodus 3:11</li>\n<li>The Twelfth Lesson there</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is my full translation of the second example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sixteenth lesson is in ideas. And it is to teach us something amazing of God's knowledge of things, which was hidden from all [my] predecessors whose words have reached us. And it is that that which God may He be exalted knows of actions in this low world is independent of what man [actually] does. That is that He knows the actions of people that are fitting according to what was prepared for them from the day of their creation, based on the celestial causes that God may He be exalted placed as guidance over the human species. [However,] human choice rules over this arrangement of their actions based on the celestial causes. And it is therefore possible that what people actually do is different from what God  may He be exalted knew [they would do] based on the arrangement of their actions. And this is because He knows their actions from the side in which knowledge of them is possible, and that is the side in which they are arranged and quantified. But on the side in which they are contingent there can be no knowledge, for if we suppose that knowledge of them is possible then their contingency cannot be upheld. And therefore it says metaphorically that God may He be exalted saw whether the people of Sodom and Gomorrah actually did the evil that He knew from them, because it is possible that what they had done was different from what God may He be exalted knew from them. And we have explained this topic of God's knowledge of things in Book III of <em>Wars of the Lord</em>. And we explained there that this view is necessary on the basis of philosophy as well as on the basis of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/856/do-we-really-have-free-choice/114432#114432\">another post</a>, I argue that Rashi might have held a similar view.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

This is to make the dowry more similar to the standard practice from that time.

He asked me why he should be bothered practicing Judaism with its restrictions which don't speak to him as having any religious value. I would recommendations for books to read (either myself or him), podcasts to listen to or other media to consume which offers a non-intellectual based, teenage oriented  response to why someone should be an orthodox Jew. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One name that comes to mind is Zecharia Wallerstein. There are a tremendous amount of his speeches <a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/speaker?l=90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> on Torah Anytime.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard back from both kiruv organisers and the teenagers who needed that extra type of push that he has a successful approach that is appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>But as Yaakov said in the comments, not everything is about proofs and convincing. Sometimes it's just a matter of showing someone appreciation and support while they find their own way through those turbulent years. This is something Rabbi Wallerstein is known for.</p>\n\n<p>There is a great saying, apparently wrongly attributed to Samuel Clemens, which goes like this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kids will come to their senses eventually. Most kids, especially boys, have issues with authority in their teenage years. Unfortunately that restlessness translates into shucking off religious responsibilities too. Fortunately, they will come to their senses once they mature a bit. Luckily there is no kareis until 20, so by the time they come back there is little for them to worry about. \nHowever, by that time many feel they have no home or religion to return to, so they stay wherever they are religiously. That is our fault not theirs. </p>\n\n<p>Also remember the Bartenura in Avos. Knowing what to answer to an apikores does not apply to a Jewish apikores, as arguing with them will only send them further off. </p>\n\n<p>So, if I may offer a bit of advice, based on experience and the words of many people who spend a tremendous amount of time with children in these situations. The next time you see this teenager, instead of trying to prove God's existence and our duty to Him, just take the opportunity to say hi, how are you. This may take a tremendous amount of restraint on your part, but in most situations you will experience the results a few years from now.</p>\n\n\n",

And wherever his name is mentioned but not his father’s name, it is known that he was a prophet but not the son of a prophet.

(Otherwise this gets very dicey, very fast.)</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/106175/21\">stated about a similar situation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because Judaism allowed a man to have more than one wife, until a thousand years ago, technically a married man could go find another woman without breaking halacha, and thus the strictest halachic definition of \"adultery\" only concerns relations between a married woman and a man who's not her husband.</p>\n<p>Still, it should go without saying that for a married man to cheat on his wife is despicable, wrong, a violation to fellow human beings, and a sin to God. (At the bare minimum, all non-marital relations are prohibited.) The technical term \"adultery\" is not used, however.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably if the couple got divorced, the husband's infidelity would be considered when the assets are being divided.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, back to the theoretical prohibition for the act itself -- we'd fall back on if both of them were single (and let's assume it's clear their intent is purely promiscuous.) If the woman is a <em>Nida</em>, that's prohibited and theoretically punishable by <em>karet</em> -- G-d takes it up with their soul. If not, then it's theoretically punishable by lashes (either at the rabbinic or Biblical level, depending on which medieval interpretation we follow).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Sharon Galper Grossman describes the phenomenon you describe as happening occasionally in Israel in <a href=\"https://traditiononline.org/resolving-the-debate-over-human-pappiloma-virus-hpv-vaccination-for-cancer-prevention-in-the-religious-world/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a recent journal article about HPV</a>; in a subsequent letter to the editor, she acknowledged that maybe that wasn't the best thing to print.</p>\n<p>If the woman later remarries, her kesubah will say exactly the same thing whether she'd had relations with someone or not, simply identifying her as a divorcee (divorcees can never marry a kohen anyhow, so that point is moot).</p>\n<p>If she got pregnant from the union with the Jewish married man: if the father wasn't a kohen, then the child is a 100% kosher Jew with no special limitations whatsoever [because <em>theoretically</em> the parents could have married at the time]. If the father was a kohen, then the child was born of a forbidden union -- if it's a boy he is not a kohen, if it is a girl she may not marry a kohen.</p>\n\n\n",

Keep going back until you reach the time o the Gemorah. Just imagine what they must have been like.</p>\n\n<p>There is an old saying  \"Someone who thinks he can argue with Abaya is an apikorus. Someone who thinks he can argue with the Rashba is an idiot\" </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p><strong>Possible sources for the theory of the decline of the generations</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is possible that the source for the idea of the decline of the generations, as made plain in the question, could be attributed to the Chazon Ish, which insists on the need to follow the majority, however, the Sanhedrin is longer functioning and the Sefer HaChinnuch does not extend to include the rabbinic authorities of every generation, and the position of the Sefer HaChinnuch is a minority view at best. Not to mention that the criteria required therein are generally not fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deuteronomy 17:11 and “right and left”</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Another possible source could be from Rashi's commentary to Deuteronomy 17:11, where Rashi states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“even if he [the rabbi] tells you regarding the right [hand] that it is left, or regarding the left that it is right, and certainly so [you must obey the rabbi] if he tells you regarding the right [that it is] right, and regarding the left [that it is] left.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Put differently, Jonah of Gerona (Ran), writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“even if it is crystal clear to you that what the court [or rabbi] tells you is wrong, nevertheless obey them, for this is how G-d, may He be blessed, commanded that we should behave towards the Torah and its commands: do as they decide for us, whether it is true or false.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They are quoting Deut. 17:11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Do not stray right or left from all that they tell you\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why Rashi cites a Midrash, \"Even if they tell you that right is left and left is right, you must listen.\" </p>\n\n<p>But Deuteronomy 17:8–13 it talking about the authority of the levites, priests, and judges when they are baffled. It does not refer to an erroneous rabbinical opinion, it refers to judicial verdicts, requiring litigants to accept the verdict.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“you shall carry out the verdict … observing scrupulously all of their instruction to you…. You must not deviate from the verdict that they announce to you either to the right or to the left.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A classic example of this can be found in the Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 2:9 where the Patriarch Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua calculate the date for Yom Kippur differently. Although Rabbi Joshua eventually consented, he did not do so because he felt Gamaliel was right. He did so as a means to avoid division in Judaism. Joseph Albo, writer of Ikkarim was of the same opinion when he interpreted Deuteronomy 17. Another reason why Deuteronomy 17 does not refer to the rabbis is that the rabbinical institution did not exist until 70 C.E.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when Rashi draws his sources from the Midrash Sifrei, “even if they [the rabbis] teach you clearly” – Rashi paraphrases – “concerning right that it is left and concerning left that it is right obey them.” </p>\n\n<p>But the Jerusalem Talmud, Horayot 1,1 seems to state the opposite: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You would think that if they [the rabbis] said to you concerning right that it is left and concerning left that it is right you should obey them, therefore the Torah tells you to go right and left: if they tell you concerning right that it is right and concerning left that it is left [then you obey them, but not if they tell you that right is left].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash remarkably omits the words, “You would think” and, “you should listen to them.” Rashi is copying an erroneous statement. Thus, the Midrash contains a scribal error!</p>\n\n<p>However, it is possible that Rashi was aware of the Talmudic view and only addresses the Midrash as an opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Nachmanides quotes Rashi and Sifrei, but takes one more step, writing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“execute this innocent [a person I know is innocent]” because the Torah “commanded that I perform all His [G-d’s] commandments in accordance with all that they who stand before Him [the rabbis] … teach me to do. He gave me the Torah as taught by them, even if they were to err.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus obedience is imperative. G-d places the words into the rabbi's mouths as he does the Pope. This is illogical, indeed anti-rational, as it leads people to say that the Pope is infallible and only made two mistakes in the history of Catholicism. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Yisachar Eilenberg, the author of Tzedah laderech contends that Sifrei and Rashi are focusing on a situation where a person hears a rabbinical decree but is unsure whether they are right or wrong. But that the Talmud is focusing on the circumstance in which a person knows a rabbi is mistaken, and must not agree with him.  This is reasonable. Jacob Makelberg, author of Hakhatav v’hakabala is of the same opinion.</p>\n\n<p>An example of this is Rabbeinu Avraham ben HaRambam who felt that the sages were not infallible when it came to science, for example, Rabbi Yaakov Rischer dismissed the scientific claim that the earth is round on the grounds that the Talmud's position is that the world is flat. Even the Chazal were incorrect when it came to science as clearly demonstrated in Rabbi Slifkin's works.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen two approaches thus far. But there is a third approach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides think?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In his Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Mamrim 1:2, Maimonides writes about Deuteronomy 17 concerning rabbinical laws but avoids the discussion of “right and left” altogether in the Mishneh Torah. In his Guide of the Perplexed he writes that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“A man should never cast his reason behind him, for the eyes are set in front, not in the back.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, Maimonides agrees with the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have seen three approaches to interpreting Deut. 17:11. The first approach insists on blind acceptance despite the error of the rabbis. The second suggests that a person should only accept a rabbinical pronouncement if they are unsure of the material out of hand. But they should not accept a rabbi if he seemingly says that black is white or right is left, and if they know he is wrong. The third approach, the position of Maimonides, states that a person should always use their reason, even questing tradition such as medicine. </p>\n\n\n",

It prohibits actions not thoughts (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/68094/are-thoughts-of-sin-punished-halachically\">halacha - Are thoughts of sin punished halachically? - Mi Yodeya</a> for nuances on this).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other Commandments are concerned with actions (idolatry, murder, theft, adultery, etc.), while the tenth is about coveting, which is a mental attitude, not an action.</p>\n\n<p>Does the original Hebrew include something beyond the common English meaning of the word \"covet\"?</p>\n\n<p>If not, why is this tenth Commandment so different from the others?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nFrom the answer to the duplicate question, it seems to me that in this case \"covet\" means something that in the extreme cases would range from making someone feel uncomfortable to outright extortion. So there is in fact an action against another person, albeit not necessarily overt. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written [in the Book of Micah]: “They covet fields and (then) steal them.” [Micah 2:2]  And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. [Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Gezelah v’Avedah 1:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Rambam views “Do not covet” as a protective fence that avoids a cascade of infractions.  For example, coveting your neighbor's wife might lead to murder of her husband.  If the adultery is not known and leads to a child, the father is misidentified, and the child does not get to inherit from his real father, which is a form of theft.  The child does not get to honor his real father, which breaks another commandment.  If the matter is known, the child is tagged as a bastard, and may marry only another bastard.  If he can't find one, he cannot marry, which means fewer Jews to observe Shabbat and commandments.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Talmud makes clear that, while coveting is forbidden, there is no punishment for it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[There is no punishment for mere evil intention], for it is said [in the Book of Psalms]: “If I saw iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear.” [Ps. 66:18]... [If evil] intention does not [lead to action], the Holy One, blessed be He, does not [punish it]. [Kiddushin 40a] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud also says we can refrain from coveting by not looking into our neighbors’ affairs:  If two people share the same courtyard, each can force his neighbor to build a wall in the middle so neither can look into the other's half.  [Bava Batra 2a]</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra holds that it's all a matter of training children since their youth, and THERE is the implied action behind the commandment.  He writes that a person does not desire to lie with his mother, although she may be beautiful, because he has been trained since his youth to know that she is forbidden to him.  He does not desire non-kosher meat just as we Westerners do not desire snake meat or fried ants:  It's a psychological result of our training. Proper education can regulate improper coveting.  As it says in the Book of Proverbs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Train a child in the way that he should go, and even when he is old, he will not depart from it. [Prov. 22:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, if we wasted time wishing for what we don't have, we would not spend as much time appreciating what we do have, and may even lose it.  The Talmud says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever sets his eyes on what is not his, loses also what is his. [Sotah 9a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Their dispute is recorded in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.10b.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> 10b - 11a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא <strong>רבי אליעזר אומר בתשרי נברא העולם</strong> בתשרי נולדו אבות בתשרי מתו אבות <strong>בפסח נולד יצחק</strong> בראש השנה נפקדה שרה רחל וחנה...‏</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Eliezer says: In Tishrei the world was created</strong>; in Tishrei the Patriarchs were born; in Tishrei the Patriarchs died; <strong>on Passover Isaac was born</strong>; on Rosh HaShana Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered by God and conceived...</p>\n<p><strong>ר' יהושע אומר בניסן נברא העולם</strong> בניסן נולדו אבות בניסן מתו אבות <strong>בפסח נולד יצחק</strong> בר\"ה נפקדה שרה רחל וחנה...‏</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees and says: In Nisan the world was created</strong>; in Nisan the Patriarchs were born; in Nisan the Patriarchs died; <strong>on Passover Isaac was born</strong>; on Rosh HaShana Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered by God and conceived sons...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can see from this <em>baraisa</em>, they both agree that Yitzchak was born on Pesach (since Sarah conceived on Rosh Hashanah).</p>\n<p><strong>Rav Chaim Kanievsky</strong> <em>shlita</em>, in his <em>sefer</em> <strong>LeMachseh Atik</strong> to <strong>Genesis</strong> 21:2, brings a dispute as to when Yitzchak was born. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Seder Olam</strong> Chapter 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Vayera.17.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Midrash Tanchuma</strong> <em>Vayeira</em> § 17</a> say Pesach, yet the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.151a.43?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Zohar</strong> III <em>parshas Beha’alosecha</em> p. 151a</a><sup>1</sup> says he was born on Rosh Hashanah.</p>\n<p>His final comment is that this dispute is the same dispute found in <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> 10b between R' Eliezer and R' Yehoshua. Yet, as shown above, they both agree on this point! He even cites <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> 11a as a source that Yitzchak was born on Pesach (although he writes עי' ראש השנה, not sure his intention there...).</p>\n<p>How can this be resolved?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9UqUD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9UqUD.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the sefer\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: See the comments of the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?&pagenum=124&book=170552\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Turei Even</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37956&pgnum=160\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Poras Yosef</strong></a> (פור\"י ד\"ה בתשרי נולדו), and <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14416&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Aruch LaNer</strong></a> (ד\"ה בתשרי מתו) to 11a, where it is clear they understood the <em>gemarra</em> to be saying <strong>everyone</strong> agrees that Yitzchak was born on Pesach.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Not sure if this helps but the <em>sefer</em> cites p. 302b, but on Sefaria there is no p. 302b.

In the gemara, R' Eliezer agrees that Yitzchak was born in Nissan, but not according to the Zohar. That would be simpler than saying the Zohar is a brand new opinion.</p>\n<p>When he writes עי' ראש השנה, he is saying see there for the differences. This is a common way for writers to acknowledge there are complicating sources without getting further into the discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

It is possible that they were born from one pregnancy and Gad's form was completed after 7 months (as hinted to by numerical value of Gad [gimmel=3 + dalet=4} - 7), and Asher's form was completed after nine months.

You might say 3 Amos, like a Mikve - you're wrong\" etc. It doesn't make sense to me. I assume the passing of the oral law was pretty much straightforward - a Rabbi tells his students what he knows, so Moses told Yehoshua - \"the minimum height is exactly 10 Tefochim, no less and no more.\"</p>\n\n<p>It appears that this method is specific for the Babylonian Talmud, I don't see it being used in Midrashic literature for example.

But those measures are pretty loose, around 20% of freedom.</p>\n\n<p>What object or usage, in our Halacha, requires the finest (most precise/exact) measurement, like \"2 Amah and 2.549 Etzbah\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Actually, many of those measurements are precise!</p>\n\n<p>(So, rather than answer your question, I wish to explain how it is based on a wrong assumption.)</p>\n\n<p>In terms of how far one may walk on Shabbos, or how far one may carry something outside an eruv, one uses one's own ammah. Measure from your elbow to the tip of your middle finger. That's your ammah.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, my oldest son who is 6'2\" is permitted to walk further from the city than his 5'3\" dad can.</p>\n\n<p>Where these body-based measures become imprecise is when the halakhah has to be applied to a community. </p>\n\n<p>So, taking eruv for an example... Eruv is an interesting case because it is one halakhah that uses the ammah two different ways. A wall in an eruv cannot have a 10 ammah gap, so when it comes to a gaps, bigger measures are a leniency. A lintel (mavui) must run 4 amos to count as a \"form of a doorway\" (tzuras hapesach), and can't be 20 amos high. So that long measure would also be a stringency in length, but a leniency in height.</p>\n\n<p>In a single eruv, the definition of ammah must be consistent.</p>\n\n<p>More that that, according to the Rashba, the Ritva, and probably Rashi, each law has to be consistent, not just each situation. In other words, all our eruvim must use the same amamah -- even if for one eruv, the larger ammah is a leniency (eg it has gaps) and for another, larger is a stringency (eg the poles are close together). </p>\n\n<p>So, for that eruv lintel, or for sukkah, one consistently uses a narrower estimate. But, since in kelaim (the laws of not planting crops together) most times wide measuring would be the more stringent, one always uses wide measures in kelaim.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.363.32-35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arukh haShulchan Orakh Chaim 363:32-35</a></p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: the imprecision appears to boil down to demographics -- no two people are alike, but we often need one halachic ruling across an entire community.</p>\n\n\n",

We need these people, these atheists, whom seek to befriend.”[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, atheism is a good path to rational religion (though not the only one).</p>\n\n<p>[1] Religious Zionism of Rav Kook by Dr. Pinchas Polonsky </p>\n\n<p>[2] Essay by Rabbi <a href=\"https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/12/17/hitchens-atheism-and-rav-kook/amp/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Alan Brill</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am an Italian Noahide.</p>\n<p>My opinion is that, from a halachic point of view, idolatry is an overall more serious violation than atheism.</p>\n<p>Both violations, in fact, determine the exclusion of the offender from the World to Come (see Rambam's Mishneh Torah- Hilchot Teshuvah chapter three); however, as far as this world is concerned, the Halakhah provides for the death penalty for idolatry, but does not seem to me to establish any penalty for the profession of atheism, which violates the first precept of the Torah, \"I am Hashem, your Supreme Authority\" (Exodus 20:2), violation for which however I do not detect any earthly sanction, but only, as mentioned, exclusion from the World to Come.</p>\n<p>In this respect, there is no difference between Jews and non-Jews; the latter are excluded from the World to Come in case of atheism (see again Hilchot Teshuvah above), but they are commanded, in this world, not to serve idols; in fact a Noahide Tribunal is not legitimated to sanction atheistic conduct, but only idolatrous conduct (see Rambam's Misheh Torah- Hilchot Melachim chapter nine).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in my opinion, atheism does not refer to the violation of the prohibition of blasphemy, which has its foundation in Exodus 22.27: \"Do not curse God\"; in his Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Avodah Zarah chapter two, Rambam states that:</p>\n<p>\"Whoever accepts a false god as true, even when he does not actually worship it, disgraces and blasphemes [God's] glorious and awesome name. This applies both to one who worships false gods and to one who curses God's name [as is obvious from Numbers 15:30]: \"If a person commits [an act of idolatry] highhandedly, whether he be a native born [Jew] or a convert, he is blaspheming God.\"</p>\n<p>\"These are the laws which govern a blasphemer: A blasphemer is not liable to be stoned to death until he states God's unique name, which possesses four letters: א-ד-נ-י, and curses that name with one of the names of God which are forbidden to be erased, as [Leviticus 24:16] states: \"One who blasphemes God's name....\"</p>\n<p>It does not seem to me that, on the basis of the aforementioned halachot, a public declaration of atheism can be included in this crime, lacking the halachic prerequisites</p>\n\n\n",

And so is it considered Theft or Adultery to learn Biblical Hebrew? Is reading in Biblical Hebrew considered a level of learning Torah that is prohibited to gentiles?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading my question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The Talmud Sanhedrin 59a rules that it is prohibited for non-Jews to study Torah. But there was one rabbi who fought for equality. He took a universal approach, saying that since Torah is objectively true, we should teach Torah to non-Jews, as Abraham had done when he welcomed strangers to learn in his tent. The ruling ruled against his motion. But he may have been right. Some rabbis (I forget the source) said that it is possible that a Sanhedrin ruling could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the Mishnah Rosh Hashanah 2:9 Rabban Gamaliel and the sage Rabbi Joshua calculated the dates for the holiday of Yom Kippur differently. In the end, Rabbi Joshua consented not because he was wrong but because he wanted to prevent division in Judaism. (The mandate of Deuteronomy 17 does not refer to the rabbis).</p>\n\n<p>True, the Torah was a covenant with Abraham. Yet, G-d's truth is not inclusive. Indeed, the great Jewish sage and philosopher Moses Maimonides \nwrote that \"The truth is the truth no matter what its source.\" He, therefore, had no quarrels accepting the philosophy of the Greek Pagan Aristotle. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, Jews should learn the truth from whoever speaks it, and the same applies to gentiles. If truth really is the Torah, why are we preventing them from hearing G-d's message?

Since we have concluded that non-Jews can and should read the Bible, we should now be asking ourselves can they read it in Hebrew? But the real question we should be asking is what is holiness?</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish poet Halevi wrote that the Jewish language, Hebrew is superior and holy because it is Jewish. Rabbi Ishmael disagreed. He felt that the Bible was written for people who needed to understand it and that it was written in the way that people think and talk, in human terms, not divine, language. It follows that the Hebrew language is not inherently holy. Can the soil turn holy? Is the Bible “holy”? No. Holiness is not an ingredient.</p>\n\n<p>Neither land nor any other object is holy; holiness is the result of proper action regarding the self, land, or object. Nothing is holy per se. The term holiness only comes into effect when people use these things in a proper way. Holiness is the result of actions. The Shabbat is only holy if you keep it. The Torah is certainly holy if we read it and practice its enactments as the rabbis explained them. Maimonides stressed that Israel is only holy when Jews live there. It follows that prayers do not have to be recited in Hebrew and may even be recited in an abridged version. </p>\n\n<p>Although the best way to understand the Bible is to read it in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To see another answer regarding the nature of holiness, please click <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/109113/17072\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

That these three things, to act justly, to love kindness, and to follow the Torah with humility are what G-d wants.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't read more into it and say that they are relayed in order of importance. All are equally important as life would never require you to choose one over another. You could do all three at all times. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the gemara (Sukkah 49b, translation and interl), this clause refers to interpersonal mitzvos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיינו דא\"ר אלעזר מאי דכתיב (מיכה ו, ח) הגיד לך אדם מה טוב ומה ה' דורש ממך כי אם עשות משפט ואהבת חסד והצנע לכת עם אלהיך עשות משפט זה הדין ואהבת חסד זו גמילות חסדים והצנע לכת עם אלהיך זו הוצאת המת והכנסת כלה לחופה והלא דברים ק\"ו ומה דברים שדרכן לעשותן בפרהסיא אמרה תורה הצנע לכת דברים שדרכן לעשותן בצנעא על אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is what Rabbi Elazar said: What is <em>the meaning of</em> that which is written: “It has been told you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord does require of you; only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8)? “To do justly”; this is justice. “To love mercy”; this is acts of kindness. “To walk humbly with your God”; this is <em>referring to</em> taking the <em>indigent</em> dead out <em>for burial</em> and accompanying a <em>poor</em> bride to <em>her</em> wedding canopy, <em>both of which must be performed without fanfare. The Gemara summarizes:</em> And are <em>these</em> matters not <em>inferred</em> a fortiori? If, <em>with regard to</em> matters that tend to be conducted in public, <em>as the multitudes participate in funerals and weddings,</em> the Torah says: Walk humbly, <em>then in</em> matters that tend to be conducted in private, <em>e.g., giving charity and studying Torah,</em> all the more so should they be conducted privately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To answer your second question, I wrote a book on the topic (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/36l6DmW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Widen Your Tent, Mosaica, 2019</a>), based on Rav Shimon Shkop's wordview as described in his introduction to Shaarei Yosher.</p>\n\n<p>Here are Rav Shimon's opening words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יתברך הבורא ויתעלה\n  היוצר שבראנו בצלמו\n  ובדמות תבניתו, וחיי\n  עולם נטע בתוכנו שיהיה\n  אדיר חפצנו, להיטיב עם\n  זולתנו, ליחיד ולרבים\n  בהוה ובעתיד בדמות\n  הבורא כביכול.</p>\n  \n  <p>Blessed shall be the Creator, and exalted\n  shall be the Maker, Who created us in\n  His “Image” and in the likeness of His\n  “Structure,” and planted eternal life\n  within us, so that our greatest desire\n  should be to benefit others, to individuals\n  and to the masses, now and in the future\n  in imitation of the Creator (so to speak).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Translation from Widen Your Tent, pg 45, also available <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/ShaareiYosher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>This justifies much of halakhah, like respecting elders, property laws, etc... Hashem gives us the rules that only His Wisdom can be sure would be of real benefit as opposed to what we think is beneficial, to the as many people as possible in a given situation. But the role of ritual halakhos requires further explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shimon continues by defining qedushah, holiness, as consecrated to Hashem's purpose to benefit others. And rest and recreation have a place in a holy life:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה כשהאדם מישר\n  הליכותיו ושואף\n  שתמיד יהיו דרכי חייו\n  מוקדשים להכלל ,אז\n  כל מה שעושה גם\n  לעצמו להבראת גופו\n  ונפשו הוא מתיחס גם\n  כן אל מצות קדושה,\n  שעל ידי זה יטיב גם\n  לרבים...</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold, when a person straightens his\n  path and strives constantly to make his\n  lifestyle dedicated to the community,\n  then anything he does even for himself,\n  for the health of his body and soul, he\n  also associates to the mitzvah of being\n  holy. For through this he can also benefit\n  the masses. (pg 48)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, the role of mitzvos bein adam laMaqom, those between a person and Hashem, as explained in the same terms:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועל פי דרך זה ענין מצוה\n  של פרישות הוא תמצית\n  מיסוד מצות קדושה,\n  הנכרת בפועל בדרכי\n  ההנהגה של האדם, אבל\n  ברעיון ושאיפת הרוח\n  מתרחבת מצוה, זו גם\n  על כל מפעליו ומעשיו\n  של האדם גם בינו\n  לבין המקום</p>\n  \n  <p>And based on what we have explained,\n  the thesis of the mitzvah of avoidance\n  is essentially the same as the underlying\n  basis of the mitzvah of holiness, which\n  is practically recognizable in the ways\n  a person acts. But with insight and\n  the calling of spirituality, this mitzvah\n  broadens to include everything a person\n  causes or does even between him and the\n  Omnipresent. (pg 49)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My taking an esrog or putting on tefillin is only qadosh because I need that spiritual nourishment to be capable of being of maximal benefit to others</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>for my own sanity,</li>\n<li>to have the necessary discipline to make holy choices rather than those driven by desire and ego, and</li>\n<li>to know what Hashem's Good looks like, rather than trying to figure out what would benefit others without their Maker's input.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How much is Rabbi J.D. Bleich's exegesis about Targum Onkelos on Deuteronomy 23:18 really shared in the Jewish tradition?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm an Italian Noahide. The issue in question manifests my purely intellectual interest, concerning the Jews and not the Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>In Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Part II, Chapter XIII The Prohibition against Intermarriage 42 , Rabbi Judah David Bleich says :</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(…)Deuteronomy 23:18: \"Lo tiheyeh kedeshah mi-benot Yisra'el ve-lo\n  yiheyeh kadesh mi-benei Yisra'el.\" This passage is rendered in\n  standard English translation as \"There shall be no harlot of the\n  daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of\n  Israel”. Rashi, following one opinion presented in Sanhedrin 54b, does\n  indeed understand the term \"kadesh\" as referring to a male prostitute\n  who makes himself available for homosexual activity. Rambam, Sefer\n  ha-Mizvot, lo ta'aseh, no. 350, records the latter part of this verse\n  as an injunction against homosexual relations. However, this passage\n  was not universally understood in this manner by Jewish exegetes.\n  Rambam, Hilkhot Ishut 1:4, understands the first section of this verse\n  as establishing a prohibition against fornication. Sexual intercourse\n  between unmarried persons constitutes a violation of this commandment\n  according to Rambam. Targum Onkelos translates this verse as follows:\n  \"No Jewish woman of the daughters of Israel shall marry a slave and no\n  male of the children of Israel shall marry a female slave.\" Rabbi\n  Maharam Schick and others point to the fact that the verse in the\n  original Hebrew does not specify cohabitation with a slave. They\n  observe that Targum Onkelos speaks of a slave simply as an example of\n  the type of sexual liaison to which reference is made. Instead of\n  rendering a literal translation the Targum offers an example of a\n  sexual relationship between individuals who cannot be united in\n  matrimony with the implication that all comparable relationships are\n  likewise included in the prohibition. Fornication between an unmarried\n  male and an unmarried female does not fall within the scope of this\n  prohibition according to theTargum because such persons are eligible\n  to contract a valid marriage. The prohibition, for the Targum, is\n  limited to a situation in which matrimony is halakhically precluded\n  but includes cohabitation between any male and female who are\n  halakhically incapable of contracting a valid marriage. A liaison\n  between a Jewish male and a non-Jewish female slave or between a\n  Jewish woman and a male slave is merely an instance of such a\n  relationship”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Bleich therefore, Targum interprets this precept of the Torah in the same way as the exegesis conducted on this passage by Nachmanides (see Critique of Sefer HaMitzvot; negative prohibition 355).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Israel Drazin, author, together with Rabbi Stanley M. Wagner, of an English translation of  Targum Onkelos published by Gefen Publishing House,however  disagrees with Rabbi Bleich's opinion on the meaning assumed by the version of the Targum on this precept. This is what Rabbi Drazin says:</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Deuteronomy 23:18 A woman of the daughters of Israel shall not become\n  the wife of a slave, and no man of Israel may marry a bondwoman.</p>\n  \n  <p>A WOMAN…BONDWOMAN. Onkelos entirely rewrites the Torah’s “No\n  Israelite\n  woman shall be a kedeishah, nor shall any Israelite man be a kadeish.”\n  Ibn Ezra and Radak understand Scripture’s kedeishah and kadeish as “a\n  readiness,” people ready to prostitute themselves with sex. However,\n  since the basic meaning of kadosh is “distinct” and “set aside,” this\n  may be the basis for the term of these cult prostitutes. Why did our\n  targumist rewrite this verse into an idea that the Bible does not seem\n  to suggest? The answer may lie in the definition of kedeishah and\n  kadeish. The targumist may have felt that a woman becomes a kedeishah,\n  “separated” from all other Israelites, if she marries a male slave;\n  and a man does so if he marries a female slave, because by joining the\n  slaves, they have given up their dignity and, perhaps, for the female\n  Israelite at least, her status as a free Israelite . Nachmanides views\n  our verse in a different manner. He suggests that Scripture is warning\n  courts to eliminate prostitution, whether by males or females. This\n  teaching is in the Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 68a, 69a, and\n  Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Issurei Biah 2:13.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why did the Onkelos rewrite verse 18? Several ideas beyond those in\n  the commentary have been suggested: Aberbach and Grossfeld (in Targum\n  Onkelos to Genesis) point out that Onkelos’s interpretation may have\n  been influenced by the fact that in talmudic times there was no\n  conceivable danger of Jewish cult prostitution. Churgin (Halakhah,\n  page 92) suggests that our targumist did not translate this verse\n  according to its plain meaning, but speaks about the prohibition\n  against marrying a slave, in order to censure the Hasmonean family for\n  marrying into the family of Herod, a descendant of slaves. Melammed\n  (Bible Commentators, page 197) believes the targumist may be\n  reflecting a lost Midrash. Schefftel (Biure Onkelos) states that the\n  biblical language is subject to several interpretations, but since the\n  targumist wrote for popular consumption, he includes a reading that\n  would be most meaningful to the people. Pseudo-Jonathan has “You must\n  not profane your daughters to make them harlots, nor may any man of\n  Israel debase himself by fornication.” Neophyti and the Septuagint are\n  literal, rendering the two words as “female and male prostitute.” See\n  also Komlosh (Hamikra, page 166, note 4), where the literature on this\n  subject is cited, as well as the Babylonian Talmud, Keritot 3a and\n  Sanhedrin 54b.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>Taking into account the positions reported by Rabbi Drazin, I therefore ask you: how much is really shared in the Jewish tradition Rabbi Bleich's exegesis  about this version that Targum gives about Deuteronomy 23:18 ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Whether or not we accept Rabbi Bleich's views regarding the translation and the intent of Onkelos, we can note that rabbis often discuss and reflect opposing views throughout the Talmud. It is noteworthy here to say that both accounts (Drazin and Bleich) offer several interpretations and suggestions of the intent of Onkelos. Rabbi Israel Drazin seems to take Onkelos literally (I have note read Drazin's Onkelos series). He offers several commentators who suggest that the verse indicates probations for allowing Jews to marry slaves in the attempt to prevent the \"Hasmonean family for marrying into the family of Herod, a descendant of slaves.\" He also provides Nachmanides' view about prostitution and attempts to explain why Onkelos may have rendered the verse differently. </p>\n\n<p>Bleich seems to state that the mention of slaves is a metaphor (or more realistically, an example) for any couple which is \"halakhically incapable... of a valid marriage.\" Bleich quotes Maimonides but explains the meaning of Onkelos to say that fornication can still acquire a legitimate marriage. He posits that Onkelos is implying that an invalid marriage is between a non-Jew and a Jew or a slave and a free person since the two cannot make contact in this way, he renders the verse as an example. </p>\n\n<p>Bleich seems to draw derash from Onkelos as Nachmanides have done (ibn Ezra thinks Onkelos does not contain derash and that derash was interpolated or inserted into it. Drazin writes at length on this issue). Drazin posits, like ibn Ezra, that Onkelos does not contain derash and should be read according to its plain meaning. It follows, that Nachmanides was the first to record derash into Onkelos. Yet Onkelos itself does not translate the Bible according to its plain meaning. Onkelos does this on certain occasions as in order to show respect to G-d (an explanation for this is very tedious as it goes well beyond the scope of this answer. It requires another question if you want to know more about this topic). </p>\n\n<p>In short, there is no correct answer per se. Both rabbis offer several explanations and Onkelos could very well be speaking for many audiences. If we accept the idea that derash can and should be read into Onkelos, we might accept Bleich's interpretation more openly as \"one\" explanation for reading the verse. But if we go with the majority who says that Onkelos does not contian derash then this could be a good example of why Bleich's explanation is not shared amongst many Jews. Note that this does would imply that Bleich is inherently wrong, it could still be a valid interpretation. Hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

You wrote: “the side of the page is usually for notes about reading/pronunciation...”. I believe that is exactly what the side note is saying. When reading Chumash for study purposes, as opposed to reading for the tzibbur or doing shnayim mikra, the custom is to not pronounce G-d’s name. We therefore would pronounce the word elohei as elokei. However, if the word is not referring to G-d, but rather to a secular deity, one is allowed to say elohei even during general study. Thus, the note is informing you that here elohei is chol so it could be read/pronounced as written. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Yeshu’s teaching on divorce qualify the Notzri as a false prophet according to the Halakhah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m an Italian Noahide.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to the false prophet, this is what Rambam says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mishneh Torah-Yesodei haTorah 9:1</p>\n  \n  <p>It is clear and explicit in the Torah that it is [God's] commandment,\n  remaining forever without change, addition, or diminishment, as\n  [Deuteronomy 13:1] states: \"All these matters which I command to you,\n  you shall be careful to perform. You may not add to it or diminish\n  from it,\" and [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: \"What is revealed is for us\n  and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah.\"\n  This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's\n  directives forever. It is also said: \"It is an everlasting statute for\n  all your generations,\" and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: \"It is not in\n  the heavens.\" This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new\n  precept [to the Torah]. Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew\n  or gentile, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to:</p>\n  \n  <p>a) add a mitzvah, b) withdraw a mitzvah c) explain a mitzvah in a\n  manner which differs from the tradition received from Moses, or d) if\n  he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but\n  rather were given for a limited time,</p>\n  \n  <p>He is a false prophet. He comes to deny the prophecy of Moses and\n  should be executed by strangulation, because he dared to make\n  statements in God's name which God never made. God, blessed be His\n  name, commanded Moses that this commandment is for us and our children\n  forever, and, God is not man that He speak falsely</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rambam himself, not even the King Messiah appears authorized by HaShem, except my mistake, to modify the Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mishneh Torah-Melachim uMilchamot 11:3</p>\n  \n  <p>One should not presume that the Messianic king must work miracles and\n  wonders, bring about new phenomena in the world, resurrect the dead,\n  or perform other similar deeds. This is definitely not true. (…) The\n  main thrust of the matter is: This Torah, its statutes and its laws,\n  are everlasting. We may not add to them or detract from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As is known to those who know Christian sacred texts, Yeshu would have argued that the divorce was a \"concession\" given by HaShem to the Israelites for the \"hardness of their hearts”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gospel According to Matthew 19:1-8</p>\n  \n  <p>And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed\n  from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan; \n  and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.  And\n  there came unto him Pharisees, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful\n  for a man to put away his wife for every cause?  And he answered and\n  said, Have ye not read, that he who made them from the beginning made\n  them male and female, and said,For this cause shall a man leave his\n  father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall\n  become one flesh?  So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What\n  therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. They say\n  unto him,]Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement,\n  and to put her away?  He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of\n  heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it\n  hath not been so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Up to this point, in my opinion, there are no real problems of contrast between the affirmations of Yeshu and the Torah; in fact, beyond the somewhat questionable arguments of ha Notzri, it does not seem to me against the Law to invite anyone not to exercise a right recognized by the Law itself; the only hypothesis of contrast could perhaps be recognized, in my opinion of course, in the presence of full-blown adultery of the wife not punishable by the death penalty, a case in which, if I am not mistaken, the Oral Torah obliges the husband to repudiate his wife.</p>\n\n<p>The problems arise for the second part of the teaching, where Yeshu would have pronounced extremely harsh sanctions against those who would instead use the right to divorce, as shown below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Matthew 5:32</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Anyone who divorces his wife, except in the case of fornication,\n  exposes her to adultery,and whoever marries a divorced woman (except\n  in the case of fornication) commits adultery.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>Matthew 19:9</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Anyone who divorces his wife, except in the case of fornication, and\n  marries another commits adultery.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Gospel According to Mark 10:11</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery\n  against her.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Gospel according to Luke 16:18</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; who\n  marries a woman repudiated by her husband, commits adultery \".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The statements in Matthew 5:32 could perhaps, and I stress perhaps, be read as Yeshu's adherence to the teaching of Rabbi Shammai, which limited the lawfulness of divorce to cases of sexual impudence of the wife. However, all the other prescriptions of Yeshu reported above seem to me to objectively contest the precepts of the Torah, since they qualify with the very serious crime of adultery some perfectly legitimate conduct according to the Torah, which are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Marry a divorced woman;</p></li>\n<li><p>Divorce one's wife and marry another. This second \"sanction\" attributed to Yeshu also leads to an even more radical protest against the Torah, as in addition to contrasting with the institution of divorce it also distorts the case of adultery itself, which is the sexual intercourse between a man, no matter if married unless, and the wife of another, or with his arusah.Excepted my mistake, if a married Jewish man betrays his wife with an unmarried woman, he does not commit adultery, but possibly  the less serious crime of prostitution ex Deuteronomy 23: 18</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I therefore wonder: but on the halachic plane, do these teachings of Yeshu qualify him as a false prophet? It seems so to me.</p>\n\n\n",

Intelligence is also what separates man from animal. God gave us the capability to be intelligent while, other animals lack such skill. God wants us to develop intelligence and guide others.</p>\n\n<p>Think about in this these terms why would God allow humans to exist if we're going to just cause evil and good in this world. The Judge is merely an intelligent person who is capable of helping people and understanding what proper course of action should be taken in order for an individual who has caused evil to reform or change.</p>\n\n<p>God is often seen as the final judge because he is King of the Universe meaning he is the most intelligent being in existance. And if God was to hand out judgements to everyone in this life then, we wouldn't have the potential of human achievement of people going out on their own and following the ways of God if he we were to blindly obey God's every command.</p>\n\n<p>the reason being why intelligence is so valued is that without intelligence how does one become like Moses and serve God? Can someone without an education really be serving God? There are no doubt some people who are very intelligent well mannered and are poor and serving God while, there are wealth people who don't serve God as they lack the intelligence to do proper actions via the Knowledge of the Torah. And Vice versa there are poor people who lack intelligence and rich people who have intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there can't be any form of society without intelligence. Our Laws are written with words that must be read. Our actions are followed by our thoughts which must be made proper with knowledge. Any society, country, nation-state, kingdom that is formed without intelligent people will be without morals, God, and goodness. So intelligence is a necessary quality that any individual needs to serve God including Moses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -15)\n\n<p>G-d wants us to have judicial systems because G-d is not involved in the world. That is to say, G-d formed the world out of preexisting matter and has not interfered since. People need to look after themselves and not rely on G-d to perform miracles.[1] </p>\n\n<p>The second part of your question asks bout G-d punishing people in the afterlife. Additionally, and this will bother many people, Maimonides seems to say that reward and punishment does not exist. When a person dies their intellect joins (or, is absorbed to) the great intellect – that when a person s/he does not go to paradise – nor is the person judged.[2]</p>\n\n<p>[1] Idea found in Maimonides and the Book That Changed Judaism: Secrets of \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" by Rabbi Micah Goodman, chapter 1, The G-d of Maimonides, pg 3</p>\n\n<p>[2] See essay Chelek</p>\n\n\n",

Per the Iggeret of Rav Shrira Gaon (written 987CE):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ולא מצאנו אדם שנקרא \"רבן\" חוץ מן הנשיאים רבן גמליאל, רבן שמעון, <strong>רבן יוחנן בן זכאי</strong>, רבנו הקדוש.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My Translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and we haven't found anyone who gets the honorific \"rabban\" outside of people who were Nasi: Rabban Gamliel, Rabban Shimon, <strong>Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai</strong>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> On the question if Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai was a priest, there some conflicting evidence.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rashi on Shabbat 31a:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תורמסי תרומה - הצריכות לשמרן בטהרה וגם הוא <strong>היה כהן</strong> כדאמרינן [בתוספתא דפרה] (פ\"ג) אם מה שעשו ידי שכחת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My Translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he [Rabban Yochanan] <strong>was also a priest</strong> as we see (in Tosefta) \"what my hands did\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tosefta in question (מה שעשו ידי - \"what my hands did\") refers to a statement Rabban Yochanan makes where he claims that his hands forgot how to do certain duties that only priests were allowed to preform.   Rashi reads from this that Rabban Yochanan was indeed a priest.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> On the other hand, Tosefot have the opinion that Rabban Yochanan was not a priest </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהכהנים דורשין מקרא זה לעצמן. <strong>משמע דרבן יוחנן בן זכאי לא היה כהן</strong> והא דתניא בסיפרי גבי פרה שאמר רבן יוחנן בן זכאי לתלמידיו מה שעשו ושרתו ידי שכחתי לאו דהוא עצמו קאמר אלא כלומר ע\"פ הוראתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The priests justify this text to their own benefit.   <strong>This means that Rabban Yochanan be Zakai was not a priest</strong>.  And as to what it says [in Sifrei about Parah] that Rabban Yochanan said to his students \"what my hands did\" is not that he did it himself, but it was according to his ruling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, Tosefot claims that since Rabban Yochanan rejects the priestly interpretation, this means he was not a priest.   They further resolve the Tosefta (\"my hands forgot\") by saying that statement refers to a ruling Rabban Yochanan made about the priestly duties, not that he did them himself.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Related to your question, the Ramban on Niddah (49b) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והא דקתני בסנהדרין ואין הכל כשרין לדון דיני נפשות אלא כהנים לוים\n  וישראלים המשיאין לכהונה הא פריש רב יהודה דלמעוטי ממזר וגר אתי אבל חלל\n  אינו בכלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation would be roughly as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Jews whose daughters are allowed to marry Priests\", is to exclude people born out of forbidden relationships and converts, but a Chalal [a Jew born out of forbidden relationship between a priest and a divorced women] is not excluded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the above criteria allows pretty much any Jew \"in good standing\" to join the Sanhedrin.   Thus regardless of Rabban Yochanan's origin, this in itself was not a legal reason to exclude him from serving as head of the Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To answer the second question (Nic answered the first question in depth so see his great answer) Raban Yochanan Ben Zakai was the Nasi - head of the Sanhedrin according to Tosfos Avoda Zara 13a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבן יוחנן בן זכאי שהיה נשיא קודם ר\"ג משכה נשיאותו עד לאחר חורבן כדתנן (ר\"ה דף כט:) משחרב בית המקדש התקין רבן יוחנן בן זכאי</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabban Yochanan Ben Zakai was the Nasi at the time of destruction of the (second) Temple till after the destruction as Implied in Mishna Rosh Hashana \"When the Temple was destroyed Rabban Yochanan Instituted.. (i.e as Nasi it was in his power to institute)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where to light chanukah candles in an apartment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 671:5 rules that one places one's chanukah lights by the door that leads to the <em>reshut harabim</em>, and that if one has a courtyard between his house and the <em>reshut harabim</em>, then one lights at the entrance to the courtyard. If one lives on an upper floor without direct access to the <em>reshut harabim</em>, one places it in the window where it can be seen from the <em>reshut harabim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>How does all this apply to one living in a modern apartment building? Is the entrance from the hallway to his apartment considered \"a door that leads to the <em>reshut harabim</em>\"? Or is the hallway considered a courtyard, so that the entrance to the building is the entrance to the courtyard?</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe neither of these options work, in which case maybe he is considered like one who lives in an attic and should be lighting by the window? (Note that if that is indeed the solution, then modern tall apartment buildings may run in to the maximum height limit of twenty <em>amot</em> discussed in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29217/chanukiyah-height-restriction-and-modern-architecture\">this question</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If your apartment is above 20 amot from the ground level outside the building, then you should light your menorah at your apartments entry doorway leading to the hall. </p>\n\n<p>See the following paragraph entitled, \"Placing the Menorah 20 Amos from the ground:\" from <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/position-of-menorah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ShulchanAruchHaRav.com</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Placing the Menorah 20 Amos from the ground</em>: The Menorah may not be placed higher than twenty Amos [9.6 meters or 31.5 feet] from the ground. If it was placed higher than twenty Amos from the ground, one does not fulfilled his obligation. This applies whether one is lighting outside the front door of the house, or inside his house. If one lit the candles above 20 Amos, and then placed it in the proper area, it is invalid. [When lighting outside the front door of one’s home which faces towards the outside, or by a window that faces the public, the above height is measured from the ground floor of the outside, and not from the floor of the home. However, one who is lighting inside his house and not by a window that faces the public, measures the 20 Amos from the floor of his house and not from the street level. Thus, one who lives in a very tall building, may light candles in his upper floor apartment, even though it is twenty Amos above street level.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Please take note at the end of the footnotes to the linked page, the <em>opinon of some</em> mentioned in connection with the idea of publicizing the miracle, lighting at your window in an apartment above 20 amot and if your building is surrounded by other apartment buildings also at the hight of your  apartment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

In the Artscroll, there is the word \"chol\" in the margins for 2 of them, which echoes Rashi's commentary. The marking of \"Chol\" apparently has to do with the inherent holiness of the name which might impact a sofer, or the rules regarding erasing the text (as per the Siftei Chachamim on the rashi on the pasuk). However there is some confusion regarding the status of the the third use, the \"elohei\" which precedes \"avihem.\"</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 statements about the pasuk (one in Bereishit Rabbah and one in Masechet Soferim) and Rashi according to sites like Sefaria (and, by the omission of any other attribution, my 2 sets of Mikra'ot Gedolot) quotes Bereishit Rabbah for all three instances but for the third cites the statement as made in Soferim.</p>\n\n<p>He quotes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.53?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en&p3=Bereishit_Rabbah.74.16&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabbah</a> which states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֱלֹהֵי אַבְרָהָם, קֹדֶשׁ, וֵאלֹהֵי נָחוֹר, חֹל, אֱלֹהֵי אֲבִיהֶם, מַשְׁמָעוֹ קֹדֶשׁ וְחֹל (בראשית לא, נג).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but Rashi <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8226/showrashi/true#v53\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלהי אביהם: חול:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which seems to reflect the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Soferim.4.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soferim</a> Quote</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלהי אברהם (בראשית ל״א:נ״ג) קודש ואלהי נחור (שם) חול אלהי אביהם (שם) חול</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.53?lang=bi&with=Minchat%20Shai&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchat Shai</a> deals in some way with the difference between the two understandings (and I'm not saying I fully understand what he is getting at) but I'm curious more why Rashi would cite one but quote the other.</p>\n\n<p>This is all obviated by later publishers and publishings which assign the third instance to Masechet Soferim (I have yet to find a published Chumash which attributes all three to M\"Soferim), but that raises a question as to why Rashi would use one source for the first two and a different source for the third.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, this is all moot if the attribution is just a collection of later (and sloppy or arbitrary) guesswork, but I'm hopeful that there is some deeper reason or logic at work here. </p>\n\n\n",

Wörterb.\" ii. 206), the word \"ḥanak\" (to initiate) is derived from the \"rubbing of the throat\" of an infant for the purpose of cleansing it and enabling it to take the mother's milk, and is therefore applied to every form of initiation. It appears, moreover, that the \"rubbing\" remained for a long time an essential feature of the rite of initiation, for \"every consecration in Biblical times was accompanied by rubbing or anointing with oil the object to be consecrated. Thus the pillar at Bethel was anointed (Gen. xxviii. 18; compare the \"dedication\" of Nebuchadnezzar's image, Dan. iii. 2 et seq.). The priests and the vessels of the Tabernacle were anointed with oil (Ex. xxviii. 41, xxx. 26; Lev. viii. 10-12; Num. vii. 13), and by this rite they were \"hallowed.\" \"Mishḥat Adonai\" is, therefore, \"consecration to the Lord\" (Lev. x. 7)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I find this a promising line of inquiry into the otherwise mysterious practice of anointing but, perhaps because I'm not a mother, nothing I can relate to or picture. Can someone please explain the practice in terms I might understand?</p>\n\n<p>One thing I would like clarified is whether this rubbing of the baby's throat was done by the mother each time she breastfed or whether it was done by a priest to bless the child's ability to feed throughout life.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm guessing that his mother warned him about her brother. But there is nothing in the text or any Midrash or other commentary that I could find explaining how he knew.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Midrash Lekach Tov (collected by Rav Toviah Ben Eliezer 11th century) Bereishis 28,15 says that G-d informed Yaakov he would protect him against Lavan in the prophetic vision (with the Ladder and Angels before having gone to Lavan) thus implying Lavan could harm Yaakov. Being the wise man Yakov was, he proceeded with caution (Hishtadlus) to protect himself from Lavan as much as possible from monetory or bodily damage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה אנכי עמך. להצילך מן הרוחות ומן המזיקין.<br>\n  **ושמרתיך בכל אשר תלך. בבית לבן. דכתיב השמר לך מדבר עם יעקב מטוב ועד רע (בראשית לא כט).</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Behold I will be with you\" - to save you from evil spirits and damages,<br>\n  \"I will guard you where-ever you may go\" - in the house of Lavan as it is  written regarding Lavan: \"Dare not speak to Yaakov either good or bad.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Based on Rashi's own words, and based on Rashi's sources, he did not know for certain that Lavan was a deceiver, but knew this as a cultural aspect of the people in Lavan's place, which is, then, perhaps something well known.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8224/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-29.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's own words</a>, we might see some uncertainty as to Lavan's status as deceiver or righteous person. On verse 12, Rashi writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אחי אביה הוא: קרוב לאביה, כמו (לעיל יג ח) אנשים אחים אנחנו. ומדרשו אם לרמאות הוא בא גם אני אחיו ברמאות, ואם אדם כשר הוא, גם אני בן רבקה אחותו הכשרה:</p>\n  \n  <p>that he was her father’s kinsman: Heb. אִחִי אָבִיהָ, lit., her father’s brother. Related to her father, as (above 13:8):“we are kinsmen (אַחִים)” (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer , ch. 36). Its midrashic interpretation is: If he (Laban) comes to deceive me, I, too, am his brother in deception, and if he is an honest man, I, too, am the son of his honest sister Rebecca. [from Gen. Rabbah 70:13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Throughout, Rashi channels Bereishit Rabba. The midrash referred to in the question, in <a href=\"http://daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=29&mefaresh=raba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Rabba, reads as follows</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאהב יעקב את רחל\n  בגין דאנא ידע דאנשי מקומך רמאין, לפיכך אני מברר עסקי עמך.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"And Yaakov loved Rachel... [and he said, \"I will work for you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.]Since I know that the people of you place are tricksters, therefore I will make my matters clear with you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, in the original midrash, Yaakov explicitly tells Lavan that he knows that the people in his location are liars.</p>\n\n<p>This information need not have come from his mother. If it is a cultural trait, then this could have simply been well known information to any adult living in the Ancient Near East.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would also assume that either his mother told him or it was well-known information. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the Rishonim understand that when  Yaakov had the conversation about Lavan at the well with the shepherds he was also asking them about the type of person Lavan was. (Although very few understand in the shepherd's <em>answers</em> anything negative about Lavan) </p>\n\n<p>Possibly after he rolled off the rock for them they felt indebted to him and were more forthcoming with information.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Talmud Bavli Sanhedrin 98b: an interpretation in a messianic sense of the figure of the \"suffering servant\" of Isaiah 52-53?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m an Italian  noahide. \nI read in various Jewish sources, and also in this forum at</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/73754/the-suffering-servant-yeshayahu-isaiah-chapter-53/73756#73756\">The suffering servant? Yeshayahu- Isaiah - Chapter 53</a></p>\n\n<p>that the figure of the \"suffering servant\" described in Isaiah 52-53 is interpreted in the Jewish tradition as referring to the entire people of Israel and not to an individual figure. But I read the following passage in the Talmud Bavli:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.98b.14?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 98b</a></p>\n  \n  <p>Apropos the Messiah, the Gemara asks: What is his name? The school of\n  Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when\n  Shiloh shall come” (Genesis 49:10). The school of Rabbi Yannai says:\n  Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may\n  his name continue [yinnon] as long as the sun; and may men bless\n  themselves by him” (Psalms 72:17). The school of Rabbi Ḥanina says:\n  Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor\n  [ḥanina]” (Jeremiah 16:13). And some say that Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya is\n  his name, as it is stated: “Because the comforter [menaḥem] that\n  should relieve my soul is far from me” (Lamentations 1:16). <strong>And the\n  Rabbis say: The leper of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is his name,\n  as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he\n  endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and\n  afflicted” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.53.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 53:4</a>).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the passage above shows that, in addition to a collective interpretation, there is also in the Jewish tradition an individual interpretation, and specifically messianic, of the \"suffering servant\".</p>\n\n<p>I also read the Italian edition of “Sefer Vikkuah haRamban”, the famous “Barcelona Dispute”, where this great master says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It is true that our masters, their memory be blessed, in the books of\n  the Haggadah they refer to the Messiah the interpretation of this\n  passage \"(referring to the “suffering servant” in Isaiah 52:13 and\n  later;editor's note). But they never said that the Messiah would die at the hands of\n  the enemies”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I therefore wonder: why then is this messianic interpretation often not mentioned? It seems to me that it is  attested in the Jewish tradition</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>A messianic interpretation of the \"suffering servant\" passages was known in Jewish tradition, as you point out from Sanhedrin 98b. This interpretation is also found in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Targum_Jonathan_on_Isaiah.52.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Targum</a> on the verse, as well as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Toldot.14.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma, Toledot 14</a>. In other words, this has been interpreted as a passage about the Messiah for a long time. This isn't the only place that a traditional interpretation of a controversial passage was displaced (compare <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.94a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 94a</a> vs. Rashi and Radak to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.9.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 9:5</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The reason why the interpretation of the servant as Israel is mentioned more often as the \"Jewish interpretation\" is probably because of the medieval Jewish-Christian debates, and the commentaries that arose from them. The Christian side would want the Jew to concede that the passage speaks about the Messiah, then to concede that the Messiah spoken of is Jesus. It's easier for the Jew to deny that the passage mentions the Messiah at all, so as to concede as little as possible in the dispute. This is a tactic in medieval dialectic theory of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/obligationes/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">obligations</a>, and the Ramban seems to have taken advantage of this in his dispute when he said that he didn't believe in aggadot (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22088&st=&pgnum=31&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22088&st=&pgnum=33&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The passage in Sanhedrin 98b,can't be taken as one of the claimed proofs that in the Jewish tradition ,exits an individual <em>messianic</em> interpretation,of Isaiah 53.</p>\n<p><strong>from Wikipedia \"Isaiah 53\":</strong></p>\n<p>\"Sanhedrin 98b in the Babylonian Talmud speculates rather ironically about the undisclosed name of the unrevealed Jewish Messiah to come, so as to say it could be anyone: leper of the school (a hint on rabbinical disciples cast out of their seminary/school) based on Isaiah 53:4, Rabbi Nachman based on Jeremiah 30:21, Shiloh based on Genesis 49:10, Yinon based on Psalm 72:17, Rabbi Hanina reckons it is him, based on Jeremiah 16:13, Menachem ben Hizkija based on Lamentations 1:16\"</p>\n<p>quote from steinsaltz.org</p>\n<p><strong>Sanhedrin 98a-b: Candidates for Messiah</strong>\n\"The Gemara on today’s daf continues its discussion of mashi’aḥ – the Messiah. One of the questions that is dealt with is “What is his name?” Several possibilities are suggested in the Gemara –</p>\n<p>In Rabbi Sheila’s study hall the suggestion was “Shiloh” (see Bereshit 49:10)</p>\n<p>In Rabbi Yannai’s study hall the suggestion was “Yinnon” (see Tehillim 72:17)</p>\n<p>In Rabbi Ḥanina’s study hall the suggestion was “Ḥanina” (see Yirmiyahu 16:13)</p>\n<p>Another suggestion raised was that he is “Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya” (see Eikha 1:16).</p>\n<p>Clearly all of these Sages were suggesting the names of their teachers as potential candidates to be the Messiah – something that we find regarding the names of other Sages in different midrashim, as well. This is, apparently, based on the continuation of the Gemara where it is taught that <strong>in every generation there are individuals who are worthy of being the Messiah</strong>, but because the time has not yet come he cannot be crowned as such. The students sitting in the various study halls each saw their own Rabbi as being the one most likely to play that role in that generation.</p>\n<p>The Gra suggests that the names listed in the Gemara form an acrostic –</p>\n<p>Menaḥem</p>\n<p>Shiloh</p>\n<p>Yinnon</p>\n<p>Ḥanina</p>\n<p>whose opening letters spell out “Mashi’aḥ.”</p>\n<p>Rav Naḥman is quoted as saying that if the Messiah was someone who was living in his generation, then he – Rav Naḥman himself – would be the obvious candidate. The passage that he refers to in order to support his claim appears in Sefer Yirmiyahu (30:21) where we learn that it is someone already in a leadership position who will be the mashi’aḥ, and Rav Naḥman filled that role.</p>\n<p>Even in later generations it was not uncommon to find Jewish leaders who hinted in their writings to the possibility that they were worthy of bringing the redemption, something that was, on occasion, taken very seriously by their students. \"</p>\n<p><strong>TO ADD</strong></p>\n<p>The \"leper scholar\" was a real Jew and he is mentioned a few times in Talmud.   Marguliout HaYom a commentary on the Talmud by Rabbi Reuven Margolious (an Israeli Talmudic scholar and head of the Rambam Library at Tel Aviv University) wrote:  “Look at the Jerusalem Talmud Tractate Chagigah chapter 2 Halacha 1. There we see that Rabbi had a special wise student who taught on the ‘Work of the Chariot’, without the approval of Rabbi, and for that he was stricken with leprosy. This talmid who was stricken was called ‘the leper of the house of Rabbi.’ And they said about him, ‘Surely our diseases he did bear’”</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>The QUOTES of the schools mentioned, were being driven by the names of their beloved rabbis, and presented names for the messiah based on plays on the names of their own teachers ....</p>\n<p>while it is true that they extracted some of the names from verses that previously were interpreted as messianic ,but that doesn't necessarily require, that it was the case with all the names .</p>\n<p>for example the case of Jer 16:13 ,nowhere in the Jewish literature that it has been interpreted messianicaly at all.</p>\n<p>and the only instance outside the Talmud to Isaiah 53 ,that has a messianic reference ,is found in The Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel\nWhat is abundantly clear is that the targum very clearly portrays the messiah as a conquering warrior, not as a suffering servant. The targum’s interpretation of Isaiah radically alters Isaiah’s meaning. In the targum, it is not the messiah who suffers; the messiah conquers. Rather, it is the messiah’s enemies, and the nation of Israel, who suffer.</p>\n<p>to conclude the point : when the rabbis said : \"The leper of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted” (Isaiah 53:4).\"</p>\n<p>they were reading the life of this beloved master (whom they thought to deserve to be the messiah of his generation) into a passage of Isaiah 53 ,out of its context ..\nto say :\"our beloved Yehuda HaNasi the messiah of this generation, though some may think that he was stricken by God, and afflicted \"being a leper\",yet the contrary is true ...</p>\n<p>It is in some way similar to the case of early Christians, who read the crucifixion into a passage (Isaiah 53) that has never been read as \"a suffering, dying messiah ben David) before Christianity.</p>\n<p>the new testament affirms repeatedly that the idea of a suffering ,dying messiah ben David, was a new one (shocking even to the followers of Jesus),let alone the rest of the Jews (a stumbling block for the Jews) see (1 Corinthians 1:23) etc....</p>\n\n\n",

This root has several different meanings which can be found in the Jastrow dictionary, such as:</p>\n\n<p>1) to kiss (<em>with the mouth</em>)</p>\n\n<p>2) to equip, meaning to supply or furnish or provide for</p>\n\n<p>3) to cleanse or make ritually fit</p>\n\n<p>This last meaning also has a connotation of <em>immersing in water</em> like in the case of a mikvah and also <em>watering</em> from השקה and להשקות. </p>\n\n<p>And it is in context of these additional meanings that the commentary Tz'ror HaMor by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Saba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Avraham Saba</a> to this parsha deals with the inner understanding of the text.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Saba explains in connection with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tzror_HaMor_on_Torah%2C_Genesis.29.1.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 29:1-2</a> that through prophetic vision, Yaacov was aware of the extreme impurity of the place he was traveling to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחר כך אמר וישא יעקב רגליו וילך ארצה בני קדם. הרצון בזה לפי שיעקב קודם המראה היה ירא מעשו ומלבן. לפי ששמע שהיה לבן רמאי גדול ומכשף גדול ולבן <strong>היה מושבו בארץ קדם שהיא ארץ טמאה מלאה גלולים וכישופים.</strong> ולכן אמרו רז\"ל ולבני הפלגשים אשר לאברהם נתן אברהם מתנות. שמות הטומאה מסר להם וישלחם קדמה אל ארץ קדם מקום ראוי להם. כי שם נמצאו כל הכישופים. <strong>כאומרו כי מלאו מקדם ומעוננים כפלשתים. ולכן היה יעקב מתירא מהם ולא היה רוצה ללכת שם.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Saba goes on to explain that in this context, one understanding of this parsha is addressing the final redemption through Moshiach and how that takes place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ורז\"ל גילו בכאן</strong> מסתורים גדולים שהם כבשונו של עולם <strong>בענין קץ משיחנו ועיכוב הגאולה. בסבת אבן הזאת הגדולה שהיא לב אבן.</strong> הנם כתובים בספרי הזוהר ואינם בידי כי נגזל ממני בעונותי בגירוש פורטוגא\"ל. <strong>ונראה שזאת הפרשה קשורה עם של מעלה. ובכאן התחיל יעקב להשלים נפשו בשלימות האמתי.</strong> והתחיל השם יתברך להשגיח עליו ולהשלים דברו. שנאמר והיה ה' לי לאלהים. שיהא נקרא אלהי יעקב כמו האבות. בענין שגם כן האבות יהיו המרכבה. ולכן אמר וירא והנה באר בשדה. <strong>וזה הבאר היא אבן הראשה. האבן אשר שם מראשותיו משם רועה אבן ישראל.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And he then explains that the great stone covering the well is the obstacles which were to be the cause for the future destruction of the first two Temples and that it also blocks the final redemption.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולהורות על שלימות יעקב. <strong>הראהו שם שלשה עדרי צאן רובצים עליה. שהם גדולה גבורה תפארת. שהם כנגד אברהם יצחק יעקב.</strong> בענין שיעקב חבל נחלתו והוא משולש בזכיות והוא רגל ראשון מהמרכבה. וזה וירא והנה באר בשדה. זהו שדה אשר ברכו ה' שאמר יצחק ליעקב. והיא באר שבע. ועליה יושבים שלשה עדרי צאן הם האבות. <strong>והאבן גדולה על פי הבאר. היא אבן נגף וצור מכשול לשני בתי ישראל שנתן עיניו במקדש ראשון ובמקדש שני והחריבם.</strong> וזהו סכות בענן לך מעבור תפלה. <strong>וצריך סיוע וזכות אבות להסיר האבן מעל פי הבאר.</strong> לפי שהיא סתומה וצריך שיאספו כל העדרים של מעלה ושל מטה להסיר האבן מעל פי הבאר. <strong>וזהו סבת עיכוב גאולתינו בעונותינו.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the remedy for these obstacles to the redemption is the merit of the Avot and Imahot together with our learning the Torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ולכן צריך שנתעסק בתורה. ונשקה הצאן במי התורה. וזהו השקו הצאן.</strong> והם השיבו לא נוכל עד אשר יאספו כל העדרים של מעלה ושל מטה להעביר האבן מעל פי הבאר. ואנו מחכים לאבן הראשה אבן ישראל שיבא לפוצץ סלעים. ולהסיר האבן הגדולה מעל פי הבאר. כאומרו בדניאל חזה הוית עד די איתגזירת אבן די לא בידין ומחת לצלמא על רגלוהי. <strong>וזה יהיה בסיוע האבות והאמהות. ובפרט רחל שהיא עקרת הבית</strong> צריכה להתחנן על בניה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Rabbi Saba then goes on to explain that this fourth and final redemption comes in particular through the merit of Yaacov and Rachel working together through their prayers and the words of Torah they speak. That this is the <em>watering of the flocks</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ו<strong>זה שאמר ויהי כאשר ראה יעקב את רחל בת לבן אחי אמו. שהיא בוכה ומתאוננת על בניה. ויגש יעקב בתפלה ובתחנונים.</strong> ויגל את האבן מעל פי הבאר. <strong>לפי שלו משפט הגאולה לגאול בגלות רביעי. בענין שיבנה בית יעקב על מכונה. ולכן תמצא בגלות רביעי וזכרתי את בריתי יעקב וגו': והזכיר ליעקב בראשונה.</strong> לפי שהוא בעל הקורה. <strong>והוא לקח הוא\"ו של אליהו והוסיפה על שמו למשכון שיבא לגאול את בניו. ולכן כתב יעקוב מלא בוא\"ו. וכן רמז בכאן יעקוב מלא בוא\"ו. וכן רמז בכאן שיבא אליהו לגאול את בני יעקב באלף הששי שאנו עומדים בו. ולכן נכתב מלא וא\"ו.</strong> וכן תמצא שכמו שבכתה רחל דכתיב רחל מבכה על בניה. כן בכה יעקב. ולזה אמר וישא את קולו ויבך כדכתיב קול על שפיים נשמע בכי תחנוני בני ישראל. <strong>השם יתברך יראנו מתורתו נפלאות:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this leads to the answer to your question concerning what this <em>kiss of the mouth</em> is adding.</p>\n\n<p>There are different levels within the Torah. And the innermost <em>secrets</em> of the Torah, the <em>wonders of the Torah</em> נפלאות התורה, what are called Kabbalah, Torat HaNavuah and Chassidut today, are referred to as the <em>kisses of the mouth</em>, like is found in connection with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 1:2</a> from King Solomon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>יִשָּׁקֵ֙נִי֙ מִנְּשִׁיק֣וֹת פִּ֔יהוּ</strong> כִּֽי־טוֹבִ֥ים דֹּדֶ֖יךָ מִיָּֽיִן׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is what Rabbi Saba goes on to express, that through the great love and yearning of Yaacov Avinu, he speaks these <em>wonders</em> together with Rachel. That Yaacov kisses Rachel in order to bring the fourth and final redemption.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולי רמז <strong>ויהי כאשר ראה יעקב את רחל. כי בראותו אותה חשקה נפשו בה.</strong> <strong>וידוע כי החושקים ואוהבים אשר אומרים שיעשו גבורות ונפלאות עד אין מספר.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is in keeping with the adage that the final redemption comes through the merit of our learning the inner aspect of the Torah, the <em>Penimiyut HaTorah</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

And [concerning] the bulls that engage in work, it only gave four females to the male; and to the donkey who goes on long journeys, [it gave] two females to the male, and to the camels that go on [even] longer journeys, [it gave] one female to the male.

Also, I don't know of any empirical support that working animals (bulls) have lesser mating patterns than non-working (rams).</p>\n\n<p>What is Rashi's logic here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The way this question framed, it is basically that Rashi says X, I think not X, so what is Rashi's logic. It may simply be that Rashi doesn't agree with your premise. (I am writing this not to be rude but because it seems like a common trend in the questions you pose, and this, by itself, might be the overarching answer.)</p>\n<p>To the specifics. Firstly, Rashi begins by explicitly crediting <a href=\"http://daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=32&mefaresh=raba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabba</a> for the basic idea, although Rashi does expand upon it. Rashi fleshes out details and mentions animal work, parallel to human work. Bereishit Rabba states the following, and credits Rabbi Elazar with the idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וילן שם בלילה ההוא ויקח מן הבא בידו מנחה לעשו אחיו עזים מאתים ותישים עשרים\nאמר רבי אלעזר:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכאן לעונה האמורה בתורה, הטיילים בכל יום, הפועלים שתים בשבת, הספנין אחת לששה חדשים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עזים מאתים\nשהן צריכות תיישים עשרים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רחלים מאתים\nשהן צריכות אילים עשרים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גמלים מיניקות\nובניהם שלושים ובנאיהם שלושים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea is that the onah, required marital relations, differing for different human tradesmen, is here derived, or alluded to, in the Torah, from Yaakov's actions. How so, because we see that in Yaakov's gifts, he gave a different amount of males per female, because, from a practical - rather than halachic - perspective, this is the amount a breeder would match up, because of differing practical needs of the species.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that there is a <em>halachic</em> requirement of onah by animals, as you are assuming. And I don't think Rashi or Rabbi Eleazar said otherwise.</p>\n<p>You wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>IMHO, if only one mating is needed to impregnate a female, one male is sufficient for any number of females, given enough time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yaakov was an extremely successful breeder, as we saw in the previous sidra regarding Lavan's sheep. Being a successful businessman, and multiplying your wealth, requires that you breed your animals in the most efficient manner possible, not to take one male animal to impregnate your sheep over several decades. In Vayeitzei, he worked with the striped rods not because of a sense of halachic obligation of onah for the poor female sheep, but to build wealth. So too here, the appropriate gift to Esav would be a sustainable one in which wealth could be built. That is pshat in Midrash Rabba and in Rashi, not what you are presuming and then asking about.</p>\n<p>You further ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, I don't know of any empirical support that working animals (bulls) have lesser mating patterns than non-working (rams).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't know either, but this was presumably either the direct observation of Rabbi Eleazar or the assumption made based on a plain reading of the pesukim. Chazal often derive facts about nature from pesukim rather than citing scientific studies. They even have proofs from pesukim that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and of the direction from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel.</p>\n<p>That you haven't seen empirical evidence to support this idea - well, firstly, have you seen empirical evidence that <strong>contradicts</strong> this idea? Without that empirical evidence, it isn't much of a question on Rashi. And even if such contrary empirical evidence exists, why would you assume that Rashi would be aware of said evidence, such that he would need to explain his logic? Perhaps he relied on the science stated by Chazal in Midrash Rabba, which he is surely entitled to do!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Note that the Rashi is separated by the pesukim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8227/showrashi/true#v16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayishlach 32:16</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thirty nursing camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls,\n  twenty she donkeys and ten he donkeys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thirty nursing camels with their young: Heb. וּבְנֵיהֶם. And their\n  young with them. According to the Midrash Aggadah, the word וּבְנֵיהֶם\n  means בַּנָאֵיהֶם, their builders [those who impregnate them], a male\n  corresponding to a female, but since it (the camel) is discreet in\n  mating, Scripture did not publicize it (Gen. Rabbah 76:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to other meforshim <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/32.15#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayishlach 31:16</a> this was the normal way of setting up a flock of the various animals so that the herds and flocks would be correctly handled. While one bull over a long period of time might be enough, this differentiation would allow Eisav to properly handle the animals.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra explains that this showed that Yaakov was an expert herdsman on all of these animals. That is, he showed that he was sending a flock or herd of each animal with the appropriate mix of males and females.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עזים מאתים** – בצאן שם הנקבות עשר לזכר, ולפרים ארבע, ולעירים שנים, כי**\n  ידע תולדותם, [שהיה רועה.]א</p>\n  \n  <p>Two Hundred - With sheep there were 10 female for each male, for cows\n  four, for donkeys two, because he knew how to breed them [that he was\n  an expert herdsman].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The R'Y Bchor Shor says that the language used for camels does not differentiate between male and female. Thus, it says <em>nursing camels</em> to show the females and  the young were the males.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גמלים מניקות – אין דרך העברי לתת חילוק בגמלים בין זכרים בין נקיבות\n  ולומר גמלות ולא גמלה כמו בשאר בהמות,א כמו שאמר: ״עזים״ נקיבות,\n  ״תיישים״ זכרים, וכן כולם. אבל בגמלים, אין העברי חולק. וכן בין הקטנים\n  לגדולים, אלא שהקטן קורא בן גמל בתלמוד (בבלי  חולין נ״ט.): וכנגדו ניכר\n  בבן גמל. ולכך, גמלים מניקות – כלומר: נקיבות וראויות להניק.</p>\n  \n  <p>ובניהם – כלומר: בחורים זכרים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have read other meforshim (this is from memory of some modern divrei Torah) that this actually refers to the fact that it was very difficult to breed camels in that part of the world. Thus, Yaakov sent nursing camels to show that he was such an expert that he could breed camels himself. This is similar to his sending the appropriate number of animals in each herd so that Eisav would be able to breed them properly.</p>\n\n\n",

Expecting to encounter Esau the following day, he reportedly wrestled with a man until daybreak. During the battle, Jacob’s thigh is injured. </p>\n\n<p>Maimonides felt that G-d does not rely on helpers or angels to do His will. Instead, he equates angels with the natural forces that do G-d’s will such as the wind, snow, and rain. In his Guide of the Perplexed 3: 42, Rambam writes that the events in Genesis 32:23-33 did not happen; “it was entirely a prophetic vision.” </p>\n\n<p>Some see the story as a dream. After returning from twenty years of exile Jacob may have felt uneasy and feared for his life. His fears accompanied him in his sleep. An MA in psychology also explains why Jacob limped upon awakening. It is possible that the dream impacted him due to its traumatic nature.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If we take the story literaly, however, it could be that the term angel refers to good people. The man might have wanted to test Jacob's strength if he was working for Esau or he may have wanted to tire Jacob. They might have agreed to refrain from using swords since the man did not want to kill him, as can be seen when he hurt Jacob's thigh.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your second question, G-d tested Jacob with a mission.

With Abraham, circumcision was also <strong>commanded</strong> and he prayed Shacharis (the Morning Prayer). Isaac separated out a tithe and added another prayer in the afternoon and, with Jacob, the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve was added, as was the Maariv (Evening) Prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can see that some (circumcision) are explicit commandments, while others (Teffilot) are just customs, they are not counted in the list of the 613 Mitzvos. He does count it as a Biblical prohibition (לא תעשה קפ״ג).</p>\n<p>How did Gid-Haneshe become a Mitzvah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See Chulin 101b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi JUDAH ARGUED, WAS NOT THE SCIATIC NERVE FORBIDDEN FROM THE TIME OF THE SONS OF JACOB?  etc. It was taught: [The Rabbis] said to Rabbi Judah: Does it say [in the Torah], 'Therefore the children of Jacob eat not'? Surely it says: Therefore the children of Israel eat not. Now they were first styled the children of Israel only at [the giving of the law at] Sinai; therefore [we must say that] the law [of the sciatic nerve] was given at Sinai, but was written in its present place to indicate the reason why it was prohibited. Raba raised an objection against this. It is written: And the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father!(Genesis 46.5) - That was after the incident. Rav Aha the son of Raba said to Rav Ashi: Then it should be prohibited from that time onwards, should it not? (1) - He replied: <strong>Was the Torah given at various times? And that time was neither the time of the incident nor the time of the giving of the Law</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For Rabanan two times are possible for giving the mitsva, the time of the event and the time of Matan Tora. The second one is the right because at this time the name\"Bene Israel\" was used. </p>\n\n<p>For Rabbi Yehuda, maybe that it's different,at the first glance, but the Rambam writes on the Mishna</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...ושים לבך על העיקר הגדול הנכלל במשנה הזאת והוא מה שאמר מסיני נאסר לפי שאתה הראית לדעת שכל מה שאנו מרחיקים או עושים היום אין אנו עושין אלא במצות הקב\"ה ע\"י משה רבינו ע\"ה לא שהקב\"ה אמר זה לנביאים שלפניו כגון זה שאין אנו אוכלין אבמ\"ה אינו מפני שהקב\"ה אסרו [אותו] לנח אלא לפי שמשה אסר עלינו אבמ\"ה במה שצוה בסיני שיתקיים איסור אבמ\"ה וכמו כן אין אנו מלין מפני שאברהם אבינו ע\"ה מל עצמו ואנשי ביתו אלא מפני שהקב\"ה צוה אותנו ע\"י משה רבינו שנמול כמו שמל אברהם אבינו ע\"ה וכן גיד הנשה אין אנו הולכים אחר איסור יעקב אבינו אלא מצות משה רבינו ע\"ה הלא תראה מה שאמרו תרי\"ג מצות נאמרו לו למשה מסיני וכל אלו מכלל המצות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And he seems to explain that for every people, including Rabbi Yehuda, all Mitsvot were given at Matan Tora, even those that were written in Bereshit.   But the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20144&st=&pgnum=106&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chatam Sofer in Chiddushim</a> on the Daf says that the words of the Rambam don't apply for Rabbi Yehuda. For Rabanan all Mitsvot were given in Sinai, including the 3 mitsvot written in Sefer Bereshit, but for Rabbi Yehuda the mitsva of Gid Hanashe was already given to Yaacov. But even for Rabanan, Rambam wrote in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=94121&rid=14990\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 9.1</a> that Yaacov Avinu added Mitsvat Gid Hanashe. So, there is an apparent contradiction in the line of Rabanan, according to the understanding of Rambam. The Lechem Mishne asks this and concludes  \"יעקב הנהיג עצמו וביתו לאסור גיד הנשה\" but says that he doesn't know from where the Rambam learns this. So, for Rabanan at the time of Yaacov it was a minhag, or more exactly a kind of Noachid Mitsva, in Erets Israel only, but from Matan Tora it became a Mitsva Deorayita. For Rabbi Yehuda, it was already a Mitsva from Yaacov. See in the Mefarshim on the Rambam additional explanations. The Bigde Yesha seems to say that the Machloket between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabanan is if the Mitsva given on Sinai is an exact copy of the Mitsva of Yaacov or not. </p>\n\n<p>(1) Sefer Hayashar from Rabenu Tam </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והמקשה טועה שסובר שמשעה שנקראו ישראל יחול איסור גיד הנשה ובשביל כך הוא מקשה מאותו מעשה שנקראו ישראל ליתסר. ומשני וכי תורה פעמ' כו'. אותה שעה שקרא המלאך ישראל לא שעת מעשה נשיות גיד הוה שבשביל כך נאסר ולא שעת מתן תורה הוה. ‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could Yehoshua hold up the sky without the consequences in the natural order?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard one explanation of this passage in Sefer Yehoshua, that the \"stopping\" of the sun had to do with the ceasing of its light. Yehoshua arrives at Giv'on at night, and thus Yehoshua prays for the extension of the night, rather than the extension of the day, which was covered by the hail prior to his prayer. Makes sense.\nAt the same time, according to Aztec lore in Mexico, the sun failed to rise for a whole day in the \"City of the Gods\", Teotihuacan (north of Mexico City). Likewise, it failed to rise for 20 hours in the Andes, according to Inca legends.\nSince an \"endless day\" and an \"endless night\" are the same phenomenon in opposite sides of the world, this would seem to confirm the biblical account of the sun standing still at Giv'on. </p>\n\n<p>Wouldn't the calendar be affected if the sun stood on the sky for 24 hours? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>Actually, the sun did not stand still for Joshua at Gibeon. Gersonides felt that Joshua was speaking figuratively, that it was a wonder that he defeated the five nations in a single day before the sun had set. In his Guide of the Perplexed 2:35, Maimonides says that Joshua was singing a song about the sun standing still.</p>\n\n<p>The Aztec myth tells us a story when Tecuciztecatl and Nanahuatzin volunteered to become the sun and moon. When Tecuciztecatl (as the sun) refused to rise, the plumed serpent god Quetzalcoatl sacrificed the gods so that the sun may rise. This suggests (according to the Aztec myth) that people need to make sacrifices. </p>\n\n<p>I will add that the Aztec myths do talk about the sun standing still over the \"City of the gods\", Teotihuacan, as well as the Incas. However, neither Aztec nor Inca empires existed during the time of the Bible and no other nations in that time recorded such an observation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there is no evidence that the sun stood still. I have written extensively debunking the claim of Mr. Howard Hill. He does not work for NASA and the story was copied from a Christian story by Prof Totten.</p>\n\n<p>It follows that the calendar was not effected.</p>\n\n\n",

The first teaches that woman was taken from man, 'stressing that like him you may understand and advance in the intellectual and moral field just as did the matriarchs and many righteous women and prophetesses and as the literal meaning of Proverbs 31 about \"the woman of worth\" (<em>eshet hayil</em>) indicates. The second alludes to the power of childbearing and rearing children, as is indicated by the name Eve--the mother of all living. A woman deprived of the power of childbearing will be deprived of the secondary purpose and be left with the ability to do evil or good like the man who is barren. Of both the barren man and woman Isaiah (56,5) states: \"I have given them in My house and in My walls a name that is better than sons and daughters.' since the offspring of the righteous is certainly good deeds (see Rashi on Gen. 6. 9). Jacob was therefore angry with Rachel when she said, \"Give me children or else I die,\" in order to reprimand her and make her understand this all-important principle that she was not dead as far as their joint purpose in life because she was childless, just the same as it would be, in his ease, if he would have been childless.</p>\n<p>(Translation/summary from Nehama Leibowitz <em>Studies in Bereshit</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, it would seem that if a woman did not marry (unless she had children some other way) she would indeed be \"unfulfilled\" in terms of her secondary purpose, though she could still be fulfilled in terms of her primary purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

It was all Yosef's misunderstanding. He says that they were using the <em>sefer yetzira</em>, which is only for those of noble lineage. They couldn't share it with the children of Bilhah and Zilpah, as their mothers were maidservants. Yosef took this to mean they were making fun of them, but that wasn't their intention.</p>\n<p>The brothers created an animal with <em>sefer yetzira</em>, which by definition doesn't need ritual slaughter. Yosef thought they were eating a limb from a regular animal, and therefore suspected them.</p>\n<p>He also says the brothers created a women with <em>sefer yetzira</em>. They were walking around with her, and Yosef thought she was a real women. He therefore told their father they were engaged in illicit relations.</p>\n<p>I don't understand this third point. <strong>Why would the fact that she's not a real person make it any more appropriate? Why would they make a woman in the first place? How is that appropriate?</strong> You're right it may not be גילוי עריות per se, but still seems very suspicious and doesn't seem to help their reputation much.</p>\n<p>The original text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואפשר שבראו השבטים בצירוף אותיות מס' יצירה בראו נקיבה והיו מטיילין עמה ויוסף לא ידע מזה והיה סובר שהיא נקיבה אשה מהאב ואם ובא והודיע לאביו שהם חשודים בעריות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The original <em>Midrash</em> says תּוֹלִין עֵינֵיהֶם בִּבְנוֹת הָאָרֶץ, they've laid their eyes on the women of the land. According to this, they weren't women of the land. I guess it depends if the issue was that they were Caananite women, or they were engaged in inappropriate relations (as Rashi seems to say).</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I found that the Chasam Sofer shares my concern:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא אאמין על שבטי י-ה שעסקו בשמות הקדושים על מנת לשעשע עם נקבה חלילה חלילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the way the  Shela says it, it doesn't seem like they had any type or relationship with the fake women at all. All Shela says that they did was walk with her. For whatever purpose they made her they had to walk with her somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Yosef, however, seeing them walk with her thought they were walking with a real woman. Knowing that the woman wasn't his SIL and thinking she was real he accused them of walking with a strange woman for illicit purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Had he known that created the women from Sefer Yetzirah he certainly would not have accused them so.No one who is on the madreiga to create a fake person from Sefer Yetzira is doing so for illicit purposes.</p>\n\n\n",

It's that the thing they're describing which causes someone to be \"called a sinner\" isn't really a sin. There is absolutely nothing in halacha that prevents a person from taking fasts upon himself. And there is no mitzvah among the 613 mitzvot in the Torah that says you must ask for mercy on behalf of everybody you can. Making vows is also not a sin on its own. In fact, just <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.203.6?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5 seifim after</a> the Shulchan Arukh says that someone who makes vows is \"called evil\" and \"called a sinner,\" he gives some examples where making a vow is recommended:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האומר אשנה פרק זה וירא שמא יתרשל בדבר שרי ליה למנדר לזרוזי נפשיה וכן אם ירא שיתקפו יצרו ויעבור על איזו מצוה ממצות לא תעשה או יתרשל מקיום מצות עשה מצוה לישבע ולנדור כדי לזרז עצמו:</p>\n<p>A person who says \"I will learn this perek, and is afraid lest they become negligent in this matter, it is appropriate for them to vow in order to quicken themselves. And so, if one is afraid that their [evil] inclination will attack them and they will transgress any commandment of the negative commandments, or become negligent in the fulfilment of a positive commandment, it is a commandment for that person to vow in order to quicken themself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are all examples of rabbis explaining what they believe is the proper way to act. Not following these directions is an expression of poor midos, and perhaps Hashem looks upon a person who does these things the same way he would look upon a sinner. But they're not formal halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

If they did legitimately think thatJoseph deserved the death penalty then we can perhaps apply the following passage from Berachot 10a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He brought sufferings upon Hezekiah and then said to Isaiah, Go visit the sick. For so it says, In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz, came to him and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die and not live etc. What is the meaning of ‘thou shalt die and not live’? Thou shalt die in this world and not live in the world to come. He said to him: Why so bad? He replied: Because you did not try to have children. <strong>He said: The reason was because I saw by the holy spirit that the children issuing from me would not be virtuous. He said to him: What have you to do with the secrets of the All-Merciful? You should have done what you were commanded, and let the Holy One, blessed be He, do that which pleases Him.</strong></p>\n<p>(Soncino translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Under this approach it doesn’t matter whether There are supposed to be 12 tribes or not. Man’s job is to fulfill his duties; it is God’s job to make sure everything happens in accordance with the master plan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One of the many explanations given of why they wanted to kill him in the first place, is that they thought he was planning to get them cursed and (thus) killed, etc. (See below link to another question with more explanations), and so they acted in self-defense. At this point, if Yosef would kill them, there wouldn't be 11 tribes, there would be only <strong>one</strong> tribe: Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>Yosef's two sons were part of the tribes.

It then appears there is no Teva to war, as it is not decided by the number or power of the force but Hashem’s will. If you assume that a miracle is the suspension of Teva, then in this case there is no miracle, for no Teva was present to be suspended.

He (Esau) nicknamed her Judith (יְהוּדִית) to imply that she denied the validity of idolatry, so that he might deceive his father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that the reason the name Yehudis was chosen because it signifies being like a Jew (Yehudi). But this name for Jews only started getting used around the time of the Babylonian exile (it is mentioned in Megillas Esther). It's unlikely that Esav prophetically foresaw this. So then why did he choose to name her after one particular son of Yaakov (Yehuda)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.13a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Gemarah (Megillah 13a)</a> states that the term Yehudi refers to one who rejects idolatry: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יוחנן אמר לעולם מבנימן קאתי ואמאי קרי ליה יהודי על שום שכפר בע\"ז שכל הכופר בע\"ז נקרא יהודי כדכתיב (דניאל ג, יב) איתי גוברין יהודאין וגו'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maharsha cites the Gemarah in Sotah 10a that the name 'Yehuda' is meant to include the four letters of God's name. The implication being that the root of the word connotes a repudiation of idolatry, not necessarily Jewishness though it came to mean that as well.</p>\n\n\n",

The Maharal explains that the rabbinic commandment of <em>eruv tavshilin</em> represents that we merit the ability to acquire merit for our positive choices in good times (corresponding to preparing for <em>Shabbath</em> on a preceding <em>yom tov</em> - which represent, respectively, the final merit of the world to come and the preceding messianic era) by demonstrating that we also make positive choices when times are hard - i.e. in this world, in exile (corresponding to preparing for Shabbath on the day before Yom Tov). </p>\n\n<p>The Maharal suggests that this is the reason the Talmud mentions that Abraham kept specifically this mitzva.  The passage is highlighting that, even though later in his life Abraham had it easy, so one might be tempted to think he was not so merit-worthy for his positive actions, he had already demonstrated his merit-worthiness during the many trials and tribulations of his younger years, and thus even his choices in easy times were also merit-worthy.</p>\n\n<p>According to this allegorical interpretation, there's no reason to assume that Abraham kept commandments that had not yet been received or enacted.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi is not discussing with his comment, <em>\"I do not know what this teaches us.\"</em>, the pillar at all. He is pointing out that the words, <em>‘where He spoke with him’</em> are redundant, meaning extra words, that are pointing to Avraham & Yitzchok & the covenant made there. The exact same expression \"בַּמָּק֛וֹם אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּ֖וֹ\" appears in the preceding posuk, Bereshit 35:13. Rashi is saying that he has no tradition about what this redundant reference is teaching aside from that it is pointing to Avraham and Yitzchok.</p>\n\n<p>This blessing of possessing the land was accomplished by Avraham and Yitzchok through the Akeida, which was a type of spiritual service that involved subjugating the Angel of Death via the ram that was sacrificed.</p>\n\n<p>This paradigm, which was established at the Akeida, is what is being done via a type of prayer by Yisrael Avinu in Bereshit 35:10.</p>\n\n<p>The word <em>matzevah</em> (מצבה) comes from the root יצב, which has a connotation of a type of prayer as referenced by Jastrow on the root quoting Pesikta Rabbati which is referencing Mishlei 22:29. (See also Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:1:1 and Shemot Rabbah 11:1)</p>\n\n<p>The stone mentioned here is referring to a letter being removed from the name of the Angel of Death. The letters of the Aleph-Beit are called <em>stones</em> in Sefer Yetzirah (4:16 Gra edition) which tradition teaches was given to us via Avraham Avinu.</p>\n\n<p>This removal of that single letter (the letter Mem, מ) from the name of the Angel of Death converts the severity (<em>harsh judgement</em> אלהים) associated with the Angel of Death into <em>softened judgement</em> (אכדטם). This type of letter transformation, converting the letters to the letter preceding it in alphabetical order, is the transformation associated with Avraham Avinu.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, when you see יהוה in the Amidah prayer connected to Avraham Avinu (Elohei Avraham), you intend טדהד. The transformation associated with Yitzchok Avinu is the opposite, meaning letters transform into the letter following it in alphabetical order.  So יהוה becomes כוזו. The transformation for Yaacov Avinu, Yisrael, is the At-Bash. So יהוה becomes מצפץ.</p>\n\n<p>This removal of that single letter from the name of the Angel of Death also converts the name of the Angel of Death into one of the <em>3 letter triplets</em> (ס״אל) from G-d's 72 triplet-letter name (It contains 72, three letter roots for a total of 216 letters.) That particular triplet is associated with G-d's Kingship like is explained by Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles in Sefer Kehillat Yaacov. This concept is also referenced in the name of the Ba'al Shem Tov in Sefer Keter Shem Tov. It's also worth noting that if you apply the letter transformation of Yaacov Avinu, meaning the At-Bash, to the three letters remaining from the Angel of Deaath's name, the result is the Angelic name referenced in the Talmud for the posuk from Ashrei that is associated with our daily parnussa (Tehillim 145:16).</p>\n\n<p>The <em>harsh judgement</em> is characterized by the red wine being poured out on the stone (<em>Red being associated with Gevurah/Severity.</em>). And the conversion to softened judgement is alluded to via the oil which follows.</p>\n\n<p>Shemen (שמן) is referring to (שם-נו״ן), that G-d's 6 letter name which is the union of אהיה and יהוה (these two names have a gematria sum of 50 when including the two names and kollel). But their union (אהיהוה) only has a gematria of 32. When including the kollel, the resulting sum is 33 (ג״ל or ל״ג, which is also the value of כד״ט from the softened judgement of אכדטם mentioned above) as in Lag b'Omer, the time between Passover and Shavuot when the decree on the students of Rabbi Akiva stopped. The harsh judgement was overturned.</p>\n\n<p>And this paradigm associated to 33, meaning <em>Gal</em> (גל) and the overturning of harsh judgement is repeated between Yaacov and Lavan at the Gal Eid (גל עד) and also with Moshe Rabbeinu and Pinchas in connection with the spear (הרמח, the Mem is from the Angel of Death and פינחס, like יצחק is gematria 208, ר״ח) used against Zimri and Kozbi.</p>\n\n<p>So what is being described in connection with Bereshit 35:14 is not a violation of the prohibition you quote from Devarim 16:22, but an affirmation of the paradigm established by Avraham Avinu at the binding of Yitzchok.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm looking into the subject of the part music played in worship dating from the time of David and Solomon. </p>\n\n<p>What sort of religious music would have existed prior to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem almost 2,000 years ago?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The question of music in Ancient Israel is complicated. First, since no transcriptions exist from that time, no one actually knows what it sounded like. Musical historians also debate the identity of biblical instruments (some of which have modern Hebrew meanings that shouldn't be confused with their ancient forms). Nevertheless, here's an attempt at an answer. </p>\n\n<p>Most of what is known about First Temple music derives from biblical references and the Jewish oral tradition. In the Hebrew Bible, for example, when King David installs the ark in Jerusalem (II Sam. 2:6), we are introduced to some of these ancient instruments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְדָוִ֣ד ׀ וְכָל־בֵּ֣ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל מְשַֽׂחֲקִים֙ לִפְנֵ֣י ה׳ בְּכֹ֖ל עֲצֵ֣י בְרוֹשִׁ֑ים וּבְכִנֹּר֤וֹת וּבִנְבָלִים֙ וּבְתֻפִּ֔ים וּבִמְנַֽעַנְעִ֖ים וּֽבְצֶלְצֶלִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Meanwhile, David and all the House of Israel danced before the LORD to\n  [the sound of] all kinds of cypress wood [instruments], with lyres,\n  harps, timbrels, sistrums, and cymbals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, it's important to emphasize that the quote above is a modern English translation (NJPS) of Hebrew instruments. The oral tradition, first collected in the Mishnah (e.g., Arakhin 2:3-6) and later expounded in the Talmud, discusses in detail the musical service conducted in the Temple. In addition to the choral Levite singers, at least twelve instruments were used on a daily basis, consisting of some arrangement of the stringed instruments known as the <em>nevel</em> [a multi-stringed lyre with a deep tone] and <em>kinor</em> [a smaller lyre with fewer strings], and the percussive <em>tziltzelim</em> [a kind of cymbal]; on holidays, two <em>halilim</em> [a kind of reed flute] were also used. </p>\n\n<p>The same oral source (Ar. 2:6) discusses the makeup of the choir:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֵין פּוֹחֲתִין מִשְּׁנֵים עָשָׂר לְוִיִּם עוֹמְדִים עַל הַדּוּכָן, וּמוֹסִיפִין עַד לְעוֹלָם. אֵין קָטָן נִכְנָס לָעֲזָרָה לַעֲבוֹדָה אֶלָּא בְשָׁעָה שֶׁהַלְוִיִּם עוֹמְדִים בַּשִּׁיר. וְלֹא הָיוּ אוֹמְרִים בְּנֵבֶל וְכִנּוֹר אֶלָּא בַפֶּה, כְּדֵי לִתֵּן תְּבַל בַּנְּעִימָה. רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר בֶּן יַעֲקֹב אוֹמֵר, אֵין עוֹלִין לַמִּנְיָן, וְאֵין עוֹמְדִים עַל הַדּוּכָן, אֶלָּא בָאָרֶץ הָיוּ עוֹמְדִין, וְרָאשֵׁיהֶן מִבֵּין רַגְלֵי הַלְוִיִּם, וְצוֹעֲרֵי הַלְוִיִּם הָיוּ נִקְרָאִין:</p>\n  \n  <p>There were never less than twelve levites standing on the platform and\n  their number could be increased into infinity. No minor could enter\n  the court of the sanctuary to take part in the service except when the\n  Levites stood up to sing. Nor did they join in the singing with harp\n  and lyre, but with the mouth alone, to add flavor to the music. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This source and others signal the voice as being of primary importance to ancient religious Jewish music. These sources do not explicitly state whether the choir of adults was accompanied by instruments while they sang, but the Mishnah does specify the requirement of balancing the number of instruments with the number of singers. </p>\n\n<p>To get a sense of what religious music sung in ancient Israel sounded like, here is the \"father\" of Jewish musicology, A. Z. Idelsohn's construction of a daily Temple service, based on the Mishnah sources:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After the priests on duty had recited a benediction, the Ten Commandments, the Shema (Deut. 6:4-9), the priestly benediction (Num. 6:22-26) and three other benedictions, they proceeded to the act of the offerings. And after they were through with the arrangement of the sacrifices, one of them sounded the <em>Magrepha</em> [a rake] which was the signal for the priests to enter the Temple to prostrate themselves, whereas for the Levite that sound marked the beginning of the musical performance. Two priests took their stand at the alter immediately and started to blow the trumpets <em>tekia-terua-tekia</em> [various blasts of sound]. After this performance, they approached Ben Arza, the cymbal player, and took their stand beside him, one at his right and the other at his left side. Whereupon, at a given sign with a flag by the superintendent, this Levite sounded his cymbal, and all the Levites began to sing a part of the daily Psalm [dependent on the day, as discussed in the Mishnah, Tamid 7:4]. Whenever they finished a part they stopped, and the priests repeated their blowing of the trumpets and the people present prostrated themselves. The texts sung by the Levites were not Psalms alone, but also portions of the Pentateuch. (from <em>Jewish Music: Its Historical Development</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Scholars infer what parts of what this Levite music sounded like from the Hebrew text of the Psalms, which might show call-and-response forms or refrains, the use of an unclear instrument (such as the <em>alamot</em> in Psalms 46), or the name of a forgotten scale (e.g., the <em>shminit</em> in Psalm 6). </p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What do we make of the witch of Endor?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah forbids necromancy [Lev. 19:31 and 20:6,27; Deut. 18:11].  Yet King Saul goes to the witch of Endor, who brings up the dead prophet Samuel for him.  Samuel responds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why have you disturbed me and brought me up? ... Why do you ask me, seeing that the Lord has turned away from you and has become your adversary? ... The Lord has torn the kingship out of your hands and has given it to your fellow, to David, because you did not obey the Lord and did not execute His wrath upon the Amalekites. That is why the Lord has done this to you today.  Further, the Lord will deliver the Israelites who are with you into the hands of the Philistines. Tomorrow your sons and you will be with me; and the Lord will also deliver the Israelite forces into the hands of the Philistines. [1Sam 28:15-19]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does traditional Judaism conclude from this story?</p>\n\n<p>(1) That there is an afterlife, and that communication with the dead is possible, but God does not want us to attempt it?</p>\n\n<p>(2) That necromancy is bogus and that the witch of Endor was a gifted ventriloquist? (But Samuel's prophecy was fulfilled.)</p>\n\n<p>Do you have sources, particularly for (2)? As for (1), did the rabbis actually mention that episode as a proof of an afterlife?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The story of the witch of En-dor in I Samuel 28 is obscure and seems rather strange. The Torah prohibits communication with the dead and yet Saul does just that. </p>\n\n<p>“So Saul disguised himself, dressed in other clothes, and he and two men went and came to the woman at night.” </p>\n\n<p>It is well known that mediums prefer to work at night since the darkness hides their schemes in which they use to trick their clients. Thus I argue here that the rising of Samuel was a trick by the witch.</p>\n\n<p>However, some Jews feel that the Torah prohibits magic, necromancy, idolatry, and witchcraft because they work. I even once heard a rabbi say that were the prohibition of talking to the dead only a fable the Torah would not have prohibited it.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra would disagree. Writing in his commentary to Leviticus, 19:31, he writes: \"Those with empty brains say 'Were it not that fortune tellers and magicians were true, the Torah would not prohibit them.' But I (Ibn Ezra) say just the opposite of their words, because the Torah doesn't prohibit that which is true, but it prohibits that which is false. And the proof is the prohibition on idols and statues.\"</p>\n\n<p>Additional sources who accepted the idea that witchcraft works were some talmudic rabbis (BT Sanhedrin 65a). Rashi, Radak, Altschuler, and Malbim accepted the Talmudic view. Saadiah, Hai Gaon, and Nachmanides felt that witchcraft does not always works, only on special occasions or when G-d allows. </p>\n\n<p>Yet others, such as the rationalist Jews, such as Maimonides, ibn Ezra, Gersonides, and Samuel ben Hofni Gaon contend that the witch tricked Saul by pretending to be rising Samuel out of the dead. They support their view with Saul's question of a description of what she saw (verse 13); he saw nothing and blindly accepted what she told him.</p>\n\n<p>If we accept the rational view that this was a trick then it would seem that part of her trick was to show her power in that she not only raised Samuel from the dead but recognized Saul in his new clothes. On the other hand, Saul did not see the Samuel. This is further evidence that she was tricking Saul. From this reading, we see that she did nothing. Radak writes that she knew who Saul was and that she was aware that he was seeking aid, specifically from Samuel.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is significant that Samuel allegedly rose out of the earth, not from heaven (above) as would be excepted. Even more significant is the fact that Samuel does not rebuke Saul for using divination. Further evidence that the witch was tricking him. For if it was really Samuel, he would be aware of Torah laws. For example, I Chronicles 10:13 recounts that Saul paid for his transgressions when violating Leviticus 20:27 (which states that they should be killed) and Deuteronomy 18:11 (which considers it an abomination, we are commanded to drive them off the land).</p>\n\n<p>Since it was a trick it follows that it was not a prophecy from Samuel, since this was not Samuel but a trick. Already showing signs of  weakness and insecurity, and dwelling in a daydream: “Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was greatly afraid and his heart trembled greatly.” (Samuel I, 28:5) Realizing that his next activity was war, Saul sought aid from useless idolatry. When he turned to fantasy and imagination, he began to see forces that did not exist. His insecure mind failed him in battle which led to his ultimate death.</p>\n\n\n",

When the daughters of Israel come out of the mikvah, let them look at me, that they may bear sons as beautiful and as learned as I am. [Bava Metzia 84a]</p>\n<p>Rabbi Eleazar fell ill and Rabbi Yochanan went in to visit him… He noticed that… Rabbi Eleazar was weeping, and he said to him: Why do you weep?... He replied to him: I am weeping on account of this beauty [of yours] that is going to rot in the earth. He said to him: On that account you surely have a reason to weep.  And they both wept.  [Berachot 5b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hear rabbis comparing the beauty of various women:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbis taught: There have been four women of exceptional beauty in the world:  Sarah, Rahav, Abigail and Esther…\nRabbi Joshua ben Korha said: [Actually, I heard that] Esther was sallow, [even though she was] endowed with great charm.  [In that case, they said], Vashti should replace Esther in the list.\nOur Rabbis taught: Rahav inspired lust by her name [alone] ... Rabbi Isaac said: Whoever says “Rahav, Rahav!” has an immediate orgasm. Rabbi Nahman said to him: I say “Rahav, Rahav!”, and nothing happens to me.

You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk(NJPS with adaptations).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last time I checked chickens do not produce any type of milk. and the explanation given to me was that someone across the street could see me eating a chicken with a cheese sandwich and think that its a beef with a cheese sandwich and that is why we do not mix poultry and dairy.</p>\n\n<p>Now to my question\nwith that logic that is probably wrong how is Imitation Crabmeat Kosher. It looks like crab, and there is no way anyone in a blind test tells them apart without directly looking at the packaging. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The issue with chicken isn't about what observers think about your sandwich.  Rabbinic writings (that I will have to come back and cite later, sorry) record ways in which chicken is similar enough to red meat to be subject to the same rules.  I do recall that possible confusion was part of the discussion, but as best I recall, that was more about the contents of stews, not intact drumsticks or the like.  But the <em>halacha</em> applies regardless of the form the food takes.</p>\n\n<p>Appearances (in general, not just for meat and milk) <em>do</em> matter; there is a <em>halachic</em> concept called <em>marit 'ayin</em>, which is, loosely, giving the wrong (negative) impression.  It's because of <em>marit 'ayin</em> that if you serve almond milk with meat, you leave some pieces of almond in. (That's a medieval example.)  A modern application is that if you serve those fake \"bacon bits\" alongside a salad, you do so in the original packaging, not by putting them in a separate bowl.  I've seen margarine served with bread in its packaging, to demonstrate that it is not butter.</p>\n\n<p>Proper labeling mitigates confusion caused by either natural similarity (like margarine vs. butter) or intentional imitation (like almond milk or fake bacon bits).  We are allowed to eat things that <em>resemble</em> non-kosher items; we're just not allowed to eat <em>actual</em> non-kosher items.</p>\n\n<p>Imitation crabmeat falls into this category.  So long as it has a <em>hechsher</em> (kosher certification), meaning it does not contain actual shellfish, it's fine to eat.  (Do be warned, though, that many \"imitation\" crabmeat products do contain some shellfish for flavoring; it's not actual crab but it has crab in it.  That's not kosher.  Look for the <em>hechsher</em> to be sure.)</p>\n\n\n",

Of course if he removes an eye or defects the sculpture, he is not suspect of worshipping the statue and can subsequently keep it, as long as it has not been worshipped which is usually the case nowadays:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשם שאסור לעשותן כך אסור לומר לנכרי לעשותן דאמירה לנכרי שבות בכל המצות ואפי' להשהותן אסור משום חשד (ש\"ך ס\"ק כ\"ג) ונ\"ל דצורת אדם בזמה\"ז מותר לשהותן דכיון דאינו אלא משום חשד וידוע דבזמה\"ז אין עובדין לצורת אדם ואותו שנעבד עושין אותו משונה וכן מתלמידיו העבדים יש בכל א' מהן סימן ואלו ודאי אסור להשהותן אבל שאר צורת אדם ומכ\"ש אם סימא עיניו וכיוצא בו דאין בו משום חשד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>My rabbi bought a bronze statue of the famed Greek pagan philosopher Aristotle. He did not make any defects in the statue and it is likely that a gentile crafted it. He does not consider it an idol despite what Maimonides says. He bought the statue because Aristotle is one of his favorite philosophers, as well as a rationalist. Aristotle taught Alexander the Great and later Maimonides who inspired many. Maimonides would later teach Jews Greek truths.</p>\n\n<p>True, the Torah verse 16:22 prohibits the use of pillars \"that the L-rd your G-d hates,\" and 12:3, \"You must break down their [Canaanites] altars and break their pillars.\" However, Exodus 24:4 informs us that Moses wrote the words of G-d at Mount Sinai \"and rose up early in the morning and built an altar under the mountain and twelve pillars equaling the number of the twelve Israelite tribes.\" The patriarchs also built pillars in Genesis. Is there a contradiction in the Bible?</p>\n\n<p>Actually, the Bible is only prohibiting the use of pillar associated with idolatry (ibn Ezra). Rashi ignores Moses' acts when he relies on Midrash Sifrei, \"although he loved them [the pillars] during the day of the patriarchs, he hates them now because these [the Canaanites] used them for their idol worship practice.\" Rashi opines that verse 16:22 bans all pillars even though the plain reading of the text shows that G-d banned only pillars \"the L-rd your G-d hates.\" G-d does not dislike statues.</p>\n\n<p>But isn't this a violation of the Decalogue which states: “Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness”? Yes, it is. But my rabbi explained that most, if not all the biblical commands were changed. for example, contrary to the second prohibition, all rabbis allow making and owning pictures and statutes. Be it as it may, many ancient synagogues had statues like modern cathedrals today. In fact, Rabbi Marc Shapiro claims that ancient talmudic books had an image of G-d depicted as a man — G-d forbid.</p>\n\n<p>In respect to statues of humans, I agree with my orthodox rabbi and think the Chochmat Adam is correct to say that Jews do not worship idols today so we need not worry. </p>\n\n\n",

However, in this very paragraph the Talmud cites an exception wherein a later court <em>can</em> overrule an earlier court – namely where the later court is greater in both wisdom and number. Why, then, does the Talmud here assume that a later court couldn't have changed the rules of when Megillat Esther can be read?

He settled the people of one city in another. There was no need for Scripture to state this except for the purpose of telling you something to Joseph’s credit — that he intended thereby to remove a reproach from his brothers because, since the Egyptians were themselves strangers in the various cities where they then dwelt, they could not call them (Joseph’s brethren) strangers (Chullin 60b).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that he moved everyone from one city to another as a unit. As a result, the people still were able to maintain their unity, but still considered that the land was owned by Par'o. This is similar to what the Assyrians did when they conquered the Northern Kingdom and moved everyone as a unit. Thus, everyone regarded the land as belonging to the state and could not regard the land they were on as their own. In fact their loyalty changed from considering it their own land to regarding it as land that Par'o owned and which he magnanimously allowed them to farm for <em>only</em> 20%.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The whole land had become state property, and to make this newly\n  acquired rite completely actual, every owner had to leave property\n  that hitherto had been his own and move to another district, so that a\n  general evacuation took place. But Joseph's wisdom tempered the edict by\n  arranging that the residents who had always been together remained\n  together and found themselves still together with their friends but\n  only in a fresh environment. So that the old social and communal\n  conditions remained the same, and there was no complete upheaval by\n  the change. Our sages point out the beneficial result that this\n  transition must have had for the new arrivals, the family of Jacob, to\n  whom henceforth no Egyptian could look down with disdain as newcomers.\n  For no Egyptian either was an \"old inhabitant\" on his native hearth\n  The people themselves had proposed it, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8242/showrashi/true#v19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">v.\n  19</a>,\n  and indeed at the same time actual bondage.

He only needs to pay a kalbon when he <em>lends</em> his friend a half shekel.</p>\n<p>However, both this mishna and the next, and Kehati, do not specify when one is patur if he pays for a kohen etc. In a case where he lends them a half-shekel, or in a case where he gives it as a present? To make this even more confusing, this halacha( that he doesn’t need to pay a kalbon if he gives for himself and a kohen) is mentioned right before the Halacha when he <em>lends</em> a kalbon to his friend, but in the language of <em>giving as a predent</em> (על ידי).</p>\n<p>So does a man need to pay a kalbon if he lends a half-shekel to a kohen, or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Melehes Shlomo quotes Rav Shlomo Surelio that <strong>lending the Cohen does not require a Kalbon</strong> (i.ewhen one pays a full Shekel for himself and the Kohen expecting the Kohen to pay him back half a Shekel)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וע\"י כהן פטור. כך כתב לשון המשנה החכם הר\"ש שיריליו ז\"ל: ופי' דהא קמ\"ל דאע\"ג דבהלואה הוא דיהיב להו ולימא כיון דהתחיל במצוה אומרים לו מרוק וליחייב בקולבון קמ\"ל דמיפטר דלא עדיף מכי יהיב כהן או עבד גופיה שקל להקדש</p>\n  \n  <p>One is exempt from paying a Kalbon (surcharge) on behalf of a Kohen - even when only lending him.

Due to some personal experiences, I have come to believe in G-d, his primacy and power, and the authority of the Torah. Still, I am unable to act continuously in a manner consistent with the fact that G-d exists and is watching me. Perhaps it is my Moral failure. </p>\n\n<p>Q1) Why is it so hard to follow God's word and believe in him, continuously in time such that my thoughts/actions are always, CONTINUOUSLY in accordance with the moral law of the Torah and the Talmud?</p>\n\n<p>Q2) How would you explain the concept of the soul to a scientific materialist?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Start with the brain... Okay, the brain, the pituitary gland... Okay, we have to bring in a lot more bio than just the brain in order to get brain chemistry just down. For example, behavior changes with the level of activity of one's adrenal glands... Or the amount of alcohol that made it through the gut and into the bloodstream. So, let me try again.</p>\n\n<p>Start with the body. There is some organizational pattern to your body that shapes how thinking happens in your brain and central nervous system. The wiring in your neurons is a big part of it, as is chemistry. All of those patterns encode information; the thinking happens with the patterns more than the substance of the neurons and brain chemistry.</p>\n\n<p>And with that life-ness comes intellectual demands -- drives for sex, food, rest and physical comfort, etc...</p>\n\n<p>Those are a little harder to map to the physics, chemistry, biology, anatomy and neuroscience, but it still seems doable. One level more abstract than just talking about the design of the parts rather than the parts themselves.</p>\n\n<p>It is this level of abstraction that Qabbalists start talking about the nefesh. It's the bit that deals with the emotions that our chemistry sweeps past us, the physical drives and wants.... Basically, everything that is animal or specifically mammalian about our thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that in this worldview, there is no line between the physical and the metaphysical. It's gradual, more of a spectrum than a dichotomy.</p>\n\n<p>In Qabbalah's model, the Or Ein Sof (the Light of the Infinite One / the Infinite Light) \"descends\" from world to world, getting implemented in ever more coarse forms. In the Rambam's model (Yesodei haTorah ch. 2) Hashem had a Thought, which had a thought, etc... A chain of intellects that runs down the various classes of angel through the spheres, and eventually down to us. In his Kelalim, the Leshem argues that the similarities are there because these are indeed two different models of same Truth.</p>\n\n<p>And it's a gradualist metaphysics. If we were to continue this train of going up one more level of abstraction after another, we would get to a \"world\" in which Liberty, Justice, Truth, are more relevant categories for describing why a decision was made than if we tried explaning a person's actions by describing the sodium ion levels and whatnot at various neurons.</p>\n\n<p>It's like answering the question about why a pixel on your monitor went red. You could discuss the gate that flipped in your display in response to a voltage level on the cable, in response to various logic gates flipping inside your computer's video card, etc... Or, you could discuss the notion of trying to balance your checkbook in Excel, and unfortunately, you're overdrawn. Neither are wrong. Neither is more real. However, if you want to solve the real underlying problem in your life, talking about budgeting is more useful.</p>\n\n<p>On the top of the chain of abstraction is Good (as we say in the Shemoneh Esrei \"הטוב שמך -- Your name / reputation is 'the Good One'), the Cause of All Existence (to literally translate the tetragrammaton). The Giver of everything, including our very being.</p>\n\n<p>And our connection \"10 tefachim below the Throne\", is where the neshamah begins.</p>\n\n<p>People are uniquely in the Image of the Divine because we operate on all these different planes at once. We can think about the nefesh's desire for a lava cake and the neshamah's desire to live a meaningful life that advances Good in this world.</p>\n\n<p>And so in the levels between them we have the ruach. Where these desires meet and conflict, we have to think things out. As R Dessler puts it, the nequdas habechirah -- the free-will point -- is at the battle-front between physical desire and Truth. We have conscious thought. If the ruach is in the physical world, and the neshamah is in heaven, the ruach is in the world between our ears.</p>\n\n<p>All of which is gradualist. It's not instead of believing in the brain. It's thinking of the brain as the slide-show on the wall, where the soul is the beam of light that casts the image. (And in this mashal, tzimtzum is the film which blocks the parts of the Or Ein Sof that don't belong in the world, but now I'm going even further afield.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, to try to answer your first question:</p>\n\n<p>What is most tzelem E-lokim, Image of the Divine about us is our ability to self-define who we are. It's not the neshamah, it's the tension between the neshamah and the nefesh from which the ruach emerges. No matter how high up the ladder of existence we would go, we would still be infintesimally above zero compare to an Infinite Deity. We balance physical and spiritual, bad and good, and even different goods -- for example the discipline of tact and knowing how to balance Peace and Truth. Our most transcendent aspect is our very ability to transcend. The fact that we can climb, and don't just exist in a single olam, at a single plane of abstraction.</p>\n\n<p>Which means G-d doesn't want it to be easy. The whole thing requires that tension between different ways of looking at the world.</p>\n\n<p>In short: why is it so hard? Because the greatest good is growth, not level.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To answer Question 2: </p>\n\n<p>Imagine you are trying to see how many chipmunks you can fit into your refrigerator. You are able to make some room between the orange juice and the milk on the top shelf to fit one there. There is also a bit of room in the cheese drawer to fit one snugly in there. You can fit two in the vegetable crisper. You wonder if you could fit one on the bottom shelf if you utilize a more efficient yogurt stacking pattern. Meanwhile, you realize that you haven't had lunch and all this looking in the refrigerator is making you hungry. You think about what kind of sandwich you might want to have for lunch, maybe some avocado toast with jam. Your mouth begins to water.</p>\n\n<p>-- Until now, your stream of consciousness was what we would call the \"Ruach\" participating in an abstract mental challenge that is totally disjoint from your physical body. However, the part of you that chimed in to let your consciousness know that you were hungry was your \"Nefesh\", the part of the soul that is intimitely connected to the physical body and advocates for it. The Nefesh pulls your consciousness (Ruach) to be concerned with the desires of your physical body, in this case, eating. --</p>\n\n<p>You continue looking for a space to place an additional chipmunk, perhaps in the door, while in the meantime one of the chipmunks in the vegetable crisper runs out. You look around to follow where it has gone off to, when the thought pops in your head: \"Maybe there is something better that I can be doing with my time other than putting chipmunks in a refrigerator.\"</p>\n\n<p>-- This last interruption is a result of the Neshama, that interacts with your consciousness to pull it to think about the more important things of purpose and meaning. --</p>\n\n<p>Chazal refers a person's consciousness as \"Ruach\", which means wind, because just as wind seems to easily change directions from one direction to another, so too our consciousness  is easily pulled back and forth between dealing with lofty questions of timeless meaning, to dealing with ephemeral pleasures. The Neshama pulls one's Ruach in one direction, the Nefesh pulls it in the other. Over the course of a life one may choose to silence their Neshama and let their Nefesh pull their Ruach lower and lower, or alternatively to listen to their Neshama and try to keep their mind primarily occupied with things of high importance like God and Torah thereby pulling their Ruach higher and higher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think you answered your own question.

    "title": "Did God want converts in the early days of Judaism?",
    "content": "# Did God want converts in the early days of Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash says that Abraham and Sarah made many converts, presumably with God's blessing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abraham made converts, for it is written, \"And Abraham took Sarai his wife... and all the souls that they had made in Haran.\" [Gen. 12:5]  R. Eleazar observed in the name of R. Yosei ben Zimra: If all the nations assembled to create one insect, they could not give it life, yet you say, \"And all the souls that they had made in Haran!\" It refers to the converts. \n  Then let [the Torah] say, \"That they had converted\".  Why \"That they had made?\" That is to teach you that if one brings a convert near [God], it is as though he had created him. Now why does it not say \"That he had made\" instead of \"That they had made\"?  Said R. Hunia: Abraham converted the men and Sarah the women. [Genesis Rabbah 84:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But elsewhere the Midrash says that God did not want converts to join the Israelites in the Exodus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The Torah says: The Lord spoke to Moses, “Hurry down, for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted.” [Ex. 32:7]]\n  [God said:]  It does not say <em>the</em> people but <em>your</em> people.  Moses exclaimed: Lord of the Universe! On what basis are they my people? God replied: They are indeed your people, for when they were yet still in Egypt, I told you that I will bring forth My legions, My people, the children of Israel [Ex. 7:4]. Did I not tell you not to allow a mixed multitude to be mingled with them? But you, being humble and righteous, responded to Me, “Those who repent must always be accepted.” Now, I knew what they would do [to Israel] in the future, but did I tell you that [to change your mind]? No, I fulfilled your wish, and the result was that it was just these people who made the [Golden] Calf, for they had been idol worshipers [before]. [Exodus Rabbah 42:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So which is it?  Did God want converts or not before the Jews became a nation?</strong>  Was God telling Moses, in effect, \"Before you can teach others, you have to learn yourselves.  Wait until I give you the Torah, wait until you live with it for a while and make it part of your lives, wait until you can stand firmly on your own two feet, and then you can bring strangers into the fold.  Right now, the strangers are more likely to influence you than you are to influence them.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The problem with Moshe's converts was that they were a foreign community grafted into the Jewish community. By that time the Jewish nation was well-defined and had its distinctive character, and that was compromised by bringing in the Erev Rav who brought their Egyptian culture into the Jewish nation.</p>\n\n<p>In Avaraham and Sarah's case there was no Jewish nation, and their converts were not joining their clan. We never see any reference to them after they joined Avaraham in his journey to Canaan. (We probably should not call them 'converts' at all.) These people learned of Avraham's idea of the One God and His expectations of humanity, but they either formed their own community, or took these ideas back to their communities. Avraham was spreading the message of God and His Law, which was good, but without bringing the foreign culture into the Jewish nation, which is not desired.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>No, because the practice of conversion did yet not exist, not even in the days of Abraham. </p>\n\n<p>Many rabbis cite 12:5, “and the nefesh that they had gotten in Haran.” True, the post-biblical translation of nefesh is “soul,” and so they are supporting the notion that the practice of conversion existed, when they say that “Abraham brought converts [the altered souls] that he converted in Haran.” Actually, the biblical word for nefesh does not denote “soul,” it is a “person.” Thus, it seems clear that nefesh in 12:5 refers to servants or slaves.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Ruth did not convert. When she said in 1:16, that “your G-d is my G-d,” she was not talking about conversion. In those days, people felt that different gods held authority over different nations, and Ruth was saying that when she come to Israel she will be under the authority of a different G-d, the G-d of Israel; besides, she never undergoes any conversion ceremony. Additionally, around the fourth century BCE Ezra and Nehemiah told the Judeans to send their non-Judean wives away; if conversion existed there would have been no need to banish them; they could have converted. In fact, the first time we see conversions happening is around 150 BCE, with John Hyrcanus. Saying that the practice of conversion did not exist in the days of Abraham should not prompt Jews to dissuade converts seeking to join Judaism today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>The popular practice of conversion probably didn't exist until 125 BCE when the Hasmonean King John Hyrcanus mandated a forced-conversion of the Edomites. It, therefore, follows that Ruth probably did not convert to Judaism. She is never called a convert nor a Jews. She is called a Moabit several times. She even refers to herself as a nokhria, a “foreigner.\" Additionally, there is no procedure or ceremony explained for the practice of conversion in the Torah. If there was a procedure, why did Ezra and Nehemiahfelt tell the Israelite men to send away their non-Jewish wives and children? </p>\n\n<p>Abraham (himself a non-Jew) taught philosophy and the divine truth that G-d is one to anyone willing to listen at his tent. Although there is no mention of the practice of conversion in the Bible, this should not prompt Jews to abandon the ritual nor dissuade converts away from Judaism. Many famous rabbis were proselytes, including Rabbi Akiva.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding Moshe, the Torah tells us that they left Egypt in a mixed-multitude. Persumbilly, these people, as well as the Hebrews, became Israelites at Sinai. This is the only reference I can find for a mass-conversion pre-Hyrcanus. </p>\n\n<p>As for Midrash, they are parables, not to be taken literally. Rambam writes that those who take Midrash at face-value are fools while those who dismiss them are also fools. Midrash are parables and while not true, they are still true, in a sense, by the lessons they teach.</p>\n\n\n",

If at all possible though, the husband should try to hear the blessings on the lighting from another person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if a man does not light on the first night, when he does light on a subsequent night, he says a shehechyanu. It seems that a woman's lighting fulfills some household obligation, but does not fully remove from him the \"newness\" of actual lighting. </p>\n\n<p>But what about the reverse?</p>\n\n<p>If a woman relies on her husband's lighting <em>(ner ish ubeiso</em> or <em>ishto k'gufo</em> as the logic) on the first night and then has cause to light on a later night, <strong>does she then say a shehechyanu?</strong> While it is her \"first\" lighting, she has already been included in the mitzvah through her husband's lighting and unlike the case of her husband, she need not even try to light on her own – her obligation seems more fully fulfilled.</p>\n\n\n",

(and there is no mitzvah to have a meal on Hanukka as on Purim (some say because many Jews died in the war).</p>\n\n<p>What is the history of the greeting '<strong>Happy</strong> Hanukka'?<br>\nWhen was it first used?<br>\nIs there a proof that it is a kosher greeting/wish?</p>\n\n<p>(The question is not regarding the English word but the idea of happiness in the context of the holiday.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Chanuka is definitely a time for happiness and rejoicing.</p>\n<p>The Rambam (Chanuka Perek 3) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומפני זה התקינו חכמים שבאותו הדור שיהיו שמונת ימים האלו שתחלתן כ\"ה\nבכסלו ימי שמחה והלל</p>\n<p>As a result, the Sages of the Generation decreed that the eight days beginning with 25th >Kislev shall be days of <strong>happiness and praise</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A possible source for this Rambam is Megillas Antiochus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על כן נדרו בני חשמונאי את הנדר הזה ואסרו את האיסר הזה, הם וכל בני\nישראל, להודיע לבני ישראל <strong>לעשות שמונה ימים אלה שמחה ויקר כימי החגים\nהכתובים בתורה</strong>, להדליק בהם, להודיע למי שיבא אחריהם, כי עשה להם אלהיהם\nהצלה מן השמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the classic Yiddish greeting on Chanuka is '<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%90%D6%B7_%D7%A4%D6%BF%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9B%D7%9F_%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">א פריילעכן חנוכה</a>', which means a 'Happy Chanukah'.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The earliest 2 sources for Chanukah are the talmud in Shabbos 21b and the Al Hanisim prayer. Both of these mention Praise and Thanksgiving, but neither mentions happiness per se.</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems clear for another reason that Chanukah is associated with happiness specifically. We recite Hallel, which is an expression of joy. Rambam writes in משנה תורה, הלכות מגילה וחנוכה  in law <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Scroll_of_Esther_and_Hanukkah.3.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:6</a> that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְלֹא הַלֵּל שֶׁל חֲנֻכָּה בִּלְבַד הוּא שֶׁמִּדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים אֶלָּא קְרִיאַת הַהַלֵּל לְעוֹלָם מִדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים בְּכָל הַיָּמִים שֶׁגּוֹמְרִין בָּהֶן אֶת הַהַלֵּל. וּשְׁמוֹנָה עָשָׂר יוֹם בַּשָּׁנָה מִצְוָה לִגְמֹר בָּהֶן אֶת הַהַלֵּל. וְאִלּוּ הֵן. שְׁמוֹנַת יְמֵי הֶחָג. וּשְׁמוֹנַת יְמֵי חֲנֻכָּה. וְרִאשׁוֹן שֶׁל פֶּסַח וְיוֹם עֲצֶרֶת. אֲבָל רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה וְיוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים אֵין בָּהֶן הַלֵּל לְפִי שֶׁהֵן יְמֵי תְּשׁוּבָה וְיִרְאָה וָפַחַד לֹא יְמֵי שִׂמְחָה יְתֵרָה. וְלֹא תִּקְּנוּ הַלֵּל בְּפוּרִים שֶׁקְּרִיאַת הַמְּגִלָּה הִיא הַהַלֵּל:</p>\n  \n  <p>And it is not only the Hallel of Chanukah that is from the words of\n  the Scribes. Rather the reading of the Hallel is always from the words\n  of the Scribes on all of the days in which we complete the Hallel. And\n  it is a commandment to complete the Hallel on eighteen days in the\n  year. And these are them: The eight days of the Festival (Sukkot);\n  eight days of Chanukah; the first day of Passover; and the day of\n  [Shavuot]. <strong>But there is no Hallel on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur\n  because they are days of repentance, awe and fear - not days of\n  excessive joy.</strong> And they did not ordain Hallel on Purim, because the\n  Scroll [of Esther that is read on it] is the Hallel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The clear implication is that all days of Hallel are indeed days of excessive joy. Thus happy chanukah is a highly appropriate greeting.</p>\n\n<p>Your friends idea is from shulchan aruch who writes in OC <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.670.2?with=Mishnah%20Berurah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">670:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ריבוי הסעודות שמרבים בהם הם סעודות הרשות שלא קבעום למשתה ושמחה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and Mishnah Berurah comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(ו) שלא קבעום למשתה ושמחה - אלא להלל ולהודות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but it seems that this statement is meant relative to purim and other festive days, but not that Chanukah is not a happy time at all.</p>\n\n\n",

But we do not say the whole Hallel on the final 6 days of Pesach which would seem to elevate Chanukah (a rabbinic institution) over Pesach, a biblical salvation. Why is the rabbinic holiday (on which many of the enemy died) \"happier\" than the biblical existential event? </p>\n\n<p>I understand that there are other <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/5712/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reasons</a> or thinking explaining why we don't say the whole of Hallel on the 6 days of Pesach but they seem to revolve around the Musaf (as compared to the days of Sukkot) but Chanukah has no Musaf attached to it so I don't understand why it would be elevated (to a position higher than Rosh Chodesh also) via that logic either.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Pesach night was followed by a difficult journey which caused many complaints. To rectify that we sing Dayenu during the Pesach seder, which indeed follows by a full Hallel. The Chanukkah celebration also followed by a difficult military war for the next 25 years, however Jewish people not only did not complain, but thanked Hashem for the miracle of oil.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As explained in a shiur that I attended today, each day of Chanukah is a separate mitzvah.

Because the Holy One will return it to Yisrael in the future.</p>\n\n<p>In light of this, how is the context of Isaiah 66:17 to be understood?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With fire and with sword the Lord will judge all humanity;\n      many will be slain by the Lord.\n  Those who became holy and purify themselves, following their leader into the gardens, who eat pork, detestable animals, and mice, will meet their end together, says the Lord. Because of their actions and thoughts, I’m coming to gather all nations and cultures. They will come to see my glory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The full quote from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Kiddushin.49b?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ritva</a> is very interesting, but also makes your question a non question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תשעה נטלו חזירים. יש שפירשו עמלק כדכתיב בו יכרסמנה חזיר מי<sup>ע</sup>ר ועליהם אמרו בהגדה למה נקרא שמו חזיר שעתיד הקב\"ה להחזירו לישראל לעתיד לבוא. ואין צורך לכך כי בספר הטבעים כתב שהצרעת ונגעים בחזירים הרבה בטבע:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the 9 out of ten measures of tzaraas in the world that the pig took mentioned in Kidushin 49b the Ritva wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are those that explain [this pig to mean] Amalek as it is written \"wild boars gnaw at it\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.80.14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">psalms 80:14</a>. And upon them they expounded in Agada \"why is its name 'Chazir', since Hashem shall return him to us in the the future\". But there is no need for this as the books on nature write tzaraas and afflictions are many and natural in pigs.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(My translation)</p>\n\n<p>So interestingly the drasha of the 'pig' returning in the future was brought by Ritva as not referring to the animal known as the pig, but rather referring to the nation known as Amalake. </p>\n\n<p>The Ritva ended off by saying this drasha is unnecessary for reading the gemara due to scientific knowledge, but the way he brought the drasha means the pig will not actually become kosher again. </p>\n\n<p>(It's not clear to me what source he is referring to.

But the point is, that he says that it's a minhag that was started by the ancients, long ago.*</p>\n<p>On latkes, Rabbi Dr. Chaim Simons traced the origins of eating latkes or levivot in Hebrew, in an essay in Hebrew titled \"<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210507034753/http://www.chaimsimons.net/cheesechanukah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The consumption of cheese and levivot on Chanukah</a>\". In it he says that a 1402 manuscript of Sefer Yehudit says that one of the foods that Yehudit fed the Greek ruler were levivot. Levivot are first mentioned in the story of Amnon and Tamar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיִּשְׁכַּ֥ב אַמְנ֖וֹן וַיִּתְחָ֑ל וַיָּבֹ֨א הַמֶּ֜לֶךְ לִרְאֹת֗וֹ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אַמְנ֤וֹן אֶל־הַמֶּ֙לֶךְ֙ תָּֽבוֹא־נָ֞א תָּמָ֣ר אֲחֹתִ֗י <strong>וּתְלַבֵּ֤ב לְעֵינַי֙ שְׁתֵּ֣י לְבִב֔וֹת</strong> וְאֶבְרֶ֖ה מִיָּדָֽהּ׃</p>\n<p>Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. The king came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, “Let my sister Tamar come and <strong>prepare a couple of cakes</strong> in front of me, and let her bring them to me.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the word \"ותלבב\", Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ותלבב. ותחלוט, סולת מורבכת במים רותחין תחלה, ואחר כך בשמן:</p>\n<p>She made a paste. She made a paste of flour mixed [it] first into boiling water and afterwords in oil.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.13.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_II_Samuel.13.8.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Shmuel 2:13:8</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Metzudat David writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ותבשל. עוד פעם על המחבת בשמן:</p>\n<p>Once more on the pan with oil.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.13.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_II_Samuel.13.8.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metuzdat David, Shmuel 2:13:8</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the words \"ותקח המשרת - She took the pan\", the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.13.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Sanhedrin.21a.21&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 21a</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" and she should dress the food in my sight…And she took the pan and poured them out before him” (II Samuel 13:4–5, 9). <strong>Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: This means that Tamar prepared various kinds of fried [tiggun] food for Amnon</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so writes Rabbi Simons:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"From all of this we see that the levivot are what we call today \"sufganiyot\". We will point out that among the foods that were with Yehudit were the ingredients to make levivot - Meaning, wheat and oil.</p>\n<p>Due to the feeding of slices of milk (cheese) to Holofrins, the poskim wrote that it's traditional to eat cheese (or milk products) on Chanukah. We must therefore ask, if so, where is it mentioned to eat levivot on Chanukah?</p>\n<p>In the halachic books and books of traditions (not including the books printed in our time!), the consumption of levivot in Chanukah isn't mentioned at all, but in songs and hymns it is mentioned. The first to mention the consumption of levivot on Chanukah was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalonymus_ben_Kalonymus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Kalonymus ben Kalonymus</a> who lived around 700 years ago. In one of his songs (published in Sefer Even Habochen V'derech Hayashar to R' Kalonymus ben Kalonymus) he wrote:</p>\n<p>\"In the 9th month in Kislev:</p>\n<p>A peaceful cry of the masses:</p>\n<p>To Matity' ben Yochanan and not for shame:</p>\n<p>And to the Son of Chashmonai:</p>\n<p>And the important women collected:</p>\n<p>Knowledgeable in the making of the food and preparation of the levivot:</p>\n<p>Large wagons like the circumference of the pan:</p>\n<p>And their sight [as] good as my wine and their order like the sight of the rainbow:</p>\n<p>[They] bake the dough and all sorts of goods they make from the dough:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.36b.18?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chavits in the pot as well as pounded grain</a>:</p>\n<p>And on top of all they shall make flour of wheat:\"</p>\n<p>Hundreds of years later, in the beginning of the 17th century, the book Shtei Yadot by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_Lonzano\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachem de Lonzano</a> was published...in the fourth part of the song he writes:\n\"Levivot with cheese on Chanukah, wafers in honey light for my candle.\" We see that according to Lunzano it was traditional to eat levivot with cheese on Chanukah, a famous dish at the time.</p>\n<p>Also, there's a song for Shabbat Chanukah written by \"Avraham\" - some say Avraham ibn Ezra was the author and others not. The song begins with \"Eat choice foods (משמנים)  and fine flour cooked with oil\" and brings all sorts of foods for the meal of Shabbat Chanukah. Some of the foods that appear in the song are foods known from other Shabbat songs, year-round, such as \"swans\" and \"eat choice foods (משמנים)\". But what is \"fine flour cooked with oil\"? Per Rashi's explanation of the meaning of the word \"ותלבב\", it's possible that the meaning of \"fine flour cooked with oil\" that is mentioned in the song is levivot (another option is that it is couscous, eaten on Chanukah by the Algerian Jews etc).</p>\n<p>We are left therefore with question of why only the consumption of cheese on Chanukah is mentioned by the \"Kolbo\" and the Ra\"n and the consumption of levivot isn't mentioned? As an answer, there's room to suggest that the reason that the \"Kolbo\" wrote \"a dish of cheese\" and not <strong>just</strong> \"cheese\" is that he was referring to the dish of \"levivot filled with cheese\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, we see from here that like the custom of sufganiyot, the custom of eating levivot/latkes on Chanukah is also quite ancient, perhaps even from the time of Yehudit herself (that really depends on why the 1402 translation of Yehudit chose to translate the list of foods as including levivot (as discussed in the first section of that essay, different manuscripts listed different foods)), but the custom is certainly at least as old as Rabbi Kalonymus ben Kalonymus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*For more info on the minhag of eating sufganiyot, see \"<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=64355&pgnum=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Emek Hasufganim</a>\".</p>\n\n\n",

And in the morning the king sent for ‎Joseph, and the servants of the king went and brought Joseph before Pharaoh. And the king ‎went unto all his princes and servants who were to sit before the king, and Joseph ascended ‎the steps of the throne, and Joseph spoke unto the king in all the tongues, speaking unto the ‎king in his going up, until he reached the king on the seventieth step, and he sat down before ‎the king.

    "content": "# On the halachic level, does the sexual intercourse between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman married to a Gentile man constitute adultery or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian noahide.</p>\n\n<p>As is known, the Torah prohibits marriage between Jews and Gentiles, and in general sexual intercourses between them. There is, except for my mistake, the exception concerning the first sexual intercourse between a Jew and a \"yefat toar\" (see Devarim 21 : 11-14).</p>\n\n<p>In this regard Rambam states, in Mishneh Torah-Melachim uMilchamot 8:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This license is permitted whether the woman is a virgin or not, <strong>even\n  if she is married, for the gentiles' marriages are not recognized.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reference to the lawfulness of this intercourse even if the Gentile woman is married, \"for the gentiles' marriages are not recognized\", has left me rather perplexed, as we read in Devarim 22:22:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“If a man is found lying with a <strong>married woman</strong>, even both of them shall\n  die the man lying with the woman and the woman. So shall you clear\n  away the evil from Israel.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this passage we read \"married woman\", not \"married Jewish woman\".</p>\n\n<p>I therefore ask myself: but if Rambam's statement is correct, without prejudice to the general prohibition of sex between Jews and Gentiles, does a sexual intercourse between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman married to a Gentile man not constitute adultery according to Halakhah? And if it is not adultery, how can this exegesis be reconciled with Devarim 22:22, which precisely speaks of \"married woman\" and not of \"married Jewish woman?\"</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore one is not allowed to use the light of the Hanukkiah for normal secular matters such as reading or in our times taking a picture. However, our practice is to have an extra light (often called a Shamash by Ashkenazim) to be a source of \"secular\" light to prevent issues of using the Hanukkiah as a source of light. This was enacted because it would be difficult not to use the light of the Hanukkiah at all and so we have an extra \"secular\" light that intermingles with the \"holy\" light so that way you cannot tell which is the holy and which is the secular and you are not guilty of using the wrong light for the wrong purpose.</p>\n\n<p>If one is overly concerned about using the holy light then one should add even more \"secular\" lights around so that way less of the \"holy light\" is used.</p>\n\n\n",

Although it is obvious the Torah only obligates people (objects can have no obligations or restrictions), the question is about the exact classification of the obligation: </p>\n\n<p>Is the <em>mitzva</em> a <em>chovas gavra</em> - [which I will define as] an obligation which is not bound to specific circumstances (similar to <em>matzah</em> and <em>tefillin</em>, where a person is obligated to perform a specific action regardless of circumstances), or a <em>choivas bayis</em> [which I defina as] an obligation which is dependant on having a house (similar to <em>tzitzis</em> [where the <em>gavra</em> is only obligated to place them on a garment which is eligible], or <em>ma'akeh</em> [where the <em>gavra</em> is only obligated to build a fence if he has a roof which requires it]).  </p>\n\n<p>It is clear from the Rambam (Berachos 11:3) that it is a <em>chovas gavra</em>. The Rambam writes (11:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>יש מצות עשה שאדם חייב להשתדל ולרדוף עד שיעשה אותה</strong> כגון תפילין וסוכה\n  ולולב ושופר <strong>ואלו הן הנקראין חובה לפי שאדם חייב על כל פנים לעשות</strong> ו<strong>יש\n  מצוה שאינה חובה אלא דומין לרשות</strong> כגון מזוזה ומעקה שאין אדם חייב לשכון\n  בבית החייב מזוזה כדי שיעשה מזוזה אלא אם רצה לשכון כל ימיו באהל או\n  בספינה ישב וכן אינו חייב לבנות בית כדי לעשות מעקה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam distinguishes between two types of Mitzva - one where the person is obligated to perform regardless of circumstance, and there are some where the circumstances cause the obligation. The Rambam continues to apply this distinction to <em>mitzvos d'rabbanan</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן כל המצות שהן מדברי סופרים <strong>בין מצוה שהיא חובה מדבריהם כגון</strong> מקרא\n  מגילה והדלקת נר בשבת <strong>והדלקת נר חנוכה</strong> בין מצות שאינן חובה כגון עירוב\n  ונטילת ידים מברך על הכל קודם לעשייתן אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו לעשות\n  והיכן צונו בתורה שכתוב בה אשר יאמרו לך תעשה נמצא ענין הדברים והצען כך\n  הוא אשר קדשנו במצותיו שציוה בהן לשמוע מאלו שצונו להדליק נר של חנוכה או\n  לקרות את המגילה וכן שאר כל המצות שמדברי סופרים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is clear from the Rambam that he places <em>ner chanuka</em> in the first category.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not to say that the obligation is not intrinsically linked with a house. Although the <em>chiyuv</em> is not dependent on circumstance, the <em>kiyum</em> is. Just like <em>tefillin</em> is a <em>chovas gavra</em> which requires the use of a <em>cheftza</em> - the tefillin - to fulfill the obligation, so does <em>ner chanukah</em> require a house. Every Jew is obligated to light a Menorah in his house on Chanuka.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Defining <em><strong>chovas gavra</strong></em> as an obligation on the person to light a candle (potentially only at the person's own doorway - similar to tefilin requiring the person's own arm), and <em><strong>chovas object/cheftza</strong></em> as an obligation on the person to ensure that his doorway has a candle lit, along the lines of <em>mezuza</em> and <em>ma'akeh</em>.</p>\n<p>It is clear from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.23a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 23a</a> that it is an obligation on the person (or possibly the household group) but certainly not a classic chovas cheftza on the \"house\" itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב ששת אכסנאי חייב בנר חנוכה אמר רבי זירא מריש כי הוינא בי רב משתתפנא בפריטי</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rav Sheshet said: A guest is obligated in lighting the Hanukkah light in the place where he is being hosted. The Gemara relates that\nRabbi Zeira said: At first, when I was studying in the yeshiva, I\nwould participate with perutot, copper coins, together with the host\n[ushpiza], so that I would be a partner in the light that he\nkindled.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The obligation of a guest to light, or at the very least financially participate in the host's lighting, can only be understood if the obligation is on the person to light (and as he is only a guest is not included in the exemption of <em>ner ish ubeiso</em>).</p>\n<p>If it is a matter of the house needing a candle lit (<em>chovas cheftza</em>), this cannot obligate the guest, as the host has already lit his own candle in the doorway, and the guest can rely on that just as he relies on his host's <em>mezuza</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

A male is born face down whereas a female is born face up. Another source describes 2 channels in the male sex organ; one for urine and one for semen? How did these beliefs arise and how could people have believed things like this if they are demonstrably false?  There are also various tereifos that were fatal, but no longer. Was it really the case that no one bothered to check?Alternatively, has nature changed? I believe these ideas are myths which is why I've posted them here.\nRambam speaks about astronomy.  In those days they couldn't prove things one way or another.  The examples above would have been testable in those days as they are today.  Is it possible to test if the Talmud's description of human anatomy was correct eg finding a skeleton over 1800 years old.  Another example is the idea that people have 248 bones and 365 tendons or muscles.  Nowadays we know an adult has 206 bones.  Perhaps they looked at a child's body or perhaps they followed an accepted tradition which had never been checked.  In summary:  Can the scientific beliefs in the Talmud be tested?  If reality was the same as today, why did no one point out the errors?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>When examining Maimonides' medical writings and comparing them to the medical advice of the Talmud, one is often left in shock. Many, if not all of the ideas contained in the Talmud are erroneous when in comparison to the findings of modern science. How can such pious talmudic rabbis err? Is it possible that such holy men could make mistakes? Maimonides explained that the ancient rabbis were not experts in science and often had to work with the science of their day, and since the science was frequently wrong, it is no surprise that they were also in error.[1]</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the ancient rabbis had limitations and did not always understand science fully. As a result, they are frequently wrong because they relied on the primitive science of their age. But since science progresses, it is no surprise that Maimonides even admits that future generations will understand science better than he does.[2]</p>\n\n<p>Did people’s nature change? No. Natural law is fixed and needs no change.

Chazal say that a seven month baby can live, and an eight month baby cannot, unless the eight month baby is really a seven month baby who was born late. This is true; there are seven month babies who are perfectly healthy (one was born to a friend of mine), and an eight month pre-term baby cannot survive without medical intervention. Is a baby born at eight months more likely to be pre-term? Halacha seems to say yes. Compared to a seven month baby? Is that an easy comparison to make?</p>\n\n<p>Skipping to the case of trefos, Chazal give us a list of trefos, and there is a dispute if an animal with such an injury will necessarily die. We see that, for some of these injuries, the animals live. That could mean that the reality is like the one side of the dispute, or it could mean that these injuries are not always fatal, and just that such an injury could cause death. The other side of the dispute could hold that some trefa injuries are not fatal at all. Or it could mean that we don't know the proper definition of those injuries that Chazal listed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>With regard to things discussed in the Gemorah, they were frequently very easily observable and determinable even in ancient times.

That Gemorah also explicitly says they dissected corpses and came back to ask their Rebbe that they didn't find 248 bones) </p>\n\n<p>Even without the Gemorah, based on non-Jewish medical history books I see no question that things have changed since ancient times. It's simply inconceivable that in ancient times they practiced all those wacky medical techniques (not mentioned in the Gemorah)if they helped no one. They had to have helped back then. If they were really so ineffective people would have noticed. They never could have caught on and been practiced to such a large extent if people didn't see any improvement that they could clearly attribute to having those medical techniques done. </p>\n\n\n",

This is because the length of all months except for Cheshvan and Kislev are fixed. When we see that the following Rosh Hashanah will fall out on an invalid day of the week (Sunday, Wednesday or Friday), we add a day to the calendar (at the end of the previous Cheshvan, ten or eleven months earlier, to give people the maximum amount of time to find out). The next year will sometimes have a day taken away from Kislev, depending on the moon's exact time of appearance.</p>\n\n<p>The day of the week that any date, say Rosh Chodesh Nisan, would fall out on if not for this postponement is essentially equal. (I'm sure someone who wants to do the statistics will say some are more common that others. But approximately.) But after the postponement, three days of the week are each twice as common as the fourth valid day of the week.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, let us work out first what will be for the earlier parshas shekalim and hachosesh and the following Chanukah for each of the days of the week that RC Nisan can fall on, which are Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Sunday: the parshas shekalim leading up to this year is on Rosh Chodesh, but not hachodesh. Rosh Hashanah will be on a Tuesday, so the next year will always be kisidrin, meaning that Cheshvan will have 29 days and Kislev 30, so RC Teves will be on Shabbos and Sunday. So this year has twice a three torah Shabbos and one two Torah weekday. Notice that the two are not the same calendar year.</p>\n\n<p>Tuesday: neither the previous parshas shekalim nor hachosesh were on RC, and the following Rosh Hashanah will be on Thursday, so RC Teves will be during the week, either one day or two.

    "content": "# When making bank deposits, does one have to filter out foreign coins if the bank itself doesn't?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Where I live, one can go to any bank and buy rolls (or cases!) of pennies, and one can also redeem such rolls.  Merchants do both of these often.</p>\n\n<p>I have noticed that rolls of pennies occasionally contain foreign currency of similar size and appearance.  I'm in the US and we see Canadian pennies sometimes; presumably they're mixed into the general money supply and often people don't notice them.  I don't know what procedures banks use to check/validate the rolls of coins they distribute, but I assume it doesn't involve anybody inspecting individual coins and is probably based on weight and length.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: if you have a large number of pennies that you want to deposit, does <em>halacha</em> require that you inspect them all first and weed out any foreign ones, or does the fact that the banks don't seem to do this either mean that that's just a risk we all take?  Does the answer depend on likelihood, for example one who just took a trip to Canada and has a pocketfull of change has to check but in general people don't?</p>\n\n<p>This question was prompted by a project in my synagogue's school to collect 304,805 pennies as part of writing a new <em>sefer torah</em>.  I'm asking out of curiosity, not as a decision-maker for those deposits.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't think it's a full answer, but here is a source that IMHO should be considered:</p>\n\n<p>משנה בבא בתרא פרק ו משנה ב</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המוכר פירות לחבירו הרי זה מקבל עליו רובע טנופת לסאה תאנים מקבל עליו\n  עשר מתולעות למאה מרתף של יין מקבל עליו עשר קוססות למאה הקנקנים בשרון\n  מקבל עליו עשר פיטסות למאה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishna Baba-batra 6:2</p>\n\n<p>One who sales fruits to another, [The buyer] accepts <em>rova</em> filth (rotten fruit) for each <em>Sea'a</em>, for figs - [the buyer] accepts ten wormed figs for every hundred figs. [For] A basement of wine [the buyer] accepts ten poor quality jugs for every hundred jugs. In the Sharon area, [The buyer] accepts ten unprepared jugs for every hundred jugs.</p>\n\n<p>So, if the bank \"buys\" those coins from you, it could be that it accepts a reasonable amount of wrong currency, if it's a big amount of coins, because \"that's the way of the traders\" - not to be peaky about it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I understand that there is difference between coins an fruits - coins do not rot, but not always a difference in the reality will cause a difference of ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I offer this incomplete answer as a contribution to developing a better answer. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088866/jewish/Genevah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Genevah, 1 (2)</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah prohibits stealing even the slightest amount.

How careful one has to be must depend on the size of the risk. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we may find a way out by looking at the halachic approach to bankruptcy. <a href=\"https://www.jlaw.com/Articles/bank.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchok A.

Other opinions say that even though halakhah does not\n  recognize a bankruptcy discharge in a pure halakhic system, under the\n  system that we live in one is permitted to utilize it.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is yet another theory that would allow the same thing, and that\n  is what I would call the \"rules of the game\" theory.

But in a <strong>machlokes about factual reality, such as when two amoraim are debating what an earlier amora had said, one position is actually false.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.6b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gittin 6b</a> brings a machlokes about the actual historical facts of the story of Pilegesh of Giva, but yet it still says eilu veilu! This seems to conflict with the above Rashi. </p>\n\n<p>[The Gemara continues by explaining that both versions are not mutually exclusive, but then perhaps this can always be done, and so we're still left with a question on why Rashi says only one position about historical facts can be true].</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think we can reconcile the passage in Gittin with the quote from Rashi as follows:</p>\n<p>It seems that the key point from Rashi is whether the dispute is a matter of logical application or a historical fact. When one person said something, as in Rashi's case, there are no two possibilities that can be correct for what was said. Therefore, if there are multiple versions of what was said in a particular statement, to the exclusion of anything else, one version must of necessity be false.</p>\n<p>In the case in Gittin truly parallel to this? The two parties there are not debating what someone said at a particular time. While it may seem that they are debating the historical factual reality of a particular event, I would argue that that may not be the case either. Consider the fact that neither R. Evyatar nor R. Yonatan were present at the event under discussion; nor do either of them assert any kind of tradition that the event happened in the particular way they are advocating. What reason, therefore would they have to stake out positions on something that happened long in the past, with no available eyewitnesses?</p>\n<p>It would seem reasonable that rather than debating the factual reality they were debating the explanation of the Scriptural verse. The verse in question states  וַתִּזְנֶה עָלָיו פִּילַגְשׁוֹ and the debate centers around what this phrase conveys. As Tosafot on the spot points out, one of the disputants interpreted וַתִּזְנֶה as relating to the same root as זנות, which would indicate some form of sexual impropriety, while his opponent interpreted it as relating to the root מזון, which would indicate something to do with food.</p>\n<p>Thus, when R. Evyatar said that the husband found a fly in his food, he is actually saying that the verse indicates that he found a fly in his food, since it tells us that there was something involving מזון. And when R. Yonatan says that he found a hair in her genital area he is actually saying that the verse indicates that he found a hair in her genital area since it tells is that there was something relating to זנות.</p>\n<p>The fact that these two conclusions seem to be at odds with each other does not mean that the factual conclusions were what was being debated. Indeed, this is precisely why the Talmud is able to say that both are true. Because they were merely discussing the implications of the verse, the Talmud is able to say that the verse in fact implied both of those things, and then elaborate on what the value of each of those things was in terms of the causation of the ensuing incident.</p>\n<p>When read this way, we can actually resolve an additional difficulty. If this was merely a dispute about what event was the proximate cause of the incident of \"pilegesh b'givah\", how can the Talmud say that both opinions are correct when it then immediately explains that one opinion was not really correct (as it says that both events occurred but only one of them was actually the cause)? That does not seem to be sensible. However, once we view the dispute as being about Scriptural interpretation, the Talmud's explanation fits very nicely. Elijah says that both opinions are the words of God – this is true because the verse indeed does convey both meanings (and presumably deliberately so). When the Talmud then clarifies which one of the two events was the actual cause of the incident it is not casting inaccuracy on either of the two opinions; it is simply explaining that though the verse conveys that two different events happened, one of the events was actually forgivable while the other one led to the incident of \"pilegesh b'givah\". Seen this way, neither disputant was incorrect. They both provided correct interpretations of the verse, and both interpretations indeed corresponded to reality. The question of which of the two events actually caused the incident is a \"fun fact\", but it was not the primary discussion. Indeed, the Talmud does not offer any explanation as to how both events could have been the proximate cause – and there is no need for it to do so, as the \"eilu v'eilu\" is already accounted for with the Scriptural interpretations.</p>\n<p>This fits back with Rashi in Ketubot as Rashi there says that when two people are discussing an interpretation, or applying one idea to another, or comparing cases, there is no necessity for one opinion to be objectively false. That is exactly what happened in Gittin.</p>\n\n\n",

It is known that Samson was a Nazirite; does it not stand to reason that his strength is bestowed by God due to his consecrated status as a Nazirite? </p>\n\n<p>His hair is cut, which would end his Naziriteship and his strength, or is that just a coincidence?</p>\n\n<p>Is the power in the hair? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is not that the power is in the hair itself, however, he was granted the power as long as he kept the vow of the nezirus. Letting his hair be cut, caused him to break the vow. It was breaking the vow that caused him to lose his power.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15821/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shoftim 13:5</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because you shall conceive, and bear a son; and a razor shall not come\n  upon his head, for a Nazirite to God shall the lad be from the womb;\n  and he will begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> explains that growing his hair physically contributed to his strength, but God also granted him additional strength on account of him being a nazirite. He proves this from the fact that when Samson cut his hair he lost his strength immediately – had the strength been solely from growing his hair it would have dissipated over time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועם שבזה הענין מבוא לענין הגבורה רצוני לומר גידול השער אלא שראוי שלא יעלם ממנו שהי\"ת חידש בו גבורה נוספת מפני הנזירות אשר לא יחייבה גדול השער לפי הטבע וזה שכבר מצאנו שתכף שגולח סר כחו ממנו ולא היה זה כן אם היתה הגבורה מתחייבת מגידול השער כי הרושם שיש בגידול השער בגבורה הוא מצד עוצרו האדים העשנים בגוף שהיה מדרכם שיתהוה מהם השער וזה כי השער בהגיעו אל תכליתו לא יגדל ואז יעצרו האדים העשנים ההם תוך הגוף ותיגבר האדומה בגוף ויתחדש מזה רוח גבורה ומי שזה דרכו לא תסור הגבורה בגילוח השער כי אם אחר זמן רב ומעט מעט</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Bible reports when the Philistine woman Delilah sheared Samson’s hair, his source of strength, while Samson was asleep. </p>\n\n<p>Actually, Samson’s strength was determined by his observance of the mandates placed by angels, this includes the prohibition of cutting hair.</p>\n\n<p>However, Samson knew Delilah would cut his hair since she attempted to dilute his powers before. He must have known she would try again, namely cutting his hair, which he revealed as a method to subside his strength. Thus Samson had no quarrels revealing the “secret” of his strength, his hair. This was deception, a trick, and it worked. However, Samson failed to recognize that his powers came from G-d, which could be removed if he acted improperly.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Samson’s strength was not depleted due to baldness. For when Samson prayed his strength was restored. It follows that cutting the hair should not be taken literally.</p>\n\n\n",

Eue or Euan in Greek could either be a simple mis-transliteration, or perhaps the Eu- prefix could hint at the Greek meaning \"good.\" The Vulgate uses \"Hava\".

If we follow Abbaye's opinion that Yannay is Yochanan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.29a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 29a</a>), then the story of how he became a Sadducee is given in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.66a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 66a</a>. Rava's opinion is that they are two separate people, but the story is still useful because it explains the motives why someone might convert from being a Pharisee to being a Sadducee. Here are the relevant parts of the story (translation modified from Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה שם זקן אחד ויהודה בן גדידיה שמו ויאמר יהודה בן גדידיה לינאי המלך ינאי המלך רב לך כתר מלכות הנח כתר כהונה לזרעו של אהרן שהיו אומרים אמו נשבית במודיעים ויבוקש הדבר ולא נמצא ויבדלו חכמי ישראל בזעם ויאמר אלעזר בן פועירה לינאי המלך ינאי המלך הדיוט שבישראל כך הוא דינו ואתה מלך וכהן גדול כך הוא דינך ומה אעשה אם אתה שומע לעצתי רומסם ותורה מה תהא עליה הרי כרוכה ומונחת בקרן זוית כל הרוצה ללמוד יבוא וילמוד</p>\n<p>Now there was a certain elder present called Yehuda ben Gedidya, and Yehuda ben Gedidya said to King Yannai: King Yannai, the crown of the monarchy suffices for you. Leave the crown of the priesthood for the descendants of Aaron. As they would say that Yannai’s mother was taken captive in Modi’in. And the matter was investigated and was not discovered. And the Sages of Israel were expelled in the king’s rage.</p>\n<p>And Elazar ben Po’ira said to King Yannai: King Yannai, such is the judgment of a common person in Israel. But you are a king and a High Priest. Is this your judgment as well? Yannai replied: And what should I do? Elazar responded: If you listen to my advice, crush them. Yannai countered: But what will become of the Torah? He retorted: Behold, it is wrapped and placed in the corner. Anyone who wishes to study can come and study. We have no need for the Sages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words: a Pharisee insulted him by claiming that he wasn't a proper priest because his mother was raped, which led him to suspect the Pharisees of intending to rebel against him, and so he expelled the sages. Afterwards, El'azar ben Po'ira advised him that anyone who wishes can come and study the Torah. As Rav Nachman bar Yitschak adds here, his statement that whoever wants to learn the Torah can do so without the sages was a repudiation of the Oral Torah, meaning that he believed that the Written Torah was all that was necessary.</p>\n<p>If we follow Abbaye in identifying Yannay with Yochanan, these would be the reasons that led him to become a Sadducee. If we follow Rava, then this isn't directly about the same person, but the motives (disputes with the Pharisees and the belief that the Torah could be learned without the traditions of the sages) could have been similar in his case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=52861#p=157\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vort</a> from R' Moshe of Kobrin is that after 80 years נעשה צדוקי - he felt himself to be a tzaddik.

A further reason why this narrative of Judah and Tamar is interpolated here is to place in juxtaposition the story of Potiphar’s wife and the story of Tamar, suggesting that just as this woman (Tamar) acted out of pure motives so also the other (Potiphar’s wife) acted out of pure motives, for she foresaw by her astrological speculations that she was destined to be the ancestress of children by him (Joseph) — but she did not know whether these children were to be hers or her daughter’s (Genesis Rabbah 85:2).<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.39.1-2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.39.1-2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This comes from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.85.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabbah 85:2</a>, quoted by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Genesis.39.1.1?lang=Bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bereishit 39:1</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm basically asking if something like that exists in gemara or rishonim. \n(I know it may seem a bit picky, but I'm looking for a source which explicitly says that secular studies are equally important as other mitzvot)\nThank you!!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Genesis 1:26 states, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Let us make man in our demut.\" Verse 1:27 relates that “G-d made man\n  in His tzelem, in the tzelem of G-d, He made him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, people are made in the image of G-d, in the tzelem. It cannot mean “likeness\" since G-d has no body and is one. Onkelos renders 2:7's “a living being,” to ruach m’mal’la, “one with the power of speech,” a characteristic of man's intelligence. Maimonides also felt that this denotes intelligence, interpreting the \"Garden of Eden\" story to be a parable about using one's intelligence.

    "content": "# Why include an impossible yavam in yibum?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>R. Akiva states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Yevamot.8.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Y'vamos</em> 8:4</a>) that there is a distinction between the levirate obligations of an impotent man who has been that way all his life and an impotent man who became that way during his lifetime. Namely, the latter has a levirate status (which he is required to sever, but that's beside the point) because there was a time that he could father children and the former doesn't because he was never in a physical state conducive to fulfillment of <em>yibum</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Rava explains (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.79b.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">79b</a>) that it need not be that the man is physically qualified right now, just that he was ever qualified. This is based on the fact that the same qualifications apply to both the deceased, who triggers the obligation, and the surviving brother, who fulfills it.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> And every deceased person had some period of time immediately before death in which they were physically unqualified to conceive children, due to the circumstances that near-death entails. Disqualifying such people would mean ineffectuating the <em>mitzva</em> of <em>yibum</em>, so it can't be what the <em>Tora</em> had in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Why does R. Akiva's opinion allow a <em>s'ris adam</em> on the grounds of having had a <em>sh'as kosher</em> at an irrelevant time in the past before he was married? It could have allowed only those <em>sarisim</em> who had a <em>sh'as kosher</em> at a relevant time, thus excluding a <em>yavam</em> who had no <em>sh'as kosher</em> while his <em>zika</em> was active.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the lecture of Mishna we still don't know the type of Saris, but we see an equivalence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא חולץ  <=> ולא חולצין לאשתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if someone became Saris and die without children, <code>לא חולצין לאשתו.</code></p>\n<p>The reason for the <code>לא חולצין לאשתו</code> is the Derasha <code>לא ימחה, פרט למי ששמו מחוי </code> Gemara 24a.</p>\n<p>If the brother of the died husband is Saris, he have not to make Chalitsa.</p>\n<p>The reason for the <code>לא חולץ</code> is the Derasha <code>להקים לאחיו ולאו בר הכי הוא</code> Gemara 79b.</p>\n<p>However, it turns out that every man, a few time before his death becomes Saris Adam. So if the type of Saris for whom <code>לא חולץ ולא חולצין לאשתו</code> is Saris Adam, there is no more issue for Mitsvat Ybum and Chalitsa.</p>\n<p>In this reasoning, there is a problem. If the Saris who doesn't make Chalitsa and his brother doesn't make Chalitsa to his wife, we have a false inference. Because we know from the fact that Mitsvat Ybum and Chalitsa exist, that every husbands  is Saris Adam before the Mitsva, and despite that, his brothers have to make Chalitsa or Ybum. So, to solve this problem, we rule that equivalently to the rule for the dead husband, a Yabam Saris Adam have to make Chalitsa.</p>\n<p>If you ask for the logic. The same logic as for the husband. Why need we to be worry for a man who became Saris and died without children. Because he had a Shaat Hacosher. since we have Shemo Machuy that is neglected because Sheat Hacosher, Lav bar Hakamat shem is neglected because of Sheat Hacosher.</p>\n<p>The question of the OP seems to underline the Svarat Hacholkim. First, the Husband was a normal man, ha was not Saris, before the death process he was fertile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כחישותא הוא דאתחילה ביה - רש\"י ולאו סריס הוא אלא מיתה מכחשת כחו</p>\n<p>It is only a general state of debility that had set in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, Ein Shemo Machuy. And this Derasha is not a problem for a common dead husband.</p>\n<p>Equivalently, we don't need to change the pashtut of the Derasha of  Derasha <code>להקים  שם לאחיו</code> to establish a name for his brother, that needs a possible fertility.</p>\n<p>So, the Yabam have to be fertile. Or will possibly become fertile.</p>\n<p>In summary, you say that the svara of Rabbi Eliezer is more understandable. The learning of Rabbi Akiva is more formal. But logically, the strength of the Derasha of Rabbi Akiva is that we cannot easily skip the pashtut of <code>פרט למי ששמו מחוי </code>.</p>\n\n\n",

In others words, a dissection of the method, how it works and how it should be applied.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I once came across an obscure pamphlet on how to learn Gemara, with an approbation from R' Yaakov Kaminetsky z\"l. He writes that while it is best to learn how to learn from experience, the pamphlet could be useful for those who did not have time, etc. He clearly indicated that the best way to learn is through actual learning. I believe the same would apply to methods of iyun. They are best acquired by studying under a Rabbi who has mastered his method and learning with him, and no book could accurately convey the method.\nIn addition, such a book would probably be misleading, because it would by necessity focus on the differences and not the commonalities, although the differences are relatively small.</p>\n\n\n",

(Exodus 20:12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Honoring one’s parents is next to honoring G-d. Bechor Schor is saying that G-d is saying that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“if you show honor to your parents who benefited you in many ways, I will know that you also honor Me for the benefits that I gave you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a reward, long life is promised for the observance of this commandment. Bechor Schor explains that this is perfectly reasonable, since the reward is more of a result than a reward  – as those who honor their parents will thereby teach their children to honor them, and in doing so their children will care for them, prolong their lives.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The pashut answer is because if you do it properly it's very time consuming. If you saw the stories how our sages did cibud av you would understand. However this wouldn't explain why the same reward is given for shiluach hakan.\nYou should also note that the gemara in kiddushin 39b concludes there is no reward for mitzvos in this world and the long life of cibud av is reffering to the world to come. However the question would still remain why this mitzva has this special reward.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The purpose of this mitzvah is to bolster faith in tradition by honoring its bearers. That is why it is listed on the first Tablet along with the commandments between man and God. So that your days may be lengthened. This is in recompense for his good deed towards his forebears. Alternatively, it is to enable his own children to honor him, measure for measure; therefore when this commandment is repeated in Devarim (5:16) the Torah adds, “in order that it will be good for you” (Abarbanel).</p>\n\n\n",

If so, where exactly in the introduction to the Guide does Maimonides say that he will purposely contradict himself? I'm looking for the source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In the Introductory Remarks to <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> Maimonides lists seven types of contradictions. The fifth and seventh ones are the what you allude to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seventh cause: It is sometimes necessary to introduce such metaphysical matter as may partly be disclosed, but must partly be concealed: while, therefore, on one occasion the object which the author has in view may demand that the metaphysical problem be treated as solved in one way, it may be convenient on another occasion to treat it as solved in the opposite way. The author must endeavour, by concealing the fact as much as possible, to prevent the uneducated reader from perceiving the contradiction.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp010.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fifth cause is traceable to the use of a certain method adopted in teaching and expounding profound problems. Namely, a difficult and obscure theorem must sometimes be mentioned and assumed as known, for the illustration of some elementary and intelligible subject which must be taught beforehand the commencement being always made with the easier thing. The teacher must therefore facilitate, in any manner which he can devise, the explanation of those theorems, which have to be assumed as known, and he must content himself with giving a general though somewhat inaccurate notion on the subject. It is, for the present, explained according to the capacity of the students, that they may comprehend it as far as they are required to understand the subject. Later on, the same subject is thoroughly treated and fully developed in its right place.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp010.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shortly thereafter he states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Any inconsistency discovered in the present work will be found to arise in consequence of the fifth cause or the seventh. Notice this, consider its truth, and remember it well, lest you misunderstand some of the chapters in this book.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp010.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the fifth and seventh forms involve deliberately being inaccurate in certain instances, and Maimonides confirms that all contradictions in his book are of those forms.</p>\n\n\n",

Techallem is to make shame. An example of this radical is in Bamidbar 12.14. but it's probably not right because of the comment of @ba.</p>\n<p>But now I just have read the Abudarham about this Beracha, which was lacking in previous editions, probably because of census. In the new editions, based on a manuscript. He says that Kaleh, this is his Girsa, without Mem, is exterminate. He said that the end is Teshaber Vesachnia because it's similar to the Chatima, shover Oyvim Umachnia Zedim, and the part before the Chatima needs to be similar to the Chatima.</p>\n<p>After learning the Maharal on the Agadot of Pereq Cheleq 95b, I thought of a new explanation.  He explains why Sancheriv survived the massacre of his army.  It was to be able to humiliate him and not simply eliminate him.  Thus could be realized the demonstration of the falsity of his step.  I roughly sum it up in one sentence.  This alters the accuracy of my statement.  But that is enough to give an explanation for the formulation of the Beracha.  Not only do we ask God to annihilate heretics, but we ask that he also cause them to be ridiculed.  To make fun of them is a refinement in the way of making them disappear. The order is crescent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>They are ordered according to the process of their correction or tikkun. Looking at the complete blessing will help to understand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלַמַּלְשִׁינִים אַל תְּהִי תִקְוָה וְכָל הָרִשְׁעָה כְּרֶגַע תֺּאבֵד וְכָל־אֹיְ֒בֶֽיךָ מְהֵרָה יִכָּרֵֽתוּ, וְהַזֵּדִים מְהֵרָה תְעַקֵּר וּתְשַׁבֵּר וּתְמַגֵּר וּתְכַלֵם וְתַשְׁפִּילֵם וְתַכְנִיעֵם בִּמְהֵרָה בְיָמֵֽינוּ: בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְהֹוָה שׁוֹבֵר אֹיְ֒בִים וּמַכְנִֽיעַ זֵדִים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The opening words are addressing those Jews who inform on their fellow Jews to the authorities of an oppressive, non-Jewish government. This type of government and those who make it up (וְכָל־אֹיְ֒בֶֽיךָ) we pray to become extinct, meaning that they and their potential future descendants end. They are <strong>enemies of G-d and His Kingdom</strong>.</p>\n<p>We then address the next category of individuals who are called <em>Rebels</em> (הַזֵּדִים). Rebels can come from two general sources. Those who truly reject and oppose G-d, like for example Nimrod and his followers, and those who for a variety of reasons have been seduced. Those in the second category may be salvageable. There may be a possibility of rehabilitation for them.</p>\n<p>And this illustrates the order of their tikkun.</p>\n<p>The first group are connected politically and economically, powerful and exert their domination throughout society. For them we say the words:</p>\n<p>תְעַקֵּר וּתְשַׁבֵּר וּתְמַגֵּר וּתְכַלֵם</p>\n<p>Which mean: <em>to uproot</em> from power (they remain intact but separated from the source  of their power), <em>to shatter</em> like one would split a log into kindling in order to ignite and burn it up (they are no longer intact), <em>to overthrow</em> or <em>to diminish</em> which means reducing their influence and their connection to the levers of power and finally <em>to extinguish</em> them and their influence entirely.</p>\n<p>The remaining two terms in the blessing are:</p>\n<p>תַשְׁפִּילֵם וְתַכְנִיעֵם</p>\n<p>They relate to those who have been seduced and may be salvageable and rehabilitated. Their seduction was possible because of character defects and their rehabilitation comes after first being removed from power. Only then can they potentially be rehabilitated by <em>being humbled</em>. The source of their seduction originates from pride. The final term is <em>to subdue</em> and again refers to the possible source of their seduction, overindulgence of their desires.</p>\n\n\n",

This led me to wonder if he changed his mind on certain topics that might be reflected by an apparent contradiction between the Mishneh Torah and the Moreh Nevuchim, hence my question. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are certainly things that appear to be contradictions. One popular example is in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=635\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Tefilah 9:7</a> where he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי שאמר בתחנונים מי שריחם על קן ציפור שלא ליקח האם על הבנים או שלא לשחוט אותו ואת בנו ביום אחד ירחם עלינו וכיוצא בענין זה משתקין אותו מפני שמצות אלו גזרת הכתוב הן ואינן רחמים שאילו היו מפני רחמים לא היה מתיר לנו שחיטה כל עיקר</p>\n<p>One who says in his supplicatory prayers: \"May He who showed mercy on a bird's nest prohibiting the taking of the mother together with the chicks, or the slaughter of an animal and its calf on the same day, also show mercy on us,\" or [makes other] similar statements should be silenced, because these mitzvot are God's decrees and not [expressions] of mercy. Were they [expressions] of mercy, He would not permit us to slaughter at all.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920172/jewish/Tefilah-and-Birkat-Kohanim-Chapter-Nine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in Moreh Nevuchim 3:48 he seems to say the opposite:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The same reason applies to the law which enjoins that we should let the mother fly away when we take the young. The eggs over which the bird sits, and the young that are in need of their mother, are generally unfit for food, and when the mother is sent away she does not see the taking of her young ones, and does not feel any pain. In most cases, however, this commandment will cause man to leave the whole nest untouched, because [the young or the eggs], which he is allowed to take, are, as a rule, unfit for food. If the Law provides that such grief should not be caused to cattle or birds, how much more careful must we be that we should not cause grief to our fellowmen. When in the Talmud (Ber. p. 33b) those are blamed who use in their prayer the phrase, \"Thy mercy extendeth to young birds,\" it is the expression of the one of the two opinions mentioned by us, namely, that the precepts of the Law have no other reason but the Divine will. We follow the other opinion.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I happen to think the contradiction is more elaborate than this, but this is how it is commonly cited.)</p>\n<p>Many resolutions have been suggested over the centuries (though most, if not all, don't seem entirely satisfactory), and some have indeed suggested that Rambam simply changed his mind. For instance, in <em>Torah, Chazal, and Science</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Meiselman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Meiselman</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An example of this is the apparent reversal in <em>Moreh Nevuchim</em> of his own ruling in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> regarding one who says that the mitzvah of <em>shiluach haken</em> – sending away the mother bird before taking the chicks – is an example of God's mercy.</p>\n<p>(p. 621)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another example is that in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=7669\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Beit Habechirah 1:13</a> he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המזבח אין עושין אותו אלא בנין אבנים (גזית) וזה שנאמר בתורה מזבח אדמה תעשה לי שיהיה מחובר באדמה שלא יבנוהו לא על גבי כיפין ולא על גבי מחילות וזה שנאמר ואם מזבח אבנים מפי השמועה למדו שאינו רשות אלא חובה</p>\n<p>The Altar should only be made as a structure of stone. Though the Torah states, [Exodus 20:24]: \"You shall make Me an altar of earth,\" [that verse is interpreted to mean that] the altar must be in contact with the earth and not built on an arch or on a cave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet in Moreh Nevuchim 3:45 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The commandment that the stones of the altar shall not be hewn and that no iron tool shall be lifted up upon them (Deut. xxvii. 5), has been explained by our Sages as follows: It is not right that the tool that shortens man's life should be lifted up upon that which gives length of life. As an Agadic explanation this is good: but the real reason is this: the heathen used to build their altars with hewn stones: we ought not to imitate them. For this reason we have to make an altar of earth: \"Thou shalt make unto me an altar of earth\" (Exod. xx. 24); if it should be impossible to dispense altogether with stones, they must not be hewn, but employed in their natural state. Thus the Law also prohibits from worshipping over painted stones (Lev. xxvi. 1), or from planting any tree near the altar of the Lord (Deut. xvi. 21).</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp181.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p><strong>Mishneh Torah</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, is known by many as the second Torah and Talmud, for he writes in the introduction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“a person will not need another text at all with regard to any Jewish law.” Instead, “a person should first study the Written Law [the Torah], and then study this text and will then understand the entire Oral Law [the rabbinical enactments] from it without having to study any other text other than these two.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Contrary to what many people think, Mishneh Torah does contain philosophy. In the Mishneh Torah “Code of Jewish Laws,” Laws of Kings 11:3, chapters 11 and 12, Maimonides explains that the Messianic age will be a natural event.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Guide of the Perplexed</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed is his philosophic works. Yet the work is contradictory. This was because he was writing for two audiences. For example, in the Mishneh Torah he expressed his belief in angels but in the Guide (2:6,) he equates them to the natural forces. G-d is all-powerful and needs no helpers. More examples are the sacrifices, which the Rambam writes were a concession for humans (see Guide 3:32).</p>\n\n<p>In the introduction to the Guide, Maimonides spells out his technique of implementing the fifth and seventh contradictions, writing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Do not read superficially, lest you do me an injury, and derive no benefit for yourself. You must study thoroughly and read continually; for you will find the solution of those important problems of religion, which are the source of anxiety to all intelligent men.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When did \"Lo B'Shamayim Hi\" Come Into Effect?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The concept of Lo B'Shamyim Hi (It is not in heaven) is a central tenet to the Halakhic process amongst Rabbinic Jews and is summarized nicely by this Wikipedia Article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The phrase \"not in Heaven\" is understood to justify man's authority to\n  interpret the Torah. The Talmud explains \"[The Torah] is not in\n  Heaven\" to mean that the meaning of the Torah itself is to be\n  uncovered not by prophets, or even God's miracles or words, but by\n  man's interpretation and decision-making. In the story of the Oven of\n  Akhnai,[3] \"Rabbi Yehoshua affirmed the independence of man's\n  interpretation from divine intervention since this is what God wills.\n  In support he adduces the biblical statement that the Torah is 'not in\n  heaven' (Deuteronomy 30:12).\"</p>\n  \n  <p>In the academic study of Jewish law, the verse \"not in Heaven\" serves\n  as the Biblical grounding for the jurisprudential structure of\n  halakhah (Jewish law). The source for Rabbinic authority is really\n  from Deuteronomy 17:11 (According to the law which they shall teach\n  you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you\n  shall do). As one author explains, thanks to the midrashic reading of\n  the verse, \"...God himself acquiesced in His exclusion from the\n  halakhic process. Having revealed His will in Sinai in the grundnorm,\n  He Himself, according to the Rabbinic explanation, entrusted the\n  interpretation of His will to the Sages.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven</a></p>\n\n<p>But my question is when did Lo B'Shamayim Hi come into effect? For example there are many laws given in the Torah that don't take effect until the Israelites are in the land of Israel. In the case of Lo B'Shamayim Hi we see Moses not applying this concept in several important instances. In at least 2 instances a situation arises in which Moses is unable to render a decision, the judges/princes/leaders are unable to render a decision, and apparently no attempt to arrive at a decision by majority happens. Instead Moses goes to God to get these halakhic matters resolved like in the case of Zelphehad's daughters.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers 27:1-8</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son\n  of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son\n  of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah,\n  Milkah and Tirzah. They came forward 2 and stood before Moses, Eleazar\n  the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance to the\n  tent of meeting and said, 3 “Our father died in the wilderness. He was\n  not among Korah’s followers, who banded together against the Lord, but\n  he died for his own sin and left no sons. 4 Why should our father’s\n  name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property\n  among our father’s relatives.”</p>\n  \n  <p>5 <strong>So Moses brought their case before the Lord</strong>, 6 and the Lord said to\n  him, 7 “What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must\n  certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father’s\n  relatives and give their father’s inheritance to them.</p>\n  \n  <p>8 “Say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, give his\n  inheritance to his daughter. 9 If he has no daughter, give his\n  inheritance to his brothers. 10 If he has no brothers, give his\n  inheritance to his father’s brothers. 11 If his father had no\n  brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan,\n  that he may possess it. This is to have the force of law for the\n  Israelites, as the Lord commanded Moses.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my question is, when did Lo B'Shamayim Hi come into effect? Was it at the appointing of the judges, and if so, why don't we have instances of it being utilized and instead have only the opposite? Or perhaps it happens after the death of Moshe? But even that seems problematic as clearly the Umim and the Thumim were used to try and divine decisions.</p>\n\n<p>So when was the concept of Lo B'SHamayim Hi supposed to be put into effect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Well we know what month it went into effect.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, this is a side-effect of the dispute over who wrote the last 8 verses of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>There are strong indications that Moshe's role was to transmit the Torah to us. \"<em>Torah tzivah lanu Moshe</em> -- Moshe commanded us the Torah\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 33:4</a>). R Simlai uses this verse to derive the number of 613 <em>mitzvos</em> -- Moshe relayed 611 of them, the <em>gematria</em> of \"Torah\", and 2 heard directly from Hashem at the beginning of the 10 commandments. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.23b.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 23b</a>) So this verse in Devarim is taken to be specifically about Moshe giving us <em>halakhah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Hashem has Malachi enjoin his audience to obey halkhah with the words \"<em>Zikhru Toras Moshe avdi</em> -- Remember the Torah of My servant Moshe\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.3.22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:22</a>)</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a debate in a <em>beraisa</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 15a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.30a.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 30a</a>) about the last 8 verses of Devarim that describe Moshe's passing, burial, and the nation's mourning for him. One opinion was that Moshe couldn't have written them, since at the time it wasn't true yet -- and it was unthinkable that Moshe would write an untruth. The other is that Moshe wrote it \"with tears\".</p>\n\n<p>According to the opinion that Yehoshua wrote those words, then we delay the end of the giving of the Torah to the end of the month described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.34.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 8</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the position that Yehoshua wrote these verses of the Torah, it would seem that one can derive <em>halakhos</em> from a text written after Moshe.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a third position, that the last 8 verses are not themselves Torah. This is suggested by the Meshekh Chokhmah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meshech_Hochma%2C_Ki_Tavo.37-40\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Savo 28:61</a>). These verses are required for a <em>seifer Torah</em> to be kosher, but they are an appendix, not part of the actual text of the Torah. The Meshekh Chokhmah does not believe there could even be a debate about whether Yehoshua wrote actual Torah. So, in his opinion, the last 6 verses were written by Yehoshua, but the giving of the Torah from heaven to earth did end with Moshe.</p>\n\n<p>Which (I may add), nicely fits our citation of R Simlai as well, since there are no mitzvos in these verses.</p>\n\n<p>Also, neither the Bavli nor the Yerushalmi (nor any of the medrashei halakhah the Bar Ilan CD) derive an actual halakhah from these verses. <strong>IF</strong> Yehoshua wrote verses that are considered Torah, we could assume that <em>derashos</em> could still be there, just either not found, or if found, not cited in print.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The gemara Eruvin 13b says that there was a machlokes between Beis Shamai and beis Hillel for 3 years while they tried to determine who the halacha would follow. Eventually a bas kol (heavenly voice) called out and said that while both opinions were \"the words of the living G-d\" the halacha is like beis hillel. אלו ואלו דברי אלקים חיים והלכה כבית הלל.</p>\n\n<p>This is accepted as the normative halacha. </p>\n\n<p>The gemara yevamos 14a, and the tosfos there and in Bava Metzia 59b (the achnai oven) discuss different ways of reconciling this with the gemara of lo bashamayim hi.</p>\n\n<p>But what comes out from it is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>At least during the time of beis shamai and beis hillel, a heavenly voice was used to determine what the halacha will be.</p>\n\n<p>After the story of R' Yehoshua and R' Eliezer and the oven of Achnai, we have he accepted halachic position of Lo BaShamayim hi the halacha is established down on earth, not with heavenly voices.</p>\n\n<p>The change took place during these couple of generations between the students of Hillel and Shamai, and R' Yehoshua and R' Eliezer (this is also the time of R' Gamliel and R' Akiva as is clear from the story there.)</p>\n\n<p>See also Collected Writings of Rav S.R. Hirsch, the Volume on the Oral Lawe (I think it's vol 5, but I can't access it currently.) He discusses these gemaras and these issues and explains it in a bit more detail.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source justifying no Tefillin: 9 Av\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was discussing the Ashkenazi minhagim and hanhagot of Tish'a beAv with a contact of mine, namely the universal Ashkenazi practice to refrain from tallit and tefillin until after chatzot. He told me that some among the Ba'alei Tosafot had sought to entirely eliminate the wearing of these on 9 Av, due to the magnitude of the mourning associated with the day.</p>\n\n<p>My question is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the source in Ashkenazi Rishonic writing for this opinion ?</li>\n<li>What justification could be applied to make this practice not be bittul 'aseh (nullification of a positive commandment) ?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mourners don't wear tefilin the day of most-intense mourning. (Certainly not before the burial, but many say the day-of burial, even after the burial, i.e. the first day of Shiva.)</p>\n<p>The source for <em>that</em> is Ezekiel 24:17. He is told that his wife will die but that he shouldn't do the normal mourning rituals; we learn from here what many of them are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵבֶל לֹא תַעֲשֶׂה פְאֵרְךָ חֲבוֹשׁ עָלֶיךָ וּנְעָלֶיךָ תָּשִׂים בְּרַגְלֶיךָ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't act out mourning; keep your glory wrapped on your head, and shoes on your feet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"glory on your head\" is tefilin.</p>\n<p>So it wasn't the medieval rabbis who made up new idea called \"skip tefilin for a day\"; the concept was already out there for intense mourning. The question then simply came what aspects of mourning (and to what intensity) are adopted on Tisha B'Av, once we see that the Talmud enacted many mourning rituals for that day.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Shulchan Aruk says 555:1 - We are accustomed to not wear tephilin nor talit on the morning of 9 Av.  Source being the Tur.  The Tur brings Maharam that it is forbidden to wear Tefillin on 9 av as the mourning for temple is greater mourning than 1st day of a deceased relative where it is also forbidden to wear tefilin. The Tur holds a relative is more stringent than the temple.\nAccording to Shulchan Aruk & Tur et al they are worn during mincha.  The Mishna Berura 555:3 gives reasons - when the fire burned in the temple it was clear that the punishment would be on bricks and not people.  And also to show that we have some comfort from out mourning on that very day.</li>\n<li>It is not cancelling a commandment since we do the mitzva during mincha. And according to Maharam the laws of morning make it that there is no mitzva to put on tefilin.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Nevertheless, when Isaiah was prophesying he was clearly talking of someone in the future and not Moshe who had been in the past.

Just as the sages do not believe that Isaiah 53 <strong>literally</strong> speaks about Moshe, they also do not believe it <strong>literally</strong> speaks about the Messiah. </p>\n\n<p>The ancient Jewish view that appears continually in the later commentators is that in its plain sense meaning the servant that appears throughout the Book of Isaiah is Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The verse says וַאֲנַ֣חְנוּ חֲשַׁבְנֻ֔הוּ נָג֛וּעַ, \"and we considered him 'afflicted',\" which the Talmud considers to a name of Moshiah.

[Num. 15:37-41]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But we don't wear tzitzit in the evening.  That's because the Torah says, \"<em>Ur'item oto</em> -- And you will see [the tzitzit]\" and thus remember the commandments. The rabbis concluded that this mitzvah is only for the daytime, when you can see clearly.</p>\n\n<p>So why do we recite this section at night also?   Because it's part of the full Shema, which we must recite twice a day.  And why is it part of the full Shema?  The Talmud says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yehudah ben Habiba said: They included the section on fringes [in the Shema] because it makes reference to ... the Exodus from Egypt, the obligation of the commandments, and [a warning against] being led astray. \n  [Ber. 12b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why didn't the rabbis write a substitute passage that mentions these things, but does not mention tzitzit, since they are out of place in the evening service?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is not for Tsitsit but , but it is a part of the Shema, the set of the 3 paragraphs. I</p>\n\n<p>See Berachot 21a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rab Judah said: If a man is in doubt whether he has recited the Shema', he need not recite it again.  If he I in doubt whether he has said 'true and firm', or not, he should say it again.  What is the reason? - the recital of the Shema' is ordained only by the rabbis, the saying of 'true and firm' is a scriptural ordinance.  R' Joseph raised an objection to this, 'and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up'.  - said Abaye to him: that was written with reference to words of torah.  We have learnt: A ba'al keri says mentally, and says no blessing either before or after at meals he says the grace after but not the grace before.  Now if you assume that 'true and firm' is a scriptural regulation, let him say the blessing after the Shema'? - Why should he say [the blessing after]?  <strong>If it is in order to mention the going forth from Egypt</strong> , that is already mentioned in the Shema' {<code>this is in the third paragraph</code>}! But then let him say the former {<code>the Shita Mekubetset says that they tell about Emet Veyatsiv, and note that the Baal Keri says mentally KS, despite that it's Derabanan (following the line of Shmuel). And even if the hazkarat yetsiat Mitsrayim is Deorayita, the Gemara doesn't ask to say it by the mouth, it's enough to say it mentally</code>}, and he need not say the latter {<code>the Shita Mekubetset says that they they tell about Vayomer.</code>}? - The recital of Shema' is preferable, because it has two points.  R' Eleazar says: if one is in doubt whether he has recited the Shema' or not, he says the Shema' again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this passage we see that it would be possible to mention the Exodus from Egypt by an other passage, e.g. the Beracha of Emet Veyatsiv, for Arvit Emet Veemuna, but it's preferable to mention it inside the Kriat Shema. Note that even in KS of the day, the issue of mentioning Tsitsit is obviously not Deorayita and maybe not Derabanan. Vayomer is mentioned in Mishna in the second Chapter of Berachot as said after and not before Vehaya Yim Shamoa because it addresse a Mitsva made in the day, Misvat Tsitsit. (<strong>note that the Mishna doesn't say that Vayomer has to be said because of Mitsvat Tsitsit</strong>). So to order the 3 Parashiot of Shema, Vayomer is the last because it mentions the Mitsvat Tsitsit that is a Mitsva of the day (Rashi in Mishna). But the Gemara quoted above shows that a Baal Keri says it mentally because of the Yetsiat Mitsrayim, and we understand from the Gemara that for the same reason the Baal Keri says it mentally, even at night because the duty of mentioning the Exodus is even in night, according to Rabbi Eleazar Ben Azaria (last Mishna of the first chapter) and we follow his line.

    "content": "# Berachot 3a - Did Tosafot mix up the tannaic opinions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first couple of pages of Masechet Berachot deal largely with the various tannaic opinions as to the earliest time for the recital of Shema at night. The Talmud tries to figure out which of these opinions are in conflict with each other.</p>\n<p>The original opinion mentioned in the Mishnah was משעה שהכהנים נכנסים לאכול בתרומתן – when <em>kohanim</em> that had been impure can eat <em>terumah</em>. One Beraita cited contains R. Meir's opinion that the earliest time is משעה שבני אדם נכנסין לאכול פתן בערבי שבתות – when people eat on Friday night. Another Beraita has R. Meir of the opinion that it is משעה שהכהנים טובלין לאכול בתרומתן – when the <em>kohanim</em> perform their ritual ablution.</p>\n<p>The Talmud notes that R. Meir seems to have two contradictory opinions here, and it answers that it was in fact a tannaic dispute as to what R. Meir really held. This brings us to Tosafot.</p>\n<p>Tosafot is ostensibly explaining why the Talmud did not offer another possible way to avoid the contradiction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דלא מצי למימר בשעה שבני אדם נכנסין וכהן חד שעורא הוא דאם כן רבי מאיר היינו רבי אחאי לפי' רש\"י שפי' שרוב בני אדם נכנסין להסב דהיינו בע\"ש</p>\n<p>It couldn't say that \"the time that people enter\" is the same as \"kohen\" because  if that were the case then R. Meir would be the same as R. Achai, according to the explanation of Rashi who explains that [the time of] \"most people enter to dine\" is on Friday night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The term \"the time that people enter\" is R. Meir's view in the first beraita. The term \"kohen\" is the view in the Mishnah. The term \"most people enter to dine\" is the view of R. Achai in the last <em>beraita</em>.</p>\n<p>In essence, then, Tosafot is saying that R. Meir's view in the first <em>beraita</em> cannot be identical with the view in the Mishnah because then (according to Rashi's explanation) it would be identical with R. Achai's opinion in the last <em>beraita</em> (and R. Meir in that same <em>beraita</em> is ostensibly arguing with R. Achai.</p>\n<p>I see several potential issues here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Why does Tosafot raise the possibility that R. Meir's view in the first <em>beraita</em> is the same as the view in the Mishnah? It is already clear from the Talmud that this cannot be, for R. Meir in that <em>beraita</em> is disputing the Sages who give the same time that the Mishnah does (i.e. \"kohen\").</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How would it help if R. Meir in the first <em>beraita</em> is in agreement with the Mishnah? The current question being dealt with is not how to reconcile R. Meir with the Mishnah, but how to reconcile R. Meir with his own opinion in the later <em>beraita</em> where he gives the time as משעה שהכהנים טובלין לאכול בתרומתן</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If, as Rashi explains, R. Achai's opinion of משעה שרוב בני אדם נכנסין להסב is referring to Friday night, then the issue of R. Meir being the same as R. Achai exists even without positing that R. Meir's view is identical to that of the Mishnah.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What I would have expected here would have been for Tosafot to say that you can't say that R. Meir in the first <em>beraita</em> (משעה שבני אדם נכנסין לאכול פתן בערבי שבתות) is identical to R. Meir in the second  <em>beraita</em> (משעה שהכהנים טובלין לאכול בתרומתן) because then R. Meir in the second <em>beraita</em> would be saying the same thing as his disputant R. Achai. That would be a simple explanation for why the Talmud had to resort to saying that there was a dispute about R. Meir's opinion. But that does not seem to be what Tosafot is saying.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Am I missing something here? Is there perhaps a textual emendation that switches the terms in Tosafot around a bit? Or is it possible that Tosafot mixed up some of the opinions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Meir says 2 different things:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מֵאֵימָתַי מַתְחִילִין לִקְרוֹת קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע בְּעַרְבִית — מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁבְּנֵי אָדָם נִכְנָסִין לֶאֱכוֹל פִּתָּן בְּעַרְבֵי שַׁבָּתוֹת, דִּבְרֵי רַבִּי מֵאִיר. וַחֲכָמִים אוֹמְרִים: מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁהַכֹּהֲנִים זַכָּאִין לֶאֱכוֹל בִּתְרוּמָתָן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מֵאֵימָתַי מַתְחִילִין לִקְרוֹת שְׁמַע בָּעֲרָבִין — מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁקָּדַשׁ הַיּוֹם בְּעַרְבֵי שַׁבָּתוֹת, דִּבְרֵי רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר. רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ אוֹמֵר: מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁהַכֹּהֲנִים מְטוֹהָרִים לֶאֱכוֹל בִּתְרוּמָתָן. רַבִּי מֵאִיר אוֹמֵר, מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁהַכֹּהֲנִים טוֹבְלִין לֶאֱכוֹל בִּתְרוּמָתָן. אָמַר לוֹ רַבִּי יְהוּדָה: וַהֲלֹא כֹּהֲנִים מִבְּעוֹד יוֹם הֵם טוֹבְלִים? רַבִּי חֲנִינָא אוֹמֵר מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁעָנִי נִכְנָס לֶאֱכוֹל פִּתּוֹ בְּמֶלַח. רַבִּי אַחַאי וְאָמְרִי לַהּ רַבִּי אַחָא אוֹמֵר: מִשָּׁעָה שֶׁרוֹב בְּנֵי אָדָם נִכְנָסִין לְהָסֵב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why does Tosafot raise the possibility that R.

It is impossible to 'burn' the upper one, so they were only mentioning the fact that the lower one was destroyed to say that he shouldnt destroy the upper one.\nFor instance if one cant eat cream only cheese. Do you tell him so and so eats cream and cheese so why dont you eat cheese (he cant eat cream) or do you tell hi  so and so eats cheese why dont you.\nHere as well do you say why do you destroy the upper (you cant burn it) because you destroyed and burned the lower, or do you say why do you destroy the upper because you destroyed the lower without mentioning burning which cant be done on the upper. </p>\n\n<p>from AVODA BERURA by RABBI MITNICK OF HAR NOF</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3vjBq.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3vjBq.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

And Rabenu Yitschak answered that here is an exception to the rule (in Avodat Yom Hakippurim), the verse tells (Leviticus 16.10) \"the goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell\", and says afterward \"and offer him for a sin offering\". And he answered a second answer, the Cohen Gadol is zeleous and moreover he is not alone, there are Deputy Hight Priest and the Ministering Family who can remember him if he forgot to say Chatat. And Tosfot (the author is the Mordechai) gives a third answer, the right answer in his opinion, that generally when someone says \"Lashem\" and no more it is a vain mention of the name of G-d, but here, even if he says \"Lashem\" and nothing more because the mention of the name of g-d is the end of the lot. As he says that what he take in his right hand is for the g-d, as it is the case for Rabbi Yishmael. The fact that for Tana Kama he needs to say \"Chatat\" is only a consequence of the verse. …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to the question of Tosfot (and the answers doesn't contradict it), one should never say a sentence beginning by the Name of God.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question about verses, obviously, Prophets say what g-d said them to say and there is no prohibition because they pronounce the name of g-d following the order of g-d.</p>\n\n\n",

Does it matter if one is confident that he will be granted such permission?</p>\n\n<p>If one may not do so, why was Yosef allowed to swear this way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In this particular case, we see that Yosef did not want to <strong>swear</strong> as his father asked, because he wanted to say that he would do all that he could himself. While normally he should only have sworn to ask Par'o for permission to bury Yaakov, Yaakov knew that only an absolute oath given in the full sense (just as Eliezer swore to Avraham) could have allowed the burial to take place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8242/showrashi/true#v30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vay'ch 47:30</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְשָֽׁכַבְתִּי֙ עִם־אֲבֹתַ֔י וּנְשָׂאתַ֨נִי֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם\n  וּקְבַרְתַּ֖נִי בִּקְבֻֽרָתָ֑ם וַיֹּאמַ֕ר אָֽנֹכִ֖י אֶעְשֶׂ֥ה\n  כִדְבָרֶֽךָ:</p>\n  \n  <p>I will lie with my forefathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt,\n  and you shall bury me in their grave.\" And he said, \"I will do as you\n  say.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Art Scroll commentary cites Ramban and Seforno explain that Yaakov understood that Par'o would regard it as an insult to Egypt and to himself as embodying the Egyptian state.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This did not imply a lack of trust in Joseph. Rather, Jacob made a\n  realistic assessmane of the political problem that would arise when\n  Joseph sought permission for the burial outside of Egypt. Pharoah\n  would take it as an insultto the land that had given generous\n  hospitality to Jacob and his family, and he would understand the\n  request as a demonstration that Israel's allegience did not belong to\n  Egypt. Only if Joseph were to take a solemn oath would Pharaoh deem it\n  improper to stand in the way. Indeed, when Pharaoh gave permission to\n  Joseph, he emphasized that he was doing so <strong>because</strong> Josephe had\n  sworn to do so <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8245/jewish/Chapter-50.htm/showrashi/true#v6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see 50:6</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, we see that as part of the request, Yosef emphasized that his father had <strong>made him swear</strong> a solemn oath that he would be buried in the cave that had been set up as the sacred burial ground that had <strong>already been prepared</strong> and was waiting for him. Yosef also said that the oath required him to do this himself (and not through a <em>shaliach</em>) and implicitly promised Par'o that he would come right back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8245/jewish/Chapter-50.htm/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vay'chi 50:5</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'My father adjured me, saying, \"Behold, I am going to die. In my\n  grave, which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall\n  bury me.\" So now, please let me go up and bury my father and return.'\n  \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He put it in terms that Par'o would understand that the ground was already sacred to his father and that Yaakov had insisted on a solemn and sacred oath. This meant that any attempt to stop him from carrying out the oath could have caused the bracha that Yaakov had given Par'o and the land of Mitzrayim could have been revoked. Had such an oath been broken, then the entire land would have been cursed. The title of <em>oathbreaker</em> was a very serious one and would never have been allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, that is why Yosef included his return to Egypt as (implicitly) part of the oath made to his father when he spoke to Par'o.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, Par'o ensured the return by only allowing the brothers to accompany their father, keeping all of the rest of the family as hostages under his <em>protection</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

It is obvious that someone cannot be a mass murderer and then recite Ashrei and be absolved. Rather, this statement should be understood as a proxy of sorts, that one who performs this praiseworthy action, which strengthens his faith, is likely to possess the traits required for the world to come.</p>\n\n<p>With that understanding, we can begin to discuss why the acrostic is relevant. The Pnei Yehoshua posits that both the acrostic and the verse serve to reinforce the notion that God created the world for the sake of those who study the Torah. Here is the full piece. The bold parts are my addition. (If anyone knows of a translation, please feel free to edit)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שם אמר ר\"א אמר רבי אבינא כל האומר תהלה לדוד בכל יום ג\"פ מובטח כו' <strong>ונראה שהכוונה בזה שע\"י שיאמר זה המזמור ג\"פ בכוונת הלב בתלת זימני הוי חזקה ותתחזק האמונה האמיתית בלבו שכל העולם כולו לא נברא אלא לצוות לזה למי שעוסק בתורה שנתנה ע\"י כ\"ב אותיות הא\"ב שיש בזה המזמור וכל הנבראים והנעשים לא נבראו אלא בשביל כך כנודע ויכוון ג\"כ בפסוק פא\"י ומשביע לכל חי שהקב\"ה זן ומפרנס עולמו מקרני ראמים עד ביצי כנים וכולם מתפרנסים שלא ביגיעה ושלא בצער</strong> וכדכתיב לעיל מיניה בזה המזמור עיני כל אליך ישברו ואתה נותן להם את אכלם בעתו א\"כ בודאי החי יתן על לבו ויאמר למה זה הבל וריק איגע כל היום לעשות מלאכתי קבע לעסוק בצרכי פרנסה שמכיון שכל הנבראים שאינן אלא לצוותא בעלמא מזמן להם הקב\"ה פרנסתן שלא ביגיעה כ\"ש שראוי ונכון שיעשה כן לשומרי בריתו ולזוכרי פקודיו שהם עיקר ויסוד העולם שיזמן להם פרנסתן שלא ביגיעה. וכמאמר הכתוב השלך על ה' יהבך והוא יכלכלך ונאמר ג\"כ לא ראיתי צדיק נעזב וגו'. נמצא שמתוך כך בודאי יעשה מלאכתו עראי ומלאכת שמים קבע כמ\"ש חז\"ל שכל העושה כך זה וזה נתקיים בידו. וזה שאמר מובטח לו שהוא בן ע\"ה וק\"ל. והשתא אתי נמי שפיר שתקנו חכמים לומר כל הג' פעמים ביום ולא בלילה סמוך לתפילת ערבית משום שעיקר יגיעות ועמל האדם במלאכתו הוא באותו זמן שאחר תפילת שחרית וכדכתיב יצא אדם לפעלו ולעבודתו עדי ערב. עד אחר תפלת המנחה כנ\"ל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For instance, Zeraim deals primarily with agricultural laws, but one tractate (Berachot) concerns the rules for prayers and blessings. Nashim deals with the laws related to marriage and women, but Nazir is also there. Nezikin deals largely with Jewish criminal and civil law and the Jewish court system, but, again, there is Avot with no apparent connection in there. Is there any take on that?</p>\n\n<p>PS: I'm not advocating an Order that would fit better, but an explanation for why they are in these places.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>First for Avot and Berachot, see Rabenu Yona on Avot 1.1/</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ארז”ל (ב\"ק ל.) האי מאן דבעי' למהוי חסידא לקיים מילי דאבות ואמרי לה מילי דנזיקין ומפני שאדם משיג אל מעלת החסידות בעשותו אחת מאלה הדברים שמוה בסדר נזיקין. ואע\"פ שגם כן אמרו לקיים מילי דברכות והוא מסדר זרעים מפני שמדברת מברכות הזרעים והפירות שמוה בסדר ההוא (אמר המעתיק עיין במדרש שמואל מה שכתב בענין זה בשם רבי יוסף נחמיאש ז\"ל) . ועוד מפני שהם דברי הסנהדרין שמוה בסדר הדינים וכן כל החכמים הנזכרים עד רבן יוחנן בן זכאי כלם מן הסנהדרין</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Yona quotes the Gemara in BK 30a Rab Judah said: He who wishes to be pious must [in the first instance particularly] fulfil the laws of [Seder] Nezikin.But Raba said: The matters [dealt with in the Tractate] Aboth; still others said: Matters [dealt with in] Berakoth. Rabbenu Yona assumes that the Chachamim wanted to group the three in Seder Nezikin because this common feature.But since the tractate of Berachot deals with the brachot of vegetals they include it in Seder Zerayim. {an example of the importance know good Zerayim to know what to bless is the use of Masechet Maasrot for goats}. Avot has an additional reason to be in Nezikin, its link with Sanhedrin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nedarim and Nazir are in Nashim because of they address Hafara from the Husband, the father, and all this need knowledge in Nashim and is relevant for the Hilchot Nashim. I will further give more sources.</p>\n<p>Gemara Sota 2a.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now that the Tanna has finished [Tractate] Nazir, what is his reason for continuing with [Tractate] Sotah? - It is according to the view of Rabbi; for it has been taught: Rabbi says, Why does the section of the Nazirite adjoin that of the suspected woman? To tell you that whoever witnesses a suspected woman In her disgrace should withhold himself from wine. But [the Tanna in the Mishnah] should treat of [Tractate] Sotah first and afterwards that of Nazir! - Since he treated of [Tractate] Kethuboth [marriage-settlements] and dealt with the theme, 'He who imposes in vow upon his wife', he next treated of [Tractate] Nedarim [Vows]; and since he treated of [Tractate] Nedarim, he proceeded to treat of [Tractate] Nazir which is analogous to Nedarim, and then continues with Sotah for the reason given by Rabbi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rambam in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to the Mishnah</a> gives an explanation for the order of every Seder and reasons of inclusion of various masechtot.\nFor example, Brachot in Zraim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he divided the material in the Order of Seeds, as I will say: He began with the Tractate of Blessings (Berakhot). And the reason that required him to begin with it is that when an expert physician wants to preserve the health of a healthy person upon the state that it is in, he begins by ordering the dietary regimen at the beginning of his medical prescriptions. And therefore, this sage saw [fit] to begin with Blessings, as anyone who eats does not have allowance to eat until he recites a blessing. And [so], he saw fit to order Blessings at the beginning of his words, so that he would order the food in a regimen that has substance to it.\n  Afterward he saw [fit] to organize his words so that it would not be lacking any matter of all the matters, and therefore he spoke about the [entire] category of the blessings that a person is obligated about for nourishment and for the commandments. And the only commandment that a person is obligated about every day is the recital of Shema alone. And it is not correct to speak about the blessings over the recital of Shema before he speaks about the recital of Shema itself. Therefore, he began, \"From when do we recite the Shema,\" and everything that is connected to it.\n  And afterwards, he went back to the topic of the Order, and that is to speak about the commandments of the seed of the earth. Etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nazir in Nashim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And after Ketubot is Nedarim (Vows); as the whole section of vows (in the Torah) and its examination is [about] the vows of women, as it is stated (Numbers 30:17), \" between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter.\" And when the marriage is complete and the woman enters the marriage canopy, her husband has the authority to abrogate her vows. And because of this he made Nedarim adjacent to Ketubot.\n  And after Nedarim, he arranged Nezirut (Nazirite Separation), because 'nezirut' is also in the category of vows, and when a woman vows to be a nazirite, her husband can abrogate [it]. And therefore, he arranged Nezirut after Nedarim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and Avot in Nezikin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when he finished everything that the judge would need, he started with Avot (Fathers). And he did this for two [reasons]:\n  The [first] one is to inform that the consensus and the received tradition are true and correct; and that it was received [one generation] from [another]. And therefore, it is fitting to honor a sage of [the tradition] and to place him in an honored status, since the teaching came to him; and he is in his generation like those [sages of the tradition] in their generations. And so did they say (Rosh Hashanah 25a), \"If we have come to call the court of Rabban Gamliel into question, etc.\" They said, \"Shimshon in his generation was like Aharon in his generation; Yiftach in his generation was like Shmuel in his generation.\" And about this matter, there is a great ethical teaching for people: that they not say, \"Why should we accept the judgement of x or the ordinance of Judge y?\"\n  And the matter is not like this, as judgement does not belong to Judge y, but rather to the Holy One, blessed be He, who commanded us about it, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 1:17), \"for judgment is God’s.\" Hence it is all one judgement, and they received it one man from another through the passing generations.\n  And the second matter is that he wanted to remember in this tractate the ethical teaching of each sage among the sages, peace be upon them, so that we learn the virtues from them. And there is no man that needs this thing more than the judges – as when unlearned people would not be masters of virtue, damage would not accrue to the masses, but rather only to [the person in question], but when a judge would not be a master of virtue and modest, he would damage himself and damage [others].\n  Therefore the start of his words in Tractate Avot was judicial ethics, as he said, \"Be deliberate in judgment.\" And the judge must be restrained by all of the matters that are in Tractate Avot – for example, that he be deliberate in judgement, and not be quick to execute a legal decision, as it is possible that there be a hidden matter in that case, as they said [about such a case], peace be upon them, \"A deceitful case.\" Etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Interestingly R Sherira Gaon was asked a very similar question by the Rabbis of Kairouan (see his Iggeret of R Sherira Gaon): why are the tractates arranged the way they are? What for instance does Kippurim (Yoma) come before Shekalim or Succah before Yom Tov (Beitzah)?</p>\n\n<p>R Sherira Gaon answers that Rebbi (who composed the Mishna) did not lay down a particular sequence of tractates at all, however the order of Mishnayot within tractates comes from him (see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.102a.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baba Kama 102a</a> where Rav Huna writes we accept the order of mishnayot across tractates is not sequential).</p>\n\n<p>He goes on to explain that in his yeshiva they have a different order of tractates in places (actually very much like the order we know today) but writes that anyone may change the order if he wishes.</p>\n\n<p>He concludes that there are places in the gemara where the order is obvious, e.g., Nazir-Sotah (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.2a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 2a</a>) or Makot-Shevuot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.2b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see Shevuot 2b</a>) as there are statements to that effect.</p>\n\n<p>So it appears a certain order got solidified over time but is not necessarily the only order possible.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is a mitzvah fulfilled if its fulfillment is based on an averah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sukkah.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 2:3</a> says that if one builds a sukkah on top of a camel or a tree, it is valid, but one may not use it during yom tov (but may during chol ha-moed).  Rashi adds that if one uses it on yom tov anyway, he has nevertheless fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>Can a mitzvah be called fulfilled even if it is built on an averah? Does it make a difference if the mitzvah is biblical and the averah is only rabbinic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While this is a complex topic, here are the major details:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can a mitzvah be called fulfilled even if it is built on an averah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>No</strong></p>\n<p>A stolen Lulav is invalid on the second day of Sukkot. The reason given on sukkah 30A is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משום דהוה ליה מצוה הבאה בעבירה שנאמר (מלאכי א, יג) והבאתם גזול ואת הפסח ואת החולה גזול דומיא דפסח מה פסח לית ליה תקנתא אף גזול לית ליה תקנתא לא שנא לפני יאוש ולא שנא לאחר יאוש</p>\n<p>It is unfit because it is a mitzva that comes to be fulfilled by means of a transgression, which renders the mitzva unfulfilled, as it is stated: “And you have brought that which was stolen and the lame, and the sick; that is how you bring the offering; should I accept this of your hand? says the Lord” (Malachi 1:13). Based on the juxtaposition in the verse, it is derived that the legal status of a stolen animal is equivalent to that of a lame animal. Just as a lame animal, because it is blemished, has no remedy and is unfit for use, so too, a stolen animal has no remedy. There is no difference before the owners reach a state of despair of recovering the stolen animal, and there is no difference after despair. In both cases there is no remedy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the talmud cites another opinion, this is the accepted one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mishnah Sukkah 2:3 says that if one builds a sukkah on top of a camel or a tree, it is valid, but one may not use it during yom tov (but may during chol ha-moed). Rashi adds that if one uses it on yom tov anyway, he has nevertheless fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a case of Mitzvah Habaah Biaveirah, but a classic example of something which is invalid Lechatchila but ok Bdieved. The Rabbis forbade climbing a tree or riding an animal because one might come to break a branch, either while climbing or to hit the animal with. However, they did not invalidate the Mitzvah of Sukkah if it was done in this method. This is quite different from the case of using a stolen Lulav.</p>\n<p>The Tosafists make distinctions between different kinds of Mitzvot acomplished through an Aveirah (3 if my memory serves), but I believe that is beyond the scope of this answer.</p>\n\n\n",

Yochanan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי שמעון בן לקיש כל העוסק בתורה יסורין בדילין הימנו שנאמר ובני רשף יגביהו עוף ואין עוף אלא תורה שנאמר התעיף עיניך בו ואיננו ואין רשף אלא יסורין שנאמר מזי רעב ולחומי רשף אמר ליה רבי יוחנן הא אפילו תינוקות של בית רבן יודעין אותו שנאמר ויאמר אם שמוע תשמע לקול ה' אלהיך והישר בעיניו תעשה והאזנת למצותיו ושמרת כל חקיו כל המחלה אשר שמתי במצרים לא אשים עליך כי אני ה' רופאך אלא כל שאפשר לו לעסוק בתורה ואינו עוסק הקב\"ה מביא עליו יסורין מכוערין ועוכרין אותו שנא' נאלמתי דומיה החשיתי מטוב וכאבי נעכר ואין טוב אלא תורה שנאמר כי לקח טוב נתתי לכם תורתי אל תעזובו</p>\n<p>R. Simeon b. Lakish says: If one studies the Torah, painful sufferings are kept away from him. For it is said: And the sons of reshef fly upward. The word 'uf refers only to the Torah, as it is written: 'Wilt thou cause thine eyes to close upon it? It is gone'. And 'reshef' refers only to painful sufferings, as it is said: 'The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the reshef [fiery bolt]. R. Johanan said to him: This is known even to school children.  For it is said: And He said: If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His eyes, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee which I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord that healeth thee.  Rather [should you say]: If one has the opportunity to study the Torah and does not study it, the Holy One, blessed be He, visits him with ugly and painful sufferings which stir him up. For it is said: I was dumb with silence, I kept silence from the good thing, and my pain was stirred up. 'The good thing' refers only to the Torah, as it is said: For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not My teaching.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_5.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reish Lakish presented a lesson derived from a verse, and R. Yochanan objected. He clearly didn't object to the content of the lesson, as he immediately presents an even more basic source for the same lesson. It would seem, then, that he was objecting to the derivation of that lesson from this specific verse, when the verse should actually teach us something else. But then when he tells us what that something else is (that if you don't study Torah you will receive pain) he cites a completely different verse. So what did he accomplish if he didn't even use the verse that Reish Lakish was explicating?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I suspect that he's not rejecting that Reish Lakish is indeed hermeneutically interpreting Job 5:7 correctly, if only by virtue of the fact that Rav Yochanan's own principle is more difficult to derive from the words of the verse.  Rather, I think he's rejecting the impression from Reish Lakish's statement that that is the full extent of the consequence of <em>bitul torah</em> - that one forfeits the special protection rewarded for the positive act of Torah study.  Instead, Rav Yochanan posits that <em>bitul torah</em> is not only a lack of something proactively <em>positive</em> - it's an inherent <em>negative</em> deserving of specific punishment - an idea which he then supports with Psalms 39:3.</p>\n\n\n",

He replied to him: Moses, the righteous man who prospers is the righteous man the son of a righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is a righteous man the son of a wicked man. The wicked man who prospers is a wicked man son of a righteous man; the wicked man who is in adversity is a wicked man son of a wicked man.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Master said above: 'The righteous man who prospers is a righteous man son of a righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is a righteous man son of a wicked man'. But this is not so! For, lo, one verse says: Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and another verse says: Neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers. And a contradiction was pointed out between these two verses, and the answer was given that there is no contradiction. The one verse deals with children who continue in the same course as their fathers, and the other verse with children who do not continue in the course of their fathers! — [You must] therefore [say that] the Lord said thus to Moses: A righteous man who prospers is a perfectly righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is not a perfectly righteous man. The wicked man who prospers is not a perfectly wicked man; the wicked man who is in adversity is a perfectly wicked man. Now this [saying of R. Johanan] is in opposition to the saying of R. Meir. For R. Meir said: only two [requests] were granted to him, and one was not granted to him. For it is said: And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, although he may not deserve it, And I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy, although he may not deserve it.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_7.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that there was a dispute among the <em>tannaim</em> as to whether Moses was able to understand the ways of God, particularly about bad things happening to good people and vice versa. R. Yosi claimed that this is something that God explained to him – and two potential explanations are given. R. Meir, though, apparently holds that God did not explain this to Moses. Moses therefore was unable to understand the ways of God in this area, and presumably no other human could as well.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=39b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 39b</a> we are told that the cause of Acher's heresy was that he couldn't understand God's justice:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתניא רבי יעקב אומר אין לך כל מצוה ומצוה שכתובה בתורה שמתן שכרה בצדה שאין תחיית המתים תלויה בה בכיבוד אב ואם כתיב למען יאריכון ימיך ולמען ייטב לך בשילוח הקן כתיב למען ייטב לך והארכת ימים הרי שאמר לו אביו עלה לבירה והבא לי גוזלות ועלה לבירה ושלח את האם ונטל את הבנים ובחזירתו נפל ומת היכן טובת ימיו של זה והיכן אריכות ימיו של זה אלא למען ייטב לך לעולם שכולו טוב ולמען יאריכון ימיך לעולם שכולו ארוך ודלמא לאו הכי הוה ר' יעקב מעשה חזא ודלמא מהרהר בעבירה הוה מחשבה רעה אין הקב\"ה מצרפה למעשה ודלמא מהרהר בעבודת כוכבים הוה וכתיב למען תפוש את בית ישראל בלבם איהו נמי הכי קאמר אי סלקא דעתך שכר מצוה בהאי עלמא אמאי לא אגין מצות עליה כי היכי דלא ליתי לידי הרהור והא א\"ר אלעזר שלוחי מצוה אין נזוקין התם בהליכתן שאני והא אמר רבי אלעזר שלוחי מצוה אינן נזוקין לא בהליכתן ולא בחזירתן סולם רעוע הוה דקביע היזיקא וכל היכא דקביע היזיקא לא סמכינן אניסא דכתיב ויאמר שמואל איך אלך ושמע שאול והרגני אמר רב יוסף אילמלי דרשיה אחר להאי קרא כרבי יעקב בר ברתיה לא חטא ואחר מאי הוא איכא דאמרי כי האי גוונא חזא ואיכא דאמרי לישנא דחוצפית המתורגמן חזא דהוה גריר ליה דבר אחר אמר פה שהפיק מרגליות ילחך עפר נפק חטא </p>\n  \n  <p>For it was taught: R. Jacob said: There is not a single\n  precept in the Torah whose reward is [stated] at its side which is not dependent on the resurrection of\n  the dead. [Thus:] in connection with honouring parents it is written, that thy days may be\n  prolonged, and that it may go well with thee. In reference to the dismissal of the nest it is written,\n  that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. Now, if one's father said to\n  him, ‘Ascend to the loft and bring me young birds,’ and he ascends to the loft, dismisses the dam and\n  takes the young, and on his return falls and is killed — where is this man's happiness and where is\n  this man's prolonging of days? But ‘in order that it may be well with thee’, means on the day that is\n  wholly good; and ‘in order that thy days may be long’, on the day that is wholly long.</p>\n  \n  <p>Yet perhaps there was no such happening? — R. Jacob saw an actual occurrence. Then perhaps\n  he was meditating upon a transgression? — The Holy One, blessed be He, does not combine an\n  evil thought with an [evil] act. Yet perhaps he was meditating idolatry, and it is written, that I may\n  take the house of Israel in their own heart? — That too was precisely his point: should you think\n  that precepts are rewarded in this world, why did the [fulfilment of these] precepts not shield him\n  from being led to [such] meditation?</p>\n  \n  <p>Yet R. Eleazar said: Those who are engaged on a precept are never harmed? — There, when\n  they are going [to fulfil the precept], it is different. But R. Eleazar said: Those who are engaged on\n  a precept are never harmed, either when going or returning? — It was a rickety ladder, so that injury\n  was likely, and where injury is likely one must not rely on a miracle, for it is written, and Samuel\n  said: How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Joseph said: Had Aher interpreted this verse as R. Jacob, his daughter's son, he would not\n  have sinned. Now, what happened with Aher? Some say, he saw something of this nature. Others\n  say, he saw the tongue of Huzpith the Interpreter dragged along by a swine. ‘The mouth that\n  uttered pearls licks the dust!’ he exclaimed. [Thereupon] he went forth and sinned.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there a connection between these two passages? Is it just a coincidence that Acher rejected Judaism because of his problems with Divine justice, and his student R. Meir was the one that asserted that it is impossible to understand Divine justice? Or was R. Meir perhaps influenced in some way by what happened to his teacher, and his interpretation in Berachot was a response to that?</p>\n\n\n",

Chameitz She'avar alav HaPesach, leaven that we retainined in our possession over Passover, is such a category -- in fact, <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/articles/chametz-sheavar-alav-hapesach-the-supermarket-controversy-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> site says that one may not even return chameitz items purchased on Pesach for a refund as that constitutes benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Benefit, though, confuses. me. I know from learning parts of Masechet Sukkah (Schottenstein 31b2, note 19, referencing R\"H 28a), that one does not derive benefit simply by fulfilling a mitzvah (that is, the status of having been mekayem the mitzvah is not inherently benefit), so I assume that one's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chametz#Removal_of_chametz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">burning</a> the leftover chameitz, though he might gain spiritually by being yotzei an obligation, is not \"hana'ah\". Daf 35a(3) note 24 references Masechet Shabbat 25a-b which says that one may derive more physical and practical benefit from the burning of T'rumah which has become tamei, like using the fire as fuel in an oven. But I do not see that there is a blanket issur of hana'ah for said T'rumah.</p>\n\n<p>Where there is such a law, like by forbidden chameitz, can one derive similar secondary benefit through the destruction of the leaven? Does fulfilling the obligation to burn it and then using the flame to create warmth in a house, or run an oven in which other food is cooked, or to dry clothes etc. constitute a forbidden benefit in the same way that a direct benefit (reselling it, feeding it to one's animals etc.) does?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.445.2?lang=bi&\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 445:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם שרפו קודם שעה ששית הרי זה מותר ליהנות בפחמין שלו בתוך הפסח אבל אם שרפו משעה ששית ולמעלה הואיל והוא אסור בהנאה הרי זה לא יסיק בו תנור וכירים ולא יבשל ואם בישל או אפה אותה הפת ואות' התבשיל אסורים בהנאה וכן הפחמין שלו אסורים בהנאה הואיל ושרפו אחר שנאסר בהנאה:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>If one burns it [<em>chametz</em>] before the the sixth hour [of <em>erev pesach</em>] one may obtain benefit from the charcoal during <em>pesach</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if one burns if from the sixth hour and onwards, since it became forbidden to benefit from it, one may not use it to stoke an oven or stove and one one may not use it [as fuel] for coooking.</p>\n  \n  <p>And if one cooked or baked [using it as fuel] then the loaf or dish [that was baked or cooked] are forbidden to derive benefit from, and the charcoal [obtained from the <em>chametz</em>] is also fobidden to derive benefit from, since he burnt it after it became forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He brought the suffering of illness upon Hezekiah and told Isaiah: Go and visit the sick. Isaiah did as God instructed, as it is stated: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came and said to him: Thus says the Lord of Hosts: Set your house in order, for you will die and you will not live” (Isaiah 38:1). This seems redundant; what is the meaning of you will die and you will not live? This repetition means: You will die in this world, and you will not live, you will have no share, in the World-to-Come. Hezekiah said to him: What is all of this? For what transgression am I being punished?\n  Isaiah said to him: Because you did not marry and engage in procreation.\n  Hezekiah apologized and said: I had no children because I envisaged through divine inspiration that the children that emerge from me will not be virtuous. Hezekiah meant that he had seen that his children were destined to be evil. In fact, his son Menashe sinned extensively, and he thought it preferable to have no children at all. Isaiah said to him: Why do you involve yourself with the secrets of the Holy One, Blessed be He? That which you have been commanded, the mitzva of procreation, you are required to perform, and that which is acceptable in the eyes of the Holy One, Blessed be He, let Him perform, as He has so decided. Hezekiah said to Isaiah: Now give me your daughter as my wife; perhaps my merit and your merit will cause virtuous children to emerge from me.\n  Isaiah said to him: The decree has already been decreed against you and this judgment cannot be changed.\n  Hezekiah said to him: Son of Amoz, cease your prophecy and leave. Hezekiah continued: I have received a tradition from the house of my father’s father, from King David, the founding father of the dynasty of kings of Judea: Even if a sharp sword rests upon a person’s neck, he should not prevent himself from praying for mercy. One may still hold out hope that his prayers will be answered, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found this a bit odd: At first Chizkiyah says that he saw in a prophecy that his descendants will be evil - meaning, done-deal, nothing can be done. And then, when Yesha'ayhu tells him that it's already been decreed that he'll die - again, meaning done-deal, nothing can be done - he says: No way, I have a masoret from my forefather King David that even in the face of the worst danger, a person still has the chance to turn things around.\nIs this supposed to be ironic - that in terms of his descendants, Chizkiyah didn't think this masoret had relevance, but when it became personal - it did, or is this a reflection of his Tshuva process from the beginning of the agadeta to the end? Or is it both? Or something else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My interpretation:</p>\n\n<p>Chizkiyah knows from the beginning, that there is always \"a chance to turn things around\", but he also knows that chances are slim, so he does not take the risk.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah tells him that he sinned for doing God's calculations, and now he is doomed. Chizkiyah, knowing that there is always a chance, goes for a double bet - not only that he will live, there is a chance that his decedents will also won't be evil [well, that didn't happened, as we said, chances are slim].</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A partial answer following the Peri Tsadik, linked by Sefaria on the page in the category chasidut.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאפי' חרב חדה היינו שכבר נגזר הדין ע\"פ ב\"ד שלמעלה עכ\"ז יוכל להתהפך הכל לטוב מצד רחמי שמים וזה אל ימנע עצמו מן הרחמים דייקא</p>\n<p>The discussion is about the words of Yeshaya \"כבר נגזרה גזירה\" it's already decided, you will die. The allegory of \"חרב חדה מונחת על צווארו\" Even if a sharp sword rests upon a person’s neck speaks about the decree that has been decreed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The information is new for Chizkyia. The didn't know that. Now he wants to fight the decree.</p>\n<p>Before this his reason he never did Piria Verivia was to avoid giving birth to Reshayim. There was no decree about a child who already born. He needs not engender a problem and then to pray to fight the problem.</p>\n<p>So, there is no contradiction.</p>\n<p>Regarding the request to marry the daughter of Yeshaya and to combine both merits, it is a way to giving birth to good offspring. Before that he didn't have a good wife as a daughter of the Navi. But if now it's possible, he think that to marry is right. But anyways even if there is a decree he is not desperate because of the tradition from David. May be he is ready to make Piria Verivia and even ready to give birth to Reshaym, he will try to save his life.</p>\n\n\n",

Your human guests are way more important than having the nicest possible wine.</p></li>\n<li><p>I use a \"night light\" in each bathroom rather than leaving the regular lights on.  It's way too easy to instinctively turn the lights off when leaving the room, even if you've been told about the Shabbat/lights issue.

A non-Jew using a cell phone doesn't put the host in a <em>halachically</em> problematic position; it's just a distraction.  So cast the request in terms of that distraction, and if it happens, don't make a big deal out of it.  (If they want to take pictures or record singing, a gentle \"please don't\" should suffice -- people can be reluctant to be recorded or photographed for all sorts of reasons, and people are generally aware of this fact in my experience.

They are both halachically accepted forms of assumptions based on the probability that a certain outcome will repeat itself. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>There are many types of <em>chazakos</em> and <em>rovs</em>, so it's good to define our terms before  we compare them. What both of them have in common is they tend to address <em>sefeikos</em>, or uncertainties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chazaka D'MeIkara חזקה דמעיקרא</strong></p>\n\n<p>Basically, assume what was, will be. For example: חזקת כשרות, חזקת פנויה, חזקת אשת איש, חזקת איסור, or in English: something is still kosher, someone is still single, someone is still married, something is still forbidden. Even if you see that something has changed, you assume it changed at the last possible moment. While assuming things don't change could be logical (status quo), this latter novelty is not logical. It is a decree of the writ, a גזרת הכתוב. See <strong>Chullin 10b</strong> for the source and discussion on this type of <em>chazaka</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chezkas HaGuf חזקת הגוף</strong></p>\n\n<p>Similar to חזקה דמעיקרא, basically put it's the assumption that something physical hasn't changed. See <strong>Kesubos</strong> 12b for an example. Some say that this is stronger that a typical חזקה דמעיקרא (see <strong>Shev Shemaatesa</strong> 1:15).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chezkas Mammon חזקת ממון</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <em>gemarra</em> (<strong>Bava Kamma</strong> 46b) calls this logical, to the point that you don't even need a source for it. Essentially it's the assumption that your possessions are yours until proven otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Behavioral Chazakos חזקה אדם וגו'‏</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the assumption that people usually act a certain way. For example חזקה אין אדם עושה סעודה ומפסידה, we assume a person won't make a wedding feast only to ruin his marriage the next day (<strong>Kesubos</strong> 10a). חזקה אין אשה מעיזה פניה בפני בעלה, a woman wouldn't brazenly lie in front of her husband that he divorced her (<strong>Gittin</strong> 64b). More on this below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chezkas Gimmel Pa'amim חזקת ג' פעמים</strong></p>\n\n<p>We assume something that happened three times will continue to happen (שור המועד (<strong>Exodus</strong> 21:29), קטלנית (<strong>Yevamos</strong> 64b)).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soklin al HaChazakos סוקלין על החזקות</strong></p>\n\n<p>Something that we assumed was true due to some proof (a single witness (see <strong>Mishneh Torah</strong> <em>Hilchos Sanhedrin</em> 16:6), logic), we will use even to execute punishments. For example, a new couple comes to town with two children. They act as a family, so we assume they're all related. If they commit incest together, they are punished based off that <em>chazaka</em> (<strong>Kiddushin</strong> 80a).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <em>gemarra</em> in <strong>Chullin</strong> 11a teaches that there are two types of <em>rov</em>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ruba DeIsa Kaman רובא דאיתא קמן</strong></p>\n\n<p>A <em>rov</em> where the majority is before us. The classic example is 9 stores in town sell kosher meat and one sells non-kosher, and you find a piece of meat. <em>Rov</em> tells you to assume this piece of meat came from the majority.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ruba DeLeisa Kaman רובא דליתא קמן</strong></p>\n\n<p>A <em>rov</em> where the majority isn't before us. There are different ways to define this. One way is this <em>rov</em> isn't known with cold-hard facts, it's just something that is generally known to be true (see <strong>Kovetz Shiurim</strong> I <em>Bava Basra</em> § 83, see there further for other explanations). For example, most animals are not born with a life-threatening blemish or illness. Or most people are not born infertile.</p>\n\n<p>There are also different applications of <em>rov</em>. The above are referred to as <strong>Heilach achar HaRov</strong>, following the majority. Another application is <strong>Bittul BeRov</strong>, where in a mixture the minority becomes nullified and is considered like the majority.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, coming back to your question. I'm not sure which <em>chazakos</em> and <em>rovs</em> you and your friend were discussing, but my assumption is <strong>Behavioral Chazakos</strong> and <strong>Ruba DeLeisa Kaman</strong>. These work very similarly, since another way to phrase \"there's a <em>chazaka</em> that a person would/not do X\" as \"most people do/don't do X\". As noted by @JoelK, there are those that explicitly equate the two. <strong>Rav Asher Weiss</strong> in <strong>Minchas Asher</strong> <em>Vayikra</em> § 25 provides a proof that this is true. <strong>Chullin</strong> 11b suggests a source for <strong>Ruba DeLeisa Kaman</strong> is the fact that someone who bruises their father is sentenced to death, even though it's not known for sure who their father is. Rather, it's because <em>rov beilos achar haba'al</em>, even if the mother was unfaithful, most of the time she is with her husband. We therefore assume she became pregnant from him. The <em>gemarra</em> calls this a <em>rov</em>, yet the <strong>Yerushalmi Kiddushin</strong> 4:10 explains this case is the source for <em>chazaka</em>. Seemingly it's referring to <strong>Behavioral Chazakos</strong>, and thus the terms <em>chazaka</em> and <em>rov</em> in this context are interchangeable. See also <strong>Kiddushin</strong> 80a, which seems to call a <em>rov</em> a <em>chazaka</em> at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Not so other <em>chazakos</em> and <em>rovs</em>. You're right they both are assumptions that solve uncertainties, but they work differently, and they have different rules and laws. Some want to say that a <strong>Chazaka D'MeIkara</strong> doesn't answer the question, just tells you how to act, while <strong>Rov</strong> answers your uncertainty (see <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%95%D7%96%D7%A7_%D7%94%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA#cite_ref-2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for some sources). There's a rule that <em>rov</em> is stronger than certain <em>chazakos</em> (<strong>Niddah</strong> 18a), yet <em>rov</em> doesn't beat <strong>Chezkas Mammon</strong> (<strong>Bava Kamma</strong> 27b). They're not interchangeable or equatable. As well, clearly <strong>Bittul BeRov</strong> is different than <em>chazakos</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are indeed opinions which essentially understand certain forms of <em>chazakah</em> as a <em>rov</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, R. Yisrael Isserlein writes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1835&st=&pgnum=66&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Terumat HaDeshen 207</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חזקה שאינה פוסקת <strong>שהיא באה מכח הרוב</strong> כמו החזקה אין עדים חתומים על השטר אא\"כ נעשה גדול וכן חזקה אין אדם פורע בגו זמנו וחזקה שאין אדם עושה בעילת בעילת זנות דכל הני חזקות <strong>באים מן הרוב כלומר רוב בני אדם אין עושים אלא בענין זה</strong> אפילו בדיני נפשות סמכינן אחזקה כה\"ג‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A <em>chazakah</em>  which does not cease, <strong>which comes from the power of <em>rov</em></strong>, such as the <em>chazakah</em> that witnesses do not sign a document if they are underage, or the <em>chazakah</em> that a person does not repay a debt early, or the <em>chazakah</em> that a person will not make his act of sexual intercourse into an improper one, all these <em>chazakot</em> <strong>come from the power of <em>rov</em> i.e. most people only act in this way</strong>. We rely on such a <em>chazakah</em> even in capital cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Shimon Shkop in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53353&st=&pgnum=54&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sha'arei Yosher 3:3</a> distinguishes between a <em>chazakah</em> solely based on statistics (such as the <em>chazakah</em> that a woman will not falsely claim to her husband's face that he has divorced her) and a <em>chazakah</em> that is based on both statistics and a certain internal logic (such as the <em>chazakah</em> that people do not repay debts early).</p>\n\n<p>He understands, based on the principle of <em>ein holchin bemamon achar harov</em>, that the former kind of <em>chazakah</em> cannot be used to extract money from a defendant, suggesting that this kind of <em>chazakah</em> is indistinguishable from <em>rov</em>. However, the latter kind of <em>chazakah</em> is strong enough to extract money; a <em>chazakah</em> based on logic as well as statistics is stronger than one based on statistics alone.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to look at these types of <em>chazakot</em> in a way that is different from <em>rov</em>, is to understand them as discussing the way we perceive the world, rather than performing a statistical analysis.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, R. Moshe Sofer in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Responsa_Chatam_Sofer%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.67?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Responsa Chatam Sofer Choshen Mishpat 67</a> writes of the <em>chazakah</em> that a debt is not repaid early that it is 'as if we are witnesses' (<em>anan sahadi</em>) that such is the case, and that such a <em>chazakah</em> can therefore be used to extract money. Similarly, R. Aryeh Leib HaKohen Heller in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%AA%D7%90/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%90_%D7%95/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%9B%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shev Shmat'ta 6:22</a> writes that this <em>chazakah</em> is based on logic (<em>sevara</em>) and is thus stronger than <em>rov</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The way I understand their approaches (although I grant that this is not necessarily the only way to read them) is that a <em>chazakah</em>, while it might be ultimately be based on a statistical phenomenon, takes on a life of its own when (for whatever reason) it becomes a feature of how people view the world. This is in distinction to a pure <em>rov</em> (such as the majority of animals do not have a fatal illness) where we are not coming in with any prior assumptions, and it is the questions that are asked which require us to perform a statistical analysis in order to come up with an answer. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not going to go through the whole topic right now, and whatever I can say will be in contention. Rov is separated into 2 separate categories, one of which is based upon a פסוק in the Torah, אחרי הרבים להטות. This rov is called רובא דאיתא קמן and is based upon the majority of the current possibilities before us. What is considered 'before us' is a subject of debate. This is not a logical statistical conclusion. The רש\"ש on בבא בתרא (צג:) brings down an argument in the פוסקים if in the classical case of תשעה חנויות (9 stores sells kosher and one sells non-kosher) what if the one large non-kosher store sells more meat per day than the other 9 kosher stores. Do we go based upon the number of stores or the volume of meat. This is a seemingly obvious question, as statistically the volume of meat is what determines the probability. But the question is if רובא דאיתא קמן looks at the amount of meat or the number of stores. This is to prove that רובא דליתא קמן is not statistics.\nחזקה, as Robev explained earlier, is not one thing. There are many different types of חזקות, the most common of which is חזקה דמעיקרא. This is also based upon a פסוק and is not statistical. An example is if I have two knives, one of which is kosher for שחיטה and one of which is not, and I grab one of them and use it to perform שחיטה. Afterwards I realize that I don't know which knife I use. חזקה makes the cow not kosher. This is again illogical, as there is nothing that says that since the cow was not kosher before, therefore I picked up knife a instead of knife b. This type of חזקה is called a הנהגה, a halachik tool that says when in doubt pick me.\nרובא דאיתא קמן is the most statistical of the bunch. It says that being that most people do x, or nature dictates y, they are more likely to be true. This type of rov is called a בירור by some, and actually establishes how we should look at the reality, not just a when in doubt do... sort of thing. I wrote a paper on this a while back if you're interested.</p>\n\n\n",

However, when I told my Dad about this book he had strong objections because the book was written by a Catholic so he says that a Jew is not supposed to read such books. His objections mainly stem from the fact that he uses Greek philosophers arguments such as Aristotle and Plotinus and claims that Jews do not use Greek philosophy because it is pagan and foreign to us. To my knowledge this is not true because Rambam used Aristotle in his \"Guide for the Perplexed\", when I told him this he claims that Rambam had a special mind to separate the good from the bad (not sure what kind of argument that is) and that I don't have the mind for it and will get brainwashed and become a heretic by reading this book. He also objects because the author uses arguments put forth by Aquinas who was a Catholic and Augustine who was also Catholic. Lastly the author uses Leibniz who I believe was also a Christian.</p>\n\n<p>My dad tells me that I should look for specifically Jewish philosophers who philosophically argue for the existence of G-d, problem is a lot of the arguments were effective in the time they were living and not as relevant today.

Jokes aside, Maimonides wrote in his monumental Guide of the Perplexed that, the truth is the truth no matter what its source. He, therefore, had no quarrels accepting the philosophy from the Greek pagan Aristotle. Some scholars even feel that Maimonides considered Aristotle to be a prophet. In any event, Rambam derived most of his philosophy from non-Jews. As a result, he did not always cite his philosophical sources since the vast majority of them came from non-Jews. He feard that if he had they could prompt Jews to abandon his works altogether.</p>\n\n<p>My own view is that I think you are right to study works from Jews, as well as non-Jews.

One should not dismiss Feser because he is a non-Jew or Einstein because he was irreligious. That would be foolish.

    "content": "# Jewish theological position concerning Zionism and the State of Israel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Several orthodox groups, most notably Neturei Karta and Satmar, are opposed to the State of Israel on religious grounds. According to them, since the messiah has not yet arrived, the Jewish people have yet to earn the spiritual merit to establish a country in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>It's clear that this strict position is not universally shared in the orthodox world. Considering that to be the case, I was wondering what theological justification other groups may use in order to take a more lenient approach. </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ultra-orthodox-anti-zionist/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ultra-orthodox-anti-zionist/</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To explain the lenient theological explanation, it is first important to understand what the basis of the opposition towards the state of Israel is.\nIn extremely short:\nThe medrash on shir hashirim cites 3 oaths that were made, 2 by the jewish people and one by the nations of the world:\nJewish people:\n 1. not to ascend to Eretz Yisrael as a wall before the coming of moshiach\n2. not to rebel against the nations and force the end of the exile\nNations:\nnot to overly oppress the jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the creation of the state of Israel, using warfare, went against one or both of these oaths is the main ideological reason why people are opposed to it.\nAs I said this is extremely simplified and summarised. I'm happy to expand if you want to know more.</p>\n\n<p>I will try to list some of the ideological justifications of the other groups as I can remember them, I am sure there are more: (please note that for every one of these justifications, the opposition has plenty explanations).\n1. The three oaths are aggadeta and not halacha, proof being that the rambam doesn't cite them in his codification of halacha.\n2. there are prophecies which allude to a jewish state before the coming of moshiach\n3. Due to Balfour declaration and UN decision, the establishment of the state does not constitute a rebellion against the nations\netc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>I will probably get down votes from both sides of the fence but I have tried to be bipartisan. If you are interested in this topic, there are many books on the subject which go through the issue in detail. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kavana or Ma’aseh? What Matters?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Ohr Hachaim explains Breishit 50:20 by way of a mashal: someone intended to give his fellow poison but ended up giving him wine.  The perpetrator is not deemed to be chayav for what he intended to do.</p>\n\n<p>Ohr Hachaim’s comment above seems at odds with Rashi’s comment on Bamidbar 30:6 (dibbur hamatchil “va’Hashem yislach la”).  Rashi gives the example of a woman who takes a neder to become a nazir while her father hears and secretly annuls the neder but she transgresses her neder. She needs slicha because kavana (and seemingly not the ma’aseh) is what matters.  In the case of the Ohr Hachaim’s example it seems that the ma’aseh (and not kavana) matters. Why is it the opposite for both cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi is referencing the Gemorah in Kiddushin 81B which speaks about doing Teshuva and needing a Kappora for doing an action you think is forbidden when unbeknownst to you it really isn't. In such a situation a person has to do Teshuva.  And if someone did something they thought was forbidden which indeed was forbidden the obligation of Teshuva is even bigger.</p>\n\n<p>The Ohr HaChaim OTOH  is discussing <em>judging</em> that person in the court system. A human court would never convict someone (of actual, not attempted, murder) for intending to give his fellow poison but giving him wine instead. The Ohr HaChaim learns the Posuk before the one being discussed as Yosef saying that I cannot judge you only Hashem will. He then continues in this Posuk to say that  Hashem should exonerate you because the same way a human court would not convict someone for giving wine instead of poison, so too Hashem in his heavenly court should exonerate you for the act of selling me due to the results.</p>\n\n<p>The Ohr HaChaim doesn't say or mean that on a <em>personal</em> level the Shevatim had no reason to do Teshuva if what they did was wrong.</p>\n\n\n",

Or is one addressing oneself? Or is one addressing Yaakov Avinu, who is called Yisrael?\nOther?\nPlease cite reliable sources, preferably early sources. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From Chabad Chassidus:  </p>\n\n<p>In Rabbi Aaron Raskin's book \"Letters Of Light\" the word Yisrael is defined as a contraction.</p>\n\n<p>\"Jews are called b’nei Yisrael—the children of Israel. Yisrael means both לי ראש—“I am the head,” and שר א-ל—“minister of G‑d.”</p>\n\n<p>The footnote for this cites Likutei Torah Devarim.</p>\n\n<p>When I say Shema, I am thinking about the entire nation as eternal ministers of G-d.  \"Eternal\" comes from the yud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is clear from the context of the source <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Devarim 6:4)</a> that it is referring to the Jewish people. For example, the previous verse includes \"And you shall listen Yisrael\" when discussing obeying the commandments and inheriting the land of Israel. The context of all these verses is Moshe talking to the Jewish people: Chapter 5 begins with \"Moshe called <strong>to all of Yisrael</strong> and said to them \"Hear, Yisrael, the statutes and ordinances...\". </p>\n\n<p>The word \"Yisrael\" in the Shema recitation therefore means the Jewish people, however <em>you</em> are not addressing the Jewish people, rather you are reciting a verse which is addressed to the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>(The Gemara Pesachim 56a says that the phrase 'Baruch shem...' was inserted into Shema because Yaakov responded with those words when his sons said 'Shema Yisrael'. Although in that instance the word Yisrael was referring to Yaakov, that is not the source for our recitation of Shema. The source is the aforementioned verse in Devarim, which as mentioned previously is not referring to Yisrael the individual but to the entire Jewish people. That's why to me it doesn't seem correct to have in mind the Patriarch Yisrael when reciting the word even though that's what it once meant in a different context.)   </p>\n\n\n",

Towards the end, we give thanks to God as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>רִבּוֹן</strong> כָּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים, <strong>אֲדוֹן</strong> כָּל הַנְּשָׁמוֹת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are some sources which speak of the difference between רבון and אדון?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are dozens of sources that are all hard to find and probably can’t help you find your answer anyway.</p>\n<p>רבון comes from the root רבב, which indicates abundance, increasing intensity, greatness, and similar concepts. Thus, רבון describes someone who is great and full of power.</p>\n<p>אדון is a bit unclear, but is likely from the root אדנ, which means lordship (in the same sense as in English), as well as sturdy support. אדון, then, apparently means a lord whose position of rulership is secure. But again, this word’s root derivation is difficult, so I’m not so sure.<br />\nIt is likely that the author of this prayer simply meant “lord”.</p>\n<p>In fact, there’s a decent chance that רבון and אדון were synonymous in the author’s time, maybe with very slightly different connotations, and he only used the separate terms for poetic purposes. I would ask him if I could, but unfortunately the Jewish Time Machine exploded after someone accidentally hit it with the Jewish Space Laser, and will have to be rebuilt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>רבון is from the two letter root רב which can mean either <em><strong>Master</strong></em>, like is used in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.23b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 23b</a> which says in the name of Rav Shmuel Bar Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי אֲתָא <strong>רַב שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר יְהוּדָה, אָמַר, רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן</strong> תַּרְתֵּי אָמַר: נִרְאִים דְּבָרִים <strong>שֶׁהָעֶבֶד מְקַבֵּל גֵּט לַחֲבֵירוֹ – מִיָּד רַבּוֹ שֶׁל חֲבֵירוֹ</strong>, אֲבָל לֹא מִיַּד רַבּוֹ שֶׁלּוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or <em><strong>Teacher</strong></em>, like is used in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.63b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 63b</a> which says in the name of Rabbi Abahu:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אָמַר רַבִּי אֲבָהוּ:</strong> אָמַר לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לְמֹשֶׁה: עַכְשָׁיו יֹאמְרוּ <strong>הָרַב בְּכַעַס וְתַלְמִיד בְּכַעַס</strong>, יִשְׂרָאֵל מַה תְּהֵא עֲלֵיהֶם? אִם אַתָּה מַחֲזִיר הָאֹהֶל לִמְקוֹמוֹ — מוּטָב, וְאִם לָאו — יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בִּן נוּן תַּלְמִידְךָ מְשָׁרֵת תַּחְתֶּיךָ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is like the expression you quote in your question:</p>\n<p>רִבּוֹן כָּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים, which translates as <em><strong>Teacher of all actions</strong></em>. That we learn proper actions, meaning the performance of Mitzvot, from our Rav, like Moshe Rabbeinu was the Teacher of the Torah and its commandments to all Israel.</p>\n<p>And also from the expression mentioned in the comments:</p>\n<p>רבונו של עולם, which translates as <em><strong>Master of the universe</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>אדון is from the three letter root אדן which means <strong>base</strong> or <strong>pedestal</strong>, as in <em>footing</em>, like the <strong>bases</strong> or <strong>pedestals</strong> of the Mishkan, אדני המשכן mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.35.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 35:11</a>.</p>\n<p>That like with the Mishkan, the footings have a dual function. Because of their weight, they serve to provide a firm connection with the earth below and they also help to hold the  structural elements of the Mishkan together cohesively because part of their form is the sockets in which the tenons of the wall boards are inserted in an interlocking fashion.</p>\n<p>אדון itself has a meaning of aristocratic title, as in <strong>Lord</strong>, like the <em><strong>House of Lords</strong></em> in the British Parliament. It is important to emphasize that the term <strong>Lord <em>does not mean</em> King</strong>.</p>\n<p>A Lord is a loyal servant to the King and under the King's authority, but because of favor from the King, a Lord is over common subjects. This is usually delineated by a grant of special authority over certain jurisdictions and subjects. This is like the usage from Rambam in regard to Moshe Rabbeinu who is called <strong>Lord of all the Prophets</strong> (אדון כל הנביאים) in Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Commandments, Commandment 362:1.</p>\n<p>So the proper translation of אֲדוֹן כָּל הַנְּשָׁמוֹת is <em><strong>Lord of all Neshamot</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The root of אדון is אדן. It has meaning to <em>sustain and provide base</em>. The silver sockets supporting the <em>kerashim</em> of the Mishkan were called אדנים - <em>adanim</em> (Heard in the name of R. Gershenfeld from yeshivah Machon Shlomo). The root of רבון is רבב. It has meaning to <em>increase to large quantities</em>. (Source \"Etymological dictionary of Biblical Hebrew\" by R. Matityahu Clark.) Therefore, <em>adon</em> describes the master's aspect of <em>providing support</em> of his subordinates, whereas <em>ribbon</em> describes the master's aspect of being <em>multifaceted</em>, <em>mighty</em>.

Ibn Ezra does not perceive the word סבלותיכם as addressed to Moses and Aaron, but as referring to the forced labour of the masses of the Israelites whom they claimed to represent. Some commentators claim that even the ordinary Israelites did not have to join the workforce until they had reached the age of nine, and that they could “retire” at the age of 60.    Nachmanides writes that according to the plain meaning of the words Pharaoh told Moses and Aaron to rather perform their duties for their King, together with the remainder of the nation, seeing that on that occasion Moses and Aaron appeared before him accompanied by the common people. Pharaoh therefore told those people to get back to work instead of wasting their time dreaming of an illusory redemption. When Moses and Aaron, instead of complying with Pharaoh’s command, appeared before him once more, he commanded them to legitimize themselves by means of a miracle. Once Moses and Aaron had done so, he no longer looked upon them as part of the common people but respected them as elders, as sages. Once they had begun to decree plagues upon Egypt, he no longer treated them only with deference, but with fear, with dread. It appears that not all of the Israelites were slaving away making and laying bricks all the time, for if so the country would have become a large heap of bricks. Making bricks was a tax imposed by Pharaoh on the entire population, but the Israelites were singled out by working far longer hours and by having to supply a much larger percentage of their manpower.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

II Samuel 24:9 tells us that King David took a census that resulted in a plague that killed seventy thousand Israelites. But counting or taking a census in the Bible could be done in order to determine the availability for war, for the division of land, and for tax purposes. But what did David do wrong and why were innocent people, indeed seventy thousand of them, killed by a plague?</p>\n\n<p>In the story, David orders his commanding general Joab to assemble the soldiers to tally people. The procedure ends after nine months and twenty days, when Joab returns with the count of eight hundred thousand men, along with an additional five hundred thousand from Judah as reserves which could be mobilized in a time of war. When David heard this report he immediately began to regret ever having taken the census. For the count has been made public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides think</strong></p>\n\n<p>In his Guide of the Perplexed 2:48, Maimonides explains that whenever the Bible says that G-d did something, it is not that G-d actually did it but what occurred was the result of the laws of nature. Since G-d created the laws of nature, the Bible attributes the event to G-d, since G-d is the ultimate cause. If we understand the text in this way, we can posit that G-d did not really become angry (Rambam felt that G-d does not have emotions).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did David take the census?</strong></p>\n\n<p>David probably undertook the census to gauge how many men or to procure potential soldiers that he could muster for an anticipated battle since David engaged in many wars. For the census, David dispatched his senior officers to determine who was fit for military service. However, the census was done publicly which came to the attention of Israel’s enemies, the very nations that David was assembling forces to fight. When the enemies learned of the census they took preventative measures and mapped out the area of drafting disseminated along Israel's boarder, resulting in an ambush of David’s forces. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural consequences</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the census, David lamented it was too late. There was nothing he could do but face the consequences. The world functions according to the laws of nature, and one of those laws is that every act has a consequence. Thus, the prophet Gad had three possibilities for David’s negligent behavior. David could have fought the enemy or famine might arise as what happened to Saul. The plague was the result of a great slaughter [decomposing corpses]. Alternatively, the seventy thousand men were killed in battle, a “plague.” This number would have been much smaller had the census not been publicized. After the plague, Gad told David to set an altar where the plague has stopped, as a remembrance for David not to make the same mistake twice. The phrase “David’s Heart Smote Him” is a metaphor for David’s regret since the ancients considered the heart to be the seat of wisdom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The last chapter of the biblical book of Samuel, if taken literally describes an angry G-d pushing David, resulting in deaths of tens of thousands. This is theologically problematic. But if we read according to Maimonides’ teaching in Guide 2:48, it can be explained in a more rational manner. David was punished due to natural consequences. When David dispatched a military contingent to take a census over a nine-month period which was mistakenly publicized. We can surmise that the enemy discovered the secret, fought or ambushed David’s army, resulting in the deaths of seventy thousand men, followed by a three-day plague.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why were the plagues necessary if God hardened Pharaoh's heart?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah tells us that God hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the Israelites go. [Ex. Ch. 4-14] Some commentators [e.g., Sforno] explain that this was in order to allow Pharaoh to repent and let the Israelites go of his own free will, without being pressured by events. </p>\n\n<p>The thinking is: The impact of the plagues was so devastating that a free Pharaoh would have felt compelled to let Israel go, just to stop his people's suffering. This would not be a sign of true submission.  It would be a fake repentance, a means to an end. Therefore, God made him less sensitive to the pain inflicted around him, so that he will have the free will to truly repent if he so chooses. </p>\n\n<p>If so, then why were the plagues necessary?  Why would God send plagues, presumably to pressure Pharaoh, while at the same time making sure he would resist such pressure?</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the reason, was this fair to the Egyptian people?

(Several scholars have written on this theme, and a general Google search will provide plenty of examples.) For example, the divine judgment of darkness in Egypt was against Ra, the Egyptian sun-god. The last and consummating judgment was Passover, when the majestic power of Pharaoh, who was deified by the Egyptians, was judged. The death of his firstborn (along with everyone/everything else firstborn) was the sum total judgment of God against the “deity” of Pharaoh and all the gods of Egypt. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.12?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 12:12</a></strong> (Sefaria)</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>12</sup> For that night I will go through the land of Egypt and strike down every first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; <strong><em>and I will mete out punishments to all the gods of Egypt, I the LORD</em></strong>.

For example, if they (apostate Israelites) had worshiped the sun, the moon, the stars, and/or the planets, and/or things for which there was a ‘need’ in the world and through whom there was a benefit in the world, the jealousy by God would not have been aggravated; in this case, however, they worship demons personified through idols which, not only do not benefit them, but cause them harm through demon-possession (which is aggravated assault upon the dignity of God according to <em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.318.13?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim</em> 38:13</a>). <sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, the hardening of Pharaoh's heart was <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>visible</strong> narrative of the Exodus story.

    "content": "# Allegory vs. Literalism in Judaism and How to Tell the Difference\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the following article, the author makes a compelling argument for why Judaism doesn't always approach scripture literally. However, although there are many examples throughout the Bible for the use of allegory, some passages are in fact taken literally. For example, Kosher laws are implemented in that manner. How then can you tell the difference? Is there any method or approach for telling the difference between whether allegory or literalism is appropriate? Other questions on Stack Exchange mentioned allegory and literalism, but I couldn't find any that directly address this specific point. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/genesis-as-allegory/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/genesis-as-allegory/</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that this determination is not much different than other determination about the meaning of a text, which is made on a case-by-case basis.  One has to use logical analyses of the information presented, both inherently (regarding clues in the text itself) and in a broader context, including whether or not there is a relevant and reliable (Mosaic) tradition one way or the other.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15a.16?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Bathra 15a</a>, a view is presented that the entire story of Job is just an allegory describing events and individuals that never were.  This approach is ultimately rejected based on an analysis of the presentation of specific, seemingly irrelevant details.</p>\n\n<p>An \"allegory\" is essentially a way of describing the patterns of an idea or event with another symmetric idea or event. This complicates the analysis inasmuch as there are often symmetries and \"supersymmetries\" in history, creation, and commandments.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, the commandments themselves are often <strong>sym</strong>bols (i.e. allegories) put into practice.  Thus, traditionally, tefillin are <em>literally</em> worn as signs upon the arm and between the eyes.  Likewise, <em>maaseh avoth siman l'banim</em> means that actual historical events that occurred to the forefathers, are a sign of events to come that would befall their descendants.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, with regard to more general rules, I would venture that an idea that is frequently described as a \"secret\" (e.g. <em>sod bereishith</em>) is more likely to include more encoded information.  And contradictions may also be a likely clue that at least one of two passages are not literal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>How to really understand the Bible</strong></p>\n\n<p>Good question. For one, anthropomorphic statements about G-d should always be taken figuratively as metaphors. For example, Maimonides understood the \"Garden of Eden\" story to be a parable. Ralbag understood that the sun did not really stand still for Joshua at Gibeon, this was a feeling Joshua felt \"as if\" the sun stood still.</p>\n\n<p>In his work called Chelek, Maimonides writes that those who take Midrashim literary are \"fools,\" while those who reject them out of hand are also \"fools.\" Midrashim are imaginative parables, sermons designed to teach moral lessons. People should mine Midrashim for lessons about proper behavior. The same can and should be applied to Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>In his Guide of the Perplexed 2:48, Maimonides explains that whenever the Bible says that G-d did something, it is not that G-d actually did it but what occurred was the result of the laws of nature. Since G-d created the laws of nature, the Bible attributes the event to G-d, since, though not the direct cause,  G-d is the ultimate cause. </p>\n\n<p>Be it as it may, even some biblical laws are metaphors. For example, the laws of tefillin, though very ancient, were probably not from Sinai. But they are still sacred and very powerful. But as the Rashbam points out when comparing them to Mishle (Proverbs), the original intent was figurative. The term Haza\"I \"halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai means that they should be related to \"AS IF.\" A slippery slope?</p>\n\n<p>No, Maimonides stressed that the Kosher laws, tefillin, and all biblical and rabbinical enactments should be observed as the rabbis explained them (as per Deuteronomy 17).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the concluding supplication after kidush levana formulated as a personal prayer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many Ashkenazi <em>sidurim</em> (e.g. Artscroll and the <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/siddur-vilna/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sidur Vilna</em></a>), <em>kidush l'vana</em> concludes with a supplication that the greatness of the moon be restored, and that the Jewish people merit the restoration of Davidic reign. In modern <em>sidurim</em> that I've seen, the formulation is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויהי רצון מלפניך ה' א-להי וא-להי אבותי למלאות פגימת הלבנה... ויתקים בנו מקרא שכתוב ובקשו את ה' א-להיהם ואת דויד מלכם (הושע ג:ה) אמן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rough translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And may it be Your will, HaShem my G-d and the G-d of my forefathers, to replenish the moon from its deficiency… and may the verse be fulfilled through us (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1303.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hoshe'a'</em> 3:5</a>): \"And they shall seek HaShem their G-d and David their king.\" Amen. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This formulation can be traced back at least to R' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_ben_Ezekiel_ibn_Gabbai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meir ibn Gabai</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43096&pgnum=109\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Tola'as Ya'akov</em>, ברכת הלבנה</a>, c. 1506), though he does not use precisely the same <em>nusach</em> and he does not specify mentioning either א-להי (\"my G-d\", which would seem to connote a personal aspect to the prayer) or א-להינו (\"our G-d\", which would seem to suggest a communal aspect). </p>\n\n<p>However, the modern formulation specifically mentions א-להי וא-להי אבותי (\"my G-d and the G-d of my forefathers\"), thus apparently connoting a personal aspect to the prayer.<sup>1</sup> However, the context of the prayer seems communal or universal rather than personal.<sup>2</sup> </p>\n\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How did the current formulation (including \"א-להי וא-להי אבותי\") develop and become the standard <em>nusach</em> for Ashkenazim?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there a particular reason why this formulation includes the words \"א-להי וא-להי אבותי\" rather than \"א-להינו וא-להי אבותינו\"?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub> See <em>Y'rushalmi</em> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.33a.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 33a</a>) for examples of supplications by individual sages, some of which seem to be supplications for the community and still use singular language (also some use plural language). In contrast, see the <em>Bavli</em> (<em>B'rachos</em> <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=16b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">16b</a>-<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=17&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17a</a>) where only the plural is used for communal supplications (the two instances of the singular form are unarguably prayers on behalf of individuals). Per <em>B'rachos</em> <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=29b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">29b</a>-30a, \" אמר אביי לעולם לישתף איניש נפשיה בהדי צבורא\", one might speculate that some of the supplications mentioned in plural form in the <em>Y'rushalmi</em> (though nevertheless using \"א-להי\") are primarily meant as personal prayers. Note, though, that this principle of Abaye's is the basis for his ruling that even a lone traveler should recite <em>T'filas HaDerech</em> in the plural, with א-להי specifically changed to א-להינו, among other changes (<em>Shulchan 'Aruch</em> OC 110:4, see also <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 110:20 that this extends to any prayer that was instituted with a plural/communal formulation, though note the dispute over the appropriate form for <em>'Aneinu</em> during an individual's fast <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 565:5). See also <em>Shulchan 'Aruch</em> OC 119:1.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>\nThe <em>Chasam Sofer</em> (<em>Chulin</em> 60a) mentions that, although HaShem will repair the deficiency of the moon in the future, He made that restoration dependent on our deeds. Since our sins delay the messianic era and the restoration of the moon, HaShem commanded us to offer the <em>chatas</em> sacrifice of Rosh Chodesh (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=26&daf=9&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sh'vu'os</em> 9a</a>, דאמר ר\"ל... אמר הקב\"ה שעיר זה יהא כפרה על שמיעטתי את הירח). Perhaps, then, the prayer after <em>kidush l'vana</em> may be a disguised request for HaShem to help each individual repent from our sins and seek out HaShem and the Davidic kingdom (as in the above mentioned verse from <em>Hoshe'a'</em>). Even so, the <em>se'ir</em> of Rosh Chodesh is a communal offering, and <em>Hoshe'a'</em> 3:5 is written in the plural, suggesting that, even as a supplication for repentance, this prayer appears to have more of a communal aspect than a personal one.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding lack of accountability for statements made while suffering\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Bava Batra 16b Rava two verses for Iyov are compared</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(איוב לד, לה) [איוב] לא בדעת ידבר ודבריו לא בהשכל (וכתיב (איוב מב, ז) כי לא דברתם אלי נכונה כעבדי איוב)</p>\n<p>On the one hand, the text states: “Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom” (Job 34:35). But on the other hand, it is written with regard to Job’s friends: “You have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, like my servant Job” (Job 42:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To resolve the seeming contradiction Rava explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבא מכאן שאין אדם נתפס בשעת צערו</p>\n<p>Rava said: From here it may be inferred that a person is not held responsible for what he says when he is in distress</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning that Elihu's statement that Iyov's words are without knowledge is technically correct, but Iyov is not held responsible for his mistaken speech because he spoke while he was suffering.</p>\n<p>I would like to understand this statement in light of the premise of the book of Iyov overall. In the first two chapters the Satan has a conversation with God where he posits that the reason Iyov serves God is because Iyov is protected and essentially everything is well with him and his possessions. Remove that, argues the Satan, and Iyov will curse (written euphemistically as 'bless' in the pasuk) God to his face. To test this theory the Satan is given permission by God to cause the loss of all of Iyov's possessions and to physically afflict Iyov. But, given Rava's statement that a person is not held responsible for statements made while suffering, I cannot understand how Satan's test makes sense. If Iyov were to curse God as Satan suggests he would, wouldn't that curse be considered words said while in pain and therefore not be held against Iyov?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I am aware that some commentators explain \"אין אדם נתפס בשעת צערו\" to mean that a person is not punished for antinomian statements as opposed to those statements being considered as if they were not said at all. I do not find this reading compelling from the context of the Gemarah and the pesukim and will not accept this explanation as the correct answer</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's a difference between saying something foolish and outright blaspheming.  Also, as per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Dessler</a>'s doctrine of <em>nekudath habechira</em> (see <em>Michtav Me’Eliyahu - Kuntrus HaBechira</em>) the goalposts may move - i.e. one is still accountable for one's choices but the expectations (and responsibility) are lowered by more trying circumstances.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>More background on the conversation between Hashem and the Sotton is useful to understand this. </p>\n\n<p>Hashem had said that Iyov was a tremendous Tzadik. The Sotton responded that he really wasn't such a Tzadik,  he just has everything going for him. Were he to find himself in difficult straits he would no longer be such a Tzadik. The Sotton was correct about that. Iyov did not remain the great Tzadik he had once been in face of tremendous pain and adversity. </p>\n\n<p>OTOH he also is not to be considered  a <em>bad</em> person for the way he responded due to the pain that led him to do so. </p>\n\n<p>It is often said that the difference between Gadol and a regular person is that (1)the more you get to get to know a gadol the more you see their virtues, the more you see a regular person the more you realize their faults (2) more relevant to here, a gadol is someone who remains a gadol  no matter where you meet them, no matter what situation behind their control they find themselves in, whether they are surrounded by followers or imprisoned in Siberia they still act with gadlus. </p>\n\n<p>That was the test Iyov had. Had he not reacted the way he did would have been on par with the Avos. Now that he did his behavior is understandable in light of the pain  he was in</p>\n\n\n",

Such an evil state has been prophesied to us in the words, \"They shall run to and fro to seek the word of God, but shall not find it\" (Amos viii. 12); \"Her king and her princes are among the nations, the law is no more, her prophets also find no vision from the Lord\" (Lam. ii. 9).

    "title": "multiple wives decrease onah of each",
    "content": "# multiple wives decrease onah of each\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Rambam, Hilchot Ishut, Chapter 14:1, he outlines a husband's obligations of onah (conjugal rights) to each wife based on his profession.  So a sailor every 6 months, an in-town laborer twice per week and so on.  </p>\n\n<p>In applying this to a husband with multiple wives, one could say he must satisfy each wife this often, so a sailor with 4 wives must be with each every 6 months, a laborer with each wife twice/week (requiring more than 1 per day somewhere in that week) and so on.  Alternatively, one could say he is obligated to provide conjugal rights to some wife this often, but each particular wife less frequently. This would mean that the sailor with 4 wives is only obligated to satisfy each only once in 2 years.</p>\n\n<p>In thinking about clothes and food, clearly more wives mean the husband has more obligation.  He can't provide them with the food for 1 wife and say they must share it.  Similarly, he can't provide 1 dress and tell the other wives to go nude.  This accords with Rambam in halacha 3 there, that he may have additional wives only so long as he can afford them all and doesn't reduce clothes, food, or conjugal rights.</p>\n\n<p>This suggests that the obligation in onah is like the first option above, and a man with 4 wives is obligated in onah 4 times as often as a man with the same profession and 1 wife.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in halacha 4, the Rambam says explicitly that it is like the second option and the husband of 4 wives has the same onah responsibility as the husband of 1, but that obligation is spread and divided between the wives.  So a worker with 2 wives is obligated to each weekly (instead of twice/week) and if he had 4 wives, he would be obligated to each only once in 2 weeks.  </p>\n\n<p>How does this not contradict halacha 3, that he cannot take wives if it will reduce his food clothing or conjugal duties to the existing wives?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Issur Zalman Meltzer in Even Haazel says to delete the word \"Onah\" (conjugal rights) in Ishus Halacha 14,3 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאר כסות ועונה כראוי לכל אחת ואחת.\n  ועונה, נ. ב. <strong>לדעתי צריך למחוק תיבת ועונה</strong>, כי לפי מה שכתב בהל' ד' אינו חייב אלא לפי מנין הנשים שיש לו, וא\"כ אינו נותן כראוי לכל אחת, ועוד דעיקר המקור הוא מהגמ' ביבמות דאיתא שם והוא דאית לי' למיזיינינהו</p>\n  \n  <p>In my opinion one must emend the Rambam to not include the word Onah, as he clearly states in Halacha 4 that one can marry more wives and reduce the amount of conjugal rights to each existing wife, also the Gemara states Yevamos 65a all he needs is enough food in order to marry more wives (i.e no problem of reducing conjugal rights)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maggid Mishna seems to have this emended version like the Even Haazel as he Says Rambam Paskens like Rovo (Yevamos 65a) that a woman cannot demand a divorce when a man marries another wife despite reducing conjugal rights, as long as he provides food*</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Note the Nimukei Yosef (and Ramach) argues with the Rambam:<br>\nזה לא נאמר אלא ביבמות דכיון דקי\"ל אשה שהקנו לו מן השמים צריכה בע\"כ להמתין אבל בשאר נשים חייב הוא לקיים מצות עונה עם כל אחת כאילו היא לבדה<br>\nThis rule of that one can reduce conjugal rights was was only said with a Yevama as she was aquired to him by G-d, so his existing wife cannot complain its his fault and has to now wait extra long between relations, but a normal wife among multiple wives has the conjugal rights as if she was the only wife (i.e one cannot reduce conjugal rights)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>How does this not contradict halacha 3, that he cannot take wives if it will reduce his food clothing or conjugal duties to the existing wives?</em></p>\n\n<p>Because the Rambam only listed conjugal duties along with the other spousal responsibilities since they still exist. He is clarifying in the next Halacha that they don't exist to the extent the other spousal responsibilities still do.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam is based on  the Gemorah Yevomos 65A which says</p>\n\n<p>רבא אמר נושא אדם כמה נשים והוא דאית ליה למיזיינינהו</p>\n\n<p>A person can marry many wives as long as he can support them all. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemorah mentions support but not conjugal responsibilities explicitly. (This inference is my own and  it is questionable)</p>\n\n<p>The Maaseh Rekach says that implicit in being able to marry a second wife is permission to somewhat diminish conjugal obligations. While it is possible for one husband to financially support many wives a person is not going to be able to multiply his conjugal activities by the number of wives he marries. Therefore if he can marry more than one wife he must also be allowed to diminish his conjugal obligations (but not abolish them)</p>\n\n\n",

R' Yehudah bar Chaviva said, \"Because it has in it five things: The mitzvah of Tzitzis, leaving Mitzraim, the yoke of Mitzvos, opinions of heretics, thoughts of sin, and thoughts of idolatry.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Um, that's six things, not five.</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought \"thoughts of sin\" and \"thoughts of idolatry\" were counted as one item, but the Gemara proceeds to note where in the passage each of these things are discussed, and each of them gets its own passuk.</p>\n\n<p>How, then, is this to be understood as five items?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This passage also appears in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalkut_Shimoni\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni</a>, and in that version there are indeed only five things. Number 4, \"opinions of heretics\" in your translation, does not appear. The supporting verse cited in the Talmud for it also does not appear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פרשת ציצית מפני מה קבעוה בק\"ש מפני שיש בה חמשה דברים מצות ציצית ויציאת מצרים ועול מצות והרהור עבירה והרהור אלילים בשלמא הני תלתא מפרשי אלא עבירה ואלילים מנלן דתניא אחרי לבבכם זה הרהור עבירה ואחרי עיניכם זה הרהור אלילים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This question was in fact asked by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharsha\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Samuel Eidels</a> in his commentary to the Talmud there. He first notes the parallel passage in the Yalkut Shimoni, but then offers a suggestion how we can even understand the Talmud's text as is. He suggests that Number 5 and Number 6, \"thoughts of sin\" and \"thoughts of idolatry\" in your translation, are essentially the same thing. The Talmud thus means that there are five <em>discrete</em> things:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מפני שיש בה ה' דברים כו'. קאמר ה' דברים וחשיב ששה ובגירסת ילקוט לא חשיב מינות ול\"ג דתניא אחרי לבבכם זה מינות וכה\"א אמר נבל וגו' ע\"ש והיינו מינות היינו הרהור ע\"ג ונראה ליישב גירסת כל הספרים דמינות היינו כופר במציאות כדמייתי אמר נבל בלבו אין אלהים והרהור ע\"ג היינו דמשתף שם שמים ודבר אחר וצריך לומר לפי זה דהרהור עבירה והרהור ע\"ג חשיב כחדא ודו\"ק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would also suggest, though I have no source for this, that there is no contradiction to begin with. The Talmud's question was why the parshah of <strong>tzitzit</strong> was included in Shema. The Talmud already knows that it contains the mitzvah of tzitzit, and it is seeking <em>additional</em> value in this parshah. The answer to that is that this parshah contains five <em>additional</em> things. Thus, the first thing in the list, tzitzit, is not part of the \"five things\".</p>\n\n\n",

The case of a private altar is one who offers a karban to Hashem outside the Beis HaMikdash – but it's still being offered to Hashem.

His wife was barren and had borne no children. An angel of the LORD appeared to the woman...The woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me; he looked like an angel of God, very frightening. I did not ask him where he was from, nor did he tell me his name...Manoah pleaded with the LORD. “Oh, my Lord!” he said, “please let the man of God that You sent come to us again, and let him instruct us how to act with the child that is to be born.”\n  God heeded Manoah’s plea, and the angel of God came...But the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “If you detain me, I shall not eat your food; and if you present a burnt offering, offer it to LORD.”—For Manoah did not know that he was an angel of the LORD...Manoah took the kid and the meal offering and offered them up on the rock to the LORD; and a marvelous thing happened while Manoah and his wife looked on. As the flames leaped up from the altar toward the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flames of the altar, while Manoah and his wife looked on; and they flung themselves on their faces to the ground. The angel of the LORD never appeared again to Manoah and his wife.—Manoah then realized that it had been an angel of the LORD. And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen a divine being.” Etc. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.13.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judges 13</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both Manoach and his wife's ability to see the angel as a divine being and Manoach's fear from the sight of the angel's divine form shows us that angels had a supernatural look to them that was even recognizable by simple people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>Genesis 32:4 explains that Jacob sent malachim to his brother Esau. Malachim in Hebrew means messengers, not angels. </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 32:23-33 tells the strange incident of Jacob wrestling with an angel. Expecting to encounter Esau the following day, he reportedly wrestled with a man until daybreak. During the battle, Jacob’s thigh is injured.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides felt that G-d does not need helpers. Instead, he equates angels with the natural forces that do G-d’s will such as the wind, snow, and rain. In his Guide of the Perplexed 3:42, Rambam writes that the events in Genesis 32:23-33 did not actually occur; “it was entirely a prophetic vision (or, a dream).”</p>\n\n<p>In short, angels and demons do not exist. G-d is all-powerful and needs no helpers. For G-d is not a Pasha surrounded by servants that carry out the Pasha's commands. G-d has no need for assistants. The term malakh (angels) are a metaphor for the forces of nature. If one wants to think of the existence of angels, think of the natural forces such as rain, snow, the laws of gravity, etc. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there no end to praying for a friend?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Talmud Berachot 12b says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַבָּה בַּר חִינָּנָא סָבָא מִשְּׁמֵיהּ דְּרַב: כֹּל\nשֶׁאֶפְשָׁר לוֹ לְבַקֵּשׁ רַחֲמִים עַל חֲבֵירוֹ וְאֵינוֹ מְבַקֵּשׁ —\nנִקְרָא ״חוֹטֵא״. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״גַּם אָנֹכִי חָלִילָה לִּי מֵחֲטֹא\nלַה׳ מֵחֲדֹל לְהִתְפַּלֵּל בַּעַדְכֶם״.</p>\n<p>And Rabba bar Ḥinnana Sava\nsaid in the name of Rav: Anyone who can ask for mercy on behalf of\nanother, and does not ask is called a sinner, as it is stated\nfollowing Samuel’s rebuke of the people: “As for me, far be it from me\nthat I should transgress against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,\nbut I will teach you the good and the right way” (I Samuel 12:23). Had\nSamuel refrained from prayer, he would have committed a sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to impose an obligation with no possible end.  I know many people, and \"the needs of your people are great\" (Berachot 29b).  Everyone needs prayer.  So can't I <strong>always</strong> ask for mercy on behalf of another?  Can I ever stop asking for mercy on behalf of those I know?</p>\n<p>If I am aware my friend has a particular need (he is sick, or needs to get married, or wants children, or wants a better living, or wants his prayers answered or any of a gazillion other things), does praying for them just once fulfill my obligation?  Once per day? Every tefilla?</p>\n\n\n",

And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord” (II Samuel 23:15–16). The Sages understood that David was not simply asking for water, but was using the term as a metaphor referring to Torah, and he was raising a halakhic dilemma. What is the dilemma that David is raising? Rava says that Rav Naḥman says: He was asking about the halakha with regard to a concealed article damaged by a fire. He wanted to know whether the halakha is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that one is liable to pay for such damage, or whether the halakha is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who hold that one is exempt from liability for damage by fire to concealed articles. And the Sages in Bethlehem answered him what they answered him. Rav Huna stated a different explanation of the verse: There were stacks of barley belonging to Jews in which the Philistines were hiding, and David wanted to burn down the stacks to kill the Philistines and save his own life. He raised the dilemma: What is the halakha? Is it permitted to save oneself by destroying the property of another? They sent the following answer to him: It is prohibited to save oneself by destroying the property of another. But you are king, and a king may breach the fence of an individual in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his action, i.e., the normal halakhot of damage do not apply to you since you are king. The Rabbis, and some say that it was Rabba bar Mari, give an alternative explanation of the dilemma and said: The stacks of barley belonged to Jews, and there were stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines. David needed barley to feed his animals. And David raised the following dilemma: What is the halakha? I know that I may take the lentils belonging to a gentile to feed my animals, but is it permitted to take a stack of barley belonging to a Jew, to place before one’s animal for it to consume, with the intent to pay the owner of the barley with the stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines? The Sages of Bethlehem sent the following reply to him: “If the wicked restore the pledge, give back that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die” (Ezekiel 33:15). This verse teaches that even though the robber repays the value of the stolen item, he is nevertheless considered to be wicked, and is described as such in the verse, and a commoner would not be allowed to act as you asked. But you are king, and a king may breach the fence of an individual in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his action.... Granted, according to the one who says that David asked his question because he wanted to burn the stacks, this is as it is written in the following verse with regard to David: “But he stood in the midst of the plot, and saved it, and slew the Philistines; and the Lord performed a great victory” (II Samuel 23:12). But according to the one who says that David’s question was asked with regard to exchanging the lentils for the barley, what is the meaning of the phrase: “And saved it”? The Rabbis answer that David saved it in that he did not permit them to exchange the value of the barley with the lentils.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosafos on the Gemara:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהו להציל עצמו בממון חבירו - איבעיא ליה אי חייב לשלם כשהציל עצמו מפני פקוח נפש:‏</p>\n<p>\"What is the halacha- Is it permitted to save oneself by destroying the property of another?\" He asked him if he is obligated to pay after saving his own life</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(All originals, and Gemara translation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Kamma.60b.18?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Bava_Kamma.60b.18.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>, Tosafos translation is my own.)</p>\n<p>The Tosafos seems to imply that one can save his life with another's property, but (according to what the Gemara rules) must pay it back, but a king need not pay back. Yet we see that David not only decided to forgo his rights of not paying the owner back, he actually actively stops his soldiers from burning the field down- something even a commoner is allowed to do- thereby saving the field and endangering his own life!</p>\n<p>So why, according to Tosafos, did David stop his soldiers from burning the field down, when even a commoner would be allowed to burn it down in this case?</p>\n\n\n",

Judaism achieves a delicate balance between individual rights and community rights.  Here are two examples among many.</p>\n\n<p>(1) To emphasize individual rights, the Torah asserts a person’s right to have enjoyed life before dying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Before going to war] the officers shall speak to the people, saying, \n  If one of you has built a new house, and has not yet dedicated it, let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicates it.\n  And if one of you has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it, let him also go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eats of it.\n  And if one of you has betrothed a wife, and has not yet married her, let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man marries her. [Deuteronomy 20:5-7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(2) And to assert community rights, Joshua laid down restrictions on land ownership for the sake of the community, including [Baba Kama 80b-81a]:</p>\n\n<p>-The community has the right to benefit from a new water source, even if discovered in private land.</p>\n\n<p>-The community has the right to fish in Lake Kinneret, as long as it does not interfere with navigation.</p>\n\n<p>-The community has the right of pasture in private land that is unfarmed.</p>\n\n<p>-The community has the right of free passage on private land, including relieving oneself.</p>\n\n<p>-Everyone has the right to be buried where he dies, even if on private \nland. </p>\n\n<p>(3) If anything, there is a slight tilt towards the individual:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever destroys one life is considered as if he destroyed an entire world; and whoever saves one life is considered as if he saved an entire world… [Sanhedrin Y 4:1 (22a)]  So everyone must say: The world was created for my sake.

Rambam, whose opinion was relied upon to re-establish semikha, also holds that whenever a Sanhedrin exists, new months must be established through testimony (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sanctification_of_the_New_Month.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilkhos Kiddush HaChodesh 5:2</a>).

They do this on Rosh Chodesh according to the fixed calendar, which is often before the new moon can be seen.</p>\n\n<p>(This is what comes out from the Ramban's long calculations in Hilchos Kidush Hachosesh, which I was working out last year. I also was observing the moon then. Many times the moon was just viable at the very end of Rosh Chodesh. Right now as it happens the moon should be visible the night before Rosh Chodesh.)</p>\n\n<p>I feel that I must point out that Rav Halberstam zt\"l was not \"selected by universal consensus to re-establish the line of semicha.\" It was agreed by Rav Elyashiv zt\"l and Rav Ovadiah zt\"l that he was fitting for semicha.

You may note that the vocalization is not always the same. Most of the time you see the name יהו-ה in a siddur, it is vocalized as ״יְהוָה״ This tells you that this name is supposed to be pronounced with those vowels as \"Adonai.\" The vowels here correspond to the vowels in the word ״אֲדוֹנָי״ (note that chataf-patach is technically a type of shva). In other cases, you might see the name vocalized as ״יֱהוִה״. This corresponds to the name \"אֱלֹהִים\" and should be pronounced as such.</p>\n\n<p>For example, \"אֲדֹנָ֤י יֱהוִה֙\" in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 15:2</a> is pronounced \"Adonai Elohim\".</p>\n\n<p>The following image shows the connection visually (<a href=\"https://tikkunolam.eu/uncategorized/tetragrammaton/?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DATUO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DATUO.png\" alt=\"God's name vocalizations\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Ephrathites, such as David both from Ephraim as Yehudah?",
    "content": "# Ephrathites, such as David both from Ephraim as Yehudah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Looking at the words Ephrathite and Ephraimite (אפרתי) they have the exact same spelling. From the website doitinhebrew.com the dictionary even said: ‘Ephraimite; inhabitant of Ephrat(ah).’</p>\n\n<p>This reminded me of Beit Lechem the homeground or ancestral home of both Elimelech and Naomi, who are called Ephratites in the book of Ruth (1:2). Which could be derived from the fact that Boaz is identified as a member of Elimelech his family (1:2), a near kinsmen redeemer for Naomi (2:2, 3:12), and a direct descandant of Yehudah (4:18-20). Boaz also identifies Elimelech as ‘a brother’ when he speaks with the nearest kinsmen redeemer (4:3). </p>\n\n<p>So here’s the thing: we know that because of a famine they have to leave Beit Lechem and that when Elimelech and the two sons of Naomi have passed away that she returns with her daughter-in-law Ruth. From the story it becomes clear that  Naomi, an Ephraimite, owned ancestral land in Beit Lechem which she decided to sell in an attempt to secure a life partner for Ruth in the hope of raising up a son in the name of Ruth’s widow and Naomi’s deceased son, Mahlon. Because Naomi’s son Mahlon was the rightful heir to her ancestral land, Mahlon’s widow, Ruth, came with the land and the man who purchased the land would be required to fulfill the levirate  marriage rites and raise up a son to Mahlon, which would become the heir of the land.</p>\n\n<p>Well, Boaz was that man, and he and Ruth got married, Ruth gave birth to Obed, the father of Yishai, who became the father of David HaMelech. Obed is said to be the grandson of Naomi (for clear reasons), and Ruth would be the great-grand-mother of David. </p>\n\n<p>So David could be seen as a Ephratite of Beit Lechem Yehudah. </p>\n\n<p>If Elimelech and Naomi hadn’t had an ancestral right to the land in Beit Lechem, Boaz wouldn’t had the responsibility to fulfill the levirate marriage role with Ruth because the land was the rightful inheritance of Mahlon. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that Ephrat(ah) isn’t listed as one of the cities of Yehudah, coupled with the fact Elimelech and Naomi are called Ephratites, which could mean the same as Ephraimites, and their ancestral right to land in Beit-Lechem, it may be concluded that this city in the territory of Yehudah was quite different from all other cities in this area. Why? Because it could be that many people in this city had ancestral ties to two tribes, Ephraim and Yehudah. </p>\n\n<p>Because Boaz is a member of Elimelech’s family, could it be he’s also a Ephraimite living in Yehudah?! Of course Boaz is also from the lineage of Yehudah as stated in the end of the book of Ruth. </p>\n\n<p>So here’s my question: could it be that David is descended from both Ephraim as well as Yehudah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the question you suggest that Ephrat is so named because of an association with Ephraim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Ephrat(ah) isn’t listed aso e of the cities of Yehudah, coupled with the fact Elimelech and Naomi are called Ephratites, which could mean the same as Ephraimites, and their ancestral right to land in Beit-Lechem, it may be concluded that this city in the territory of Yehudah was quite different from all other cities in this area. Why? Because it could be that many people in this city had ancestral ties to two tribes, Ephraim and Yehudah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, we find the name Ephrat used for this city well before the settlement of the Land, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.35.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 35:16</a> :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּסְעוּ֙ מִבֵּ֣ית אֵ֔ל וַֽיְהִי־ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת־הָאָ֖רֶץ לָב֣וֹא אֶפְרָ֑תָה וַתֵּ֥לֶד רָחֵ֖ל וַתְּקַ֥שׁ בְּלִדְתָּֽהּ׃</p>\n<p>They set out from Bethel; but when they were still some distance short of Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.48.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 48:7</a> Ephrat is identified with Bethlehem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַאֲנִ֣י ׀ בְּבֹאִ֣י מִפַּדָּ֗ן מֵ֩תָה֩ עָלַ֨י רָחֵ֜ל בְּאֶ֤רֶץ כְּנַ֙עַן֙ בַּדֶּ֔רֶךְ בְּע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת־אֶ֖רֶץ לָבֹ֣א אֶפְרָ֑תָה וָאֶקְבְּרֶ֤הָ שָּׁם֙ בְּדֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔ת הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם׃</p>\n<p>I [do this because], when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, while I was journeying in the land of Canaan, when still some distance short of Ephrath; and I buried her there on the road to Ephrath”—now Bethlehem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that Ephrat is the earlier name, and therefore it should not be associated with any local lineage to Ephraim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ruth_Rabbah.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruth Rabbah 2:5</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Ephrathites\": Rabbi Joshua son of Levi says: \"Royals (palatini)\", and Rabbi the son of Rabbi Nechemiah says: \"Nobles (eugenistai)\". Another interpretation: \"Ephrathites\": Rabbi Pinchas said: \"Ephraim was crowned with the whole crown from Jacob our father at the time he was departing (petirato) from the world. He said to him: \"Ephraim, head of the tribe, head of the yeshivah, the ascended and the praised of my sons will be called by your name: \"son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite (1 Samuel 1:1)\". \"Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite (1 Kings 11:26)\". \"David was the son of a certain Ephrathite (1 Samuel 17:12)\". \"Mahlon and Chilion—Ephrathites\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can see that the word Ephrati can be understood in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A nobleman or a member of royalty.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A tribal leader or Rosh Yeshiva.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Per the first understanding, the connection between Ephraim and the word Ephrati is coincidental (though fits in well with different psukim and Midrashim about the pride of Ephraim, for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Metzudat_David_on_Isaiah.28.3.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=en&with=Isaiah&lang2=en&p3=Isaiah.28.3&lang3=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.48.4?vhe=Pirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>). Arguably, according to this interpretation, Ephrati probably came before the name Ephraim (as @simyou pointed out, Ephratah was part of Beit Lechem's name even before the birth of Ephraim). In fact, in a different <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Vayikra_Rabbah.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash</a>, Ephraim <em>himself</em> is called a \"palatini\" or an \"avginos\", two of the meanings of Ephrati.</p>\n<p>Per the second understanding, \"Ephrati\" comes from Ephraim but it is made clear that that does not mean that everyone who is called \"Ephrati\" is a descendant of Ephraim, rather, it is part of the blessing of Yaakov to his grandson that in his honor, important people will be named after him. One of the examples brought in this part of the midrash is King David himself.</p>\n<p>Therefore, while there is some connection between the two words, that does not mean that every person that was called an Ephrati is a descendant of Ephraim. At best, they are, in some sense, spiritual descendants of Ephraim, honoring his memory by carrying a title similar to his name.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Samuel 17.12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons; and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among men.</p>\n<p>The Hebrew word used is אפרתי. This word appears only 5 times in the whole Bible.</p>\n<p>Judges 12.5 And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said: ‘Let me go over,’ the men of Gilead said unto him: ‘Art thou an Ephraimite?’ If he said: ‘Nay’;</p>\n<p>Samuel 1.1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</p>\n<p>Kings 1.11.26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</p>\n<p>Ruth 1.2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there.</p>\n<p>As you can see in all these examples אפרתי means Ephraimites. For some reason Ephraimites moved to Bet Lehem. It was maybe because their mother Rachel was buried there.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why continue to omit the Ten Commandments in Jewish liturgy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Ten Commandments were included in the Temple service, then were removed.  The Talmud says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: [The Sages] wished to recite [the Ten Commandments with the Shema] ... but soon abolished them because of the arguments of the minim [heretics], [that the Ten Commandments were the only valid part of the Torah.] ... [Later still,] Rabbah bar bar Chanah sought to reinstitute [the recitation of the Ten Commandments] in Sura [a great academy in Babylon], but Rav Chisda said to him:  They already abolished their recitation because of the arguments of the minim. [Even later,] Amemar sought to reinstitute [the recitation of the Ten Commandments] in Nehardea, but Rav Ashi said to him, They already abolished their recitation because of the arguments of the minim. [Berachot 12a; also in Mishna 5:1 in Tamid 32b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Ten Commandments were left out of the service for fear that the average passer-by (who, as we know, always has the IQ of a cauliflower) would hear them and conclude that they are the only commandments Jews need to observe.</p>\n\n<p>Now that our IQ has risen, do we still need to keep the Ten Commandments out of the liturgy?  Should we bring them back?  If a congregation did, would they be violating halacha?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added note</strong>:  We are talking ONLY about inclusion in services.  There are many opinions that reciting them after services is OK.  (But \"after\" and \"during\" are exercises in semantics.)  -The Baal Ha-Turim (14th-century Spain): People should say them privately. -Rabbi Joseph Karo (16th-century Israel, Shulchan Arukh): The ban only applies to public recitation during service.  They may be said privately after the service. They are included for that purpose in most prayerbooks.  -Rabbi Moshe Isserles (16th-century Poland): One may recite them any time, but not in public. -Jews in Fostat, near Cairo, Egypt, in 10th-12th centuries, read the Ten Commandments after services.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Similar  questions are frequently asked about many Gezioros which Chazal  made that the given reason  no longer seems relevant today,</p>\n\n<p>The unanimous consensus is that the original Gezirah enactment remains in place for two reasons.</p>\n\n<p>(1)The Rashba and other Rishonim (Forgot where) say that even when Chazal explicitly give a reason for a Gezira, the reason given is not necessarily the <strong>only</strong> reason.

For simplicity, let us ignore any sins committed during gladiator performances.</p>\n\n<p>If not, was it simply because he left fewer than two surviving kosher witnesses?</p>\n\n<p>Was the Sanhedrin's \"secular authority\" not invoked because he was clearly of no future danger?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In general, acts of theft and violence are exonerated by monetary payments, as Jewish courts practiced restorative justice rather than retributive justice.  So there would have been no flogging (<em>malkos</em>), imprisonment, or capital punishment incurred for his crimes.  Even monetary fines (e.g. <em>keifel</em>) can only be payed if there are witnesses to the act, as מודה בקנס פטור, so he would be exempt from those as well.</p>\n\n<p>As for repaying the people he robbed, or paying restitution for those he harmed, that is an integral part of the <em>teshuva</em> process.  So although the <em>Gemara</em> doesn't mention it, I would assume R' Shimon did make efforts to repay what and whom he could, and applied the rule for גנב ולא יודע את מי גנב for the rest.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Firstly the story took place hundreds of years after Sanhedrin stopped judging capital  cases.They stopped doing so even before they disbanded.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, even had Sanhedrin been around and even assuming Reish Lakish was guilty of murder (do you have a source that he was? the Gemorah does mention him killing people but they were murderers who were going to kill him )he would have needed two kosher witnesses AND  a warning a few seconds before he committed the act of murder that he was doing a capital. offense. It's safe to assume he didn't meet that criterion. He would have had to meet the same criteria for lashes. Furthermore, theft is not a crime that one receives lashes for.</p>\n\n<p>One can question if he paid back what he stole. There is no reason to assume he didn't but  <strong>if</strong> he didn't it may inter alia be because of the Gemorah which says that if a thief is looking to do Teshuva we don't accept the return of his stolen items out of concern that he may decide against doing Teshuva due to the difficulty involved. There are also other reasons why he may not have been halachicly obligated to pay back.</p>\n\n<p>As far as why Sanhedrin didn't use their (nonexistent at the time) secular authority, perhaps that question could be asked about before he did Teshuva but afterward? Sanhedrin was not in the business of using extrajudicial powers to kill people who clearly had done Teshuva. </p>\n\n<p>Decades before they disbanded they stopped judging capital cases because there were too many people who halachicly <strong>deserved</strong> the death penalty. They certainly weren't giving the  death penalty to someone who halachicly  <em>didn't</em> deserve it  and had clearly done Teshuva</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Who said Resh Lakish wasn't punished?  But he was a great scholar, which puts him in a different category.  As he himself said (and it was apparently accepted):  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Resh Lakish said: If a Torah scholar sins, he is not ostracized at all in public, as it is stated: “Therefore, shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night” (Hosea 4:5). This is explained to mean: If a prophet or any other important person sins, his offense should be concealed like the night and not punished in public. [Moed Katan 17a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, this shift of one day is not always enough to ensure that ovulation occurs after immersion. </p>\n\n<p>I've heard of a leniency that involves counting 4 (or 5) days of the period starting from the last intercourse before the period began, rather than from the actual period onset. However, I was told \"we don't rely on this.\" Is this leniency acceptable to some poskim? Are there other leniencies in this situation? </p>\n\n<p>(I am aware that some women take hormones to delay ovulation in this circumstance, but that is not an option for everyone.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/orthodox-infertility-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Jachter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many Halachic authorities permit an early Hefseik Taharah (before five days have passed since the bleeding began) in such circumstances. These authorities include Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (reported by Rav Yosef Adler), Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe Y.D. 4:17:22), and Rav Ovadia Yosef (Taharat HaBayit 2:416). These authorities believe that the custom to wait five days (or four days for Sephardim according to Rav Ovadia Yosef) from the start of the bleeding before beginning to count the seven clean days may be waived (under certain conditions) in order to fulfill the Mitzvah of Peru URevu. We treat a custom with significantly less stringency than a rabbinical prohibition.  This approach helps solve the problem in some cases.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many Poskim also permit artificial insemination using the husband's genetic material before the wife has immersed in the Mikvah. These authorities include Rav Ovadia Yosef (Taharat HaBayit 1:29), Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe Even Haezer 2:18), and Rav Zvi Pesach Frank (an oral tradition reported by Rav Ovadia Yosef ibid). Rav Ovadia and Rav Moshe write that the child will not bear the stigma of a Ben Niddah if it is conceived in this manner. It is important to note that many Poskim strongly urge that this process be performed under strict rabbinical supervision to insure that no tampering or mistakes are made in the process.</p>\n  \n  <p>Another option might be for an especially competent doctor to prescribe medicine that will adjust her cycle to avoid this problem. Care must be taken to insure that this process does not impinge on the wife's health.</p>\n  \n  <p>Postscript - Machon Puah</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover, it is very important to bring to the community's attention a most wonderful resource for the Jewish People throughout the world. Machon Puah in Jerusalem provides Halachic guidance to couples that are experiencing difficulties conceiving a child.  They employ rabbis who are available full-time to respond in a variety of languages to questions regarding the interface of Halacha and fertility. Moreover, they are at the forefront of offering rabbinical supervision of fertility procedures. It is highly worthwhile for rabbis and laypeople to consult with Machon Puah in case of need.  For more information one may visit their website at www.puah.org.il (click “English” for the English section of the website).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, a postscript from <a href=\"https://www.yoatzot.org/fertility/584/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nishmat</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both halacha and medicine are case-based, and treatments and rulings reflect the nuances of each individual situation. Therefore, in practice, we strongly recommend that every couple affected by halachic infertility consult directly with a rabbi and a physician who have expertise in this field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the gemara seem to care more about erasing God's name than getting the correct ruling for a sotah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the mishna on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.7a.16?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 7a</a> , we learn that the beis din intimidates the sotah in order to try to get her to admit to wrongdoing and avoid drinking the sotah water. The gemara on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.7b.4?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7b</a> asks why our mishna doesn't mention a fact that we learn from a beraisa: that the beis din also <em>encourages</em> her to drink the water if she's innocent. This difficulty is resolved by saying that the latter only happens <em>after</em> the name of God is erased in the water and our mishna is talking about <em>before</em> that happens.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to come out from this that before the name is erased, the beis din does not encourage her to drink the water if she's innocent. They only intimidate her and try to get her to admit to wrongdoing. So it seems that the sotah falsely admitting under coercion is considered a better outcome than going through the process and finding her innocent by drinking the water, even though it means that she becomes forbidden to her husband and loses her kesubah. Obviously this is troubling, but it also seems to undermine the entire point of the mitzvah of sotah. If erasing God's name is such a bad thing that we prefer to forbid the woman to her husband and have her lose her kesubah over erasing the name and giving her a chance at vindication, why does the mitzvah of sotah exist at all? Why not just have that be the punishment for a sotah and leave it at that?</p>\n\n<p>Even if it's true that the vast majority of sotahs are guilty, they know the truth. So why couldn't the beis din do two things before erasing the name:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Intimidate her and try to convince her to admit guilt if she's guilty.</p></li>\n<li><p>Assure her that if she's innocent the water will not hurt her.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I really can't see how you got this from the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>Read the words on the \"intimidating\" speech carefully, it's not intimidation.\nWe just tell her the sometimes people do mistakes, even great people, so she will feel more comfortable to admit if guilty (among other actions we do, see Mishna 1:6, 3:3. ).\nWe don't describe the horrible effect of the water on a guilty women, why don't we do it?  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO INTIMIDATE AN INNOCENT WOMEN</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Putting a relaxing speech here is unneeded.</p>\n\n<p>We put the relaxing speech before she drink so innocent women will not admit falsely when she see the cursed water point-blank.</p>\n\n\n",

'If You see,' good, and if not, 'You will see' – I will go and seclude myself before my husband Elkanah, and since I'm secluded they will have me drink the Sotah waters, and You will not make Your Torah a forgery, as it says, 'She will be clean and will bear children.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(This story also appears very similarly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesikta_Rabbati.43.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta Rabbasi §43</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The way Chanah phrases her claim seems to indicate that she's not planning on letting Elkanah know what she's planning and why; the idea is simply that Elkanah will warn her and have her drink.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose Chanah were to tell Elkanah ahead of time that she plans to seclude herself and not sin such that she will drink and receive the berachos of the Sotah waters. If Elkanah were to warn her, knowing her plan and knowing that she's not sinning, would they still have her drink?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer lies within Alex's comment above. The 'warning' given by a husband to his wife not to be secluded is more than lip service. The Torah explicitly describes it as a result of 'a spirit of kinah (jealousy or zeal).' However, if the husband gives this warning and claims that he never really meant it, he will not be believed (devarim shebelev - see Kiddushin 49b). If, on the other hand, he announces publicly beforehand that he doesn't really mean to give this kind of 'warning', she certainly would not drink. This is what Chazal call giving a \"moda'ah\" to invalidate a subsequent action (see for example Bava Basra 40a).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As pointed out by double AA, there is an issur yichud even is she is planning not to sin in the extreme sense. And it isn't possible to know what will happen behind closed doors. So let's say that Elkana knows her plan. He will still tell her not to be secluded with the man, and when she does against his consent he will not know if the most inappropriate happened. (Remember, while Chana is alive we can't know that she is a historic tzadekes.) So I don't think her reveling the plan would prevent it from working.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Information of Kiddushin 41a\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom. I have a doubt that assails me.</p>\n<p>In this text from Talmud (b.Kiddushin 41a) the marriage of a minor is not prohibited but not recommended, in contrast to laws that allow it (b.Sanhedrin 54b, 55a-55b; b.Yebamoth 57b-60b etc) and he says in the name of Rab Judah:</p>\n<p>דאמר רב יהודה אמר רב: אסור לאדם שיקדש את בתו כשהיא קטנה, עד שתגדל ותאמר בפלוני אני רוצה. Rab Judah said in Rab's name: One may not give his daughter in betrothal when a minor, [but must wait] until she grows up and says: “I want So-and-so”.</p>\n<p>It refers to an orphaned minor in view of the possibility of \"me'un\" or common minor? This is primarily my question.</p>\n<p>Because.... Adin Steinsaltz says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ritva cites another explanation, according to which the statement in Kiddushin refers to a minor girl who has a father, whereas the statements in our Gemara refers to an orphan girl.» (Adin Steinsaltz, The Talmud: The Steinsaltz edition: A reference guide, Random House, New York 1989, p. 242)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It can be deduced that B. Kiddushin 41a does not concern at all the engagement of any minor daughter but of a fatherless girl? In fact, only a fatherless girl can escape an unwanted marriage (b.Yebamoth 107b).</p>\n<p>Maybe (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.41a.8?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.41a.8.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot, Kiddushin 41a, ad loc. “Asur le-adam”</a>) \"It is still our habit to promise our minor daughters\". Ritva and also Maimonides, Ishut 11,12-19 have misunderstood B. Kiddushin 41b?</p>\n<p>The fundamental thing is that, in fact, it is allowed for a father to engage an underage daughter can be found in the same treatise precisely in Kiddushin 2a-3b.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_Urbach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ephraim Urbach</a> (1912-1991) illustrious Jewish scholar of Judaism known above all for his reference works on rabbinic thought, the sages, and for research on Tosafot: «The law that a man has the right to give his minor daughter in marriage (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kiddushin.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 2:1</a>) is deduced from the Torah, as it is written, “I gave this man my daughter to wife” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 22,16</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.3b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TB Kiddushin 3b</a>). It seems, however, that if a person died and left a minor daughter, it was an accepted custom that her mother or brothers could give her in marriage with or without her consent.» (Efraim Elimelech Urbach, The Halakhah, its sources and development, Massada Publishing, Jerusalem 1986, p. 35)</p>\n<p>Statements that do not coincide with Rab's judgment at all. Judah confirms that what sentenced in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.41a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">b.Kiddushin 41a</a> is only an aggadic and not halachic declaration.</p>\n<p>So, the question what Steinsaltz says about Kiddushin is true? I rephrase the question, does Kiddushin 41b speak of an orphan and therefore Maimonides had an oversight to make \"me'un\" universal?</p>\n<p>Shalom.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There's no contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>A father has the \"right\" to marry off his minor daughter, as in if he does it, she's married.</p>\n\n<p>Despite that, he's not allowed to do it unless she's old enough to agree and actually agrees.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, you're not allowed to do various things on Shabbat, but if you do, you've accomplished them.  This is obviously true for physical behaviors (the light switch doesn't stop working just because you're not allowed to use it), but it's also true for various legal things.  You're not allowed to get married on Shabbat, but if you do it anyway, it still works.</p>\n\n<p>The mother and brothers have a more limited, Rabbinic ability: they can marry her off, but she can get out of it through mi'un at any point until she grows up.</p>\n\n\n",

[etc].</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_7.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>Given that the above quote is but one step in a lengthy discussion, and the answer doesn't really make so much sense out of context, perhaps a little more explanation is in order. At this point the Talmud was explaining why the <em>tanna</em> would think that the verse that proscribes lighting fires on Shabbat is necessary to tell us that execution does not override Shabbat. The reasoning is that we could have argued that execution overrides Shabbat via a <em>kal vachomer</em> – if execution overrides temple service and temple service overrides Shabbat then execution should surely override Shabbat. The response to such an argument is that <em>meit mitzvah</em> also overrides temple service yet does not override Shabbat, despite having the same <em>kal vachomer</em>. At this point the above quote comes in to say that maybe in fact <em>meit mitzvah</em> should override Shabbat based on this very <em>kal vachomer</em> (and therefore so would execution). The response to that is that the verse explicitly proscribes lighting a fire.</p>\n\n<p>As explained by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yom Tov Asevili</a> in his commentary there, the point is that if the verse explicitly precludes execution overriding Shabbat even though it has the <em>kal vachomer</em> of superseding temple service which itself supersedes Shabbat, then obviously the <em>kal vachomer</em> is not valid. As such the same <em>kal vachomer</em> applied to <em>meit mitzvah</em> would necessarily be invalid as well.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פי' ואשמועינן קרא דלא נעביד ההוא ק\"ו ברציחה לדחות שבת ומינה שמעינן נמי לקבורת מת מצוה שלא תדחה שבת בק\"ו דהא ההוא ק\"ו הא איכא למפרך ביה מרציחה שיש בה אותו ק\"ו עצמו ואינו דוחה שבת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As Bible students will recall, the prophet Samuel executed King Agag according to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Sam%2015%3A7-9&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Sam 15:7-9</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, King Saul had correctly remembered \"what Amalek did to the Israelites\" when he destroyed the Amalekites and their possessions. However, he FORGOT what Amalek did to the Israelites because he spared the life of King Agag and preserved much animal booty in contradiction to the mandate given by God through the prophet Samuel. (Generally speaking, Saul \"remembered” the positive commands, but specifically he \"forgot\" the negative command.) King Agag's soon-to-be-conceived son was to be the very Amalekite who administered the <em>coup de grace</em> to King Saul at his assisted suicide.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.wendag.com/philo/Philo65.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Book of Biblical Antiquities</em> 65:1-5</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Philo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pseudo-Philo</a>, we read the following -</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>And the Philistines fought against Israel. And Saul went out to battle. And Israel fled before the Philistines: and when Saul saw that the battle waxed hard exceedingly, he said in his heart: Wherefore strengthenest thou thyself to live, seeing, Samuel hath proclaimed death unto thee and to thy sons?</li>\n  <li>And Saul said to him that bare his armour: Take thy sword and slay me before the Philistines come and abuse me. And he that bare his armour would not lay hands upon him.</li>\n  <li>And he himself bowed upon his sword, and he could not die. And he looked behind him and saw a man running and called unto him and said: Take my sword and slay me. For my life is yet in me.</li>\n  <li>And he came to slay him. And Saul said unto him: Before thou kill me, tell me, who art thou? <strong><em>And he said unto him: I am Edab, the son of Agag king of the Amalechites. And Saul said: Behold, now the words of Samuel are come upon me even as he said: He that shall be born of Agag shall be an offence unto thee.</em></strong> (emphasis added)</li>\n  <li>But go thou and say unto David: I have slain thine enemy. And thou shalt say unto him: Thus saith Saul: Be not mindful of my hatred, neither of mine unrighteousness. . . .</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Earlier in the narrative in <a href=\"https://www.wendag.com/philo/Philo58.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Book of Biblical Antiquities</em> 58:3-4</a> we read the following -</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>And God said unto Samuel: Hast thou seen how the king is corrupted with money even in a moment, and hath saved alive Agag king of Amalech and his wife?

(emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, the narrative in the preceding paragraphs may explain why Rambam had listed the distinct commandments as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Destroy the remnant of Amalek</em></strong> (Positive #189) </li>\n<li><strong><em>Remember what Amalek did</em></strong> (Positive #188) </li>\n<li><strong><em>Don't forget what he did</em></strong> (Negative #59)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Note that there are three <em>mitzvos</em> according to the <strong>Rambam</strong> that have to do with Amalek.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Destroy the remnant of Amalek (Positive #189)</li>\n<li>Remember what Amalek did (Positive #188)</li>\n<li>Don't forget what he did (Negative #59)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <strong>Ramban</strong> agrees. The <strong>Semag</strong> also counts these three (Asin 115, 116, Lavin 226).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rav Yerucham Fishel Perlow</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Commentary_on_Sefer_Hamitzvot_of_Rasag%2C_Positive_Commandments.59.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">points out</a> that <strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong> only explicitly counted #1. You're asking why there's a need for <em>both</em> #2 and #3, but <strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong> left <em>both</em> of those out. He also points out that the <strong>Bahag</strong> also only counted #1. He explains that the <strong>Bahag</strong> and the others who followed him understood that remembering what Amalek did and not forgetting are all included in the <em>mitzvah</em> to eradicate the remnant of Amalek. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דענין הזכירה הוא לזכור החובה למחות זרעו וכל אשר לו. וכן הוא בפסיקתא רבתי (פי\"ב) הוו זכורים לו למחות את שמו מן העולם. זכור את אשר עשה לך עמלק תמחה את זכר עמלק עיי\"ש.</p>\n  \n  <p>The point of remembering is to remember the obligation to wipe out his descendants and all that is his. This is also in Pesikta Rabbasi (Chapter  12): \"Remember him to wipe out his name from the world.  Remember what Amalek did to you; wipe out the memory of Amalek\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's one thing to include remembering in the <em>mitzvah</em> or eradicating, but why leave out the negative <em>mitzvah</em> against forgetting? To answer this, <strong>Rav Perlow</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Commentary_on_Sefer_Hamitzvot_of_Rasag%2C_Positive_Commandments.59.30?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brings</a> the opinion of <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong> (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/32671\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Yesod Morah</strong></a> <em>Sha'ar Sheni</em>), who asks like you, that there's no reason to count both remembering and not forgetting. The not forgetting is just a way to strengthen the obligation to remember. He writes similarly in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Deuteronomy.25.19.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary</a> to that verse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rav Perlow</strong> explains that it must be that the <strong>Rambam</strong>, <strong>Ramban</strong>, etc. disagree. He brings the <strong>Ramban</strong>'s opinion (<strong>Kiddushin</strong> 34a) that the positive <em>mitzvah</em> of building a fence on one's roof is the primary <em>mitzvah</em>, and the negative <em>mitzvah</em> of avoiding spilled blood on your property is secondary. Nevertheless, it's explicit in <strong>Sifrei Devarim</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.229.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">229</a>) that they're two <em>mitzvos</em>, even though the negative <em>mitzvah</em> merely strengthens the positive one.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems to be a dispute when the negative <em>mitzvah</em> is merely to strengthen the positive <em>mitzvah</em>, if they're both to be counted. You understand like the <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong>, whereas the <strong>Rambam</strong> <em>et. al.</em> see it differently. We see many other examples of this, one of which is the building of a fence on one's roof, as mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, <strong>Rav Perlow</strong>, for unrelated reasons, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Commentary_on_Sefer_Hamitzvot_of_Rasag%2C_Positive_Commandments.59.31?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wants to suggest</a> that <strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong> also counts a separate <em>mitzvah</em> to remember what Amalek did, and includes it in the <em>mitzvah</em> to read the <em>megillah</em> on Purim. Again, for unrelated reasons, <strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong> doesn't count the negative <em>mitzvah</em> against forgetting (<strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong> almost always only counts one <em>mitzvah</em> when there is a positive and negative version, and picks the one that's more inclusive). This would make him similar to <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong>, albeit for slightly reasons.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer is in the Sifre Parashat Bechukotay. I will quote it from the Sefer Hachinuch Mitsva 603, who follows the Rambam count of Mitsvot (Asim 189, Lavim 59). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מדיני המצוה. מה שאמרו זכרונם לברכה (מגילה יח, א) שחיוב זכירה זו היא בלב ובפה (עי' מצוה של), וכן הוא בספרי (ריש פ' בחוקותי), זכור את אשר עשה וגו' יכול בלבבך? כשהוא אומר לא תשכח הרי שכחת הלב אמורה, הא מה אני מקים זכור? שתהא שונה בפיך, עד כאן בספרי. כדי שלא ישכח הדבר, פן תחלש איבתו ותחסר מהלבבות באורך הזמנים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The redundancy of \"remember\" and \"don't forget\" leads the Sifre to conclude that to remember is \"by mouth\", since \"don't forget\" regards the heath, the memory. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>To not forget is in the hearth.</p></li>\n<li><p>to remember it by speaching. The periodicity of the remembering is not specified. Some customs are linked to this mitsva as the reading of Parashat Zachor Shabbat before Purim.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Minchat Chinuch writes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה אם שכח עובר בעשה ובל\"ת רק זכר בלב ולא בפה אינו עובר על הלאו רק לא קיים העשה ואם זכר לא עבר ומקיים מ\"ע גם כן ופשוט</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>If he forgets, he cancels the Lav and the Ase.</p></li>\n<li><p>If he remembers, by memory and doesn't speak, he cancels the Ase. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who exactly is the \"kedesha\" according to Rambam's interpretation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian noahide.</p>\n\n<p>My question expresses a purely intellectual curiosity, concerning the Jews and not the Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot understand what is the exact definition of \"kedesha\" by Rambam , as it seems to me that this great master gives two different definitions of this status, not easily reconciled with each other</p>\n\n<p>In Sefer Hamitzvot, <em>kedesha</em> appears defined as any unmarried woman who has relations with a man:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The 355th prohibition is that we are forbidden from having \n  relations with a woman without [giving her] a Kesubah and acquiring\n  her (Kiddushin). The source of this commandment is G d's statement\n  (exalted be He),” \"There shall not be a kedesha among the daughters of\n  Israel”. This same commandment is repeated, but using a different\n  expression, in G d's statement (exalted be He),” You shall not defile\n  your daughter by making her a harlot”. The Sifra says, \" 'You shall\n  not defile your daughter' — this command is directed towards a man who\n  hands over his unmarried daughter for sexual intercourses without\n  marriage, as well as a girl who herself has relations\n  without marriage.\" (……….) This prohibition, i.e. the prohibition of\n  [having relations with] an unmarried woman, is punishable by\n  lashes.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Mishneh Torah however, it seems to me that Rambam defines kedesha not generically as an unmarried woman who has relations with a man, but more limited in terms of a sexually promiscuous unmarried woman, i.e. an unmarried woman   available to have sex with more men in the same period. In this sense, the two steps below seem to be oriented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Hilchot Ishut 1:4</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>\"Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the\n  marketplace, and he and she desired, he could give her  payment,\n  engage in relations with her wherever they desired, and then  depart.\n  Such a woman is referred to as a kedesha When the Torah was  given,\n  [relations with] a kedesha became forbidden, as [Deuteronomy  23:18]\n  states: \"There shall not be a kedesha among the daughters of Israel”. Therefore, a person who has relations with a woman  “leshem zenut”, without kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because he had relations with a kedesha.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Hilchot Naarah Betulah 2:17</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I maintain that [the intent of] the Torah's statement [Leviticus\n  19:29], “),” You shall not defile your daughter by making her a\n  harlot”, is that a father should not say: \"Since the obligation of the\n  Torah for a seducer or a rapist was solely that he should give the\n  father money, I will hire my virgin daughter to someone to have\n  relations with her for whatever price I desire, or I will allow him to\n  have relations for her without charge. For a man has the right to\n  forgo monetary rights to him to any person he desires.\" To counter\n  such thoughts, it is written: \"Do not defile your daughter.\" The Torah\n  obligates a rapist and a seducer to pay money rather than be punished\n  by lashes when the matter happened by chance, without the knowledge of\n  [the girl's] father, and she did not ready herself for [the\n  relations]. For this is an extraordinary and uncommon matter. If,\n  however, a person leaves his virgin daughter accessible for anyone to\n  engage in relations with her, this will cause the entire earth to be\n  filled with sexual immorality. For [ultimately], a father will marry\n  his daughter and a brother his sister, [for in a sexually permissive\n  society] a [girl] may become pregnant and give birth without knowing\n  who the child's father is. When a person has his daughter act in this\n  manner, she is considered to be a harlot, and both the man and the\n  girl who engage in relations should be punished by lashes, as\n  [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: \"There shall not be a kedesha.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From these passages of the Mishneh Torah it would seem to deduce that, contrary to what Rambam himself stated in Sefer Hamitzvot, an unmarried woman who has relations exclusively with one man, without therefore promiscuous sexuality, would not be qualified as a kedesha, regardless of whether or not such a woman can fit in the figure of the \"pilegesh\".Obviously, if the woman and the man were not halachically entitled to marry each other, the relations between them would make the woman a \"zonah\". </p>\n\n<p>How can these two apparently very divergent Rambam’s positions be reconciled?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishna (Rav Yosef Karo 15-16 century author of the Shulchan Aruch) qualifies when out of wedlock relations would be liable to Lashes in Naara Besula 2,17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש לדקדק דמשמע מדברי רבינו הכא דאינו לוקה משום קדשה אא\"כ היא מוכנת לכך ובפ\"א מאישות כתב כל הבועל אשה לשם זנות בלא קידושין לוקה מן התורה לפי שבעל קדשה וצריך לדחוק שסמך שם על מה שכתב כאן</p>\n  \n  <p>From here we deduce that they only gets lashes if she is set aside as a harlot, but in Ishus the Rambam writes any woman who has casual relations with one man outside wedlock for the sake of <em>Zenus</em> receives lashes, so the Rambam chose not to go into detail in Hilchos Ishus 1,4 which is about general marriage until he expounded in detail on the subject of an unmarried girl here in Naara Besula.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, if she was set aside to be a Harlot even one casual relation <em>she</em> is liable to lashes regardless whether she folds from her practice henceforth. </p>\n\n<p>Another explanation is given by the <em>Tevuas Shamesh</em> (רבי מאיר מגזע צבי Great-grandson of Shach commentary on Shulchan Aruch 18th century) <strong>Only a man</strong> is liable to lashes for relations outside wedlock if the woman <strong>didn't</strong> designate herself as a Harlot in <em>Ishus</em> 1,4 (and in Sefer Hamitzvos quoted in question):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כאן כתב רבינו לוקה הנבעלת משא\"כ בהלכות אישות כתב רבינו שלוקה הוא לבד:\n   Over Here (Naara Besula 2,17) <strong>she</strong> (because set herself aside a a Harlot)  gets lashes, whereas over there (Ishus 1,4 where she was not a designated Harlot) only He gets lashes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What is to be learnt from these words? Since it says, This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth,  I might think that this injunction is to be taken literally. Therefore it says, 'And thou shalt gather in thy corn', which implies that you are to combine the study of them with a worldly occupation. This is the view of R. Ishmael. R. Simeon b. Yohai says: Is that possible? If a man ploughs in the ploughing season, and sows in the sowing season, and reaps in the reaping season, and threshes in the threshing season, and winnows in the season of wind, what is to become of the Torah? No; but when Israel perform the will of the Omnipresent, their work is performed by others, as it says. And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks. etc., and when Israel do not perform the will of the Omnipresent their work is carried out by themselves, as it says, And thou shalt gather in thy corn.  Nor is this all, but the work of others also is done by them, as it says. And thou shalt serve thine enemy etc.  <strong>Said Abaye: Many have followed the advice of Ishmael, and it has worked well; others have followed R. Simeon b. Yohai and it has not been successful.</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_35.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation, my emphasis</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, this may not be analogous to our society. Rambam mentions the schedule of what was apparently a regular working person in his time:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=171\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Talmud Torah 1:12</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיצד היה בעל אומנות והיה עוסק במלאכתו שלש שעות ביום ובתורה תשע</p>\n  \n  <p>How so? If he was a craftsman and would engage in his work [for] three hours in the day, and [engage] in Torah for nine [hours]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like, a typical working scholar would actually spend the vast majority of his day learning rather than working. It is no surprise that a worker could be a scholar under such a regimen; that is probably the same amount of time a typical student spends learning per day in a full-time yeshiva program.</p>\n\n<p>The very next line in the above Talmudic passage also indicates something along these lines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל רבא לרבנן במטותא מינייכו ביומי ניסן וביומי תשרי לא תתחזו קמאי כי היכי דלא תטרדו במזונייכו כולא שתא</p>\n  \n  <p>Raba said to the Rabbis: I would ask you not to appear before me during Nisan and Tishri  so that you may not be anxious about your food supply during the rest of the year.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes it sound like the working scholars were still spending the vast majority of their time learning.</p>\n\n<p>However, with most modern professions it is not very practical to only work three hours per day, or only work two months out of the year. As such, we would expect it to be a lot harder to become a working scholar in these circumstances. Nevertheless, if you spend every free moment learning, you should be able to amass a considerable amount of time dedicated to learning.</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that The Talmud in fact asks a similar question:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=32b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 32b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן חסידים הראשונים היו שוהין שעה אחת ומתפללין שעה אחת וחוזרין ושוהין שעה אחת וכי מאחר ששוהין תשע שעות ביום בתפלה תורתן היאך משתמרת ומלאכתן היאך נעשית אלא מתוך שחסידים הם תורתם משתמרת ומלאכתן מתברכת</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: The pious men of old used to wait for an hour and pray for an hour and then wait again for an hour. But seeing that they spend nine hours a day over prayer, how is their knowledge of Torah preserved and how is their work done? [The answer is] that because they are pious, their Torah is preserved and their work is blessed.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_32.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These pious men of old spent as much time on prayer as a typical person might spend nowadays at work. The Talmud's answer to how they maintained their Torah knowledge with such limited time to devote to it seems to be that because of their piety they received special Divine assistance. Perhaps, then, a working scholar nowadays should strive to be especially pious.</p>\n\n<p>Returning back to the first Talmudic passage, we find another related point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבה בר בר חנה א\"ר יוחנן משום רבי יהודה בר' אלעאי בא וראה שלא כדורות הראשונים דורות האחרונים דורות הראשונים עשו תורתן קבע ומלאכתן עראי זו וזו נתקיימה בידן דורות האחרונים שעשו מלאכתן קבע ותורתן עראי זו וזו לא נתקיימה בידן</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbah b. Bar Hanah said in the name of R. Johanan, reporting R. Judah b. Ila'i: See what a difference there is between the earlier and the later generations. The earlier generations made the study of the Torah their main concern and their ordinary work subsidiary to it, and both prospered in their hands. The later generations made their ordinary work their main concern and their study of the Torah subsidiary, and neither prospered in their hands.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_35.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point here seems to be that the key to succeeding as a working scholar is to make sure that your Torah study is your main priority, and your work is just a side thing that you have to do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.1.9?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides, Laws of Torah Study 1:9:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גְּדוֹלֵי חַכְמֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הָיוּ מֵהֶן חוֹטְבֵי עֵצִים וּמֵהֶן שׁוֹאֲבֵי מַיִם וּמֵהֶן סוּמִים וְאַף עַל פִּי כֵן הָיוּ עוֹסְקִין בְּתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה בַּיּוֹם וּבַלַּיְלָה וְהֵם מִכְּלַל מַעְתִּיקֵי הַשְּׁמוּעָה אִישׁ מִפִּי אִישׁ מִפִּי משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ:</p>\n<p>Some of the great scholars in Israel were hewers of wood, some of them drawers of water, and some of them blind: nevertheless they engaged themselves in the study of the Torah by day and by night.

To answer the question however, it probably depended  on  how agreeable people were  in general to the concept of having multiple wives in that particular  location.</p>\n\n<p>Based on a Posuk, the Gemara (Yevamos 44A) says,  that if there was (e.g.) a large age gap between  the widow  and the brother, Beis Din would try to  convince them not to do Yibbum and end up with an unhappy marriage. It's safe to assume  they would have done the same in a place where multiple wives  didn't  work  out.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Although the reasons   for not doing Yibbum today and the reasons for not having more than one wife today,  are not the same, generally speaking  the communities that had a more positive  attitude towards multiple wives were also much later to  stop doing Yibbum  in favor of Chalitza.</p>\n\n\n",

If one is standing outside Palestine, he should turn mentally towards Eretz Israel, as it says, And pray unto Thee towards their land. If he stands in Eretz Israel he should turn mentally towards Jerusalem, as it says, And they pray unto the Lord toward the city which Thou hast chosen. If he is standing in Jerusalem he should turn mentally towards the Sanctuary, as it says, If they pray toward this house. If he is standing in the Sanctuary, he should turn mentally towards the Holy of Holies, as it says, If they pray toward this place.  If he was standing in the Holy of Holies he should turn mentally towards the mercy-seat.  If he was standing behind the mercy-seat  he should imagine himself to be in front of the mercy-seat. Consequently, if he is in the east he should turn his face to the west; if in the west he should turn his face to the east; if in the south he should turn his face to the north; if in the north he should turn his face to the south. In this way all Israel will be turning their hearts towards one place. R. Abin — or as some say R.

The second option in particular, if taken to the extreme, would mean that someone would have to determine the precise point in the Pacific Ocean where the shorter direction changes.</p>\n\n<p>This Beraita is codified by all the major codes, yet I did not find any of them, or the standard commentaries thereon, discuss this aspect. Rambam's formulation in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=576\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Tefilah 5:3</a> may avoid the whole issue, as he leaves out the end of the Beraita which discusses the actual directions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נכח המקדש כיצד היה עומד בחוצה לארץ מחזיר פניו נכח ארץ ישראל ומתפלל היה עומד בארץ מכוין את פניו כנגד ירושלים היה עומד בירושלים מכוין פניו כנגד המקדש היה עומד במקדש מכוין פניו כנגד בית קדש הקדשים סומא ומי שלא יכול לכוין את הרוחות והמהלך בספינה יכוין את לבו כנגד השכינה ויתפלל </p>\n  \n  <p>Facing the Temple: What is implied?</p>\n  \n  <p>A person standing in the Diaspora should face Eretz Yisrael and pray.</p>\n  \n  <p>One standing in Eretz Yisrael should face Jerusalem.</p>\n  \n  <p>One standing in Jerusalem should face the Temple.</p>\n  \n  <p>One standing in the Temple should face the Holy of Holies.</p>\n  \n  <p>A blind person, one who is unable to determine direction, or one travelling in a boat should direct his heart towards the Divine Presence and pray.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920167/jewish/Tefilah-and-Birkat-Kohanim-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be taken to mean that you can face any direction as long as it is towards Israel, since he doesn't mention any specific direction that must be faced.</p>\n\n<p>So, to conclude, which (if any) of my three options above are correct?</p>\n\n<p>Is this issue addressed in Rabbinic Literature?</p>\n\n<p>Are any of my geographical assumptions incorrect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the halachic principle of following proximity (הולכין אחר הקרוב) derived from the law of the עגלה ערופה (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.23b.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Bathra 23b</a>), it would seem that the longer route is irrelevant.  Notably, the maps you provide don't convey this entirely accurately, at least according to the view of Rav Yechiel Zilber (see MyZmanim.com that also cites Rav Yisrael Belsky, z\"l, who used more traditional map projections to determine davening direction; see also <a href=\"https://www.myzmanim.com/read/direction.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).

But most people are in places where there is a clear direction which is towards Israel and a clear away.</p>\n\n<p>If East and West are meant to say that one should face only the cardinal directions, or if they are just examples and one should face directly towards the Temple; that is a question that has nothing to do with a spherical Earth. It is dealt with in MB 94:11, where he claims that it is unanimous that one should face directly towards Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>In Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Bet Habechirah 7:8, Maimonides explains that Jews should refrain (or abstain) from facing west whenever they are going to sleep or using the bathroom. The reason for this is that the direction is facing the holy of holies in the west of the Temple. This law also prompts Jews to recall the Temple, for it is proper to do so. Can we apply this notion to Beraita? I think so. It is not that the Beraita or Maimonides were uneducated about the shape of the earth. It has halakhic ramifications since we need to remember the Temple with respect.</p>\n\n\n",

R. Eleazar said: From the day that God created His world there was no man called the Holy One, blessed be He, Zeboath [hosts] until Hannah came and called Him Zebaoth. Said Hannah before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of the Universe, of all the hosts and hosts that Thou hast created in Thy world, is it so hard in Thy eyes to give me one son? A parable: To what is this matter like? To a king who made a feast for his servants, and a poor man came and stood by the door and said to them, Give me a bite,  and no one took any notice of him, so he forced his way into the presence of the king and said to him, Your Majesty, out of all the feast which thou hast made, is it so hard in thine eyes to give me one bite?</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_31.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharsha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

His answer is that the Talmud only meant that she was the first <em>person to say it</em>, but not necessarily that it hadn't been ever used in this way before.</p>\n<p>This implied question and its answer seem puzzling. The Book of Samuel was presumably written after the events that it describes took place. Indeed, the Talmud elsewhere (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=14b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 14b</a>) states that Samuel himself was the author of the Book of Samuel. As Samuel was not yet born at the time of Hannah's prayer, surely he hadn't already written his book. Why then would the earlier verse be troubling? Chronologically it comes <em>after</em> Hannah's prayer, and the Talmud's claim can therefore be upheld with no difficulty.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the answer is that historically, Chanah was the first to use the term.

That is, the rear echelon of an army is their hindermost part. The Amalekites attacked Israel at their hindermost part or “tail.”</p>\n<p>The exact same Hebrew word is also found in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ge+3%3A15&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the serpent bites the \"hindermost part\" of the promised seed of the woman -- that is, the serpent is to attack his heel, since the heel is physiologically the hindermost part of the <em>human</em> body. The seed of the serpent is therefore the enemy of God. It is the intent of the seed of the serpent “to trip up” the seed of God.</p>\n<p>“Amalek” therefore is the enemy of the seed of God (Israel), who “trips up” at the most vulnerable time and opportunity. In the context of the Torah, the Amalekites in Canaan were not the seed of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites or the Jebusites, but of Esau (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2036%3A12&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 36:12</a>). When Esau was born, his twin brother tried “to trip him up” at birth, and therefore the twin brother was named “Jacob.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2025%3A24-26&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 25:24-26</a> (NASB)</p>\n<p><sup>24</sup> When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <sup>25</sup> Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau. <sup>26</sup> <em><strong>Afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob</strong></em>; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them. (Emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please note that “Jacob” (יַעֲקֹב) and “heel” (עָקֵב) are related etymologically in Hebrew. Later in his life, Jacob will deceive his father Isaac in order to inherit the blessing of the firstborn -- that is, Jacob had recognized the promises made to Abraham, and so he STROVE to seize those promises made to Abraham and Isaac. In his deception scheme, Jacob “tripped up” his brother Esau to this end. First he seized legal right to the birthright from Esau in exchange for a mess of pottage, when Esau was most vulnerable because of hunger. Secondly, he later schemed with his mother (Rebecca) to seize the blessing from his father, Isaac, through deception by pretending to be Esau.  Because Jacob was persistent to seize the Abrahamic promises from men like his brother Esau and his father Isaac, and because Jacob was persistent to seize some blessing of promise from the Angel of the LORD in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ge+32%3A28&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 32:28</a>, the Angel of the LORD changed his name from one who “trips up” to one who “persists” or “strives with God” (<em><strong>Israel</strong></em>).</p>\n<p>In other words, the Angel of the LORD sanctified the identity of the man who once had manipulated people as his <em>modus operandi</em> of life and living, to one who now was the seeker of God and his promises. His name was no longer to be “Jacob” (one who trips up others through manipulation), but was now to be “Israel” (one who strives with God [for the Promises made to Abraham and Isaac]).</p>\n<p>So in the Biblical narrative, the promised seed of the woman now becomes the promised seed of Abraham, which passes from Abraham to Isaac, and now Isaac to Jacob (Israel), whose sworn enemy will remain Amalek. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, Amalek later appears “to trip up” Israel when Israel had failed “to strive after God.” For example, Haman the Agagite (Book of Esther) was an Amalekite.</p>\n\n\n",

Or is the definition of majority more lenient?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Mishna states</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm curious how you know this particular clause from the Mishnah and not know that what you state is actually subject to a Tannaic dispute.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is this an absolute majority?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Horayos 1:5. As a quick summary of the various opinions recorded there:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>R' Meir:</strong> 50% of the congregation (even of six Shevatim) <em>or</em> 50% of at least seven Shevatim each (even if it's not a majority of all of Bnei Yisrael); if a Shevet follows its own Beis Din, a Karban is not brought.</li>\n<li><strong>R' Yehudah:</strong> 50% of at least seven Shevatim who follow the Sanhedrin, or 50% of a single Shevet who follows its own Beis Din.</li>\n<li><strong>R' Shimon:</strong> 50% of at least seven Shevatim; if a Shevet follows its own Beis Din, a Karban is not brought.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, all things considered, majority is basically what you assume it to be; at least a significant percentage of the Jewish populace. Nevertheless, from the example you bring it's clear that you're either unaware or misunderstanding an important point about this Karban: it doesn't matter how long it's been since they issued the mistaken ruling, so long as they haven't retracted yet. Consider Horayos 1:2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוֹרוּ בֵית דִּין, וְיָדְעוּ שֶׁטָּעוּ, וְחָזְרוּ בָהֶן, בֵּין שֶׁהֵבִיאוּ כַפָּרָתָן וּבֵין שֶׁלֹּא הֵבִיאוּ כַפָּרָתָן, וְהָלַךְ וְעָשָׂה עַל פִּיהֶן, רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן פּוֹטֵר, וְרַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר אוֹמֵר, סָפֵק.</p>\n  \n  <p>If Beis Din ruled, realized that they erred, and retracted, whether they had already brought their atonement or not, if an individual went and acted on their word, R' Shimon exempts [from an individual Chatas] and R' Eliezer says it's a doubt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Shimon, who exempts even after they retracted, would certainly say that he's exempt if he sinned before they retracted, regardless of how long it was since they ruled! As the Gemara explains his opinion (3b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב מ\"ט דר\"ש הואיל וברשות ב\"ד הוא עושה איכא דאמרי אמר רב יהודה אמר רב אומר היה ר\"ש כל הוראה שיצאה ברוב צבור יחיד העושה אותה פטור לפי שלא ניתנה הוראה אלא להבחין בין שוגג למזיד</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav: \"What is the reason for R' Shimon? Since he acted with the permission of Beis Din.\" Some say that Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav: \"R' Shimon used to say: Any ruling which is disseminated to the public, an individual who performs it is exempt, because ruling was only given to distinguish between mistaken and intentional acts.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to either line of logic, this should hold whether the courts reversed or not, regardless of how long it's been.</p>\n\n<p>Before I elaborate on R' Eliezer's opinion, let me quote the end of Mishnah Horayos, 1:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זה הכלל התולה בעצמו חייב והתולה בב\"ד פטור</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the general rule: One who hangs [his actions] on himself is liable [to a private Chatas], and one who hangs [his actions] on Beis Din is exempt [from a private Chatas].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that background, let's see how the Gemara explains R' Eliezer's opinion (3b-4a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר זירא משל דר\"א למה הדבר דומה לאדם שאכל ספק חלב ספק שומן ונודע לו שמביא אשם ולא מבעיא למ\"ד צבור מייתי דמפרסמא מלתא אלא אפילו למ\"ד ב\"ד מביאין דלא מפרסמא מלתא אי הוה שאיל הוו אמרין ליה</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Zeira said a parable for R' Eliezer. To what can this be compared? To someone who ate something which is doubtfully forbidden fats and doubtfully permitted fats, and later he found out [that it was forbidden] – he brings an Asham. It's not needed according to the one who said that the congregation brings the [communal sin offering], because the matter [i.e. that the court reversed its opinion] is publicized. But even according to the one who said that the courts bring it, where the matter is not publicized, if he had asked they would have told him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But since the doubt only arises whether he was relying on himself or the courts because they had already reversed, had they not yet reversed, he would surely agree that he's exempt!</p>\n\n<p>This is how the Rambam understands this procedure (Shegagos 12:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל דָּבָר שֶׁחַיָּבִין עַל שִׁגְגָתוֹ חַטָּאת קְבוּעָה אִם שָׁגְגוּ בֵּית דִּין הַגָּדוֹל בְּהוֹרָאָה וְהוֹרוּ לְהַתִּירוֹ וְשָׁגְגוּ הָעָם בְּהוֹרָאָתָן וְעָשׂוּ הָעָם וְהֵם סוֹמְכִין עַל הוֹרָאָתָן וְאַחַר כָּךְ נוֹדַע לְבֵית דִּין שֶׁטָּעוּ הֲרֵי בֵּית דִּין חַיָּבִין לְהָבִיא קָרְבַּן חַטָּאת עַל שִׁגְגָתָן בְּהוֹרָאָה </p>\n  \n  <p>Any matter for which one is obligated a Chatas for doing it by mistake, if the Sanhedrin ruled mistakenly and ruled to permit it, and the people erred through their ruling, and they acted, relying on their ruling, <em>and afterwards</em> the court realized that they erred, the court is obligated to bring a Chatas on their mistaken ruling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"And afterwards.\" No mention of how long it was in the interim.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I'm not convinced that a communal Karban is even brought in the particular example you provide. If the courts rule that there's no concept forbidding eating Kodshim while impure, there's no Karban brought, as they're uprooting an entire concept, not a specific detail in it (Horayos 1:4). (Depending on how you construe the case, \"impurity is permissible for the public\" (Sanhedrin 12b et. al.) may be relevant, but not necessarily.) As for anyone sacrificing outside the Temple – who gave them permission to do that? If they did so they'd be liable on their own count, as, again, if the courts ruled that that was permissible, they're uprooting an entire body of law. And for your presumption that \"even if everyone is at the Temple, most people should be Tahor\" – all you need is one dead body under the roof while everyone is there to make everyone Tamei, or else a well-placed Sheretz right at the doorstep such that everyone steps on it as they enter.</p>\n\n\n",

However, my Aramaic and Hebrew are basic and I cannot read Rashi script. I recently enjoyed a book called The Talmud: A Biography by Barry Scott Wimpfheimer, a Reform Rabbi, which I found particularly interesting because it takes the reader through a sugya, but then also considered Rashi, Rif and Tosefot on that sugya, thereby giving a taste of what it is like to study Gemara with traditional commentaries.</p>\n\n<p>I should be grateful if anyone knows of and could recommend any other books in English (ideally from a more orthodox perspective), that take a reader through one or two sugyot in this way with the traditional commentaries, showing how they are interpreted and how they lead to a final decision on halakhah.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's a great work by Rav Zevin, I believe translated into English as \"The festivals in Halacha\" published by artscroll.</p>\n\n<p>While it's not exactly on the Talmud, he picks questions about the chagim/festivals and show how they're developed by the rishonim and achronim. From what I remember most of the sugyas are based in the Talmud, or at least have Talmudic sources being brought in as proofs, and it will give you an enjoyable taste of what real Talmudic study is about.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There's a wonderful website called sefaria.org which has a translation of the entire talmud as well as many other texts, and depending on what it has translations of some commentaries as well. There's another website called mercava.org which is very similar although it breaks up the phrases of aramaic into smaller sizes (but it doesn't have nearly as many commentaries). In general, most translations (like artscroll, sefaria, etc.) implement Rashi's understanding, although i understand if that's not what you're looking for. There is also a website called dafyomi.co.il that breaks down each tosfos and explains what each phrase is accomplishing. Even if your reading skills aren't quite there yet, first of all, with time and practice they will get better, but also, if you take a look at the footnotes of an artscroll gemara (or in a Koren gemara, which isn't nearly as common) it may quote other gemaras which are worthwhile to look at in order to understand the sugya better by contrasting the principles in each gemara, and then you can use an artscroll over there. But if you're trying to experience what it's like to learn a sugya like someone in yeshiva would, then, if it's an option, maybe try reaching out to one near you who could learn with you.

Goren and R. Ginzberg on the parallel yBrachot 4:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ירמיה ספרא שאל לרב ירמיה ר\"ח שחל להיות בשבת במה קורין א\"ל קורין בר\"ח א\"ר חלבו קומי ר' אימי מתניתא אמרה כן לכל מפסיקין לראשי חדשים לחנוכה ולפורים</p>\n<p>Yirmiyah the Sofer asked R. Yirmiyah: On Shabbat Rosh Hodesh, what do we read [in the main Torah reading]? He replied: [We read] about Rosh Hodesh. R. Helbo said before R. Immi: The Mishnah agrees: \"They interrupt [the regular order] for anything: for Rosh Hodesh, for Hanukkah, for Purim, for fasts, for Ma'amadot, and for Yom HaKippurim.\" (<a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Mishnah_Megillah.3.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishnah Megillah 3:4</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the practice in Tannaitic times was that only the first Torah reader said a pre-<em>bracha</em> and that only the last reader said a post-<em>bracha</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Megillah.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 4:1</a>). However, some specific portions of Torah reading require their own <em>brachot</em> (perhaps not the same ones as the <em>brachot</em> mentioned above). For example, in Yerushalmi Megillah 3:7 (= <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14138&st=&pgnum=507\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vilna 26b</a>, also Soferim 12:4, p. 225 ed. Higer), we read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' יוסה בי רבי בון תמנתי פסוקיא אחריא דמשנה תורה טעונין ברכה לפניהן ולאחריהן בלא כך אין הפותח והחותם בתורה מברך לפניה ולאחריה לכן צריכה ראש חודש שחל להיות בשבת</p>\n<p>R. Yose ben R. Bun [said]: the last eight verses of Deuteronomy require a <em>bracha</em> before and after. Without this [statement], doesn't the first and last reader of Torah make a <em>bracha</em> before and after? But this [statement] is necessary for Rosh Hodesh that falls on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand the question on R. Yose ben R. Bun to be asking about the necessity to state the requirement for a post-<em>bracha</em> (since the person reading these verses will necessarily be the last reader, and so automatically will require a post-<em>bracha</em>; see the Korban HaEdah). However, I don't understand the resolution of this <em>gemara</em>. Some explanations I've read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some commentaries explain that the case is reading the Rosh Hodesh reading as <em>aliyah</em> 7 after reading the last eight verses of the Torah in <em>aliyah</em> 6. One needs to make an after-<em>bracha</em> after <em>aliyah</em> 6, even though this isn't the last reader. But this is unsatisfactory, since it's in contradiction to (the way I understand) the triennial cycle (R. Kanievsky explains this way, and concludes that this gemara disagrees with the rest of the Yerushalmi). This explanation would be more satisfactory if there were other sections of the Yerushalmi that also taught this way.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Heinrich Guggenheimer explains that the Rosh Hodesh reading (Numbers 28:11-15) had to be read seven times on Shabbat (explaining mishnah Megillah 3:4 as we have above, and since having 5 verses, it can't be split). He says: \"Since starting and finishing readers read the same text, it remains questionable why they should differ in their benedictions\". It isn't clear to me what Guggenheimer is saying: is his conclusion that in fact all <em>seven</em> readers say both <em>brachot</em>, since they all read the same thing? Or that in spite of it being \"questionable\", still only the first and last reader say one <em>bracha</em> each? And how does this relate to the original question about the last eight verses of the Torah?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can anyone explain this <em>gemara</em>, either with a separate explanation than the above two, or explaining one/both of the above explanations in a more satisfactory way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Fleischer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra Fleischer</a> wrote an article in Tarbiz 73:1 entitled <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23605062\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Remarks Concerning the Triennial Cycle of the Torah Reading in Eretz Israel</a>. On page 111 (29 of his article), he discusses the question of the Eretz Yisrael practice of Torah reading on Shabbat Rosh Hodesh. His conclusion is that although the very early practice (Practice A) was to interrupt the regular Torah reading on Shabbat Rosh Hodesh (as in the mishna and the first Yerushalmi paragraph in the OP), this was discontinued very early (giving practice B, in the second paragraph in the OP). He posits that reading and rereading the same short and impersonal (סתמית) Rosh Hodesh Torah reading <em>seven times</em> was a great difficulty on congregations, and that it was very quickly discontinued (באִבו). He proves this from several sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/b/f/f2a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Megillah 3:1-2</a> (up to וכן בפורים), that omits Rosh Hodesh from the list in 3:2. He mentions that R. Lieberman in his <em>Tosefta Kifshuta</em> (ad loc) suggests that the author of the Tosefta already had Practice B. [Although the Tosefta we have is often a Babylonian recension, —M72] Fleischer shows by reference to the list in 3:2 that the Tosefta is also dealing with a triennial cycle.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Yerushalmi Megillah 3:7 paragraph in the OP, which R. Lieberman cites as evidence for his supposition (supporting R. Kanievsky's position that the gemara disagrees with the mishna).</p></li>\n<li><p>A qedushata of the Qaliri (6th/7th century) for Shabbat Rosh Hodesh that references two readings for Rosh Hodesh. It includes the lines פותחים בעניין ומשלימים בו בחודש and </p></li>\n<li><p>The Pesiqta of Rav Kahana has no drasha for Shabbat Rosh Hodesh, and in Pesikta Rabbati, the drasha for Rosh Hodesh is based around the haftara, not the Torah reading.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In support of shifting from Practice A to B, he notes that on Shabbat Rosh Hodesh of Hanukka, HaHodesh, Sheqalim, there would be no choice but for the reading to be both Rosh Hodesh and the reading of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it seems that there's no contradiction in Yerushalmi sections in the OP, but that they represent distinct practices.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rambam and Chazal\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In his letter to Chachmei Luniel, Rambam says that the belief in astrology was a minority view in chazal and we should not follow it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...it is not proper to abandon matters of reason that have already\n  been verified by proofs, shake loose of them, and depend on the words\n  of a single one of the sages from whom possibly the matter was hidden\n  (Isadore Twersky Translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Moreh 2:26, he admits it is possible some sages(Pirkei Dirabi Eliezer) held like Plato, even though he thinks such an opinion is very wrong.</p>\n\n<p>What are other examples of him specifically saying an opinion he finds to be abhorrent was held by a minority in Chazal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In Guide for the Perplexed 3:48 Rambam identifies the opinion of a Mishnah (at least according to one interpretation in the Talmud) as being one of two philosophical opinions he discussed earlier:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When in the Talmud (Ber. p. 33b) those are blamed who use in their prayer the phrase, \"Thy mercy extendeth to young birds,\" it is the expression of the one of the two opinions mentioned by us, namely, that the precepts of the Law have no other reason but the Divine will. We follow the other opinion.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we look back at that discussion in Guide for the Perplexed 2:26 we see the two opinions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Theologians are divided on the question whether the actions of God are the result of His wisdom, or only of His will without being intended for any purpose whatever, so they are also divided as regards the object of the commandments which God gave us. Some of them hold that the commandments have no object at all; and are only dictated by the win of God. Others are of opinion that all commandments and prohibitions are dictated by His wisdom and serve a certain aim; consequently there is a reason for each one of the precepts: they are enjoined because they are useful.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp162.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Guide for the Perplexed 3:31 he reveals the abhorrent nature of the second opinion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THERE are persons who find it difficult to give a reason for any of the commandments, and consider it right to assume that the commandments and prohibitions have no rational basis whatever. They are led to adopt this theory by <strong>a certain disease in their soul</strong>, the existence of which they perceive, but which they are unable to discuss or to describe. For they imagine that these precepts, if they were useful in any respect, and were commanded because of their usefulness, would seem to originate in the thought and reason of some intelligent being. But as things which are not objects of reason and serve no purpose, they would undoubtedly be attributed to God, because no thought of man could have produced them. According to the theory of <strong>those weak-minded persons</strong>, man is more perfect than his Creator.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp167.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Though it exceeds the scope of this question/answer, it is worth noting that Rambam in other writings seems to accept the very view he decries here.)</p>\n<p>Another instance in which he asserts that a minority of Chazal was wrong on a fundamental theological matter (though perhaps not abhorrently so) is in Guide for the Perplexed 2:29. There he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our opinion, in support of which we have quoted these passages, is clearly established, namely, that no prophet or sage has ever announced the destruction of the Universe, or a change of its present condition, or a permanent change of any of its properties. When our Sages say, \"The world remains six thousand years, and one thousand years it will be waste,\" they do not mean a complete cessation of existing things; the phrase \"one thousand years it will be waste\" distinctly shows that time will continue: besides, <strong>this is the individual opinion of one Rabbi, and in accordance with one particular theory</strong>. But on the other hand the words, \"There is nothing new under the sun\" (Eccles. i. 9), in the sense that no new creation takes place in any way and under any circumstances, express the general opinion of our Sages, and include a principle which every one of the doctors of the Mishnah and the Talmud recognises and makes use of in his arguments.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp116.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar example occurs with another fundamental matter of theology in Guide for the Perplexed 3:17. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We, however, believe that all these human affairs are managed with justice; far be it from God to do wrong, to punish any one unless the punishment is necessary and merited. It is distinctly stated in the Law, that all is done in accordance with justice; and the words of our Sages generally express the same idea. They clearly say: \"There is no death without sin, no sufferings without transgression.\" (B. T. Shabbath, 55a.) Again, \"The deserts of an are meted out to him in the same measure which he himself employs.\" (Mish. Sotah, i. 7.) These are the words of the Mishnah. Our Sages declare it wherever opportunity is given, that the idea of God necessarily implies justice; that He will reward the most pious for all their pure and upright actions, although no direct commandment was given them through a prophet; and that He will punish all the evil deeds of men, although they have not been prohibited by a prophet, if common sense warns against them, as e.g., injustice and violence. Thus our Sages say: \"God does not deprive any being of the full reward [of its good deed]\" (B. T. Pes. 118a) again, \"He who says that God remits part of a punishment;, will be punished severely; He is long-suffering, but is sure to exact payment.\" (B. T. Baba K. 50a.) Another saying is this: \"He who has received a commandment and acts accordingly is not like him who acts in the same manner without being commanded to do so\" (B. T. Kidd. 31a); and it is distinctly added that he who does a good thing without being commanded, receives nevertheless his reward. The same principle is expressed in all sayings of our Sages. But they contain an additional doctrine which is not found in the Law; viz., the doctrine of \"afflictions of love,\" <strong>as taught by some of our Sages</strong>. According to this doctrine it is possible that a person be afflicted without having previously committed any sin, in order that his future reward may be increased; a view which is held by the Mu’tazilites, but is not supported by any Scriptural text.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp153.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that in this case he not only rejects what he terms a minority view, he accepts instead a Talmudic opinion which the Talmud explicitly claims to have refuted!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואל תבקשני לתאם כל מה שאמרו מעניני התכונה עם המצב כפי שהוא, לפי\n  שהמדעים באותו הזמן היו חסרים, ולא דברו בכך משום שיש להם מסורת באותם\n  הדברים מן הנביאים, אלא מצד שהם ידעני אותם הדורות באותם המקצועות, או\n  שמעום מידעני אותם הדורות, ולא בגלל זה נאמר על דברים שמצאנו להם שהם\n  מתאימים עם האמת שהם בלתי נכונים או שתאמו במקרה, אלא כל מה שאפשר לבאר\n  דברי האדם כדי שיהא תואם את המציאות שהוכחה מציאותה הוא יותר עדיף ונכון\n  לבעל הטבעים הנעלים ואיש הצדק. עכ\"ל</p>\n  \n  <p>“You must, however, not expect that everything our Sages say\n  respecting astronomical matters should agree with observation, for\n  mathematics were not fully developed in those days: and their\n  statements were not based on the authority of the Prophets, but on the\n  knowledge which they either themselves possessed or derived from\n  contemporary men of science.”  (Guide, 3:14)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Blot out the memory of Amalek or kill his descendants?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can a prophet issue commands that go beyond the Torah?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah says only to blot out Amalek's memory:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Lord said to Moses, \"... I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.\"  [Ex. 17:14, Deut. 25:19]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But later Samuel tells King Saul to wipe out the Amalekites physically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Samuel said to Saul ... “Thus said the Lord of Hosts: ... Go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them.  Slay man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” [1Sam 15:1-33]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Isn't that going beyond the Torah?  Some commentators have said as much:</p>\n\n<p>-Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch: the command was to destroy “the remembrance of Amalek”, not kill Amalekites. [Hirsch on Deut. 25] </p>\n\n<p>-The Sfat Emet: the command was to hate Amalek, not perform any action. [Shemot Zachor 346] </p>\n\n<p>-The Chafetz Chayyim: God will eliminate Amalek. Jews are only commanded to remember what Amalek did to them.</p>\n\n<p>-Rabbi Simcha Bunim: the Torah says “blot out the memory of Amalek” (כִּֽי־מָחֹ֤ה אֶמְחֶה֙ אֶת־זֵ֣כֶר עֲמָלֵ֔ק מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָֽיִם׃) in the singular, not the plural. Not the Amalekites, but Amalek.</p>\n\n<p>I know the Talmud says we must not try to kill Amalekites today because we lost the ability to recognize them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But Sennacherib, King of Assyria, had come up already and confused all the lands as it is said in Isaiah, “I have removed the bounds of the peoples,” [Isaiah 10:13]  So the rabbis decreed that the seven nations of Canaan no longer exist because the Assyrians [and not the Israelites] wiped them out. [Yoma 54a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On this basis, 19th-century Turkish rabbi Hayyim Palaggi said that we lost the tradition of how to recognize Amalekites, so we cannot fulfill the commandment to wipe them out. [Enei Kol Hai 73, on Sanhedrin 96b]</p>\n\n<p>But my question stands:  <strong>How can a prophet issue commands that go beyond the Torah?</strong>  Deut. 13:1 says: Do not add to or subtract from the Torah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The prophet <strong>on his own</strong> cannot add or subtract from the torah. However, Hashem can tell the prophet to do a specific action for a problem that occurs at a specific time (הוראת שעה). Thus Shmuel was giving Shaul instructions that Hashem had said to pass on and do. This was the method that Hashem had said to use in order to destroy the memory of Amalek.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of Hashem issuing specific commands that would otherwise be forbidden would be His telling Eliyahu Hanavi to bring a sacrifice and challenge the priests of baal. Since this was after the building of the temple in Yerushalayim, it was normally forbidden to bring a sacrifice on a private altar. Had Eliyahu attempted to do it himself it would have been forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

Planting flowers on a grave is indeed not a Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>Why is this? Allow me to share with you the contents of a letter written by the great Hungarian chassidic rebbe and halachist, Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira of Munkacs (1871–1937), to a rabbi in whose town some people had wanted to plant flowers on the graves of the wealthy Jews. Rabbi Spira was of the opinion that this was not to be done. Here were the reasons behind his ruling:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our sages taught that the rich and the poor must be buried alike. (This is why all Jews—regardless of means—are buried in identical linen shrouds.) Placing flowers on the graves of the wealthy drives unnecessary barriers between the classes.</li>\n<li>Placing edible items into a casket is forbidden according to Jewish law, as it a waste of G‑d’s bounty. Similarly, putting good, fragrant flowers (which could possibly be used as spices) in a place where they will not be used, says Rabbi Spira, is an infraction of the same law.</li>\n<li>It is forbidden to use or benefit from the casket or anything associated with the dead—even the earth which covers them. As such, enjoying the fragrance of flowers placed on graves would be forbidden, and planting flowers there in the first place is just inviting trouble.</li>\n<li>The most important reason is that, as you pointed out, it is not a Jewish custom, but rather a non-Jewish practice. We read in Leviticus 18:3, “Like the practices of the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you, you shall not do, and you shall not follow their statutes.” This means that a Jew must be careful not to follow the practices of the non-Jews. It was primarily because of this reason that Rabbi Spira ruled that it is to be avoided.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

While they note that many Siddurim and Mishnayos have a list which alphabetizes the Mishnayos by letter, I’m struggling to find such a list online.

All these ten names by which the angels are called designate their respective ten degrees; the degree which has nothing higher than itself, save only the degree of God, blessed is He! is the degree of the form which is called Living Creatures; thus it is spoken of in prophecy as being beneath the Throne of Glory. And the tenth degree is the degree of the form known as Men, which are the angels who speak with the prophets and appear to them in the vision of prophecy.

The Talmud there was attempting to adduce a support for a statement of Reish Lakish. The Mishnah had said that if someone declares himself  a nazirite and someone else says “me too”, they are both nazirites. The Mishnah listed “me too” twice (i.e. two different people both said “me too”). Reish Lakish said that this only applies if the “me too”s were within toch kedei dibbur.</p>\n<p>The Talmud seeks to argue that the wording of the Mishnah supports this. The Mishnah only listed two “me too”s because that is the maximum possible. Anything more than that would exceed toch kedei dibbur.</p>\n<p>It is to this argument that the Talmud responds with the line you are asking about. “Is the tanna like a peddler to go on and on listing?”</p>\n<p>Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהכא לא תסייע ליה דבדין הוא דהוה ליה למיתני עד מאה אלא לאו אורחיה דתנא כי רוכלא דמחזר על העיירות בפרגמטי׳ שלו והולך ומכריז ומונה יש לי מחטין וכוסות וקערות ה״נ ליחשיב וליזיל</p>\n<p>From here there is no support for him, for in fact he would have taught [even] up to a hundred. Except that it is not the way of the tanna [to be] like a peddler who goes around the cities with his merchandise and goes and announces and lists “I have needles, goblets, and plates” here too going on listing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosafot explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומשני אטו תנא כי רוכלא כו׳ כלומר אה״נ דהוי מצי לאיתנויי ארבע פעמים ואני ולא חש למנות כל מה שהיה יכול למנות</p>\n<p>And [the Talmud] answers: is a tanna like a peddler etc.? Meaning to say, it is true that [the tanna] could have taught “me two” four times, but he didn’t care to list everything that he could list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In essence, then, this Talmudic phrase is an argument that says that you can’t prove something from the fact that a tanna listed a limited number of specific things. The reason a tanna only lists a few things might not be that those are the only things that the rule is applicable to; it may simply be that the tanna wouldn’t bother listing everything applicable, and would just give a couple of examples.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The meaning is that a Tanna is not expected to list each entity, if unnecessary to convey the idea the Tanna is trying to convey, as opposed to a merchant who lists each and every of his merchandise when he's trying to make a sale.  Thus, for example, in context, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.33a.1?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 33a</a>, where the gemara refutes a proof that only 2 judges are required based on only 2 being mentioned by a Tanna explaining that they be mentioned by name, Sefaria translates:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is that to say that the tanna should have continued counting judges like a peddler?

The tell-tale sign for that is the dagesh in the letter tet (ט). The hei haydiyah, which functions in a similar, but not identical, way to the definite article \"the\" in English typically takes a patach except when it precedes certain letters. In those few cases, the hei haydiyah can take a kamatz or even a segol. The hei haydiyah also causes the letter following it to take a dagesh chazak. Several other prepositions, such as kaf and lamed, can combine with the hei haydiyah. When they combine, they loose their normal sh'va and take on the patach (or kamatz or segol, if that's the case) of the hei haydiyah, and the following letter stills takes a dagesh chazak (for letters that can take a dagesh, of course). \nInterestingly, this can affect the English translation. If the pasuk you brought was saying \"as is good in your eyes,\" it would have just been a kaf with a sh'va. But this is literally saying, \"as is <em>the</em> good in your eyes,\" which we might translate more comfortably as \"as is <em>best</em> in your eyes.\" \nNote also that the kaf here has a dagesh kal despite the preceding letter being a vav because there is a mafsik (separating) ta'am on the word <em>bo</em>.\nI'm getting all this from <em>The Complete Torah Reading Handbook</em> by Dr Ely Simon, Judaica Press, New York, 1996.           </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are nine instances where the prepositional phrase “כטוב” occurs in Scripture.

This is the paradigm which G-d established on the fourth day of creation as stated in Bereshit 1:14-15 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים <strong>יְהִ֤י מְאֹרֹת֙</strong> בִּרְקִ֣יעַ הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם <strong>לְהַבְדִּ֕יל בֵּ֥ין הַיּ֖וֹם וּבֵ֣ין הַלָּ֑יְלָה</strong> וְהָי֤וּ לְאֹתֹת֙ וּלְמ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים וּלְיָמִ֖ים וְשָׁנִֽים׃\n   <strong>וְהָי֤וּ לִמְאוֹרֹת֙ בִּרְקִ֣יעַ הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם לְהָאִ֖יר עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ</strong> וַֽיְהִי־כֵֽן׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the key is understanding what is being referred to with the two <em>sources of light</em>.</p>\n\n<p>These sources of light are referring to Moshiach ben Yosef, the Moshiach of Exile, which is compared to <em>night</em> and Moshiach ben David, the Moshiach of the redemption, which is compared to <em>day</em>. </p>\n\n<p>This relationship is also alluded to from Esther 8:16 which connects the idea of <em>light</em> to <em>joy</em> and <em>gladness</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לַיְּהוּדִ֕ים הָֽיְתָ֥ה <strong>אוֹרָ֖ה וְשִׂמְחָ֑ה וְשָׂשֹׂ֖ן</strong> וִיקָֽר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And also from the words of the Prophet of the Redemption, Isaiah in 35:10</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּפְדוּיֵ֨י יְהוָ֜ה יְשֻׁב֗וּן וּבָ֤אוּ צִיּוֹן֙ בְּרִנָּ֔ה וְשִׂמְחַ֥ת עוֹלָ֖ם עַל־רֹאשָׁ֑ם <strong>שָׂשׂ֤וֹן וְשִׂמְחָה֙</strong> יַשִּׂ֔יגוּ וְנָ֖סוּ יָג֥וֹן וַאֲנָחָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This follows <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kol_HaTor.2.147?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">what is taught in the name of the Vilna Gaon in Kol HaTor 2:147</a>.</p>\n\n<p>, Isaiah 51:3 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי־נחם יהוה ציון נחם כל־חרבתיה וישם מדברה כעדן וערבתה כגן־יהוה <strong>ששון ושמחה</strong> ימצא בה תודה וקול זמרה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and Isaiah 51:11.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופדויי יהוה ישובון ובאו ציון ברנה ושמחת עולם על־ראשם <strong>ששון ושמחה</strong> ישיגון נסו יגון ואנחה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The roots of <em>Sassone</em> (gladness) and <em>Simchah</em> (joy) are שש and שמח, which begin the letter  <em>Sin</em> which sounds like the letter <em>Samech</em> and actually replaces that letter in the order of the Aleph-Beit of this piyut.</p>\n\n<p>That <em>Samach</em> (שמח) is connected with Moshiach ben David is actually alluded to by G-d directly in Shemot <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.13-14?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:13-14</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר בי אדני <strong>שלח־נא ביד־תשלח</strong>\n   ויחר־אף יהוה במשה ויאמר הלא אהרן אחיך הלוי ידעתי כי־דבר ידבר הוא וגם הנה־הוא יצא לקראתך וראך <strong>ושמח בלבו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as <strong>שלח־נא ביד־תשלח</strong> refers to Moshiach, the final Redeemer, so too ו<strong>שמח</strong> בלבו also refers to Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>And this also alludes to one of the details of the final redemption, namely the elimination of death (<strong>ס</strong>ם <strong>מ</strong>ות) which comes to the world via the Angel of death, Sama'el spelled סמאל.</p>\n\n<p>And that relates to the conversion of the letter Samech to the letter Sin, in the same type of sign that was given to Moshe Rabbeinu in the first redemption as mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.17?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 4:17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.8-15?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 7:8-15</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Moshe was told to demonstrate to Pharaoh, to show his staff,

The following text of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.12.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalm 12:8</a> (Plate 890, Fragment 4) comes from the caves of Naḥal Ḥever. The general consensus among scholars is that these fragments date somewhere between the third and first centuries BCE. In this respect, this fragment would be the best presumptive witness to the “original” version of this verse in Hebrew.

That is, the word (תשמרם) and the word that follows (תצרנו) are 1.25 cm apart. This physical distance between these two words in the middle of the verse coincides with the dichotomy of each verse in the Masoretic Text based on the accent marks, which are based on the vowels. That is, the Masoretic Text, which would appear more than 1,000 years later, contains a codified system of cantillation, which is musical but is based on the logical divisions and dichotomies of the verses of Scripture. These dichotomies stem from the vowels, which (while not evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls) were communicated through oral tradition. In other words, this fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls contains the same separation (dichotomy) as the Masoretic Text, which leads us to conclude that the vowels existed through oral tradition, otherwise the dichotomies would not be evident.

This dichotomy in this fragment is an exact coincidence with the received Tiberian Masoretic Text of today.</p>\n<p>Finally, one renown authority on Hebrew cantillation in the 19th Century was Dr. William Wickes. Wickes believed that the vowels and cantillation were two sides of the same coin. In his treatise he writes that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FROM time immemorial the reading of the sacred books in the synagogue has been a kind of cantillation, or musical declamation. <em><strong>This mode of recitation was propagated at first, and through many generations, by oral instruction and manual signs alone.</strong></em> At length—probably towards the close of the seventh century of our era—the attempt was made to represent it by written signs, introduced into the text. . . . <em><strong>The introduction of these musical signs was, in all probability, simultaneous with that of the vowel-signs</strong></em>—an improvement in which, too, the Syrians had led the way. <em><strong>The one notation fixed the traditional pronunciation of each word, the other its traditional modulation. The two together furnished the needful directions to the Reader for the correct recitation of the sacred text.</strong></em> (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>These alignments of dichotomy and words (and, by extension, vowels) therefore provide the best witness to the “original” version of this verse in Hebrew. The <em><strong>presumptive</strong></em> conclusion here is that the Masoretes codified the oral tradition of vowels and accentuation, which came from the inspired authors of Scripture.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>SOURCE: Wickes, William (1887), <em><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1608994422\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Two Treatises on the Accentuation of the Old Testament</a></em>; Oxford: Clarendon Press, Vol I, pp.1-2.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Berachot 35a - If a before-beracha is more compelling than an after-beracha how do we know that an after-beracha is required?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud in the beginning of the sixth chapter of Masechet Berachot seeks to find the source that blessings are required for food. At one point in this adventure, the Talmud concludes that there is one available exposition to teach us the requirement of blessings, but if that is the case then we would only know the requirement of an after-blessing but not a before-blessing. The Talmud then explains that we would be able to derive the requirement for a before-blessing using a <em>kal vachomer</em> from the requirement for an after-blessing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי נמי יליף גזרה שוה אשכחן לאחריו לפניו מנין הא לא קשיא דאתיא בקל וחומר כשהוא שבע מברך כשהוא רעב לא כל שכן</p>\n<p>And even if he does avail himself of a <em>gezerah shawah</em>, while we are satisfied that a blessing is required after it, whence do we learn that it is required [before partaking]? — This is no difficulty. We derive it by argument <em>a fortiori</em>: If he says a blessing when he is full, how much more so ought he to do so when he is hungry?</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_35.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to be assuming that it is more likely for there to be a requirement for a before-blessing than for there to be a requirement for an after-blessing. Thus if there is a requirement for an after-blessing (based on the one available exposition) then there would certainly be a requirement for a before-blessing.</p>\n<p>But if that is the case, then perhaps there is <em>only</em> a requirement for a before-blessing and not an after-blessing. How can we assign the one available exposition to be a source for an after-blessing? That exposition should be applied to require a before-blessing, since if we have a choice between which should be required it would be a before-blessing. Once that is true there should be no source left to tell us that an after-blessing is required (except by bread which has an explicit verse)!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Great question! \nI think that is what רש\"י ד\"ה אשכחן לאחריו (and תוס' תינח) there is explaining, that the only kind of ברכה that we find in the תורה is the ברכה אחרונה of ברכת המזון for bread, therefore we can only establish the פסוק to be referring to such a type of ברכה that we already know exists.</p>\n\n\n",

So Ramban can’t put Hilchos Challah on its Masechta. </p>\n\n<p>If I had to guess why it’s in Bechoros, then, it’d be because that’s the next best place for it: the only Masechta in Bavli which deals with gifts to the Kohanim as its primary subject. (While Zevachim and Chullin both deal with Matnos Kehunah as a major subject, only Bechoros among Bavli Masechtos has it as its <em>main</em> subject.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would like to supplement <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/111285/19563\">DonielF's answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most mesechtos have the Halachos of the Rif written on them, and one of the exceptions is Bechoros. The other exceptions, other than the purely kodshim mesechtos, are Nedarim and Nidda. Hilchos nidda are included in meseches Shevuos, where there is a sugya about nidda. (They are then copied in the back of meseches Nidda in the modern editions.)</p>\n\n<p>When the Ramban came to fill in the missing mesechtos of Nedarim and Bechoros (which, while being a kodshim mesechta, is mostly practical halacha nowadays, at least in rare circumstances), he did similar to the Rif, and included an additional mesechta that wouldn't have its own halahchos. There is a sugya about chalah in the middle of Bechoros, so that was the most appropriate place to put it in.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why wasn't Rabbi Akiva made nasi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Per @user6591's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/98417/20472\">answer</a> on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/98410/why-did-the-davidic-dynasty-need-to-come-from-questionable-relations\">this question</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See the gemara in Yoma 22b.\nThis was orchestrated in order to ensure the longevity of his kingdom.\nAs Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: One appoints a leader over the community only if he has a box full of creeping animals hanging behind him, i.e., he has something inappropriate in his ancestry that preceded him. Why is that? It is so that if he exhibits a haughty attitude toward the community, one can say to him: Turn and look behind you and be reminded of your humble roots.\nSefaria's explanation based on Rashi spells out:\nThis is why David’s kingdom lasted while Saul’s did not, as David descended from a family with problematic ancestry, namely Tamar (see Genesis, chapter 38) and Ruth the Moabite (see Ruth 4:18–22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this is so, that it's actually important that a leader have some sort of less-prominent background, why wasn't Rabbi Akiva made a nasi instead of Rabban Gamliel?</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.27b.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 27b</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shall we establish Rabbi Akiva in his place? The Sages rejected that option because Rabbi Akiva, who descended from a family of converts, would be vulnerable. Perhaps due to Rabban Gamliel’s resentment he would cause him to be divinely punished as he lacks the merit of his ancestors to protect him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like in Yoma that having a poor background is a merit because it humbles the person. So wouldn't this have been enough to protect Rabbi Akiva from Rabban Gamliel? Furthermore, surely Rabban Gamliel knew of many previous leaders who didn't have important \"Yichus\" – In fact, part of Rabban Gamliel's ancestry was the House of David, no less (exactly what was discussed in Yoma 22b) – why then should this disqualify Rabbi Akiva? Why would he attempt to punish him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=37956#p=407\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha to Yoma there</a> (ד\"ה תלויה):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה דנקט מאחוריו דלא הוה איצטריך ליה אלא לאשמועינן דלא איירי אלא בדופי שאינו נגלה ומפורסם כ״כ דוגמת אחוריו וכמו דופי ממשפחת האם דומיא שפרש״י דופי של מלכות בית דוד שהיה מצד אם אבל דופי שמצד אב שהוא מפורסם במשפחה הוא גנאי למלכות גם לדין של ד״נ דבעי אב מישראל ופסול ברק אמו מישראל ולזה נמי אפשר דנקט נמי קופה של שרצים שהשרצים אינן מגולין כ״כ בה כמו מצד משפחת אם והיינו נמי שא״ל חזור לאחוריך בפסול שאינו נגלה כ״כ ודו״ק:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, he says that קופה של שרצים represents some kind of questionable ancestry in the female line (as with David, and hence Rabban Gamliel, where the questions raised about David were because of his descent from Ruth). That kind of thing is generally less well known than a defect in ancestry from the father's side (as with R' Akiva, who was descended from Sisera).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Also, it's not so much that Rabban Gamliel would hold R' Akiva's ancestry against him (and try to punish him for it). It's rather that <em>if</em> Rabban Gamliel would be offended at R' Akiva's taking over the position, then Heavenly retribution would be called down on R' Akiva, to defend Rabban Gamliel's honor,* and R' Akiva would lack זכות אבות to counteract that.</p>\n<p>* In the somewhat similar incident in Bava Metzia 59b, R' Eliezer, who had just been excommunicated, just cried about it, and didn't call for any retribution against Rabban Gamliel or the other Chachamim – and yet there were severe effects in the world afterwards, and in fact Rabban Gamliel almost lost his life. Many other such examples can be cited, including from Berachos 38a (today's daf), where two students who offended Bar Kappara passed away shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There seems to be 2 different powers at play here, each belonging to a different realm.</p>\n<p><strong>The Gemara in Yoma</strong> isn’t dealing with whatever power stems from yichus or lack there of. It’s simply talking about humility, a character trait that strengthens a person AGAINST HIMSELF. It prevents a person from acting haughty and doing things that bring himself down. The requirement to have holes in your yichus is just a way to secure this humility.</p>\n<p><strong>The Gemara in Brachos</strong> on the other hand, is dealing with a more abstract power, of which its utility is for EXTERNAL HARMFUL FORCES. In this case, the external force is R. Gamliels potential resentment, which would cause heaven to interfere on his behalf, potentially harming R. Akiva. The Gemara prescribes yichus, which has the (more mystical) power to prevent such harm.</p>\n<p>The fact that R. Akiva had humility is great, but it’s not going to protect him from such a force, just like compassion won’t. They’re both great things to have, and will certainly help you in life, but they just have a different utility.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the view of the Gemara seems to be that humility is the bedrock of a ruler. However, that’s just a general rule to be applied to someone who doesn’t have any known mystical forces working against him. In a case where there are, the Gemara is willing to forgo the humility requirement just so that the person can be physically capable of ruling at all.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Regarding that last part of your question, it doesn’t sound like R. Gamliel is intentionally trying to harm R. Akiva, and certainly not because of his lack of yichus. Merely that he harbours resentment due to being “fired”, and the resentment of someone of such a stature would unintentionally cause harm. This harm would apply to anyone who assumed the position, not just R. Akiva. However, someone who assumed the position but had the power of good yichus would be defended from such harm.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why is the fear of natural death not addressed by the Nevi’im?",
    "content": "# Why is the fear of natural death not addressed by the Nevi’im?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom. I’ve become somewhat perplexed by the lack of words of comfort and reassurance regarding death (in general) in the Nevi’im. I am a Gentile so am wondering if Israel has a different conception of, or relationship to, natural death than other peoples. For me, natural death is quite a big thing! Thus I expected Hashem to have had more to say in response to such concerns and fears. Is my fear and alarm regarding said things pathological? Thank you for your time. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps you are looking for the wrong words or ideas in the Prophets. <em>Natural death</em>, as you refer to it, is discussed within the Torah and also, as you request, in the Prophets.</p>\n\n<p><em>Natural death</em> is associated with the term הריסה, which is from the root הרס. It is often translated as <em>destruction</em>, but is more accurately understood as the concept of <em>decay</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Decay, death and destruction are natural parts of G-d's creation as we all experience it now. It is part of the balanced universe and isn't something to fear because as the creation is currently, it is necessary and part of G-d's bestowal of good to all things.</p>\n\n<p>To put that in context, think of any balanced and properly functioning ecosystem. The cycle of destruction and death, meaning predation and the consumption of material food to meet ones needs is normal and necessary. All life depends upon that cycle. When that cycle gets out of balance, meaning excess in one direction or another, then the ecosystem is sick and there is an overall reduction of life.</p>\n\n<p>Like we are all taught by Moses in Deuteronomy 30:19, we are always to choose what results in life.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I call as witness upon you this day heaven and earth [(They endure forever, and if evil befall you, they will testify that I forewarned you of all this.)] The life and the death have I set before you, the blessing and the curse, and [I urge you to] choose the life, so that you live, you and your seed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that said, it is important to understand that our Prophets teach us that G-d's creation will not remain like this forever. That principle of destruction that we experience now will ultimately be eliminated by G-d. This is associated with the coming of Moshiach and the final redemption. And that is what is found in Amos 9:11 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא אָקִ֛ים אֶת־סֻכַּ֥ת דָּוִ֖יד הַנֹּפֶ֑לֶת וְגָדַרְתִּ֣י אֶת־פִּרְצֵיהֶ֗ן וַהֲרִֽסֹתָיו֙ אָקִ֔ים וּבְנִיתִ֖יהָ כִּימֵ֥י עוֹלָֽם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>In that day, I will set up again the fallen booth of David: I will\n  mend its breaches and set up its ruins anew. I will build it firm as\n  in the days of old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is how Maimonides explains it in his commentary to Mishnah Sanhedrin, chapter 10:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"How great is Your good that You have hidden for those that fear You.\" And so, they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"In the world to come there is no eating and no drinking and no bathing and no anointing and no intercourse, but rather the righteous ones sit and their crowns are upon their heads and they derive pleasure from the radiance of the Divine Presence.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding your last question, \"<em>Is my fear and alarm regarding said things pathological?</em>\", meaning caused by or related to mental or physical illness.</p>\n\n<p>This seems off topic because of its personal nature and would be something you should discuss with your own local health professional.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Ehrlich felt that the ancient Israelites did not believe in heaven or hell. The ancients probably felt that the deceased descended into Sheol, which the Greeks called Hades. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Torah does not speak about life after death, heaven or hell. When people die they are sent to Sheol, which means \"grave.\" However, the Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 90b cites Numbers 31:16, Moses will \"lie with his ancestors.\" However, arguably this phrase is an idiom, Moses will join his ancestors when he died as they died. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Midrash says that Moses cried when he was told he was about to die. If there is life after death, and if the Oral Torah emphasized this, and if Moses knew this, why did he cry? Be it as it may, this midrashic tale is not in the Bible.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -9)\n\n<p>You ask a good question, one in which scholars have been asking for centuries. Unfortunately for some,  and this will bother many people, the Bible does not mention life after death.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Torah is silent in matters of heaven, hell, or garden of Eden. Daniel 12 does not speak about the resurrection or life after death, but the revival of Judaism. Daniel may have lived around the time of the Maccabean revolt. When he is told to “rest\" it means to have patience and the wise are Jews who follow Judaism rather than Hellenism. They are told to “awake,” meaning to rise to rebellion against the Syrian Greeks. He is assured that they will be among the victors in the “end of days.” This interpretation seems more appropriate with the historical context. </p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew term \"sheol\" means nothing more than the grave. When Jacob cries that the death of his son will lead him into sheol in Genesis 37:35, he is saying that the depressing will kill him. Sheol means a grave, nothing more. Also, the phrase olam haba is not in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the modern Hebrew word for “soul” is nefesh today, but in biblical Hebrew nefesh did not denote \"soul,\" rather it meant “a person,” or a “life force.” Thus, the Bible is silent about the modern concept of a soul. In his essay called Chelek Maimonides seems to say that God does not reward and punish people after death. Rather, the person’s intellect joins (or gets absorbed into) an active intellect. Thus, there are no souls after death, only intellects.</p>\n\n<p>Although most people feel uncomfortable when they do not know something that\nis important to them, I think the answer is that we simply do not know and\nmay never know.</p>\n\n\n",

Can the second person, who has already fulfilled <em>kiddush</em>, use my blessing for the wine he wishes to drink now?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a similar case in the Gemara (Berachos 48) regarding Shimon ben Shetach and King Yannai. It seems from that using the principle of <em>arvus</em> (the principle that allows me to bless on behalf of someone else even when I am not blessing for myself), Shimon ben Shetach would have been able to discharge the obligation of Yannai and his wife.</p>\n\n<p>The Tzlach (Berachos 20) attempted to prove from here that <em>arvus</em> applies even to women (at the very least, from a man to a woman), which is contrary to his understanding of a Rosh who seems to posit that women are excluded from <em>arvus</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Tzlach refutes his own proof with the following answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולי כיון שעכ\"פ אכלו ינאי וחביריו כדי שביעה ונתחייבו מן התורה, ושמעון\n  בן שטח הוא ערב דכל ישראל ערבים זה בזה, שוב נקרא שמעון בן שטח ג\"כ\n  מחוייב מן התורה ומוציא את הנשים אף שאינו ערב בעדם דאתי דאורייתא ומפיק\n  דאורייתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, the Tzlach suggests that as long as the principle of <em>arvus</em> is activated on behalf of one person [in that context, for Yannai], even women (who do not have <em>arvus</em> on their own accord) can be discharged by listening to this blessing. (See also Shu\"t R' Akiva Eiger #7, where R' Shlomo Eiger suggests the same idea)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, once <em>arvus</em> can be applied to this blessing for the listener who is fulfilling his obligation of Kiddush, anyone else can join along.</p>\n\n<p>(The Tzlach himself seems to disregard this logic in a different piece (Berachos 48), and IIRC there is a proof that R' Akiva Eiger did not agree with this.)</p>\n\n\n",

This was the [basis for] the culpability of the people of Yavesh Gilead, as well as of Yonasan, whose father said to him, \"So may G-d do, and more so, for you, Yonasan, must die\" (Shmuel 1:14:44). Now, on what basis would any of them have been legally subject to capital punishment? Only from this verse...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

According to the Christians, the Original Sin is wiped out by Jesus if the person has faith in him. Judaism also rejects this notion.</p>\n\n\n",

When it was time for him to change into a wolf, as it says, “Benjamin is a predatory wolf,” as long as he was with his father, he could rely upon a physician, and in that merit he did not change into a wolf. For thus it says, “And he shall leave his father and die” (Gen. 44:22)—namely, that when he separates from his father, and turns into a wolf with travelers, whoever finds him will kill him. (Rabbeinu Ephraim, commentary to Genesis 44:29)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a type of wolf that is called loup-garou (werewolf), which is a person that changes into a wolf. When it changes into a wolf, his feet emerge from between his shoulders. So too with Benjamin—“he dwells between the shoulders” (Deuteronomy 33:12). The solution for [dealing with] this wolf is that when it enters a house, and a person is frightened by it, he should take a firebrand and thrust it around, and he will not be harmed. So they would do in the Temple; each day, they would throw the ashes by the altar, as it is written, “and you shall place it by the altar” (Leviticus 6:3); and so is the norm with this person whose offspring turn into wolves, for a werewolf is born with teeth, which indicates that it is out to consume the world. Another explanation: a werewolf is born with teeth, to show that just as this is unusual, so too he will be different from other people. And likewise, Benjamin ate his mother, who died on his accord, as it is written, “And it was as her soul left her, for she was dying, and she called his name ‘the son of my affliction’ ” (Genesis 35:18). (Commentary to Genesis 35:27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know the Chida mentions this in the name of Rabbeinu Ephraim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Devash_Lefi%2C_Letter_Zayin?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dvash Lefi, letter Zayin, 15-16</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a wolf called loupgarou (werewolf) and he is a man and changes into a wolf, and at the hour of his chaging to a wolf, his legs come out of his shoulders, so Binyamin \"dwelleth between his shoulders.\"[...] Rabbeinu Ephraim z\"l in his commentary to the Torah [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From here it sounds like the Chida understands this idea as being literally true (at least according to Rabbeinu Ephraim).</p>\n\n<p>However, in the next paragraph he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A wolf that turns into a man, even while he changes into a man, during every hour he has a tail, so was the strip of land that came out of the property of Binyamin and entered into the property of Yehudah and upon it was the Beit Hamikdash.[...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From here it sounds like a parable, though.\nHowever, in Rabbeinu Ephraim's words it sounds like he literally thought Binyamin was a werewolf. I know some people would say that he was saying this based on the popular myths and beliefs of the time - and I can accept that about commentaries on werewolves in general. It's equally possible, in my opinion, that there may actually be such creatures - the Talmud and even the Tanach are filled with descriptions about fantastical creatures and demonic beings (such as shedim) - so I don't think it's too far-fetched to say that in the past, when the world was more spiritual, and such creatures were more widely-seen, wolf-monsters could've also been around.</p>\n\n<p>However, I don't know how either of these explanations reconcile with Rabbeinu Ephraim's belief that Binyamin, of all people, was a werewolf (and that he ate his mother!). That just seems too extreme to me.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any explanation for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I’ve completely edited my answer.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the options I see:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky said (according to one of the comments on Rabbi Slifkin's post, he was sent this commentary over 20 years ago):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זה מסודי התורה  - This is from the secrets (Sod) of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>Based on Rabbi Mendel Kaplan’s class (which can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/2807492/jewish/Why-Benjamin-Was-in-Imminent-Threat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/2807492/jewish/Why-Benjamin-Was-in-Imminent-Threat.htm</a>), it appears to be based on a lost midrash. The basis for this assumption comes from Yaakov’s seemingly irrational and way over-the-top and completely-certain fear that his son Binyamin will be in grave danger if he leaves his side (\"וקרהו אסון\") – yet doesn’t hold the same fears with regards to his other sons, and these seemingly odd fears are further asserted in Yehudah's speech to Yosef in the beginning of Miketz.\nThe answer, according to this lost midrash brought by Rabbeinu Ephraim is that Binyamin was in constant danger of changing back into wolf form, with the only person that was able to cure him without the need to spill blood being his father. If he were to leave his father's side and transform, he'd run off and be killed by the first person who meets him, as all wild and dangerous animals are killed.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Ramban criticized this, [in the Responsa of Rashba\n  attributed to Ramban, #284] based on the fact that Caleb, Gideon and\n  other great men of Israel all took pilagshim; and if the pilegesh of\n  Giv'ah [Judges 20] was forbidden, he would not have said publically\n  before all Israel \"My pilegesh\" [ibid. verse 4], and would not have\n  gone publically to her father. But Rambam implicitly replied to this\n  by writing, that a person who is not a king is permitted only to take\n  an “amah ivriyah”, and would explain that such was the case re all the\n  above [commoners who took pilagshim]”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to HaGra, therefore, if I have not misunderstood, for Rambam the pilagshim mentioned in the Tanakh as partners of Jewish commoners would all be examples of amah ivriyah designated by her master (see Smemot 21: 7-11). However, I did not understand if this interpretation is the result of HaGra's brilliant solution aimed at reconciling Rambam's position with the references in the Tanakh to the pilagshim taken by Jewish commoners, or if we actually have textual evidences, in Jewish sources, about the fact that an \"amah ivriyah\" designated by  her master was called a pilegesh, and especially if the pilagshim taken by Jewish commoners, which are spoken of in the Tanakh, were all cases of amah ivriyah designated by his master (it does not seem to me that the Tanakh and the Talmud express themselves in this sense, but obviously I am ignorant of the Jewish tradition as a whole)</p>\n\n\n",

If the transgressor does not listen, then the speaker should alert the public of the individual’s guilt. (In a case where the speaker knows in advance that the transgressor won’t listen to rebuke, we will discuss it IY”H in paragraph 7.)\n4-The description of the sin should not be exaggerated [for “effect” or any other reason].\n5-The speaker must have pure intentions (“to’elet,” lit. “purpose”).

Hisda said to R. Isaac: What blessing is said over this balsam-oil? — He replied: Thus said Rab Judah: 'Who createst the oil of our land', He then said to him: Leaving out Rab Judah, who dotes on the Land of Israel, what do ordinary people say? — He replied: Thus said R. Johanan: 'Who createst pleasant oil'.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_43.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently Rav Yehuda loved the Land of Israel so much that it caused him to change the text of a blessing, and we therefore cannot cite him as evidence. Yet some twenty pages earlier (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=24b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 24b</a>) we find the following about Rav Yehuda:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי אבא הוה קא משתמיט מיניה דרב יהודה דהוה קא בעי למיסק לארעא דישראל דאמר רב יהודה כל העולה מבבל לא\"י עובר בעשה שנאמר בבלה יובאו ושמה יהיו עד יום פקדי אותם נאם ה</p>\n<p>R. Abba kept away from Rab Judah because he wanted to go up to Eretz Israel; for Rab Judah said, Whoever goes up from Babylon to Eretz Israel transgresses a positive precept, since it says, They shall be carried to Babylon and there shall they be, until the day that I remember them, saith the Lord.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_24.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it meant to be ironic that the very <em>amora</em> who loved Israel so much is the one who holds that it is forbidden to go up to Israel?</p>\n<p>Is this a mere coincidence?</p>\n<p>Was one of these in some way the cause the other?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%99_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9A_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Tzvi Elimelech of Dinov</a> in his commentary to the passage on 43b writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהראוי להתבונן מהיכן שפט זה דר\"י אמר כך משום חביבות א\"י שהיה לו ביותר מכל העולם וגם אם תלוי הדבר בחביבות א\"י הנה אם יארע עוד איש שיקר בעיניו חביבות א\"י ישתנה הדין ויברך כמו שברך ר\"י וזה לא שמענו מעולם ונראה דאמר כן משום דר\"י ס\"ל כל העולה מבבל לא\"י עובר בעשה דכתיב בבלה יבואו ושמה יהיו עד יום וכו' אע\"ג דההוא קרא בכלים כתיב הנה ר\"י לקח אותו לאסמכתא וטעמיה משום חביבות א\"י דאין מהראוי לאדם להשתדל לעלות לא\"י ולראות אותה בחורבנה וכד מנוולא נפשה לגבי שבאי עד אשר יפקדנה הש\"י ונראה אותה ככלה תעדה כליה הנך רואה מה יקר בעיני ר\"י שבחא דא\"י עד שאסר לראות אותה רק בשבחה ובקישוטיה משא\"כ אנן דלא קיי\"ל כותיה בזה אין לפסוק כן</p>\n<p>It is proper to understand whence he judged this that Rav Yehuda said this because of his love of the Land of Israel that was more than the rest of the world. And even if the matter is dependent on love of the Land of Israel, behold if it occurred [that there was] another man for which Israel was so beloved in his eyes then the law would change and he [too] would bless as Rav Yehuda blessed. But this we have never heard!</p>\n<p>It would appear that he said this because Rav Yehuda holds that anyone who ascends from Babylon to the Land of Israel violates a positive commandment, as it is written (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1127.htm#22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jeremiah 27:22</a>) \"They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day etc.\" Even though the verse is talking about vessels, Rav Yehuda took it as an allusion. And his reason was [his] love of the Land of Israel, for it is not proper for a person to strive to ascend to the Land of Israel and to see it in its ruin and disgraced by her captors, until God will remember her and she will appear as a bride adorned with her ornaments.</p>\n<p>Behold you see how precious the praise of the Land of Israel was in the eyes of Rav Yehuda, to the point that he forbade seeing it except in its praise and adornment. As opposed to us who don't hold like him in this [regarding going to the Land of Israel], we shouldn't rule like him [regarding the blessing].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Meir Simcha of Dvinsk</a> in his letter about Israel (included in the commentary made up of his various writings to the passage on 24b) similarly drew a connection between these two passages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמרו עליו שאני רב יהודה דחביבא ליה ארעא דישראל והיא הנסיבה כי אחרי שלא היה היכולת בידו לפי שיטתו בהלכה לעלות לארץ השתוקק תמיד להגות בארץ ולשים זכרונה על לבבו</p>\n<p>And they said of him \"Rav Yehuda is different because the Land of Israel is beloved to him\". And this was the circumstance that since he did not have the ability – according to his halachic ruling – to ascend to the land, he was always yearning to think about the land and to place its memory on his heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai said: That ear which heard on Mount Sinai, (Exodus 20:13) “Thou shalt not steal” and yet its owner went and stole and was therefore sold as a slave — let it be pierced! Or, in the case of him who sold himself from destitution, having committed no theft, the reason is: That ear which heard on Mount Sinai what I said, (Leviticus 25:55) “For unto Me the children Israel are servants” and yet its owner went and procured for himself another master — let it be pierced! (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 21:6:3; Kiddushin 22b). Rabbi Simeon interpreted this verse like a jewel (i. e. giving it an ethical signification): In what respect are door and doorpost different from all other objects in the house that they should be singled out for this purpose? God, in effect, said: door and doorpost that were eye-witnesses in Egypt when I passed over the lintel and the two doorposts, freeing Israel from slavery, and when I said, (Leviticus 25:55) “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants” — servants to Me but not servants of servants (of human beings), and yet this man went and procured another master for himself — let him be pieced in their presence (i. e. let them be eye-witnesses now when this man voluntarily prolongs his state of slavery)! (Kiddushin 22b.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then on the same verse writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOR EVER — This means until the Jubilee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given that lengthening one's servitude was greatly frowned upon, so much so that it seems to be a transgression of the whole concept of \"Eved Hashem\", would such a slave, once freed by the Yovel, need to do Tshuva on this?

    "content": "# Why do some editions of Sefer HaChinuch split Parashat Mishpatim in two?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've noticed that some editions of Sefer Hachinuch (such as <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40631&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Chavel's edition</a> based on the 1523 Venice edition) split Parashat Mishpatim into two sections. </p>\n\n<p>The first starts from <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40631&st=&pgnum=96&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the beginning of Parashat Mishpatim</a> and includes the 24 <em>mitzvot</em> until 'Im Kesef Talveh' (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 22:24</a>), and the second <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40631&st=&pgnum=119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">picks up from there</a> and lists the 29 <em>mitzvot</em> until the beginning of Parashat Terumah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why was it printed this way? Was there a variant Torah-reading practice that split (what we call) Parashat Mishpatim over two weeks?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Indeed there was such a custom. Traditionally, the Babylonian annual Torah reading cycle with which we are all familiar had four \"checkpoints\" to keep everyone roughly in sync: Nitzavim before Rosh Hashana, Devarim before Tisha Bav, Bamidbar before Shavuot, and Tzav before Pesach. If you were in a small town and didn't have a calendar, as long as you doubled up portions as necessary for those checkpoints you'd be ok and you wouldn't have to calculate too far ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Tzav before Pesach is not so practical during a leap year, so the checkpoint for leap years became Metzora. The mnemonic here is (OC 428:4) פקדו/סגרו ופסחו מנו ועצרו צומו וצלו קומו ותקעו.</p>\n\n<p>In years when Simchat Torah is just before Shabbat on Thursday, but Pesach starts after Shabbat on Sunday or Tuesday, there is that one extra Shabbat between them and we have to split something to hit the checkpoint. If that year is not a leap year, we split Vayakhel and Pekudei apart. If that year is a leap year, then Vayakhel-Pekudei and Tzaria-Metzora are already split and there is no other double parsha before Metzora to split. In that case, the common contemporary practice is to read Metzora two weeks before Pesach and Acharei Mot just before Pesach. The checkpoint fails, but what option is there?</p>\n\n<p>One option is two split a 'non-traditional' section from earlier over two weeks. In Provence, there was a practice to split Mishpatim in half, with the second week picking up at Im Kesef. This is the practice you see reflected in the Chinukh who lived in Provence. This custom is mentioned by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abudarham%2C_Hebrew_Calendar%2C_Order_of_Parashiot_and_Haftarot.82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avudarham</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes, that is correct. There was a variant practice that split Parshat Mishpatim into two Parshiot. I saw that explained in the commentary on the Sefer HaChinuch.</p>\n\n\n",

You might think the resulting wound is considered a שחין, because a שחין is the result of a blow. On the other hand, you might think it's a מכוה, because a מכוה is the result of the application of a heated object. (These — שחין and מכוה — are categories of wound in the laws of צרעת.) So which is it: שחין or מכוה‎?</p>\n<p>The <em>g'mara</em> immediately counters:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למאי נפקא מינה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And <em>Rashi</em> explains the question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>באיזה דבר חלוק דין מכוה משחין דתיבעי לך</p>\n<p>In what matter is the rule of מכוה different from שחין, that you're asking [whether a heated-spit wound is מכוה or שחין‎]?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't understand why <em>Rashi</em> explains this here. There must be hundreds of similar \"למאי נפקא מינה\" lines throughout the <em>Bavli</em> that have much the same meaning this one does—</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In what matter is the rule of … different from … (that you're asking whether/telling that something is one of them)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— and <em>Rashi</em> doesn't explain the question. (For example, <em>Chulin</em> 87 <em>amud</em> 1, \"ליתן לו עשרה זהובים איבעיא להו שכר מצוה או שכר ברכה למאי נפקא מינה\"; <em>Shabas</em> 20–21, \"שעוה פסולתא דדובשא למאי נפקא מינה\".) Why does <em>Rashi</em> explain it here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>From my own understanding of Rashi:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara chose to express the initial question by saying \"<strong>Do we judge</strong>\" this wound as a \"blow\" or \"burn\"??</p>\n\n<p>As soon as the Gemara says \"Do we judge\", then the famous phrase of \"L'mai Nafka Minah\"? למאי נפקא מינה , is inappropriate (at least according to its usual usage).</p>\n\n<p>The average student of the Talmud is used to seeing L'mai Nafka Minah? (What would be the practical case of a difference?) as used when the Gemara admits (or has no argument with) the statement offered. Rather, the Gemara accepts the statement just offered; and then asks anyway: \"So even if I accept what you just said...in what case would there be a practical application of a difference in Law?</p>\n\n<p>Here, The Gemara just said that there is such a thing as the \"Din\" or Law of a \"blow\" as opposed to the law of a \"burn\". If so, then we would not ask \"what practical difference is there\" because the obvious difference is if we judge the heated spit injury under the law of a blow or burn! So we should not be asking \"L'mai nafka minah\" at all over here!</p>\n\n<p>So Rashi is explaining to the student of the Talmud that here is an exceptional case of usage for the question \"L'mai nafka minah\"?</p>\n\n<p>Here the phrase is used as a direct argument against what the Gemara has just tried to pass off as simple and accepted. It is actually a direct objection:</p>\n\n<p>\"Wait a minute Rabbis! What could possibly be the practical difference between any \"law\" of a blow vs the \"law\" of a burn?? In both cases, the perpetrator would be liable for the same damages anyway (as opposed to say for example, when a thief steals a sheep or an ox. One pays 4 times the sheep's value or 5 times the ox's value. By blow vs burn, there is no difference. There isn't even any difference regarding the laws of Tzaraas either (at first glance)).</p>\n\n<p>Then the gemara had to explain itself that there is in fact a case where classifying a blow or burn makes a difference in law.</p>\n\n<p>Since the average student of the Talmud would have been confused by this uncommon usage of \"L'mai nafka minah\", Rashi had to spell it out and explain it.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are Jewish conjoined twins permitted to marry?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Being that it is forbidden to marry siblings may conjoined twins marry? Are they considered siblings or one person?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In 1977, Rav Moshe Feinstein ruled on a case of conjoined twins who were joined from the shoulder to the pelvis and shared a single six-chambered heart. I don't believe that his responsum was published by himself; however, I have seen multiple pages on the internet that cite a 1977 Philadelphia Inquirer article about his ruling (including <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/assia_english/halperin2-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>, which I'm using as a basis for my summary because I do not have access to the article itself). Their condition was life-threatening to both of the twins to the extent that they would both almost certainly die if they were not separated. However, separating the twins would certainly cause the death of one of them.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe ruled that the twins may be separated, resulting in one of their deaths. He used two analogies to support his decision:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodef\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rodef (pursuer)</a></li>\n<li>A case given in the Yerushalmi where bandits demand that a group of Jews hand over a particular Jew to be killed. The ruling there according to Reish Lakish (which is how we pasken for practical halakha), is that handing over the one designated Jew is permitted so the rest will not be killed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Both of these analogies clearly assume that the conjoined twins are two separate people. If conjoined twins were considered one person in halakha, he would not need to go to such analogies because nobody would be killed by separating them. Given that they are separate people, <strong>it is clear that two female conjoined twins could not marry one man</strong> because one man may not marry two sisters. Likewise, two male conjoined twins could not both marry one woman since a woman may not marry two men at all (regardless of whether they are siblings).</p>\n\n\n",

MB 73 writes this is l’chatchila, but b’diavad, there is no insistence on it.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, it seems that the tzitzis are tied tightly to the talis so that they won’t slip from the length of the talis.

The purpose of the thread would be to anchor the tzitzis to the talis so they don’t drop down.</p>\n\n<p>In the picture, I've drawn where a thread could be sewn to just anchor the tzitzis in one spot.

We can see this by looking at the secular, non-religious, anti-religious, and <em>heterodox streams</em> of Jews and seeing what has happened to them.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the people who followed Avraham and Sarah, the <em>souls that they made</em>, and who disappeared over the next two generations. Only Yaakov and the 12 shvatim continued. As Rashi says, 80% of the Bnai Yisrael never made it out of Mitzrayim. Rabbi Beryl Wein points out that the Jews at one time comprised 10% of the Roman Empire and equaled the population of China.</p>\n\n<p>While you ask what is the hashkafah reason that we are so few, the main answer seems to be that people cannot bring themselves to struggle and strive to serve Hashem and will rationalize their attempts to move farther away.</p>\n\n<p>Even when we had open miracles, Hashem allowed us the freedom of choice to decide what path we would go on.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1904352/jewish/Why-Is-the-Jewish-People-So-Small.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Jonathan Sacks</a> explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The period in question was the first-century Roman empire. Jews\n  numbered some 10 percent of the empire, and there were many Romans who\n  admired aspects of their faith and way of life. The pagan deities of\n  the Hellenistic world were losing their appeal and plausibility, and\n  throughout the centers of the Mediterranean, individuals were adopting\n  Jewish practices. Two aspects of Judaism stood in their way: the\n  commandments and circumcision. In the end, Jews chose not to\n  compromise their way of life for the sake of making converts. The\n  Hellenistic people who sympathized with Judaism mostly adopted Pauline\n  Christianity instead. Consistently throughout history, Jews have\n  chosen to be true to themselves and to stay small rather than make\n  concessions for the sake of increasing numbers.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why have divine providence or human choice, or both, eventuated in the\n  sheer smallness of the Jewish people? Could it be, quite simply, that\n  through the Jewish people G‑d is telling humankind that you do not\n  need to be numerous to be great. Nations are judged not by their size,\n  but by their contribution to the human heritage. Of this, the most\n  compelling proof is that a nation as small as the Jews could produce\n  an ever-renewed flow of prophets, priests, poets, philosophers, sages,\n  saints, halachists, aggadists, codifiers, commentators, rebbes and\n  heads of yeshivot; that they could also yield some of the world’s\n  greatest writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, academics,\n  intellectuals, doctors, lawyers, businesspeople and technological\n  innovators. Out of all proportion to their numbers, Jews could and can\n  be found working as lawyers fighting injustice, economists fighting\n  poverty, doctors fighting disease, and teachers fighting ignorance.</p>\n  \n  <p>You do not need numbers to enlarge the spiritual and moral horizons of\n  humankind. You need other things altogether: a sense of the worth and\n  dignity of the individual, of the power of human possibility to\n  transform the world, of the importance of giving everyone the best\n  education they can have, of making each of us feel part of a\n  collective responsibility to ameliorate the human condition, and a\n  willingness to take high ideals and enact them in the real world,\n  unswayed by disappointments and defeats.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nowhere is this more in evidence today than among the people of Israel\n  in Israel: traduced in the media and pilloried by much of the world,\n  yet still, year after year, producing human miracles in medicine,\n  agriculture, technology and the arts, as if the word “impossible” did\n  not exist in the Hebrew language. When, therefore, we feel fearful and\n  depressed about Israel’s plight, it is worth returning to Moses’\n  words: “The L‑rd did not set his affection on you and choose you\n  because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you are the\n  fewest of all peoples.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Small? Yes. Still surrounded, as the Israelites were then, by “nations\n  larger and stronger than you.” But that small people, defying the laws\n  of history, outlived all the world’s great empires, and still has a\n  message of hope for humanity. You don’t have to be large to be great.\n  If you are open to a power greater than yourself, you will become\n  greater than yourself. Israel today still carries that message to the\n  world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Religion is a personal choice. </p>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is that in today's age, it is more common for a Jewish person to choose a secular lifestyle than a religious one. </p>\n\n<p>Without getting too political, a secular lifestyle is simply easier. Less laws, less time devotion, less focus on the afterlife and the future. A secular lifestyle is all about the present and enjoying the physical world, which is attractive to many people.</p>\n\n<p>Also due to many years of persecution, a lot of Jewish people find that they are persecuted less when they blend in with their non-Jewish neighbors. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your question. I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to ask.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>You seem to be asking two questions. Why are so many Jews secular and non-observant and why are we a small nation. It is impossible to answer the second question if we do not employ practical reasons,\nsuch exile, persecution, the need not to proselytize, intermarriage, etc. Perhaps one reason could be traced to the fact the conversion as a practice did not exist in ancient Judaism. Other answers may consist that Jew do not believe in hell like the Christians, who, therefore saw a need to convert folk. Obviously, the anti-semitism harmed and killed many Jews throughout history, preventing our growth and development as a nation; and yet we are on top of the world in terms of the entertainment business, art, literature, science, military, etc. </p>\n\n<p>To answer your first question, I think Rabbi Marc Shapiro answered this well when he writes that Jews today are unwilling to accept that the world is 5000yrs old, Noah’s flood, demons, astrology and many other notions that sound unlikely, if not impossible to occur. Since people are more educated about their past, people are unwilling to throw away history, archeologists and scientific finds, etc etc. For example, most people can no longer believe that all of humanity was descended from Noah and animals that inhabit places like Australia and the rain forest could not have traveled there from Turkey, much less survive in a hot desert region prior to the flood. If we do accept these notions without evidence, on blind faith, then we are rejecting history that says the contrary. I agree with the Modern Orthodox position and that of Marc Shapiro, that Jews do not have to take the biblical stories literally. Indeed the Rambam understood the garden of Eden story allegorically and Rabbi Kook said that it makes no difference whether or not such a place ever existed. Those traditionalist and fundamentialist who do take the Bible literally do so primarily because they reject modern science and history.</p>\n\n<p>But Judaism does not teach us to suspend our intellect. True, G-d could have created the world 5000yrs ago or, 30 minutes ago, for that matter, implanting all our memories. And yes, G-d could have held Mount Sinai over the heads of three million Jews, but our commentators never said that we must believe in these things in order to be good Torah-observant Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism survived copernicus (Rabbi Slifkin says that virtually all of the rabbis reject his view at first), evolution, the age of the universe, etc etc. and so Rabbi Shapiro, and myself included, are convinced that Judaism will continue to exist. What “type” of Judaism is disputed, but I like to think, based on the evidence provided, that a form of \"rational religion\"will prevail. </p>\n\n<p>In short, I think the reason most Jews are secular today is simply because they are not exposed to Rational Judaism. But when they are, as is to be expected, I think the number of religious adherents will increase, or so I hope.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, not only in the old (walled) city of Jerusalem is Purim celebrated on the 15th, but even all neighborhoods that are near the old city. And even though the city has expanded greatly, since each neighborhood is near he next neighborhood, they all follow the old city, and read on the 15th.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there's a neighborhood which is not near (within 141 1/3 Amos of) the next neighborhood, then there's a machlokes: some say it is not considered Jerusalem, anx should read on the 14th, while others say that as long as they are considered part of Jerusalem for tax purposes, and <em>kal v'chomer</em> if they have the same eiruv, they are considered part of Jerusalem and should read on the 15th. (This is how Rabbi Massass, and Rabbi Kulitz [the Sefardi and Ashkenazi chief Rabbis of Yerushalayim] paskened, so this is what most people do).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>See the footnote in the peninei halacha for a full explanation, but basically: there's an argument in the rishonim whether 'near, but not visible' is a mil (2000 Amos), because then they are considered reliant on the city; or 'ibbur ha'ir' (70 2/3 Amos from each neighborhood, i.e. 141 1/3 Amos), because we don't want to differentiate in such a small area. There's a machlokes among the Achronim who the Shu\"A paskened like. The Mishna Berura paskened like the first opinion, but the Yabia Omer said to be cstreful of the second one.</p>\n<p>Another question raised is whether to measure 'seeing the city' from the walls of the city, or from the expansion of the city (which is apparently what most of the rishonim hold).</p>\n<p>Therefore, many of the recent Achronim (RSZA, Rav Avraham Shapiro, Rav Massass, Rav Kulitz, Rav Mordechai Eliyahu, Rav Yisraeli) held that we go by the opinion that 'as long as you're reliant on the city, you're part of it', and if a neighborhood pays taxes to Jerusalem, its part of Jerusalem. Even if they don't pay taxes to Jerusalem, RSZA said that if they have the same eiruv it still counts. Another reason to Pasken this way is based on the rishonim who hold that 'near and visible' is from the outskirts of the city, in which case most neighborhoods around Jerusalem are considered 'visible'.</p>\n<p>The opposing Achronim (rav ovadia, Chazon ish, rav tzvi Pesach frank, the Or l'Tzion) held that if there are 141 1/3 Amos of empty land from the outskirts of Jerusalem, the following neighborhood is no longer part of Jerusalem. However, even those holding of this opinion said that Giv'at Shaul (which is [was?] more than 141 1/3 Amos away from Jerusalem proper, but completely reliant on Jerusalem) should read on the the 15th.</p>\n<p>The question of 'what happens if there are no Jews living in the true old city of Jerusalem?' (Loewian's point in the comments) is also addressed, and although it's a machlokes, the general consensus is that we read on the 15th anyway. (This was said even when the old city was in Jordanian hands, and there were definitely no Jews living there. <em>Kal vechomer</em> when there are Jews living in most of the area, but we're not sure exactly which part was the walled city).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>One of the big Nafka Minos between the two opinions is the neighborhood of Mevaseret Yerushalayim, which is semi-reliant on Jerusalem, and further than 141 1/3 Amos away. There, as well as in a few other neighbourhoods, some read on the 14th, some read on both (while saying a bracha on one of the two days), and most read on the 15th, in accordance with the chief Rabbis of Jerusalem's ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Source of the Noahide Laws",
    "content": "# Source of the Noahide Laws\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.56a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 56a-b</a>, gives the Noahide laws, applicable to all mankind:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: Seven precepts were the sons of Noah commanded: To establish courts of justice; and refrain from blasphemy, idolatry, adultery, murder, stealing, and eating the flesh of live animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It then explains that these laws are derived from a single line in Genesis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the Lord God commanded the man saying, ‘of every tree of the garden you may freely eat’. [Gen. 2:16]  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is how:</p>\n\n<p>-“Establish courts of justice” is derived from “And the Lord God commanded”, because “command” relates to justice and judgment.</p>\n\n<p>-“No blasphemy” is derived from the words “The Lord”, which are used in connection with blasphemy in Leviticus: \"And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death.\" [Lev. 24:16] </p>\n\n<p>-“No idolatry” is derived from the word “God”, because the word “God” is used in that context in Exodus: \"You shall have no other gods before Me. \"[Ex. 20:3] </p>\n\n<p>-“No murder” is derived from “the man”, because the word “man” is used in that context in Genesis: \"Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\" [Gen. 9:6]</p>\n\n<p>-“No adultery” is derived from the word “saying”, because it used in that context in Jeremiah: \"They say, ‘If a man puts away his wife, and she go from him, and became another man's…’\"[Jer. 3:1] </p>\n\n<p>-“No stealing” is derived from “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat”.  Since it was necessary to authorize Adam to eat of the trees of the garden, it follows that without such authorization it was forbidden, since the trees did not belong to him.</p>\n\n<p>-“No eating flesh from live animals” is derived from “You may freely eat”, because it implies “You may eat only what is ready for eating, which is not the case while the animal is alive.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this the ONLY source for the Noahide laws?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I ask because, considering their universality and their importance, it is puzzling that they have to be derived in such a contrived manner, instead of being spelled out directly in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>See R. Yehuda Halevi's Kuzari (3:73) where he writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rabbi: Let us rather assume two other possibilities. Either they employ secret methods of interpretation which we are unable to\n  discern, and which were handed down to them, together with the method\n  of the 'Thirteen Rules of Interpretation,' or they use Biblical verses\n  as a kind of fulcrum of interpretation in a method called <em>Asmakhtā</em>,\n  and make them a sort of hall mark of tradition. An instance is given\n  in the following verse: 'And the Lord God commanded the man, saying,\n  Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat' (Gen. ii. 16 sq.).\n  It forms the basis of the 'seven Noahide laws' in the following\n  manner: </p>\n  \n  <p>['He] commanded' refers to jurisdiction.\n  'The Lord' refers to prohibition of blasphemy.\n  'God' refers to prohibition of idolatry.\n  'The man' refers to prohibition of murder.\n  'Saying' refers to prohibition of incest.\n  'Of every tree of the garden,' prohibition of rape.\n  'Thou mayest surely eat,' a prohibition of flesh from the living animal.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>There is a wide difference between these injunctions and the verse. The people, however, accepted these seven laws as tradition, connecting them with the verse as aid to memory.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Hebrew translation is clearer in stating that this verse is not the actual source for the laws: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כמה רחוק בין אלו העניינים ובין הפסוק הזה, אך אצל העם קבלה משבע המצוות\n  האלה, סומכין אותה בפסוק הזה בסימן שמיקל עליהם זכרם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Hil. Melachim 9:1) also does not refer to this source (ויצו). Instead he writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַל שִׁשָּׁה דְּבָרִים נִצְטַוָּה אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן. עַל עֲבוֹדָה\n  זָרָה. וְעַל בִּרְכַּת הַשֵּׁם. וְעַל שְׁפִיכוּת דָּמִים. וְעַל\n  גִּלּוּי עֲרָיוֹת. וְעַל הַגֵּזֶל. וְעַל הַדִּינִים. <strong>אַף עַל פִּי\n  שֶׁכֻּלָּן הֵן קַבָּלָה בְּיָדֵינוּ מִמּשֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ. וְהַדַּעַת\n  נוֹטָה לָהֶן. מִכְּלַל דִּבְרֵי תּוֹרָה יֵרָאֶה שֶׁעַל אֵלּוּ\n  נִצְטַוָּה</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>No, there are no sources for it in the Bible. Surprising as it may sound, the Bible does not mention these commands, known as the Seven Noahide Laws, which the rabbis later wrote down around 200 C.E.. In fact, these laws would practically go unnoticed in Jewish literature until the third century C.E. </p>\n\n<p>Although there is no source for this, these laws are explicable in nature and could be considered the basic laws of humanity, applicable to all human beings. The seven Noahide commandments are mentioned in the Tosefta, as in the Mishnah and Midrashim, as part of the “Oral Torah,” the unwritten parts of the Torah and in some instances reflect the halakhah. Interestingly, Professor Shamma Friedman has proven that Tosefta predates the Mishnah. </p>\n\n<p>The question – why would non-Jews want to know the divine origin of the commands? – if only the goal was to perform the commands in and of itself. If this is so, why should people dwell on whether or not G-d gave these commandments? However, if the goal is more than an additional stipulation, the question makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>In respect to Talmud, in Sanhedrin 56a-b, I think it is as the Talmud often states, hanging by a thread. Indeed, the Talmud states that many of its laws are like \"mountains hanging by a thread\" (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 5a). The Talmud, in this instance, is using the popular form of derash, or a kind of derasha, which is reading something into the text that is not there or explicit. Something that actually runs contrary to the plain meaning of the text. Thus, this is a perfect example of post-biblical laws with no real basis in the Torah, they are, as the Talmud says, hanging on it by a thread. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are the claims of this rabbi regarding the Messiah considered credible by Jews\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So, I just saw a <a href=\"https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/145395/israels-top-rabbi-im-currently-in-discussions-with-the-messiah-himself/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">news article</a> purporting that Rabbi Yaakov Zissholtz, labelled by the article as Israel's \"top rabbi\", claims to know members of the Thirty Six Tzaddikim as well as the Messiah, and that he claims the Messiah will be revealed shortly.</p>\n\n<p>This seems dubious to me, but I'm not Jewish. What I want to know is if this guy and his claims are considered credible by the typical Jewish person. Is he a crank running some minor cult-like sub-group, or is he actually a high-ranking rabbi who is widely respected by a major denomination of Jews? To use an allegory, is he more like Jim Jones or the Pope?</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from the man himself, have his claims garnered any significant backlash or criticism, or are they widely accepted among practicing Jews?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -10)\n\n<p>Many highly-respected rabbis believe (for many psychological reasons) that there will be a miraculous messiah who will save the world and that you will be resurrected, and that there will be a time when all evil will cease, etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, contrary to what many people think, the concept of a miraculous messiah is not biblical. In any event, Maimonides explains in Mishneh Torah, Law of Kings, chapters 11 and 12, that the messianic age will be a natural event. The human leader will die like all humans. Life at the time will be as it always has, except that Jews will live freely in the land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if Rabbi Yaakov Zissholtz says all the things you claim he sid, he is lying. Dr. Marc Shapiro's famous book The Limits of Orthodox Theology explains that Jews can believe whatever they want so long as they observe the rabbinical commands as the rabbis explained them. Thus, you do not need to believe him. The same applies to those who say that Jesus will return, Muhammad, the Buddha, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are some of my conclusions:</p>\n\n<p>Before criticizing Shadal, it is important to scrutinize the actual words of his letter to Rapoport.  Nowhere does he say that he shaves with a razor; nowhere does he admit to violating the normative halakhah in any specific way at all; nowhere does he even claim that Ibn Ezra himself would have advocated shaving with a razor or otherwise violating the halakhah.  What Shadal does say is merely that Ibn Ezra’s understanding of the peshat of Lev. 19:27—-that the prohibitions of that verse seem to be connected with mourning practices—-is at variance with the Rabbis’ authoritative interpretation, which does not limit these prohibitions to the mourning context.  So far, so good; Ibn Ezra’s exegetical method was in fact to examine the theoretical peshat of the Torah’s legal texts while at the same time accepting the Rabbinic halakhah in practice.  But then Shadal goes on to say that he does rely on Ibn Ezra’s understanding of the peshat to justify doing... something.  The question is, what?</p>\n\n<p>It is true that all depictions of Shadal show him as beardless (except for his nineteenth-century style sideburns).  However, even before the invention of the electric shaver in the twentieth century, the traditional straight razor was not the only means of removing one’s beard.  Alternative methods included depilatory creams or powders, which received halakhic approval from some authorities, but not from others.  Many Italian Jews from the seventeenth century onward removed their beards by such means, and Shadal himself may well have been one of them.  But it is possible that in light of the less than unanimous support for this practice among halakhic authorities, Shadal may have chosen to fall back on what he regarded as the peshat of Lev. 19:27 to justify his beardlessness, at least in his own mind—-after all, he was not removing his beard for mourning purposes.  And so perhaps this was all that he meant to “confess” privately to his friend Rabbi Rapoport: not that he invoked the peshat to defend his shaving with a razor (an activity uniformly recognized as halakhically forbidden), but that he invoked the peshat merely to defend removing his beard by other means (an activity that was at least arguably permitted under normative halakhah).  Under such a cautious reading of his words, Shadal’s  only “sin” would have been to invoke the peshat to begin with, an approach that even he would not normally have followed in interpreting practical halakhah.</p>\n\n<p>Such a reading, it might be argued, is not only cautious but far-fetched.  However, the alternative is no less difficult—-to conclude that a traditionalist figure like Shadal rejected a clear rule of halakhah.  Given the cryptic and ambiguous nature of Shadal’s statement, the record of his otherwise zealous advocacy of halakhic observance, and the fact that no one, to my knowledge, has ever yet unearthed evidence of any other such personal lapses on his part, it seems only fair to give him the benefit of the doubt (kaf zekhut) and read his statement so as to minimize any fault-finding or controversy.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud earlier (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=24b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24b</a>) provides a reason for this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המשמיע קולו בתפלתו הרי זה מקטני אמנה המגביה קולו בתפלתו הרי זה מנביאי השקר</p>\n<p>'One who says the Tefillah so that it can be heard is of the small of faith; he who raises his voice in praying is of the false prophets;</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_24.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאילו אין הקב\"ה שומע תפלת לחש ומגביה הרבה</p>\n<p>As if God does not hear quiet prayer, and he raises [his voice] much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see here that the <em>halacha</em> is aware of the theological implications of specific ways of praying, and seeks to avoid them.

However, this itself is in fact a matter of debate based on conflicting passages.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Since the Almighty is All-Knowing, why do we need to pray at all? He knows what's best for us. Based on Rav Hirsch's commentary on the word פלל - prayer/judging, we look at ourselves to see how we can develop our relationship to be more in sync with our Divine Mission. Perhaps praying out loud - enough that you yourself can hear it - will have a stronger effect on the purpose of prayer of waking us up enough to consider whether we're meeting our goals. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that G-d knows everything. Anything we or any cleric says G-d already knows. Torah readings what is called davening (praying) the Torah is important. In Hebrew prayer is lehitpaleil, and  root of lehitpaleil is p-l-l, which means “judge.” So the meaning of lehitpaleil is “to judge one’s self.” People do not need to say prayer verbally. They can do it while thinking, but saying it verbally helps them to remember their goals to improve.</p>\n\n\n",

The word Pharisees (prushim) was used in its ancient and original meaning also in Rabbinic literature, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Berakhot.3.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Brachot 3:25</a> \"Eighteen Berachot (blessings) that the Sages have established [for the prayer of Shemoneh Esreh have been established] corresponding to eighteen mentionings [of God’s name] that are in [the chapter of Tehillim that begins with] “Ascribe to God, children of princes…” (Tehillim 29) And [a person] should include [the Beracha against] the apostates into [the Beracha] of the heretics (<strong>prushin</strong>)<sup>1</sup>...\" in the parallel source in the Yerushalmi (Brachot 2:4) \"and it was taught in a baraita \"and [a person] should include [the bracha] of the apostates and that of the evil men in \"Subduer of the insolent\"...in my poor understanding, it seems that the Tosefta's version is the most correct version, and that one must say here \"Pharisees\" (prushim), because it would be hard to believe that the scribe, who found in his manuscript the version of \"sinners\" in that baraita, erased it and wrote instead \"Pharisees\" (prushim)...therefore we must explain that the word Pharisees means \"externals\"...from here we learn that the in the past, the term Pharisees was used per the meaning of heretics, even in the time of the Tannaim...and from this we may further lean that the sect of the Pharisees were called by this title by their cursers, the Sadducees, and only after some generations did they get used to calling themselves also by this title...\" (pg. 33-34, footnote 119)</p>\n<p>So in other words, the old meaning of the word \"prushim\" was a reference to heretics, people who made themselves external, meaning, people who left the orthodoxy, the mainstream. In the Sadducees' view, the Chachamim (sages) had left the orthodoxy. Finkelstein notes (pg. 25) that the Sadducees thought that Torah authority rested only in the hands of the Kohen Gadol and his men, no one else, which stands in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.1-12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the sages' tradition</a> of Moshe receiving the Torah at Sinai and passing it down through the generations to many non-Kohen Gedolim people - Yehoshua (from the tribe of Efraim), etc. The one person who stands out in this list is Shimon Kohen Gadol, who was both a KG and a leader among the Pharisees/sages. For what the Sadducees perceived to be the Pharisees deviating from the proper halachic and hashkafic views, they felt they deserved to be deemed heretics.</p>\n<p>During this era, the teachings that used the negative meaning of \"prushim\" began to pop up, because that's what the word meant at the time - to all sects. In Sotah, in the Tosefta in Brachot and in other places, such as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.5.2?vhe=Talmud_Bavli,_Vilna_1883_ed.&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Avot D'Rabbi Natan section</a> that recounts how the Sadducees and Baytusees came to be. The term there is also \"pirshu\" - \"[they] left\", clearly because they left the mainstream of the sages and set up new sects.</p>\n<p>Later on, though, the name stuck somehow to the Pharisees, and they adopted it themselves. It was at this time that they created positive meanings for the term, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sotah.9.15?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 9:15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Vayikra_Rabbah.24.4-6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabbah 24:4</a>, and so forth.</p>\n<p>The older definition was still in occasional use, though, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.11?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchot Teshuvah 3:11</a>, but in general, the term evolved to become a positive one.</p>\n<p>Note: Based on this, definition, it seems that the reason that the authors of the NT constantly used the term \"Pharisees\" to refer to the sages was because they considered them heretics. If any of the times that the NT's Jesus says the word \"Pharisees\" in reference to the sages (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woes_of_the_Pharisees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for example</a>) is an actual quote, then that means that Jesus was not of them (a contradiction to the modern claims among some that Jesus was a Pharisee), for if he was part of them, he would not insult them so (I believe that even in the most harsh of debates, the Pharisees didn't call one another so).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I edited Sefaria's translation per Finkelstein's understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

This brings up a potential <em>mar'is ha'ayin</em> issue, though, if people would cook or eat their remaining quail together with the tofu manna. </p>\n\n<p>The Rama holds that there is no problem to combine milk substitutes with poultry (ibid.). He interprets the verse as allowing baking or boiling poultry and tofu together with no need for a distinctive indication that the tofu is pareve. <em>Shach</em> (87:6) disagrees and says that the prohibition applies to poultry as well, but only on a rabbinic level.

His newborn son, it seems, is either a great sage or a king (or possibly his wife gave birth to 600,000-tuplets), which is a circumstance that calls for saying a blessing. So your friend must have been intending to say a blessing, and fully expected that like Rabba bar bar Chana, he would find a golden pigeon.

A certain elder found him and said to him: “And put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite”, (as a warning to distance himself from them and not to drink their wine, because they were not reliable). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar went and related those matters before Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Meir issued a decree against them. What is the reason that the Samaritans are deemed unreliable? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: <strong>They found that they possessed a likeness of a pigeon</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the elderly man in the Gemara warns us that every Samaritan owns the likeness of a pigeon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Chullin.6a.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot ad loc.</a> explain that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכל מקום שהוא מזכיר ההוא סבא הוא אליהו</p>\n  \n  <p>Whenever the Gemara mentions 'a certain elder', he is Eliyahu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How did Eliyahu know that the Samaritans have these pigeons?</p>\n\n<p>Well, we know that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105660/why-does-eliyahu-appear-at-a-brit-milah\">Eliyahu appears at every <em>berit milah</em></a>.

I would be wary of giving it to him though, bearing in mind <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the second commandment</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

And Mi Yodeya was at that time a province of the kingdom. There came to be promoted one hundred and twenty-seven governors of Personnel and Media higher than any of their fellow officials in the palace.</p>\n\n<p>There was a Jewish woman in Shushan, the capital, by the name of Mordeca. And she was foster to many of the provinces of the kingdom, including Shushan, the capital. And she was highly regarded by the Jews and popular with the multitude of her colleagues, bearers of the royal signet. And she found favor in the eyes of the ministers of the court.</p>\n\n<p>Now the one hundred and twenty-seven governors said to themselves, \"there is a certain individual who is spread out among many of the provinces of the realm, whose language is different from the language of the palace, and who does not follow the laws of the kingdom, and it is not in our interest to tolerate her.\" And they were filled with rage, <em>so they hurried messengers posthaste to remove the royal signet from Mordeca's hand, and they impaled her upon the book of records</em>. And the governors sat down each week to celebrate, but the city of Shushan was confused.</p>\n\n<p>In every province that the governors' command and decree reached, there was great mourning, wailing and weeping. And many of the people of the capital cast off their signets, for the fear of the governors had befallen them.</p>\n\n<p><em>Some time afterward,</em> a royal edict was issued, including in the laws of the kingdom that \"the people in all the provinces of the kingdom shall speak the language of the palace, omitting nothing of what we have decreed.\"</p>\n\n<p>And many of the residents of Shushan came before the court, and said, \"if we have won your favor and the proposal seems right to you, let dispatches be written countermanding those which were written, and let the royal signet be returned to the hand of Mordeca.\" And they spoke to them day after day, and they would not listen to them. Then the governors dispatched their ministers to say, \"if Mordeca will kneel and bow low before the palace, then there will be a poor ... that is, a chance, that she can be returned to her place in the palace gate.\" <em>But they said to their ministers inside the inner court</em>, \"Now that this decree has been written in the name of the palace, it may not be revoked. The royal signet will not be placed upon her hand.\" And Mordeca would not kneel and would not bow low.</p>\n\n<p>Some time afterward, when the anger of Shushan had subsided, the one hundred and twenty-seven governors thought about what they had done and what they had decreed against Mordeca. And they asked themselves \"What should be done to a person whom we desire to honor? And whom should we desire to honor more than ministers who are beloved of Shushan and who intercede for the welfare of the people of the realm?\" <em>But the opposite happened, and they impaled Shaashgaz and Carshena upon stakes</em>, for they were ministers who were beloved of Shushan and who had interceded for the welfare of the people of the realm. And Harbona, another of the guardians of the signet-bearers, who is also remembered as good, <em>went out from the palace</em>. And the city of Shushan was again confused.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Talmud (Berachot 7a) tells us that Mi Yodeya was calculating the moment of God's anger:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא מלמד שהיה יודע לכוין אותה שעה שהקב\"ה כועס בה</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather this teaches that Yodeya was calculating that moment which God gets angry during.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But what would be the point of figuring out this moment? It can't be to use it against someone else, because the Talmud just a few lines later says that such a practice is improper:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ההוא מינא דהוה בשבבותיה דר' יהושע בן לוי הוה קא מצער ליה טובא בקראי יומא חד שקל תרנגולא ואוקמיה בין כרעי' דערסא ועיין ביה סבר כי מטא ההיא שעתא אלטייה כי מטא ההיא שעתא ניים אמר ש\"מ לאו אורח ארעא למעבד הכי </p>\n  \n  <p>The sectarian in the neighborhood of R. Joshua the son of Levi was tormenting him greatly with verses. One day [R. Joshua the son of Levi] took a rooster and placed it between the legs of the bed and gazed at it. He thought \"when that moment comes I will curse him\". When that moment came he had dozed off. He said \"we see from here that it is not proper to do this\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rather it must be that the purpose of calculating the moment of God's anger is to be able to emulate it. This falls under the positive commandment of והלכת בדרכיו, as enumerated in the eighth positive commandment according to Rambam:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>להידמות בדרכיו הטובים והישרים שנאמר והלכת בדרכיו</p>\n  \n  <p>To be similar to His good and just ways, as it says: \"and you shall go in His ways\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> (1:54) we see the opposite – God's anger is not real anger, it is only an imitation of human anger:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>His actions towards mankind also include great calamities, which overtake individuals and bring death to them, or affect whole families and even entire regions, spread death, destroy generation after generation, and spare nothing whatsoever. Hence there occur inundations, earthquakes, destructive storms, expeditions of one nation against the other for the sake of destroying it with the sword and blotting out its memory, and many other evils of the same kind. <strong>Whenever such evils are caused by us to any person, they originate in great anger, violent jealousy, or a desire for revenge. God is therefore called, because of these acts, \"jealous,\" \"revengeful,\" \"wrathful,\" and \"keeping anger\" (Nah. i. 2) that is to say, He performs acts similar to those which, when performed by us, originate in certain psychical dispositions, in jealousy, desire for retaliation, revenge, or anger</strong>: they are in accordance with the guilt of those who are to be punished, and not the result of any emotion: for He is above all defect!</p>\n  \n  <p>(Friedlander translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The resolution to this circular activity lies in the principle of לא דברה תורה אלא כנגד יצר הרע – \"The torah spoke only against the Evil Inclination\" (Kiddushin 21b). There are certain things that are simply too difficult for man to abide by. If they would be completely forbidden man would end up violating them. In these situations the Torah devises a way in which the thing can become permissible while still retaining the general prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>In our case this works as follows: God would normally never get angry – indeed in the Talmudic passage in Berachot cited above, the Talmud was quite surprised that God could get angry:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומי איכא רתחא קמיה דקודשא בריך הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>Is there, in fact, anger by The Holy One Blessed Be He?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Man, left to his own devices, would naturally get angry, and it would be useless to completely forbid this. Instead, God takes on the human characteristic of anger and then commands man to imitate Him. </p>\n\n<p>Now this would seem to not really solve the problem if man still ends up getting angry. But there's a catch. As explained in the chapter on anger in Orchot Tzadikim, there is a fundamental difference in God's anger abilities compared to man's anger abilities:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובהשם יתברך נאמר ברוגז רחם תזכור וזה רחוק מאוד מדרכי בשר ודם</p>\n  \n  <p>About God it says \"in anger remember your mercy\", but this is exceedingly far from the ways of man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, God can be both angry and merciful simultaneously while man cannot. Thus, when imitating God it is impossible for man to imitate Him fully and incorporate both the anger and the mercy. Man has to thus choose between these two <em>middot</em>, and we know that when anger and mercy conflict mercy should win out, as this is the prayer that God prays and the blessing that God received in Berachot 7a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שיכבשו רחמיך את כעסך</p>\n  \n  <p>that your mercy should conquer your anger</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In conclusion, then, the anger of Mi Yodeya that you inquired about is not real anger. It is in fact mercy in the guise of anger as part of an elaborate trick of the Evil Inclination. As such you should have nothing to worry about.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I really think its only referring to the Mods.

    "content": "# May one tell a Gentile to drive his car immediately before Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During a recent Shulchan Aruch lesson, I learned that one may not tell a Gentile tailor immediately before Shabbat to fix a suit that he will need immediately after Shabbat, as this is clear that he will be doing the work on Shabbat for him. This falls under the prohibition <em>Amirah Lenachri</em> (\"telling a Gentile\".)</p>\n\n<p>Extending this - let's say one is driving home with a Gentile friend in one's car. He and his friend live in the same neighborhood. He sees that it is approaching sundown on Friday. He pulls over and asks the Gentile to drive his car. Is this considered <em>amirah lenachri</em>, as we know that the Gentile will be driving his car on Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>Or, can we reason that they are just sharing the driving and let's say the Jew says plainly, \"it's your turn to drive, now\", without specifying anything relating to Shabbat, that this would make it permissible to ride in the car and it is not <em>amirah lenachri</em>? Perhaps, we can also reason that his friend also wants to get to his home, as well. Thus, driving the car is not specifically to benefit the Jew.</p>\n\n<p>Please focus the answer to just the <em>amirah lenachri</em> issue. There may be other peripheral problems of doing this, such as <em>mar'it ayin</em> when the Jew arrives home.</p>\n\n\n",

The names you're used to hearing, such as Robby Yishma'el, Robby Yehudah, and Robby Yosi are all misnomers caused by corruptions in Ashkenazic voweling of Talmudic texts. There is no רָבִי (Robby) in the Talmudic text, the honorific should be pronounced as רִבִי (Ribbi) which is how it's written in Sephardic and Yemenite manuscripts.</p>\n\n<p>So then the real question is who were Ribbi Yishma'el, Ribbi Yehudah, and Ribbi Yosi named after? In truth they are all paying homage to the great wisdom imparted onto our sages by frogs, who often chant Ribbi/Ribbit as they contemplate the mysteries of the holy Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Here are just two such stories of the holyness of frogs, for which we owe so much Torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God says to the prophets, 'Think not that if you do not carry my messages, my will cannot be made known in the world. I have many messengers-even such as a scorpion, a snake, a frog, or an insect.'--Mid. Eccles. 5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tmm/tmm14.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tmm/tmm14.htm</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Hanina learned from his deathbed-ridden father that he would\n  lose both his parents on the same day. Further, his father instructed\n  him to go to the market immediately after the mourning period ended\n  (which would be Passover eve) and purchase the first item that he saw.\n  When Hanina went to the market after completing the days of mourning\n  for his parents, he was offered a grossly overpriced silver dish. In\n  the interest of honoring his father, he bought the dish, and upon\n  opening it at the Seder, he found another dish inside holding a frog.</p>\n  \n  <p>Like a good pet owner Hanina fed the frog, which grew to an enormous\n  size. First he had to build a cabinet to house it, and when it got\n  even larger, an entire room. The frog literally ate Hanina out of\n  house and home, but it recognized the imposition it was presenting and\n  offered Hanina whatever he wished. Hanina asked to be taught the\n  entire Torah, and the frog agreed. It wrote the Torah on paper, which\n  Hanina consumed.</p>\n  \n  <p>In so doing, he not only learned the whole Torah, but also all 70\n  languages as well as the languages of animals (much like King Solomon\n  did). And just as Solomon, in asking only for knowledge, he also\n  acquired wealth and power. The frog gave Hanina and his wife precious\n  stones and herbs (which carried medicinal powers) and revealed his\n  true identity as one of Adam’s sons, born during his 130-year\n  separation from Eve, who was capable of shape shifting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sources: <a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/sections/the-frog-the-demons-and-the-jewish-star/2008/10/01/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishpress.com/sections/the-frog-the-demons-and-the-jewish-star/2008/10/01/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=jM6bDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT73&lpg=PT73&dq=The+Frog+who+taught+Rabbi+Hanina+the+whole+Torah&source=bl&ots=pnqcTbRann&sig=ACfU3U1XPU6FmEjv4VFqO3394enyn4CX6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDlImptOvnAhVQRa0KHb0rBvIQ6AEwBHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Frog%20who%20taught%20Rabbi%20Hanina%20the%20whole%20Torah&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://books.google.com/books?id=jM6bDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT73&lpg=PT73&dq=The+Frog+who+taught+Rabbi+Hanina+the+whole+Torah&source=bl&ots=pnqcTbRann&sig=ACfU3U1XPU6FmEjv4VFqO3394enyn4CX6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDlImptOvnAhVQRa0KHb0rBvIQ6AEwBHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Frog%20who%20taught%20Rabbi%20Hanina%20the%20whole%20Torah&f=false</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Frequently in the Talmud, we see some rabbi who says something and the Talmud points out that another rabbi had said the same thing at a much earlier time and, usually, in a different tractate.

But, the political powers of the time were concerned that future readers would assume that just about everyone in the Talmud was a robber, including the numerous honest people. So, they hid that fact and just called them \"robbie\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While your question asks about people, I should point out that there are three notable \"Bobbies\" in the Talmud that have their own tractates named after them:</p>\n\n<p>Bobby Kamma, Bobby Metzia (he was lost for many years, but he found himself, finally), and Bobby Batra.</p>\n\n\n",

Nisan signals the Exodus and our establishing as a people. Sivan has the giving of the Torah. Kislev has the story of Channukah and its joy. Why is Adar singled out as a joyous month when we have other occasions of joy in our calendar (some of which are Torah based, not from the post Mosaic period)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When the Talmud (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta'anit 29a</a>) states that we increase joy when Adar comes in Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ימי נסים היו לישראל פורים ופסח</p>\n<p>They were days of miracles for Israel – Purim and Passover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can perhaps derive two things from here. First of all, the increased joy may not be limited to Adar; it may extend into Nissan as that is when Passover occurs, or at the very least if it is limited to Adar the joy still covers non-Adar events. Second of all, we are apparently given the reason for the increased joy. It seems we are extra joyous because of the miracles that were done for Israel, particularly miracles involving saving Israel from destruction. Indeed, the holidays of Purim and Passover are unique in that regard, as the miracles they represent are about Israel being saved from destruction, something which the rest of the calendar lacks.</p>\n<p>There is also a responsum from R. Jacob Emden (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1408&pgnum=226\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">She'eilat Ya'avetz 2:88</a>) that seems to address this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלת עוד מה הזקיק רש\"י שם בגמ' משנכנס אדר לפרש ימי נסים היו פורים ופסח פשוט שהוצרך לכך משום דאי משום פורים גרידא א\"כ לימא נמי ניסן וכסלו אלא ע\"כ משום שהתחילו ימי נסים רצופים ותכופים זה לזה</p>\n<p>You asked further, what bound Rashi there in the Gemara of \"when Adar enters\" to explain [it as] they were days of miracles – Purim and Passover? It is obvious that he had to [do] this because if [it was] because of Purim alone, then it should have also said Nissan and Kislev. Rather, it must be because the days of miracles began continuous and immediate to each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like from the fact that the Talmud only mentions Adar, we can derive that it must be the unique facet that it is the beginning of a set of miracles, not just a particular miracle as would be elsewhere in the calendar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Drukman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Drukman</a> often brings the following parable:</p>\n\n<p>If you meet a friend in a place where you expect to meet him, like at work or at shul, then it's nice to meet him, and you're happy about it, but it's not something so special. Now, if you go, say, on a hiking trip in some wadi or such, and then suddenly meet your friend, you're even more happy to see him, because you have added happiness from the unexpected situation. Finally, if you and your friend have drifted apart for some years, and you don't think you'll ever be in touch anymore, and then you get tangled up in a difficult or dangerous situation, and suddenly out of nowhere your friend, who you thought wasn't your friend anymore, appears to save you - your happiness will increase tenfold or hundredfold over any previous situation.</p>\n\n<p>During other holidays, while our happiness is great at the wondrous miracles Hashem did for us - it was expected, more or less. Or at least, it didn't come as such a big surprise.</p>\n\n<p>But on Purim we were in a position of \"Hester Panim\", Hashem hid His face from us. We were in exile, there was no Shechinah there, and we were in danger of being wiped off the face of the planet. In general, we thought Hashem had abandoned us. And then, out of nowhere, Hashem revealed His face and everything changed - \"ונהפוך הוא\", and we realized that Hashem is still with us. That's why on Purim and all of Adar our happiness is greater than other holidays. </p>\n\n\n",

According to the interesting article you brought, the 19 year cycle of mirroring the two calendars is a misconception. What really happens in a 19 year cycle of the Jewish calendar is that there are a couple of rules that need to be kept constantly in order to properly maintain the solar & lunar calendar we use:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rosh Hashanah can't come out on Sunday, Wednesday or Friday (and subsequently, Pesach can't come out on Monday, Wednesday or Friday). To ensure this, changes are made to the months of Marcheshvan and/or Kislev of the previous year, depending on the circumstances.</p></li>\n<li><p>Leap years (Shanah Me'uberet) are made every 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th year during the cycle.

The proper translation should be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever observes <em>shabbat</em> like <strong>Dot</strong>, desecrates it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dot is the name of a popular cartoon character from the days of Chazal. See:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Dot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Dot</a></p>\n\n<p>Evidently, the author of this song did not think Dot was Shomer Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I think you may have incorrectly parsed the sentence, because you did not look at the preceding clause. It should be read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מקדש שביעי כראוי</p>\n<p>Whoever sanctifies the Sabbath properly</p>\n<p>לו כל שומר שבת כדת מחללו</p>\n<p><strong>To him</strong>, anyone who keeps the Sabbath according to the law desecrates it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read this way the supposed paradox falls away. It's not making an objective claim that someone who keeps the Sabbath in fact desecrates it. The claim is, rather, that from the perspective of one who sanctifies the Sabbath properly, one who <em>merely</em> observes the law is as if he desecrated the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>Now what are these two categories? These are explained in other Talmudic passages. In <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=12&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Megillah 12a</a> we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי כדת אמר רבי חנן משם רבי מאיר כדת של תורה</p>\n<p>What is \"according to the law\"? R. Chanan in the name of R. Meir said \"according to the law of the Torah\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=3&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ketubot 3a</a> we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל דמקדש אדעתא דרבנן מקדש</p>\n<p>Whoever sanctifies according to the Rabbis, sanctifies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we see from these two passages that שומר שבת כדת means that he fulfills the Torah laws of the Sabbath, while  מקדש שביעי כראוי means that he also fulfills the rabbinic laws of the Sabbath. From the perspective of fulfilling rabbinic laws, one who only fulfills the Torah laws is indeed desecrating the Sabbath.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The last word in the phrase, מחללו - desecrates <strong>it</strong> is a reference to the word דת, not the word שבת. So the meaning of the full phrase is:</p>\n\n<p><em>Whomever observes Shabbat like a religious person, desecrates <strong>him</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Today's religious Jewish world is highly competitive, as you know. Every person is trying to \"outfrum\" his neighbor. My kashrut is better than yours. My shul or yeshiva is more religious than yours. It's all a false attempt at doing and saying things that make them appear better and more religious than you and fluff their ego while mitigating your own fine observance. </p>\n\n<p>Same idea happens with Shabbat. If you observe Shabbat like a (more) religious person, by being more religious than your neighbor, you are desecrating your neighbor's ego and personality. \nThis is a serious sin as it hurts your neighbor's feelings, and is, possibly a form of revenge. It may also be a form of \"stumbling block before the blind\", as you make others view you as more religious than you actually are. It's also being self-dishonest.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm in confusion about (a) do these passages describe the same ohel mo'ed? And if so (or even if not so) why is the menorah described differently: </p>\n\n<p>Shemot 30:27</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֶת־הַשֻּׁלְחָן֙ וְאֶת־כָּל־כֵּלָ֔יו <strong>וְאֶת־הַמְּנֹרָ֖ה</strong> וְאֶת־כֵּלֶ֑יהָ\n  וְאֵ֖ת מִזְבַּ֥ח הַקְּטֹֽרֶת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shemot 31:8</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאֶת־הַשֻּׁלְחָן֙ וְאֶת־כֵּלָ֔יו <strong>וְאֶת־הַמְּנֹרָ֥ה הַטְּהֹרָ֖ה</strong>\n  וְאֶת־כָּל־כֵּלֶ֑יהָ וְאֵ֖ת מִזְבַּ֥ח הַקְּטֹֽרֶת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Shemot 30:27 the menorah is simply referred to as '<em>menorah</em>', whereas in Shemot 31:8 it is referred to as the '<em>menorah-ha'tehorah</em>'.</p>\n\n<p>If the annointing had made it tehorah, why not all the other annointed kelim? If it is a new ohel, what is different about the 'new' menorah? I can't seem to find commentary that discusses why only the menorah has the 'tehorah' added as a suffix.  It probably means I'm missing something extremely obvious, but I haven't figured it out yet.  Rashi explains that 'ha'tehorah' refers to 'pure', to say, it was made of pure gold. Wasn't the first menorah of pure gold?</p>\n\n\n",

But I recognize the [tequmah] stone. It is a hollow stone that rattles when moved. Four such [stones] of differing sizes were owned by Muslim families in the [capital] city of Sana'a.

The candidate/party can be identified either by name or by a defining characteristic.</p>\n<p>** It shouldn't just be any \"mention\" of the candidate's name, but rather specifically something related to voting or a position of power, etc.</p>\n<p>Obviously this is not the final stand on who to vote for, as always, consult your rabbi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

They even had large festivities called a Siyum HaShas, a party to celebrate that Shas is finished.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, many said they would return to Shas. \"Hadran alecha Shas...\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Not quite what you are looking for, but it does say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תעל שועתם אל האלהים מן העבדה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which obviously means that T\"aal's (the Arab party) salvation will come from votes to the Labor party.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_of_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirate Party</a> is going to make it big, which is why one should vote for them, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 6:26</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֣י פִתְאֹ֔ם יָבֹ֥א הַשֹּׁדֵ֖ד עָלֵֽינוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: Suddenly, the Pirate was upon us.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zechariah.11.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariah 11:3</a> also prophesied of the future crowning of the Pirate [Party] and the wisdom he/they have: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ק֚וֹל שַׁאֲגַ֣ת כְּפִירִ֔ים כִּ֥י שוֹדד גְּא֥וֹן הַיַּרְדֵּֽן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: The sound of the roar of the lions<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6INp3k-vFc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [which symbolizes monarchy]</a>, for the pirate is the genius of the Jordan [river].</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# PTIJ: Electoral College in the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In these turbulent times where our American brethren fight among themselves on whether or not to keep using the Electoral College, I have a question:</p>\n<p>It says in the Tur (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.1.1?vhe=Choshen_Mishpat,_Vilna,_1923&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 1:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...lies have no legs [to stand on] but truth is the foundation and it is a big pillar for all things. And similarly, peace, as they say in Avot (Pirkei Avot 3:2), “One should pray for the peace of the government, for were it not for the fear of government, people would swallow each other alive.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see here a clear connection between truth and peace and government. Perhaps the reason that Americans are fighting is because they don't see truth in the Electoral College and are unwilling to continue living a lie.</p>\n<p>So, is the Electoral College truth or not?</p>\n<p>Or in other words,</p>\n<p>?אלקטורל קולג' מן התורה מנין</p>\n<p>Where do we find the Electoral College in the Torah (with the Torah being truth of course, as is said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.119.142?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 119:142</a>) \"צִדְקָתְךָ֣ צֶ֣דֶק לְעוֹלָ֑ם וְֽתוֹרָתְךָ֥ אֱמֶֽת׃\" - \"Your righteousness is eternal, your Torah is true)?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

But each state is addressed by the term בני, so it has multiple representatives. Those are the electoral college.</p>\n<p>The pasuk talks about their downfall, so maybe we'll overturn this silliness.</p>\n<h1>Edit:</h1>\n<p>Davar Acher (a better explain in medrashim jargon)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבְנֵ֖י אֶ֣רֶץ הַבְּרִ֑ית אִתָּ֖ם בַּחֶ֥רֶב יִפֹּֽלוּ</p>\n<p>\"And the representatives of the State with them will poll by the knife\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"By the knife\" means as a block, that all of the representatives of the State will vote as a single block.</p>\n<p>According to this the EC is here to stay. :(</p>\n\n\n",

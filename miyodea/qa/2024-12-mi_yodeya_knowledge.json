The verse begins with an aleph and ends with an aleph, which teaches that they were all of one heart to their Father in Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What exactly does this mean? Are there explanations on what this Baal HaTurim means and how this is important when fighting Hashem's wars?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The verse is talking about new generation who did not stand at mt. Sinai. One could think that Baal haTurim hints that the new generation achieved unity for the war comparable to the one their fathers had when receiving the Torah, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.19.2.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Exodus 19:2</a> quotes Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 19:2:10, כאיש אחד בלב אחד - as one man with one heart. However, the Rashi's comment states, that only at Sinai the encampment of Bnei Yisrael had such kind of unity. In other words the Jewish people were united in their desire to serve Hashem, be a holly nation, which brought their hearts and minds in unison. A similar expression is used when describing the approaching of the pharaoh's army towards <em>bnei Yisrael</em>, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.14.10.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Exodus 14:10</a> quoting Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 14:10:3: בלב אחד כאיש אחד - with one heart like one man - in reverse order vs. Exodus 19:2. In other words the unity of a heart was built by the thought of revenge against the enemy. Egyptians were seeking revenge against Israelies, and Israelies were seeking revenge against Midianites and in both cases the idea united the people.</p>\n<p>The reason why unity when waging war is important is discussed in mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sotah.8.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sota 8:5</a> among other places. Any breach of the front line due to any lack of unity can lead to exceedingly large losses. In fact all mishnayot in perek 8 of Sota add good points on the issue of unity.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What commandments did Reuben and Gad break?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Sources criticize the tribes of Reuben and Gad for two things: Not settling in the Land of Israel and placing their cattle above their children. [Midrash Tanhuma, Matot, Siman 7; Numbers Rabbah 22:9; Proverbs 20:21]  They were punished by being the first of the Ten Tribes to be exiled.</p>\n<p>1-They did not settle in the Land of Israel because the land east of the Jordan was better for their cattle.  They got <em>permission from Moses</em>, in exchange for fighting with the other tribes in the frontline, which they did for seven years.  Whether or not a Jew is commanded to live in the Land of Israel is still a matter of dispute.  Naḥmanides says yes and Maimonides says no, according to the lists of 613 they left us.  Both sages acted on their beliefs.  When Maimonides was forced out of Muslim Spain, he lived only very briefly in Israel, then moved to Egypt, did all his work there and died there.  When Naḥmanides was forced out of Catalonia, he went directly to Israel, and worked and died there.</p>\n<p>2-They said: \"We will build here enclosures for our flocks and towns for our children.\" [Numbers 32:16], and Moses gently rebuked them by reversing the order: \"Build towns for your children and enclosures for your flocks\". [Numbers 32:20,24]  But there is no commandment to build dwellings for your children before you build enclosures for your cattle.  And they never said they were going to <em>start</em> with the cattle pens, they only <em>mentioned</em> them first to emphasize that they were settling there because of their cattle.</p>\n<p>So what commandments did Reuben and Gad break?</p>\n<p>One could argue that the Torah says: \"Be sure to keep the commandments… Do what is right and good in the sight of God.\" [Deut. 6:17-18]  The Talmud says the repetition means that you must sometimes go beyond what is strictly commanded. Perhaps Reuben and Gad did not do that.  But it's a very subjective matter.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The way the question is stated - is somewhat misleading. <em>Bnei Reuven</em> and <em>bnei Gad</em> were not exiled after they chose to live east of Jordan. However, their choice to be separate from other tribes created a number of problems, which resulted in sins, caused the decline of their society, and perhaps resulted in early exile many years later since they were also the first frontier of defense against Ammon, Moav, Edom, and Aram.</p>\n<p>There is a comment of Tur, haAroch on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur_HaArokh%2C_Genesis.30.11.1?vhe=Perush_al_ha-Torah,_Hanover,_1838&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 30:11</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותאמר לאה בגד. י\"מ על שם שבני גד היו ראשונים שבגדו לקחת נחלה בארץ ישראל כדכתיב ויגשו בני גד ובני ראובן.\nBlockquote\nThe meaning of the root בגד - betray. There are comments that bnei Reuven and bnei Gad were first to betray (joint tribal acquisition of Eretz Israel)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yehoshua 22</a> describes a bigger problem, which resulted from settlement of Bnei Gad and Bnei Reuven east of Jordan. They realized that their descendants may not want to go to Shilo for festivals and have connection with other tribes. They started building an altar as a reminder of tribal connection west of Jordan. The building almost sparked the tribal war averted by Pinchas.</p>\n<p>Finally, the mussar seforim state that absence of fathers east of Jordan river during the time of conquest negatively affected the children, so that they grew up being more cruel to others. The accidental killings east of Jordan were more frequent than in Eretz Israel, which had a higher population density. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.35.14?lang=bi&with=Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bamidbar 35:14.</a></p>\n<p>In other words, one may make a <em>halakhically</em> acceptable decision which may, neverthelss, yield bad and difficult consequences.

Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%96%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Refael Binyamin Posen</a> in his book Parshegen (פרשגן) on Onkelos (Bamidbar, pp. 665-667 and nn.), the best manuscripts of Onkelos don't have the Aramaic of verse 3. It seems that this Aramaic list of names originated in one manuscript tradition of Targum Yerushalmi, and at one point some scribes mixed in this translation into some manuscript copies of Onkelos, and from there it made its way to the Onkelos of the editio princeps (first printed edition) of Mikraot Gedolot. In other words, Onkelos was consistent, but later scribes botched up some branches of the textual tradition and unfortunately these were used for Mikraot Gedolot, which is how this version of Onkelos was popularized and why this translation is thought to be original. It should also be noted that there are several variants to this list in other manuscripts of Targum Yerushalmi, including some significant changes.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Per Rabbi Posen, I'll also correct my comment on the question: It's not entirely certain that these Aramaic names are Roman-era identifications of these Tanachic sites, because some of the names are literal translations of the Hebrew. For example, another version of the Targum Yerushalmi translates יעזר as סיען (Si'an); in Hebrew the word סיוע means עזרה (Ezra: help, assist). Nevo actually appears as-is in later sources, so the name בית קבורתא דמושה (the burial of Moshe) simply comes to explain the significance of the site and was likely not the actual name of the Roman period town at the site. Rabbi Yehoshua Falk (or Valk) in his commentary Beit Yisrael (AKA Perisha and Derisha) on the Tur, Hilchot Shabbat, § 285 also <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36271&pgnum=130\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explained</a> the name מכללתא as a literal translation of עטרות, because עטרה (Atarah) means crown, and מכללתא in his opinion comes from כליל (Kelil), which also means crown. On the other hand, בית נימרה/נימרין is known from contemporary sources (including being <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.9.2.5?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Shevi'it 9:2</a>'s proposed identification of Nimrah). And כומרין in particular caught my eye because of its phonetic similarity to Qumran, and it has been <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24607072\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">suggested</a> in the past that Qumran is derived from כומריא (Kumria, which means \"priests\" in Syriac (also related to כומר [komer] in Hebrew). While the general area of Ya'azer is far from Qumran, in light of the phonetic and possible etymological similarity, it's possible that there is a preservation of a real site name here.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> For a full list of variants, see Alexander Sperber, Kitvei Ha'kodesh Be'aramit (כתבי הקדש בארמית), vol. 1, p. 279, verse 32.

However, Yoel Elitzur, <em>Shemot Mekomot Kedumim Be'Eretz Yisrael</em> (שמות מקומות קדומים בארץ ישראל), p. 310, n. 3 (cont.) noted that he found the theory to be original but ultimately unconvincing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ramban to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.32.38?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 32:38</a> explains that the cities changed their names twice after they got the names from the Moabites who settled them before (1).  After the Amorites' conquest, the new rulers named them after their idols. When bnei Reuven and Bnei Gad aquired the cities from Amorites they returned the original Moabite names (because they wanted to shame the Amorites and because they did not want to call the names of their idols). Chizkuni (citing Bechor Shor), Rashi and R. Saadia Gaon offer other reasons, but the Ramban's seems to be the most compelling.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) The Torah states that Moabites took over the territory of giant Refaim (Eimim) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.10-11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 2:10-11</a>.

    "content": "# If מי יימר דדמך סומק טפי is true, and the same logic applies to property, then what about a property case where דמך סומק טפי?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud in Sanhedrin 74a states that if a Jew is forced to either forfeit his or her life or murder another, he or she must give up his or her life. The Talmud continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רוצח גופיה מנא לן סברא הוא דההוא דאתא לקמיה דרבה ואמר ליה אמר לי מרי\nדוראי זיל קטליה לפלניא ואי לא קטלינא לך אמר ליה לקטלוך ולא תיקטול מי\nיימר דדמא דידך סומק טפי דילמא דמא דהוא גברא סומק טפי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks: From where do we derive this halakha with regard to a murderer himself, that one must allow himself to be killed rather than commit murder? The Gemara answers: It is based on logical reasoning that one life is not preferable to another, and therefore there is no need for a verse to teach this halakha. The Gemara relates an incident to demonstrate this:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As when a certain person came before Rabba and said to him: The lord of my place, a local official, said to me: Go kill so-and-so, and if not I will kill you, what shall I do? Rabba said to him: It is preferable that he should kill you and you should not kill. Who is to say that your blood is redder than his, that your life is worth more than the one he wants you to kill? Perhaps that man’s blood is redder. This logical reasoning is the basis for the halakha that one may not save his own life by killing another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>By the same logic if one is forced to destroy his friend's property or forfeit his own property of equal value, he should forfeit his own - who says your property is more valuable than your friends? And if one is forced to either beat his friend or receive a similar beating, he should opt to receive the beating.\nDo we find these parallel rules in Halacha?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Let's add a twist. Someone threatens you - destroy your friend's bottle of soda or I will destroy your house. What now?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The way I understood it, is really by all mitzvos you dont give up your life, since vichai bahem ( you should live by them). The gemara said that logic to explain why this din doesn't apply to murder.\nWhen it comes to any aveira a person is obligated to give up all his money not to do so. So if someone tells you to destroy someones property you would have to give up all your stuff not to do so. That logic cant permit you to do an aveira.\nThere might be other reasons why you would be allowed to distroy your friends stuff, maybe he would allow it to save your house etc..\nBut just because your property is more valuable wouldn't allow you to destroy your friends stuff. We dont see from the gemara that using that logic would allow a person to do an aveira.</p>\n\n\n",

Ask him to show you the way to rid yourselves of\npride.[2] If he will suggest to you a way to do so, know that he is\nnot the right man; but if he will exclaim \"may G-d help” then\nattach yourselves to him ..[3]</p>\n<p>Do the continuation of the of Chabad Rebbes teach this lesson also that the only way to get rid of pride is to keep praying to Hashem or was there a new inovation some how that was created after made to completly get rid of it as you always hear about consepts like getting rid of all the chometz which stands for the yeshus and getting rid of all the yeshus ect.</p>\n<p>Souces\n[1] <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/15757\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/15757</a> Pg 88</p>\n<p>[2] [Part of the comentary from the book] Based on numerous dicta in Talmud, Midrashim and Zohar,\nChassidism teaches that pride, self-enhancement, is tantamount to extreme impurity and is the root of misguided passions and evil; see\nKether Shem Tov , sect. 376 (and my notes ad loc)  Sefer Baal Shem\nTov , vol. II, p.101ff. Thus pride above all is the sin man must guard himself against, up to his very last moment. The Baal Shem Tov is said to have prayed on his death-bed, in the very last moments of his life: \"Do not bring me into the path of pride” ( Psalms XXXVI: 12); see Sefer Baal Shem Tov, vol. II, p. 106 note 13, and p.246f.</p>\n<p>[3] [continuation from the comments]  Sefer Baal Shem Tov , vol. II, p. 106 note 13.</p>\n\n\n",

Should one strike them first before they strike you? Is one obligated to hate them? Are they allowed for <em>aliya</em>? Valid witnesses? Can one inform others and believe if warned i.e. Laws of Lashon Hara regarding such an individual etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Basically, I am not trying to ask too many questions, I just want a full understanding of what the Torah says about such a person and how we should deal with such a person.</strong></s></p>\n<p>[I have separated out the latter half of this question into <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/144262/status-of-rasha-in-the-modern-day\">its own question]</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Perhaps, one could look in the book <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0765760517\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Right and the Good\" by R. Daniel Z. Feldman</a>, Section 11 titled \"One Strike and You Are Out: Hitting and Raising a Hand in Violence\", p 159-168. Since you are asking only about threats, I am providing the relevant middle subsection.</p>\n<p>The basic implication of the gemara about this is that a person who threatens another with violence is a Rasha, as we learn from Moshe Rabbeinu and Dasan and Aviram (see OP for source).</p>\n<p>Some hold that this is not to be taken literally in halacha, but is rather meant to provide a stigma against people who do this, as a deterrent to actual violence (e.g. R Aharon Grossman, VDarashta VChakarta pp 120-122).</p>\n<p>There is discussion about the reasons for the prohibition. R Chaim Kanevsky (cited in L'Reacha Kamocha vol 3 #43) holds that the prohibition is actually intending harm, and R David Ariav (ibid) questions if maybe it is due to the fear instilled by the threat i.e. <em>ona'at devarim</em>. The nafka mina is if the person threatened didn't know about it, then there's no sin.</p>\n<p>There are some who declare that the issue is the degredation of civil relationships; it is animalistic to introduce physical violence to a conversation, and this is an independant prohibition (see Parach Mateh Aharon, Mada, p.6).</p>\n<p>If we hold that such a person is a Rasha, then they will be disqualified for testimony, especially if it is the latter reasoning that we adopt. The Rama rules that someone who does this is allowed to be a witness <em>d'oraisa</em>, it is nonetheless a rabbinic prohibition (some disagree, e.g. R Shlomo of Lublin, quoting R Moshe Mintz, Responsa Maharah MiLublin 89).</p>\n<p>R Yehoshua Falk, in Sefer Me'irat Einayim cites the Mordechai that although it is a biblical prohibition, there are no lashes. R Shmuel Rozovsky (Chiddushei R Shmuel on Sanhedrin 12) holds that it is <em>not d'oraisa</em>, and the status of Rasha is not literal (the pasuk is just an <em>asmachta</em>).</p>\n<p>R Yoel Sirkes on the Tur (Bayit Chadash, Choshen Mishpat 34) cites the Rambam and holds that it is indeed <em>d'oraisa</em>, and R Yehoshua DiTrani also holds this way (Responsa Maharit Even HaEzer 43 - note the objection of R Yosef Shaul Nathanson, Responsa Shoel Umeishiv, Mahadura Tinyana 2:70), and R Yaacov Veil takes this further and says there is indeed lashes (Responsa Mahari Veil 28).</p>\n<p>R Menachem Mendel uses the later to question if a shochet should be removed from his position if he does this (Responsa Tzemach Tzedek CM Shaar Hamiluim 15). R Yehudah HaChasid states that the ban of excommunication that applies to actually hitting someone also applies to someone who raises his hand to do so (See SA CM 420:2, and Sefer MeIrat Einayim 4).</p>\n\n\n",

How exactly was he, as a first step, to self-strengthen?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5b.16?lang=bi&with=Ben%20Yehoyada&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada</a> has a lot of kabbalistic explanations of what הב לי ידך\nואוקמיה וכו means and what method was used to heal. Although the Ben Yehoyada's comment seems to be going on the story of Rebbi Elazar and Rebbi Yochanan, he discusses the story of Rebbi Chiyah bar Abba and Rebbi Yochanan in his explanation. I'll provide the first explanation of the Ben Yehoyada which most people will understand much more than the other explanations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה לי בס\"ד דידוע החולי הוא מסיבת הדינין שלא נמתקו, וידוע כי הדינין הם מצד שמאל, ונמתקים בחסדים שהם בימין, כי חמש אצבעות ימין רומזת אל חמשה חסדים, וחמש אצבעות שמאל רומזים אל חמשה גבורות, ולכן בא כנגדו פנים בפנים לעשות כונה של מיתוק הגבורות בחסדים, ואמר ליה הב לי ידך הרי נעשה שמאל רבי יוחנן בימין של רבי חייא, ושמאל של רבי חייא בימין של רבי יוחנן, ואז על ידי הכונה של המיתוק שעשה בשרשים למעלה על ידי פועל דמיוני זה שעשה בידים, נתמתקו הדינין ונסתלק החולי ואוקמיה, ומקשי בגמרא ליקום רבי יוחנן לנפשיה כלומר הוא לבדו מעצמו יעשה הכונה של המיתוק הנזכר, בפועל דמיוני שבידים שלו, כי גם אצלו יש ימין ושמאל, ויתן זה כנגד זה, ויכוין בהם ומשני אין חבוש וכו'. והנה בספרי הקטן ברכת אבות הבאתי מדברי מהרח\"ו ז\"ל בשער רוח הקודש שכתב על רבינו הארי ז\"ל, שהיה יודע מן הדפק של האדם בחולי הנפש ומה הפגם אשר עשה, ובזה פירשתי בס\"ד שם מה שאמר התנא כל המזכה את הרבים אין חטא בא על ידו, יעוין שם, והנה בהקדמה הנזכר יבואר נמי היטב המאמר כאן, דאמר ליה הַב לִי יָדָךְ, שרצה לבדוק בדפק כדרך הרופא לידע בו מן ענייני הנפש.</p>\n<p>\"It is known that illness results from judgments (dinim) that have not\nbeen sweetened. It is also known that these judgments originate from\nthe left side and are sweetened through acts of kindness (chesed)\nwhich are associated with the right side. The five fingers of the\nright hand symbolize five acts of kindness, while the five fingers of\nthe left hand represent five acts of judgment (gevurot). Therefore, by\nplacing the hands opposite each other, face to face, the intention is\nto sweeten the judgments through acts of kindness.</p>\n<p>When Rabbi Yochanan said, \"Give me your hand,\" it was to place Rabbi\nChiyya’s left hand in Rabbi Yochanan's right hand and Rabbi Yochanan’s\nleft hand in Rabbi Chiyya's right hand. Through the intention of\nsweetening that Rabbi Yochanan performed in the spiritual roots above,\nusing this symbolic action with their hands, the judgments were\nsweetened, the illness was removed, and Rabbi Chiyya was healed.</p>\n<p>The Gemara raises a question: why didn’t Rabbi Yochanan perform this\nact for himself? Meaning, why didn’t he himself, on his own, perform\nthe intention of sweetening the judgments with his own hands, since he\nalso had a right and left hand? The Gemara answers with the phrase, \"A\nprisoner cannot free himself from prison,\" indicating that one cannot\nalways apply the necessary spiritual remedy to oneself.</p>\n<p>In my humble work, \"Birkat Avot,\" I brought the words of Rav Chaim\nVital in \"Shaar Ruach HaKodesh,\" where he wrote about our master, the\nArizal who was able to determine, by feeling a person’s pulse, the\nstate of their soul and the spiritual flaw they had caused. Using this\nintroduction, the statement here in the Gemara, \"Give me your hand,\"\ncan also be explained well. Rabbi Yochanan wished to check Rabbi\nChiyya’s pulse, as a doctor would, to understand the condition of his\nsoul.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Look at the Ben Yehoyada there for a few other explanations.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# First person in Dev 2:17 forward\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Devarim 2, Moshe recounts certain historical events. Pasuk 17 begins with Moshe retelling what Hashem told him and, therefore, at least initially, the first person is Hashem's voice (\" כִּ֣י לֹֽא־אֶ֠תֵּ֠ן\n\" in pasuk 19, for example).</p>\n<p>By pasuk 23, the text speaks of Hashem in the third person (\"כַּאֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשָׂה֙ לִבְנֵ֣י עֵשָׂ֔ו\" -- as HE did to...)\n\". In 24 and 25 there is a first person speaking, taking credit for inspiring fear in the hearts of the enemies (\"רְאֵ֣ה נָתַ֣תִּי בְ֠יָדְךָ֠\" and \"אָחֵל֙ תֵּ֤ת פַּחְדְּךָ֙\") so the \"you\" is (I think) the nation, and the first person speaker is Moshe and he is taking credit for preparing the way for the nation's victory. Or maybe, it is Hashem preparing people with the fear OF Moshe (and Hashem is the 1st person speaker and the fear is of the \"you\", Moshe).</p>\n<p>But then starting in pasuk 26, there are a series of singular verbs (\"וָאֶשְׁלַ֤ח\" \",אֶעְבְּרָ֣ה,\" \"אָס֖וּר,\" \"<strong>וְאָכַ֔לְתִּי</strong> וּמַ֛יִם בַּכֶּ֥סֶף תִּתֶּן־לִ֖י <strong>וְשָׁתִ֑יתִי</strong> רַ֖ק <strong>אֶעְבְּרָ֥ה</strong> בְרַגְלָֽי׃) which make it seem that the requester of permission to cross is a single person, Moshe. There is a subtle move back to the plural next, \"עָֽשׂוּ־<strong>לִ֜י</strong> בְּנֵ֣י עֵשָׂ֗ו הַיֹּֽשְׁבִים֙ בְּשֵׂעִ֔יר וְהַמּ֣וֹאָבִ֔ים הַיֹּשְׁבִ֖ים בְּעָ֑ר עַ֤ד אֲשֶֽׁר־<strong>אֶֽעֱבֹר֙</strong> אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ נֹתֵ֥ן <em><strong>לָֽנוּ</strong></em>\".</p>\n<p>By pasuk 30, there is an attempt to clarify \"לְמַ֛עַן תִּתּ֥וֹ בְיָדְךָ֖\" with the second person seeming to be the nation. The next pasuk then reintroduces nouns and numbers in a different direction.</p>\n<p>Why would the request section be so explicitly singular? Is Moshe just asking for permission for HIMSELF? Is he making the point that the enemy is so evil, it wouldn't even allow one person to cross its land? Is he inconsistently using the singular for the nation?</p>\n<p>Note -- one of the meforshim actually exacerbates the confusion!

Alternatively, Hashem indicates that action of wiping out the Refaim from lands of Ammon (and earlier Moav), Horites from Seir, and Avvim from Gaza revealed the same name of G-d who took out Jewish people from Mitzraim. It is better to be surrounded for Jewish people by nations like Ammon, Moav, Edom, and Pilistia, rather than giants.

The posuk later on instructs the people to turn north, e.g. towards Yerushalayim.</p>\n<p>What was the deeper reason why B'nei Yisroel would need to encircle Har Seir?</p>\n<p>In several places in Tanach, for example in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.14.14?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei HaYamim 1, 14:14</a>, we read that G-d said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Do not go up after them, but circle around them and confront them at the baca trees.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So maybe circling around Har Seir was in order to battle the impurity, e.g. Esav, e.g. Edom?</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any meforshim or other sources that explain specifically why they needed to encircle Har Seir?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question can probably be answered by similarity with another reference to <em>har Seir</em>. In <em>parashas Vayishlach</em> Yaakov parts ways with Eisav indicating that he will go in the direction of <em>har Seir</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.33.13-16?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 33:13-16</a>). Yaakov's excuse: <em>the <strong>children</strong> are frail (הַיְלָדִ֣ים רַכִּ֔ים) and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; if they are driven hard a single day, all the flocks will die.</em> Maybe, Moshe hints to the fact that after the sin of the spies, Hashem announced the decree <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.31-32?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 14:31-32</a>: <em>Your <strong>children</strong> who, you said, would be carried off (וְטַ֨פְּכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם לָבַ֣ז יִהְיֶ֑ה) — these will I allow to enter; they shall know the land that you have rejected. But your carcasses shall drop in this wilderness.</em> The generation of the desert lost its <em>Olam haBa</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 10:3</a>). In other words they could throw away their yoke and die. They did not. They still made sacrifices to raise a new generation which merited <em>Eretz Israel</em> to show their connection to Hashem and our forefathers. Only in the future we have prophesy <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Obadiah.1.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ovadia 1:21</a>  with regards to judgement/arrival to har Eisav.</p>\n<p>There are other ideas that are mentioned in the sources. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.1?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv mentions</a> it is a hint (remez) to us that in the end the exile migrations will take most of the time in the exile of Edom. And the nearby (verses 3-4) explain this clue more clearly, that in the Galut Edom we should avoid direct confrontation with Eisav (Devarim Rabba 1:19)</p>\n<p>Because there are lots of midrashim in Devarim Rabba on verses 2:3-4, many commentaries discuss them directly and avoid looking at Devarim 2:1.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.3?lang=bi&with=Kli%20Yakar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kli Yakar summarizes some of the midrashim</a>: Many say that this verse (Devarim 2:3)...has a hint for that time and for the future. This idea of “going around” refers to the many years which the Jewish People will be wandering (in exile). As long as Israel is in exile they are told, “turn to the Tzafon” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.3?lang=bi&with=Kli%20Yakar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ending of the verse 2:3</a>). The rabbis interpreted this to mean, “If the time of (the nation of) Esau comes, hide yourselves. (ed.- The root of the word for North, Tzafon, can also mean “to hide”). This idea of hiding means that if a Jewish person in exile finds some small amount of success he should hide it from (the people of) Esau, because there is no nation which is more jealous of Israel than Esau, because in their opinion everything (the Israel has) is stolen from Esau because Jacob our forefather took the blessings from Esau.</p>\n\n\n",

Take as an example people voting for the president of their country, with the candidates having diametrically opposing policies. Presumably, the outcome can influence the direction of world history, which is something we would expect G-d to be deciding and to be in His domain (and not something left to the whims of any group of people). Yet at the same time, each individual vote is an exercise of free will (or so we presume, since if it's not, then why bother casting the vote?).</p>\n<p>The question then arises on how a collection of free choices can simultaneously add up to a pre-desired (by G-d) outcome necessary for implementing how He wants world's events to unfold?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Looking at the micro level Person A can decide to go vote for Candidate A.

The book of Iyov does not seem to have any connection to the destruction of the Temple which is being mourned on Tisha b'Av nor does it have any connection to any other sad event in Jewish history. The majority of the book are a series of arguments between Iyov and his friends regarding how God administers punishment in the world.</p>\n<p>I would like to understand why learning this book is permitted on Tisha b'Av.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Cohen_of_Vienna\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Avidor Kohen Tzedek</a> writes (somewhere in the first 2 chapters on Eichah, that's all I did yesterday) that the Jews didn't know why Hashem destroyed the Bet Hamikdash (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.85b.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 85b</a>). Therefore one can learn Iyov which teaches that not all tragedies are (easily) explainable.</p>\n<p>Another possible answer is Iyov is essentially a mussar book. This maybe the source <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46440&st=&pgnum=88\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that one can learn mussar on 9 Av</a>.

It is allowed to be learned because Job describes the travesty befallen on Job, which is definitely saddening in some way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The reason we may study Job on Tish'a b'Av is to remind ourselves of this line in Pirkei Avot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yannai said: it is not in our hands to understand either of the security of the wicked or the afflictions of the righteous.

While many modern scholars suggest it was one of multiple species of ocean mollusk, we don't truly know for certain what animal it was.</p>\n<p>There have been a few groups in Israel and abroad who claim to have identified the creature used to produce the dye.

Typically referred to as a sea snail.</p>\n<p>This narrows the choice down to maybe 3 or so shell bodied mollusks which produce a similar blue/purple dye. The problem we run into is \"which one?\"</p>\n<p>If we know for certain it HAS to be at least one of these only creatures which fits the description, wouldn't the most appropriate solution be to mix the dyes of all 3 of these creatures together to produce a dye which is as close to the original as realistically possible?</p>\n<p>Think about it. If you produce a dye which is 3 equal parts of the 3 most likely candidates for the dye, you would be 100% guaranteed to be using the correct dye even if it is partially adulterated with a cousin species of similar property.</p>\n<p>The final product would be a dye which in all likelihood is the correct source.

    "content": "# Why doesn’t Rabbi Akiva use this verse instead?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.24b.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 24b</a>, Rabbi Akiva famously comforts the sages who see foxes roaming the ruins of the Temple by saying “now that Uriah’s prophecy of the plowing of Jerusalem is fulfilled, I know Zechariah’s prophecy of the rebirth of the city will also be fulfilled.”</p>\n<p>My question is, the rabbis were specifically crying over seeing foxes on the Temple. Rabbi Akiva should’ve quoted Eicha 5:18, which clearly states that foxes will roam the Temple, as his first pasuk of a nevuah of tragedy occurring, and then quote the Zechariah verse. Wouldn’t this pasuk from Eicha which literally mentions the foxes have been more appropriate in this context?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer to the question, as noted in the comments, is that Megilath <em>Eikha</em> is written by <em>ruach hakodesh</em> as a book from <em>Kethuvim</em> and is not actual prophesy, whereas the verses quoted are from the books of <em>neviim</em>.</p>\n<p>The comments raised a number of other points which seem to be addressed by the last commentary of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.24b.4?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafoth on Makoth 24b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva states that the prophesy of Uriyah “Therefore, for your sake Zion shall be plowed...\" are found only in the book of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Micah.3.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Micah 3:12</a> and we do not find them to be said by Uriyah. We can explain that the sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.26.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 26:20</a> describes how Yirmiyahu prophesized about destruction of the Beith haMikdash, so that the <em>kohanim</em>, the false prophets, and the rest of the nation were angry with him for these prophesies. They wanted to kill Yirmiyahu. Then finally several men among the elders (<em>ziknei ha'am</em>) defended Yirmiyahu and said that already Micha spoke about destruction in the days of king Chizkiyahu \"Zion shall be plowed\" and he was not killed. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.26.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elders added that</a> \"<em>There was also a man prophesying in the name of G-D, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-yearim (1), who prophesied against this city and this land the same things as Jeremiah</em>.\" The implication is that Uriyah said something similar to what Micha did and that is why the prophesy in the Gemara is designated in the name of Uriyah <em>son of Shemaiah</em>.</p>\n<p>There is a difficulty with understanding why Rabbi Akiva is bringing the prophesy of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.8.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zekhariya 8:4</a> \"<em>There shall yet be elderly men and elderly women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem!</em>” It was made during the Second Beith haMikdash (BhM\"K), and by the time of Rabbi Akiva the Temple was destroyed. Thus, the prophesy was not fulfilled (Beeroth haMaim). Are the words of Zekhariah about the World to Come or about this world prior to <em>Geula</em>/Redemption, and how would Rabbi Akiva be comforted with verses of redemption that will be fulfilled? The answer can be found from masekheth Pesachim, second part of which is called <em>Pesach Sheini</em>. On <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.68a.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>daf</em> 68a</a> <em>gemara</em> explains <em>gzerah shaveh</em> regarding this verse by using the connection מִשְׁעַנְתּוֹ and מִשְׁעַנְתִּי:</p>\n<p>\"<em>This idea is derived from a different source as well. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: In the future the righteous will resurrect the dead, as it is stated: “Old men and old women shall yet again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his <strong>staff</strong> in his hand for very age” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.8.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariah 8:4</a>). And the staff will then be used as it was used by Gehazi when Elisha sent him to bring the son of the Shunamite woman back to life, as it is written: “And you shall lay my <strong>staff</strong> on the face of the child” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.4.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Kings 4:29</a>).</em>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. just like Elisha brought life to the dead child, so the verse is speaking about the time of Revival of the Dead, which is for sure after BhM\"K 1 and BhM\"K 2. MaHaRSh\"A adds here that rabbi Akiva also saw that G-d made sure that nobody could have <em>nachath ruach</em> in the land until the time of redemption, even the foxes.</p>\n<p>In other words, it looks good to refer to the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.8.1-4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 8:1-4</a> who mentions two witnesses of redemption <em>kohein</em> Uriyah and <em>kohein</em> Zekhariahu. However, Tosafos does not go this way, even though the fathers of the witness Zekhariyahu and the prophet Zekhariah seem to have the same name. That's a pretty but an unfortunate trap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) According to Seder haDoros, Year 3298, Uriah ben Shemaya was a kohein from a low status family. Furthemore, the story in Yirmiyahu 26 tells that that king Yehoiakim wanted to kill Uriah. Uriyah ran to Egypt. Agents of Yehoiakim found him there and brought him back. King Yohoiakim killed Uriah by the sword. I.e. the gemara brings the memory of Uriah's sacrifice by mentioning his name, rather than Micha.</p>\n\n\n",

The \"Moses not asking directions\" is a famous joke, but just a joke.</p>\n<p>The 40 years in the desert were a punishment decreed early-on; once the years were up, G-d said \"okay, time to start entering the land.\" The people in that year didn't need to cry out. And they were never \"lost.\" During those 40 years, they were <em>ordered/directed</em> where to go in the desert -- it just wasn't the way they wished to go.</p>\n<p>Psalm 107 <em>does</em> describe people who should give thanks after dangerous ordeals. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.7.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 7:12</a> describes a \"thanks\" offering (<em>korban todah</em>). Today instead we recite <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/birkat-hagomel-a-jewish-prayer-of-gratitude/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birkat HaGomel</a> publicly in synagogue. The linkage between Psalm 107 and the requirement to publicly give thanks appears in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.54b.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud, Berachot 54b</a> (I'm just pasting Sefaria's translation here):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַב יְהוּדָה אָמַר רַב: אַרְבָּעָה צְרִיכִין לְהוֹדוֹת: יוֹרְדֵי\nהַיָּם, הוֹלְכֵי מִדְבָּרוֹת, וּמִי שֶׁהָיָה חוֹלֶה וְנִתְרַפֵּא,\nוּמִי שֶׁהָיָה חָבוּשׁ בְּבֵית הָאֲסוּרִים וְיָצָא.  Rav Yehuda said\nthat Rav said: Four must offer thanks to God with a thanks-offering\nand a special blessing. They are: Seafarers, those who walk in the\ndesert, and one who was ill and recovered, and one who was\nincarcerated in prison and went out. All of these appear in the verses\nof a psalm (Psalms 107).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud continues...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוֹלְכֵי מִדְבָּרוֹת מְנָלַן? דִּכְתִיב: ״תָּעוּ בַמִּדְבָּר\nבִּישִׁימוֹן דָּרֶךְ עִיר מוֹשָׁב לֹא מָצָאוּ … וַיִּצְעֲקוּ אֶל ה׳ …\nוַיַּדְרִיכֵם בְּדֶרֶךְ יְשָׁרָה … יוֹדוּ לַה׳ חַסְדּוֹ״.  The Gemara\nasks: From where do we derive that those who walk in the desert are\nrequired to thank God? The Gemara answers:  As it is written in the\nsame psalm:  “They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they\nfound no city in which to dwell” (Psalms 107:4), “And then they cried\nunto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their\ndistresses.  And He led them forth by the right way” (Psalms 107:6–7).\nAfter God guides them on the right way, it is said: “They are grateful\nto God for His goodness” (Psalms 107:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you look in the context of Psalm 107, it is (as the Talmud notes) describing four categories of people going through a dangerous ordeal. Seafarers, the seriously ill, those traveling in the wilderness, and those imprisoned. The Jews of the desert were clearly not seafarers, so it would be very odd for one-quarter of this Psalm to be a historical reference to one particular group of desert-goers, when the other thirds are about people in general.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.107.1?lang=he&with=Malbim&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim's commentary</a> does put these verses into context. Chapter 106 ends with a prayer that the Jews be \"gathered from the nations\", back to Israel. Chapter 107 therefore continues: <em>upon returning from exile from north, south, east, and west</em>, they will thank G-d. <em>Now additionally</em>, those who go through the wilderness, or illness, etc. will thank G-d. (Alternatively: upon the ingathering of the Jews, they will thank G-d for all the dangerous occasions they survived.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kiddushin - Jewish male actor saying \"harei at...\" to a Jewish female actor (in Shtisel or anywhere else)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Season 2 of Shtisel (episode 04 or 05), a young boy (Hanina) marries a 15-year-old girl (Ruchami) in a cholent shop before 2 kosher eidim (witnesses) by reciting \"Harei at mekudeshet li.\" (I think he also gives her a ring.)</p>\n<p>The actors, Yoav Rotman and Shira Haas, are both Jewish, as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>In the show, the couple are now officially married because he's fulfilled the minimum requirement for Kiddushin. But when I explained this to one of my kids, she said, \"What about the actors? Doesn't that mean they're married now in real life???\"</p>\n<p>I'm genuinely quite curious... thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch (EH 42:1) provides one of the criteria for Kiddushin - halachic marriage - 'אין האשה מתקדשת אלא לרצונה'; a woman cannot become married without her consent. Assuming that her intentions are for staging a movie but not actual marriage, there would be no halachic marriage.</p>\n<p>However, the Rema adds an important caveat for staged marriages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגה: אמרה תחלה קדשני וזרק קדושין לתוך חיקה ואמר לה הרי את מקודשת לי,\nונערה בגדיה תוך כדי דבור להשליך ממנה הקדושין, ואומרת שלא כונה מתחלה רק\nלשחוק בעלמא, אפילו הכי הוי מקודשת (תשובת מוהר\"ם סוף ספר נשים). ואין\nהולכים בענין קדושין אחר אמדנות והוכחות המוכיחות שלא כונה לשם קדושין\n(שם).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rema writes that even when the woman had no intention for Kiddushin and 'played along' for שחוק - just for gags - the Kiddushin is valid, because <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%91_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9D_%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דברים שבלב לא הוי דברים</a>. Even if there are contextual hints ['אמדנות והוכחות'] that she didn't intend for Kiddushin, it would still be valid. Accepting the Rema at face value, the marriage between the actors would be valid.</p>\n<p>However, the Poskim qualify the ruling of the Rema so that it isn't applicable in all cases. Here are some reasons the ruling of the Rema wouldn't apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Rema discusses where the <em>woman</em> was attempting to prank, but the man was serious. According to Biur HaGra (and the original ruling of Maharam Rottenberg), the <em>chumra</em> is based on <em>itsa bkol d'hu nicha lkiddushin</em>; this does not apply to the <em>mekadesh</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to many Poskim (see Otzar Poskim 42:11:5; Igros Moshe EH 82, Chazon Ish EH 52:3), if the circumstances were <strong>clearly</strong> staged and evident to the witnesses that it was not intended to be valid, it wouldn't be דברים שבלב either, and the Kiddushin would not be valid.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the ruling of the Rema and Maharam miRotenberg was always only an added <em>chumra</em> due to the severity of <em>eishes ish</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are other reasons the above scenario may not constitute a halachic marriage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If either party would have declared in front of witnesses that they have no intention to marry, then the <em>moda'ah</em> would invalidate the subsequent <em>kiddushin</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the ring did not belong to the <em>mekadesh</em>, the <em>kiddushin</em> would be invalid. [This would be true even according to Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%9B%D7%97_%D7%99%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">28:19</a>) that Kiddushin is valud if one borrows a ring with the specified intention to perform a Kiddushin with it; I think that would not apply when the lender doesn't think the Kiddushin is intended to be valid].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the witnesses are not Kosher, there is no Kiddushin. [It's beyond the scope of this answer to provide a full treatise of who is a valid witness. Noteworthy for discussion is whether irreligious Jews would count as valid witnesses if they are <em>tinok shenishba</em>]</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is the possibility that in real life \"Ruchami\" is a married woman, in which case \"Hanina's\" play-acting cannot be valid. Otherwise, the point made above about the ring not belonging to him is an extremely valid point.\nAs to the point mentioned above about the actors not caring as they aren't religious. They might not mind (who says?), but if this \"marriage\" would be considered a real kidushin, and then the real \"Ruchami\" would get married to someone else and have children, those children would be mamzerim, which is something we definitely have to be aware off, especially as we all hope they would at one stage in their life, do Tshuvah!</p>\n\n\n",

Repeating the thought a few times over Shabbos can work.</p>\n<p>If one has a short memory and one needs to remember a <em>vort</em>, a thought, or an idea, one could try to remember by association. To build association, one can place a book in a wrong but visible spot and state (mentally or out loud) a specific sentence related to the thought that needs to be remembered. It is also good to repeat the sentence few hours later when looking at the misplaced book, and again few hours later if necessary. One can use a cup or other non-muktzeh object. This way after Shabbos, when looking at the misplaced object one will remember what needs to be recalled due to the built association.</p>\n<p>If one needs to remember several ideas - one may need to build several associations.</p>\n<p>I found one of the hardest things to remember is the rabbi's speech in the synagogue during shabbos or a holiday. The problem comes with kiddush, social speaking, and long conversations during meals on other topics, which fully divert attention and erase the memory. To remember, one can try repeating important points after prayer, also try to speak with people on the subject that needs to be remembered, and of course, try to speak about the idea by the meal afterwards. Repetition builds necessary traces in memory and makes the ideas easy to recall.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said to Rav: And say that the verse means that he fulfilled only the seven Noahide mitzvot and not the entire Torah. The Gemara asks: But isn’t there also circumcision that Abraham clearly observed, which is not one of the Noahide laws? Apparently, Abraham fulfilled more than just those seven. The Gemara asks: And say that he fulfilled only the seven mitzvot and circumcision. Rav said to him: If so, why do I need the continuation of the verse, that Abraham kept: My mitzvot and My Torah? That is a clear indication that he fulfilled mitzvot beyond the seven Noahide mitzvot, and apparently fulfilled the entire Torah. Rav said, and some say Rav Ashi said: Abraham our Patriarch fulfilled the entire Torah, even the mitzva of the joining of cooked foods, a rabbinic ordinance instituted later, as it is stated: My Torahs. Since the term is in the plural, it indicates that Abraham kept two Torahs; one, the Written Torah, and one, the Oral Torah.

King Nimrod, based on the recommendation of his Astrologers, wanted to murder the so to be born son of Terach. To avoid his newborn son being discovered by King Nimrod, Terach sent his wife, <em><strong>Amatlaye</strong>, the daughter of</em> <em><strong>Kerenebo</strong></em> (<em>An allusion to the <strong>Essence of Har Nebo</strong>, the place from which Moshe Rabbeinu, in the future, would gaze in order to see the land of Israel.</em>) , her nursemaid and the newborn Avram into hiding. The details of this story are found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaYashar_(midrash)%2C_Book_of_Genesis%2C_Noach.8-11?lang=en&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaYashar, parshat Noach 8-11</a>.</p>\n<p>Like with Adam following the sin of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, G-d sent the angel <strong>Raziel</strong> רזיאל (A name meaning <em><strong>Secret of G-d</strong></em>, alluding to <em><strong>the secret of Reward and Punishment</strong></em>. That the reward for the negative precepts is spiritual reward pertaining to the World of Souls and the reward for the positive precepts, which pertain to the material, physical body, is the bodily reward of resurrection.) to teach Avram the whole Torah directly.</p>\n<p>That originally <em><strong>the revealed aspect of Torah</strong></em>, meaning what people must adhere to, was only about <em><strong>the negative precepts</strong></em>, the prohibitions. <em>Do not transgress and violate these prohibited things.</em> <em><strong>The concealed or inner aspect of the Torah</strong></em> related to <em><strong>the positive precepts</strong></em>. This is hinted at through the gematria of the angel's name which is 248 corresponding to the 248 positive commandments which correspond to the 248 limbs of the male body.</p>\n<p>All of these 248 positive commandments can be learned from the text of the written Torah when applying all the <em><strong>rules of grammar</strong></em>. (<em>Grammar in the broadest sense</em> meaning all aspects of <em>Crowns, Trop, Nekudot, and Letters, Notarikon, Gematria and all the letter transformations.</em>) That specifically, the ten utterances in Bereshit correspond to the ten commandments that were given at Mount Sinai. And encoded within the ten commandments (and also the ten utterances) are all of the negative and positive precepts.</p>\n<p>And it is in this sense that so too, when Avraham had mastered all aspects of the 248 positive precepts of the Torah (<em><strong>his ten trials</strong></em>), that his name was changed from Avram אברם to Avraham אברהם, which is also gematria 248. The symbol of his completion and mastery was <em><strong>the first positive precept</strong></em> of <em><strong>the covenant of Milah</strong></em> (circumcision).</p>\n<p>The next detail you are asking about is the idea of Avraham's relationship to the 7 commandments of Noach in contrast to the 613 commandments of the Torah. The general concept is like is mentioned above, the commandments of Noach are all expressed as negative precepts, prohibitions. The revelation of the positive precepts began with the positive commandment of Milah. But Avraham and the the other Patriarchs and Matriarchs <em>performed the other positive precepts <strong>on a spiritual level</strong></em>. From the descriptions within the Torah and associated midrashim, this appears to be related primarily to <em>the Kavanot, <strong>the intentions</strong></em> related to particular acts or events.</p>\n<p>For example the discussion of Yaacov Avinu and the sticks with the sheep of Lavan at the watering trough. <em><strong>The actions with the sticks</strong></em> pertained to <em><strong>the precepts of Tefillin</strong></em>. But because they were only on the level of the intentions, the sticks used by Yaacov retained no aspect of Holiness קדושה afterward, unlike with actual Tefillin.</p>\n<p>There is also discussion of where, geographically, the Patriarchs and Matriarchs were at specific times. That while in the Land of Israel, they were focused on the spiritual intentions. But outside the land of israel, under the dominion of those influences, they focused on adherence to the revealed aspect of the precepts for that time, meaning the commandments of Noach.</p>\n<p>The third detail you touch on is whether and when Avram went to and attended the Yeshivah of Shem and Ever.</p>\n<p>This occurred when Avram was ten years old, when he, his mother and his nursemaid finally departed from hiding in the cave. They went from there to the household of Noach, where Shem lived in order to study Torah as it had been transmitted to Adam from the angel Raziel, to his son Seth and his decendents until Noach and his son Shem.</p>\n<p>This too is detailed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaYashar_(midrash)%2C_Book_of_Genesis%2C_Noach.12?lang=en&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Yashar, parshat Noach, 12</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All the reishonim who discuss how Avraham Avinu knew the Torah, dont say he got it from yeshivas noach.

What the Book of Genealogy actually contained is disputed (it may have been a sort of Midrash on Chronicles; see Rashi there and other sources cited on <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9F_(%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Wikipedia</a>). According to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38272&st=&pgnum=208\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Amram Gaon</a>, the Book of Genealogy contained historical and genealogical information about various families.</p>\n<p>At the time of the Mishnah and Talmud, genealogical information was still preserved, but it was transmitted orally. An example of this information is in the Mishnah (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97_%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eduyot 8:7</a>) where the positive information is given with the family name, but the negative information is anonymized. This was either because of danger, either on the part of the families involved or the Roman government, or so as not to publicly disparage families whose disqualifications had been forgotten (see Bartenura and Tosafot Yom Tov there). The negative information was only to be transmitted in private once or twice every seven years (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 71a</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the deeper explanation of this passage in Iggeret Hakodesh (According to true Kabbalah or Chassidic explanation)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>BH</p>\n<p>Hi, so I started to read the Ramban's Iggeret Hakodesh's chapter on the intention of union trying to understand a  specific section from of it. It says..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ben Azzai was sitting and learning and a fire started to burn around him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramban quotes another example in the Iggeret and says that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>similarly Rabbi Eliezer was sitting and explaining the words of Torah and light was beaming from him like Moses our teacher peace be upon him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So he says at the end</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These things have one meaning to them. Know that though a spring of\nwater naturally flows from a high place to a lower one there is a\npower capable of raising the water to a different place higher than\nwhere it has flowed from. It is also known to the masters of Kabbalah\nthat thought of man comes from the spiritual source of the rational\nsoul which is drawn from the upper spheres and there is a power in the\nthought to expand and rise and reach its highest source and upon\narriving at its source it can cleave to <em>the Mystery of Elyon</em>, that from there, <em>She</em> and <em>He</em> flow and become one. And when the\nthought returns below from above it becomes similar to a single ray\nand that supernal light is drawn downward and the power of the thought\nthat draws it downward and the light of the luminescence is drawn down\nand spreads in that place where the person is thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what does it mean \"Know that though a spring of water naturally flows from a high place to a lower one there is a power capable of raising the water to a different place higher than where it has flowed from.\" What is this analogy and what is it analogous to really? What is the power hes talking about in the analogy and what is it reffering to?</p>\n<p>What does it mean \"It is also known to the masters of Kabbalah that thought of man comes from the spiritual source of the rational soul which is drawn from the upper spheres\" What is the source of this? Also it seems to imply that the spiritual source of the rational soul causes the thoughts to become somthing of its own (meaning the spiritual source of the rational soul is the one who has the dominion of the the thought it self to create it etc also seems like the spiritual source of the rational soul also somehow  draws the thought from the upper spheres as well.</p>\n<p>If so though what does it mean \"and there is a power in the thought to expand and rise and reach its highest source? How is this possihle as it was just said that the thought of man comes from the spiritual source of the rational soul as is someone really going to say that the thought some how gets disconnected that it has its own power to rise up to its source on it's own?</p>\n<p>Also when it said earlier that the thought of man comes from the spiritual source of the rational soul which is drawn from the upper spheres what is the spiritual source of the rational soul really? What spheres is he speaking about and where are the spheres located?</p>\n<p>And then it says \"and upon arriving at its source it can adhere to the upper secret from where it came from and she the thought and the thinker become one.\" So who is the thinker is it the man, Hashem, the spiritual root of the rational soul, the upper spheres or is the thought it self?</p>\n<p>Finaly it says \"And when the thought returns below from above it becomes similar to a single ray and that supernal light is drawn downward..\"</p>\n<p>In essence, How come it rises up and then down? How is this thought created Who creates it? How does it go up to a level higher than where it came from? How to make it go to a level higher than it came from? How does it go down again? How come it goes down again? Is the power to bring it up also have to put effort to bring it down or does it just automatically go down? How come he speaks about the thought as it's independent? Also Does all this have something to do with the subconsious?</p>\n<p>Picture of the part from the Safer:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/itod6BYj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/itod6BYj.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2EcjBNM6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2EcjBNM6.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In order to keep the length of this answer manageable, the effort will  be to stick with the allegory used by the Ramban.</p>\n<p>He is comparing the analog, (the intellect שכל (the intellectual aspect of soul), meaning השכליות, which is comprised of the four aspects, or brains called: Keter כתר, Wisdom חכמה, Understanding בינה and <em>applied</em> knowledge דעת), to the allegory, (to a Wellspring (<em>of living water</em>) מעין מים חיים.) That Mayim Chayim מים חיים is a Notarikon for Brains מח meaning מוחין.</p>\n<p>Like is observed with all water, one aspect is its natural tendency or behavioral trait to flow from a higher elevation to a lower elevation.</p>\n<p>So too with the analog, the intellect. The higher, more refined aspects of intellect flow from higher to lower, from Keter to Chochmah to Binah to Da'at.</p>\n<p>But <em><strong>the source</strong></em> (המקור of the Living Water) is <em><strong>the Wellspring</strong></em>, itself. The Wellspring המעין is in the Earth בתוך הארץ.</p>\n<p>That הארץ is linguistically related to <strong>Supernal <em>Will</em></strong> הרצון העליון. That רצון relates to the Earth and עליון is referring to G-d's feminine name צלמו, <em>the Queen of Heaven</em> (which is gematria 166. That עליון equals צלמו.).</p>\n<p>That the earth הארץ surrounds (meaning it is מקיף היינו סובב to) the source המעין. And מעין which is gematria 820, (when counting the final Nun as 700,) alludes the Great Name (שמה רבא) mentioned in Kaddish, like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.36.23?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 36:23</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְקִדַּשְׁתִּ֞י אֶת־שְׁמִ֣י הַגָּד֗וֹל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That וקדשתי is also gematria 820. This Great Name is also alluded to in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.9.32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 9:32.</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמַאֲמַ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֔ר קִיַּ֕ם דִּבְרֵ֥י הַפֻּרִ֖ים הָאֵ֑לֶּה וְנִכְתָּ֖ב בַּסֵּֽפֶר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That ונכתב בספר, which is equated with מאמר אסתר, is also gematria 820. That what is written comes via the Queen.</p>\n<p>And it should be noted that the gematria of מעין when including the kollel for the word is 821, which is gematria אחשורוש, the King of Megillat Esther.</p>\n<p>That like Ramban quoted in your question states, <em>From the Mystery of Elyon, She and He flow and become one.</em></p>\n<p>שמשם (סוד העליון) נמשכת ונעשית היא והוא דבר אחד</p>\n<p>That the <em>Living Water</em> מים חיים flows upward from its <em>source in Supernal Will</em> המעין שבארץ to be revealed in this corporeal, material world עולם הזה הגשמי והחומרי.

Those who study Talmud and Halacha deeply know the answer, as they've witness the intellectual process of our Sages in deriving the Will of God (including <em>Chukim</em>) from the Torah - a truly remarkable process, <em>if only someone would take the time to look at it honestly and non-cynically</em>.</p>\n<p>So I presume that at least part of the answer is that one day, when God Himself confirms that He is proud and approving of the work of the \"Pharisees\" and \"Rabbinic Judaism\", people will finally be impressed at the intellectual acumen. At that time, we know there will be a thirst for knowledge of God, and we also know that knowledge of God is primarily through His Laws (including <em>Chukim</em>), and therefore they will be so so impressed at the amount of knowledge of God the Jewish people have generated through their study, and under the conditions that they were subjected to!</p>\n<p>On top of that, they will see how it is those very laws themselves (including <em>Chukim</em>) that have caused the Jews to be so successful at becoming Godly, holy, and produce healthy, homes that kept our nation everlasting in said conditions.</p>\n<p>All in all, I don't see a problem here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.5?lang=bi&with=Kli%20Yakar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kli yakar</a>. He interprets the verse to mean that G-d is promising the Jewish people that <em>despite</em> the seemingly nonsensical nature of <em>chukim</em>, the esteem the nations of the world have for the Jews will not be diminished.</p>\n<p>For further reading, here is an excerpt from a piece I wrote for a local weekly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ושמרתם ועשיתם כי היא חכמתכם ובינתכם לעיני העמים אשר ישמעון את כל החוקים האלה” (דברים ד:ו)\nYou shall safeguard [them] and perform them, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the\npeoples who shall hear all these statutes…\nרש''י:בזאת תחשבו חכמים ונבונים לעיני העמים\nThrough this you will be considered wise and understanding in the eyes of the peoples. (Artscroll\nTranslation)\nIn other words, solely through keeping Hashem’s Mitzvos will we achieve prestige among non-Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Up until today there exists a fallacy that has persisted among many Jews throughout History. That is,\nthat in order to be held in high esteem among the Gentiles, we must endeavour to impress them with\nour worldliness, our sophistication, our Nobel prize record. <strong>But the Torah (and History) reveal to us that\nthe opposite is true. The more we attempt to prove ourselves to them, the less they respect us.</strong> (In the\nwords of Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, “Non-Jews respect Jews who respect their Judaism, and they are\nembarrassed by Jews who are embarrassed by their Judaism.”)\nWhat does seem a bit odd, however, is the Torah telling us this as a motive for us to keep the Torah.\n<strong>Surely the opinion of a bunch of Goyim shouldn’t be our primary motivation. Is there no better reason\nout there for us to do Mitzvos other than a bit of ego-stroking?</strong>\nThe Kli Yakar provides the answer to this, with a basic yet profound psychological insight:\nFor better or for worse, people are influenced by the opinions of others.\nSimply put, <strong>the Torah doesn’t mean to imply that the above is a reason to keep the Torah. Rather, it is\naddressing a part of our psyche that may be restricting our Avoidas Hashem - intimidated by fear of\npublic opinion.\nIt is this aspect of us that the Torah wishes to reassure that on the contrary – being a Torah-True Jew\n(TTJ) will earn us the respect of the world. (Hence the wording of the Posuk. כל החוקים – all of the\nMitzvos. The intention is to include our performance of the Mitzvos Chuki’im, such as Shatnez or Parah\nAduma, which lacking a human rationale, would seem to invite ridicule.)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe Zt”l in Likutei Sichos makes it clear that the Geula hinges on Jews feeling and\nacting as Jews in an increasingly secular world.\nIt goes without saying that we should never allow the opinions of others to dictate the way we should\nlive our lives. Secular ideals and cultures have no place in our homes and our communities. R’ Moshe\nShternbuch Shlit”a interprets the Posuk (Al Pi a Gemara in Taanis) “Eretz…” – “a land whose stones are\niron” – that our leaders need to be strong like iron, to prevent our communities falling to the winds of\nchange.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R’ Sacks adds that “Ambivalence spells the end of identity, because it cannot be passed on to our\nchildren.” Only a strong sense of mission will enable the continuity of Klal Yisroel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I.e. they were not compelled to make an action (eat, drink, procreate, etc.) based on instinct, but through a freedom of their personal sophisticated choices, unlike all other creatures. Humankind, however from the outset was not satisfied with their blessing of choice. As they sought to choose between better over good, G-d wanted that they obtain capacity to reason, to weigh pros and cons of a situation, and then expand their choices to include capacity of choosing bad over good, and willing to suffer potential consequences of such a decision.</p>\n<p>The snake <em>nachash</em>, which excited Eve, represented the capacity to use one's own intelligence to discern right from wrong, good from evil. (Similarly to how Yosef stated regarding the goblet <em>nachesh yenachesh</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 44:15</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.15?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi there</a> explains <em>used my own intelligence and logical deduction</em>.) Thus, the Tree of Knowledge was not necessarily a test, but rather means through which G-d enabled the first humans beings explore their capacity for judgement. It taught them that when they use their G-d like priviledge of reason and discernment, they by nature of their humanity will sometimes choose erroneously, and will at times perforce suffer the consequences.</p>\n<p><em>Also how was life before in Gan Eden? Was it only spiritual and not physical, e.g. the whole world was all like a fire that is in a potential way, i.e. hidden inside a coal?</em></p>\n<p>I agree that this is a separate question, one of the possible references is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.59b.22?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 59b</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

In his dialog, he has the Rabbi say (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.1.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:13</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That which you describe is religion based on speculation and system, the research of thought, but open to many doubts. Now ask the philosophers, and thou will find that they do not agree on one set of actions or one principle, since some doctrines can be established by arguments, which are only partially satisfactory, and still much less capable of being proved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And later in that section (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.1.69\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:63</a>), he pardons the Greek philosophers for their errors in that they lacked a tradition and had to rely on a second-best -- philosophical deduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is an excuse for the Philosophers. Being Grecians, science and religion did not come to them as inheritances. They belong to the descendants of Japheth, who inhabited the north, whilst that knowledge coming from Adam, and supported by the divine influence, is only to be found among the progeny of Shem, who represented the successors of Noah and constituted, as it were, his essence. This knowledge has always been connected with this essence, and will always remain so...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skipping out of our tradition and ahead to Modern Philosophy...</p>\n<p>This skepticism about the perfection of proof becomes fundamental to the Empiricists, who believed that only experience of the outside world can produce reliable knowledge. And then it really came to the fore with Immanuel Kant, who denied our ability to experience what's really \"out there\" altogether. That because everything we experience and think are shaped by pre-existing human categories, the way people work, none of it is real and objective. We only know the world of phenomena, how things look to humans, and only can reason with those more limited givens.</p>\n<p>And this progresses through the Existentialists and the Post-Moderns. So that today, in most College Liberal Arts departments, there is no concept of objective truth altogether. Never mind being able to prove things.</p>\n<p>I think the Kuzari's argument would be classified today as a kind of Reliabilism. We trust our Tradition because it comes from sources that have proved themselves reliable in the past. Which is a way to justify belief, so -- contrary to the Rambam -- today's philosophers would consider trusting a fact because you were taught it bey someone you trust would be considered knowledge.</p>\n<p>Another possible justification could be first-hand experience. And I think this happens far more often today. Someone experiences their first Shabbos. It agrees with them, provides meaning to their lives. I don't just mean the aesthetics, that they enjoyed themselves, but the experience itself -- the thing they enjoyed. Like the way mathematicians are likely to agree on what makes a proof \"beautiful\" or \"elegant\", there is an objective feature they are identifying and giving an aethetic judgement about. That math proof, or living that Shabbos, has the features one expects of truth.</p>\n<p>Or, when you learn something about the laws of property that somehow has implications in the laws of Shabbos and resolve what seemed to have been an unrelated question. Truth works like that, not invented systems. If this happens to someone when learning Torah often enough, they stop wondering whether or not they can prove the Torah is from Hashem. Or whether halakhah as we now practice it, which is largely a product of a system, is a product of the system Hashem gave us at Sinai. It seems obviously so.</p>\n<p>The experience of living Judaism as justification for the givens assumed by the Judaism lived.</p>\n<p>Speaking for myself. I do believe a philosophical proof does exist. But, just to frustrate the Rambam, I don't think we could identify it. We have too many of what Mussarists call \"<em>negi'os</em>\", personal ulterior motives, that color our vision. Our ideas of what is a self-evident given that could be used as a postulate for an argument start getting subjective as soon as we go much beyond \"x = x\". Similarly, our sense of which questions refute the whole argument or are interesting little side challenges that could be shelved for later. They all are so colored by what we want the answer to be that a person couldn't identify a solid argument for or against their position.</p>\n<p>Not when dealing with something we are so emotionally invested in as a question that changes how we live our lives.</p>\n<p>Or, to rephrase as a Truism:<br/>\nThe mind is a wonderful organ<br/>\nfor proving conclusions<br/>\nthe heart already reached.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> in Hilchot Yesodei Hatora Chapter 1, Halacha 1 says\n\"יְסוֹד הַיְסוֹדוֹת וְעַמּוּד הַחָכְמוֹת לֵידַע שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם מָצוּי רִאשׁוֹן\"  \"The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to <strong>know</strong> that there is a Prime Cause\"</p>\n<p>Apparently the Rambam holds it is a Mitzvah to prove the existence of God.</p>\n<p>The Rambam himself provides a demonstration from the science of his times to prove God.

That was also the practice of the Vilna Gaon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maaseh_Rav.159\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaseh Rav 159</a>).)</p>\n<p><strong>OK. So why not say it on the <em>motzaei shabbat</em> after <em>tish'ah be-av</em></strong>?</p>\n<p><em>Kiddush levanah</em> can only be said until the moon becomes full (approximately on the fifteenth of the month; see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.426.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 426:3</a>.) Thus when the ninth of Av falls on <em>shabbat</em> or Sunday, one cannot wait until the following <em>motzaei shabbat</em> (the night of 16th or 17th of Av) as it is very likely to be too late.</p>\n<p>Even when <em>tish'ah be'av</em> falls on Tuesday, one would not want to wait until <em>motzaei shabbat</em> (the night of the 14th of Av) in case there are a few cloudy nights and he ends up missing the opportunity. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.426.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema Orach Chaim 426:2</a>, quoting the Terumat HaDeshen, that in any month one does not wait to say <em>kiddush levanah</em> on <em>motzaei shabbat</em> past the tenth of the month.)</p>\n<p>When <em>tish'ah be-av</em> falls on Thursday, Rema in Darchei Moshe (quoted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.426.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 10</a>) indeed rules that one waits to say <em>kiddush levanah</em> on the following <em>motzaei shabbat</em> (the night of the twelfth of Av), notwithstanding the general rule of not waiting past the tenth quoted in the previous paragraph.</p>\n<p><strong>So <em>kiddush levanah</em> in Av is generally not going to be done on <em>motzaei shabbat</em>. But why do it on <em>motzaei tish'ah be-av</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a great question. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.426.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema Orach Chaim 426:2</a> specifically says not to recite <em>kiddush levanah</em> on <em>motzaei tish'ah be'av</em>, and instead do it on a subsequent night, although not (in general) waiting for <em>motzaei shabbat</em>. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%95#%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush ibid. :4</a> writes such as well. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.426.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 10</a> explains (as you note in your question) that <em>motzaei tish'ah be'av</em> is not a time of joy. (Presumably, Rema would also instruct you to put on nice clothes when you recite <em>kiddush levanah</em> on a weeknight following <em>motzaei tish'ah be-av</em>, as he rules in general regarding reciting <em>kiddush levanah</em> on a weeknight <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.426.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(462:2)</a>.)</p>\n<p>However, as you observe, many people do not follow this ruling of Rema, and do recite <em>kiddush levanah</em> on <em>motzaei tish'ah be'av</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.426.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 11</a> quotes \"the <em>acharonim</em>\" as permitting this practice, but notes the incongruity of reciting <em>kiddush levanah</em> while still fasting and not wearing shoes. He therefore writes that one should eat something and put on one's shoes before reciting <em>kiddush levanah</em> on <em>motzaei tish'ah be'av</em>. (In <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40448&st=&pgnum=184\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'ar HaTziyun 9</a>, he points out that if waiting to eat will cause one to miss reciting <em>kiddush levanah</em> with the community, it is better to recite it with them before eating, due to the principle of <em>berov am hadrat melech</em>.)</p>\n<p><strong>If we rule against the Rema, then <em>kiddush levanah</em> in Av can be done on <em>motzaei tish'ah be-av</em>. Is there a specific reason to do so, rather than waiting until a later night</strong>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ba%27er_Hetev_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.551.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baer Heitev to Orach Chaim 551:8</a> notes the Arizal's directive to specifically recite <em>kiddush levanah</em> on <em>motzaei tisha'ah be-av</em>, as it is the time of Mashiach's birth, which ties in thematically with the rebirth of the moon.</p>\n<p>On a more practical level, we pointed out that one is not supposed to wait past the tenth of the month to recite <em>kiddush levanah</em>, out of concern for cloudy nights. That being the case, once we rule that it is permitted to recite <em>kiddush levanah</em> on <em>motzaei tisha'ah be-av</em> (the tenth of Av), my assumption is that one should specifically do so, to minimize the chances of missing it (as well as the general principle of doing <em>mitzvot</em> as speedily as possible). See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14597&st=&pgnum=118\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kenesset HaGedolah, Orach Chaim 426</a> who invokes the worry about cloudy nights as a reason to not push off reciting <em>kiddush levanah</em> from <em>motzaei tish'ah be-av</em>.</p>\n<p>Further, in many communities, I imagine that <em>arvit</em> on <em>motzaei tish'ah be-av</em> attracts larger crowds than a regular weeknight <em>arvit</em>. Therefore, it makes sense to me for those communities to specifically recite <em>kiddush levanah</em> then, to increase the chances of more members of the community reciting it that month.</p>\n\n\n",

We first request for <em>Avodah</em> in the Temple with addition of <em>Ya'aleh v'Yavo</em> on Rosh Chodesh and Moadim. Afterwards we say thanksgiving <em>Modim</em> with the addition for Chanukah and Purim.</p>\n<p>What is the reason for such a reversed order?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>\"When you have eaten your fill, you shall bless Hashem your God for the good land that He has given you.\" ((Deut.) Devarim 8:10)</strong></p>\n<p>The Talmud (Brachos 48b), explains that this mitzvah of blessing G-d after a meal (based on bread), is made of 4 blessings according to Jewish Law, and evolution. The first three blessings are directly relevant to the OP.</p>\n<p>The first blessing of \"Zan\", was authored by Moshe Rabeinu in his times thanking G-d for the sustenance (as Moshe merited to receive the \"Manna\" from heaven which we ate for forty years).</p>\n<p>The second blessing for \"the Land of Israel\", is attributed to Yehoshua bin Nun. He lead us in conquering Cana'an. By the time this blessing was enacted it marked the fact that Jews could finally fulfill the mitzvah of blessing after a meal for the first time in history as commanded. (The verse commanding blessing conditions the act of blessing on thanks for the Land.)</p>\n<p>So once we miraculously received the land the second blessing is made for thanks and praise. Other things are then listed like Bris Milah, and Torah, and going out of Egyptian bondage. (without which nothing else was possible)</p>\n<p>(The first blessing thanking for the miracle of Manna, would not have been appropriate to use to include references to thanks for the other items as we didn't have a land then; and Sichon and Og's lands didn't count as long as other Jews didn't have their land. Meanwhile since the Land is so significant, it rated its own seperate blessing. Once that happened, it became the blessing to list other items of thanks.)</p>\n<p>So naturally, \"Al HaNissim\" for Channukah and Purim attaches to the second blessing for thanksgiving on the land and other miracles.</p>\n<p>The third blessing is attributed to King David and King Solomon. In their time it was a pettition to build and establish Jerusalem and the Temple (and was so worded).</p>\n<p>Nowadays we say it as a pettition to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.\nTherefore mentioning things which are connected with the missing Temple service are attached to this blessing.</p>\n<p>This includes \"R'tzey\" and \"Yaaleh v'Yavo\" for the Sabbath, Rosh Chodesh, and the Festivals which have Biblically mandated \"Korbanos\" (temple offerings), while Purim and Channukah have no such mandate in the Torah.</p>\n<p>Finally, the fourth blessing was instituted by The Sages of Yavneh during Roman occupation, for thanking G-d that the slain Jews of the city of Beytar miraculously did not decompose and were finally allowed burial by the Romans.</p>\n<p>This thanks deserved its own special Rabbinical blessing which would not have normally been listed in the second blessing of thanks since that blessing focuses on miracles like the land which are Biblical pre-requisites for living people to fully take part in mitzvos. (Bris, Land, freedom, Torah)</p>\n<p>Therefore kindness to the dead was viewed as a special seperate blessing.</p>\n<p>On the  other hand.....</p>\n<p>The Amidah prayer was compiled/formulated/standardized by The Men of the Great Assembly.(except for blessing 19 against heretics authored later in Roman times)</p>\n<p>The blessing for the temple service follows immediately after a series of supplication requests ending in a request to ask G-d to return to Jerusalem and to return the Davidic dynasty. (followed by a general blessing for all possible requests)</p>\n<p>The next blessing declares the return of the Temple Service which is the Biblical basis for pristine and organized prayers in the first place. So this follows in the previous order.</p>\n<p>Since it addresses the Temple service itself, it is now appropriate to attach \"Yaaleh v'Yavo\" for Rosh Chodesh, and the Festivals which have Biblically mandated \"Korbanos\" (temple offerings), while Purim and Channukah (Al HaNissim), have no such mandate in the Torah.</p>\n<p>The next blessing of thanksgiving (even if it might not be a \"request\") now includes thanks for everything from G-d, and for miracles such as those surrounding the holidays of Channukah and Purim; so \"Al HaNissim\" belongs here.</p>\n<p>(Finally we beseech for Peace at the end of the Amidah because the Talmud explains Peace is the proper vessel by which all other blessing can be established properly so it must go at the end.)</p>\n<p>So once you compare the way the blessing after a meal conforms with the verse commanding it and the evolution of Jewish history, and then realize how and why the Amidah prayer was formulated, the apparent contradictions or differences simply disappear.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The OP makes the observation that while the Blessing after Meals has thanks first and mention of the Temple Service second, the Amidah prayer mentions the Temple Service first and thanks second. The OP then demands to know the significance behind this difference.</p>\n<p>The answer is that there is no significance as the two prayers are not comparative at all.</p>\n<p>(If the mere initial observation of such a \"difference in order\" has deeper meaning, then the burden of proof is on the OP to show why.)</p>\n<p>Blessing after the Meal is based on a requirement found in the verse:</p>\n<p>\"When you have eaten your fill, you shall bless Hashem your God for the good land that He has given you.\" ((Deut.) Devarim 8:10)</p>\n<p>The Talmud (Brachos 48b), explains that the choice of order of the prayers in the Blessing after Meals evolved with Jewish history. Its order was therefore forced by history.</p>\n<p>Moshe Rabeinu authored the first paragraph of blessing for sustenance (because he had the Manna). When Yehoshua conquered most of Eretz Yisroel, he authored the next paragraph of blessing for thanksgiving having received the Land of Israel. In fact the Land is central to the Biblical obligation to Bless after a meal. So such \"thanks\" belongs in the Blessing after Meals (and we customarily add other thanks here like Al Hanissim).</p>\n<p>When The Jewish people were further established, G-d spoke to King David and King Solomon commanding the building of the permanent Temple in Jerusalem as mandated by Deut. Devarim 12:13-14 etc.</p>\n<p>They in turn saw fit to add a petition in the Blessing after Meals for every Jew to ask G-d to build and establish Jerusalem and the Temple with its service (avodah).</p>\n<p>Nowadays, we do so as a petition to ask G-d to rebuild and restore Jerusalem and the Temple service (after the destruction). Likewise we customarily add Yaaleh V'yavo here because Biblical holidays require Biblical Korbanos (sacrifices at the Temple).</p>\n<p>Therefore the order of the paragraphs is forced by the chronology of Jewish history as appropriate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Amidah was standardized all at once by the men of the Great Assembly hundreds of years later (See Talmud, Megillah 17b). So the Sages were free to put thanks and avodah however and wherever they liked. But their reasons are beyond the scope of the OP.</p>\n<p>In any case the choice of order of thanks and avodah in the Blessing after Meals and the order in the Amidah have no connection.</p>\n\n\n",

They did not legislate these fasts for sick\npeople. In this sense, Yom Kippur is different than other fasts. On\nYom Kippur, even the sick are obligated to fast because it is of\nbiblical origin, and therefore only if the illness is so serious that\nfasting will be life endangering is he exempt from fasting - for\npreserving life takes precedence over Torah commandments. But when the\nsickness is not dangerous, on Yom Kippur one must fast and on other\nfasts instituted by the sages one is exempt.</p>\n<p>As a rule, one whose suffering and weakness prevent him from going\nabout his life as usual and force him to lie in bed is considered sick\nfrom the point of view of Jewish law. For example, a person who has\nthe flu, angina (choking inflammation), or a high temperature, is\nexempt from fasting.</p>\n<p>While fasting, almost everybody experiences a head-ache and weakness,\nand it is easier for one to lie down in bed than to carry on as usual.\nSometimes the suffering experienced during a fast is greater than that\nfelt by one who is sick with the flu. All the same, these feelings are\nnot considered \"sickness\" in a halakhic sense; they are the natural\nresults of fasting which are bound to disappear a number of hours\nafter the fast. Therefore, one who is sick to the point that he must\nlie in bed as a result of his sickness is exempt from fasting, but one\nwho suffers as a result of the fast itself is not. One who suffers\nfrom fasting to the point where he is no longer merely \"afflicted\" in\nthe normal sense of one who fasts but has entered the realm of one who\nis seriously ill, is exempt from fasting.</p>\n<p>A weak or very old person who knows that he will be discomforted by\nthe fast and fears that the fast will cause him to lose his strength\nand become sick is exempt from fasting. The same goes for a person who\nrecovered from sickness and fears that fasting will cause his sickness\nto return (<em>Kaf HaChaim</em> 550:6; 554:31).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Any person who knows that if he fasts he is bound to become sick is\nexempt from fasting. For example, a person who suffers from an active\nulcer or severe migraine is exempt because the fast will quite likely\nawaken the malady.</strong></em> ...</p>\n<p>...Any time a question arises, one must ask a\nRabbi or a Torah-observant doctor.</p>\n<p>Torah authorities teach that one who is permitted to eat on a fast day\nshould at any rate refrain from partaking in delicacies and eat only\nthat which is necessary. Such a person, however, is permitted to eat a\nfull meal and drink as much as he desires, and there is no need for\nhim to eat small portions at set intervals as is the rule on Yom\nKippur. Only on Yom Kippur, because it is biblically mandated and even\nthe sick are obligated in its fulfillment, must one who is permitted\nto eat consume small portions of food at intervals in order to\n(technically) avoid breaking the fast. On rabbinically-ordained fasts,\nthe ill are not obligated to fast, and therefore there is no need for\nthem to eat in the manner indicated.</p>\n<p>It is also important to point out that one who is chronically ill or\nmust take medicine on a regular basis, viz., one who is on\nantibiotics, must continue taking medicine on fast days. If possible,\nsuch a person should take the medicine without drinking water. One who\nneeds to drink water in order to swallow the medicine should mix\nsomething with the water in order to cause it to become bitter, thus\nmaking the water \"unfit for drinking.\" This is the kind of water that\nshould be used when taking medicine on a fast day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thus <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.4.9-4.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:9-10</a> (giving of the Torah at Sinai) is a mandate to pass on that memory to one's descendants (והודעתם לבניך ולבני בניך) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Hasagot_HaRamban_on_Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments_Omitted_by_Rambam.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shikhchat HaLavin 2</a>).</p>\n<p>Even more strikingly, for Ramban to add <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.24.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 24:9</a> (Miriam) and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.9.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 9:7</a> (the sins in the desert) to the list, he needs to rely on a <em>midrash</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifra%2C_Bechukotai%2C_Section_1.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifra Bechukotai 26:3</a>) which mandates that one speaks about these matters (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Hasagot_HaRamban_on_Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments_Omitted_by_Rambam.7.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shikhchat Ha-Asin 7</a>).</p>\n<p>Given that we have no source in Chazal which understands <em>zechor yemot olam</em> as requiring us to say something, we can understand that for Rambam and Ramban it doesn't merit inclusion in the count of the 613 <em>mitzvot</em>.</p>\n<p>(Why don't Chazal understand <em>zekhor yemot olam</em> to mandate speaking? If you look at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifra%2C_Bechukotai%2C_Section_1.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">above-referenced <em>midrash</em></a>, you'll see that they only do so if they can find another verse requiring merely remembering that subject, thus making the \"<em>zakhor</em>\" verses redundant, unless we understand them to be requiring speech in addition to memory. <em>Zekhor yemot olam</em> has no such second verse available, thus it is presumably referring to memory alone, and not to speech.)</p>\n\n\n",

In order to understand it, my answer will start with the second, and at the end I will add some useful and I believe connected ideas:</p>\n<p>The second commentary given by the Kli Yakar implies that there was some sort of reason that it was Moshe's ruling and decision (with agreement according to Hashem's will) that the young males should be executed*. This answer is just a glimpse into Hashem's vast thoughts and plan, and not an exploration of the <em>halachot</em> of war in depth. We cannot know the deep and far reaching reasons why Hashem would will this grave thing, but we are also not immature that we would dare to therefore conclude that it must mean that Hashem or even Moshe are less righteous than us, or wrong, <em>chas veshalom</em>.</p>\n<p>Theodicy is not the question, even though it is a good question and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/theodicy\">dealt with at length on this site</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The first answer he gives implies, Moshe didn't initially command the Jews to fulfil this**, i.e. slay the young males, he just commanded it for the women. When the Jews didn't kill all the women, Moshe got angry at them, and then commanded them to slay the male children, and the rest of the females (above a certain age).</p>\n<p>You ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why now include the young males?</li>\n<li>Why <em>all</em> the females, even the one's who didn't sin?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implied by your second question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why did Moshe get angry?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Kli Yakar answers all these questions.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Answer</h4>\n<p>The Kli Yakar informs us that he was doing this in order to <strong>alleviate them from suspicion</strong>: the suspicion that the reason they didn't kill all the females was because they had <em>perhaps</em> spared the one's they sinned with... or <em>perhaps</em> wanted to marry them, which would explain why they were not to spare any, and why Moshe was angry.</p>\n<p>So, <strong>he saved them from that suspicion</strong> by instead making it look like they were merely coming back to inquire about what to do with the women and children - which they are indeed supposed to do - so then he told them to proceed with slaying the young males, as well as all the females above a certain age (i.e. the age of being able to sin with the Jews). If not; if he had just reiterated the command to kill all the females, it could have looked like they ignored him the first time, because of their <em>yeitzer hara</em> and lack of <em>teshuva</em>, <em>chas veshalom</em>, and it would never be possible for them to clear their names from that suspicion.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To understand this, I suggest we need to know two extra details:</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Moshe was the role model leader of the Jewish people</h5>\n<p>Much of the commentary on Moshe given throughout Tanach emphasises how good a leader he was in every way. One of the most important traits - a trait in every real leader of the Jewish people - was that he would do the job of ensuring the relationship between the Jewish people and Hashem, by represending and defending them. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_-0e4GF_mY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He would do so to <em>mesirat nefesh</em></a>, and this devotion is also a theme in what's happening in this situation: caring about even alleviating the suspicions of the Jewish people looking bad, in all circumstances.</p>\n<p>Still, why is Israel \"looking bad\" so important?</p>\n<h5>The Satan accuses us and that's how Hashem's mercy can turn to judgement</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bamidbar.14.17.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshe was taught how to appeal to Hashem when he went up the mountain</a>. Moshe was taught to understand how to pray to Hashem properly for the Jewish people, and for this He had to learn how one has a relationship with Hashem. Hashem taught him that He loves us as children and therefore doesn't see wrong in us, to the point of being very lenient and forgiving with us as default. However, when we do certain things, the \"satan\" has the ability to make an argument to Hashem's gevura, His judgement, and this can withhold Hashem's feelings of mercy towards us and produce moral indignation and anger towards us, <em>lo aleinu</em>, and harsher decrees, <em>chas veshalom</em>.</p>\n<p>As we said, the default is mercy, and He is very merciful with our sins, and doesn't allow the satan to even speak. However, Hashem informs us that the satan is permitted to speak under certain circumstances. For example, it is brought in the Chafetz Chaim that when we speak Lashon Hara about each other, the satan, <em>midda knegged midda</em>, can speak negatively about us, bringing up all our other sins, which Hashem otherwise treats very mercifully, in the Heavenly Court directly appealing to Hashem's gevura, <em>chas veshalom</em>. Even worse is lack of <em>ahava</em>, and even <em>sina</em>, <em>chas veshalom</em> (see Derech Mitzvotecha on these mitzvot for the grave consequences of this in Hashem's relationship with us).</p>\n<p>In this case too***, and this is the <strong>tl;dr</strong>, Moshe was very much concerned about not allowing the satan to accuse us of not having done <em>teshuva</em> for the terrible sins with the Midianite women. Even the suspicion of that, itself, was a huge problem for Benei Yisrael and their relationship with Hashem. So he acted as a devoted leader and defended the people as Hashem taught him how, on the mountain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* He quotes the Gemara in Berachot 40a's terminology, implying that this is a halachic ruling by Moshe, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136448/31534\">which is what Hashem appointed him to do, trusting he would do so according to Hashem's will to the best of his ability</a>.<br />\n** Perhaps a recurrent theme: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/91667/31534\">Jews failing to completely fulfil commandments pertaining to wiping out their enemies</a>.<br />\n*** Why do I think this? The Kli Yakar explains that the reason Moshe only said \"immediately\" by the young males is connected to the gemara (see first *) where Rava bar Shmuel rules לית דין צריך בשש - this is a matter that does not require waiting. This case in particular, and the language of this ruling, imply (as Tosfot there is explained by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yedei_Moshe_on_Devarim_Rabbah.2.10.2?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah,_Vilna,_1878&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yedei Moshe on Devarim Rabbah 2:10:2</a>) the concept of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/142481/the-shelah-on-doing-teshuvah-when-eating/142487#142487\">the Satan accusing us at mealtime</a>: שלא יהיה שטן מקטרג בסעודתו - i.e. we should bring salt to the table, and wash without hefsek, to be guaranted the satan doesn't accuse us</sup></p>\n\n\n",

I also heard someone say that the Torah holds that the Heliocentric view is true although independent of the Geocentric view, and they said that this is from the Zohar. Also, I heard — correct me if I'm wrong — that the Rebbe said that both can be reconciled through the theory of relativity and that he also held that the Sun revolves around the Earth.</p>\n<p>So which is it really though? Is there a source in the Torah that explains this debate? Does the Torah hold that both are true also and explains the theory of relativity even before Einstein in order to reconcile the two views even before?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is not really a Torah question. But if you want here's the answer. Yes the systems can be reconciled using math. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Heliocentric system</a> the motion of planets is described by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kepler's laws</a>, which are simple and offer reasonably close approximations. Only with development of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity scientists discovered deviations from Kepler's laws which helped correct the forecast of the motion of planet Mercury, for example.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Geocentric system</a> one cannot write such elegant equations like Kepler's laws. However, if one were to use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fourier series</a>, one could describe motion of planets with some good accuracy based on past observations. That was the nature of the approximations of ancient Greeks (Claudius Ptolemaeus) and later Medieval astronomers, who first said that each planet moves in a circle around the Earth. Then, when they saw deviations they corrected by saying that the planet actually moves in a small circle whose center is moving in a big circle around the Earth. Then they had to introduce new and new smaller circles as the astronomers were able to get better and better measurements. Such a calculation is the same as representation of a signal by frequencies.</p>\n<p>As far as Torah goes, one can guess that Earth is not stationary in the center of Universe, due to etymology word ארץ containing רץ - run. i.e. it's something running. Alternatively, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.5.8?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 5:8</a> teachers \"Why was it called <em>eretz</em>? It is because it hastened [ratzeta] to perform the will of its Maker\". I.e. it followed instructions to either expand or stop expanding (depending on the commentary). However, one-time hastening is not a justification for its name. Perhaps, it's constantly hastening, running, as if in a free fall (around the Sun).</p>\n<p>Certainly, it is impossible to state what the Jewish beliefs were regarding astronomy in ancient times, because the scripture is using a very simple language and historians tend to use it as a proof of simplistic beliefs. However, some facts about ancient world, such as worship of the Sun gods, development of Babylonian and Hebrew calendars, or alignment of pyramids with stars, could be reinterpreted as some bits of knowledge lost due to wars, catastrophes, destructive practices, or history falsification (eg. Greeks after the time of Alexander, Egyptians making their history very long), etc.</p>\n<p>To see that the Sun does not rotate around the Earth, one could notice by crossing the equator: in the Northern hemisphere the Sun circles clock-wise East - South - West; in the Southern Hemisphere - it circles counter clock-wise East - North - West. Why change of direction? Ancients knew that the Earth is round because of how the stars change their angles observed at different distant points (Athens vs. Alexandria in Egypt). Also phases of the moon switch: in the northern hemisphere in the beginning of the month - 🌒, and 🌘 - in the end of the month; in the southern hemisphere - it's reversed. However, Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 2.6</a> gives a correct formulation regardless of the hemisphere.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>So much to unpack in this question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Torah and the whole Tana\"kh don't deal with cosmology.

Also, \"the Torah\" doesn't \"hold\" anything, it is all up to the Rabbinic ever-changing understanding.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There's no evidence of Heliocentric thought in pre-modern Jewish tradition.

In Hilchos Kiddush Hachodesh Rambam clearly states: \"we don't possess the ancient [Hebrew] knowledge but use that of the Chaldeans and the Babylonians\".<br />\nTherefore, any scientific claim found in Jewish should be assumed as coming from contemporary <em>non-Jewish authors</em> (a phenomenon known as \"one must believe in Gentiles' wisdom\"). For example, the Pharisaic/Jewish calendar was adopted from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Babylonian lunisolar calendar and the Metonic cycle</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As a rule, Rabbinic Judaism focuses on the <strong>experiential/Halachic implications of Earthly phenomena rather than their essence</strong>. I.e. the physical nature of the Sun and the Moon or the cosmological system are irrelevant to all time-related Halochos.<br />\nHowever, if you can show, that different cosmological systems lead to different Halachic conclusions, only then it would become a Halachic question.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The Torah definitely does not hold the Heliocentric view and the Torah (and Zohar) definitely did not know anything at all about relativity before Einstein. In fact, Rabbi Slifkin writes that Orthodox Jews were the last group of people in Europe to adopt the Heliocentric view.</p>\n<p>Think about this. If the Torah held the Heliocentric view, why does Joshua 10 say that the sun, and not the earth, stopped in its course? Spinoza mocked Joshua, or the author of his book, for his ignorance in thinking that the sun circled the earth. The earth would stand still, not the sun. Joshua was a soldier, not an astronomer. The tale shows the ignorance of Joshua, for he should have commanded the earth to have stood still. The story of the sun’s standing still upon a hill is unscientific. The sun did not stand still for Joshua and his soldiers.</p>\n<p>Thus, in all likelihood, the Torah held the Geocentric view. Yes, the Rebbe believed that the sun revolves around the earth. This view is likewise unscientific. Besides, if the Torah knew about the Heliocentric system, the Torah would have mentioned it.</p>\n\n\n",

The word Torah, in terms of its numerical value [gimatriyya], is 611, the number of mitzvot that were received and taught by Moses our teacher. In addition, there are two mitzvot: “I am the Lord your God” and: “You shall have no other gods” (Exodus 20:2, 3), the first two of the Ten Commandments, that we heard from the mouth of the Almighty, for a total of 613.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.5.16.3?ven=The_Sefaria_Midrash_Rabbah,_2022&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir haShirim Rabbah 5:16</a>, the commandments were said one by one as a prophetic experience, about which we can learn in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yimiyahu 23:29</a> and discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/144367/36610\">here</a>.

It is interpreted homiletically: From each and every utterance that emerged from His cheeks, i.e., the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, the entire world was filled with fragrant spices. And since the world was already filled by the first utterance, where was there room for the spices of the second utterance to go? The Holy One, Blessed be He, brought forth wind from His treasuries and made the spices pass one at a time, leaving room for the consequences of the next utterance. As it is stated: “His lips are lilies [shoshanim] dripping with flowing myrrh.” Each and every utterance resulted in flowing myrrh.

    "content": "# Does Judaism acknowledge and accept the principle of absolute, personal bodily autonomy as a foundation behind a right to abortion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Currently, in the United States, there is a <em>very heated</em> and <em>emotional debate</em> going on over the subject of <strong>the right of a woman to an abortion</strong> and the principle of <em>abortion on demand</em>.</p>\n<p>This is a very personal subject for at least 50% of the general population, and because Jewish women, <em>to their credit</em>, are very active in the community at large trying to shape, define, understand and influence this issue, it is also a timely and highly relevant subject for Jewish women in particular. In particular, the <em>more non-traditional Jewish community</em> is very active <em>in support of</em> and <em>advocating</em> for <em><strong>a woman's right to abortion</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><em>The primary argument</em> being offered as justification for this is that <em>a woman has a right to custody and control of her own body</em>, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_body,_my_choice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">My body, my choice</a>.</p>\n<p>In legal terms, this is <em><strong>the principle of personal, bodily autonomy</strong></em>. That each individual owns their personal body completely and has full discretion to act upon it and to do with it as they choose.</p>\n<p>At first glance, affirmation of this principle hints at the subject of free choice (בחירה חפשית). Taken to the extreme, it leads to permission for <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">self-harm</a> and even euthanasia, <em><strong><a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/does-the-constitution-protect-a-right-to-die\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Right to Die</a></strong></em>. It also presumes that <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/articles/unpacking-my-body-my-choice/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a developing fetus is only an extension of the woman, like any other bodily limb</a>, or even less, possibly an invasive and unwelcome parasite feeding off the life of its unwilling host.</p>\n<p>Does Torah and traditional Jewish law recognize this principle, that each individual possesses complete, personal, bodily autonomy?</p>\n<p>Please provide sources where possible to clearly reflect any statements made.</p>\n<p>Thanks to any who contribute accessible answers to this profound question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>Rav <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Lichtenstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aharon Lichtenstein</a> addresses this issue directly in his article \"<a href=\"https://etzion.org.il/en/philosophy/great-thinkers/harav-aharon-lichtenstein/cultivate-and-guard-universal-duties-mankind\" rel=\"noreferrer\">To Cultivate and to Guard: The Universal Duties of Mankind</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>OWNERSHIP OF ONESELF</strong></p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier the prevalent secular conception of one’s “ownership” of himself. One hears this argument in various contexts, especially with regard to the question of abortion: it’s a woman’s right, it’s her own body, she can do what she wants, etc. Years back, I was asked to testify before a subcommittee of the Knesset which dealt with abortions. Among other things, I mentioned that, leaving aside the significant question of whether it is the woman’s body only or whether the fetus has some rights as well, there is a more fundamental problem. Even if we were to accept that indeed it is the woman’s own body, we totally reject the conception that she then can do with it as she pleases. This is a completely anti-halakhic perception. It rests on a secular assumption that, as it were, “My Nile is my own; I made it for myself” (Yechezkel 29:3), as if we are the source of our own existence and therefore the masters of our own being. This is assuredly not the case. In absolute terms, a person does not own himself.</p>\n<p>In fact, there are prohibitions that apply to how a person relates to himself. Just as one is forbidden to injure or curse others, so is he forbidden to injure himself or to curse himself. Similarly, the mitzva of “<em>Ve-nishmartem me’od le-nafshoteikhem,</em> Take utmost care of yourselves” (Devarim 4:15) specifically prohibits a person from taking unnecessary risks, even though he will not affect anybody else. The very notion that a person should be free to do what he wants with relation to himself is at absolute odds with our conception. We believe that you are never an independent entity, nor do you “own” yourself; you are always a <em>shomer</em> appointed by God. That applies to your “property,” to your own self, and certainly to your relationship to what surrounds you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(You can read said Knesset testimony <a href=\"https://traditiononline.org/abortion-a-halakhic-perspective/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Absolutely not. As @RabbiKaii says, there is almost no principle of bodily autonomy in Judaism. Tattoos are forbidden. Even shaving with a razor is prohibited for men. So is removing the <em>payos</em>. Men are commanded to be circumcised. And according to all opinions, abortion at will is forbidden.</p>\n<p>The reason is that one's body, as with the entirety of creation, belongs to Hashem. Hashem sets the rules. Bechira has no relation to this. Bechira means people can choose whether or not to obey Hashem, and therefore will be rewarded or punished accordingly. That is all.

One's body, however, doesn't belong to a person, and therefore has no autonomy on what happens to one's body.

    "content": "# How does the Talmud account for Moshe being instructed to make the luchos before the wooden aron but reversing them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud understands that Moshe was instructed regarding the Mishkan prior to the Aron etc but for some reason (Ritva theorizes that it was a test) flipped them when instructing Bezalel with Bezalel divining that Moshe had reversed God's instructions thus leading to his name</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gemara Berakhot 55a:12\nRabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: Bezalel was called by that name on account of his wisdom. When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Go say to Bezalel, “Make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels” (see Exodus 31:7–11), Moses went and reversed the order and told Bezalel: “Make an ark, and vessels, and a tabernacle” (see Exodus 25–26). He said to Moses: Moses, our teacher, the standard practice throughout the world is that a person builds a house and only afterward places the vessels in the house, and you say to me: Make an ark, and vessels, and a tabernacle. If I do so in the order you have commanded, the vessels that I make, where shall I put them? Perhaps God told you the following: “Make a tabernacle, ark, and vessels” (see Exodus 36). Moses said to Bezalel: Perhaps you were in God’s shadow [betzel El], and you knew precisely what He said. You intuited God’s commands just as He stated them, as if you were there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud apparently does not accept that Moshe or Bezalel would contravene the divine ordering thus necessitating this elaborate drama</p>\n<p>How does this conception account for the fact that Moshe was commanded regarding the construction of the luchos before the wooden ark but flipped them?</p>\n<p>Devarim 10:1-5</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At that time the Lord said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark. I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.” So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the Lord commanded me, and they are there now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the army, these young men and women have to undergo\nintense training and abide by strict codes of discipline. India\nprovides a mellow antithesis to such a regimen, and beckons to\ntravelers in many ways. Liora and her brother Ayal were two such\ntourists who took off for India. They traveled together from one\ntourist attraction to the next, then split up to follow separate\ntrails. Ayal stumbled upon Arachim’s Bayit HaYehudi hostel in India\nwhere he enjoyed the hospitality and listened to some fascinating\nlectures. Drawn to the extensive library, he discovered new concepts\nthat changed his life completely. He eventually opted for a life of\nTorah and mitzvos.</p>\n<p>In contrast to Ayal, Liora wandered around India until she reached the\ncity of Varanasi where she came across a cult headed by a charismatic\nguru. He spoke eloquently of the brotherhood of all mankind, the\nspirit of the cosmos, and efficient exploitation of the earth’s\nresources. His captivating words entranced Liora, and she immediately\njoined the cult.</p>\n<p>When Ayal learned of his sister’s new affiliation, he tried to\nextricate her from the cult, but her attraction to her new mentors was\ntoo strong. He begged and pleaded to no avail. As a last resort, Ayal\nsuggested that they both return home for a visit with their parents.\nHe suggested that Liora attend an Arachim lecture together with him\nwhile they were in Israel. Liora readily agreed, fully confident that\nnothing could sever her from her new source of inspiration.</p>\n<p>After a considerable delay, an Arachim staffer mounted the podium and\nannounced that the lecturer was sick and unable to attend. However, in\norder not to leave the audience entirely empty-handed, he read to them\na short summary of the Jewish law concerning lost property. He\nexplained that the Torah requires someone who finds a lost object to\nassume responsibility for it and to make a reasonable effort to locate\nthe owner. He also described how a finder must ascertain that the\nclaimant is truly the owner by asking for identifying marks or\ncharacteristics, to prove that the item really belongs to him.</p>\n<p>Liora sat there and yawned, totally unimpressed. The lecture had\npractically put her to sleep. Ayal was devastated. How would he ever\npry his sister away from the cult now? After the lecture, they trudged\nout of the hall and headed for home.</p>\n<p>The next day, Liora flew back to her cult in India, and Ayal enrolled\nin a yeshivah for baalei t’shuvah in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>It was only a short while later that Ayal was suddenly called out of\nthe beis midrash with an urgent message that someone was outside\nwaiting to see him. He was speechless to find his sister Liora\ngreeting him with a wide smile.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing here?” he asked incredulously. “I want to enroll\nin a school for baalos t’shuvah,” she replied.</p>\n<p>“You?” asked Ayal. “What happened? What made you change your mind\nabout your ‘wonderful’ cult and its guru?”</p>\n<p>Liora told him the full story: “One day, soon after I returned to\nIndia, the guru asked me to accompany him somewhere. As we were\nwalking along the alleyways of Varanasi, the guru bent down and picked\nup a fat wallet that someone had obviously just dropped. He opened it\nand found it full of bills and documents. With a smile of\nsatisfaction, he tucked it into his pocket.</p>\n<p>“I was speechless. Some tourist had just lost a considerable sum of\nmoney, a driver license, and other valuable documents. His name,\naddress, and other personal details were all there, and it would be a\nsimple matter to find him by contacting the police or local embassy of\nhis country. Why did the guru just take it for himself? Wasn’t that\nlike stealing?</p>\n<p>“When I suggested to the guru that perhaps we should try to find the\nowner, he embarked on a long lecture about the unity of the universe,\nthe brotherhood of all men and the dynamics by which the energy of the\ncosmos had transferred resources from the former owner of the wallet\nto him. He explained that the two of them were actually one soul,\ndivided between two bodies, and the wallet had been lost so that the\nmoney would reach its rightful destination.</p>\n<p>“I then recalled the Arachim speaker and his presentation of the Torah\nlaws that apply in such a case. The sharp contrast between philosophy\nperverted by greed and loyalty to the truth brought me back to my\nsenses. I immediately made up my mind to choose the Torah way of life\nand booked a ticket back home.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This goes both to Iyov and to his friends. When faced with suffering, emotion takes a hold of a person and s/he may fail to find or to accept correct answers and turn to accusations. Specifically, the mistake of Iyov and his three friends was to construct G-d in human image, and due to limitations of language thinking that G-d could be understood.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We learn that Iyov, despite being righteous, served out of fear of punishment, not love of G-d. His punishment was given to futher develop his relationship with G-d. Elihu, the 4th and Jewish friend actually raises these points which are the main lesson of the book.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We learn greatness of Abraham. More qualities are listed for Iyov than for Abraham because Iyov was a composite man. Yet Iyov was a man of <em>Olam haZe</em> and that is why Satan requests a test of Iyov. Abraham was a man of Olam haBa - the future. He served G-d out of love. The attitude and perspective of Abraham is brought in the words of Elihu.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We learn how our sages (Rashi vs. Ramban) explain why even righteous may suffer. According to Rashi: rewarding the righteous may also unfairly reward the bad people who live with them and that is why G-d reserves the reward for Olam haBa. According to Ramban, there could be a problem with past incarnations of the person (I do not know kabbala and would not try to understand the point beyond the fact that we are in this world which has a certain history and we cannot change that).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

And he further explained there (in the next halacha): \"How so? For example, if a non-Jew made a mistake in his calculations, the Jew must tell him 'see that I am reliant on your calculations'...\" (The Rambam goes on to say that the Jew should say that he doesn't know what the correct amount is and is reliant on the non-Jew's math, at this point if the non-Jew made a mistake the Jew can benefit). And Harav Hamagid (the Magid Mishna) wrote there \"the Rambam paskened like Rav Kahana there (in Perek Hagozel U'Ma'achil), who acted in this way.\" And look back to the beginning of siman 266: \"if one returns a lost objects to a non-Jew to sanctify God's name so that Jews will be praised and will be known for being trustworthy, this is praiseworthy...\" And the same is true in regards to returning a mistake that the non-Jew himself made. And I write this for future generations, as I have seen many who have become great and wealthy from causing a non-Jew to make a mistake, and they were not succesful and they lost all their wealth, and they didn't leave a blessing behind (for their heirs when they died).

What is his argument?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>I don't speak French, but I can help you clarify Rashi's opinion.</p>\n<p>The status of a child born from a gentile father and Jewish mother is a disagreement among the <em>tanaim</em> and <em>amoraim</em> in <em>gemara</em> (Yevamos 45). Some opinions hold the child is a <em>mamzer</em>, others hold the child is <em>kasher</em>. Within the position of <em>kasher</em>, there is a further discussion whether the child is <em>pagum</em>.</p>\n<p>While most Rishonim assume that <em>kasher</em> implies the child is a regular Jew [albeit with the potential <em>pgam</em>], there is a group of Rishonim who explain <em>kasher</em> as opposed to <em>mamzer</em>, but in reality the child is a gentile. According to these Rishonim, <em>kasher</em> refers to the status post conversion.</p>\n<p>The most explicit mention of this view is Tosfos Kiddushin 75b, who writes the following (see in context for more clarity):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושמא יש לומר אם הולד כשר א\"כ הוא <strong>הולך אחר העובד כוכבים</strong> כדאמר בס\"פ\nדלעיל (דף סז:) וליכא למיחש לכך אם תנשא לעובד כוכבים אבל השתא דקסבר\nהולד ממזר א\"כ הולך אחר אמו ואיכא למיחש טפי שלא תנשא לעובד כוכבים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28944/who-wrote-the-piskei-tosfos\">Piskei Tosfos</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Piskei_Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.142.1?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 142</a>) rules so simply:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם עובד כוכבים הבא על בת ישראל הולד כשר, הוי עובד כוכבים</p>\n<p>If the offspring of a gentile and Jewess is <em>kasher</em>, he is a gentile</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi to Kiddushin (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%97_%D7%91#:%7E:text=%D7%93%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%90%20%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9F%20%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%A9%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%A8%20%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%91%D7%93%20%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%90%20%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%91%D7%93%20%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90%20%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9D%20%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A8%20%D7%99%D7%94%D7%90%20%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%90%20%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%94%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%A8%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%A9%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%94%20%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9C%20%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%A8%20%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">68b</a>) seems to imply [at least according to one position in the gemara] that the opinion who holds <em>kasher</em> believes the child is a gentile. The gemara states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נימא קסבר רבינא עובד כוכבים ועבד הבא על בת ישראל הולד ממזר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi expounds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאתא לאשמועינן דלא שדינן ליה בתר עובד כוכבים דנימא עובד כוכבים הוא ואם\nנתגייר יהא מותר לבא בקהל אלא בתר ישראלית שדינן ליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi describes the opinion that the child is a <em>mamzer</em> as coming against the other option, which is to give the child the status of his gentile father, and explains <em>kasher</em> as referring to post conversion. [See glosses of R Akiva Eiger who refers this Rashi to Tosfos Kiddushin mentioned above]</p>\n<p>This is also the implication of Rashi al haTorah (end of Emor), in the story of the Son of the Egyptian who blasphemed, who the verse describes as:\n'בֶּן אִשָּׁה יִשְׂרְאֵלִית וְהוּא בֶּן אִישׁ מִצְרִי'. The verse explicitly describes him as the son of gentile father and Jewish mother, yet Rashi explains 'בתוך בני ישראל' as refering to post conversion.

Either because 'באומות הולך אחר אביו' - the law with gentiles is that the child's <em>yichus</em> is defined by the father (Kiddushin 67b); or because 'הולד הולך אחר פגום' - when faced with a 'blemished' status, the 'blemish' is transmitted from either parent.</p>\n<p>However, there are many indications in the <em>gemara</em> that the child of a gentile father and Jewish mother is a full fledged Jew [beyond the scope of this answer], besides for numerous contradictions in Rashi's position (see Kiddushin 77a and 70b).

Do any commentaries give a non-literal interpretation to this piece of aggadata?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I did not see such nonliteral commentary. It appears that the mishna is formulated in a way which is psychologically attuned to women to provide a message similar to the one we have in the beginning of Sh'ma. It is not abstract, but specific and focuses on mitzvos which express similar ideas. I.e. it yields inductive reasoning (<em>prat uklal</em>) rather than deductive (<em>klal uprat</em>).</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The prohibition of niddah is similar to loving G-d בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ֥, with one's heart, i.e. one's body. That is to leave personal physical comfort for a higher chance to create life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The mitzvah of challah is similar to loving G-d בְּכָל־מְאֹדֶֽךָ with physical resources. I.e. also giving property for holy purpose.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, Shabbos candles is similar to loving G-d בְּכָל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ with entire soul, i.e. spiritual purpose.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these 3 mitzvos, when violated may lead to kares or punishments leading to death, which may have influenced the ending of the mishna. It was formulated, when maternal mortality rates were high.</p>\n<p>I think even switching of the order is important in carrying the message for a woman, vs. what men read in Sh'ma: בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכָל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ וּבְכָל־מְאֹדֶֽךָ, which is inline with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sotah.3.4?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sota 3:4</a>, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words the word \"sojuorner\" means a convert, and the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 24:22</a> states that the law is the same for a convert and for a born Jew.</p>\n<p>There is an argument between <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban and chachmei Tzarfas (Chizkuni) on Vayikra 24:10</a> about when the giyur of the son of Israelite woman took place, prior to Sinai or after Sinai, as well as other conversion implications as discussed in Ramban and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/144485/rashis-opinion-on-the-child-of-a-gentile-father\">here</a> (Thanks Nahum). The French Rabbis (<em>chachmei Tzarfas</em>) stated that prior to Sinai, being Jewish required having a Jewish father and not necessarily a Jewish mother. In other words, son of the Israelite woman lived as an Egyptian, he was not circumcised (1), and he had to convert after Sinai, even though he had a Jewish mother and the law regarding inheriting Jewishness shifted from father to mother.</p>\n<p>Ramban says that prior to Sinai both parents needed to be Jewish, but since the boy followed his mother he converted in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Ramban explains, that the desert travels required that the Jewish people organize under <em>degalim</em> (banners) in camps based on the lineage from their father. (2) The group of converts followed the Jewish camps but they did not enter the camps. The son of Israelite woman did not want to follow the rules that everyone else did.</p>\n<p>There were additional differences between the converts and the sons, who had a Jewish father regarding inheritance of the land in <em>Eretz Israel</em> but they were not relevant to the problem that arose between the son of Shlomis bas Divri and the people from shevet Dan.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) There is a comment from Vilna Gaon regarding the plague of lice of why it did not impress pharaoh. According to him, the son of the Israelite woman has lice, although he lived among the Jews. Other Jewish people did not have lice. Nevertheless, because this man had it, pharaoh hardened his heart.</p>\n<p>(2) In fact, one of the reasons why inheriting Jewishness shifted from father to mother was because Jewish women in Egypt sacrificed themselved to bring children of the 12 <em>Sh'vatim</em>, when they could have children with men of other nations.</p>\n\n\n",

As for the miracles, HaShem is testing our faith, see there.</p>\n<p>That being said, does Judaism care if the Christian miracles occurred or is it agnostic to them as JC was no more than a navi sheker (ditto for other religions and their miracle claims)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>I don't think Judaism cares. Let's give Joshua son of Joseph (aka Jesus) the benefit of the doubt and say he did perform miracles of healing and even raising of the dead. Okay great, so he's a prophet. We've got dozens of those, men and women, Israelite and Gentile who have performed miracles of healing or raising the dead. The Messiah is supposed to at some point usher in a time of great peace, where nations will beat their swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks  (Isaiah 2:2-4). Until that happens it doesn't matter how many miracles a single prophet performs. They could have a regular act at <a href=\"https://www.magiccastle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Magic Castle</a> with a hundred miracles a night, doesn't make them the Messiah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Whether or not Jesus performed miracles has no bearing on whether Jesus qualified as messiah. The reasons Jesus is rejected are straightforward and I can break them down for you.</p>\n<p>To start. The Torah has a long list of honored figures and even enemies who performed miracles. Miracles are not unique to messiah.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moses and all the miracles he performed</li>\n<li>Pharoah's sorcerers being able to mirror miracles performed by Moses</li>\n<li>Elijah raising a widow's son from the dead or raining fire from the sky</li>\n<li>Joshua freezing the sun and moon in the sky</li>\n<li>And many others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These people are obviously not Mashiach. Some of them were directly in contrast to the goals of God and the mission of the Jewish people. (referring to Pharaoh's sorcerers)</p>\n<p>Miracles in and of themselves do not indicate a person is mashiach.</p>\n<p><strong>This leads me to the explanation for why Judaism rejects the claim of Jesus being the Messiah.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>The mashiach is not to be worshipped as God.</strong> The new testament makes many claims about Jesus and his nature. One of these claims is that he is the embodiment of God in flesh (which is a violation of Jewish belief about God's nature) - The Torah states outright that God is not a man <strong>(Numbers 23:19)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The rejection of human sacrifice is at the core of what separates Hashem from the various idols of that time period.</strong> Jesus is claimed to be a sacrifice which forgives the sins of all of mankind. Besides the fact human sacrifices cannot forgive sin (and are in themselves a sin), the Torah is clear that no man cannot die for the sins of another man. <strong>(Deuteronomy 24:16)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Jesus endorsed ritual cannibalism as a form of worship.</strong> He told his followers that they should treat bread as his body and wine as his blood. I shouldn't have to explain to you why that's a problem from the Jewish perspective. Jews can't even eat the blood of an animal. The shechita slaughter process is done in part to remove as much blood as humanly possible. The idea that God would create a new form of practice which includes violating his original covenant doesn't work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mashiach is to be from the line of King David. Specifically, he is a male descendent passed down through a male line.</strong> The core issue with the entire Jesus narrative is that Jesus has no earthly father. While Christians hold this as evidence for his divinity, it's actually the biggest issue against Jesus. If he has no father, he has no direct line back to King David. His mother could not pass that title to him as women do not grant that status and Joseph (his adoptive father) his not his blood. You can't be adopted into the Davidic line.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Similarly to the previous point, the Mashiach is said to come from the tribe of Judah.</strong> The problem Jesus has is tribal affiliation is passed from father to son in the Jewish faith. Where a mother grants a child their status as a Jew, the father grants the child their tribal affiliation. Jesus has no tribe. The fact he is claimed a virgin birth means he has no father to grant him tribal affiliation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The Mashiach is described as a god-fearing Jew who will honor the laws that we have been given.</strong> Jesus didn't just violate various Jewish laws, he did so on purpose in order to make a point about the morals of the Jewish leadership at the time. He did not honor the laws as though he was fearful of disappointing God, he purposely violated them and then lectured back at the people who called him out on it. That character trait violates a core value of Mashiach.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The Mashiach will ingather the Jewish people back to Israel.</strong> Not only did Jesus not bring the Jews back to Israel, the Jews were exiled 70 years after Jesus lived. This is the opposite of what should have happened.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The Mashiach will reign at a time of global peace.</strong> Not only did Jesus not usher in world peace, wars have been fought in his name for thousands of years. The colonial expansion of Christianity and even the infighting between Catholics and Protestants in their civil war are examples of that lack of peace.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The Mashiach will reign at a time when the knowledge of God is universal.</strong> Think about this from a historical perspective. Christianity and the Jewish exile are both equal parts of how the knowledge of God spread throughout the world. Even if Christianity makes claims we reject, their version of the Hebrew bible tells our stories in their own way. There are more people alive today who know about the Jewish people and the story of Hashem than at any other point prior. The fact is Jews were restricted to Haaretz Yisrael. No one outside of this region of the world had any clue what a Jew was, let alone who they worshipped.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Jesus changed the nature of sin in multiple ways.</strong> Firstly, he stated that the only way to God was through him. That's objectively untrue and God does not need a doorman to have a relationship with his people. Secondly, Christianity endorses the need of believing in Jesus to be forgiven of sin and granted salvation/eternal life. God does not require belief in a third party to free you from sin. If you ask God for forgiveness and change your ways from that point forward, the Torah tells us our sins will not be held against us. Jesus is not part of that equation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>And one of the most important issues with Jesus. He did not accomplish anything the mashiach was meant to accomplish.</strong> The mashiach is not a payment plan. He doesn't come and do some things and then leave and come back to do others. The mashiach comes one time and he does everything he was meant to do. Jesus failed at this and his followers were aware of that enough that he promised to eventually come back and finish the job. It gets even more complicated when you realize Jesus promised he'd come back before the death of the last apostle. Meaning he was expected to return in maybe 30 or 40 years time from after he is claimed to have ascended to heaven. Christianity wrote that off and simply says \"He will one day return and fulfill the prophecy\" which isn't a claim found anywhere in Jewish scripture. Mashiach comes once and does everything in a single human lifetime.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The discussion in the Talmud does not deal with the actual Jesus and his actual acts, as has been established even by christian scholars like <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/3534049012\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Johann Maier</a>. The Talmud, written many years after the supposed events, does not deny that the miracles described by Christians could take place. However, the Talmud associates such miracles with deception, sorcery, and idolatry, which are forbidden in Judaism (Bavli Sanhedrin 107b and Sotah 47a). For example, Bavli Shabbos 104b R. Eliezer asks: But did not ben Stada bring forth witchcraft from Egypt by means of scratches/tatoos (<em>biseritah</em>) upon his flesh? (a similar point in Yerushalmi Shabbos 12:4/3).</p>\n<p>The message is, paraphrasing Peter Schaefer's words in \"<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691143187/jesus-in-the-talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jesus in Talmud</a>\" when he discussed cases of healing: the fact, that Heaven accepted some acts described by followers of Jesus, did not mean that it approved of them, because they were based on unauthorized and misused power. The fact, that something miraculous but not approved can happen, we learn in the Torah in parashas Chukas, when Moshe strikes the rock twice and water flows; however, the action is not approved by Hashem. The Talmud uses the subject to teach importance not to resort to such behavior. Judaism is a religion based on law and miracles are not viewed as a reason to abandon the law as the words about Navi Sheker tell us.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Eliezer explains that this was actually in the month of MarCheshvan after Tishrei (<em>when G-d judges the entire world</em>) and Rav Chisda, explaining the view of Rabbi Eliezer says that initially the waters from the flood were scalding hot. This suggests volcanic involvement, at least initially, like pyroclastic flows.</p>\n<p>Classic dating for this event attempts to count onward from the exile of Adam and Chava from Gan Eden and places the flood in the year 1656, 4,128 years ago like is found in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder HaDorot</a>.</p>\n<p>But archeologically and geologically, there is no obvious evidence for such a cataclysmic event in that time frame where all life (or even a vast majority of life) was wiped from the earth.</p>\n<p>But the details from Rabbi Eliezer point to something else entirely. Rabbi Eliezer is describing a very large celestial cycle connected to the shifting of Earth's pole star.</p>\n<p>He is saying that when the <em>binary star</em> in the <strong>constellation of Draco</strong> (Kima) was ascending (<em>meaning becoming Earth's pole star</em>), in the month of MarCheshvan, the flood began. The Draco constellation actually has about 8 different binary stars contained within it's pattern and not all of them align with the pole star pathway for Earth's view.</p>\n<p>That because the polar axis of the Earth wobbles slightly, <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the pole star changes over time</a> to align with various stars in the sky, in different constellations. This pattern of alignment can be charted out and anticipated with precision. One of the pole stars in that alignment is <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/tonight/see-draco-the-dragon-and-a-former-pole-star/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a binary star, called Thuban, in the constellation of Draco</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(constellation)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This binary star becomes the pole star for Earth every 26,000 years</a>.</p>\n<p>The last time Thuban was the pole star for Earth was from about 3942 BCE to 1793 BCE which was when the pyramids were being built in Egypt. That does not agree with the traditional time of the flood details like found in Seder HaDorot.</p>\n<p>But in the cycle prior to the last one, <em>which was approximately 30,000 BCE</em>, it coincides with a <em>very significant geological event</em>. It overlaps a period called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Last Glacial Maximum</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In the Last Glacial Maximum, much of the earth was covered with ice sheets,temperatures dropped significantly, desertification spread over large parts of the world creating dust bowls making agriculture extremely difficult  and sea levels dropped by almost 400 feet! Many of the details described in the Torah about the Earth not yielding up its produce willingly match these conditions like is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.17-19?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 3:17-19</a>. With sea levels dropping so precipitously, human settlements followed the waterlines to lowlands.</p>\n<p>There is archeological evidence  of such things like significant human settlement and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220113-dwarka-indias-submerged-ancient-city#\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">even cities under the ocean off the coast of India</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/lost-civilization-india-harappan-2667745370\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elsewhere</a>. Similarly, the remains from places like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gobekli-tepe-the-worlds-first-temple-83613665/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gobekli Tepe</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karahan_Tepe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Karahan Tepe</a> in Turkey extend back to these time frames.</p>\n<p>Following the Last Glacial Maximum, this process reversed itself, sometimes rapidly. Areas of human settlement could have been inundated and, in fact <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_deluge_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there is evidence of such things around the Black Sea in the vicinity of Mount Ararat</a>.</p>\n<p>Are there any traditional Torah sources which suggest, the flood story of Noach is actually an older human memory from this time period indicated by Rabbi Eliezer?</p>\n\n\n",

What does it mean 'with all your heart and\nwith all your soul'? It means with every soul that He has created\nwithin you. Rabbi Meir said, 'For every breath a person takes, he is\nobligated to praise his Creator.' From where is this derived? As it is\nstated (Tehillim 150:6), 'Let every soul praise Hashem.' Rabbi Simon\nsaid, 'Five names are given to the soul, and they are: Ruach,\nNefesh, Neshama, <strong>Chaya</strong>, and Yechida.' [Devarim Rabba\n2:37]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of those levels is Chaya.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חַיָּה, שֶׁכָּל הָאֵבָרִים מֵתִים וְהִיא חַיָּה בַּגּוּף.</p>\n<p>Chaya: As all the bodily organs die, while it lives on (\"chaya\") in the body.

Whereas the primary activity of the level of Neshama is to use intellectual comprehension in order to come to communion with G‑d as the Creator of the worlds, the level of Chaya communes with G‑d as He transcends the worlds. Here the soul's knowledge is not in the immanence of Divine attributes which identify the nature of the Divine energy manifested in Creation, but rather with knowing what G‑d is not — i.e. how He is not limited or defined by the finite universe. Thus the soul merges into a state of complete nullification of the ego. There is no self-seeking and no self-identity outside of G‑d. Chaya is called loving G‑d \"with all one's being\" (Deut. 6:5). This is knowledge of the absolute truth of things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Makor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380651/jewish/Neshamah-Levels-of-Soul-Consciousness.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chaya</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is an interesting question dealing with how to conceptualize these abstract Torah concepts found particularly in kabbalistic and chassidic teachings.</p>\n<p>To have a better comprehension of this subject, it first requires prefacing the idea that existence, meaning creation is broken into three general divisions, namely <em>World</em> (עולם), <em>Year</em> or <em>Change</em> (שנה), and <em>Spirit</em> (נפש). This is discussed in Sefer Midbar Kedmot by Rabbi Chaim Yoseph David Azulai and other places.</p>\n<p>These divisions are alluded to in the Written Torah in Shemot 19:18 and 20:14 which say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהַ֤ר סִינַי֙ <strong>עָשַׁ֣ן</strong> כֻּלּ֔וֹ מִ֠פְּנֵ֠י אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָרַ֥ד עָלָ֛יו יְהֹוָ֖ה בָּאֵ֑שׁ <strong>וַיַּ֤עַל עֲשָׁנוֹ֙</strong> כְּעֶ֣שֶׁן הַכִּבְשָׁ֔ן וַיֶּחֱרַ֥ד כׇּל־הָהָ֖ר מְאֹֽד׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכׇל־הָעָם֩ רֹאִ֨ים אֶת־הַקּוֹלֹ֜ת וְאֶת־הַלַּפִּידִ֗ם וְאֵת֙ ק֣וֹל הַשֹּׁפָ֔ר וְאֶת־הָהָ֖ר <strong>עָשֵׁ֑ן</strong> וַיַּ֤רְא הָעָם֙ וַיָּנֻ֔עוּ וַיַּֽעַמְד֖וּ מֵֽרָחֹֽק׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That one of the earliest paradigms of existence is the division into thirds, of right (ימין), left (שמאל) and center (אמצע), also called the three <em>Kavin</em> (קוין) or dimensions (מאימדות). That these 3 Kavin are comprised of: the aspect of <em>World</em> which is conceived of as the idea of <em>Space</em> in the nomenclature of the natural sciences, or <em>Place</em> (מקום) like is used in Yalkut Shimoni to Bereshit 28:11.</p>\n<p>The aspect of <em>Year</em> relates to the concept of <em>Time</em> in the nomenclature of the natural sciences, both non-linear time (זמן בלתי המשוער) and linear time (זמן משוער). Linear time is associated specifically to the principle of <em>Change</em> (משנה).</p>\n<p>The third aspect of Existence is the  aspect of <em>Soul</em> which in this usage is better translated as <em>Spirit</em> or <em>Spiritual</em>. This third aspect of existence, like Space and Time, is distinct and yet all three aspects are interwoven to make up our <em>tapestry of existence</em>.</p>\n<p>This paradigm of three dimensional existence is also expressed in our bodies with right hand, left hand and torso.</p>\n<p>With this introduction, we can now consider the five aspects or <em>dimensions</em>  of soul mentioned in your question.</p>\n<p>Like with our body and the five organs of the mouth (<em>throat, pallet, tongue, teeth and lips</em> See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yetzirah 2:3</a>), the five fingers of each hand, and the five toes of each foot (גודל, אצבע, אמה, קמיצה, זרת), these five dimensions of Nefesh (נפש), Ruach (רוח), Neshamah (נשמה), Chayah (חיה), and Yechidah (יחידה) are consequences (תולדות) or offspring (בנים), so to speak, of their higher, general, categorical root, <em>the Spirit</em> (הנפש, נפש).</p>\n<p>They are mentioned in ascending order and from the more specific and individual to the more general and inclusive.</p>\n<p>The first three terms associated to the Spirit are restricted in proper usage to the individual. They are associated with the <em>animating aspect</em> (נפש,נפש הבהמית) of the soul, meaning what interacts with material, physical existence, the emotive aspect of the soul (רוח) and the intellectual aspect of soul (נשמה). These latter two categories are not capable of interacting with material existence directly, but rather influence the animating soul, which is the bridge or link between material and spiritual existence.</p>\n<p>That the physical body (גוף) without a soul dressed within it, is considered <em>a dead body</em>, <em><strong>a corpse</strong></em> (פגר). So too, when the constituent parts of the individual soul are not woven together, that is death (מות). But when the individual, constituent parts of the soul remain woven together, even outside the material body, they retain the status of being alive.</p>\n<p>And just like with the 5 parts of the mouth and the 5 fingers and toes, the remaining two aspects of the Spirit, the Chayah and Yechidah are not about the individual (יחיד), but to the collective (צבור). This is in keeping with the concept in Halacha that <em>the Congregation doesn't die</em> (צבור לא מת).</p>\n<p>In this context, the distinction between the aspect of Spirit (הנפש) referred to as Chayah (חיה) and the aspect referred to as Yechidah (יחידה) are understood. That Chayah pertains to the vitality of all animate, living creations, while Yechidah is that aspect of Spirit pertaining to the vitality of all inanimate creations.</p>\n<p>That is all the time I have currently to write. There are many textual sources that still need to be listed and linked to this answer. But this should be sufficient to understand.</p>\n\n\n",

explained in this manner: It is already known regarding the\nsprinklings of Yom Kippur (Part 3, Chapter 58) that there was one\nabove and seven below, as will be explained in the laws of Yom Kippur,\nG-d willing. <strong>The reason is that they alluded to the evil inclination\nthat leads a person to sin, which is referred to by seven names.</strong>\nTherefore, the High Priest would sprinkle <strong>seven times below</strong> <strong>and one\ntime above, corresponding to the good inclination.</strong> He would count each\nof the lower sprinklings along with the upper one, as it is stated\n(Yoma 53b), \"and thus he would count, etc.,\" to teach that it is\nappropriate to combine the evil inclination with the good inclination,\nand then both together are good. He would sprinkle, as it is written\n(Yechezkel 36:25), \"I will sprinkle clean water upon you.\" All of this\nwill be explained, God willing, in the order of Yom Kippur (Part 3,\nChapter 59). Therefore, these sprinklings were done between the poles\nand on the curtain. It is already known from Part 1, Chapter 25, what\nthey symbolized, and in the manner I have written previously. (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shvilei Pinches then goes on to quote from a sefer called \"Shevet Sofer\", written by Rabbi Simchah Bunem Sofer, the grandson of the Chasam Sofer. The Shvilei Pinches says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his view, when the Kohen\nGodol sprinkled “one above and seven below,” he had in\nmind to make a case proving Yisroel’s merit before HKB”H in\nthe Kodesh HaKodoshim on Yom HaKippurim. The Gemoreh\n(Beroches 17a) presents a prayer recited by Rabbi Alexandri:\n”רבון העולמים גלוי וידוע לפניך שרצוננו לעשות רצונך ומי מעכב\n”שבעיסה שאור—Master of the Worlds, it is revealed and\nknown before You that our will is to perform Your will. And who\nprevents us from doing so? The yeast in the dough—the yetzer\nhora. This, too, is the message inherent in the Kohen Godol’s\nsprinkling and counting protocol in the Kodesh HaKodoshim on\nYom HaKippurim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Kohen Godol presented his case before HKB”H:\n”למעלה אחת —”he sprinkled one above, indicating that there\nis but one way to connect with HKB”H above--by means of\nthe yetzer tov. Conversely, ”למטה שבע—”the seven below\nindicated that there are seven ways by which one can fall into\nthe spiritual abyss as a result of the yetzer hora’s forces of evil.\nTherefore, it is appropriate for HKB”H to forgive Yisroel for all\nof their transgressions. The Shevet Sofer concludes: והוא”\nincredible an is this—רמז נפלא ודבר גדול גילה לנו הרמ“א בזה“\nmessage revealed to us by the Ramoh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have trouble understanding what the Shevet Sofer is explaining to us here.</p>\n<p>We have a wonderful teaching in the Gemara that \"we should always incite our good inclination against our evil inclination\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Berachos 5a)</a>, can the words of the Shevet Sofer mean that the one time the Kohen Gadol sprinkles upwards, referring to the yetzer tov, symbolises that we should incite the yetzer tov to overcome the yetzer hara?</p>\n<p><strong>Anyone able to expound this teaching? I am also looking for his original words (of the Shevet Sofer). Does anyone have access to his sefer on this?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

The Jewish people can claim that they were coerced into accepting the Torah, and it is therefore not binding.\n\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Was this negative experience a necessity? Could Har Sinai revelation be fun and a happy and positive experience for all participants? Couldn't the air be filled with flowers and serpentine instead of bolts of lightning, and couldn't they hear the voice of violins instead of war-summoning Shofar?</p>\n<p>Why couldn't this epiphany be the best experience of their (short) lives?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The definition of <em>negative</em> depends on perspective. For a former powerless slave who just ran from an excruciating bondage it was very important and encouraging to align oneself with the power greater than one could imagine. Indeed, the Arab tribes even today make alignments with stronger powers at all costs, even religious costs, in a fight for survival. On the other hand, for a person of grown in the West the description of <em>Matan Torah</em> in the Talmud may appear coercive. There is a discussion in the Gemara and the comments (brought in Artscroll) for why coercion took place.</p>\n<p>The experience at Mt.

(I.e. their commitment could have been rescinded on the basis that it was made without knowledge of awesome consequences - Artscroll).</p>\n<p>The proof is given from other nations: And [regarding] that which it said [that the other nations said in their defense for not accepting the Torah] in the first chapter of Avodah Zarah (2b), \"Did you overturn the mountain above us like a tub?\" - which implies that if He had overturned [it] above them, they would not have had an answer/excuse (for refusing to accept the Torah). Whereas here it said that it [itself] is a <em>substantial caveat to the Torah</em>: That means [that it is not an excuse, but rather a reason that would have made them guilty] for their not accepting it (the Torah). But regarding their not keeping it, it would have been an [excuse].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maharal, Tiferes Israel ch. 32</strong>, asks, why did G-d not first wait to see if the people would renege, and then force their acceptance if necessary? He answers that G-d wanted that the Jewish answer \"We will do and we will hear\", which was made out of love, to be binding forever. Hence, He did not want to risk drawing a new coercion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Noach.3.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma, Noach 3</a>, states that the words \"We will do and we will hear\" signaled acceptance only of the Written law.

But at the time of Achashverosh, they accepted [it] with their consent from love of the miracle. And [regarding] that which Yehoshua made a covenant with them to serve God - there they only accepted not to worship idolatry.

[Exodus 24:7]\n[At that time], the Holy One said, “The orchard shall be saved on account of this flower. For the sake of the Torah and of Israel the world shall be saved.” [Vayikra Rabbah 23:3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this, the tradition emerged that Mount Sinai blossomed with flowers right before the giving of the Torah.</p>\n<p>One of the five traditions of Shavuot, when we celebrate the giving of the Torah, is to decorate homes and synagogues with plants, flowers and tree branches. The earliest mention of this custom is by the Maharil, from 15th-century Germany.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is an excellent observation - Har Sinai is described in the Chumash as a physically terrible experience for klal yisrael.  This is consistent throughout Tanach that encountering G-d or angels is often disturbing or even terrifying for the human involved - e.g., Moshe at the burning bush, Yakov upon waking up from his dream, Gideon and Manoach both thinking they would die after meeting an angel, Yeshayahu saying woe is me during one of his prophecies, Daniel and his companions being terrified and losing their strength during one of his prophecies.</p>\n<p>This is a signicant topic - here are three high level approaches to this: the simplest is literary - during the time period of the Tanach, this was the way all ancient cultures described their respective deities and religions.  Thus, the Tanach was written in the style of the times that made sense to the audience of the time - terror at Mt. Sinai is consistent with how all early religions described encountering heavenly beings.</p>\n<p>Second, the terror experienced at Mt. Sinai speaks to Theodicy/Tzadik vra lo - why bad things sometimes happen to good people.  Rav Nachman in Likutei Maharan discusses the episode at Mt. Sinai at length and explains it is a metaphor for the challenges that G-d must impose upon jews in order for us to have free will / grow as individuals.</p>\n<p>Third, the terror that humans encounter throughout Tanach experiencing G-d and angels is part of a broader pattern to encourage Jews to focus on living in this world (while following the Mitzvot) and less so on anything outside this world/supernatural - there is almost no mention of any afterlife in Tanach, magic is not allowed, the Mishkan is described as deadly and only safe for a select few, encountering G-d is described as terrifying and only fitting for a select few.  The broad idea is presumably that a Jew must focus on this world and succeed here (especially in his relationships with others here) before being ready to meet and greet his maker.  (Rav Kook discusses the concept of human relationships being \"practice\" for an eventual relationship with G-d in many places)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did the Har Sinai revelation only include commandments?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the Har Sinai revelation, God spoke to the nation <em>only</em> the Ten Commandments. He could, for example, give a very different speech, for example, include theology, as He did with Job (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Job.38.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">38.1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundations?<br />\nSpeak if you have understanding.<br />\nDo you know who fixed its dimensions<br />\nOr who measured it with a line?<br />\nOnto what were its bases sunk?\n...\nHave you ever commanded the day to break,<br />\nAssigned the dawn its place,<br />\nSo that it seizes the corners of the earth\nAnd shakes the wicked out of it?  ...\nHave you surveyed the expanses of the earth?\nIf you know of these—tell Me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>maybe discuss cosmology, or repeat the words He said to Moses (Ex 19.3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Me.<br />\nNow then, if you will obey Me faithfully and keep My covenant, you shall be My treasured possession among all the peoples. Indeed, all the earth is Mine, but you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another option that comes to mind is the blessings, as in Lev 26.3, I bet Israel would love to hear those promises from God's mouth:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If you follow My laws and faithfully observe My commandments,\nI will grant your rains in their season, so that the earth shall yield its produce and the trees of the field their fruit.\nYour threshing shall overtake the vintage, and your vintage shall overtake the sowing; you shall eat your fill of bread and dwell securely in your land.\nI will grant peace in the land, and you shall lie down untroubled by anyone; I will give the land respite from vicious beasts, and no sword shall cross your land.\n[Your army] shall give chase to your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But God chose to dedicate this once-in-history event to relaying the Ten Commandments that, weirdly enough, have no particular importance in Judaism.</p>\n<p>Hence my question: why did God's revelation on Har Sinai only include commandments (<em>given that \"I'm YHWH thy God\" is the first one</em>)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Torah is a contract which Jewish people made with Hashem. We have 2 verses in Vayikra: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.42?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">25:42</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.55?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">25:55</a>: <em>For it is to Me that the Israelites are servants: they are My servants, whom I freed from the land of Egypt — I, your God Hashem.</em> According to the p'shat: Hashem took us out of the Egyptian bondage and made us His servants.  (Rashi says that His acquisition contract is older, i.e. has priority over anything else). A master or a king open the contract with the list of rules. We are not really \"partners\".</p>\n<p>(Of course one can sweeten it with meaning of true freedom as service of G-d). Sefer Iyov is not a contract, it is a long answer to a question. In fact Hashem did not speak in commandments with anybody in sefer Bereshis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Think about how Hashem rescued us from Egypt, with this whole build up to this great meeting and worship on a mountain. One can imagine how exciting that must have been for Benei Yisrael, and what was going through their mind - the awesome creator of the whole universe, who performs all these wonders on our behalf,  and revealed Himself at the splitting of the sea, and has shown His great love for us and desire to be our God and us His people, has done all this for this great meeting! What is He going to say? Was He going to teach them the secrets of Torah and life? Show them the heavens? Take them to Gan Eden?</p>\n<p>Turns out, He wanted tell us to be nice to our mother, as well as a list of other dos and don'ts, and that's it? On the face of it, this needs an answer.</p>\n<p>The Torah's Mitzvot are not simply a list of dos and don'ts. The revelation at Sinai wasn't a revelation of law. <em>It was a revelation of Hashem</em>. Hashem was telling us that not murdering, being nice to our mother etc. are not just good rules for a society, and Shabbat is not just Hashem's wise idea for us to help us keep families together.</p>\n<p>No, the Torah and Mitzvot are Hashem's revelation to us. The whole Torah is informing us about <em>Him</em> - things we wouldn't know unless He told us. <em>He</em> hates murder, absolutely. <em>He</em> needs us to be nice to our mothers - that's an absolute value for Him. It's <em>His</em> Shabbat that He is sharing with us, and inviting us to.</p>\n<p>This is why Har Sinai is likened to a wedding between us and Him - He is telling us about Him; <strong>what is essential to Him</strong>, which we need to know if we are to be wed to Him, to worship Him and to be in this relationship with Him. Just like a marriage, we need to get to know each other. He knows us, but we didn't know Him. The Torah, therefore, is His love note to us, His revelation to us, and the Mitzvot He gives us will enable us to connect to Him and be truly wed, because the Mitzvot are His essential will.</p>\n<p>This is based on many Chassidic concepts, including that the Mitzvot are \"nogeah b'Atzmus\"; Na'aseh v'Nishma and connecting to Hashem as the Baal HaRatzon; and is explained exquisitly by Rabbi Manis Friedman in several shiurim, which I will link here soon.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to pronounce שׁוֹמְרִים?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom to all.</p>\n<p>I am not sure how to pronounce the following word, which comes up in prayer (e.g. in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.130.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 130</a>):  שׁוֹמְרִים.</p>\n<p>On one hand, I learned that Sheva after big vowels (Patach, Ṣere…) is independent. Based on this the pronunciation would be “shoMErim”.</p>\n<p>On another hand, I’ve heard some people read this word as “shoMrim,” with a silent Sheva.</p>\n<p>Which is correct? Please explain. Are there exceptions to the rule? Thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It’s a Shva na`.</p>\n<p>Many people, especially in certain Ashkenazic communities, ignore the rules of Shva. Shva isn’t such an important vowel, so this (usually) isn’t problematic, but it’s not accurate either.</p>\n<p>(Note: There is a <a href=\"https://books.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/obp.0163.02.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">scholarly opinion</a> that this kind of Shva was silent in the Tiberian Masoretic tradition. Even if that was case, we don’t follow that rule today, so it’s irrelevant; and if it <em>were</em> relevant, we'd have to be extra careful with vowel length distinctions; far more careful than those who believe that this Shva is Nach, and who likely don’t know what vowel length is).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It's a bit complicated because sometimes rules conflict, for example שַׁרְבִיט, there's one rule that shva followed by a בּ is silent and followed by a ב is vocal, but usually a shva that closed patach is silent so this case is complicated, or in a case like מַלְכֵי vs מַלְכִּי, or similarly in וַתְּכַבֵּד what is type of dagesh is the תּ? It cannot be תּ because the patach makes it a closed syllable and a closed syllable it has to be rapha, It cannot be ת because because it has to open the syllable to be a vocal shva, and the כ rapha demands a vocal shva before it.\nIn your case probably is vocal because it's after a long vowel. In a shva after the qamets in שָׁ֫מְרוּ there seems to be an argument if silent or pronounced, if this qamets is considered long</p>\n\n\n",

When Moshe Rabbeinu brought the Tablets on the 17th of Tammuz, he had to smash them because of the Golden Calf, which delayed receiving of the Torah. After that Moshe prayed for 40 days and nights and then went up to Mt. Sinai to receive the second Tablets, which he brought after Yom Kippur on the 10th of Tishrei. The bringing of the second Tablets set in motion the process of learning the Torah and doing many mitzvos connected with the building of the Mishkan.</p>\n<p>When there was Temple, there was much singing after Yom Kippur, as described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ta%27anit.4.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Taanis 4.8</a>.

Some say that originally Jewish people could learn all of the Torah from the text of the written Torah without a need for the books of prophets and writings. One way or another, the story of receiving the Torah is not complete. It is also one of the reasons why the blessings on the Torah are formulated in the present, i.e. that G-d is teaching Jewish people the Torah and giving us the Torah now, every moment.</p>\n\n\n",

It is also used in many different mitzvos including 10 commandments: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 20:13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.14?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 20:14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 5:17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 5:18</a>.

In particular, when Dathan and Aviram were fighting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.2.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 2:13</a>:</p>\n<p>וַיֵּצֵא֙ בַּיֹּ֣ום הַשֵּׁנִ֔י וְהִנֵּ֛ה שְׁנֵֽי־אֲנָשִׁ֥ים עִבְרִ֖ים נִצִּ֑ים וַיֹּ֨אמֶר֙ לָֽרָשָׁ֔ע לָ֥מָּה תַכֶּ֖ה <strong>רֵעֶֽךָ</strong>׃</p>\n<p>Moshe is using the word רֵעֲךָ when rebuking one of them. The reason is that the word רֵעַ means one who has something in common with another, often a bond of friendship (Artscroll Rashi commentary). Hence, Rashi comments: \"THY FELLOW\" (the word denotes one who is the equal of another) — <em>who is as wicked as yourself</em> (Exodus Rabbah 1:29). Because the word is used in 10 commandments, it means that all Jews became רֵעִים.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I think, loving the ones who are closest, like neighbors, parents, siblings, spouses, is harder, because that is where the relationship can get tested for real. When dealing with people who stay far, issues that are mentioned in the above negative <em>mitzvos</em> are much less likely to arise due to distance.</p>\n<p>The positive mitzvah to love one's neigbor, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.243?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer haChinuch 243</a> is also formulated in the <strong>negative</strong>:  (Shabbat 31a), “<em>What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow</em>.” And they said in Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 4:12, “Rabbi Akiva said, ‘This is a great principle in the Torah’” — meaning to say that many commandments are dependent upon it. As one that loves his fellow like himself will not steal from him, will not have adultery with his wife, will not cheat him of goods or oppress him with words, will not move his boundary, and will not harm him in any way. So are many other religious duties bound up with it; the matter is evident to every understanding person. (translation of R. Elchanan (Charles) Wengrow). It means that at the bare minimum one has to fulfil all negative precepts <em>bein adam l'chaveiro</em>, which necessarily include <strong>רֵעֶֽךָ</strong> as the most likely <em>chaveiro</em>. Without <strong>רֵעֶֽךָ</strong> one could make a case that loving permits violating the above negative mitzvos.</p>\n<p>The point is even strenthened with the fact that taking vengeance and grudge is formulated in plural, while loving the neighbor in the sigular. Revenging or bearing grudges or any other negative action is usually decided based on a limited number of bad character traits and can easily be extended to several people lacking such good qualities. At the same time, loving at the minimum is abstaining from all prohibitions <em>bein adam l'chaveiro</em>. Since some of the negative commandments are also formulated in the singular רֵעֲךָ, even at the minimum, we must have such personal conditioning when loving another Jewish person.</p>\n\n\n",

Multiple Biblical Mitzvos aim at remembering and enacting the event, such as retelling the story to future generations, preparing and eating the sacrifice, consuming Matza, and more. Even Succos is mentioned as the remembrance and enacting of living in Succos in the wilderness (albeit we see no textual mention of the Israelites dwelling in Succos during Exodus).</p>\n<p>Matan Torah was, undoubtedly, a pivotal event in the history of Jewish people, however, there's no Mitzvah of remembering that day or event and replicating it yearly. IIRC, the night Torah study (Tikun Leyl Shavuos) was established only in the 16th century.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Edit: <strong>this question is specifically about the Torah view, not Rabbinic commentary</strong>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kli_Yakar_on_Leviticus.23.16.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kli Yakar</a> in parshas Emor addresses why there is no mention in the Torah that Shevous is commemorating Matan Torah. He says since the Torah is a constant, and is always supposed to be viewed anew, Hashem didn't make any particular day the explicit commemoration, as that would limit it to one day. Rather every day should be view as a new day of receiving the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This specific question has actually bothered R. Nathan Laufer to write an entire book about it. \"<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/collections/rabbi-nathan-laufer/products/rendezvous-with-godhardcoverstandard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rendezvous with God. Revealing the Meaning of the Jewish Holidays and Their Mysterious Rituals</a>\". He said in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3EVbgEMLyk&list=PL7vIg-Z6JVAEFYoQ5_t4brnrsnpmhJnMo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">podcast on Judaism Demystified</a> that it is inconceivable that the celebration of the experience of receiving of the Torah has not found its way into Judaic holiday experience. Specifically, he makes the point that the holiday of Rosh haShanah, which we call <em>Yom haZikaron</em>, is about rememberance. Rememberance of what? Which day do we need to remember when facing Hashem's Judgement? He points out, based on what we do on Rosh haShanah is that we are remembering the day when we stood at <em>har Sinai</em> when receiving the Torah. Facing the Judgement of G-d is the awesome experience, which can certainly compare with what happened at Mt. Sinai, when people were dying and getting revived. (Recall Unesaneh Tokef).</p>\n<p>During musaf of Rosh Hashanah we recite 10 verses for each of the <em>malkiyoth</em>, <em>zichronoth</em>, and <em>shofaroth</em> blessings. This corresponds to 10 <em>dibroth</em>. Many congregations opt to blow shofar 10 times right after each one of the blessings, both in the silent tefilah and in the repetition. One blow for each saying. That's also exactly a reference to the Sinai experience.</p>\n<p>I think R. Laufer's point that Matan Torah and standing at Har Sinai is hinted on Rosh Hashanah, the celebrated Day of Creation, can be found in the second Rashi comment on the Torah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parashat Bereshis</a>: Bereshis Bara (In the beginning of G-d's Creating): This verse says nothing but \"Explain me!\" It is to be understood as as the Rabbis of the blessed memory expounded it: For the Torah, which is called \"The beginning of His way\", and for Israel, who are called \"the first of His crop\". Here's where Rosh Hashanah (act of creation) got connected to Matan Torah with <em>gzeira shava</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -8)\n\n<p>The Torah isn't shy about telling the future. The Torah recounts how God promised Abraham he will be a great people in the future, he will inherit the land of Israel and that his descendants will sojourn for hundreds of years and be enslaved. But where's the prophecy of the giving of the Torah? I haven't found such a prophecy, have you?</p>\n<p>The closest hint I've seen is that when God is about to destroy Sodom and Amorah God mentions that Abraham will teach his descendants righteousness and justice... But we also don't see that happen. Can anyone point to a story in which Isaac's Torah knowledge and righteousness is on display? Jacob and Esau don't seem like they're being raised in righteousness and justice, but rather strife and jealousy. Which makes their redemption into righteous loving brothers so much more powerful in my opinion, but regardless. Why isn't the Torah talking about the wonderful Torah these people should have been learning/living?</p>\n<p>My answer is that God might not have perceived as handing the Torah over as one of His original plans. Afterall, God seems to believe that we humans can intuit some things as right vs wrong naturally, otherwise how could God be angry at Adam for disobeying? Or warning Kain to try and dissuade him from letting his anger/jealousy consume him into murdering his brother. I don't believe God always planned to give Kain a mark, but instead chose to be in relation with Kain and humans and therefore gave Kain a mark. I believe the same is true with the Torah.</p>\n<p>God wants to be in relation with us. And so I don't think it's fruitful to talk about whether God is perfect or not, whether God changes Their mind or not. Because regardless of God's attributes/actions, the relationship will only survive if God is in relation to our attributes/actions. Our relationship with God is described as parent child and husband wife, both of these relationships require both parties to change and adapt to each other.</p>\n<p>And therefore it seems to me that God saw the golden calf, saw Moses as a worthy figure of teaching the people, and then for the good of us, His now chosen people, He gave us the Torah through Moses who merited being the one to teach it. God didn't change His mind, God was in relation to Moses and the Israelites. But it seems to me that God didn't give the Torah to the whole nation, He gave it to Moses, which would explain why we lack a national celebration.</p>\n\n\n",

A sin is counted only if it happens three times or more. If these repeated sins outweigh a person's good deeds, then any lesser sins are also included in the judgment. If a person's good deeds are equal to or greater than the sins committed more than three times, they receive forgiveness for their sins one by one. The third sin is forgiven as it is treated like a first sin because the earlier two were already pardoned. This pattern continues: after forgiving the third sin, the fourth is seen as a first sin and is also forgiven, following the same principle. This approach applies to an individual, as referenced in Job 33:29, which states that God will act multiple times with a person. In contrast, for a community, punishment for the first three sins is put on hold, as indicated by Amos 2:6, which says retribution is withheld for the first three sins but not for the fourth. When assessing a community's sins, the evaluation begins with the fourth sin. A Beinoni, someone whose good deeds and sins are balanced, is treated according to this method. However, if this person has never performed the mitzvah of tefillin, they will be judged based on their sins but will still receive a place in the world to come. Likewise, even those who are deemed wicked and have more sins than merits are judged on their wrongdoings but will also be granted a portion in the world to come, as every Israelite has a share, shown in Isaiah 60:21, which notes that all of God’s people are righteous and will inherit everlasting life. The same applies to the righteous among the nations, who also have a place in the world to come.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm more proficient in Yiddish but I'm slowly absorbing a bit of Hebrew. Looking through texts edited by Hasidic publishers, Modern Hebrew reference tools, Aramaic reference books in Yiddish, etc, I noticed that there are differences in the nikkud of some words. For example, in the Barditchever Siddur and in a recent Siddur from the Ateres publisher, the words כך and ברכת appear as כַּך and בִּרְכַת instead of כָּך and בִּרְכַּת. In both cases, the difference in nikkud would mean a difference in any Ashkenazi pronunciation that I know of.\nMy question is if these difference in nekudos that I'm associating with Ashkenazi Hebrew or Yiddish are valid ways of pronouncing these words for things like davening, bentching and leining, or if these forms are \"wrong\". I think it's interesting to apply this question to two different sets of words:</p>\n<p>1 - Words that appear in Tanach;\nLike פֶּסַח and not בִּרְכַּת, פֵּסַח and not בִּרְכַת.</p>\n<p>2 - Words that do not appear in Tanach but do appear in the Talmud, Siddur, etc.\nFor example, תֵּיכֶּף-תֵּיכֶף, כָּך-כַּך, סְתַּם-סְתָם.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it pure metaphor, and if so what is the analog?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>There are a few answers in addition to the יפה תואר quoted by @Y DJ:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) The Shem Mishmuel (Parashat Tezaveh שנת תרע\"ג)</strong> says that the light that was created on the first day, which allowed Adam Harishon to see from one end of the world to the other, does not mean that it was a very great light that enabled one to see to the furthest distance in a physical sense. After all, if the earth were flat, this would make sense, but the earth is spherical, and therefore, the earth's parts and its elevations would obstruct his view. Rather we must understand it like Tosafot Shabbat 22b ד״ה וכי לאורה\nquoting Braita of Malechet Hamishkan where it is mentioned that one could look at a pot and know what was inside, or at a barrel and know what was within. This vision is not a physical one, as physical objects obstruct other physical objects, but rather it is a spiritual vision, like seeing with Ruach Hakodesh where one sees and perceives as if the object were right in front of them, and physical matter does not obstruct spiritual perception. The source of this light lies in the deep attachment in an intense bond with Hashem. This is  power given to creations, enables them to cling to such an intense bond. (similar to the Bal Shem Tov that @Rabbi Kaii quoted)</p>\n<p><strong>2) The Sefat Emet (Chanuka 5661 and Vayera 566)</strong> says a simialr idea to the Shem Mishmuel. Rashi on Shemot 3:14 says that the term Olam (world) is related to he’elim (to hide), indicating that the natural world conceals Hashem's presence to allow for free will. Ordinary light reveals only the physical aspects of objects, while the ohr haganuz not only showed physical properties but also the spiritual essence and Hashem's presence. This light allowed Adam Harishon to see from one end of the world to the other, revealing Hashem's guiding hand, involvment and care for the world beyond the natural world's concealment.</p>\n<p><strong>3) The Degel Machaneh Ephraim (Parshat Beresheit ד\"ה וירא)</strong> says that the pasuk says, \"וירא אלקים את האור כי טוב,\" the Midrash states that \"good\" means it was good to be hidden, and He hid it for the righteous. The righteous use this light in every generation. He heard from his grandfather that this light was hidden in the Torah (Zohar Chadash, Introduction, 1:264). Therefore, the righteous in every generation use this light, meaning through the Torah, which contains this light that allows them to see from one end of the world to the other. He says that he has personally witnessed several stories which where tzadikim truly saw from one end of the world to the other, and all this was through that light hidden in the Torah (he seems to understand the word אדם not just reffering to אדם הראשון, but tzadikim as well).\nThe Bal Haturim (Beresheit 1:4) says this idea is is hinted at in the words, \"את האור\" which has the same numerical value as \"בתורה,\" in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The commentary יפה תואר / Yafe Toar explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הדרשנים אומרים שאור זה רמז להשגת השכל, שהיה משכיל ראשונה כל חלקי\nהמציאות ואחר כך קצרה לסיבת נטיית המפורסמות, ובפרט לדור המבול.</p>\n<p>The <em>darshanim</em> say that it is a hint to the original ability of his\nmind to perceive all parts of reality (i.e he had no need to break\nreality in parts to perceive its complete essence).

Shabbat is a holy day when the illumination from holiness is\nrevealed, which is Hashem, the Holy of Holies,\nwho shines upon the creatures. Meaning, the concept of the spirituality of\neverything is connected to the Primordial Thought, which is the life\nforce of everything. Afterwards, when everything was created in reality through\nthe spiritual cosmos (השתלשלות), that same spirituality remained above, concealed\nin its root. The life force in the creatures is very small, having\nbeen contracted to be able to be enclothed in physical bodies. After\neverything was completed on the sixth day, if the world had remained\nin this state of creation, it would not have been able to endure.\n[Therefore], <strong>after the completion of all the acts of creation, Hashem shone a bright light from this part of the creation that was concealed,\nwhich is the state in which the creatures existed in His primordial\nthought, a very spiritual state. This ray shone from one end of the\nworld to the other, over all creation.</strong> The main recipient of this\nlight was man, the most select of creatures. Hashem shone a bright light upon him from the hidden root within the\nPrimordial Thought of Hashem. This is the meaning of \"What\nwas the world lacking? Rest,\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit%20Rabbah%2010:9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 10:9</a>) meaning Hashem is\ncalled \"Rest.\" When Shabbat arrived, Rest arrived. This means that the\nhidden reality of the creatures, which is from His Essence, blessed be\nHe, shone. Then they were filled with yearning and will towards\nHim, just as a child who follows childish activities, and forgets his\nfather, but when he sees his father, he throws everything away and\nclings to him, running towards him because he is a part of his father, and because he yearns for him.\nSimilarly, when Hashem shines the ray of\nHis splendor on the creatures, their faces are turned towards Him\nwith great need. This is what He hopes for and desires from them,\nand this is the reason for their existence. This is the concept of\nShabbat, which is the arrival at the root, meaning the root shines oon\nthe branches, and the branches long for and delight in Him, yearning\nfor Him. This is the unity of Hashem, blessed be He.</p>\n<p>As it is said in the Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar,%20Terumah%2014:164\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II 135a</a>), \"The mystery of Shabbat is that it is\nunited with the mystery of oneness, for the precious throne is united\nin the mystery of oneness.\" Meaning, the creatures are\ncollectively called the throne of Hashem, blessed be He, as it\nis written, \"The heavens are My throne\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.66.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 66:1</a>). <strong>The creatures are many in\ntheir external aspect, but in their internal aspect, they are one.\nWhen are they one? When they are attached and their longing is for one\npurpose – to cling to Hashem, blessed be He.</strong> Thus, all their\ndesires and pursuits are for one will and one desire – to cling to Him\nas one. This attachment is what unifies and connects Hashem,\nblessed be He, with the creatures, so that they may endure through\nHashem, blessed be He, who is one. This connection is called a covenant, which is why it\nis called an eternal covenant, for then there is a union between Hashem, and His Shechinah. Hashem, blessed be He, is the Divinity that is hidden from the creatures, and His\nShechinah is the Divinity that dwells among the lower beings. Their\nconnection happens on Shabbat. It is already known that what happened\nonce is always aroused at that time, and especially on Shabbat, it\nmust be so because in His goodness, He renews the work of creation\nconstantly, and each day is a new creation, with new creatures of the\ninanimate, vegetative, living, and speaking realms, until Shabbat\narrives, and HaMakom is awakened to give life to\nthem, as it was at the time of their initial creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>To extract from this stunning piece what is relevant, in my own words and understanding:</p>\n<p>Our true reality - the true reality of all creations, and especially mankind - is ultimately lofty: clinging to Hashem's very Primordial Thought; the inner of the inner of His Divinity. As such, we are all truly one with Him in our internal essence, and indeed the whole world, from end to end, is one as a result.</p>\n<p>However, this reality is hidden from us when we are in a body, in the same way that a child gets lost in his childish games and forgets about his father.</p>\n<p>The \"light\" that shone is a metaphor for the revelation to the lower beings of the lofty truth of our existence, and the experiece of that revelation is similar to the experience of a child who, in the middle of his game, suddenly sees his father, and immediately yearns for him, and drops everything to go run after him.</p>\n<p>When this light shines, we experience great desire and need for Hashem, fulfilling His own desire and need; the purpose of creation. This experience illuminates for us the true nature of creation - that it is all one with Hashem, and thus we \"see from one end of the world to another\", in a single glance.</p>\n\n\n",

I've heard that this word can be translated as an adjective to mean \"simple\" (I don't speak very good Hebrew). Is this meaning of the word more slang than the actual meaning of the word? Why would Yaakov be described as simple? In English translations of the Torah, people even translate it this way. Is this in juxtaposition to Esau because of how what he was doing was a more \"complicated\" thing in his life, for he is described as צַיִד.</p>\n<p>Do people actually consider Yaakov to be simple? If so, when do people consider him to become more complicated when that is after he is given a new name from Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The original meaning for the word תם - wholesome, as explained by Rashi on the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.18.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 18:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You must be <strong>wholehearted/perfect</strong> (תמים) with your God יהוה, i.e. walk before him whole-heartedly, put thy hope in Him and do not attempt to investigate the future, but whatever it may be that comes upon thee accept it whole-heartedly, and then thou shalt be with Him and become His portion (Sifrei Devarim 173:3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are also explanations based on reading the word תם backwards, i.e. מת - dead. I.e. תם is the opposite in every respect of being dead.</p>\n<p>In life mostly simple people tend to be wholehearted (hence the modern usage and usage in Passover Hagadah). However, Yaakov <em>avinu</em> was very a smart and learned person for his time, and he remained wholesome despite his trials in life.</p>\n<p>The etimilogical dictionary by Ernest Klein <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%AA%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%9D.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translates תם</a> as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 complete, perfect.     2 innocent, artless.   PBH  3 naive.   PBH  4 without blemish.  [From תמם.] Derivative: תַּמּוּת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>where PBH = Post Biblical Hebrew. Perhaps, the post biblical meaning has been acquired due to Passover Haggadah, where the 3rd son is asking a question, which appears simpler compared to those of the first two sons. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.10.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 10:4</a> names the sons as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּנֵּי רִבִּי חִייָה. כְּנֶגֶד אַרְבָּעָה בָּנִים דִּיבְּרָה תוֹרָה. בֶּן חָכָם בֶּן רָשָׁע בֶּן <strong>טִיפֵּשׁ</strong> בֶּן שֶׁאֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ לִשְׁאָל.\nRebbi Ḥiyya stated “The Torah spoke about Four Children, a wise child, a wicked child, a <strong>stupid</strong> child, and a child who does not know how to ask.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>where, the word טִיפֵּשׁ means stupid. The same wording is used in Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 13:14:1 quoted by Rashi in the commentary on Chumash where he explains the verse quoted by the child in the Haggada <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.14?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 13:14</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה זאת WHAT IS THIS? — This is the question of a dull child (תינוק טפש) who has not sufficient understanding to question very profoundly and who therefore asks in an indefinite fashion, “What is this?” In another passage (Deuteronomy 6:20) it states, “[When thy son asketh thee…], What mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments … [which the Lord our God hath commanded you?]” This, however, is the question of a wise son. The Torah in mentioning four different explanations of the Passover sacrifice-rite to be given by a father to his children, is speaking in reference to four different types of son: the wicked son (Shemos 12:25 and in the second half ofShemos 13:8), and one who has not sufficient understanding how to ask (<strong>טִיפֵּשׁ</strong>, in the first half of Shemos 13:8), and one who asks in an indefinite manner (Shemos 13:14), and one who asks in a wise fashion (Devarim 6:20) (cf. Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 13:14:1; Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 10:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Passover Haggadah changed the wording, however, the old understanding continued:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כְּנֶגֶד אַרְבָּעָה בָנִים דִּבְּרָה תוֹרָה: אֶחָד חָכָם, וְאֶחָד רָשָׁע, וְאֶחָד <strong>תָּם</strong>, וְאֶחָד שֶׁאֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ לִשְׁאוֹל.\nThe Torah relates to four types of sons – one who is wise, one who is wicked, one <strong>tam</strong> - with a simple nature, and one who does not know how to ask.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vilna Gaon in his commentary on Haggadah mentions that this is a simple understanding. The message of the Haggada is deeper. I.e. the sons are not grouped linearly by their ability to ask a question, but in pairs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חכם - a wise son vs. שֶׁאֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ לִשְׁאוֹל - one who cannot ask;\nרָשָׁע - a wicked son vs. תָּם - a wholesome son</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, a wholesome son is not going to strike others with the most complex question: he is interested in the whole experience of the seder, just like the wicked son seeks to separate himself from the seder. Perhaps, that was the intent to change the word <strong>טִיפֵּשׁ</strong> to <strong>תָּם</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

As I YHWH your God am an impassioned God, thy shall have no other gods besides Me.\nThy shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, or any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is Hashem's love for Israel not mentioned as the basis for the prohibition of idolatry either in the Ten Commandments or anywhere else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Trying to answer With the help of Torah Temimah.</p>\n<p>The mitzvah of loving G-d is derived from the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.5?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:5</a>.\nIn connection with this verse several different definitions of what loving G-d can be made.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On this verse Rashi says,</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fulfill His commands out of love, for one who acts out of love is not like him (is on a higher plane than one) who acts out of fear. He who serves his master out of fear, if he (the master) troubles him overmuch, leaves him and goes away (Sifrei Devarim 32:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, according to Rashi, mitzvah of loving G-d is <em>an additional requirement which is fulfilled with each and every mitzvah</em>. In this case, one cannot derive prohibition of idolatry as it can be kept simply out of fear of G-d (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.20?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 10:20</a>), the second of which Rashi comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THOU SHALT FEAR THE LORD THY GOD, and serve Him and <strong>cleave to Him</strong>; and after you possess all these qualities, then you may swear by His Name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.86a.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 86a</a> offers another definition</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abaye said: As it was taught in a baraita that it is stated: “And you shall love the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 6:5), which means that <em>you shall make the name of Heaven beloved</em>. How should one do so? One should do so in that he should read Torah, and learn Mishna, and serve Torah scholars, and he should be pleasant with people in his business transactions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This definition, as noted in the Gemara further, when violated can be viewed as desecration of the Name, but not idolatry.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>One can also even follow the statement of Rambam about joint Love-fear (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.2.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Yesodei haTorah 2:1</a>):</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a mitzvah to love and fear this glorious and awesome God, as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: \"And you shall love God, your Lord\" and, as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: \"Fear God, your Lord.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This definition is probably the closest in implying prohibition of idolatry. As Torah Temimah notes that in case of tribulations a person may say - I do not want to keep the commandments, however because of fear one will still keep them. As one see here, it's brought together with two separate verses, not one. Rambam is not even using a more suitable verse for it <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 11:1</a>. Still, these are additional verses, as opposed to explicit prohibitions of idolatry in Sefer Shemos and other books of Torah. Thus, one has to conclude that one can serve idols despite love of Hashem and despite fear of Hashem. Perhaps, a good example - people responding to the miracle that Hashem did for Eliyahu on Mt. Carmel.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Rambam when formulating his eighth principle of faith, that the Torah that we have is the same as was given to Moshe by Hashem refers to gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.99a.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedin 99a</a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught in another baraita: “Because he has despised the word of the Lord”; this is a reference to one who says the Torah did not originate from Heaven. And even if one says the entire Torah originated from Heaven except for this verse, i.e., any one verse, claiming that the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not say it but Moses himself said it on his own, this is included in the category of: “Because he has despised the word of the Lord.” And even if one says the entire Torah originated from Heaven except for this inference inferred by the Sages, or except for this a fortiori inference, or except for this verbal analogy, this is included in the category of: “Because he has <strong>despised</strong> the word of the Lord.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the violation here is not idolatry, it seems that it became the basis of the mitzvah of loving G-d is described in (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.418?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer haChinuch Mitzvah 418</a>) (translation of R. Charles Wengrow):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The substance of the precept is that <strong>we should consider and reflect on His commandments and His handiwork</strong>, until we attain a concept of Him according to our ability, and we can then feel joy in appreciating Him, with the utmost delight.  This is obligatory, an essential love.</p>\n<p>The language of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.33.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Sifrei Devarim 33</a>: While it is stated <em>and you shall love</em>, <strong>I do not know how a man is to love the omnipresent G-d</strong>. Hence, Scripture states, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:6</a> <em>And these matters which I command you today shall be on your heart</em>. For as a result of this you will \"recognize\" the One who spoke and the world came into existence. In other words, with reflection-understanding in the Torah, the love [of G-d] settles perforce in the heart. And the Sages of blessed memory said, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.32.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim 32</a> that this love should impel a man to arouse people about love for Him - as we find in the instance of Abraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We believe that G-d commands and teaches entire Torah to us every day, as we formulate blessings on the Torah in the present tense. Placing on the heart the commandments is a component of love as stated in Sifrei above, so that violation of commandments is the opposite.</p>\n<p>Thus, we have to conclude that fulfilling the mitzvah of loving G-d is contingent on contemplating and fulfilling of ALL commandments, including the multiple prohibitions of idolatry, and <em>not the other way around</em>. Through the Torah, with persistence and time, one gains a conception or appreciation of the Creator who gave the Torah, His immanence and influence in this world; and this must inevitably inculcate love of Him. Since only after fulfiling many commandments one can attain a level of loving G-d, it becomes clear why the mitzvah is placed at the end of the Torah and not at the very beginning.</p>\n<p>As a side note, the Mitzvah to fear G-d <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.432.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer haChinuch Mitzva 432</a>, refers to fear of punishment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is very important to keep in mind that G-d is entirely above the concept of emotions. Use of emotional terms in reference to G-d are no different than use of physical terms in reference to G-d; that is, they are metaphorical terms. The term Kinah refers to someone insisting on his rights.</p>\n<p>As the creator, G-d has the right to insist we worship Him and no false gods. This is independent of and prior to the commandment to love G-d. It is only once you accept the uniqueness of G-d that it makes sense not to worship false idols. If one does not accept the uniqueness of G-d, then those idols might actually have power, ch\"v, and there would be no cause for jealousy if one worshiped them. This is why in the Shma (Deuteronomy 6:4-5), the commandment to love G-d comes after the commandment to recognize G-d as one, which parallels the negative commandment of worshiping false idols. (Maimonides Foundations of the Torah ch.1, 6-7)</p>\n<p>All this being said, it is definitely true that loving G-d will prevent a person from worshiping idols. This is seen in the case where a false prophet encourages people to worship idols. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.13.4?ven=Metsudah_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=en&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of a dream, because Adonoy, your God, is testing you to know <strong>whether you love Adonoy, your God, wholeheartedly and with your entire beings</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There is, however, something I can't see clearly yet: Priests (Aaron's sons) would indeed enter the Court and the Holy Place, but would other Levites also enter the Holy Place?</p>\n<p>(Of course, not in the Holy of Holies, for that would be only once a year, only the High Priest, and therefore a son of Aaron.)</p>\n<p>Numbers 18:4 made it more complex, for it says that Levites were to \"keep the charge of the Tent of Meeting, whatsoever the service of the Tent may be,\" and the following passages don't help either. Especially verse 7, where it states \"thou [Aaron] and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertaineth to the altar, and to that <strong>within the veil</strong>,\" this <strong>veil</strong> is the veil of the Holy of Holies, suggesting that the \"other\" Levites could also work inside the Holy Place, and not only the outer court.</p>\n<p>Other passages, such as Numbers chapter 4, suggest that Levites wouldn't enter the Holy Place etc.</p>\n<p>So: Levites could enter the Holy Place or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Levites were considered Israel in regards to entering the Court of Kohanim, as Mishnayot in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.1.8?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keilim 1.8-9</a> state: <em>'Ezras Kohanim - The Court of the Priests (1) is holier, for Israelites may not enter it except when they are required to do so: for laying on of the hands, slaying or waving.</em> The areas beyond the Altar had further restrictions and even some kohanim could not enter there, certainly ulam and the Holy.</p>\n<p>The Cortyard of the Mishkan (2) was smaller, but had the same restrictions as the inner Court the Temple had later.</p>\n<p>In the desert, the entrance to Mishkan was restricted to Aharon and his sons. Moshe could also enter to receive prophecy inside the Ohel Moed - Tent of the Meeting (Holy of Holies). However, we can also see that technically, G-d could call anybody inside the Tent of the Meeting, as we see in the story of Miriam and Aharon in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.4?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 12:4</a> (Miriam was a wife of Calev - a member of the tribe of Yehuda).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Middot.2.6?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Middos 2:6</a>, in the Temple Courtyard Leviim had a special chamber underneath 'Ezras Israel where they kept their instruments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) the area between the gates of Nikanor and the outer altar was divided into 2 parts: Court of Israel and Court of the Priests.

Each person can utilize whatever picture is more beneficial to him. So we have a right to think those thoughts, but we should know that these thoughts are only forms meant to help us gain an awareness of Hashem. Actually, Hashem is far above any form that you can ever imagine. אין לו דמות הגוף ואינו גוף. So, therefore, both things are true. We have the right to picture Hashem in order to gain more awareness of Him, and nevertheless, we know that Hashem is exalted above all forms that we could ever imagine.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know the source of this concept that we have 'permission' to imagine Hashem with a face during davening?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you are inserting your own personal interpretation on the Rabbis wording.</p>\n<p>The rabbi is saying that we must imagine saying our Tefilot the same way we would beg for something from a Dignitary or King, or from a wise man who holds all the answers. He is (by דרך המשל) trying to anthropomorphize the Tefilot to be relatable, much like the posuk says Moshe spoke to Hashem like one would speak to his friend.</p>\n<p>As to imagining Hashem Yitborach with some sort of image, see Rabbeinu Saadia Gaon’s pirush on Hazon Daniyel. Even if the rabbi meant to literally imagine some sort of resemblance of God, this can be tied to understanding Daniyel HaNovi’s vision of Hashem siting on his throne, that both Hashem and the Throne are not actually physically being seen as they are both far beyond anything physical or even spiritual. The throne of God is to be understood as the Emanated Glory of God’s power in the lower worlds</p>\n<p>So rather it is to be understood as imagining Hashems great power that he reveals to us everyday and moment להודיע לבני אדם גבורותיו וכבוד הדר מלכותו</p>\n\n\n",

Originally, the term seems to have been part of the phrase \"ובלילה ציר\"ו\", which explains the connection to the verse (see e.g. the text that Benayahu discussed there; for more examples, search Otzar Hachochmah for the word ציר\"ו).</p>\n<p>As @N.T. suggested in a comment, the Chida's usage of the term within the phrase \"ויהי ציר\"ו\" may have been based on the verse in Melachim 1:5:12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיְדַבֵּר שְׁלֹשֶׁת אֲלָפִים מָשָׁל <strong>וַיְהִי שִׁירוֹ</strong> חֲמִשָּׁה וָאָלֶף\"<br />\nHe composed three thousand proverbs, and <strong>his songs</strong> numbered one thousand and five.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same phrase was also used later by Rabbi Yosef Chaim [A]buchbut<sup>1</sup> in a eulogy he wrote for a woman named Rachel Asudari (can be found in the book Me'oraot Yosef, p. 178).</p>\n<p>It should be noted that many made-up words or Jewish transliterations of foreign words are written in Medieval and Modern-era sources with apostrophes or quotation marks, as well as on occasion also \"real\" words.<sup>2</sup> Sephardic rabbis in particular also used this form to denote words whose original meaning changed in a particular context (e.g. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=226&st=&pgnum=29&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בְּעַרֶ\"ב היא באה</a>, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Esther.2.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בָּעֶרֶב הִיא בָאָה</a>).<sup>3</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Both spellings exist.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> For a short note on this phenomenon, see <a href=\"https://hebrew-academy.org.il/wp-content/uploads/%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A0%D7%95-%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%96%D7%95%D7%A8-33-%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%A1-3-%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%92-%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%91_.newocr-31-32.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> [Hebrew].</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> I heard this example from <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Yaron Harel</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

And through the iron furnace, those who had\njoined the House of Jacob in earlier times, who were gathered together\nbut not yet at the right time, were brought back and judged in a\nsimilar manner. First by the decree of the Nile and the dispersal to\nmake bricks, as we will mention further. However, during the Flood and\nthe Dispersion, their embers were extinguished without repentance. But\nhere, Pharaoh offered them up to their Father in Heaven. And those who\nwere there and were not worthy of redemption died through repentance\nand crying out, which are effective even to the point of utter\nsoul-crushing. Likewise, during the days of darkness, many of the\nsinners died, but it is written, 'For all the children of Israel,\nthere was light in their dwellings.' And the abundance here indicates\nthat even those unworthy of redemption, since they died through\nrepentance as we said, had light in their dwellings in the Garden of\nEden, and none were missing. Or it can be interpreted that in their\ndwellings, those worthy of settling and being redeemed had light, and\nthese are the six hundred thousand that God brought close to Mount\nSinai. Then, He saw and waived for everyone else the seven general\ncommandments, and specified thirty, as it is stated in the chapter of\nGid HaNasheh (the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve), and these\nare they:\"</p>\n<p>(Note: The translation maintains the interpretive and allegorical\nnature of the original text, which may refer to Kabbalistic or\nMidrashic traditions.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next part is translated by ChatGPT as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"First, idolatry and associated practices: passing children through\nfire, sorcery, divination, magic, enchanting, consulting mediums,\nnecromancy, and seeking the dead. According to Rabbi Yose, who said\nthat all those mentioned in the portion about sorcery are prohibited\nto the descendants of Noah. Thus, there are ten commandments.</p>\n<p>Second, forbidden sexual relations, and associated with it: being\nfruitful once and multiplying twice as a positive commandment, the\nprohibition of sodomy even if they make a formal marriage contract,\nthe prohibition of hybrid animals, castration, and grafting\ntrees—these are seven, as explained further.</p>\n<p>Third, murder, and striking the face of an Israelite is associated\nwith it, so there are two.</p>\n<p>Fourth, blasphemy, and respect for the Torah is associated with it, as\nwell as the obligation to engage in the Torah given to them (the\nNoahides), because a Noahide who engages in it is like a High\nPriest—thus, there are three.</p>\n<p>Fifth, theft, and not engaging in Torah that is our inheritance is\nassociated with it, so there are two.</p>\n<p>Sixth, the establishment of courts for the settlement of the world,\nand not allowing them to cease is associated with it, so there are\ntwo.</p>\n<p>Seventh, the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal, and\nassociated with it: the prohibition of blood from a living animal,\ncarcasses, and the flesh of the dead—thus, there are four.</p>\n<p>In total, there are thirty. Even though 'be fruitful and multiply' is\none commandment for us, and among the 613 commandments, it might seem\ndifficult to understand why it is divided into two here. This is\nbecause we do not derive the law for the descendants of Noah from the\nTorah of Moses our teacher. Alternatively, 'be fruitful and multiply'\nis always counted as one for both us and them. The commandment of\nestablishing courts is divided into two, one as a positive commandment\nand one as a negative commandment, as is explained in the Talmud.\nRashi explained it as follows: one is to judge fairly, and the other\nis to avoid injustice.</p>\n<p>The sacrifices for the early generations were like one who is not\ncommanded but does them regardless. This seems to me to support all\nthe words of the sages. All of these were repeated in the chapter on\nthe four modes of execution, except for three, which are found in the\nchapter on the sciatic nerve. This matter is in accordance with all\nthe Tannaim and Amoraim, where one sage said one thing, and another\nsaid another, but they do not disagree.\"</p>\n<p>And these three that we mentioned refer to the prohibitions against\nsodomy, human flesh, and the respect for the Torah. There is also the\nprohibition against the meat of a carcass, which is clearly taught in\nthe Pesikta from the verse: 'Every creature that is alive' (Genesis\n9:3), excluding a carcass, meaning an animal that died of itself. This\nis not in accordance with the words of Tosafot in the chapter 'Four\nModes of Execution,' where they said that in such a case, it was\npermitted to the first human (Adam) based on the verse 'You may surely\neat' (Genesis 2:16), and not 'limb from a living animal,' which\neveryone agrees was not permitted. However, it was not allowed to kill\nan animal, wild beast, or bird for the sake of eating meat. It is\nimplied that it was permitted to kill for medical purposes or to\nbenefit from their hides, and later, eating their meat was also\npermitted.</p>\n<p>As for the statement about 'seeing and permitting,' do not infer from\nthis that it would be allowed for us to cause another person to sin.\nFor it was taught explicitly: a person should not hand a limb from a\nliving animal to a Noahide, and the Torah specifically stated, 'You\nshall throw it to the dog' (Exodus 22:30). Rather, it was permitted to\nthem (the Noahides), but they will eventually be held accountable as\nthose who have sinned repeatedly. This is discussed in chapter 14.\nAlternatively, it was permitted to them, but even if they fulfill\nthose commandments, they do not receive reward like those who are\ncommanded to do so, but rather like those who perform a commandment\nvoluntarily, for there are no longer rejected souls for whom it was\noriginally thought that they should not be left without Torah even for\na single moment.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And it is written elsewhere: “Fathers shall not die for their children, and children shall not be put to death for the fathers; every man shall die for his own transgression” (Deuteronomy 24:16) ... This is not difficult. This [verse from Exodus, which states that God punishes descendants for the transgressions of their ancestors, refers to a case] where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own. While this [verse from Deuteronomy, which states that descendants are not punished for the actions of their ancestors, refers to a case] where they do not adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So one could argue that Ezekiel too is referring only to cases where the descendants do not adopt the wicked ways of their ancestors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Makkot.24a.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Makkot 24a</a> seems to view the two verses as directly contradicting each other, and posits that Ezekiel indeed revoked what Moses had originally said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: Moses our teacher issued four decrees upon the Jewish people, and four prophets came and revoked them ...

I will summarise at the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And note that when man sleeps, his faculties rest and his emotions are\nquiet; and his intellect also rests and is quiet. <strong>Only his imagination\nis active and goes and imagines and creates content according to what\ncomes to it from the remnant of what he depicts during the time he is\nawake and from what comes to it from the vapors and gases that go up\nto his brain - whether from the natural humors or whether from foods.</strong>\nAnd this is the matter of everyone's dreams. But the Creator, may He\nbe blessed, also embedded into it that the higher spirit that we\nmentioned slightly remove itself at this time from its physical\nconnections at this time. So portions of itself - down to the essence\n- arise and separate from the body. And only one part - which is the spirit - remains with the lower spirit. <strong>And behold, the separated\nportions float, according to what is allowed them, and encounter and\ninteract with spiritual entities - whether with supervisors of nature\nor with angels of prophetic reception or with demons, according to\nwhat comes to it from one of the various causes. And sometimes the\ncontent that it grasps is drawn down and unfolds to the lower spirit,\nsuch that an image is aroused and creates content according to its\nways.</strong> Yet it is possible that the content that it grasps be true or\nfalse, due to the intermediaries through which it grasped it. And this\ncontent itself is drawn down to the imagination: Sometimes it is\nconceived of with great confusion, and much jumbling with the empty\nimages that are drawn from the vapors; though sometimes it is with\ngreat clarity. And even information and foreknowledge about what will\nhappen to a man in the future can reach him in these ways. <strong>And this\nhappens according to His decree, may He be blessed, such that He\ninforms the soul through one of His servants of any given type, and\nthe content gets to the spirit in its imagination - either obscurely\nor clearly, based on what is decreed by the Supreme Wisdom</strong>. And about\nthis matter is it stated (Job 33:15-16) , \"In a vision of a dream at\nnight, etc... He then open s the ear of people.\" It comes out that\ndreams of imaginative content are either from [the imagination] itself\nor from that which is aroused by the soul according to that which it\ngrasps. However in all [of the latter], the action is only from one of\nthe spiritual forces that informs the soul. <strong>Then the soul brings it\ndown to the imagination</strong>, as we have written. And if the force is from\nthe holy servants, the thing will be true; whereas if it is from the\nopposite forces, the matter will be false. And this is what is written\n(Berakhot 55b), \"Here it was through an angel, but there it was\nthrough a demon.\" But all of them contain some mixture of empty images\nthat are only from the imagination. And that is what is written\n(Berakhot 55a), \"It is impossible for a dream to be without idle\nthings.\" However there are other dreams that exist, and they are\nprophetic dreams. [Translation by Rabbi Francis Nataf]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Human beings have a faculty called \"imagination\" in their intellect (as part of their soul, and this is connected with the Limbic system in the brain), and it is able to form the imagery we see in dreams, including the characters in those dreams.</p>\n<p>Another point is that portions of our soul leave our bodies when we sleep and interact with spiritual forces. While we do not experience this consciously, or remember it, it can lead to influence that passes down our soul links until it reaches the part of the soul that never left the body, and then into the imagination.</p>\n<p>This is all dependant on Hashem's decree. If He wants a true or false matter to be transmitted to a persons' dreams, He arranges that this should happen. This can include information about the future.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it doesn't seem this sort of experience will necessarily lead to the actual spiritual forces themselves featuring in our dreams, or any other entities. Ultimately it is still taking place in the imagination, either clearly or obscurely, and the characters in our dreams are still conjured up, even if they are images of real people and real events.</p>\n\n\n",

My question is: Is that Talmud censored?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Codex_Hebraica_95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> says it is not censored and that it is a faithful copy with everything in it, no censorship. I have a PDF copy... But wanted to make sure I had a Talmud Bavli without any alteration; just as it was meant to be. Sorry if this question is disrespectful, but I'm an agnostic, not a Christian, and have taken a keen interest in Jewish things.<br />\nThank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yes, the Munich 95 manuscript is censored, but not in a matter as exhaustive as some later manuscripts. For a list of Jesus-related censored and uncensored passages in the Munich manuscript and several other manuscripts, see Peter Schäfer, <em>Jesus in the Talmud</em>, pp. 131-144 (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/jesus-in-the-talmud_202301/page/131/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>).

Consider also googling the words \"Munich 95\" and \"censor\" or \"censorship\" for more discussions on the matter.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the comments, unfortunately we don't possess any Talmudic manuscript that hasn't ever been altered. We don't have the original Talmud copy. Rabbis, Talmud scholars, and historians spend years trying to unravel millennia of variant traditions, textual evolution and scribal errors to try and recreate the original text and decipher the original meaning of the Jewish sages (I myself have attempted that with regards to one particular passage in Bavli Shabbat, and I'm well aware that though IMO it's well-argued, it's just a hypothesis).</p>\n<p>I can refer you to some studies on the textual tradition of particular tractates, though I believe most of these are in Hebrew.</p>\n\n\n",

I.e., We do not accept their repentance and do not see them as falling under the category of penitents, but, rather, continue to see them as the sectarians they were, and assume that the righteousness of their behavior is motivated by fear or a desire to fool people. But the second text states that if they truthfully repented in all that concerns their relationship with their Creator, they have a share in the world to come. This [second] law concerns their relationship with their Creator, while the first concerns their relationship with other human beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would seem from this that though these kings would have to be treated by their fellow Jews <em>as if</em> they were not Jewish, if they repented they would in fact continue to be Jews. However, it stands to reason that until such time as they repent, both in the view of Heaven and Man they would be viewed as as Non-Jew.</p>\n\n\n",

Apparently hard to get hold of now and going for silly prices. Agree the everburninglight website looks disreputable.

They are certainly no worse the the old Sonico translation of Zohar we relied on before Pritzker edition was available i.e. no academic footnotes or explanations but readable enough and better than nothing if you don't read Aramaic. Cordovero was young when he wrote Pardes and although he had a sharp mind he had little ontological humility and comes across a bit pedantic and quick to criticise other kabbalists apart from Rashb'y and select heros, but he was very genuine and insightful. It's a useful compendium of speculative kabbalah up to when Luria changed everything. If you can get hold of copies without spending a fortune then recommended.</p>\n\n\n",

It is based vaguely on the Talmudic exegesis of the Biblical commandment (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.14.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Yevamot.13b.17&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 13b on Deuteronomy.14.1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אֲמַר לֵיהּ רֵישׁ לָקִישׁ לְרַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: אִיקְּרִי כָּאן ״לֹא תִתְגּוֹדְדוּ״, לֹא תֵּעָשׂוּ אֲגוּדּוֹת אֲגוּדּוֹת\"\n\"Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: I should read here the verse: “You shall not cut yourselves [titgodedu]” (Deuteronomy 14:1), which is interpreted as meaning: Do not become numerous factions [agudot]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my understanding, this term is more descriptive than Halachic - it describes a person who does not participate physically or emotionally with the community and doesn't share their distress and misery (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HaOrah%2C_Part_I.71?vhe=Lviv,_1905&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Sefer HaOrah</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בזמן שהציבור בצער לא יאמר אדם אלך לביתי אוכל ואשתה ושלום עליך נפשי והפורש מן הצבור שני מלאכי השרת המלווין לו לאדם מניחים ידיהם על ראשו, ואומרים לו פלוני שפירש מן הציבור אל יראה בנחמת ציבור:\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, when a local rabbi declares a fund rising for Pidyon Svuyim (release of Jewish hostages) or a public prayer or fasting for rain or any other purpose, and a person does not take part in either.</p>\n<p>This term appears in Geonic (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sheiltot_d%27Rav_Achai_Gaon.163?vhe=Sheiltot_d%27Rav_Achai_Gaon%3B_Vilna,_1861&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sheiltot_d'Rav_Achai_Gaon</a>) and later responsa. Here's Rashi's response to a woman who asked to fast Ta'anis Ester on a different day than her community because of personal difficulties (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Teshuvot_Rashi.128.1?vhe=Teshuvot_Rashi_vol._I,_New_York,_1943&lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%AA%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%95%D7%93%D7%93%D7%95&with=Lexicon&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvot_Rashi.128.1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"מעשה שהיה ואירע פורים באחד בשבת וקדמו להתענות בחמישי בשבת וכן עמא דבר: ובאתה אשה אחת לפני ר' שהיה לה לרכוב אחר השלטונה. ושאלה אם איפשר שתתענה למחר ותאכל היום מפני טורח הדרך. ואמר ר' אעפ\"י שאין [זה] תענית ציבור קבוע, לא מדברי תורה ולא מדברי סופרים, אלא שנהגו העם כן... קבלו עליהם היהודים פורים זכר לניסים:<br />\n<strong>מכל מקום אסור לו לאדם להיות פורש מן הציבור, כדאמרי' בפ\"ק דיבמות לא תתגודדו, לא תעשו מצות אגודות אגודות</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This term can be used to apply various disciplinary, or financial sanctions toward that person.</p>\n\n\n",

Why did the Gemara give this parable, which in reality is apparently not true? Why did the Gemara exaggerate the parable and not reflect the reality?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The quoted Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.20a.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 20a</a> states regarding the reed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲחִיָּה הַשִּׁילוֹנִי קִלְּלָן בְּקָנֶה, אָמַר לָהֶם לְיִשְׂרָאֵל: ״וְהִכָּה ה׳ אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל כַּאֲשֶׁר יָנוּד הַקָּנֶה״, מָה קָנֶה זֶה עוֹמֵד בִּמְקוֹם מַיִם, וְגִזְעוֹ מַחְלִיף וְשׇׁרָשָׁיו מְרוּבִּין, וַאֲפִילּוּ כׇּל הָרוּחוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם בָּאוֹת וְנוֹשְׁבוֹת בּוֹ — אֵין מְזִיזוֹת אוֹתוֹ מִמְּקוֹמוֹ, אֶלָּא הוֹלֵךְ וּבָא עִמָּהֶן. דָּמְמוּ הָרוּחוֹת — עָמַד הַקָּנֶה בִּמְקוֹמוֹ.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan elaborates: Ahijah the Shilonite cursed the Jewish people by comparing them to a reed: “For the Lord will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water.” Although it seems to be a curse, this verse is actually a blessing. Just as this reed stands in a place of water, and its shoots replenish themselves when cut, and its roots are numerous for a plant of its size, and even if all the winds in the world come and blow against it, they cannot move it from its place, rather, it sways with them until the winds subside, and the reed still stands in its place, the same applies to the Jewish people. After all the difficulties that they endure, they will ultimately survive and return home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the cedar tree gemara continues</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲבָל בִּלְעָם הָרָשָׁע בֵּירְכָן בְּאֶרֶז, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״כָּאֲרָזִים עֲלֵי מָיִם״, מָה אֶרֶז זֶה אֵינוֹ עוֹמֵד בִּמְקוֹם מַיִם, וְאֵין גִּזְעוֹ מַחְלִיף, וְאֵין שׇׁרָשָׁיו מְרוּבִּין. אֲפִילּוּ כׇּל הָרוּחוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם נוֹשְׁבוֹת בּוֹ — אֵין מְזִיזוֹת אוֹתוֹ מִמְּקוֹמוֹ. כֵּיוָן שֶׁנָּשְׁבָה בּוֹ רוּחַ דְּרוֹמִית — עוֹקַרְתּוֹ וְהוֹפַכְתּוֹ עַל פָּנָיו. וְלֹא עוֹד אֶלָּא שֶׁזָּכָה קָנֶה לִיטּוֹל הֵימֶנּוּ קוּלְמוֹס לִכְתּוֹב בּוֹ סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה נְבִיאִים וּכְתוּבִים.</p>\n<p>However, Balaam the wicked blessed the Jews by comparing them to a cedar, as it is stated: “<em>As cedars beside the waters</em>” (Numbers 24:6). Just as this <em>cedar does not stand in a place of water</em>, and its shoots do not replenish themselves, and its roots are not numerous, Balaam wished that the same should apply to the Jewish people. Furthermore, while it is true that even if all the winds in the world blow against it they will not move it from its place, once the southern wind blows against it, it uproots the cedar and turns it on its face. And not only that, but the reed merited that a quill [kulmos] is taken from it to write with it a Torah scroll, the Prophets, and the Writings. <em>Evidently, the curse comparing Israel to a reed is better than the blessing likening them to a cedar.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The simple understanding of the story</strong> is that the reed naturally grows in water which usually protects a reed from all winds. The winds may cut the reed stems, but do not uproot it, since the roots are hidden under water; so that the plant regrows itself. Cedar trees mostly grow in Lebanon mountains, where the trees are protected from the heat of the southern wind from the Negev desert. Cedar trees do not grow near water as implied by Bil'am, because the tree roots need air, and the soil saturated with water does not have enough air for the roots. Such a tree will not develop well.</p>\n<p>There are several symbolic comparisons that come to mind for reed and cedar. <strong>The simplest is comparison by size</strong>: a lowly reed against a tall cedar, i.e. humility vs. pride as it is done by Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 14:4</a>: <em>This lofty tree was used because plagues come also as a punishment for haughtiness (cf. Arakhin 16a).</em> Also Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.19.22?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 19:22</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עץ ארז ואזוב ושני תולעת CEDAR WOOD AND HYSSOP AND CRIMSON — These three species correspond to the three thousand men who fell by the edge of the sword on account of the golden calf. The cedar is the loftiest of all trees and the hyssop the lowliest of all — a symbol that the man of high position who displays pride and on that account falls into sin should make himself as lowly as the hyssop and the worm (תולעת), and he will then gain atonement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The second comparison</strong> comes from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 3:17</a> where Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוּא הָיָה אוֹמֵר, כָּל שֶׁחָכְמָתוֹ מְרֻבָּה מִמַּעֲשָׂיו, לְמַה הוּא דוֹמֶה, לְאִילָן שֶׁעֲנָפָיו מְרֻבִּין וְשָׁרָשָׁיו מֻעָטִין, וְהָרוּחַ בָּאָה וְעוֹקַרְתּוֹ וְהוֹפַכְתּוֹ עַל פָּנָיו, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ירמיה יז) וְהָיָה כְּעַרְעָר בָּעֲרָבָה וְלֹא יִרְאֶה כִּי יָבוֹא טוֹב וְשָׁכַן חֲרֵרִים בַּמִּדְבָּר אֶרֶץ מְלֵחָה וְלֹא תֵשֵׁב.\nאֲבָל כָּל שֶׁמַּעֲשָׂיו מְרֻבִּין מֵחָכְמָתוֹ, לְמַה הוּא דוֹמֶה, לְאִילָן שֶׁעֲנָפָיו מֻעָטִין וְשָׁרָשָׁיו מְרֻבִּין, שֶׁאֲפִלּוּ כָל הָרוּחוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם בָּאוֹת וְנוֹשְׁבוֹת בּוֹ אֵין מְזִיזִין אוֹתוֹ מִמְּקוֹמוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שם) וְהָיָה כְּעֵץ שָׁתוּל עַל מַיִם וְעַל יוּבַל יְשַׁלַּח שָׁרָשָׁיו וְלֹא יִרְאֶה כִּי יָבֹא חֹם, וְהָיָה עָלֵהוּ רַעֲנָן, וּבִשְׁנַת בַּצֹּרֶת לֹא יִדְאָג, וְלֹא יָמִישׁ מֵעֲשׂוֹת פֶּרִי:</p>\n<p>He used to say: one whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, to what may he be compared? To a tree whose branches are numerous but whose roots are few, so that when the wind comes, it uproots it and overturns it, as it is said, “He shall be like a bush in the desert, which does not sense the coming of good. It is set in the scorched places of the wilderness, in a barren land without inhabitant” (Jeremiah 17:6).\nBut one whose deeds exceed his wisdom, to what may he be compared?\nTo a tree whose branches are few but roots are many, so that <strong>even if all the winds in the world come and blow upon it, they cannot move it out of its place</strong>, as it is said, “He shall be like a tree planted by waters, sending forth its roots by a stream. It does not sense the coming of heat, its leaves are ever fresh. It has no care in a year of drought; it does not cease to yield fruit” (Yirmiyahu, 17:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The third comparison</strong> is that the merit of the Torah study even in exile is greater than the merit of the Beis haMikdash which was made out of cedar wood as discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136841/how-can-we-use-cedar-wood-for-the-beis-hamikdosh/143721#143721\">here</a>. Water is reference to Torah as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.82a.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 82a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּתַנְיָא: ״וַיֵּלְכוּ שְׁלֹשֶׁת יָמִים בַּמִּדְבָּר וְלֹא מָצְאוּ מָיִם״ – דּוֹרְשֵׁי רְשׁוּמוֹת אָמְרוּ: אֵין מַיִם אֶלָּא תּוֹרָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״הוֹי כׇּל צָמֵא לְכוּ לַמַּיִם״.</p>\n<p>As it is taught in a baraita with regard to the verse: “And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water” (Exodus 15:22). Those who interpret verses metaphorically said that water here is referring to nothing other than Torah, as it is stated metaphorically, concerning those who desire wisdom: “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water” (Isaiah 55:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The southern wind is a reference to the valley of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehenna\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Hinom</a>, which was in the south-west, where the during the First Temple people made child sacrifices. As we also know, the south-west corner of the altar belonged to the territory of Shevet Yehudah, and from that part the fire and the destruction went to the whole of the Temple.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>the Torah study provides greater protection than a cedar tree</em> for a messenger of the Angel of Death as one can learn from Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.10a.13?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 10a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאִי בָּעֵית אֵימָא, מַאי קוֹלְטִין – מִמַּלְאַךְ הַמָּוֶת. כִּי הָא דְּרַב חִסְדָּא הֲוָה יָתֵיב וְגָרֵיס בְּבֵי רַב, וְלָא הֲוָה קָא יָכֵיל שְׁלִיחָא [דְּמַלְאֲכָא דְּמוֹתָא] לְמִיקְרַב לְגַבֵּיהּ, דְּלָא הֲוָה שָׁתֵיק פּוּמֵּיהּ מִגִּירְסָא, סְלֵיק וִיתֵיב אַאַרְזָא דְּבֵי רַב, פְּקַע אַרְזָא וּשְׁתֵיק, וִיכֵיל לֵיהּ.</p>\n<p>And if you wish, say: What is the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that matters of Torah provide refuge? It means protection, but not for an unintentional murderer from the blood redeemer; rather, it means protection from the Angel of Death. This is as it was in this incident where Rav Ḥisda was sitting and studying in the study hall of Rav and the agent of the Angel of Death was unable to approach him and take his life because his mouth was not silent from his study for even a moment. The agent ascended and sat on the cedar tree of the study hall of Rav. <strong>The cedar tree broke</strong> and Rav Ḥisda was momentarily silent, startled by the sudden noise, and the agent of the Angel of Death overcame him. Apparently, matters of Torah provide protection from the Angel of Death only when one is actively engaged in their study.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Please <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.13.23?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">check your translation carefully</a>. The narrator keeps telling us it's an angel. Then Samson's father (who doesn't seem to be the most astute) says <em>we will die because we saw Elohim.</em> The mother responds: \"if <em>G-d</em> (<em>Adonai</em>) wanted to kill us, He wouldn't have shown us all of this.\" That means God showed the parents something by sending them an angel. Similarly it doesn't say \"He wouldn't have told us this\", but rather \"He wouldn't have <em>made us hear</em> [Heb. <em>hishmi-anu</em>] all of this.\" Again, this means God sent an angel.</p>\n<p>Okay so what's Manoah talking about?

I am copying the full sugia for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁחַמְתִּית וְנִמְצֵאת לְבָנָה כּוּ׳. אָמַר רַב פָּפָּא: מִדְּקָתָנֵי ״לְבָנָה״, שְׁמַע מִינַּהּ הַאי שִׁמְשָׁא סוּמַּקְתִּי הִיא. תֵּדַע, דְּקָא סָמְקָא צַפְרָא וּפַנְיָא. וְהַאי דְּלָא קָא חָזֵינַן כּוּלֵּיהּ יוֹמָא – נְהוֹרִין הוּא דְּלָא בָּרִי.</p>\n<p>§ The mishna teaches that if the seller said that he was selling reddish-brown [sheḥamtit] wheat and it is found to be white, both the seller and the buyer can renege on the sale. The Gemara assumes that sheḥamtit means the color of the sun [ḥama]. Therefore, Rav Pappa said: From the fact that the mishna teaches: White, in contrast to sheḥamtit, and there are two types of wheat, one white and the other red, conclude from the mishna that this sun is red, not white. Know that this is the case, as it reddens in the morning and evening. And the reason that we do not see the red color all day is because our eyesight is not strong and we cannot discern the redness of the sun.</p>\n<p>מֵיתִיבִי: ״וּמַרְאֵהוּ עָמֹק מִן הָעוֹר״ – כְּמַרְאֵה חַמָּה עֲמוּקָּה מִן הַצֵּל. וְהָתָם לָבָן הוּא! כְּמַרְאֵה חַמָּה – וְלֹא כְּמַרְאֵה חַמָּה; כְּמַרְאֵה חַמָּה – דַּעֲמוּקָּה מִן הַצֵּל, וְלֹא כְּמַרְאֵה חַמָּה – דְּאִילּוּ הָתָם לָבָן, וְהָכָא אָדוֹם.</p>\n<p>The Gemara raises an objection to this claim: With regard to a verse that speaks of leprosy: “And, behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin” (Leviticus 13:30), the Sages explain: This means that it is like the appearance of the sun, which is deeper than the shadow. But there, leprosy is white and yet it is likened to the sun. The Gemara answers: There, it means that it has an appearance like the sun in certain respects, but it is not like the appearance of the sun in all respects. It is like the appearance of the sun in that it is deeper than the shadow, and it is not entirely like the appearance of the sun, as there the leprous spot is white, and here the sun is red.</p>\n<p>וּלְמַאי דִּסְלֵיק דַּעְתִּין מֵעִיקָּרָא – הָא קָא סָמְקָא צַפְרָא וּפַנְיָא! בְּצַפְרָא – דְּחָלְפָא אַבֵּי וַורְדֵי דְּגַן עֵדֶן, בְּפַנְיָא – דְּחָלְפָא אַפִּתְחָא דְגֵיהִנָּם. וְאִיכָּא דְּאָמְרִי אִיפְּכָא.</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: And according to that which entered our mind initially, that the sun is white, doesn’t it redden in the morning and evening? The Gemara answers: <strong>In the morning it becomes red as it passes over the site of the roses of the Garden of Eden, whose reflections give the light a red hue. In the evening the sun turns red because it passes over the entrance of Gehenna, whose fires redden the light.</strong> And there are those who say the opposite in explaining why the sun is red in the morning and the evening, <em>i.e., in the morning it passes over the entrance of Gehenna, while in the evening it passes over the site of the roses of the Garden of Eden.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last italicized line is incorrect in Sefaria (i.e. Koren / Steinsaltz). Because it states in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.8?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 2:8</a> that Gan Eden is in the east. The Artscroll translates this very last point like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.84a.7?lang=bi&with=Rashbam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> that rays get reflected accordingly and not like Sefaria above: i.e. in the morning the Sun is in the east and shines west and its rays fall at the entrance of Gehenum in the west, so that the Sun gets reddish from the strength of (redness of the entrance of) Gehenum. The opposite in the evening when the Sun is in the west and its rays shine east and fall on Gan Eden and the Sun gets reddish from the strength of redness of the roses at the entrance of Gan Eden.</p>\n\n\n",

The Satmar Rav says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for someone leaving the Land of Israel to go to outside lands, it\nis considered as if they are serving foreign gods. However, this is\nnot the case when holiness is present in the foreign rule, as was the\ncase during Joseph's time in Egypt. On the contrary, during the time\nof the Canaanites, they served foreign rulers. At that time, Yosef\nwas placed over Egypt, and his rule was sanctified. The verse states,\n'G-d has made me a ruler of all Egypt.' Thus, the rule in Egypt was\nconsidered holy, according to the promise given: 'Do not be afraid to\ngo down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this context, the greatness of the nation is attributed to their\nmerit in studying the Torah, as stated: 'Who is like the great\nnation?' Israel is called a great nation because they upheld the Torah\nand its commandments. <strong>As our sages said, in Egypt, Israel continued to\nstudy Torah, and even Yehudah was engaged in Torah study.</strong> It is also\nmentioned that a Yeshiva (a place of Torah study) was established in\nEgypt, and Amram, the elder, sat there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.28?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi (Bereishis 46:28)</a> that the words \"להורת לפניו – Lehoros Lefanav\" mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפניו BEFORE HIM — means before he should arrive there. A Midrashic\ncomment is: להורת לפניו (in the sense of, “that there might be\nteaching before him”) — to establish for him a House of Study from\nwhich Teaching (הוראה or תורה) might go forth (Genesis Rabbah 95:3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But.... The navi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.20.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel (20:8, see Rashi there)</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me: they did not cast away every man the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Miżrayim: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Miżrayim.</p>\n<p>But they rebelled against Me They are the wicked, the majority of\nIsrael, who died in the three days of darkness, as it is said (Exod.\n13:18): “and the children of Israel went out of Egypt,\n(חֲמֻשִּׁים)”one out of fifty, and some say, one out of five hundred.\n(Rashi)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know from different source (Daas Zkenim) that since the Torah did not cease from shevet Levi, they were not enslaved (שלא פסקה מהם תורה כלל ולפיכך לא נשתעבדו במצרים), but this applies only to Shevet Levi.</p>\n<p><strong>So, how to reconcile this with what the Satmar Rav says? Are there any other sources that discuss the Torah-environment in Mitzrayim other than Shevet Levi?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer to your question maybe is similar to R. Yom-Tov Schwarz' explaination regarding the generation of Bayis Sheini, which I quoted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105724/what-caused-jerusalem-to-be-destroyed/144672#144672\">the discussion why Jerusalem got destroyed</a>. According to him, Hashem ensures that the merits of those who observe the commandments and study Torah completely balance the misdeeds of those who have fallen off the <em>derekh</em>. In other words there were two groups of Jews in every <em>shevet</em>: those who kept <em>emunah</em> and acted with <em>bitachon</em> vs. those who did not. The problem might arise only when those who keep the <em>mitzvos</em> make them blemished, like we had senseless hatred during <em>Bayis Sheini</em>.</p>\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Beshalach.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash Tanchuma Beshalach 1</a> partially quoted by Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the children of Israel went up armed (Exod. 13:18). This suggests that only one out of five (<em>hamishah</em>) went up armed (<em>hamushim</em>). However, others say: Only one out of fifty (<em>hamishim</em>) went up, while still others insist that only one out of every five hundred (<em>mihamesh</em>) went up. R. Nehorai declared: By the Temple service! Not even one out of five thousand went up. When had the others died? During the days of darkness, they would bring their dead for burial while the Egyptians sat in darkness. The Israelites praised Him and thanked Him (for the fact) that their enemies were unable to see their misfortune and take satisfaction in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The midrash can be viewed as exactly proving the point of R. Yom-Tov Schwarz. It does not mean the <em>p'shat</em> that 80% of Jews died in Mitzraim, for entire Mitzraim in those days did not have over 10-15 mln people including the Jews. The midrash is talking about percentages of the Jews who had the intent to serve Hashem at different levels <em>lishma</em>. For example, the fraction 1/5,000 for a count of 600,000 signifies 10 people per <em>shevet</em> who were really learned and were full <em>tzadikim</em>, while the fraction 1/5 signifies 10,000 people per shevet, who just accepted the concept of leaving Mitzraim to serve Hashem.</p>\n<p>As a side note, when reading your question some people may ask: we know that Mitzrayim was a center of witchcraft and idol worship, even if run by Yosef, why was it necessary for Jews to go there? It turns out from the studies by archaeologists, the <em>mitzrim</em> were extremely serious about their religion. It was this kind of attitude that Hashem wanted the Jewish people to have when performing  the mitzvos. However, this matter is tangential to your question.</p>\n<p>Finally, in regards to the fact that Bnei Yehuda learned Torah in Mitzraim, we have a pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.2.6?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei haYamim A 2:6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבְנֵ֣י זֶ֗רַח זִ֠מְרִ֠י וְאֵיתָ֧ן וְהֵימָ֛ן וְכַלְכֹּ֥ל וָדָ֖רַע כֻּלָּ֥ם חֲמִשָּֽׁה׃</p>\n<p>The sons of Zerah (ben Yehuda): Zimri, Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Dara, five in all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Evidently these five sons lived in Mitzraim. Rashi explains futher:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara They all lived at the time of David and at the time of Solomon, and they were exceedingly wise. Concerning this it says (I Kings 5:11): “And he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol.” Further on, regarding Solomon’s wisdom, the expression is “Darda,” for even though it was called the generation of knowledge (דֵּעָה דּוּר) because of its wisdom, Solomon was wiser than all of them. Now when Scripture says הָאֶזְרָחִי, the “aleph” is superfluous, like הַזַּרְחִי (Num. 26:20), [because] he was descended from Zerah, and in many places, the “aleph” is inserted into the word, and is not pronounced, e.g. (Job. 13:17): “and my speech (וְאַחְוָתִי)” (Isa. 19:6): “And they shall abandon (וְהֶאֶזְנִיחוּ).” And likewise, (Num. 11:4): “וְְהָאסַפְסוּף, and the rabble.” Now sometimes it is completely missing, as (II Sam. 19:14): “תֹמְרוּ, you shall say,” and likewise, (II Chron. 22:5): “... and the Arameans (הָרַמִּים) smote.” [The verse in Kings] is expounded by Pesikta (Peskikta d’Rav Kahana p. 34, Pesikta Rabbathi 14:9): “... than all men this refers to Adam. Ethan is Abraham. Heman is Moses. Calcol is Joseph. Darda is the generation of the desert. Mahol means that He forgave them for making the Calf.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One might think that they were descendands of Zerach. However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.14.12?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabba 14</a> teaches regarding the summary of the offerings of <em>Nesiim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Five rams” (Numbers 7:17) – <em>it corresponds to the five mighty ones of the world</em>, and they are: “The sons of Zeraḥ: Zimri, Eitan, Heiman, Kalkol, and Dara; all of them were five” (I Chronicles 2:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, this is the example of great Torah scholars from Mitzraim, since the Nesiim brought offerings beginning on the 1st of Nissan, one year after Exodus, when people could not have learned the Torah well unless they had a tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

In his speech, in addition to stories and complaints, he introduces 200 (!) additional Mitzvos, despite the aforementioned ending verse in Numbers.</p>\n<p>I can't wrap my mind around this fact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If those Mitzvos were already known to all, why weren't they all included in the previous books, for example, the multiple Mitzvos learned from שמע ישראל?</li>\n<li>If they were not known and heard for the first time, why aren't they prefaced with \"וידבר ה' למשה לאמר\" or something similar to reflect their divinity and not Moses' addition? Alternatively, can we say that the Torah has changed to reflect the characteristics of the new generation, for example, the Mitzva to love God with all your heart?</li>\n<li>If they were known only to Moses, why didn't he relay them to his generation? Didn't they put Teffilin or recite Shemah?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I will use <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/what-is-sefer-devarim-part-2-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Chaim Jachter's comments on Sefer Devarim</a> with added sources.</p>\n<p>Moshe Rabbeinu delivered the speeches in Sefer Devarim, who wrote the speeches?  Using example of the curses in parashas Ki Savo, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.31b.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilla 31b</a> implies that Moshe Rabbeinu composed Sefer Devarim. For example, Rashi clarifies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moshe spoke [the words] from the Mouth of the Might and was made into a messanger \"Holy One Blessed be He said to me so\", therefore [in Parashas Bechukosai it says]: \"I will place, I will make you pay, I will send\" - the One who is capable to do so. However, in the Mishneh Torah it is written \"Hashem will hit, Hashem will attach to you\". Moshe said [these words] on his own if the [Jewish people] transgress the commandments, Hashem will make them pay for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.31b.8?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot (ad. loc.)</a> clarify that Moshe Rabbeinu wrote it with <em>Ru’ach HaKodesh</em>, divine inspiration.  This means that Hashem influenced Moshe Rabbeinu in his composition of the speeches.  However, Tosafot does not state that Moshe Rabbeinu wrote Devarim with <em>Nevu’ah</em>, prophecy.  Moshe Rabbeinu did have input into the speech.  While it is difficult, if not impossible, to know where Hashem’s influence ended and Moshe Rabbeinu’s autonomy began, the Gemara clearly states that Moshe Rabbeinu had at least a measure of independence in the composition of the speeches recorded in Sefer Devarim.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Moshe Rabbeinu certainly did not devise the Mitzvot that appear for the first time in Sefer Devarim.  Instead, <em>what Moshe Rabbeinu is doing is presenting Mitzvot which he heard from Hashem at Har Sinai but until now were simply Torah SheBe’al Peh</em> as noted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Exodus.34.32.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 34:32 with Chizkuni</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>all the commandments that G-d had spoken to him about while he had been on Mount Sinai on his first and third stay on the Mountain, as well as all the commandments that He had communicated to him from Nissan when they had left Egypt until the twentieth of Iyar in the second year when they broke camp around the Mountain. However, according to the Talmud in tractate Gittin folio 60, the written Torah, i.e. in scroll form, he wrote down personally, one parchment at a time. When Moses made ready to leave this earth, he arranged these parchments in the order in which we read them nowadays according to the order he considered appropriate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also the introductions of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Deuteronomy%2C_Introduction.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> to Sefer Devarim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, he (Moshe) proclaims commandments which have not been [previously] mentioned at all, such as the levirate marriage, the law concerning the defamation of a virgin bride, the divorcing of a wife, [the punishment of] plotting witnesses, and others besides. Now all these laws had in fact been declared to Moses, either on Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting within the first year [of the erection of the Tabernacle] before the affair of the spies. Nothing new was revealed to Moses in the plains of Moab [where he held this review of the Torah] except the words of the covenant, as is expressly stated there. It is for this reason that this book does not contain such statements as “And G-d spoke to Moses, saying:Command the children of Israel,” or “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them the following commandment” [since no new commandments were given in this book; they had all been previously declared to Moses either on Mount Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting]. These commandments, however, were not written in the preceding books wherein He speaks to those that came forth from Egypt. Perhaps this was because these commandments were obligatory only in the Land even though they affect personal conduct [and do not depend on the Land] such as Scripture mentions with reference to the drink-offerings; or it may be that because these were not of common occurrence, he mentioned them only to the generation, the inheritors of the Land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, R. Jachter notes that in Sefer Shemot (20:14), Hashem commands us <em>not to be jealous of our neighbor’s wife, his ox and donkey, and all that belongs to his neighbor</em>.  However, in Sefer Devarim Moshe Rabbeinu formulates (according to the Pashtanim such as Ibn Ezra) the prohibition as forbidding jealousy of <em>one’s neighbor’s wife, house, field, ox, and anything he has</em>. in the Midbar we did not have homes and we did not have fields.  Now that we in Sefer Devarim are about to enter Eretz Yisrael the concern for jealousy of one’s neighbor’s house and field becomes very relevant.</p>\n<p>The subject is discussed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abarbanel_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy%2C_Introduction?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> to in his introduction to Sefer Devarim. Abarbanel clarifies that Hashem is the author of Sefer Devarim since Hashem is quoting Moshe Rabbeinu with His approval and even possibly edits his speeches for inclusion in the Torah (as for example, discussed <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.4.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Abarbanel fits beautifully with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.4.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 15b</a> that teaches that Hashem cites the original Torah thoughts of the great Chachamim.  While Hashem undoubtedly influences the Chachamim (see Mishna, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.4.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yadayim 4:3</a>), they also have some degree of autonomy.  Hashem cites the great Chachamim with approval just as He approvingly presents Moshe Rabbeinu’s speeches in Sefer Devarim.</p>\n\n\n",

So, presumably, all generations must have known to attribute their sorrows to their ancestors' misdeeds.</p>\n<p>The Book of Job contrasts different explanations for Job's suffering (surprisingly nobody reveals to him the true cause which was merely a bet between God and Satan): Divine Testing, Retributive Justice, Mystery of Suffering, and God's Sovereignty.</p>\n<p>We observe that Job attempts to atone for the possible sins of his children by bringing sacrifices, implying that he's aware of some intergenerational influence.</p>\n<p>However, nobody in the book suggests that he may simply pay for his forebears being idolaters which is more than reasonable.</p>\n<p>Why is this option not on the table?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.7?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a Rabbeinu Bachaya</a> that explains how the \"visiting the punishment on the children to the third and fourth generation\" is actually known as a \"midda rachamim\" - one of Hashem's 13 attributes of mercy. Therefore, we need to understand what is merciful about it, because it comes across as justice (and at first glance, might even seem <em>unjust, chas veshalom</em>)</p>\n<p>So, the explanation is this. A person who sins and deserves to be cut off is not cut off. Instead, Hashem exercises patience and mercy, and allows his children to atone for him. If his children continue to sin, Hashem still doesn't cut off the family line, but waits another generation, perhaps up to four. This can only go on so long, and eventually if there is no sign of teshuva from this branch, it will be cut off.</p>\n<p>So, we can see, this act of mercy isn't about getting transferred punishments from our ancestors. Rather, it is that we are influenced by their ways, and we get a chance to do teshuva for the whole branch by overcoming these ways (and perhaps even tested by Hashem as part of the rectification process - true teshuva, as Rambam teaches, is achieved when we are tested again and pass, and perhaps this is part of what is being \"visited\" upon the children).</p>\n<p>Job was a Tzaddik, and therefore, he had already \"started fresh\". Any sins of his ancestors will have been atoned for by him, and therefore he doesn't need to be tested for their sake. This story is actually about the righteous suffering, rather than sinners suffering.</p>\n\n\n",

Meir had a certain way of teaching the mishnayos (1) to his disciples; and Rebbe (R. Yehudah ha Nassi) chose and established this way (2) to teach [the mishnayos] to everyone. R. Meir had received his way of learning [the Mishna] from his teacher, R. Akiva; and R. Akiva had received it from his teachers, the earlier sages. This we say (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.86a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 86a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Yochanan said: \" An anonymous Mishna is R. Meir.

And all of them follow the method of R. Akiva, for all of them were disciples of R. Akiva.\"</p>\n<p>Rebbe, Rabbeinu haKadosh, R. Yehuda haNassi  - he was well versed in all existing halachic presentations, Rebbi mastered 13 approaches to the laws (Nedarim 41a) as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143814/36610\">discussed here</a>; he also can be considered a student of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143818/36610\">many rabbis</a>. It was his choice to use approach of Rabbi Meir, because he found it the most suitable for a kind of a code that Mishna is supposed to be: fairly generic, yet detailed enough. Says gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.13b.3?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 13b</a> in praise of R. Meir:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the topic of Rabbi Meir and his Torah study, the Gemara cites an additional statement. Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that <strong>in the generation of Rabbi Meir there was no one of the Sages who is his equal</strong>. Why then didn’t the Sages establish the halakha in accordance with his opinion? It is because his colleagues were unable to ascertain the profundity of his opinion. He was so brilliant that he could present a cogent argument for any position, even if it was not consistent with the prevalent halakha. As he would state with regard to a ritually impure item that it is pure, and display justification for that ruling, and likewise he would state with regard to a ritually pure item that it is impure, and display justification for that ruling. The Sages were unable to distinguish between the statements that were halakha and those that were not.</p>\n<p>It was taught in a baraita: Rabbi Meir was not his name; rather, Rabbi Nehorai was his name. And why was he called by the name Rabbi Meir? It was because he illuminates [meir] the eyes of the Sages in matters of the halakha. And Rabbi Nehorai was not the name of the tanna known by that name; rather, Rabbi Neḥemya was his name, and some say: Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh was his name. And why was he called by the name Rabbi Nehorai? It is because he enlightens [manhir] the eyes of the Sages in matters of the halakha.</p>\n<p>The Gemara relates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: The fact that I am more incisive than my colleagues is due to the fact that I saw Rabbi Meir from behind, i.e., I sat behind him when I was his student. Had I seen him from the front, I would be even more incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see your teacher” (Isaiah 30:20). Seeing the face of one’s teacher increases one’s understanding and sharpens one’s mind.</p>\n<p>And the Gemara stated that Rabbi Abbahu said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Meir had a disciple, and his name was Sumakhus, who would state with regard to each and every matter of ritual impurity forty-eight reasons in support of the ruling of impurity, and with regard to each and every matter of ritual purity forty-eight reasons in support of the ruling of purity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) Each Tanna had his own style and order of teaching the mishnayos.</p>\n<p>(2) R. Meir was his teacher (Eruvin 13b, Yebamos 93a). This point was discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143818/36610\">here</a> in the comments that R.

The person isn't impressed by right or wrong enough. Sometimes its because they have pleasures and desires they don't want to deny, or because they've rationalised it, or are cognitively dissonant. This  includes not caring enough about the reward or punishment. Things can be worse too - not caring about Hashem or others, <em>chas veshalom</em>.</p>\n<p>All are made worse by repetition and addiction. All are made worse by the numbing of the person's soul overall that happens through sin.</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Manis Friedman says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOLYmQ6qF1k\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this shiur</a>, we weren't born yesterday. Is it right? Is it wrong? Does it matter? We know that <strong>it's forbidden</strong>, and we know that that's the truth, whether we are motivated or not. And yes, we know it's wrong too.</p>\n<p>So, to work on that, study some Torah, a little or a lot but as much as one can:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפילו לא שנה אדם אלא פרק אחד שחרית ופרק אחד ערבית קיים לא ימוש.</p>\n<p>Even if a person studies only one chapter in the morning and one\nchapter in the evening, he fulfills the commandment of 'this Torah\nshall not depart from your mouth.' (Menachot 99b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with prayer for success: it's got all the information we need to help us connect back reality, and Hashem will help us, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.5.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">even if all we can open is the eye of a needle</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תּוֹרַת ה' תְּמִימָה, מְשִׁיבַת נָפֶשׁ.</p>\n<p>The Torah of Hashem is perfect, and restores the soul (Tehillim 19:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would just add from personal experience: even if someone does already learn Torah, and has never been particularly affected by it, don't give up. It can years, or even decades. Sometimes a person learns for decades, and then one day stumbles upon just the right thing that speaks to his soul, shines a new light on all the learning that came before, connecting dots, and ends up affecting real, permanent change. It's guaranteed, but the timeframe is up to Hashem. <strong>Don't ever give up or lose hope!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Moshe answers the big, eternal question of life: \"what does Hashem want\", in the pasuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And now, Israel, what does Hashem your God ask of you, but to fear Hashem your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, and to serve Hashem your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\" (Devarim 10:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7920/jewish/Chapter-41.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Tanya explains</a> the first step: fearing Him. Chapter 41 paraphrased (heard this paraphrase from Rabbi Roni Fine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone is in the room with us, we usually are ashamed to sin or be improper. This means we fear them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and thus fearing Hashem is staying in touch with reality. It's a starting point, and the beginning of the ladder for the rest - following in His ways, doing it for Him (and our fellow Jews) with love will also come from this study.</p>\n<p>These things that Moshe asks of us are explained in the chapters of Perishut, Tahara, Chassidut and Yirat Chet of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim?tab=contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesilat Yisharim</a>, rather than the first 3 chapters. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/61092/jewish/Title-Page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya teaches</a> that everyone can apply these lessons, and do all this for some and eventually all the Mitzvot - every Jew. It's \"not across the ocean\" but \"very close to our heart and mouth to do it\" (Devarim 30:13-14).</p>\n<p>Learning this doesn't change one over night, but it does change one eventually, the Torah guarantees anyone can do proper Teshuva:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And you will return to Hashem your God and obey His voice... And\nHashem your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you.\n(Devarim 30:2-3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנינן, לית מלה בעלמא דקיימא קמי תשובה</p>\n<p>It is taught: nothing in the world stands in the way of Teshuva (Zohar, Saba d’Mishpatim, 106a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Levi said: These are children of those who have nine traits, who are defective from their conception and from whom rebels and transgressors emerge. The mnemonic for these nine traits is children of the acronym aleph, samekh, nun, tav, mem, shin, gimmel, ayin, ḥet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The children of nine traits are as follows... <strong>children of ostracism [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herem_(censure)#Niddui\" rel=\"noreferrer\">niddui</a>], i.e., one of the parents was ostracized by the court</strong>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This translation of \"בני נידוי\" (as referring to children who were conceived when a parent was under <em>niddui</em> excommunication) follows the view of a number of rishonim (Rashi ad loc., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Nedarim.20b.9.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">s.v \"בני נידוי\"</a>; Rambam, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.21.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Mishneh Torah</em>, Hil.

And there are those who explain that it refers to when either he or she is in <em>niddui</em> excommunication when they are forbidden to engage in marital relations, and the same law applies when one of them is in mourning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <em>Beiur Halacha</em> (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%9E#%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">240, s.v. \"בני נידוי\"</a>) the Chafetz Chaim cites both opinions, and actually presents the interpretation of excommunication first:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בני נידוי:    היינו כשהוא או היא היו אז בנידויים וה\"ה כשהוא או היא היו באבלם... ויש גורסין בני נדה דאף דאין הולד ממזר מזה פגום מיהא הוי ועליהם אמר הכתוב וברותי מכם וגו' [פמ\"ג]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other authorities, as mentioned, have grappled with how to approach this issue from the standpoint of couples who wish to get married, when one of them was born from parents who were not particular to observe the laws of <em>nidda</em>. R' Moshe Feinstein (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=921&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Igros Moshe</em> EH IV, 14</a>), for instance, says we can infer from someone's good character that the mother likely immersed herself in a body of water that constitutes a valid <em>mikva</em> (like the ocean) before her child was conceived, even if the mother's intention wasn't to observe the laws of <em>nidda</em>.</p>\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim, when referring to \"all the waters in the world\", merely meant that showering is insufficient and that immersion in a valid body of water would be required (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.201.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan 'Aruch</em> YD 201:1</a>). As such, he would not necessarily object to R' Moshe Feinstein's reasoning.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How much does a ma'ah cost in £/$ in today's world?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To work out the exchange rate between the mishnayos/gemoroh money and nowadays to make the numbers more realistic.</p>\n<p>EDIT 13.9.2024\nto answer a few questions:\nI meant in terms of purchasing power but i guess you could use silver value to get to there.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>According to the table of coins in the \"<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/practical-talmud-dictionaryhardcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Practical Talmudic Dictionary</a>\" by R. Yitzchak Frank, מעה/Ma'ah is a silver coin weighing about 0.7 gram / 0.02251 oz (early opinion per Double AA), and <em>more precisely 0.58 gram / 0.02046 oz</em> (16 medium barley seeds). I will use the US dollar value of silver for comparison. Obviously market prices can vary from country to country.</p>\n<p>Silver is a very soft metal. Due to high purity of the presently minted silver coins, they are sold in plastic casing for protection. Old silver coins were harder and obviously they did not have the same purity. The present cost of 0.999% pure silver bar is $31.31 USD per 1 oz. Therefore, the 0.90 pure silver should be about $28.75 USD per 1 oz (one needs to add the cost of additional weight) so that 1 ma'ah comes down to about $0.65 USD (old opinion) or <em>$0.60 (more precisely)</em>.</p>\n<p>As far as purchasing power, evidently, market prices changed all the time even in the times of Gemara. In <em>masekhes</em> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.57a.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 57a</a> there is an example that 1 (silver) dinar could purchase 40 modios of grain, or 1 seah. The currently accepted volume of 1 seah is either 8.29 liter (R. Chaim Noeh) or 14.4 liter (Chazon Ish). It follows, that 1 ma'ah, which is 1/6 of a dinar, could be used to purchase 1.38 liter - 2.4 liter of wheat.</p>\n<p>The comparison to current prices may not be meaningful because the agricultural commodities became cheaper due to advances in technology. The current price of wheat is about $6.1074 per bushel which is 36.368 liter or $0.167933 per 1 liter. Thus, we see that the wheat equivalent of 1 ma'ah would cost $0.23 - $0.403 today.</p>\n<p>Production of silver also became much cheeper. R. Baruch Epstein in Torah Temimah (published in 1902) on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Temimah_on_Torah%2C_Exodus.22.6.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 22:6</a> (comment עט) notes: that in his days the silver for two ma'ah was equivalent to 10 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopeck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kopecks</a> = 0.1 of the Russian Ruble. He says that in the time of gemara silver was much more expensive, and already in his time it was so cheap that one could not use it for oaths or marriage. Torah Temimah points to Tosafos in Menachos 107b, who notes this specific issue with the value of silver.</p>\n<p>One can take over-all value of money from comparing minimal savings which prevented a person from getting gifts to the poor at the time of Mishna and now. Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Peah.8.8?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peah 8:8</a> states that a person in posession of 200 dinar cannot get gifts to poor. There does not seem to be a similar statistics on personal savings that prevent receiving government support. However, at present, to get by in most states to meet basic needs one needs between $30,000 and $45,000 annually <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/income-a-single-person-needs-to-get-by-in-every-us-state.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">depending on a state</a>. Taking average of $37,000 as equivalent of 200 dinar, one gets about $31 per ma'ah. This value encapsulates all price reductions due to advances in technology.</p>\n<p>There is another example in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Chagigah.1.2?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Hagiga 1:2</a> (suggested by ProfJames - thank you) which gives the minimal value of a lamb for the 'Olah (R'iyah) and Shlamim (Chagiga) offerings as 1 ma'ah or 2 ma'ah. The <a href=\"https://www.sheepusa.org/resources-marketreports\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">feeder lamb current prices</a> (older than 9 days) are around $200-220 USD. In this case, advances in technology increased the value of domesticated animals by making them bigger. Based on the size of bones, as the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aQmfQ5H2vTg?si=Z8c5QuzkvhBaN1ct\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">video by Simcha Jacobovici</a> attests, at the time of Mishna animals were smaller.</p>\n<p>The market for old coins despite their lower silver purity is very different. Certainly, the antique value and the good condition of the rare coin could fetch a lot. Even not so antique, pre 1921 year 1oz Morgan silver dollar is sold for $49.95 USD compared to $28.20 value of its silver content.</p>\n\n\n",

Either to make note of the change of opinion or because it was already memorized, or perhaps הכל had another reason for being there (as the Gemara also states). However, you can see there is a specific <strong>authorship</strong> and <strong>system</strong> for authorship. <strong>Even before Rebbi it was memorized.</strong></p>\n<p>There are other examples of systemized authorship before Rebbi that Rebbi included in his unified version.

Presumably with a lot of overlap - but nevertheless distinct style/system of teaching the same Oral Law.</p>\n<p>If they had different actual laws, Rebbi would need to include them either way. They would exist as Baraisos or Toseftas but we don't see any hint of that.</p>\n<p>Also since they aren't individual Mishnas and rather called sets, meaning they were arranged and systemized; otherwise there would be an infinite and wouldn't be called a \"set\", rather it would be listed as number of Mishnayot on a topic - hopefully the above made sense.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this helps you in a way understanding that the Mishnayot were systematically authored for memorization, that they existed before Rebbi, and that Rebbi simply chose or crafted one system for everybody, lest you mix two different styles/systems for example. And so that Rebbi could include the agreed upon Halachic decisions until that time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One can start investigating the origin of the Midrash <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash_Eleh_Ezkerah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eleh Ezkerah</a>, which separately records the event of tragic execution of the 10 Jewish Sages, the major <em>tannaim</em>, by the Roman Imperial government.

The object of the Midrash is not only the description executions, but the fact that the Roman government expressed interest in Judaism and the Torah and the end result was erasing the names of the core Jewish Sages. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.56a.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Gittin 56a</a> records conversion of emperor Nero to Judaism, which is unconfirmed historically.

This was a moment where the the reformers of Jewish law (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saducees</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethusians\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Boethusians</a>, and others) split into two groups: one side sought rebellion against Rome headed by James (brother of Jesus) and the other side - Paul, who advocated peace with Romans.

The Roman documents also mention <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaphroditus_(freedman_of_Nero)#:%7E:text=Tiberius%20Claudius%20Epaphroditus%20or%20Epaphroditos%20%28Greek%3A%20%E1%BC%98%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%86%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82%3B%20born,by%20Domitian%20for%20failing%20to%20prevent%20Nero%27s%20suicide.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an official with such a name</a>. I will not speculate, whether or not Christianity was a project of the Roman government, while they certainly created new religious cults in every country that they occupied combining Roman and local deities. However, the reading verses of the Scripture in a way that is devoid of tradition (i.e. by cutting the chain of tradition via erasing the names of the core <em>tannaim</em>), by abolishing <em>mitzvos</em> and subplanting the <em>machshavah</em> with hellenist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">neoplatonic</a> philosophy certainly required that the text like the <em>Mishna</em> be developed.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the real question is why the Mishna has not been put to writing prior to those events. Jewish people, like many other nations during the same time shifted from prophetic solutions to more legalistic solutions of the disputs. As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143851/36610\">discussed here</a> in connection with development of the Mishna, Netziv in the introduction to the <em>Ha’amek Sh’alah to Sheiltos of Rav Hai Gaon</em> (translated as \"<em>The Path of Torah</em>\") explained that holiness of the Temple somehow allowed the Sanhedrin to arrive at the correct <em>psak</em> without systematically developing generic legal system. Thus, destruction of the Temple and development of Christianity are the real reasons for the need of development of the Mishna.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Torah service on shabbat with no kohanim and not enough yisraelim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If there are no kohanim in <em>shul</em> on <em>shabbat</em>, Ashkenazi practice is to give the first <em>aliyah</em> to a <em>levi</em> or <em>yisrael</em>, and the subsequent six <em>aliyot</em> to <em>yisraelim</em>. (See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 135:6,9,10.)</p>\n<p>What happens if there are no <em>kohanim</em> and five or fewer <em>yisraelim</em>, with the rest of the <em>minyan</em> made up of <em>leviim</em>? Presumably in these cases, one would give <em>aliyot</em> to more than one <em>levi</em>.</p>\n<p>How should the seven <em>aliyot</em> be distributed between the <em>leviim</em> and <em>yisraelim</em>?</p>\n<p>Ideally, answers should address the six cases ranging from zero <em>yisraelim</em> to five <em>yisraelim</em>, and specify which <em>aliyot</em> go to which type of person in each case.</p>\n<p>(I’m asking mainly about these specific scenarios in order to keep the question more manageable. Feel free to expand your answer to include other scenarios with one or more <em>kohanim</em>, some <em>leviim</em> and insufficient <em>yisraelim</em>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The regular rules for Aliyah positions are based on three rules: 1) kohen and levi read first if available to avoid fighting about who reads first (Gittin 59a), 2) a kohen should not read directly after a different kohen, nor levi after another levi, so as not to make people wonder if the first one was found to be invalid (Gittin 59b), 3) some say Rule 2 applies even if the two are not directly adjacent since the latter 5 aliyot are generally for Yisraelim some might come to question the validity of the latter kohen/levi (cf. Shulchan Aruch OC 135:10), and some say not to worry about this third rule if calling another Kohen-Levi-Yisrael triad (cf. Mishna Berura, ibid :37).</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 135:12) rules that if you're stuck then we allow breaking all those rules. Since Rule 3 is highly disputed, that'd be the first to go. Accordingly, it comes out that you basically <strong>do as close to a repeating Kohen-Levi-Yisrael as possible as many times as needed</strong> to fill out 7 people.</p>\n<p>There are two caveats to keep in mind. First, if the case is one with at least one Yisrael and no Levi, then the first triplet would be Kohen-Kohen-Yisrael like an ordinary situation of no Levi, but not subsequent triplets since those are arguably not actually necessary as triplets. Second, if there are only Kohanim and exactly one other, or only Leviyim and exactly one Yisrael, the Shulchan Aruch (:12) rules we flip the script and put the singleton first to avoid fighting and continue with repeating statuses from there.</p>\n<p>Example case of 2 Leviyim and 1 Yisrael: Kohen, Levi, Yisrael, Kohen, Levi, Kohen, Kohen.</p>\n<p>Example case of 0 Leviyim and 3 Yisraelim: Kohen, same Kohen, Yisrael, Kohen, Yisrael, Kohen, Yisrael.</p>\n<p>Example case of 0 Leviyim and 1 Yisrael: Yisrael, Kohen, Kohen, Kohen, Kohen, Kohen, Kohen.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Four Non-Kosher Animals With One Sign?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The popular subject in <em>kiruv</em> classes is discussion about non-kosher animals that have one non-kosher sign discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.11.4-7?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 11:4-7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following, however, of those that either chew the cud or have true hoofs, you shall not eat: the <strong>camel</strong>—although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is impure for you. The <strong>hyrax</strong> — although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is impure for you. The <strong>hare</strong> — although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is impure for you. And the <strong>swine</strong> — although it has true hoofs, with the hoofs cleft through, it does not chew the cud: it is impure for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lecturers in kiruv classes note that these are the only animals with one non-kosher sign. However the article by <a href=\"https://tuxeliana.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/there-are-only-4-non-kosher-animals-with-one-kosher-sign-untrue/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tuxeliana ~ Random thoughts about Judaism as of March 11, 2014</a> suggests that the assumption about the uniqueness of the four animals may be questioned.</p>\n<p>How can one address the problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Natan Slifkin wrote a book \"The Camel, the Hare, and the Hyrax\" where he studied the statements in the Torah, the Talmud and other Jewish sources. He gives the following <a href=\"https://www.rationalistjudaism.com/p/the-camel-hare-and-hyrax\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">summary</a> on his site:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Torah lists four animals that possess only one kosher sign.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Talmud, following its own principles of drawing additional meaning from words in the Torah, infers that the Torah’s list is exhaustive.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Elsewhere, the Talmud states that this topic argues for the Divine origins of the Torah, but the meaning of this is disputed:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Approach A: The simple reading of Rashi is that the argument refers to Moshe being familiar with the physiology of the four animals in the list.</p>\n<p>Approach B: Alternately, one can argue that it refers to Moshe knowing all the local animals that possess one kosher sign.</p>\n<p>Approach C: Tosafos explains that it refers to Moshe knowing about an animal called the <em>shesuah</em>, but this is a difficult explanation, as the simple reading of the verse does not indicate that the shesuah is a type of animal.</p>\n<p>Approach D: Beginning in the eighteenth century, it was claimed that the Talmud’s argument refers to the Torah saying that there are no other such animals in the entire world. This argument rests upon (a) the boldness of the claim and (b) the veracity of it (as per point 2 above).</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p>Making an argument from the boldness of the claim is fundamentally flawed, as <em>there is no claim in the Torah that there are only four animals in the world possessing one kosher sign</em>. Simply speaking, they are presented merely as examples from the region of the Land of Israel that were a particular dietary risk for the Jewish People. The idea that the list is specified as being exhaustive would only be accepted by someone with an a priori belief in the divine origins of the Talmud.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The lamoids and peccaries from South America also possess only one kosher sign. To posit that they are of the same min as camels and pigs (respectively) can only be done with a novel definition of min that grants a high degree of unspecified flexibility in categorizing new species under the Torah’s preexisting range of types. Accordingly, making an argument out of the exclusivity of the list is greatly weakened.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There is overwhelming evidence (discussed in chapters six and seven) that the <em>shafan</em> and <em>arneves</em> are the hyrax and the hare, and there are no alternative viable candidates. Positing the existence of extinct and unknown species is not viable in this case.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to all evidence, the hare does not bring up the cud. To resolve this problem, we must say that the term <em>ma’aleh gerah</em> is an idiom that refers to such phenomena as <em>ruminant-style chewing</em> or <em>cecotrophy</em>, and/or to invoke the concept that \"the Torah speaks as in the language of men.\" These approaches are viable, albeit somewhat difficult.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There are conflicting reports as to whether the hyrax regurgitates its food. Based on my own extensive observations of hyraxes, <em>it appears that they do sometimes regurgitate small amounts</em>. It is likely that the hyrax practices <em>merycism</em>, which can be defined as <em>ma’aleh gerah</em> without difficulty. If it does not practice merycism, then it can only be defined as ma’aleh gerah on the basis of its manner of chewing, probably requiring us to invoke the concept that “the Torah speaks as in the language of men.” As with the hare, these approaches are viable, albeit somewhat difficult.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Since we are forced to define characteristics such as merycism, ruminant-style chewing or cecotrophy as <em>ma’aleh gerah</em>, then there are still further types of animals that possess only one kosher sign, even with our novel flexible definition of <em>min</em>/type.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>These further examples of animals with one kosher sign raise a problem with the Talmud, which apparently claims that the Torah’s list is exhaustive. However, there are two approaches which explain the Talmud in a way that avoids this problem:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>• The Talmud is only making a statement about the exclusivity of the camel (due to it being the only ma’aleh gerah animal that is domesticated, or that lacks upper teeth, or that is a true ruminant); but the hare and hyrax may indeed share their characteristics with other animals. This only leaves the problem of the lamoids, which can perhaps be rated as a type of camel, albeit with some difficulty.</p>\n<p>• The Talmud is only giving a rule for the general region surrounding the Land of Israel, but there may indeed be other such animals in remote regions of the world. This fits well with how various other seemingly universal rules in the Talmud are explained by other authorities - including Chazal themselves! - as only referring to local animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book discusses other animals that fall under such wider classification.</p>\n<p>The animals practicing <em>cecotrophy</em>: some types of rats, pikas, lemurs, coypu / nutrias, coalas (during one stage of their development), ringtail possums, capybaras, some of which obviously can be rejected as examples of <em>sheretz</em>.</p>\n<p>The animals practicing <em>merycism</em>: cangaroos, koalas.</p>\n<p>Among the additional animals with split hooves, which don't chew cud, the book also rejects the case of hippopotamuses, and discusses tapirs, and babirusas and concludes that despite developed stomachs these animals do not chew cud.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While Slifkin's answer reflects the present day state of science and observation of animal world, studies in genetics show that the creation of animal kinds is rather fluid (Jeanson, \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1683440757\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Replacing Darwin</a>\"). Therefore, the rabbis in the Talmud could have been quoting the tradition from the Noach's Ark. For estimates, regarding the number of species in the Ark, one can read the articles by Jean Lightner and her collegues (<a href=\"https://answersresearchjournal.org/determining-the-ark-kinds/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Determining Ark Kinds</a>, <a href=\"https://answersresearchjournal.org/mammalian-ark-kinds/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mammalian Ark kinds</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

If I had to venture a guess, I would say that the difficulty in פרק כירה is the following.</p>\n<p>Here the \"hard\" emerges from the <strong>sheer number of halachic variables to contend with</strong> when heating food or preserving the food's heat on Shabbos. The following is not a completely exhaustive list but it includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type of heat source</strong>: eg. כירה, תנור, כופח, מוליאר, אנטיכי</li>\n<li><strong>State of heat source</strong>: whether גרופה וקטומה or not</li>\n<li><strong>Type of fuel used for the fire</strong>: eg. קש\\גבבא, גפת\\עצים</li>\n<li><strong>Activity</strong>: eg. שהייה, החזרה, הטמנה</li>\n<li><strong>Mindset during activity</strong>: eg. whether דעתו להחזיר or not</li>\n<li><strong>Type of food</strong>: eg. תבשיל, חמין</li>\n<li><strong>State of food</strong>: eg. raw, כמאכל בן דרוסאי, מבושל כל צורכו</li>\n<li><strong>Reaction of food to overcooking</strong>: מצטמק ויפה\\רע לו</li>\n<li><strong>Position of food in relation to oven</strong>: eg. inside, top, near</li>\n<li><strong>Reason איסור דרבנן generated</strong>: שמא יחתה, מחזי כמבשל</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This leads to a high number of potential cases and outcomes to remember and master.  And this is even before we delve into a myriad of halachic opinions about these cases emerging from differences among the Tannaim and how the Amoraim view each opinion of Tannaim and how the Rishonim view all of the above.

In the same way that Rashi (Bereishis 1:11) explains דשא as “vegetation” as a concept as opposed to individual “plants”, a hoard of men will be described as “man” (e.g. Shoftim 7:23 ויצעק איש ישראל - “the Israelite man rallied”.) In this case, “man” is merely identifying the species of which the mass is comprised.</p>\n<p>Some more examples: ומלאו את הארץ חלל - “they filled the earth with ‘corpse’” (Yechezkel 30:11)</p>\n<p>ולא ימיש מעשות פֶרי - “it does not cease to give fruit” (Yirmiyah 17:8)</p>\n<p>וסוס ורכב רב מאד - “and horse and chariot, a great many” (Yehoshua 11:4)</p>\n<p>The more difficult it is to distinguish the individual, the more natural this becomes.

Is there any reason given in our sources?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>To make the question more focussed:</strong> I have put in bold 5 names in the list of people who were extremely important teachers of Torah, in the specific sense that they came along and revolutionised the Torah landscape in a significant way, providing rich, timeless and unique material that became important foundations.</p>\n<p>For example, <strong>King Shlomo</strong> wrote some of the most significant works in <em>Ketuvim</em>, because he was the wisest man to ever live. the <strong>Ramak's</strong> Pardes and other works were extremely and uniquely significant in ironing out long standing <em>machlokeses</em> in Kabbalah; the <strong>Arizal's</strong> Torah produced unmatched clarification of Kabbalah, and many <em>schools</em>; the <strong>Ramchal</strong> wrote key works that are essential to our understanding of <em>hashkafa</em> across the board; <strong>Rebbe Nachman</strong> produced a whole movement - a very significant one - and nobody came after him to replace him. The <strong>Ohr Hachaim</strong> was described by the Ba'al Shem Tov as the Moshiach of his generation and has remained one of the most respected and awesome Rabbis, since his untimely passing.</p>\n<p>In all of these cases, had these people been alive for another 20, 30 or 40 years, the impact that would have had on Torah and Judaism would have been unimaginably significant! It produces, I feel, a really understandable <em>kasha</em> in one's heart, moreso than the vast majority of other Rabbis, who lived long or died young.</p>\n<p>This is <em>why</em> I am asking, and <strong>the kind of answer I would accept would be one that directly addresses why one of these 5 specifically, or why we have several examples of <em>particularly significant and impactful</em> Rabbis dying young.</strong> For example, a source that says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Arizal had to die young, because had he lived any longer, he would have completely revealed the entire Torah and the Moshiach would have been forced to come</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Arizal's job was to come and reveal his wisdom to R' Vital, and then return so that R' Vital could continue the teachings in his own form to his students</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(this is purely speculative; made-up examples to help illustrate the kind of answer I am looking for.

If not Joshua, who is the prophet described in Deut. 18:18?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The prophet who immediately succeeded Moses as leader was Joshua, and this bestowal of leadership begins in <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0427.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 27:15-23</a>. As you mentioned, we indeed see the Almighty speak prophetically to Joshua in <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0601.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua 1:1-9</a>, and He was with Joshua as He was with Moses (<a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0603.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:7</a>).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the context of Deuteronomy 18 indicates that it is not only about Joshua, but about a series of true prophets who would continue to guide the Children of Israel throughout many future generations. As such, the singular word \"נביא\" (prophet) is referring to a template for a class of true prophets. Likewise, 18:19-22 speaks in a parallel manner of a template of false prophets who must be rejected, and the singular \"נביא\" is used even though such false prophets arose in multiple later generations (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a22.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 22</a> and <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1128.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 28:10-17</a>).</p>\n<p>As you mentioned, Moses had a <em>sui generis</em> type of prophecy (\"face to face\") that would never be achieved by anyone else (Deut. 34:10-12). Various commentators have addressed the meaning of \"like you\" in <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0518.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 18:15,18</a>, and some of them point out explicitly that the similarity of this prophet to Moses does not extend to the advanced level of prophecy that Moses achieved.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Targum Yerushalmi (Deut. 18:15, \"דְּדָמֵי לִי בְּרוּחַ קוּדְשָׁא\") explains the similarity to be that the future prophets will be infused with a prophetic spirit of holiness.</p>\n<p>Rashi (ad loc., \"כמו שאני מקרבך מאחיך יקים לך תחתי וכן מנביא לנביא\") explains the point of similarity to be that future prophets will be like Moses insofar as they will emerge from the brethren within the Children of Israel. Thus, Rashi reads the verse as, \"A prophet who will be from your midst, from your brethren, [and as such will be] like me.\"</p>\n<p>Rashbam (ad loc.) explains that the prophet will be like Moses in exhorting the Children of Israel to follow the Torah, unlike a false prophet or dreamer who tells Israel to worship idolatry. The Rashbam adds that Deut. 34:10 should be interpreted to read, \"And no other prophet arose in Israel like Moses, [insofar as] he knew the Lord face to face,\" while prophets would arise who would be similar to Moses in other respects.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra (ad loc., \"כמוני שהוא נביא השם לא מנחש\") provides a similar explanation that future true prophets would be prophets of the Almighty, and not sorcerous diviners.</p>\n<p>The Ramban (ad loc., \"וכן על דעתי 'כמוני' שיהיה נאמן לנביא לה' ותאמין בו כאשר אתה מאמין בי\") provides a similar explanation, that the true prophets would be similar to Moses insofar as being a faithful prophet of the Almighty, and that the Children of Israel should trust in such a prophet just as they trusted in Moses.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaye (ad loc.) explains that the prophet described in Deut. 18:15,18 is Joshua, but can also include the series of later prophets who would guide Israel. Rabbeinu Bechaye provides an explanation of \"like me\" which is similar to Rashi's explanation, and Rabbeinu Bechaye explains that the repeated language is necessary to drive home the point that future prophets for Israel would not merely emerge from distant \"brethren\" (namely the descendants of Esau or Ishmael), but only from the Children of Israel themselves.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaye also provides another explanation similar to the Rashbam, that future true prophets would never seek to permanently or completely uproot any of the commandments of the Torah, and at most they would have the authority to temporarily suspend observance of a commandment in some cases for certain exigencies (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.90b.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Y'vamos</em> 90b</a>).</p>\n<p>Finally, Rabbeinu Bechaye points out that the Children of Israel believed Moses not because of the miracles Moses performed, but rather because the entire congregation of Israel heard the Almighty's voice together with Moses and therefore knew that later pronouncements they would hear from Moses were from a true and reliable prophet. In a similar vein, the Children of Israel would establish future prophets not on the basis of miracles, but on the basis of verifying their prophecy and thereby establishing them as authentic prophets going forward (see Deut. 18:21-22).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>The New Testament passage to which you alluded (Acts 3:19-23) is a christological <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">eisegesis</a> that injects Christian interpretation into verses in the Hebrew Bible by ignoring the context of Deut. 18. </sub></p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch pointed out that the commandment was to destroy “the remembrance of Amalek”, not to kill Amalekites. [Hirsch on Deut. 25] Likewise, the Sfat Emet said that the commandment was to hate Amalek, not perform any action against them. [Shemot Zakhor 346] The Chafetz Chaim added that <em>God</em> will eliminate Amalek. Jews are only commanded to remember what Amalek did to them.  Rabbi Simcha Bunim pointed out that the Torah says to “blot out the memory of Amalek” (כִּֽי־מָחֹ֤ה אֶמְחֶה֙ אֶת־זֵ֣כֶר עֲמָלֵ֔ק מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָֽיִם׃) in the singular, not the plural. Not the Amalekites, but Amalek alone.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Rambam said that it is forbidden to declare war on anybody without first attempting to settle things peacefully.  The main condition is acceptance of the Seven Noahide laws.  [Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 6:1] This rule includes Amalek. Rabbi Yosef Karo, author of the Shulḥan Arukh, confirms: “If they do this, they are no longer Amalekites, but Noahides.”</p>\n<p>Others ruled that only a king or an organized community can perform the commandment, not an individual.

I am myself a grandson of survivors and the subject of the World War 2 as well as reserch related to Holocaust interests me greatly. In response to your questions, as I understand, there could be several ways to explain what happened. It was a combination of many bad odds against the Jewish people, that perhaps each one is worthy to learn from and seek alleviating that it will not happen.</p>\n<p>(a) Hatred of the Jewish people. Rabbi Eliezer Berkovitz discussed the subject in his book \"<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/faith-after-the-holocaust\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Faith after the Holocaust</a>\". He analyzes religious hatred instigated historically in Christian Europe as well more recent era ethnic hatred in secularized societies were the legal system is not G-d given which allowed such a grave crime to take place. In my opinion, his best idea is demonstration that a perpetrator of crime has stronger hatred towards the victim than the victim has towards the perpetrator of crime because the victim always stays a loud witness in the human court and the Heavenly court. One can view chosenness of Jews due to our survival as a sequence of generations recording history, as a perpetual witness. Thus, R. Berkovits' suggests that Holocaust was such an attempt to erase the witness of the past without thinking that one will nevertheless stand for trial in the Heavenly Court of Justice.</p>\n<p>(b) The internal Jewish answer as to why we got Holocaust. It has been also discussed in many ways, including the already mentioned book by R. Berkovits. Another book \"<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899064024.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoah</a>\" by Rabbi Yoel Schwartz and Rabbi Yitzchak Goldstein has a large section \"Why the Holocaust?\" - Searching for a Meaning presents several additional possible angles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Birth Pangs of Redemption (big disasters preceed great religious events)</li>\n<li>Search for Sins (lack of proper religious observance in years preceeding the war)</li>\n<li>Assimilation and decline</li>\n<li>Secular Zionism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not reasons but angles under which the causes of Holocaust could be discussed. We do not understand the Divine Justice. Especially Justice of such magnitude. We can only develop practical lessons for the life that we are given ahead of us. There are a number of other books and articles on the subject.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is important to note that Hitler's regime in Germany had a strong affinity to that of the Stalin's regime in the USSR. They celebrated the same holidays (like May 1st), had red color flags, and were leaders of \"workers movements\". The marxist ideology, by declaring ends justify means, has destroyed lives of hundreds of millions of people. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin_and_antisemitism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stalin also planned massive repressions against Jewish people in 1953</a>, but his death on the Jewish holiday Purim put an end to his evil plans.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The only cause of antisemitism is stated at the very beginning of the Torah, in the story of the patriarch Isaac, the first person born Jewish:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him. And the man became rich, and gained more and more, until he became very wealthy.  He had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and large numbers of servants. And the Philistines envied him.  And the Philistines stopped up all the wells which his father's servants had dug, in the days of Abraham his father, and filled them with earth. And Abimelech [king of the Philistines] said to Isaac, “Go away from us, because you are much mightier than we are.” And Isaac departed from there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. [Genesis 26:12-17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to summarize, Isaac lives peacefully among his neighbors, then, through hard and honest work, becomes fabulously wealthy and powerful.  So his neighbors hate him, harm him by depriving him of water, and finally expel him.</p>\n<p>The only reason for antisemitism is jealousy.  The envy of those who are perceived as more successful, more prosperous, more intelligent, God's chosen. Antisemites never acknowledge this reason because it makes them look bad, and Jews don't publicize it for fear of exacerbating antisemitism.  That’s why you don’t hear much about it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I arrived to this question trying to write mine.</p>\n<p>I would agree with your first question that since the Jewish people was chosen, it is a magnet for different quests and questions that sometimes end up in hatred.</p>\n<p>I, however, have a big problem with the second question, because I have heard already a few times, that Jews are kind of the scapegoat of the world. We, Jews, through our death, we atone for the sins of the non-Jewisch world. This is kind of too the vision which christians have of Jesus, who died for their sins. We have a similar principle that says that the death of the righteous atones for the people, but I think its obvious meaning relates only to the repentances inspired when the righteous die. People tend to feel  lonely, try their best etc. People repent.\nHowever, here you are saying that the Jews had to atone in some horrible way in order to be able to inherit the land of Israel in the eyes of non-Jews who allowed it. This is also not true because many Jews were already  in Palestine before the Shoah and maybe if it weren't for it, many others would have also moved and helped the Zionist initiative.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I want to say that the Shoah is so massive and incomprehensible that it screams \"such a thing can only happen to the Chosen people\". Its dimensions are of biblical proportion. This is also what happens in the Torah everytime G-d reveals himself through a miracle. Most of the miracles bring destruction whether in Egypt or in Sodom and Gomorrah, they are destructive. I do not know however if'd go so far away to say that the Shoah was kind of a negative miracle too. Yet, I would not call it an atonement / \"price\" for the Jewish people nor for the non-Jewish world necessary to enter the Land of Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

Michoel Miller, a scholar of Maharal, wrote a small book \"<a href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/9317784\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darkness and Destiny: The Four Empires in Midrash and Beyond</a>\" which collects all midrashic and outside sources on the four kingdoms. Unfortunately, it does not have a commentary, but it did pointed out for me the Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.99.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 99:2</a> which gives cryptic reasons for the fall of each of the four empires.</p>\n<p>Here's the part relevant to the question asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Benjamin opposite the kingdom of Media – this one was likened to a wolf, and that one was likened to a wolf. This one was likened to a wolf: “Benjamin is a wolf that mauls” (Genesis 49:27); and that one was likened to a wolf: “Behold another, a second beast, resembling a bear [<em>ledov</em>]” (Daniel 7:5) – Rabbi Ḥanina said: <em>Ledov</em> is written, but it was called <em>dev</em>. (Commentary: *The word dov, bear, is sometimes written with a vav. In this instance it is written without a vav, such that it can be read dev, which is Aramaic for ze’ev, wolf. Thus, the midrash is saying that Media is compared to a wolf.)  This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: ... “a wolf of the deserts will plunder them” (Jeremiah 5:6) – this is Media. Into the hands of whom did the kingdom of Media fall? Into the hands of Mordekhai, who descended from Benjamin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The midrash is amaizingly cryptic, so what does it mean? First of all, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a>, <strong>wolves live in packs which are led by strong leaders</strong>. Therefore, the midrash notes that in Persia there was a problem of the community leadership and internal community strife.</p>\n<p>We know, that Persian empire offered people unbelievable freedom, so that any girl could become a queen. Yalkut Meam Loez 1:5 in the name of Yearos D'vash points that the seven day banquet in Shushan began during the 10 days of repentance on the 3rd of Tishrei and ended on Yom Kippur (with kosher food). That was why Mordekhai protested that people should not come to the banquet, but they did not listen.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya ibn Pekudah in his commentary on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.38.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 38:25</a> points another problem among the Jews: they no longer viewed each other as equal members one community. Why did Haman offer 10,000 kikar of silver to Achashveirosh to eliminate all the jews, which weighted against the 100 kikar of <em>shekalim</em> brought by 600,000 Jews? Haman used the bigest valuation of Arachin, 50 shekels (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.27.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 27:3</a>) per male. Compared to half-shekel, 50 shekalim gives a factor of 100 and 10,000 = 100*100. In other words, Haman's accusation against the Jews was that even when raising money we did it according to the laws of Arachin (individually) and not according to the laws of Shekalim (same value for everyone).</p>\n<p>Certainly, the point of Rabbeinu Bachya also goes against the rule that in a pack of wolves everyone but the leader is equal. Today we fix these problems with the mitzvah of <em>shekalim before Purim</em> and sending the same <em>mishloach manos</em>, and of course with recognising the true value of Torah leaders like Mordekhai.

Or it could apply in the case that the Torah is forgotten, as happened in the wicked kings of Israel and in the time of Ezra, when the people needed to be reminded of the most basic commandments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה זה כפי משמעו הוא קרבן המשומד לכל התורה בשוגג, כגון ההולך ונדבק לאחת מן האומות לעשות כהם ולא ירצה להיות בכלל ישראל כלל. ויהיה כל זה בשוגג, כגון שיהיה ביחיד בתינוק שנשבה לבין הגוים ובקהל, כגון שיחשבו שכבר עבר זמן התורה ולא היתה לדורות עולם. או שיאמרו, כמוזכר בסיפרי (ספרי במדבר ט״ו:מ״א): מפני מה אמר המקום, לא שנעשה ונטול שכר? לא עושין ולא נוטלין. כענין שהיו ישראל אומרים ושואלין את יחזקאל שנאמר: ויבואו אלי אנשים מזקני ישראל וישבו לפני (יחזקאל י״ד:א׳). אמרו לו רבינו יחזקאל הרי עבד שמכרו רבו לא יצא מרשותו וכו׳. או שישכחו את התורה, וכבר אירע לנו כן בעונותינו כי בימי מלכי ישראל הרשעים כגון ירבעם שכחו רוב העם התורה והמצות לגמרי, וכאשר בא בספר עזרא באנשי בית שני.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The truth is that your question is about the slightly different case of ruling that one of the commandments (rather than the entire Torah) isn't in force; however, both answers might still apply: the Sanhedrin could reach the conclusion that one part of the Torah is abolished through a process of reasoning, or one part of the Torah could be forgotten.</p>\n\n\n",

Its inhabitants the Greeks called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tauri</a> or Scythotauri, Tauri Scythae, Tauroscythae (Pliny, H. N. 4.85). They were known in Greek texts for exceptional cruelty as Tauri engaged in piracy in the Black sea and were a big threat to the Greak power in the region. The geography of the peninsula is such that up until the end of 1940s most of the population could live on the southern coast of the peninsula separated by the mountains, hence the separation with Scythians in the north. Much of the northern part of the peninsula used to be a salty desert.

Another\nproblem in the text is the expression אעשה, \"I shall make for him a\nhelpmate.\" The Torah then immediately proceeds to describe that the\nmammals and the birds were formed, i.e. ויצר השם אלוקים (2,19). This\ngives the impression that G'd intended one of these animals to be\nman's helpmate. Such a thought is not only extremely strange, but if\ntrue it would also result in one of those animals being deprived of\nits own mate! Besides, why did G'd have to put Adam to sleep and to\nremove part of his body? Could He not have formed woman as dust from\nthe earth as He had formed man himself, especially since He formed Eve\non the very same day He formed Adam (5,2) זכר ונקבה בראם? Our sages\nhave given many homiletical explanations in answer to these questions,\nbut they have not provided us with פשט, straightforward answers that\njustify the text as it stands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or HaChaim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה לפי מה שקדם מדברי רז\"ל (עירובין יח) כי אדם וחוה דו פרצופין נבראו\nלמאן דאמר פרצוף, ולמאן דאמר זנב, כדאיתא במס' שבת, וכפי זה זאת האשה וזה\nבניינה כי מתחלה בראה דבוקה עמו ממש למ\"ד כסברתו ולמ\"ד כסברתו. ובסדר זה\nישנם גם כן בהכנת המוליד דהלא תמצא שאמר ה' להם (א' כח) פרו ורבו וגו'\nקודם הנסירה הא למדת שהכינם ה' להוליד גם בהיותם בסדר זה וזאת האשה אשר\nנסר ה' ולקחה ממקום דביקתה אשר בראה ביום הבראם.</p>\n<p>We may have to fall back on the opinions expressed in Berachot 61 that\noriginally man was created with two faces in one body. The Talmud\nthere offers two opinions as to what was removed from Adam, a tail or\na face, respectively. This is a reasonable explanation because it\njustifies G'd's blessing or command to Adam to be fruitful and to\nmultiply (1,28) at a time when woman had not yet been reported as a\nseparate entity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brachot 61a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִי נָמֵי כִּדְרַבִּי יִרְמְיָה בֶּן אֶלְעָזָר. דְּאָמַר רַבִּי\nיִרְמְיָה בֶּן אֶלְעָזָר: דּוּ פַּרְצוּפִין בָּרָא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ\nהוּא בָּאָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״אָחוֹר וָקֶדֶם צַרְתָּנִי״.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, this duplication in the language of creation can be\nexplained in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yirmeya ben\nElazar, as Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He,\ncreated two faces [du partzufin] on Adam the first man; he was created\nboth male and female in a single body, as it is stated: “You have\nformed me [tzartani] behind and before” (Psalms 139:5); tzartani is\nderived from the word tzura [face]. God formed two faces on a single\ncreation, back and front.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can translate כנגדו as “facing,” according to this reading.</p>\n<p>Holding a person accountable is a necessary part of any relationship. If we accept the interpretation of Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, the hermaphroditic two-faced Adam would not be able to do so insofar as it requires “facing” a person.</p>\n<p>Animals have many parallels to human faces, but they don’t have the level of intelligence that we have, and looking an animal in the eye yields a different experience. Animals can’t hold us to account for our actions.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shraga Silverstein translates it as follows, based on Rashi:</p>\n<p>“[I shall make him a help [(If he merits it, she is a help)], against him [(If he does not merit it, she is against him, contending with him)].”</p>\n<p>She helps him not “just by assistance in daily chores” but by withholding her help from him if he does not merit it. This means that G-d gives her the power to discern his merit.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Raba Hold That Mishnayot do not Need to Present Information in an Ascending Order of Novelty?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Tosfot's Premise: Mishnayot present cases in order of novelty - לא זו אף זו (See Tosfot Meilah 2a, ששחטן בדרום,  \" <strong>דסדר משנתינו כך הוא ששונה אותו שיש בו חידוש יות</strong>ר \"בסיפא )</p>\n<p>My Premise: Rabbinic Meilah is a greater novelty than Biblical Meilah. This is due to the fact that on a biblical level this particular sacrifice is useless due to an egregious defect, but nonetheless the rabbis instituted Meilah.</p>\n<p>Raba (Meilah 2b) seems to disagree with one of the premises.</p>\n<p>The Mishna in Meila 2a lists several sets of cases of defective animals which still retain the possibility of Meilah. <strong>Prima facie, they all retain biblical Meilah potentiality.</strong> The Talmud 2a expressly explains that the set of cases involving a holy of holies animal wrongfully slaughtered/blood received in the south of the courtyard goes first in the Mishna because it is the least novel (the defect, relatively speaking, is not that bad, and so it retains biblical Meilah). The set of cases involving wrongfully slaughtering/sprinkling blood of an animal at night, however, goes next because it represents an even greater defect (thus a greater novelty - that these latter cases, notwithstanding their more egregious defect, still retain biblical Meilah).</p>\n<p>The Talmud then introduces a game changer on 2b:</p>\n<p>תְּנַן: קׇדְשֵׁי קָדָשִׁים שֶׁשְּׁחָטָן בַּדָּרוֹם – מוֹעֲלִין בָּהֶן. בִּשְׁלָמָא לְרַב יוֹסֵף נִיחָא, אֶלָּא לְרַבָּה קַשְׁיָא! מַאי מוֹעֲלִין בָּהֶן – מִדְּרַבָּנַן.\nWe learned in the mishna: With regard to offerings of the most sacred order that were disqualified before their blood was sprinkled on the altar, if one slaughtered them in the south of the Temple courtyard, he is liable for misusing them if he derives benefit from them. Granted, according to the opinion of Rav Yosef, this halakha works out well. But according to the opinion of Rabba, it is difficult: The Gemara explains: What is the meaning of the clause: One is liable for misusing them? <strong>This means that one is liable for misusing them by rabbinic law,</strong> but they are not subject to the halakhot of misuse by Torah law.</p>\n<p><strong>To recap - the first set of cases in the Mishna per Raba (in R. Shimon) - the set of slaughtering/receiving blood in the south - is rabbinical Meilah only. The rest of the cases in the opening Mishna (night etc.), however, are biblical. BUT this means, per Raba, that a set of cases involving rabbinic Meilah precedes cases in the Mishna that involve Biblical Meilah?!! Are we still ascending in order of novelty? Does Raba even care?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

However, in 2:18, G-d says, “it is not good for him to be alone.”</p>\n<p>How is this possible? The Or HaChaim adds that in 1:28, G-d gives Man the command to be fruitful and multiply, at a time when the Torah has not yet mentioned the existence of Woman as a separate entity. We may have to rely on the explanation of Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar in the Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 61a, he concludes.</p>\n<p>According to Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, G-d initially created Adam with two faces, each facing a different direction, with the capacity to reproduce independently.</p>\n<p>In 2:21, G-d makes the two-faced Adam fall unconscious and takes “מצלעתיו”, closing over the flesh. Rabbi Shraga Silverstein translates מצלעתיו as “sides,” which is consistent with the Talmud, indicating that this primordial surgery removed the male half of Adam from the female half.</p>\n<p>Aside from addressing the two-faced Adam’s loneliness, what was the purpose of this surgery?</p>\n<p>In 2:18, G-d says, “I shall make a helpmate for him.” However, “for him” is the word כנגדו, which also means “against” or “facing” him. It can also mean opposite, against, before, in view, in sight of, conspicuous to, in the presence of, parallel to, from before, open to, known to, etc.</p>\n<p>Holding a person accountable is a necessary part of any relationship. If we accept the interpretation of Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, the two-faced Adam would not be able to do so insofar as it requires “facing” a person. The two-faced Adam didn’t have a contemporary to hold him accountable.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Silverstein brings this translation:</p>\n<p>“I shall make him a help [(If he merits it, she is a help)], against him [(If he does not merit it, she is against him, contending with him)].”</p>\n<p>The Or HaChaim also shows that immediately after this verse, the Torah describes the animals, as if to suggest that they did not merit to be Adam’s partner.</p>\n<p>Mekoros:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or HaChaim:</p>\n<p>ויאמר ה' וגו' לא טוב וגו'. קשה הלא כבר ביום ברא אלהים אדם זכר ונקבה\nברא אותם, עוד קשה אומרו סמוך לו אעשה לו עזר כנגדו וגומר ויצר וגומר כל\nחית השדה, שנראה שרצה לזווג לו חית השדה וזה פלא לזווג אדם ובהמה, ועוד\nשיסיר נקבת בהמה או חיה מבן זוגה ולזווגה עם האדם, עליונים למטה ותחתונים\nלמעלה, עוד קשה אומרו ויפל ה' תרדמה וגו', וכי לא היה ה' יכול לברוא לו\nבת זוגו עפר מן האדמה. מלבד מה שהקשינו שמצינו לו שברא לו בת זוגו ביום\nהבראו וכמו שהעיד הכתוב אחר כן זכר ונקבה בראם וגו' ביום הבראם ורז\"ל\nאמרו דרשות רבות וצריכין פותר אבל פשט הכתוב לא מצאנוהו: ויאמר השם\nאלוקים לא טוב.</p>\n<p>The Lord G'd said: \"It is not good for man to be alone, etc.\" This is\ndifficult since G'd had mentioned already on the day He created man\nthat the species had been created male and female (1,27).

God also doesn't show any sign of puzzlement or confusion.

If the order in the second chapter confuses you, you can say that those animals are additional, exemplar animals for the naming. Or you could say that bestiality also applies to fish and birds.</p>\n<p>Regarding adultery, perhaps the unseparated Adam was a married unit and bestiality would also be adultery?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Bereshit 2:19, it says \"And Hashem Elokim formed (ויצר) all the beasts of the field from the earth...\"  Rashi on the spot comments that this \"creating\" (yetzirah) is the same \"making\" (asiyah) which is referenced earlier in 1:25, when it says \"And Elokim made the beasts of the field according to their types, and the domesticated animals according to their types, and those that creep in the earth according to their type, and Elokim saw that it was good.\"  Here in 2:19, says Rashi, the text is returning to an earlier topic and giving us more information previously unrevealed.</p>\n<p>Note that the word used in 1:25 is עשה, not ברא.</p>\n<p>So the prohibition against bestiality is not a question, as the animals already existed, and Adam saw them about him.

Finally, God creates Eve and we all know how badly the story ended (Gen 3).</p>\n<p>It appears that in Gen 1 God knows what He's doing and enjoys the fruits of His creation, while in Gen 2, He consistently changes His mind and tries to fix it.</p>\n<p>Why such a stark contrast?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can it be connected with using YHWH Elohim instead of Elohim alone as God's name?</li>\n<li>Can it reflect the difference between the ideal world of בריאה (creation) and our less-than-ideal material world of יצירה (formation)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: I found <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40218/differences-between-genesis-1-and-2\">a related question about the differences in the narrative</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When discussing the other elements of the physical universe aside from mankind, the Torah seems satisfied to inform us that Hashem made them, and they are as He intended them to be, which is indeed very good.  It is not necessary for the Torah to teach us deeply about the nature of fishes or mountains or birds, as none of these things impact on the purpose of the Torah, which is to teach us how to be human beings.  To the extent that it is useful to us to learn about these physical elements of our world, we should get up and investigate the world, observe it and learn.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to humanity, the Torah indeed needs to teach us about the nature of humanity, which is our nature, because this impacts profoundly on the purpose of the Torah.  And so here we are informed that \"it is not good for man to be alone,\" that men are fundamentally and unbridgably apart from the animal world, about the risks of social interaction, and more.</p>\n<p>All of these things are part of the task for which the Torah was created; namely, to teach us how to be the human beings that Hashem had in mind, both as a species and as individuals.  And so here, it is not enough to say that in the big picture it is \"very good.\"  Rather, here the Torah must go into details and teach us about different ways in which we might fail, so that we can learn from the text and avoid the experience.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually, there is one aspect in Genesis 1 that is not good. The second day of creation is not called good by God. There is no mention of good in Genesis 1:6-8 concerning the second day. However, the third day makes up for this with two labels of good.</p>\n<p>Seems as though Genesis 1 is a creation account from the \"heavenly\" perspective, (Genesis 1:1) since Genesis 2's creation account is from an \"earthly\" perspective. Earth is first before Heaven in the latter part of Genesis 2:4. Adam is also created first according to Genesis 2 (unlike in Genesis 1), so from man's point of view, it does seem as though things are not good and that they need to be fixed. Man has a very limited perspective.</p>\n<p>The heavenly perspective in Genesis 1 transcends time and is probably already looking at the Messianic era of the year 6000 AM. Hence why everything is good and in order according to chapter 1.</p>\n<p>This is just my guess though. Feel free to disagree.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the documentary hypothesis, Gen. 1 and Gen. 2 are from two different authors. While most Orthodox Jews reject the this hypothesis, <a href=\"https://merrimackvalleyhavurah.wordpress.com/2023/09/03/orthodox-judaism-moving-towards-documentary-hypothesis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several Orthodox rabbis</a> have begun to do so.  Many Conservative and Reform rabbis accept it.</p>\n<p>The hypothesis indeed focuses on the fact that \"YHWH Elohim\" is the name of God in Gen. 2 while simply Elohim alone as is God's name in Gen 1. Scholars who uphold this view hold that Gen. 1 was composed somewhat later than Gen. 2 and expresses the idea of God's absolute sovereignty over all creation. Gen. 2 expresses a time (possibly during the reign of King Hezekiah) when both female deities and snake gods still represented a threat. Thus the woman and the serpent are presented as opposed to God's will in Gen. 2, while in Gen. 1 - as the OP points out - \"all is good.\"</p>\n\n\n",

In Biblical Hebrew, עזר means help, rescue, and כנגדו though a singleton, should mean something close to נגד - against, opposing, or facing, like in \"וַיִּחַן־שָׁם יִשְׂרָאֵל נֶגֶד הָהָר\".</p>\n<p>So \"<em>rescue against him</em>\" - doesn't make sense, it should rather read \"עזר לו\", or \"עזר בשבילו\".</p>\n<p>How can this phrase be meaningful in its plain reading (Peshat) in Biblical Hebrew?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Slightly related <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/144910/was-eve-created-for-rescue-rather-than-assistance\">\"עזר - rescue or assistance?\"</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Compare to Tehillim 16:8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שִׁוִּ֬יתִי ה' לְנֶגְדִּ֣י תָמִ֑יד כִּ֥י מִֽ֝ימִינִ֗י בַּל־אֶמּֽוֹט</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have put Hashem לנגדי always, because He is at my right hand I will not\nstumble.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, לנגדי obviously does not mean \"opposing me,\" but something like \"in front of me.\"  David declares that because Hashem is always before him, in his thoughts, therefore He will offer help and protection and David can be confident that he will not come to harm.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the simple פשט reading of \"כנגדו\" is similar.  The woman shall be a helper \"before him,\" in his immediate presence rather than at a remote distance.  This fits well with the Divine statement in the same verse that \"It is not good for man to be alone.\"  Because it is not good for him to be alone, he will be provided a helper that will live with him and be constantly with him, ending his state of \"aloneness.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are multiple valid ways to translate it into English, but the one that makes most sense to me is “a helper facing him,” because facing can mean opposite, against, before, in view, in sight of, conspicuous to, in the presence of, parallel to, from before, open to, known to, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Like is understand from Rashi's commentary to the Chumash, Peshat also includes proper grammar usage. (<em>His commentary is a tremendous resource for the correct rules of Hebrew grammar.</em>) Your translation of עזר as a verb is incorrect.</p>\n<p>In the expression, it is used as a <em>noun</em>. As a noun, it means \"<em><strong>assistant</strong></em>\" or \"<em><strong>complement</strong></em>\", meaning <strong>a thing</strong> that completes and is \"<em>complementary to</em>\" the subject in the sentence, meaning the individual, <em>the husband</em>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, כנגדו is being used as an <em>adjective</em> <em>modifying the subject</em> of the sentence (<em>indicated by the suffix letter</em> ו), which is \"<em><strong>him</strong></em>\", meaning <em>the man</em>, <em>the husband</em>. (<em>Just to emphasize, it does not say</em> כנגדה, <em>meaning corresponding to <strong>her</strong>.</em>)</p>\n<p>The root, נגד, has several different meanings, which explains why the prefix letter \"כ\" is also applied. That prefix can have a meaning of \"like\" or \"according to\". This means that <em>the type of assistance from the wife</em> <strong>varies</strong> <em><strong>according to the character and need of</strong> the husband</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

I remember seeing this instruction in the siddur for the house of mourning that was provided for our use by the local funeral home. I always assumed that this was related to the fact that \"<em>titkabel</em>\" is omitted on Tisha b'Av, and that it is not included in the <em>Kaddish Yatom</em>.</p>\n<p>However, at a shiva house this evening none of the other people present were aware of this custom, and I could find no mention of it in either the Artscroll or the Koren siddur.  Now I'm wondering if I am misremembering, or if I hallucinated the whole thing.  (For what it's worth, at the time I sat shiva we were using a Conservative siddur, not an Orthodox one, so perhaps this is something specific to Conservative practice.)</p>\n<p>Can anybody enlighten me on whether this is an actual practice, and (if so) whether it is limited only to certain communities or if it is more generally observed? Sources are appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>Edited:</strong> Shortly after posting this question I found the following <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/160104/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on the OU website</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although some have the custom to omit the \"titkabel\" passage from the final kaddish recited at the end of services in a shiva house, it is reported that Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was very against this practice and insisted that the final kaddish be recited in its entirety as normal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to both confirm that the custom exists while simultaneously arguing against it. It does not, however, provide any sources for where this custom comes from, who follows it, and whether there are any other respected poskim who hold differently than Rabbi Feinstein, so I would still appreciate any information that can be provided.</p>\n\n\n",

In my debates, I was frequently pointed out that <em>\"a particular view is \"not Orthodox</em>\", and that caused me to ponder about a method, an algorithm for concluding whether a particular view <em>can be seen</em> as orthodox.</p>\n<p>My difficulty in finding one is the fact that the adoption and letting go of ideas in traditional Rabbinic/Talmudic Judaism <em>seems</em> arbitrary and accidental, largely depending on the characters and circumstances involved, not the essence of the ideas themselves.</p>\n<p>For example, monogamy was considered \"Orthodox\" in Christian Europe, while polygamy was \"Orthodox\" in the Islamic world.

That would be a hard thing to do, as two of the Patriarchs had multiple wives simultaneously, as well as various great figures after the Giving of the Torah, most notably Kings David and Solomon!</p>\n<p>But monogamy, which even in Biblical times was preferred, has certainly become a very strongly-entrenched custom amongst Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, and I would be extraordinarily surprised if polygamy ever returned.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources for the Noncontradiction principle in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>IMU, the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Law of Noncontradiction</a>\" does not <em>apply</em> in religion in general - same rabbis can hold opposing views and contradicting Halochos can coexist (see אֵלּוּ וְאֵלּוּ דִּבְרֵי אֱלֹהִים חַיִּים, Eruvin 13).</p>\n<p>My question is whether some sources for the existence of such a principle can be found in the scripture or Rabbinic literature?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe that, contrary to your assertion that the Law of Noncontradiction does not exist in Judaism, it is in fact fundamental to the entire Talmud.</p>\n<p>For example, just on Yoma 14b, which I happen to have studied recently, it appears four times.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Gemara derives from the Mishna that in the daily service in the Temple, first the incense was burnt, and afterwards the Menorah was cleansed of ashes that had accumulated.  It questions how this can be, given that it contradicts a Mishna elsewhere (in Tamid) which gives the opposite order.</li>\n<li>In response to the answer of Rav Huna, who asserts that unattributed Mishnayos in Tamid follow the views of Rabbi Shimon Ish Hamitzpeh (and therefore represent a different opinion than unattributed Mishnayos in Yoma), the Gemara asks how this can be.  A beraisa in Tamid has Rabbi Shimon Ish Hamitzpeh arguing against the view of an unattributed Mishna there; thus we see that he is not the author of unattributed Mishnayos there.</li>\n<li>Following (but not in response to) the answer of Rabbi Yochanan, who asserts that unattributed Mishnayos in Yoma follow the view of Rabbi Shimon Ish Hamitzpeh, the Gemara questions an apparent contradiction within Yoma itself.  On the one hand, the local Mishna puts the incense prior to the cleansing of the Menorah. On the other hand, another Mishna in Yoma puts the cleansing of the Menorah first and the burning of the incense afterwards.</li>\n<li>In response to Abaye's answer, that first five arms of the Menorah were cleansed, then the incense was burnt, then the remaining two arms of the Menorah were cleansed (thus, each Mishna refers to one part of cleansing the Menorah), the Gemara asks how could this be.  Abaye seems to contradict himself, for he says elsewhere that the sprinkling of the blood of the Daily Offering, not the burning of the incense, was in between the two stages of cleansing the Menorah.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Much Talmudic argumentation takes this form.  Some statement X is quoted or proposed.  The statement is questioned because it contradicts a more authoritative source, or because the rabbi that proposed it thereby contradicts himself--that is, at face value, statement X violates the Law of Noncontradiction.  Then, either a resolution is found, or else statement X is abandoned.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Eruvin which you reference says the following:  Rabbi Abba declared in the name of Shmuel, for three years Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel debated.  Each said \"the halacha is like our opinion.\"  Finally, a Bas Kol (Heavenly Voice) emerged and said that both these and those are the words of the Living G-d, but the halacha is like Beis Hillel.</p>\n<p>It seems clear from this that in fact the halacha cannot be self-contradictory.  While both Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai found favor in Hashem's eyes, and one who studies the words of either is credited with studying Torah, the practical halacha must follow one or the other.</p>\n<p>I do not know what source you think you have for the assertion that one rabbi can hold two contradictory opinions.</p>\n\n\n",

W. Tanner commented, Radak writes that it is a musical signifier (cf Septuagint and Vulgate).</p>\n<p>Artcroll is presumably agreeing with the latter interpretation and therefore leaves it as it is—a hebrew musical term (as does the KJV).</p>\n<p>(Radak, Tehillim, 3:3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Selah – The majority of commentators say of the word Selah that it is equivalent to לעולם (\"for ever\"); and so Jonathan renders it in the Prayer of Habakkuk (iii. 3, 9, 13) for ever (לעלמין). And in this sense the word is common in our prayers. And the learned Rabbi Abraham ben Ezra – may the memory of the just be blessed! – has interpreted (ad loc.) that it is equivalent to אמת (truth). For myself, I say it is not a significant word. And it is to be interpreted as having the meaning \"lifting up\" (of the musical accompaniment) from (the passage) \"cast up, cast up (סלו) the way\" (Is. Ixii. 10), signifying that at the point where this word is mentioned and read there was a raising of the sound of the music (מזמור). And the proof is in the fact that it is not found except in this book and in the Prayer of Habakkuk, which was a song (accompanied by music), as is written also there (iii. 19), \"For the chief musician on my stringed instruments.\")</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ditto if you accept Hoil Moshe's suggestion that it is a way of referring to HaShem.</p>\n<p>(Hoil Moshe, ibid, 3:9:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Selah — Many interpretations have been offered for this word (see Otzar HaShorashim by Rabbi Wolf Heidenheim), and it seems to me that the most accurate meaning of the term, according to tradition (its translation as \"forever\"), is the most correct one. We only find it in Psalms and two or three times in the prayer of the prophet Habakkuk, which was composed according to the shigyonot, meaning in the style of songs known as shigyon (see what I will write, with God's help, on the meaning of the word shigyon, at the beginning of Psalm 7). Certainly, the songs of David were never forgotten by the people of Israel, not even for a single generation, and the meaning of this word has been preserved for us correctly through tradition.</p>\n<p>If we investigate its origin, we find its pattern in the word herah (\"flee\" in Genesis 12:8), which is similar to \"ascending\" (lehar, \"to the mountain\"). Selah is from the root that appears in \"You are still exalted (mistolel) among my people\" (Exodus 9:17) and \"Extol Him who rides upon the heavens\" (Psalm 68:5), meaning to exalt and lift high (even though, in truth, the lamed [in salu] ought to be emphasized). Therefore, the basic application of the word Selah is as a reference to God, blessed be He. Just as we find that the word netzach is a reference to Him (and also netzach Yisrael, 1 Samuel 15:29) and is also used as a verbal form meaning \"forever,\" the same applies to the word Selah. Examine Meir Natib, and you will find that in every instance it can be explained with one of these two meanings. None of the other interpretations offered in the Otzar HaShorashim are valid in all cases without significant difficulty.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is a good question why it is not translated.

    "content": "# Ki Savo: Idols of Wood and Stone\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Devarim 28:64 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וֶהֱפִֽיצְךָ֤ יְהֹוָה֙ בְּכׇל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים מִקְצֵ֥ה הָאָ֖רֶץ\nוְעַד־קְצֵ֣ה הָאָ֑רֶץ וְעָבַ֨דְתָּ שָּׁ֜ם אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר\nלֹא־יָדַ֛עְתָּ אַתָּ֥ה וַאֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ עֵ֥ץ וָאָֽבֶן׃</p>\n<p>יהוה will scatter you among all the peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and\nthere you shall serve other gods, wood and stone, whom neither you nor\nyour ancestors have experienced</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, the galus part came true literally, but I am wondering about the אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר לֹא־יָדַ֛עְתָּ אַתָּ֥ה וַאֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ עֵ֥ץ וָאָֽבֶן.</p>\n<p>B’zmanenu, there are still certain groups who perform avodah zara for wooden idols, but they are not at all dominant outside of India l’choira.</p>\n<p>Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועבדתם שם אלהים אחרים. כְּתַרְגּוּמוֹ — לֹא עֲבוֹדַת אֱלֹהוּת מַמָּשׁ\nאֶלָּא מַעֲלִים מַס וְגֻלְגֹּלִיּוֹת לְכוּמְרֵי עֲ\"זָ: ועבדתם שם אלהים\nאחרים</p>\n<p>AND YE WILL SERVE THERE OTHER GODS — Understand this as the\nTargum does: (ye will serve the peoples that worship idols); not\nactually that they shall serve idols, but they will have to pay\ntribute and poll-taxes to the priests of the idols.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes sense in Rashi’s France, when his government was explicitly Christian, but how do we understand this for our generation?</p>\n<p>Are our “idols” money and values contrary to Torah? Are the “priests” politicians and bureaucrats?</p>\n<p>Edit: this question is distinct from another question regarding the idea of contemporary nochri idolatry in that it is with reference to this particular pasuk.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Satmar Rav (Divrei Yoel Al HaMoadim, Shekalim, Zachor, Purim, p. 54-55 ff.) explains that nowadays, we have different kind of avodah zarah than there was back in the days. He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי הנה כן אנו רואים היום שמלבישים תמיד איזה צורה אחרת לעבודה זרה ועל ידי זה כבר נמשכים אחריה שאומרים שאינו כמו אותו עד עכשיו אלא שהוא באופן אחר</p>\n<p>For indeed, we see today that idolatry is constantly being disguised in new forms, and through this disguise, people are led astray after it. They claim that it is not the same as the idolatry of the past but something different</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזאת ועוד נוסף כי אכן לאמיתו של דבר הרי המתבונן מבחין שבאמת נשאר הכל ממש כאותו העבודה זרה שהיתה מלפנים אלא שיש בכוחו של היצר הרע לטכס עצה ולמצוא תמיד איזה לבוש שונה באופן אחר שיוכל להלביש בזה את העבודה זרה שתהיה נראית שהיא אחרת</p>\n<p>Moreover, upon closer reflection, one can discern that in reality, nothing has changed—it remains exactly the same idolatry as it was before. The only difference is that the evil inclination has the ability to devise new strategies and continuously find different ways to cloak idolatry in various forms</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to the opinion of the Satmar Rav, avodah zarah changes. De avodah zarah of the time of pharao is not the same as we have now, but the foundational ideas are the same.</p>\n<p>He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומעתה נאמר שכל זה רמוז באומרו לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים דהנה אמרו ז\"ל במכילתא מכילתא ס' בחודש פ\"ס ומובא ברש\"י שמוח כ' ג' לבאר אומרו לא יהיה וגו' על פני כל זמן שאני קיים שלא תאמר שלא נצטוו על ע\"ז אלא אותו הדור ע\"כ ולדרכינו הכוונה שלא תאמר שלא נצטוו אלא על אותו הלבוש והדמות שהיתה נראית העבודה זרה שבאותו הדור ולכן אמר אלהים אחרים היינו שנצטוו גם אפילו אם ישתנו דמותי וצורות הע\"ז שיהיו נראין באופן אחר מכפי שהיו אז וכדבר האמור שהצורות והלבושים שלהם משתנים תמיד וזהו כוונת אומרו שאלו נפרש להם כל שם ע\"ז לא היה מספיק כל העורות שבעולם דהנה גם אצל פרעה לא היו רק אותם הע\"ז שהיו אז בימיו אבל לא היה יודע מה שיהיה אחריו וכל אופני שמות העבודה זרה שיש בימינו אלה לא היה לו בספרו אמנם כוונת המכילתא הוא על כל אופני העבודה זרה שיתחדשו בהמשך כל הדורות ועל כך אמרו שאכן אם ירצו לכתוב כולם מה שהיו בהמשך הזמנים ועד לימינו אלה בעיקבתא דמשיחא שתמיד משתנים בדמותם ולבושיהם השונים הרי ודאי שלא היה מספיק כל העורות שבעולם כי אין להם שיעור</p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, the forms and appearances of idolatry are\nconstantly changing. This is what the verse means when it says that if\nwe were to specify the name of every idol, all the hides in the world\nwould not suffice. Just as in the time of Pharaoh, only the idols of\nhis time were known, but he had no knowledge of the idols that would\ncome after him, nor did his book contain the names of all the forms of\nidolatry that exist in our time. The intention of the Mechilta is to\nencompass all forms of idolatry that will arise throughout the\ngenerations. And they said that if one were to attempt to write down\nall the forms of idolatry that have existed from then until today, in\nthe footsteps of the Messiah, where idolatry constantly changes its\nform and appearance, all the hides in the world would not suffice, for\nthere is no limit to them</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One can use the quoted passage to include atheism. In colleges professors like to tell a story that polytheists worship many gods, monotheists worship one god, and then there are progressive atheists who do not worship anyone. As an answer, one can use the comment of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mizrachi%2C_Genesis.18.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliyahu Mizrachi on Rashi Bereshis 18:4</a>, which defines atheism as <em>avoda zara</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורחצו רגליכם כסבור שהם ערביים כו'. במציעא פרק השוכר את הפועלים ולאו מרחיצה קא מפיק לה דאם כן לבן שלא היה מקפיד למה נתן להם מים לרחוץ וכן לוט שלא היה מקפיד שהרי הקדי' לינה לרחיצה למה נתן להם לרחוץ אלא עכ\"ל דרחיצה אורחא דמילתא היא לכל הולכי דרכים והא דדרז\"ל אינו אלא מדהקדים רחיצה לביאה שלא כדרך המנהג שמנהג העולם להכניסם תחלה ואחר כך לרחוץ והיינו דמסיים אבל לוט שלא הקפיד הקדים לינה לרחיצה כלומר כפי דרך המנהג לא כאברהם דאם לא כן מה טעם להזכיר כאן את לוט ונראה לי דאבק רגליהם לאו דוקא אלא לכל אבק הם משתחוים והא דנקט אבק רגליהם משום דאורחייהו דהולכי דרכים להמצא האבק ברגליהם והא דלא הקפיד בהם על שהיו עובדי כוכבים להכניסם בביתו הוא משו' דאין מקפידין על העובדי' אלא על הנעבדי' שהם עבודת כוכבים עצמם ומפני שכל הלומדים תמהי' על זה היאך אפשר להיות שישתחוה שום אדם לאבק שעל רגליו שהוא הפחות שבנמצאות נראה לי לתת טעם על זה שמפני שהקדמוני' מהפלוסופים היו מאמינים שכל הנמצאות כלם מורכבים מהעצמים הפרדיים שהם האבק ושבחבורם יתהוו כל הנמצאים ובהפרדם יפסדו ושאין מנהיג זולתם רק הם עצמם האלוהו' כמו כת אפיקורוס וסיעתו והאבק נמצא תמיד ברגלי הולכי דרכים הוכרח אברהם אבינו ע\"ה לתת להם מים לרחוץ טרם הכנסם בביתו כדי שלא יכנסו בביתו עם האבק שהיו משתחוים לו לשום אלהות לא שהיו משתחוים לאבק שברגליהם ממש:</p>\n<p><strong>And wash your feet as you think they are Arabs</strong>, etc. The incident is noted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.86b.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziya 86b</a>, perek haSocher es Poalim. And if he did not perform the wash, in the case of Lavan, who was not particular, why did he gave (Eliezer) water to wash (feet) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.32?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 24:32</a>)? And also Lot, who was not careful, because he offered spending night before washing (feet), why did he offer them to wash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 19:2</a>)? Rather, washing was a common custom for all wayfarers. But from the drasha of RZ\"L in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.86b.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziya 86b</a> it is not so, because Abraham preceded washing (feet) to coming into (the tent) contrary to custom entering the tent and then washing (as Lot did).</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the verse is not speaking simply (לאו דוקא) of the dust of the (travelers) feet. Rather, to all kinds of \"dust\" (i.e. materiality) the bow. And here it chose to speak of the dust of their feet because it is the way of travelers to have dust on their feet. Thus [Lot] was not particular about it when bringing [guests] into the house because he only focused on those who bow to stars themselves. Because anyone who learns wonders how is it possible for a human to bow to dust on one's feet, which is less than material amount? I would like to give reason to it. The ancient philosophers, such as the sect of Epicurus and his helpers, believed that all things that exist are composed of the individual particles that are the dust; and that by joining them one can bring to existence all things; and by separating them one can destroy all things; and that there is no force other than them, only these particles are god himself. Since the dust is always at the feet of wayfarers, Abraham our father was forced to give them water to bathe before entering his tent so that they would not enter his house with the dust that they would bow down as deification of materiality, not that they bowed down to the dust itself on their very feet:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The teachings of Epicurus are pretty much the foundation of the modern atheism. R. Mizrachi states that one cannot view these teachings other than <em>avoda zara</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

How did the priests keep up?  Even the act of leading a bull to the alter would be no small task.  Grateful for any insight.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In the following <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQmfQ5H2vTg&t=166s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">video</a> Simcha Jacobovici explains that based on the size of the bones they find in archeological digs in Israel, the biblical cows were smaller 2000 years ago. There was not so much problem in doing the task as a result. Additional proof one can find in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Lachish\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siege of Lachish relief</a> found in Ninveh (capital of Assyrian Empire), which documents the battle of Assyrian and Israeli armies, and the aftermath exile of the Israelites by Sanherib.

Therefore, a grown Kohein could lead, tie, and slaughter tied oxen on his own.

Thirteen kohanim altogether would win this lottery.  Ben\nAzzai quoted the view of Rabbi Yehoshua in the presence of Rabbi Akiva\nthat the sacrifice was brought up in the order in which it walked\n(that is, first the front parts of the animal, and then the back parts\nof the animal).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, it is obvious that this could only be done once a sufficient population of kohanim existed.  In the early days, when it was only Aaron and his sons, they must have been very busy indeed!</p>\n\n\n",

Since the Golden Calf was made (as the name suggests) of gold, it would be wrong to use gold in this service.  So too, says Ulla, since the Golden Calf was (as the name suggests) a statue of a calf, it would be wrong to use a cow's horn for the shofar.</p>\n<p>The Gemara on the spot asks why the Kohen Gadol does wear Golden Vestments on other occasions, and answers that the rule of \"the accuser cannot become the defender\" only applies inside the Holy of Holies.  If so, the Gemara asks of itself, what does the rule of \"the accuser cannot become the defender\" have to do with the shofar of Rosh Hashana, which is blown outside the Holy of Holies?  The answer given is that the Torah describes the shofar as being for \"remembrance,\" and this is the equivalent of being inside the Holy of Holies.</p>\n<p>About a page later, on 26b , another Mishna teaches that the shofar used in the Beis Hamikdash was partially gold plated.  (This point appears to be unanimous amongst all the Tannaim.)</p>\n<p>My question is this--how would Ulla explain this Mishna?  Why does not the rule of \"the accuser does not become the defender\" prevent us from decorating the shofar with gold plate, just as it prevents the Kohen Gadol from wearing the Golden Vestments inside the Holy of Holies?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The shofar's sound, which causes 'remembrance', is what makes it considered akin to being 'inside'.</p>\n<p>The gold, which adorns the shofar, invalidates the shofar if it impacts the sound.</p>\n<p>As the gold contributes no part to the sound emitted and by extension the 'remembrance' generated, it is therefore not considered as being 'inside'.</p>\n\n\n",

Sterling, \"When Silence Is Golden: The Omission of the Golden Calf Story in Josephus\", in: <em>Golden Calf Traditions in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam</em>, pp. 87-96 discussed the possibility you suggested in the comments regarding the libel of the statue in the Temple, but rejected it on the grounds of Josephus still mentioning Jeroboam's two golden calves later in Antiquities, as well as multiple other instances of Israelite idolatry.</p>\n<p>He suggested a combination of two other reasons instead:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Tremendous respect for Aaron. Other ancient Hellenistic Jewish authors had difficulties with Aaron's embarrassing sin, and more so Josephus, who wrote about Aaron in glowing terms elsewhere. In this omission, Josephus was not different from Philo and the later Pseudo-Philo, who also skirted over the topic. Philo did mention the calf, but did not state that Aaron created it. Pseudo-Philo restructured the narrative so it'd be more clear that Aaron did it because he knew that he would be in mortal danger if he did not comply with the nation's demands.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Respect for the sacredness of the tablets and the commandments - Josephus did not want it be known that Moshe had broken the first set of tablets in anger, which were sacred in his (Josephus's) eyes. This second reason explains why Josephus didn't pursue a description similar to that of Philo or Pseudo-Philo (i.e., freeing Aaron from blame), instead preferring to omit the story entirely.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding is that Antiquities was written for a Roman audience and Josephus was trying to portray the Jews in as favorable and sophisticated a light as possible.</p>\n\n\n",

It involves numerous mythological figures, including gods and demons, many of whom are drawn from Buddhist and Taoist traditions. This does raise questions about avodah zara (idol worship) because the novel includes depictions of deities and practices that are associated with foreign religions.</p>\n<p>When considering if reading such a book is avodah zara, we can approach the issue from a halachic perspective:</p>\n<pre><code>Actual Worship vs. Study: Avodah zara generally refers to the actual worship or participation in forbidden practices. Simply reading about non-Jewish religious ideas or mythologies does not necessarily fall under this prohibition, especially if the intent is not to engage in those practices. Many poskim allow the study of such material for academic or literary purposes as long as it doesn't lead to admiration or respect for the foreign gods or practices described (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 147:2).\n\nThe Concern of Influence: However, there is a concern about exposure to ideas that could influence one’s emunah (faith) or lead to improper thoughts. The Rambam in Hilchos Avodah Zarah (2:2) emphasizes distancing oneself from foreign religious ideologies, which could affect one's spiritual purity.\n\nEntertainment Value: If someone is reading the book purely for its entertainment value, without taking the religious elements seriously, it may be more lenient. But still, it's recommended to have a level of caution regarding materials that openly promote or depict avodah zara, even in a fictionalized format.\n</code></pre>\n<p>In conclusion, while reading Journey to the West isn't technically avodah zara if read for academic or literary purposes, it's important to be mindful of the content and how it might affect one’s beliefs. It’s advisable to consult with a local Rav for a more personalized psak, especially if one feels that the material might be spiritually compromising.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 307:16 (translation mine, with my own comments in italics):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is forbidden to read stories, parables regarding secular matters,\nlove stories like the Book of Emanuel, books of wars (<em>possibly he\nmeans adventure stories</em>) on Shabbat.

But I don't have access to any.</p>\n<p>[Question edited in light of answer below.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya.</p>\n<p>You're using a modernized version of the 17th century edition of \"The Abbreviated English Josippon: The Wonderful and Deplorable History of the Jews\". As the editors of that volume <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_the-wonderful-and-most-_josippon_1669/page/n23/mode/2up\" rel=\"noreferrer\">stated</a> themselves, the first section of the book was taken from older works (Josephus, Maccabees, etc.), which they found to be helpful to the readers. The passage you're quoting is from that section and doesn't appear in Josippon itself. I don't know from where exactly they chose to quote, but the list of verses changed by the 72 sages who authored the LXX appears in a number of Talmudic sources, chief among them Mekhilta de-Rabbi Yishmael 14:17:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...\"כיוצא בו כתבו אליו...\"כי באפם הרגו שור וברצונם עקרו אבוס...\"<br />\nMy translation: \"....similarly, they wrote for him [Ptolemy]...\"for in their anger they killed an ox and when pleased they maimed a manger (can also be translated as \"crib\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This also appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.9.15?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Megillah 1:9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.9a.15?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bavli Megillah 9a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tractate_Sefer_Torah.1.9?vhe=Talmud_Bavli,_Vilna_1883_ed.&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tractate Sefer Torah 1:9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tractate_Soferim.1.8?vhe=Talmud_Bavli,_Vilna_1883_ed.&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tractate Soferim 1:8</a>, and a specific mention in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereshit_Rabbah.98.5?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 98:5</a> (mentions of other specific changes can be found in various sources).</p>\n<p>As Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.9a.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Megillah.9a.15.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">explains</a> in his commentary on Megillah 9a, this change was made so that the king wouldn't be led to conclude that the ancestors of the Jews were bloodthirsty murderers.</p>\n<p>I don't know exactly what you mean by the verse in this text being slightly different from the MT, but I'll assume you mean that the English wording is different from what you found on Sefaria. While it's not farfetched to imagine that the original author of Josippon had a slightly different Masoretic tradition, in this case it's not evidence of a different MT, as each translator chooses a different way of translation (and all the more so given that this section was not translated from Josippon but likely from one of the early printed [=re: standardized] editions of one of the above referenced works, or from a work that quoted such an edition).</p>\n<p>As an aside, I believe the only critical edition of Josippon is David Flusser's edition, which is based on the oldest complete manuscript, MS Jerusalem. However, to my knowledge it cannot be accessed online for free (but vol. 1 can be found on the Kotar website and vol. 2 on Otzar Hachochmah). That said, many copies of Josippon can be found on Hebrewbooks, e.g. the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/22156\" rel=\"noreferrer\">editio princeps</a> (can also be <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH990012683250205171/NLI\" rel=\"noreferrer\">found</a> on the NLI website). Text versions are also available on <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikitext</a> (albeit incomplete) and the <a href=\"https://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx?misyzira=702000\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maagarim</a> website.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Thank you to Harel13 for showing that the change to the Hebrew text compared to the Greek, is attested in the Talmud (various places) and has only been added to Josippon.</p>\n<p>As it happens, the text of the LXX we have DOES differ from the MT, but it is not as described in the Talmud.</p>\n<p>The text is Jacob's blessing (Gen 49). Specifically, his words to Simeon and Levi are a rebuke and a curse IMO. It appears to relate to their treacherous attack on Shechem, where they killed the men and enslaved the women. Afterwards, Jacob said: <em>You have made me a stink to the inhabitants of the land</em> (Gen 34.30).</p>\n<p>Here is the text of Gen 49.6.</p>\n<p>בְּסֹדָם אַל־תָּבֹא נַפְשִׁי בִּקְהָלָם אַל־תֵּחַד כְּבֹדִי כִּי בְאַפָּם הָרְגוּ אִישׁ וּבִרְצֹנָם עִקְּרוּ־שֽׁוֹר</p>\n<p>In their counsel let not come my soul. In their assembly let not be joined my glory. Because in their anger they killed a man. And in their self-will they hamstrung an ox. (my trans)</p>\n<p>εἰς βουλὴν αὐτῶν μὴ ἔλθοι ἡ ψυχή μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ συστάσει αὐτῶν μὴ ἐρείσαι τὰ ἥπατά μου, ὅτι ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτῶν ἀπέκτειναν ἀνθρώπους καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτῶν ἐνευροκόπησαν ταῦρον.</p>\n<p>Into their counsel let not come my soul, and to their banding-together let not be fixed my LIVERS. Because in their anger they killed MEN; and in their desire they hamstrung A BULL. (LXX, my trans)</p>\n<p>I like ἥπατά. It translates kaved liver instead of kavod glory. As the two clauses have parallel meaning, I interpret both \"my soul\" and \"my liver\" to mean \"I\", \"my life\".\nLXX pluralizes the men killed (which fits the story). MT has only one victim.\nLXX keeps singular the bull who was hamstrung. The greek word is very specific and means exactly that - to sever the sinew. Ikker is used that way in 4 other instances, but there it refers to chariot horses in war. Note that the Hebrew word more usually means \"to uproot\" and is connected with words meaning \"descendant\" and \"barren\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.9.15?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jerusalem Talmud Megilla 1.9.15</a> alleges the version presented to Ptolemy goes thus:</p>\n<p>“For in their rage they slew a bull and in their will uprooted a trough\"</p>\n<p>כִּי בְאַפָּם הָֽרְגוּ שׁוֹר וּבִרְצוֹנָם עִקְרוּ אָבוּס</p>\n<p>Evus \"trough\" connotes food and shelter - it's a shed as much as a manger. I came across it because of the greek φάτνη in Luke's infancy story, which translates it.\nAlthough there is nothing in the usage in the Hebrew bible to suggest birth - only food and shelter - I do wonder if that was a pre-existing connotation.\n(I am sticking my neck out, I know.)</p>\n<p>There is no mention, in Gen 34 (the sack of Shechem) of hamstringing livestock. In fact it says Simeon and Levi took all the livestock, which makes sense. Why spoil when you can steal?\nI think the only reason the LXX jumps to ἐνευροκόπησαν, is because of the other 4 instances, where the military logic is compelling.\nIn short, I think the more natural interpretation of the MT <em>here</em> is \"uproot\", or \"deprive of issue\".</p>\n<p>I will be honest. I think the bull shur may refer to Joseph, who was either killed and/or deprived of issue. (cf. Gen 49.22. Deut 33.7). My intuition is that there may be an older version of the sack of Shechem, which still involves Simeon and Levi, but where the victim is not Hamor but Joseph. Joseph is deeply associated with Shechem, where he is buried.\nThis would explain the curious Hosea 6.9, where a murder is committed on the road to Shechem, with priestly and robber-band connotations. I also link it to Proverbs 1:10–18.</p>\n<p>I am aware I am going out on a very long limb here. But I ask you to consider it..</p>\n<p>As for Rashi's interpretation - that killing a bull makes the Jews seem much less bloodthirsty than killing a man - I remind you that in the account we have of the sack of Shechem, they kill ALL the men. Which LXX acknowledges: ἀπέκτειναν ἀνθρώπους (pl).</p>\n<p>Killing one man and one bull is an odd way of describing the story in Gen 34. It actually makes more  sense if the man and the bull are the same. And how else to explain the curious reference to evus a manger? ...</p>\n<p>This is a speculative interpretation, which may not convince. It provides the context of the original text. It's an explanation of the Talmudic amended text (which may once have been LXX), namely \"kill a bull... ruin a crib\" (my paraphrase). It is euphemistic, because it refers to the killing or castrating of a beloved culture hero. Like all euphemisms, it is intended both to disclose (to the wise) and to keep hidden (from others).</p>\n<p>Please see Haral13's post above for the Talmud passages which attest to the altered text.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there any reason to suppose that \"Reish Lakish\" means something like \"chief of the bandits\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I feel like I've heard this many times over the years. In the last couple of days I've shopped the question around, and everyone seems to have heard the theory that because of his colorful past, Reish Lakish was so-called because it means \"chief of the bandits.\"</p>\n<p>It doesn't seem to make much sense. Jastrow doesn't list such a word, Lakish = bandit. It seems hard to reconcile with the frequently-used Shimon Ben Lakish, unless that Ben is taken to mean something like the Ben of Ben Torah. And it would seem rather strange to call him forever by reference to his former bad character which he so greatly improved. To me it seems much more natural to assume that Reish is a contraction of Rav Shimon, used just because there were a lot of Shimons to be distinguished.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, is there any source or good reason to the view that Reish Lakish means something like \"chief of the bandits\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R’ Yochanan (Bava Metzia 84a) refers to Reish Lakish as “Bar Lekisha”. The added alef seems to indicate that “Lakish” is more than just a name.</p>\n<p><em>Lekisha</em> translates as “the late one”. (See Targum Onkelos, Bereishis 30:42; Vayikra Rabbah 30:3.) This is one of the reasons the late rain is called מלקוש. Perhaps the name “Reish Lakish” alludes to his belated devotion to Torah study, dubbing him “the Latecomer” — and indeed, “the Head of the Latecomers”.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In reference to the name Reish Lakish, R.

Reish Lakish said: Those born later (<em>lakishaya</em>) were Laban’s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The name signifies he was born later to his parents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Alternatively, it seems that the nickname <em>Reish Lakish</em> of R. Shimon ben Lakish is a play on words. Lakish was the name of R. Shimon's father, and it means \"the late one\" as explained <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/145086/36610\">Yø-c Ro</a>. However, for R. Shimon the nickname was used as a hint ריש מלקה איש - <em>Reish Malkeh Ish</em> - Chief hitter of men (Thank you Harel13!), as in Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makkot.3.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 3:3</a> \" לוֹקֶה אַרְבָּעִים \" - flogged with forty lashes.</p>\n<p>We can infer the etymology as follows.

There, (among the bandits), they called me: <strong>Rabbi (literally Leader/Great Man)</strong>, and here (among Torah scholars), too, they call me: <strong>Rabbi</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The description of what R.

He took a bag and a round stone inside of it with him. He said: There is a tradition that on the final day of a captive’s life, before his captors kill him, they do for him anything that he requests of them, so that he would forgive them for the spilling of his blood. On the final day before they were set to kill him they said to him: What is amenable to you? He said to them: I want to tie you up and have you sit, and I will <strong>אֶמְחְיֵהּ/strike</strong> each one of you one and a half times. He tied them up and had each one of them sit. When he <strong>struck</strong> each of them with <strong>one strike</strong> with the stone in the bag, <strong>the one whom he struck died, because Reish Lakish was of great strength</strong>. Reish Lakish gritted his teeth in anger, and said to the one whom he killed, in order to prevent the others from realizing what was happening: Are you laughing at me? You still have half of a strike remaining with me, as I struck you only once. <em>He killed them all, and Reish Lakish escaped his captors</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Aramaic word מחי is the same as Hebrew מכה and מלקה is used in the context of מכות.</p>\n\n\n",

I'd like to expand the question. Say there's an observant Jew who unfortunately has not been that successful in his observance. He believes in the Torah, wants to keep it, but has failed on some <em>serious</em> aveiros, and has not been able to really do teshuvah on them; he knows that so far he hasn't been able to rule them out in the future. He's not a mumar, hasn't given up on them at all, doesn't want them.<br />\n<em>However</em> he has been careful never to do these kinds of things in public, and as far as the Beis Din and the community is concerned he is a completely upstanding member.<br />\n[I'm guessing that, depending on which aveirah, this kind of thing might be pretty common.]</p>\n<p>Question: Is he a kosher witness? He knows what he has done, but no one else does beside the רבונו של עולם. The Beis Din will obviously accept him - they won't even listen if he would confess! If he is called as a witness to a Kiddushin does he need to decline if he cares about the couple, or is the only important thing what the Beis Din knows about him?</p>\n<p>Maybe to illustrate the question I'll add something that I heard from a very big talmid chacham, which maybe should be a separate question. There's a she'elah on a piece of meat, and the Beis Din hears witnesses and rules it kosher. I have information that they don't that it is neveilah, and they wouldn't even believe me about it if I would have told them; say two witnesses said the opposite. In any case, I didn't say anything to anyone. Am I allowed to eat the meat?<br />\nThis talmid chacham answered me briefly: \"The Torah says you're not allowed to eat neveilah.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The problem is that there are at least three different people that this Shimon could be and from what I could find, traditional sources list him as synonymous with one of the other two.  There is Shimon haMacabee, there's Shimon the high priest who met Alexander, and there is the Shimon of Pirkei Avot.  Unfortunately, there are some sources mentioning Antigonus (his disciple) living in the second century BCE, and others saying he lived in the 4th century BCE.  If it was the former, then the identification of Shimon with Shimon haMacabee seems to be correct, but then we don't know the chain of descent from the men of the great assembly to Shimon.  This theory also goes against the common view that the nassi at the time of the chanukkah story was Yossi ben Yoezer.  The other theory, identifying Shimon HaTzadik with the Shimon that met Alexander, also doesn't make sense because then there's not enough generations in Pirkei Avot between him and Yossi ben Yoezer, and also still doesn't fix the issue of us not knowing who his teacher was, because Pirkei Avot says that he was the last of the Great Assembly, but if so, then he would have been a contemporary of Ezra, who lived around 200 years before (temple being built in the late 500s BCE).</p>\n<p>Are there any sources that perhaps mention the Great Assembly lasting for multiple generations or around 200 years?  If not, and the sources say that the Great Assembly was a one-generation thing, how do we account for the gap in time and the inconsistency of who Shimon haTzadik is?</p>\n<p>I am aware that there is a differing chronology between the Seder Olam Rabbah and the archeological evidence, and I think that the conventional chronology makes more sense (Seder Olam can be interpreted non-literally, so meshing the two isn't an issue for me), so how do we account for a seeming glaring gap in teachers?</p>\n<p>Edit: I also came across an opinion by Rabbi Ishmael that there was roughly 700 years between the destructions of the temples, which seems to line up more with the conventional chronology, but Rabbi Ishmael doesn't break down how he calculated everything and who the leaders in each generation were, so we still have the same issue I asked about above.</p>\n\n\n",

He then argues and explains differently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כי נפש הוא חובל</strong> – כי בו מחית נפשות,\nוהסומכים על הסמך הפרשיות איננה טענה, כי כל מצו' עומדת בפני עצמה והסמיכות כדרך דרש. וזאת הפרש' דבקה, כי הזכיר שלא יגזול ענבים לתת אל כליו וחרמש בקמה, ולקחת אשה והיתה לו גם לאחר ויצא מרשותו, והלוקח אשה שישמח בה לא יהיה עשוק שיצא בצבא. וחביל' הרחים עושק וגם גונב נפש, וכן נגע הצרעת שלא ישמרו משפטיה תזיק הקרובים, וכן לא תעשוק העני בעבוטו והשכיר, והבנים הקטנים שלא ימותו בעון אביהם, והטיית משפט גר יתום וחבול בגד אלמנה, ושכחה בשדה כי היא לעני, וכן לא תעולל וכן פן יוסיף ונקלה, וחסימת השור עשק כי יגע ולא יאכל, והממאן ליבם כדמות עשק, והמחזקת במבושים עושקת, אבן ואבן איפה ואיפה עשק ממש, גם עמלק עשק לישראל:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>For he taketh a man's life to pledge</strong> – For life is sustained by these instruments. Those who rely on the juxtaposition of the sections have no argument, <em>(That our verse speaks metaphorically of sexual intercourse.)</em> for each commandment stands by itself. <em>(The commandments are not necessarily tied together. Each commandment is an independent unit.)</em> The explanation of their juxtapositions is midrashic. <em>(It therefore cannot be used as a reason to interpret a law metaphorically when the plain meaning of the text is acceptable.)</em> This section <em>(The law regarding taking a mill to pledge.)</em> is connected to the previous ones in the following way: <em>(That is, if we want to connect this section midrashically to what comes before, we can so in the following manner.)</em> the Torah mentions that one is not to steal grapes by putting them in his pots (Deut. 23:25), or to lift up a sickle upon his neighbor’s grain (Deut. 23:26); or to take a woman after she has been his and then left his house and married another (v. 1). It also states that one has to cheer the woman whom he marries (v. 5); he is not to be oppressed by going into the army (Ibid.). The taking of a millstone in pledge is a form of oppression. <em>(Hence the positioning of our law.)</em> So too is kidnapping a person. Similarly the plague of leprosy, for if he does not observe its laws then the plague will injure those in proximity to it. <em>(By infecting them.)</em> Scripture similarly states, do not oppress a poor person by taking a pledge from him (v. 10). It similarly states do not oppress a hired person (v. 14) and small children should not be put to death for the sins of the fathers (v. 16). It likewise warns against perverting the justice due a stranger or the fatherless (v. 17). It prohibits the taking of a widow’s garment as a pledge (v. 17). It prohibits one from retrieving a sheaf which was forgotten in the field, for it belongs to the poor (v. 19). Similarly Thou shalt not glean (v. 21). Likewise lest if he should exceed…Then thy brother should be dishonored (Deut. 25:3). <em>(Deut. 25:3 prohibits the infliction of more that 40 stripes to one being punished by lashes. Exceeding this number of stripes is a form of oppression.)</em> The muzzling of an ox (v. 4) is an act of oppression, for the animal toils but cannot eat of its toil. Similarly, refusing to perform levirate marriage (Deut. 25:5-10) is a form of oppression. The woman who grabs a man’s testicles (Deut. 25:11) commits an act of oppression. Employing diverse weights and diverse measures (Deut. 25:13,14) is oppression in its purest form. Furthermore, Amalek oppressed Israel (Deut. 25:17-19). <em>(Thus the laws in Deut. 23:25-25:19 are thematically related. Hence the law prohibiting the taking of a mill was included in this section.)</em> (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Guggenheimer</a>, here's a quote with some modifications for readability:</p>\n<p>\"In most <em><strong>French</strong></em> manuscripts and sources the reading (of excerpt from Seder Olam chapter 1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our forefather Yitzchak was 37 years old when he was bound to the altar (Bereshis 21:34)...At that time Rivka was born. It follows that Yitzchak married Rivka when she was 3 years old\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a few (French manuscripts) we find reading \"<strong>4 years</strong>\". Some Oriental-Sephardic manuscripts have reading \"<strong>14 years</strong>\".</p>\n<p>The reading \"3 years\" is quoted by Rashi on Bereshis 25:20 (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/145124/36610\">Rabbi Kaii's answer</a>) and Tosafos Yebamos 61b (s.v. וכן), who write \"Seder Olam teaches explicitly that she was 3 years old when Yitzhak married her and it is impossible to emend the text since we read there: 'Our forefather Yitzchak was 37 years of age when he was bound to the altar and at that time, 'Rivka was born' and it is written (Bereshis 25:20) 'Yitzchak was 40 years old when he married Rivka.'\" Once one accepts the reading \"37 years\" ..., the unlikely conclusion that Rivka went out alone to fetch water at the age of 3 seems inescapablle.</p>\n<p>The reading \"4 years\" can also be explained the same way: Abraham was informed of Rivka's birth on his return from Mount Moriah, so Rivka can be assumed to be born in the preceding year. This argument does not violate any of Rabbi Yose (b. Chalafta) principles (that Scripture does not come to hide but to explain). But if we accept the reading \"37 years\" (for Yitzchak), it seems better to accept also the reading \"3 years\" (for Rivka), not only because of the overriding authority of Rashi and Tosafos, who accept the reading, but also as we have seen before (in the commentary to the midrash), that R. Yose accepts the opinion of R. Yehoshua, that the years start in Nissan, and the patriarchs and matriarchs were born in Nissan. The tradition that the Akkeida on Mount Moriah was on the 1st day of Tishrei; there seems no dissent to this opinion. Therefore the messenger would have more than 6 months (to travel) from Charan to Beer Sheva. In addition, Rashi is a very careful reader of manuscripts, who never hesitates to point out readings he finds questionable.</p>\n<p>But nevertheless it is difficult to accept the reading \"3 years\". The text \"at that time Rivka was born\" is found in all manuscripts, whether ashkenazic, Sephardic, or Oriental. The text is the base for computation \"3 years\" as explained. On the other hand, none of the Galilean <em>midrashim</em> has any trace of an opinion that Rivka married as a toddler. Also Talmud Bavli Yebamos 61b is clearly of the opinion that Rivka married as <em>na'arah</em>, a girl in her puberty, who legally is no longer a minor but has not yet acquired the status of an independent adult. This also seems to be implied by the legal language of the verse Bereshis 24:16. The Talmud (loc. cit.) has difficulties with reconciling the rule, derived from Bereshis 16:3, that a couple after 10 years of childless marriage is obliged to seek ways to have a child with the fact (Bereshis 25:20,26) that Yitzchak waited 20 years after his marriage before he was roused to activity. If Rivka actually was only 3 years of age, the first nine years of her marriage would not count since, for a minor, any pregnancy is a hazard to her health or life (Yebamos 12b). However, the Talmud, which otherwise follows Seder 'Olam very strictly, does not choose this easy way out but instead insists that Yitzchak was sterile during the first ten years of his marriage.</p>\n<p>In addition, R. Yose (ben Chalafta) is quoted in Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer (Chapter 32) saying \"3 years did Isaac mourn his mother. After 3 years he married Rebecca and forgot the mourning for his mother,\" without mentioning that he had to wait anyhow since 3 years is the minumum age after which a father can marry off his daughter. Similarly, the Gallilean Bereshit Rabba (57:2) mentions that \"after these happenings\" (Bereshis 22:20) of the 'Akkeidah, Abraham realized that he should find a mate for Yitzchak and was informed of Rivka's existence, without insisting that it was a notice of her birth. In fact, as explained ..., the notice that Abraham received from his family was <em>a notification of his father's death</em>, with the notices on his brother's children being incidental. <em>Therefore, it seems clear that one should accept the reading \"<strong>14 years</strong>\" as the original reading of Seder 'Olam, as given in <strong>Oriental - Sephardic manuscripts</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The Tosafos themselves (Yebamos 61b) give the following argument: \"Rebbi Sh'muel (ben Kalonymos) the Pious of Speyer proved that Rivka was 14 years old since it is stated in Sifri (Devarim # 357, cf. also Bereshis Rabba 100:10): <em>6 couples lived the same number of years, and among them Kehas (son of Levi) and Rivka. Kehas lived 133 years as given by Scripture</em> (Shemos 6:18), and if Rivka was 14 at the time of her marriage then the computations come out right. When Yaacov was born she was then 34 years of age and Yaakov was 99 years old when his mother died (see Seder Olam Chapter 2), that makes 133 years. For Yaakov was 63 years old when he received his father's blessing (Seder 'Olam Chapter 2), 14 years he hid in the house of Ever (loc. cit., Megillah 17a), 20 years in Laban's house (Bereshis 31:38), 2 years he spent on the road (Seder 'Olam Chapter 2), and at that time Rivka died (Seder 'Olam Chapter 2), as we explain, based on Bereshis rabba 81:5, Koheles rabba 7:2, Tanchuma Teitze 4, Tanchuma Buber Vayishlah 26, Pesiqta d'Rav Kahana Zakhor 24a: \"(Bereshis 35:8) <em>allon bakhut</em>, aλλov בכות <em>another crying</em>, two mournings,one for Rivka and the other one for her wet nurse (Devorah); for a total of 99 years. One has to assume there are different midrashic traditions.\"</p>\n<p>We even know that not Rebbi Sh'muel the Pious is the author of the argument but Rebbi Eliezer ben Nathan of Mayence / Maynz, known as RAVa\"N (Responsa, #118). He reports to have been asked by Rebbi Sh'muel ben Kalonymos about the source for the assertion that Rivka's life was equal in length to that of Kehas \"and I answered him, it is taught in Seder 'Olam: At the time of the 'Akkeidah, Rivka was born and was married to Yitzchak at age 4, and Devorah the wet-nurse of Rivka died (Bereshis 35:8) together with Rivka, and if you compute from the 'Akkeidah to the death of Devorah you will find only 123 years and she would have lived 10 years less than Kehas. But certainly, the author of Sifri disagrees with the author of Seder 'Olam and in his opinion she was 10 years old at the time of the 'Akkeidah and was married at age 14, or also he might be of the opinion that she was born at the time of the 'Akkeidah but he does not accept that she died at the same time as her wet-nurse but lived another 10 years and the entire statement is a tradition (not supported by Scripture).\" His interpretation is accepted by the later French commentator Chizkuni (Bereshis 25:20) as based on the correct reading of Seder 'Olam \"14 years.\"</p>\n<p>As explained in the introduction (of the commentary), it seems that Seder 'Olam is a <em>Babylonian</em> compilation of the school of Rav, based on Rebbi Yose's material. There are also good reasons to accept the attribution of the editing of Sifri to the same school. Therefore, it is most reasonable to accept the reading that Isaac was 26 years old at the time of the 'Akkeidah and Rivka was married at age 14 as the original Babylonian text. This is also the <em>opinion</em> of C.J. Milikowski.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To answer the question:</p>\n<p><strong>Opinion 1</strong> (French manuscripts of Seder Olam Rabba according to Rashi). Rivka was born at the time of Akkeida which was also the time of Sarah's death. She was 3 years old when she married Yitzchak, who was 40 at the time of the marriage. Abraham was 137 years at the time of Akkeidah, since he was 100 when Yitzchak was born.</p>\n<p><strong>Opinion 2</strong> (Oriental-Sephardic manuscripts of Seder Olam Rabba). Rivka was born at the time of Akkeida. Rivka was 14 when she married Yitzchak. Thus, she was born 11 years prior to Sarah's death. In other words, Yitzchak was 26 years old at the time of  the Akkeidah and Abraham was 126 years old then. Sarah imeinu died 11 years later.</p>\n<p>The opinion that Sarah died because of the Akkeidah comes from a later Rabbi Yose (Bereshis Rabba 58:5). There is a manuscript of Seder Olam stating that \"Our father Yitzchak was 26 years old when he was bound to the altar.\" This reading was also proposed by the Vilna Gaon.</p>\n<p><strong>Opinion 3</strong>.  Sifri Devarim as explained by Rebbi Eliezer ben Nathan of Mayence and Rebbi Sh'muel (ben Kalonymos) the Pious of Speyer. Rivka was born 11 years prior to the time of Akkeida, which also was the time of Sarah's death. Rivka was 14 when she married Yitzchak, who was 40 at the time of the marriage. Abraham was 137 years at the time of Akkeidah, since he was 100 when Yitzchak was born. Thus, he was 126 years old when Rivka was born.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I also heard that there could be a reconciliation between all these opinions based on mysticism (most likely source Or haChaim, but I did not see it there). As we know, Sarah, mother of Yitzchak died 3 years prior to Rivka's marriage. Perhaps, a part of Sarah's soul at that time was given to Rivkah. Thus, one can say that as Rivkalah, daughter of Bethuel haArami, she was 14 when she married Yitzchak. However, as a girl with potential of Rivka imeinu she was only 3 or 4 years.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where does Jewish Oral Tradition address the duration of the enslavement of Israel in Egypt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/a/13496/97052\">an answer on Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange</a> addressing the duration of Israel's enslavement in Egypt, user <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/11567/\">conceptualinertia</a> writes,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gal[atians] 3:16-17 [a reference to a passage in the Christian New Testament] is line with the Oral Tradition (that Orthodox Jews believe provides authoritative interpretation of the Old Testament). Abraham is told that his children will sojourn in \"a land that is is not their own\" for 400 years (Genesis 15:13). Egypt is not specified and neither is it clear that the suffering and enslavement would last the full 400 years (in the cantorial notes there is full stop, which functions like a semi-colon) before the words \"400 years\"). The Jewish tradition understands the 400 years to begin with the birth of Isaac who was always a sojourner, moving from place to place and never governing land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which sources in the Jewish Oral Tradition discuss relation between 400 years and the duration of the Egyptian exile?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The primary source for these calculations is Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabba, chapter 3</a>. Unfortunately the translation on Sefaria is wrong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was said to our forefather Abraham at the Covenant Between the Pieces (Gen. 15:13): \"You shall certainly know that your seed will be strangers in a foreign land for 400 years.\" Who is the seed? That is Isaac, of whom it is said (Gen. 21:12): \"Because Isaac will be called seed for you.\" About Isaac it says (Gen. 25:26): \"Isaac was 60 years of age when they were born.\" Our forefather Jacob said to Pharaoh (Gen. 47:9): \"The days of the years of my wandering are 130 years\". This makes together 190 years, this leaves 210 years, a sign for the lifetime of Job who was born at that time as it is said (Job 42:16): \"Job lived  thereafter 140 years\" and it is said (Job 42:10): \"The Eternal added double to all that Job had\". It turns out that Job was born when Israel descended to Egypt and he died when they left.</p>\n<p>Or maybe that Israel was in Egypt the full 400 years? But Kehat was among those who entered Egypt (Gen. 46:11) and it is written (Ex. 6:18): \"the years of the life of Kehat were 133 years,\" (Ex. 6:20) \"the years of the life of Amram 137 years.\" Together with 80 years of Moses this makes 350 years. What\ndoes Scripture teach us in the verse (Gen. 15:13) \"they will enslave them and mistreat them for 400 years\" that all the time they spent in a land that was not theirs adds up to 400 years; \"they will enslave them\" (these are the years of slavery) \"and mistreat them\" (these are the years of deprivation) and\nall of them together add up to 400 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The commentary provides futher details as to how these numbers are reconciled between different texts. It can also be added to the answer.</p>\n\n\n",

The planet has a 20 hour day and takes around 520 days to orbit the sun. How would Shabbat happen in that case? I'm guessing the Jewish calendar itself would remain unchanged in terms of the chagim.

Nosson Dovid Rabinowich the expression תא שמע can have 3 different uses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To show that a <em>Memra</em>, a reported teaching, opinion or decision of the Amoraim, is in conflict with a Mishna or Baraisa (i.e. a Tannaic statement).</li>\n<li>To provide a solution to a problem בעיה.</li>\n<li>To introduce an argument or difficulty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason, why there are such different uses, is explained in the <a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/practical-talmud-dictionaryhardcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Practical Talmudic Dictionary</a> by R. Yitzchak Frank: the expression תא שמע introduces  a mishna, a baraitha, a pasuk, or an early amora's statement or practice that is <em>quoted</em>.

Rabinowich, as a refutation תא שמע slightly differs from מיתיבי. The word מיתיבי is only used synonymosly to introduce a refutation (תיובתא) of an amoraic statement based on higher authority of undisputed Mishna or Baraitha.

It invites scrutiny, examination, discourse, questions and answers, splitting hairs, finding distinctions, finding supporting analogies, etc. That way of thinking  has been admired by the non Talmudic world as being responsible for Jewish brains, acumen, and overall \"out of the box\" thinking.</p>\n\n\n",

Once he realized this, he said, “אין הדבר תלוי אלא בי” — “It all depends on me — the responsibility is totally mine!” He then put his head between his knees and cried until he died after which a bas kol (heavenly voice) emerged from shamayim and declared, “Rebbi Elazer ben Durdaya is worthy of Olam Habbah.”</p>\n<p>The question is that we only find one has to be moser nefesh for the big three; idol worship, immorality and murder (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah - Yesodei HaTorah 5:2</a>), so how can Rav Chaim Volozhiner now add in teshuva as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's another example of this, in regards to learning Torah.  In Brachos 61b, we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbis taught:  One time the Evil Empire decreed that the Jews may\nnot learn Torah.  Papus ben Yehudah found Rabbi Akiva teaching Torah\nto large crowds.  He asked him:  Akiva, aren't you frightened of the\nEmpire?  Rabbi Akiva responded: I will provide you a parable.  One\ntime there was a fox walking alongside a river, and he saw fishes\nswimming from one spot to another.  He asked them:  What are you\nfleeing?  And they answered:  We flee the fishermen and their nets!\nResponded the fox:  Do you want to come up on the dry land and live\ntogether with me, as my ancestors and your ancestors once dwelt\ntogether?  Answered the fishes:  Are you the one that I call the\ncleverest of all beasts?  You are not clever--you are a fool!  In the\nplace where we can live we are afraid, in the place where we must die\nhow much more so!  The same is true of us.  We sit and learn Torah,\nabout which the verse says 'For it is your life and the length of your\ndays' and we are afraid--if we would stop learning Torah, how much\nmore so!  They said:  Not much later, they arrested Rabbi Akiva and\nimprisoned him, and they arrested Papus ben Yehuda and imprisoned him\ntogether with Rabbi Akiva.  He said:  Papus, who brought you here?  He\nresponded:  How fortunate are you, Akiva, that you wre seized for the\nsake of Torah--and woe to Papup, who was seized for the sake of\nworthless things.  When they took Rabbi Akiva out to execute him, it\nwas the time of Krias Shema, and they were scraping off his flesh with\niron scrapers, and he recited Krias Shema and accepted Hashem's\nKingdom.  His disciples asked him:  Our teacher, how can you be so\nfocused?  He responded:  All my life I was worried about the verse of\n\"And with all your soul,\" meaning \"even if He takes your soul.\"  Now\nthat it has come to me, shall I not fulfill it?  He extended his\nrecitation of the word \"One,\" and his soul left him as he pronounced\nit.  A Heavenly Voice declared:  You are fortunate, Rabbi Akiva, and\nyou are invited to the life of the World to Come!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How was Rabbi Akiva allowed to give up his life for the sake of Torah?  Notice that he does not argue that it is a time of shemad, and then one must give up his life for any mitzvah; he provides a lengthy parable to emphasize the uniqueness of Torah.</p>\n<p>I would suggest to you that when it comes to a one-off sin, even the most terrible, the sinner can potentially rebuild his connection to Hashem afterwards.   Even if he committed idolatry, arayos, or murder, he can come close again afterwards.  Therefore, with regards to those issurim, I could well have thought that one should not give his life rather than transgress.</p>\n<p>However, if we stop learning Torah, there is no possibility of having any connection to Hashem.  And if we cannot do Teshuva, there is no possibility of any connection to Hashem.  Therefore, when it comes to these mitzvos, it is obvious that one must pay any price in order to fulfill them, up to an including giving his life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.61b.7?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 61b</a></p>\n\n\n",

I do not believe he ever drinks from the bekher himself.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Minhag Breslev is to recite kiddish over a koss containing 3 revyisn of wine and drink one revyis on Friday night leaving the (covered) koss with the remaining two revyisn on the table for Shabess (one revyis for the morning kiddish and one for the havduleh). Some use smaller cups each time. Mind that the mekadesh must drink from the koss, unless he has some health issues or be a nozir, in which case he may delegate his kiddish wine to someone who heard his kiddish, provided they are above 6 years of age.</p>\n<p>As for women you might like to check out Magen Avruhom on S\"A O\"Ch 271. Specifically, in 271:2 he states: \"Women are obligated in Kiddush, even though it is a positive commandment that time causes, because זכור is compared to שמור. And these women, since they are included in שמירה, they are included in זכירה. And they can discharge men (from their obligation) since they are obligated מן התורה like them.\" This probably refers to those women who haven't prayed mayrev, which might be the case.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if the ownership of the koss makes any difference for the established custom. So, probably, your maggid knows that in terms of kabboleh the koss represents Malchess (while wine is Daas) and the woman is also Malchess  (while the man is Zayr Anpin), so it seems like a very weird zivveg? But this is not minhag Breslev.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don’t think this has so much to do with a Chassidic minhag but rather Halacha.</p>\n<p>If the one making kiddish drinks from the kiddish cup, it’s becomes pagum and so someone else can’t drink from it an be yotzei Kiddush (according to all opinions) <strong>in the best possible way</strong> without “fixing” the kos (by adding more wine). This is because strictly speaking, a person only needs to listen to kiddish to be yotzei Kiddush but there are opinions that state to be “makom kiddish” one has to eat or drink something and by drinking from the Kiddush wine one makes a better connection with the meal that is about to follow.</p>\n<p>This is the relevant Halacha regarding pagum</p>\n<p>שולחן ערוך הרב אורח חיים סימן קפ״ב</p>\n<p>סעיף ד׳</p>\n<p>\"כוס של ברכה צריך שלא יהא פגום,\nובא שנתן מימיה וישתה ממנה — פגום. ואפילו לא הביא אליו את פיו אלא שפך לתוך פיו. אבל אם שפך ממנו לתוך ידו או לתוך כלי ושתה — אין בכך כלום.\"</p>\n<p>סעיף ה׳</p>\n<p>\"כוס פגום יכולים לתקנו על ידי שיוסיפו עליה מעט יין,\n… וכך מתקן.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Schmidt also included an artistic discussion of the page, suggesting that the page represents</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"a visual construct of the idea of God occupying the heavens above.

Why would some chazanim avoid making these repetitions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are many melodies written for the paragraph beginning \"Vay'hi Binsoa\", but by far the most common one is by Salomon Sulzer. Interestingly, his setting is in his Yom Tov section of his book; he has a different Shabbat setting that no one uses.</p>\n<p>He does indeed repeat the phrase כִּי מִצִּיּון תֵּצֵא תורָה twice. It's hard to infer exactly what his intent was here, but suffice to say it is a classic example of a sequence ascending by a tone, which is a typical compositional technique, and is pleasing to the ear as we recognise what we've already heard.</p>\n<p>But Sulzer's melody stops at \"Mirushalayim\" and does not have anything written for בָּרוּךְ שֶׁנָּתַן תּורָה. So what you hear in North American congregations where the same melody from כִּי מִצִּיּון is applied to this verse is a later adaptation that Sulzer never wrote. I have heard some Rabbis and Chazzanim are opposed to this repetition of the word Torah for theological reasons, but know that it was never part of the original composition.</p>\n<p>Outside of North America, it is more common to attach on a different, rising ending for בָּרוּךְ שֶׁנָּתַן תּורָה which actually comes from an earlier traditional melody. You can hear that full composition here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mGm22rCCnIA?si=8gghQvz_LrNhVZwM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/mGm22rCCnIA?si=8gghQvz_LrNhVZwM</a></p>\n\n\n",

How does this fit with the belief that the scriptures are inerrant, especially since this passage seems to make perfect sense with its plain meaning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You misunderstand the text.  Let's take a look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Lord said to Abraham: Why is it that Sarah laughed, saying: Shall\nI indeed bear a child, and I have grown old?” (Genesis 18:13).  “The\nLord said to Abraham: Why is it that Sarah laughed, saying: [Shall I\nindeed bear a child, and I have grown old?]” – bar Kappara said: Peace\n[between spouses] is a great thing, as even Scripture spoke untruths\nin order to establish peace between Abraham and Sarah. “Sarah laughed\nto herself, saying: After my languishing, shall I have youth, and my\nhusband is old?” But He did not say this to Abraham, but rather, “Why\nis it that Sarah laughed, saying: Shall I indeed bear a child, and I\nhave grown old?” The verse does not say as Sarah said: “My husband is\nold,” but rather, “I have grown old.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Medrash notes that Hashem deliberately misreported Sarah's comments to Avraham.  Whereas she had commented that her husband, Avraham, was old, Hashem told Avraham that she had said that she herself was old.  This was not an error on His part, nor an error on the part of the Torah as to what He said.  He said this, and He said it intentionally.  The purpose was to uphold marital peace between Avraham and Sarah, as Avraham might feel offended if he heard that his wife regarded him as elderly.</p>\n<p>Again, when Sarah heard that she would yet have a child, she said \"How can this be?  My husband is too old.\"</p>\n<p>When Hashem discussed this with Avraham, He said that Sarah had said \"How can this be?  I am too old.\"</p>\n<p>Chazal note the discrepancy, and explain that Hashem is here teaching us that it is correct behavior to tell \"white lies\" in order to maintain peace between people, particularly between married couples.</p>\n\n\n",

Sefer HaChinuch in his discussion of each <em>mitzvah</em> tells you into which category a particular <em>mitzvah</em> falls.</p>\n<p>If someone fails to perform a <em>mitzvat asei</em> that he is obligated to do (whether we're talking about something completely obligatory like <em>shofar</em>, or a person who puts on a a four-cornered garment and so is now obligated to attach <em>tzitzit</em>) it seems clear that such a person has committed \"an <em>aveirah</em>\" and would be liable to receive heavenly punishment.</p>\n<p>For example, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.86a.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 86a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עָבַר עַל עֲשֵׂה וְשָׁב — אֵינוֹ זָז מִשָּׁם עַד שֶׁמּוֹחֲלִין לוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים שׁוֹבָבִים״</p>\n<p>If one violates a positive mitzva and repents, he is forgiven even before he moves from his place, i.e. immediately, as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which certainly sounds like he can expect some form of punishment if he does not repent (or at the very least has done something wrong which needs atonement).</p>\n<p>Possibly even more instructive, in terms of the terminology you are using, is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Yoma.86a.7.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's comment</a> there, in reference to <em>mitzvat asei</em> (my emphases):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למדת שיש <strong>עבירה</strong> שמכפרת בתשובה לבדה</p>\n<p>Thus, there is <strong>an <em>aveirah</em></strong> for which <em>teshuvah</em> alone atones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, in the context of your statement that \"there are always <em>mitvos asei</em> that you could be doing\", it's worth noting that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HaChinukh%2C_Opening_Letter_by_the_Author.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch in his epistle</a> lists precisely four <em>mitzvot asei</em> (along with two <em>mitzvot lo taaseh</em>) that are incumbent upon us at all times, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to believe in God</li>\n<li>to conceive of His oneness</li>\n<li>to love Him</li>\n<li>to fear Him</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Just to expand on Joel K's excellent answer...</p>\n<p>There are essentially 5 categories of Mitzvot Asei:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Issur Asei\" - a sin which has been phrased in the Torah as a positive action, yet reflects a prohibition (as understood by Chaza\"l). For example, Leviticus 21:13 - <em>a Kohen Gadol must marry a virgin</em> is understood as a prohibition to marry a non-virgin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Eating outside the Sukka on Sukkot <em>may</em> be another example. Wearing a four-cornered garment without tzitit too, but this is similarly subject to dispute. see Tosafot Yevamot 90b, s.v. Kulhu)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Once-per-lifetime Asei - For example, brit milah. (There is a debate (Rambam/Ra'avad) if this Asei is transgressed retroactively at death, or if the transgressor <em>lives in sin</em> until he has circumcision, at which point the transgression is absolved.) Another example is P'ru U'rvu, where if one's children die, Ch\"V, before them, they have not fulfilled the mitzva.</li>\n<li>A Time-or-situation-bound Asei - A Mitzvah with a set and limited time frame to fulfil. For example, listening to shofar or bringing a korban pesach.  Allowing this time frame or obligation to pass without fulfilling the mitzva is a sin, albeit one without action.</li>\n<li>A voluntary Asei - A mitzva which carries no obligation to fulfil - sort of extra credit, if you like. (The delineation between this category and the previous category is sometimes unclear, and we have to rely on Chazal, Rishonim or other commentators to help define each mitzva.) For example, Shiluach Haken.</li>\n<li>A \"facilitative Asei\" - An Asei which technically offers no reward, yet permits actions that would have been forbidden otherwise. For example, Shechita.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Kotzeker Rebbe z'y's used to say: \"Even the greatest tzadik, who has never sinned, must pray to the Aybershter that he NOT come to believe in himself, for his self-grandeur is worse than the worst aveyreh.\"</p>\n<p>You see, a good yid lives between the open arms of Tohoreh and Kedisheh, which have various manifestations, e.g. haircut, tefillin, wine, mikveh and their absence respectively. And the general rule is: מעלין בקודש ואינם מורידים (one ought to rise in holiness and never retreat), e.g. if you go nozir, you gain in kedisheh, but if you interrupt it, you're called a sinner (although you might have been a tzadik before your neziress).</p>\n<p>So, there's a certain hierarchy of Kedisheh, e.g. from chol to shabes and up to yom kipper. But internally, it depends on the state of your soul, which your body supports. Therefore, in ideal your physical acts must reflect your spiritual image, e.g. if once's mind is dirty, one is exempt from tefillin. If instead one's mind is pure and it's time for tefillin, then not wearing it damages one's image, which is not an aveireh in itself, but only in relation to the Aybershter, in Whose holy image a Ben Maylech was created.</p>\n<p>As you say, one just cannot be holy 24/7 and that's the reason why there's Tohoreh. You kinda kosherise yourself over and over again in mikveh, toyreh, tfilleh in order to maintain your status as His holy vessel. So kedisheh is something objective (like possession), while tohoreh is something subjective (like lost-and-found aka teshiveh), which depends on you and your environment.</p>\n<p>Der Kotzker Rebbe z'y'a also used to say: \"If you haven't got a talless, wrap yourself in the four corners of the earth and pray.\" The truth of the matter is that as a yid deep inside you always know when, where and even why there is or isn't an aveyreh in your performing or not performing a mitzveh. The soul is what really matters, because it belongs to the Aybershter.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is \"giving nachat ruach\" to Hashem not considered \"giving to Him\" or \"Him receiving from us\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a theme throughout all Torah thought, that we cannot give to Hashem. He is perfect and lacking nothing; He needs nothing; He has no desire to receive; He cannot receive; we have nothing to give.</p>\n<p>There are many angles, but they all seem to agree on one thing: God can't receive from us and it's very silly, or ignorant, or heretical to say so.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Baal_HaSulam%27s_Introduction_to_Zohar.7.2?lang=he&with=Translations&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a quick example from the Baal HaSulam's Introduction to the Zohar</a> to get the ball rolling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועתה שידענו בבירור שמחשבת הבריאה שהיא בכדי להנות לנבראיו, בראה בהכרח\nמידת 'רצון לקבל' ממנו ית' את כל הנועם והטוב הזה שחשב בעדם. הנה הרצון\nלקבל הזה, ודאי שלא היה כלול בעצמותו ית' מטרם שבראו בנשמות, <strong>כי ממי\nיקבל</strong>? הרי שברא דבר מחודש <strong>שאינו בו ית׳</strong>.</p>\n<p>We now also know, that the Thought of Creation was to benefit those that were created. Hashem had to\ncreat something completely new, not found in Himself. This\n\"something\" is the desire to receive all His goodness and delight. This desire to receive is\nnot found in G-d Himself, because <strong>from whom should He receive</strong>? It is created new, <strong>since the desire to\nreceive is not found in G-d Himself</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, giving Hashem <em>nachat ruach</em> (pleasure, satisfaction) through our service seems to be just as uncontroversial. We say it every day in Shacharit, quoting Rabbi Yehuda the Tanna. In the very same works that we are told Hashem does not receive from us, we are told that we give Him <em>nachat ruach</em>. Same sources as above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל ידי עסק המצוות מי\"ג שנים ואילך, שעוסק על מנת להשפיע נחת רוח ליוצרו</p>\n<p>And through his involvement in mitzvot beginning at thirteen, for the\npurpose of giving satisfaction to His Creator</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>My question: what reconciliations are given to this seeming contradiction? <strong>Why is the concept(s) of \"giving <em>nachat ruach</em>\" or \"Hashem getting <em>nachat ruach</em>\" possible, if He can't receive/we can't give Him anything?</strong></p>\n<p>I am looking for answers from any place. I would love to hear multiple reconcilations coming from various schools of thought, even opposing schools.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Necessarily, there is some reason for creation, otherwise there would be nothing rather than something (unless you posit that it derives from the divine will—sans reason—which I have a hard time wrapping my head around).</p>\n<p>The source you cite explains it as God's desire to bestow good onto others.</p>\n<p>That reason, which some would term a 'need', is somehow part of the divine perfection (as in, e.g., a perfect being necessarily provides goodness to others).</p>\n<p>As mitzvos can be seen as enabling us to fully experience that good, they in turn can be seen as providing pleasure to HaShem—not per se, but indirectly—as they allow Him to realize the purpose of creation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Meaning of \"Av Harachamim\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Time-sensitive question (today is 29 Elul..!)</p>\n<p>Artscroll translates the phrase \"Av Harachamim\" as \"father of mercy\".</p>\n<p>What does this mean exactly? How can G-d be the Father of a Midah (character trait)?</p>\n<p>Is it analogous to the phrase, \"he was the father of modern medicine\" (father meaning \"founder\" or \"progenitor\")? What would that mean exactly anyway?</p>\n<p>Or does it perhaps mean something like \"paragon\"?</p>\n<p>Sources for any answers requested, the older the better.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is similar to our blessing of גומל חסדים טובים (bestows beneficient kindnesses) in a multifold form, so is אב הרחמים - a father of multifold mercies. Perhaps, it is connected to the fact that grammatically speaking, both main names of Hashem - <em>E-lohim</em> and <em>A-donai</em> - are plural of the forms (<em>E-loah</em> and <em>A-doni</em>).</p>\n<p>The language of <em>father</em> comes from the midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbati%2C_Parashat_Vayishlach.12?vhe=Jerusalem,_1940&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabbati Vayishlach 12</a> on Bereshis 33:3 \"and he (Yaakov) himself went on ahead of (his wives and children to greet Eisav)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(<em>my translation may need correction</em>) The verse Tehilim 103:13: <em>Like a father has mercy for his children, (so the LORD has mercy for those who fear Him)</em>. Our rabbis said that so taught Yoav to David, as he said that he wondered if really a father is more merciful to his children than their mother. Is not she greatly merciful to them as she troubles herself with pregnancy, birth, and raising them? And he (David) said yes, but did not give a fitting answer. So Yoav went to find out to see whether the saying is true and what it means. He encircled entire land of Israel and found one elderly man among many and who had 12 sons and who could provide for their needs with difficulty with earnings of his entire day. Yoav asked him if he would sell him one of the sons and this way he would provide for his wife and other children. The man scolded him. So Yoav went to his wife and spoke to her at lenghth and at the end he bought a son from her for a 100 gold dinars. In the late evening the elderly man came home to eat and did not find one son. He asked where he was. His wife spoke so and so and in a roundabout way showed him 100 dinars. The man understood what happened, he became very angry and did not sleep entire night. In the morning he rose, took those dinars, he took his weapons in his hands and went to find the big man (<em>gavra</em>) who bought his son. The elderly man did not ask details (of the sale) and did not weigh the money until he found Yoav. So he said to him, \"I will not be adding to complete the payment, but if you will not retun my son either I will kill you or you will kill me\". Yoav heard the man, he took the money and returned his son. So Yoav said: indeed David said correctly: \"Like a father has mercy on his children and not like a mother has mercy on her children. Such is a fact, the mother would sell me her son so that she would not be working as hard to provide for her children, but the father exerted himself in providing for the family and was ready to sacrifice himself to kill for his son. That is what it means \"like a father has mercy on his children\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If not, why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The wilderness of Paran was in the south-west of Eretz Israel (Sinai Peninsula) or South of Israel (in the west of the Arabian Peninsula). It was one of the places of travels of Jewish people during their 40 years travels in the desert. The land of Ashur is to the East of Syria or in the North-East of Eretz Israel. The simple reading of the area of dwelling of Ishmaelites should include Eretz Israel. In the ancient world the road from Egypt or Western Arabia to Mesopotamia was going through Eretz Israel or lands of Edom, Moav and Ammon.  King Yoshiyahu unsuccessfully tried to prevent pharaoh Neco from going to fight with the Assyrian army on the river Euphrates (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.23.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melakhim B 23:29</a>). Neither Eretz Israel, Ammon, Moav, Edom, Midian, or Syria were inheritance of Ishmael. We must conclude that Ishmael's descendands were nomadic people originating in the wilderness of Paran and moving with their cattle on unsettled lands along the Southern or Eastern borders of countries of Levant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"should\" is the wrong verb. There is no language of the specific land of Paran being given to Ishmael in the sense that Eretz Yisroel and Mt. Seir were given to the Jews and the Edomites.</p>\n\n\n",

A deep analysis made by Rabbi Laufer in the book \"<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/rendezvous-with-godhardcoverstandard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rendezvous with G-d</a>\" draws strong parallels between experience of the Jewish people at the moment of Giving of the Torah at Sinai and the <em>minhagim</em> of Rosh Hashanah. The connection is discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/145259/36610\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/144616/36610\">here</a>. Because of midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.41.7?vhe=Pirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 41:7</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Chanina said: || In the third month the day is double the night, and the Israelites slept until two hours of the day, for sleep on the day of the (feast of) 'Azereth is pleasant, the night being short. And Moses went forth and came to the camp of the Israelites, and he aroused the Israelites from their sleep, saying to them: Arise ye from your sleep, for behold, your G-d desires to give the Torah to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To correct the words of the midrash, we have a minhag not to sleep on Rosh Hashanah (and later the midrash became a source for another minhag not to sleep on the night of Shavuos <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38945/coffee-and-the-source-for-reason-for-staying-up-for-shavuos\">once coffee became available</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>During the times of the Talmud, the Jewish communities in the Persian empire often faced persecutions from the followers of Zoroastreanism, the old official Persian religion. Many of the established Rosh Hashanah simanim and minhagim externally appear similar to those of Zoroastreans celebrating Nowruz (their New Year) and other holidays. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haft-sin#:%7E:text=Haft%20Seen%20or%20Haft%20sin%20%28Persian%3A%20%D9%87%D9%81%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%29%20is,the%20beginning%20of%20spring%20in%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haft Sin</a> (Persian: هفت‌ سین‎, originally هفت‌ چین: Haft Chin<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/rendezvous-with-godhardcoverstandard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>) is an Iranian tradition of a festive table for the holiday of Nowruz. Haft Sin includes 7 elements, the names of which begin with the letter ﺱ - \"Sin\", the fifteenth letter of the Persian alphabet: سیر (sir) - garlic, a symbol of medicine; سیب (sib) - apples, a symbol of beauty and health; سبزه (sabzeh) - sprouts (wheat or lentils), a symbol of the revival of nature; سنجد (senjed) - lokh, a symbol of love; سرکه (serke) - vinegar, a symbol of wisdom and patience; سمنو (samanu) - bread pudding, a symbol of prosperity; سماق (somag) - sumac, a symbol of dawn.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A \"book of wisdom\" is also commonly included, which might be, <em>Avesta</em>, the <em>Shahnameh</em>, the <em>Quran</em> or the <em>Divān of Hafez</em>. They place on the table sweets, nuts, decorated eggs, a mirror, candles, goldfish, as well as a ribbon or any composition of traditional Iranian flowers (green-white-red), or the flag itself are often present on the table. Coins (سکه sekke), hyacinth (سنبل sonbol), and clock (ساعت suat also pronounced so-at) are sometimes included too.</p>\n<p>It is common practice on the eve of Nowruz to bring \"Haft Sin\" to the graves of relatives so that the deceased can also take part in the holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>Externally, it appears that the Jewish customs were observed on purpose so that the surrounding Persians did not think that the Jews were practicing Judaism.</strong> However, the Jewish customs have Jewish sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The apple in honey. <em>Apple</em> comes from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 2:3</a>, and <em>honey</em> in the ancient world was “food of kings”, for example, Yaakov avinu included <em>honey</em> as a gift to the Egyptian Vice Roy (who turned out to be Yosef). Regarding Apple we have Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 88a</a> written in the contexts of <em>Matan Torah</em>:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “As an apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit and its fruit was sweet to my taste” (Song of Songs 2:3)? Why were the Jewish people likened to an apple tree? It is to tell you that just as this apple tree, its fruit grows before its leaves, so too, the Jewish people accorded precedence to “We will do” over “We will hear.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Maharal miPrague in Chudushei Aggados (Horayos perek 4, 60:1) notes that Jewish simanim allude to the qualities of Jewish heroes that we expect as <em>ushpizin</em>-guests on the holiday of Succos, which comes two weeks after Rosh Hashanah:</li>\n<li>For example, zucchini or pumpkin (קָרָא) - to declare nullified bad decrees and proclaim (קרי) merit, which alludes to Avraham. Avraham chose to follow the path of good commandments, which gave merit and protected him from troubles.</li>\n<li>Fenugreek, beans (רוביא) - to increase merit (רובה) allude to Yitzchak. Yitzchak, through self-control, re-dug up his father's wells that other people buried, and his harvest was <em>increased</em> 100 times.</li>\n<li>Leek (כָרָתֵי) - so that all who hate and envy be cut off (כרת), and friends remain alludes to Yaakov. Yaakov chose the path of truth, thanks to which he defeated angels and his enemies, since the truth swallows any lie.</li>\n<li>One can draw several other such derushim about all traditional simanim connecting them to also Moshe, Aharon, Yosef, and David.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>When people make various wishes, which are not connected to Jewish sources, there is a danger that they look like the described customs of Zoroastreans.

Chama bar Chanina, but not quite his understanding of the opinion of the Rabbonan.</p>\n<p>There is also a midrash Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 29, which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabban Gamaliel said: Abraham sent and called for Shem, the son of Noah, and he circumcised the flesh of the foreskin of our father Abraham, and the flesh of the foreskin of Ishmael his son, as it is said, \"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son\" (Gen. 17:26). \"In the selfsame day\" (means) in the might of the sun at midday. Not only that, but (it indicates) the tenth day of the month, the Day of Atonement. It is written in connection with the Day of Atonement, \"Ye shall do no manner of work on that selfsame day, for it is a day of atonement\" (Lev. 23:28); and in the present instance the text says, \"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised\" (Gen. 17:26). Know then that on the Day of Atonement (<strong>Yom Kippurim</strong>) Abraham our father was circumcised. Every year the Holy One, blessed be He, sees the blood of our father Abraham's circumcision, and He forgives all the sins of Israel, as it is said, \"For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you\" (Lev. 16:30). In that place where Abraham was circumcised and his blood remained, there the altar was built, and therefore, \"And all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar\" (Lev. 4:30). (It says also), \"I said unto thee, In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live\" (Ezek. 16:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We thus have 3 opinions about the date of Avraham Avinu's bris milla:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rabbi Chama bar Chanina according to Nachalas Yaakov says that it was done on the 12th of Nissan</li>\n<li>Rabbonan according to R. Eliyahu Mizrachi say that it was don on erev Pesach the 14th of Nissan (if not towards the evening of the beginning of the 15th of Nissan).</li>\n<li>Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer says it was done on the 10th of Tishrei - Yom haKippurim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have 2 questions:</p>\n<p>A. Both according to Rabbi Eliezer (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.10b.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 10b</a>) and Rabbi Yehoshua (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.11a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 11a</a>) Yitzchak avinu was born on 15th of Nissan, the day (or the next day) when the angel made a mark on a wall (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.2?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 21:2</a>). Can we use the suggestion of Nachalas Yaakov to explain how according to all opinions the Avraham's milla occured on 12th of Nissan, including the Pirkei d'R. Eliezer's?</p>\n<p>B. Alternatively, if these are 3 different opinions based on different calculations what would be the calculations of Pirkei d'R. Eliezer, assuming that he knew the aggados mentioned by R. Mizrachi and Nachalas Yaakov?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To answer the question, let us try to follow the hint of Nachalas Yaakov, that the procedure of <em>bris milla</em> of Avraham avinu took place on the 12th of Nissan. Therefore, the chakhamim are not arguing about timing when the procedure took place, but rather they argue about timing when Avraham avinu's bris milla was counted to him as a mitzvah. The easiest position then is that of R' Chama bar Chanina, who states that the bris milla was counted as a mitzvah at the moment of the procedure.</p>\n<p>To understand the position of the Rabbonan, one has to carefully read the following mashal from Chofetz Chayim on the Torah, Maaseh l'Melekh, parsha Vaeschanan), which I encountered by an accident in the commentary of Chofetz Chayim on Siddur, Mizmor shir l'Yom haShabbos to words of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.92.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 92:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>...though all evildoers blossom, it is only that they may be destroyed ...</strong> The matter is similar to a sick person suffering from illness, who got wearied from various doctors and their therapies, untill s/he encountered a great specialist who knew how to cure the illness. However, once the person signed for the treatment with the specialist, and took the prescribed bitter medicines he started feeling that his condition worsened. The sickness intensified, so that every part of the body suffered pain, from his/her foot to his/her head, the person was hanging like a sinner between life and death.</p>\n<p>However, the wise specialist doctor explained to the sick person the purpose of the therapy so that it became clear to him: \"Oh you know my dear that the desease was latent and hidden within your body. All remedies did not provided cure for you. Because of that, I had to give you strong drugs that would bring your illness out. And from now on I can give you drugs that will completely cure the disease. Such is the case with the wicked, if we see that they began sprouting like grass and all types of evildoers blossom, and makers of wickedness succeed - that's a sign that the sickness revealed itself out and there is hope that we can rely on the words \"it is only that they may be destroyed forever\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from the mashal, that the moment of biggest pain can be viewed as the moment when the <em>desease revealed itself and the cure is coming</em>. As we know from the cases of <em>anshei S'dom</em>, the 3rd day after bris millah is viwed in our tradition as a day when a person experiences the biggest pain. This pain is therefore the <em>kapparah</em> for whatever a person did while being uncircumcized. This explains the position of the Rabonnan, according to Nachalas Yaakov.</p>\n<p>Finally, we can understand the position of Pirkei d'Rabi Eliezer in regards to bris millah. The day of Yom Kippur brings <em>kapparah</em>, all intentional sins become unintentional, and all unintentional sins are erased. Thus, according to this opinion the effect of the mitzvah is delayed till Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather it was to collect in one place every recorded halacha mentioned in any of the authoritative works of the Sages through history. This is why so much effort has been made to find the source of every Halachah: if it is in there, it must be a law stated somewhere in the Rambam's predecessors.

The problem, is that the act of Creation occured long before the time that the Jewish history start. Therefore, it cannot serve as a day of \"<em>rememberance</em>\" that occured in the Jewish history. He explains that it is not a simple day of rememberance that we observe, but specifically the <em>rememberance of terua</em>. (in what follows I will be quoting the book even if I will not use the quotation marks for readability). In the book of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 10:1-10</a>, the Torah tells us that a <em>terua</em> is one of two musical notes produced by the trumpet or the shofar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The terua was blown in two sets of circumstances: as a signal to the Jewish people to move their encampment from one place to another (Bamidbar 10:5-6), and in the event of war, to \"remind G-d\" of their precarious plight, through the tremulous, staccato sound of their blowing (Bamidbar 10:9). An alternative shofar sound , the <em>tekia</em>, was blown to gather (<em>uvehak'hil</em>) the people (Bamidbar 10:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is only one place in the Torah prior to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 23</a>, the chapter of the holidays, where blowing of shofar on Rosh Hashanah is mentioned. The place is in the book of Shemos in the parshas Yisro during the revelation of G-d's presence at Mount Sinai. There the Torah speaks three times of the sounding of shofar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 19:16</a>: On the third day, as morning dawned, there was thunder (<em>koloth</em>), and lightning, and a dense cloud upon the mountain, and <em>a very loud blast (kol) of the horn</em>; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 19:19</a>: The blare (<em>kol</em>) of the horn grew louder and louder. As Moses spoke, G-d answered him in sound (<em>bekol</em>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 20:15</a>: All the people witnessed the thunder (<em>koloth</em>) and lightning, the blare (<em>kol</em>) of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they fell back and stood at a distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the day of Rosh Hashanah is the day of rememberance of our experience of standing at mount Sinai as we were receiving the Torah.</p>\n<p>There is additional biblical support for this thesis from the book of Nehemiah, ch. 8. It describes a dramatic ceremony led by Ezra the Scribe after the Jewish people returned from the Babylonian exile. The ceremony took place on the 1st day of the 7th month. During the ceremony people gathered as one and responded Amen in fear and trembling as Ezra standing on a raised platform (suggesting a mountain) <em>revealed</em>  to the confused and struggling returnees to the Land of Israel the Torah of Moshe that they had forgotten. Apparently, Ezra also saw a linkage between the day of Rosh Hashanah and the awe-inspiring revelation of the Torah to the Jewish people who stood at the foot of Mount Sinai.</p>\n<p>This connection goes deep through many minhagim of Rosh Hashanah, such as sounding 3 different sounds of shofar: sound of shofar (<em>kol</em>), sound of thunder (<em>koloth</em>), sound of G-d's voice. We sound shofar after reading 10 verses hinting to 10 commandments. We sound 3 sets of Shofar blows after Malkiyoth, Zikhronoth, and Shofaroth corresponding to the quoted 3 verses. There is much more that is discussed in the book on this beautiful subject.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I always thought it was to remember that Adam sinned on that day and was forgiven.

However, they typically don't at the end of a fast day.  They might have a 2:00 mincha, but they don't have mincha right before plag and maariv right after.</p>\n<p>Why not?  I'd think it would be convenient for some people (especially those who have both little kids who are not fasting and young teenagers who are) to be home with that much extra time before the end of the fast.  And if you're feeling sick, it might be better to daven at the earliest possible time before you feel worse.</p>\n<p>Are there halachic reasons* not to have these minyanim?  Or sociological reasons?  Or maybe I'm just looking at the wrong shuls and just wrong about the lack of minyanim?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>* reasons relevant specifically to fast days - I'm excluding the reasons not to say birchos krias shema before night, because these are shuls that have a plag mincha/maariv on other weekdays.  I'd be ok in principle with an answer that we're more machmir because it's a day dedicated to teshuva, but I'm skeptical that that's the reason, because there <em>are</em> plag minyanim during the aseres yemei teshuva - just not on Tzom Gedalya.</p>\n\n\n",

This should read, “When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became father of Cainan. And after he became the father of Cainan, Arphaxad lived 430 years and had others sons and daughters. When Cainan had lived 34 years he became the father of Shelah. And after he became the father of Shelah, Cainan lived 330 years and had other sons and daughters.” This reading is based on the Greek text and Luke 3:35-36 (see Gen. 10:24), From a text-critical point of view, it is much simpler to explain an accidental deletion of a name than an addition. This deletion is explained easily by the similarity of the two entries,<sup>12*</sup> a common scribal error. In all likelihood, the Masoretic text then was corrected as necessary to accommodate the omission. This seems more likely than a scribe adding a name to a  fixed genealogy. Some, supporting the Masoretic text, argue that Abraham is the tenth generation, but the parallel is imprecise, for they include the segmented genealogy as part of the linear, unlike the ten linear names in Genesis 5.</p>\n<p>fn 12: LXX reads 130 years, but the additional 100 years is presumably the typical later correction of\nthat recension (see n. 9 above).<br />\nfn. 9: The textual recensions of the SP and of the LXX add one hundred years to the ages of the patriarchs from Arphaxad to Serug at the first son's birth. Perhaps they did so to distance Abraham from Shem and to assure that only Abraham's near ancestors were still alive when he was born. As a whole, the Masoretic text shows itself as more reliable than the other two smoothed recensions, but its omission of Cainan between Arphaad and Shelah is probably secondary. See Waltke, “Samaritan Pentateuch,” 212-39; and G.

According to Jubilees, Cainan, the thirteenth generation from Adam, was sent away after he\ndiscovered the secrets of astronomy and astrology. This knowledge had been imparted by the fallen angels, the Watchers, to human beings before the Flood and these terrestrial ancestors had carved the secrets into rock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is why his name has been blotted out by the certain textual transmission. It also seems that Canaan of Gen 9:18-29 is perhaps the same Cainan from a different <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a> as he has been cursed for his father Ham's sin of not covering up his father Noah, in that version.</p>\n\n\n",

It's long, so look it up: [Gittin 55b-56a and Lamentations Rabbah 4:3]</p>\n<p>You ask: Is this a true story?  Well, it can be corroborated in two ways.</p>\n<p>1-First, the Jewish historian Josephus, who fought in that war, also says that the war began because the Jews did not accept the offering of the Emperor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eleazar, the son of Ananias the high-priest, a very bold youth, who was at that time governor of the temple, persuaded those that officiated in the divine service to receive no gift or sacrifice from any foreigner. And this was the true beginning of our war with the Romans; for they rejected the sacrifice [offered by] Cæsar… When many people … besought them not to reject the sacrifice, which it was customary for them to offer for their [Roman] rulers, they would not be prevailed upon. [Josephus, Wars II, 17:2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2-Second, the Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hence the popular saying: “Because of Kamtza and Bar Kamtza the Temple was destroyed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that it was a \"popular saying\" indicates that the story was believed true and widely known.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are several theories offered besides the Wikipedia article. One such theory, Roman Provenance, is advocated by James S. Valliant and Warren Fahy in their book \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1949914615\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Creating Christ</a>\". They analyzed the Roman coins as a source of Roman imperial propaganda and found that the imperial family of Flavii used early Christian symbols on their coins. The historical records also showed that in every country that Romans conquered they modified the local religions to make it more Roman and less local (they took this policy from the Greeks). One finds that development of Christianity coincided with the rebellion. Thus, on one hand we had reformers of the Jewish religion (zealots, sicarii, and some orthodox saducee circles) who pushed for messianic and apocalyptic prophesies (such as the so-called \"Star\" prophesy). On the other side we find a strong and powerful Roman adversary seeking to completely uproot Judaic tradition using the Herodian family and its circle. We can see support for this idea in the midrash Eleh Ezkera, where the Roman emperor seeks to uproot all the major rabbis whose opinions shaped the Rabbinic Oral Torah. Analysis of the New Testament also shows a strange mixture of certain leaders who appear as leaders of rebellion who at the same time spoke about peace with Romans with whom they fought.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one should not neglect connection to the Parthian/Persian empire which had multiple wars with Romans lasting over 6 centuries, pretty much to the time of the Arab conquest, when neither Romans nor Persians had anyone to hold weapons. After the Roman Conquest, the Chashmonaim and rebel leaders sought the help of Persians. In part, apocalyptic teachings from the 2nd Temple are similar conceptually to those of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zoroastrianism</a>. Persians did not want to have Romans in the Middle East and it was to their advantage to supply the Jewish rebels with weapons. For example, the Persian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabene\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adiabene kingdom</a> was known as a helper of Jewish rebels.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bereishith (Genesis) chapter 49 begins with a reference to \"the end of days.\" Is that understood to refer to something still future?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Bereishith (Genesis) chapter 49 begins with a reference to \"the end of days.\" Is that understood to refer to something still future?:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א  וַיִּקְרָא יַעֲקֹב, אֶל-בָּנָיו; וַיֹּאמֶר, הֵאָסְפוּ וְאַגִּידָה לָכֶם, אֵת אֲשֶׁר-יִקְרָא אֶתְכֶם, בְּאַחֲרִית הַיָּמִים.</p>\n<p>1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: 'Gather yourselves together, <strong>that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the end of days.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0149.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0149.htm</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are several directions to interpret the verse. The basic source is Bereshis Rabba 98:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<strong>Jacob called to his sons, and he said: Gather, and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days. Assemble and hear, sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father</strong>” (Genesis 49:1–2).</p>\n<p>“Jacob called to his sons.” “The lot is cast in the bosom” (Proverbs 16:33) – this is the lottery of Yom Kippur. “And all of one’s judgment is from the Lord” (Proverbs 16:33) – to determine which will be for God and which will go to an uninhabitable land.</p>\n<p>Another matter: “The lot is cast in the bosom” – this is the lot of the tribes. “And all of one’s judgment is from the Lord” – that the Holy One blessed be He agreed with him to give each and every one as befitting him.\n“Jacob called to his sons” – Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Pinḥas: Rabbi Yudan said: Jacob called the Almighty to be with his sons. Rabbi Pinḥas said: He invited Him to his sons. Rabbi Avun said: He appointed Him steward for his sons.\n“He said: Gather ….” – gather from the land of Egypt and assemble in Rameses. Gather from the ten tribes and assemble to the tribe of Judah and Benjamin. He commanded them to act with deference to the tribe of Judah and Benjamin.\nRabbi Aḥa said: Purify yourselves, just as it says: “They gathered themselves together…” (Nehemiah 12:28), “and they purified the chambers” (Nehemiah 13:9). The Rabbis say: He commanded them regarding dissension. He said to them: ‘You shall all be one assembly.’ That is what is written: “You, Son of man, take for you one piece of wood, and write on it: [For Judah] and for the children of Israel [his companions]” (Ezekiel 37:16) – it is written “his companion” – the children of Israel became a single group. Prepare yourselves for redemption. What is written thereafter? “I will render you one nation…” (see Ezekiel 37:22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the one question that OP is asking only shows Yaakov's intention and failure to reveal the end of days as almost all commentaries note afterwards:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[I will tell you] what will befall you at the end of days” – Rabbi Simon said: He showed them the downfall of Gog, just as it says: “It will be at the end of days” (Ezekiel 38:16). Rabbi Yehuda said: He showed them the building of the Temple, just as it says: “It will be at the end of days that the mountain of the House of the Lord will be established” (Micah 4:1). The Rabbis said: He came to reveal the End, but it was concealed from him.\nRabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Elazar bar Avina: Two people, the End was revealed to them and was then concealed from them. They are Jacob and Daniel. Daniel – “But you, Daniel, obscure the matters and seal” (Daniel 12:4). Jacob – “what will befall you at the end of days.”\n“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength, and the first of my potency; greater honor and greater power” (Genesis 49:3).\n“Reuben, you are my firstborn” – this teaches that he came to reveal the End, but it was concealed from him. This is analogous to a king’s confidant who was passing from the world, and his sons were surrounding his bed. He said to them: ‘Come and I will reveal to you the secrets of the king.’ He lifted his eyes and gazed at the king. He said to them: ‘Be vigilant regarding the honor of the king.’ So, Jacob our patriarch lifted his eyes and saw the Divine Presence standing over him. He said to them: ‘Be vigilant regarding the honor of the Holy One blessed be He.’ The Rabbis said: So, the congregation of Koraḥ was sinking and descending, sinking and descending, until Hannah stood and prayed on their behalf: “The Lord puts to death and brings to life; He lowers to the netherworld and elevates” (I Samuel 2:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The harshness may be indicative of the urgency to do so.</p>\n<p>Evidently, the words imply that Moshe Rabbeinu foresaw and knew that, unless people change their attitude, there would be future exiles of the Jewish people. There are several places in the Torah and the commentaries where this idea is repeatedly stated.</p>\n<p><strong>Source 1</strong>. When Moshe spoke with Hashem at the burning bush he says <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 4:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But he said, “Please, O my lord, make someone else Your agent.” I.e. make someone else Your agent Lit. “send through whomever You will send.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Targum Yonasan ben Uziel translates <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Exodus.4.13?lang=bi#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this verse</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And he said, I pray for mercy before the Lord. Send now Thy sending by the hand of Phinehas, by whom it is to be sent at the end of the days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, exodus from Egypt was supposed to be only the first one. This is also implied in the Rashi's comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another explanation is: by the hand of some other person whom Thou wilt be pleased to send — for in the end “I” shall not bring them into the land of Palestine nor shall “I” become their deliverer in the future — and <strong>You have many messengers</strong>! (Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 40)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Source 2</strong> When Jewish people sinned with making the Golden Calf some of the commentaries explain the image of the calf from Maase Merkava in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.1.10?lang=bi#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 1:10</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each of them had a human face [at the front]; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right; each of the four had the face of an <strong>ox on the left</strong>; and each of the four had the face of an eagle [at the back].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The human form is known to us from the image of keruvim i.e. the mishkan, where the image of human-form keruvim was present inside Kodesh haKodashim. The right side usually symbolizes <em>geula</em>, revelation of Shechina, as Hashem took Jewish people with his right hand out of Egypt. Instead the Jewish people chose the image of the ox from the left which symbolizes <em>galus</em> and distancing of Shechina.</p>\n<p><strong>Source 3</strong> In the episode of the bitter waters when Moshe rabbeinu hit the rock, some of the commentaries explain that Moshe did not want to raise the new generation to the level of their parents. For just like their parents faced the test with the Golden Calf and failed it, Moshe rabbeinu thought that the new generation would not be able to successfully emerge from a similar test. In other words, Moshe rabbeinu and the Jewish people accepted the idea of future exiles as an alternative to attempting immediately correct the sin of the Golden Calf (long short road).</p>\n<p><strong>Source 4</strong> The Torah section that we read on Tisha b'Av <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.25-40?lang=bi&aliyot=0#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:25-40</a> speaks about future exiles not as a conditional, but factually.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you have begotten children and children’s children and are long established in the land, should you act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness, causing your God Hashem displeasure and vexation. I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you that you shall soon perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess; you shall not long endure in it, but shall be utterly wiped out. Hashem will scatter you among the peoples, and only a scant few of you shall be left among the nations to which Hashem will drive you. There you will serve gods of wood and stone, made by human hands, that cannot see or hear or eat or smell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, one should understand the words of Moshe rabbeinu not as a harsh rebuke, but the fact of the objective vision of the future. Given that vision, he is teaching Jewish people about how we can survive and carry the message of Hashem who took us out of Mitzraim.</p>\n\n\n",

Typically, problems like this one happen at the workplace, but we go to work to do work. The best way to address situation is to try to find out how the report can be produced in the shortest time possible and you certainly need to speak to the manager together with your co-worker about that. Alternatively, if the report is no longer needed you may discuss how to avoid forgetting the assigned tasks by using electronic calendar reminders, sticky notes, and other available tools - by being factual on the task, rather than by trying to give <em>mussar</em> to your teammates.</p>\n<p>If you want to sharpen your skills about halachic problems to avoid, you may review any of the sources available such as \"<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578197590.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Laws of Interpersonal Relationships</a>\" by R.

What is meant by a \"portion\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It states in many sources, including the Alshich's commentary on Shir Hashirim (1:1 iirc), Chesed LeAvraham, Maayan 2, Nahar 12, 18, etc. that every Jew's soul derives from one of the 600,000 letters of Torah. This is interpreted to mean that there are 600,000 perspectives on <em>the entire Torah</em>, each viewing it in their own way. It's also brought (ibid 13) that each Jew has his own Chiddushim to bring into the world, based on his particular perspective. In fact, nobody else can bring YOUR chiddushim, and nobody even knows about it until YOU bring it into the world, even prophets, sages and tzaddikim. The one exception is Moshe, who has all 600,000 perspectives and chiddushim. This is based on Shaar Hagilgulim 17.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps, it is the same idea as Rabbi Kaii's, although from a different angle. One can also explain the words וְתֵן חֶלְקֵנוּ בְתוֹרָתֶךָ using <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hadran.4?vhe=Wikipedia_Hadran&lang=he&with=About&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Hadran <em>tefilah</em> that we recite at the end of finishing a seder of mishnayos or a masekhes of gemara</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מוֹדִים אֲנַחְנוּ לְּפָנֶיךָ יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ וֶאֱלֹהֵי אַבוֹתֵינוּ <strong>שֶׁשַּׂמְתָּ חֶלְקֵנוּ מִיּוֹשְׁבֵי בֵּית הַמִּדְרָשׁ, וְלֹא שַׂמְתָּ חֶלְקֵנוּ מִיּוֹשְׁבֵי קְרָנוֹת</strong>. שֶׁאָנוּ מַשְׁכִּימִים וְהֵם מַשְׁכִּימִים. אָנוּ מַשְׁכִּימִים לְדִבְרֵי תּוֹרָה וְהֵם מַשְׁכִּימִים לִדְבָרִים בְּטֵלִים. אָנוּ עֲמֵלִים וְהֵם עֲמֵלִים. אָנו עֲמֵלִים וּמְקַבְּלִים שָׂכָר וְהֵם עֲמֵלִים וְאֵינָם מְקַבְּלִים שָׂכָר. אָנוּ רָצִים וְהֵם רָצִים. אָנוּ רָצִים לְחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, וְהֵם רָצִים לִבְאֵר שַׁחַת. שֶׁנֱאמַר: וְאַתָּה אֱלֹהִים תּוֹרִדֵם לִבְאֵר שַׁחַת אַנְשֵׁי דָמִים וּמִרְמָה לֹא יֶחֱצוּ יְמֵיהֶם וַאֲנִי אֶבְטַח בָּךְ:</p>\n<p>We give thanks before You, Lord, our G-d and G-d of our fathers, for <strong>you gave us a share among those who sit in the study hall, and not among those who sit on street corners</strong>. For we arise early, and they arise early; we arise for words of Torah, and they arise for words of emptiness. We work, and they work; we work and receive a reward, and they work and do not receive a reward. We run, and they run; we run towards eternal life, and they run to a pit of desolation. As it says: (Psalms 55:24) \"And You, O Lord, bring them down into a pit of desolation, people of blood and deceit will not live out half of their days; and I, I will trust in You.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the prayer explains, the Jewish person oftentimes does all the same activities as anybody else. However, the intent of every action is to identify and perform a rooted in it mitzvah, building a relationship with HKBH. Thus, getting a portion in the Torah, is also a request to connect and reframe one's acquired daily wisdom in the language of our wonderful heritage of the Torah of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 40b</a>) rejects the suggestion to let children drink the wine for an adult since the children may get used to drinking wine on Yom Kippur and think that is allowed.

As Amram was <em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.1.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gadol haDor</a></em> the miracle with his 126 year old wife (R. Chaim Kanievsky corrects 124 year old) served to show that even in such circumstances people should continue having children.</p>\n<p>Family is built on mutual trust. All Avos married within a family, for example, because it is easier to have trust to one's own kin as Avraham instructed Eliezer. Eisav was the first one who married outside the family. However, his most expensive item he kept in his parents' house. It was the coat that he took from Nimrod, which Yaakov borrowed to get a blessing from Yitzchak. Eisav did so in relatively good times because he could not trust his wives. Many Rabbis in gemara married their nieces for this reason. Difficult times put big strain on relationships that are not strong. Amram was gadol hador, and did not want to endanger shalom bayis due to extenuating circumstances of crushing Egyptian hostility.</p>\n\n\n",

The Bible records a different Zechariah (the son of Jehoiada) being killed in the temple, but nothing about the death of Zechariah the son of Berechiah. My question is, according to Jewish tradition, how did Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the author of the book, die? Is this New Testament text referencing a known contemporary tradition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya.</p>\n<p>I actually wrote an essay for a course at uni on this topic about a year ago.</p>\n<p>The NT is referencing a Jewish tradition that appears in several other sources in variant forms. The oldest inherently Jewish version was preserved in <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Prophets\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vitae Prophetarum</a></em>, a Greek apocryphal work describing the lives of various Tanachic prophets (including extra-biblical tidbits) that many scholars believe was translated from a now-lost Hebrew <em>vorlage</em> authored by Jews, perhaps circa the 1st century CE. David Satran, <em>Biblical Prophets in Byzantine Palestine: Reassessing the Lives of the Prophets</em>, Leiden 1995, is of the opinion that the work is of Christian Byzantine origins, but concedes that the stories of Zechariah b. Jehoiada and Isaiah are likely much older Jewish traditions.</p>\n<p>In the chapter on the life of Zechariah b. Jehoiada it says (C. C. Torrey, <em>The Lives of the Prophets: Greek Text and Translation</em>, Philadelphia, PA 1946, p. 47):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>He was of Jerusalem, the son of Jehoiada the priest, the prophet whom Joash king of Judah slew beside the alter, whose blood the house of David shed within the sanctuary, in the court. The priests buried him beside his father.</strong></p>\n<p>From that time on there were portentous appearances in the temple, and the priests could see no vision of angels of God, nor give forth oracles from the inner sanctuary; nor were they able to inquire with the ephod, nor to give answer to the people by Urim and Thummim, as in former time.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the story is about Zechariah b. Jehoiada, not Zechariah b. Berechiah. From your OP, I gather that you're probably aware of various explanations for why the NT references Ben Berechiah, so I won't get into that. Suffice it to say that the Jewish versions have always, to my knowledge, recounted this theme of the blood of the prophet Zechariah as referring to Ben Jehoiada.</p>\n<p>Several more traditional Jewish sources include a variant of this tradition in the form of an aggada describing what happened when the Babylonian general Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem. The chronologically oldest source that contains this version is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.4.5.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Ta'anit 4:6</a> (often 4:5 in printed editions) (my translation from MS Leiden):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabbi Yohanan said: \"80000 priestly youths were killed over the blood of Zechariah.\"<br />\nRabbi Yudan asked Rabbi Aha: \"Where did they kill Zechariah? In the Women's Court or in the Court of Israel? He replied: \"Not in the Court of Israel nor in  the Women's Court but in the Priestly Court, and they did not take care of his blood as one would with the blood of a ram or a stag. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.17.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">There</a> it says \"that person shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.\" However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.24.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> the case was that \"I set her blood on the bare rock\". And why? \"so that it may stir [My] fury and to take vengeance, that is why I set her blood on the bare rock without cover.\"</p>\n<p>Seven transgressions were committed by Israel that day. They killed a priest, and a prophet, and a judge, and spilled clean blood. And defiled the Court. And it was a Sabbath and Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>And when Nebuzardan came here he saw the blood bubbling. He said to them: \"What is the nature of this?\" They replied: \"It is the blood of oxen and sheep and rams that we had sacrificed on the altar.\" They brought oxen and rams and sheep and he slaughtered them upon it and still the blood bubbled. And since they did not admit [the truth] to him, he hung them on the gallows. They said: \"This is because the Holy One, Blessed is He demands his blood from us.\" They said to him: \"That is the blood of a priest and prophet and judge who prophesied against us all that you are doing to us and we rose upon him and killed him.\" And so he brought 80000 priestly youths and slaughtered them, and still the blood bubbled. In that hour, he [Nebuzardan] scolded it and said to it: \"What do you wish, to fell your entire nation over you?\" With this, the Holy One, Blessed is He was filled with mercy and said: \"What with that he is flesh and blood and cruel but has mercy for My children. I, upon whom it is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.4.31?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a> \"for your God is a compassionate God, who will not fail you nor let you perish and will not forget the covenant of your forefathers\" must be all the more so.\" He motioned to [the blood] and it was swallowed in its place.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are several chronologically later versions of this aggadic tradition in other sources: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesikta_DeRav_Kahana.15.7?vhe=Pesikta_de_Rav_Kahana_according_to_an_Oxford_manuscript,_Dov_Mandelbaum_ed.,_N.Y._1987&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peskita de'Rav Kahana 15:7</a> (Mandelbaum edition, pp. 257-259), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eikhah_Rabbah.4.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah 4:13</a> (4:16 in some versions; and several shorter references in other places in Eicha Rabbah), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kohelet_Rabbah.10.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabbah 10:4</a>, and more. Each version subtly edited the tradition, altering sometimes extensively the moral of the story. In the Jerusalem Talmud, the story is presented as part of a compilation of stories and traditions related to the destruction of the two Temples and the tragic end of the Bar Kokhba Revolt. The gist of the story here is that the Jews sinned and brought the punishment upon themselves, but in the end God will have mercy. In several later versions, the blame gradually shifts from the Jews to Zechariah himself (Kohelet Rabbah states explicitly that Zechariah brought his death upon himself and is also to blame for the deaths of the people killed by Nebuzardan!).</p>\n<p>In my essay, I argued that the NT also subtly altered the tradition, and this is most evident in the Matthian version. This version, as opposed to the Lukian version, uses the Greek phrase <em>αἷμα δίκαιον</em>, which means \"righteous blood\". Some English translators translate it to mean \"innocent blood\", but the Greek phrase is nearly consistently used in the LXX as a translation of the Hebrew \"דַּם צַדִּיקִים\" (blood of the righteous).<sup>1</sup> I believe that it was the author's intent to reference the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Lamentations.4.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lamentations 4:13</a> \"It was for the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests, who had shed in her midst the blood of the righteous\", whose LXX translation likewise uses the phrase <em>αἷμα δίκαιον</em> for \"blood of the righteous\". The idea presented in the verse in Lamentations is that the Judahites are to be blamed for all of the bad things that befell them, because they had killed their prophets and priests. The NT draws a connection between the sins described in Lamentations and the sins of its story's present (the death of Jesus, supposedly the fault of the Jews) and uses the tradition of the blood of Zechariah as proof that the Jews (equated with the Judahites) are prophet-killers and deserve to be punished. In this, the NT identified the \"blood of the righteous\" of Lamentations with the blood of the prophets and priests killed by the Jews.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the subtle editing of the Jewish version in later midrashic compilations was a reaction - at least in part - to this Christian polemic. Jewish exegetes used their versions to argue against the Christian version: In the Eicha Rabbah version, the phrase \"blood of the righteous\" clearly refers to the masses slaughtered by Nebuzardan to appease Zechariah's bubbling blood. And the aggadic unit ends with the phrase \"and upon <strong>that</strong> time it is said: \"It was for the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests, who had shed in her midst the blood of the righteous\" (Lam 4:13) - <strong>upon the death of the Judahites at the hand of Nebuzardan, not upon the deaths of the priests and prophets killed earlier by the Judahites</strong>. And, of course, all versions end with God's mercy towards the Judahites, as opposed to the NT's view, which is that Jews are undeserving of mercy.</p>\n<p>Point is, yes, the NT is referencing a contemporary, and perhaps even older Jewish tradition, but it altered it in a way that suited its own exegetical needs. I would say that the \"purest\" (i.e., least polemically altered) versions are those presented in the <em>Vitae Prophetarum</em> and the Jerusalem Talmud.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>As for the death of Zechariah b. Berechiah in Jewish sources, to my knowledge the only mention of his death is in relation to the end of the prophetic period when Alexander conquered the Land of Israel. He seems to have died more or less at the same time as the prophets Haggai and Malachi, and likely in a natural way. For example (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Seder_Olam_Zutta.7.1?vhe=Seder_Olam_Zuta,_Rabbi_M._Grossberg._London,_1910&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Zuta</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And in [the days of Meshulam, son of Zerubbabel] the Greek Empire rose up and ruled, during the 52nd year of the Persian and Median Empire.

The one exception which translates the phrase \"דם נקי\" (clean blood) as <em>αἷμα δίκαιον</em> is <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/pro/6/17/s_634017\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prov 6:17</a>, however it is generally agreed that the LXX of Proverbs as we have it today is vastly different from the septuagints of the other books of the Bible. Moreover, as T. A. W. Van der Louw, <em>Transformations in the Septuagint: Towards an Interaction of Septuagint Studies and Translation Studies</em>, Leuven, Paris and Dudley, MA 2007, pp. 308-309 pointed out, it's quite possible that <em>αἷμα δίκαιον</em> was used in this verse to contrast the \"לשון שקר\" (lying tongue) in the same verse, which is translated by the phonetically similar <em>γλῶσσα ἄδικος</em>.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> There is, however, a slight possibility that the version of the midrash preserved in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesikta_DeRav_Kahana.15.7?vhe=Pesikta_de_Rav_Kahana_according_to_an_Oxford_manuscript,_Dov_Mandelbaum_ed.,_N.Y._1987&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta de'Rav Kahana 15:7</a> echoes a tradition similar to the one brought in the NT, through which the story of the blood of the prophet Zechariah could be related to Zechariah b. Berechiah/b. Jeberechiah. In this version of the story, the midrash is presented as an exposition on the words \"[Jerusalem] was filled with righteousness, but now murderers\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.1.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 1:21</a>). After a note by Rabbi Yudah b. Rabbi Simon on the immoral downfall of Jerusalem, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But now murderers [fill Jerusalem]\" - they commit murders. <strong>There they killed Zechariah and Uriah</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from there the midrash continues along more or less the same lines as the version in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, the mention of Uriah is significant. The prophet Uriah who was killed by the Judahites was Uriah b. Shemaiah from Kiryath-jearim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.26.20-23?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>). But mentioning Zechariah with Uriah seems to have been intended to evoke memories of Zechariah b. Jeberechiah and Uriah the Priest, Isaiah's two witnesses who testify to the downfall of Judah's enemies (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.8.1-4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 8:1-4</a>), and in the aggadah, the coming redemption (see e.g. Makkot 24b linked below). This version of the midrash appears to implicitly state that the Jews were so far gone in evilness, that they even murdered the two individuals who were supposed to herald the coming of the days of peace! In traditional Jewish sources, Zechariah b. Jeberechiah is identified with Zechariah b. Berechiah (see for example: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Makkot.24b.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Makkot 24b</a>). As for Uriah the Priest, there are various suggestions, but the Pesikta's own suggestion is that he is indeed to be identified with Uriah b. Shemaiah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesikta_DeRav_Kahana.13.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13:12</a>).</p>\n<p>Of course, there is no evidence that this is anything other than the editor of the Pesikta's own development of a popular aggadic unit, but it is possible that he based it on some now-lost oral or written tradition that was similar to the one that found its way to the NT.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Shalom,</p>\n<p>We know from 2 Chronicles 24:22 that Zechariah ben Jehoiada was killed, obviously, and the numerous expansions on the significance of this in Jewish tradition (as cited in the answers here).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Josephus mentions the death of Zechariah ben Baruch (~60AD) in the Temple (Wars of the Jews, Book 6.5.4). Obviously, Yeshua of Nazareth would not be referring to him as it is too late, but the cyclical parallel is important, as Jewish history is Jewish prophecy, i.e. maaseh avot siman l'banim (the actions of the fathers serve as a portent for the children), which I believe is provides the key to unlocking the narrative of Matthew 23. This is Yeshua's attempt to avert the Churban HaBayit, and to hasten the Geulah, by bringing a rebuke, the words of which can be found in Talmudic literature, i.e. Sotah 22b, Yoma 72b. Unfortunately, when people read Matthew 23 out of context, they derive conclusions opposite of the intent of the text (i.e. antisemitic diatribes). As we know, the one who rebukes is the one who loves, i.e. \"Let Bilaam who hates Israel bless them, and let Moshe who loves Israel rebuke them.\" (Yalqut Shimoni). This leads us to Zechariah ben Berekiah (ben Iddo).</p>\n<p>Do we have any Jewish tradition of the death of Zechariah ben Berachiah (ben Iddo) that would align with the words in Matthew 23? The answer is yes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חֲזֵי יְיָ וּתְהֵי מִסְתַּכֵּל מִן שְׁמַיָּא לְמַן אִיסְתַּקִיפְתָּא\nכִּדְנַן אִם חֲזֵי לִבְנָתָא דְיִשְׂרָאֵל לְמֵיכַל פֵּירֵי בִטְנֵיהוֹן\nעוּלְמַיָּא רְגִיגְתָא דַהֲווּ מְלַפְפִין בִּסְדִינִין דְמֵלָתֵיהּ\nעֲנַת מִדַּת דִינָא וְכֵן אֲמָרַת אִם חֲזֵי לְמִקְטַל בְּבֵית\nמוּקְדְּשָׁא דַייָ כַּהֲנָא וּנְבִיָּא כְּמָה דִקְטַלְתּוּן יָת\nזְכַרְיָה בַּר עִידּוֹ כַּהֲנָא רַבָּא וּנְבִיָּא מְהֵימָן בְּבֵית\nמוּקְדְשָׁא דַייָ בְּיוֹמָא דְכִפּוּרַיָּא עַל דְאוֹכַח יַתְכוֹן דְלָא\nתַעַבְדוּן דְבִישׁ קֳדַם יְיָ:</p>\n<p>“See, O L-rd, and observe from heaven against whom you have turned.\nThus is it right for the daughters of Israel to eat the fruit of their\nwombs due to starvation, the lovely boys wrapped in fine linen? The\nAttribute of Justice replied, and said, “Is it right to kill priest\nand prophet in the Temple of the L-RD, as when you killed Zechariah\nson of Iddo, the High Priest and faithful prophet in the Temple of the\nL-rd on the Day of Atonement because he admonished you not to do evil\nbefore the L-rd?” <strong>(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aramaic_Targum_to_Lamentations.2.20?lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Lamentations 2:20</a>, translated by C.M.M.\nBrady, Sefaria.org)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Considering that Zechariah ben Berekhiah (ben Iddo) - see Zechariah 1:2, Ezra 5:1, 6:14 -   prophesied the destruction of the Temple (Zechariah 11:1, see Yoma 39b for commentary), and after his death nevuah (prophecy) departed, the same situation (right down to the victim's first name) recycles, to provide the generation the merit to truly repent, thus the three Zechariahs, along with the nevi'im and the tzaddikim, dating all the way back to Hevel form a cyclical chain that recurs over and over again until we pass the test.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems this controversy could have been completely avoided if the <em>Sch'wa nach</em> would not be marked at all, i.e. א. I assume the masoretes invented this <em>nekuda</em> at the same time as the other vowel signs. What was the reason to use the <em>Sch'wa nekuda</em> in both cases as opposed to only the case of <em>Sch'wa na</em>, which somewhat resembles the vowel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Geoffrey Khan has the following proposal (<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/37461691/Geoffrey_Khan_Vowel_Length_and_Syllable_Structure_in_the_Tiberian_Tradition_of_Biblical_Hebrew_Journal_of_Semitic_Studies_32_1_1987_23_82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Vowel Length and Syllable Structure in the Tiberian Tradition of Biblical Hebrew</em></a>, p. 57), which requires some understanding of the Tiberian reading tradition to appreciate.</p>\n<p>In the Tiberian reading tradition, long vowels appeared in more closed syllables than in modern reading traditions, and was in fact the general rule. There is evidence (some presented in the above article) that in such syllables, an epenthetic vowel would be added before the closing consonant. For example, שָׁמְרוּ would be pronounced /šɔ̄-ɔm-rū/, where the super-long syllable /šɔ̄m/ would be opened up by an epenthetic /ɔ/ (the sound of <em>kamatz</em>). Elsewhere (<a href=\"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0163\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p. 289), Khan writes that the \"furtive <em>pataḥ</em>\" (the /a/ in רוּחַ /rū-aḥ/) is this same epenthetic vowel, just with a different vowel quality due to the following gutteral.</p>\n<p>Now we can understand when Khan writes (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the early masoretic and grammatical sources there are allusions to the fact that the <em>šəwa</em> was sometimes mobile. In fact there may have been a degree of variation among individual readers as to whether a <em>šəwa</em> in a given word was made mobile or quiescent. The alternation between mobile or quiescent <em>šəwa</em> did not change the word form in any significant way. In each case the preceding vowel was long and was appropriate for secondary stress: שָׁמְרוּ = <em>šɔ̄-mə-rū</em> ~ <em>šɔ̄-ɔm-rū</em>. ru. It may be said that in these structures there existed a non-distinctive phonotactic variation: consonant + epenthetic ~ epenthetic + consonant. <strong>It was doubtless on account of this non-distinctive alternation\nthat both quiescent and mobile <em>šəwa</em> were represented by the same sign.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He should realize\nthat he does not deserve it.  He should consider the greatness of G-d\nand His exalted splendor and think: what am I?

If I have something intelligent to say, Who gave me intelligence?  If I have built valuable and useful institutions, Who gave me the money and the organizational skills and the contacts to do this?  And therefore I cannot take the credit, but must refer the credit back to the true Benefactor.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, to say \"I am worse than nothing, I am a net drag on the world\" is, in the case of any person that learns Hashem's Torah and keeps His mitzvos, a lie.

I will have to ask the source. The words we say during Shemoneh Esrei \"<em>Before I was formed, I wasn't worthy. Now that I have been formed, it's as if I haven't been formed. I am dust in life, all the moreso in death,</em>\" are dealing with a specific mission that Hashem assigns to each and everyone of us. Before we are born we do not know if we will fulfill this mission and now that we are living, we may not know if we are any close to fulfilling this mission. Therefore, Moshe and Aharon's words can be seen quite inline with this specific statement: \"What are we?\" - i.e. if our actions in this world were bad, we are worse off than at the time we were born; or if we did the mitzvos - did they bring one close to the accomplishment of the mission we had to do?</p>\n<p>In the Gemara there is an important additional meaning in the words of Avraham as explained by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.27?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv's Haemek Davar Bereshis 18:27</a>.

Barukh Epstein connects the words of Netziv to those of Moshe and Aharon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומושה ואהרון, בבטולם את ערך עצמם, אמרו \"ונחנו מה\" (שמות ט\"ז ח).\nואפשר לכוין שתי המליצות (אפר ועפר - ונחנו מה) כי נאמרו למשל, לפי מצב וערך אומריהן, כי לעפר ואפר יש תוצאות הפכיות. כי העפר ניכר שבחה לאחר שעבדוה ותוציא צמחה. וכנגדה - האפר, הי' ששבחו קודם שנעשה לאבק דק, אז כשהי' עץ או מין אחר שמוציאין ממנו אש. כמו שחשיב במשנה ביצה ל\"ג א', אבל מי שנעשה אפר אינו כלום. ועל זה המשיל אברהם את עצמו ביחס גדולי דורות לשניהם, כי כעפר אין לו זכות מיקודם לו, דהיינו זכות אבות, וכאפר - שאין לו זכות אחריו, זכות בנים שברא מזכי אבא (סנהדרין ק\"ד א'). וזה נאמר קודם שנולד יצחק - אבל מושה ואהרון  היו לכם זכותי שני הצדדים לפניהם ולאחריהם, זכות אבות וזכות בנים. ולו היו יכולים להמשיל עליהם הפחיתות מן עפר ואפר, כפי הציור הנזכר, והמשילובטולם בהם עצמם, ואמרו - ונחנו (עצמנו) מה.</p>\n<p>And Moshe and Aharon, in their tremendous humility, said, \"And what are we?\" (Exodus 16:8). And it is possible to align the two statements (ash and dust - and what are we?) which were said as an example, according to the situation and value of their words, that <em>dust/soil</em> and <em>ash</em> have opposite meanings. Because the dust/soil shows richness after one had worked on it and brought forth vegetation. And opposite of it - the ashes, that is when it was a tree / wood or anything else that was used for fire, as discussed in Mishnah Beitzah 4:6-7 (or 33a in the gemara), but once it is turned into ashes it is nothing. And this is why Avraham compared himself to the greats of both groups of generations, because as <em>dust/soil</em> he did not have merits (of great people) that had preceded him, i.e. the merits of fathers; and as <em>ash</em> - he did not have merits afterwards, the merit of sons, as <em>the son confers merit upon the father</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.104a.7?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 104a</a>). These words were said before Isaac was born. However, Moshe and Aaron had merits on both sides before them and after them, the merits of fathers and the merits of children, and they could not express their humility as dust/soil and ashes, like the described comparison. That is why they just said - and \"what are we (ourselves)\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, gemara states that the words of Moshe and Aharon are preferable from this point of view since we, the Jewish people today, always have merits of the previous generations and may we have more children BE\"H.</p>\n\n\n",

The most fitting dialect of Aramaic used in Yekum Purkan is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Babylonian_Aramaic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Babylonian Aramaic</a> of Talmud and Targum Onkelos. The future tense 3rd person male singular of the binyan קַל in Aramaic has form יִכְתּׂב or יִכתּוֹב according to grammars (1) & (2). Therefore, if one intends to say that the offspring will not interrupt (by themselves) and will not cease (by themselves), then one has to use the forms יִפְסוֹק and יִבְטוֹל. This is the case of the siddur Kol Bo, Rabbi Yaakov miEmden, Siddur שפה ברורה, Siddur בית תפילה, Siddur Shabtai Soffer, Siddur haGR\"A, Rinat Yitzchak, and interlinear Artscroll which have יִפְסוֹק and יִבְטוֹל.

In Biblical Aramaic the future tense 3rd person male singular is יִכְתֻּב and יִכְתּוּב.</p>\n<p>There was also well-documented trend among Ashkenazim over the centuries to \"correct\" editions of siddur and Targumim to Biblical Hebrew, and it is likely the same were true about \"correcting\" towards Biblical Aramaic (it certainly happened with kaddish) (Thanks magicker72!). As a result, we find confusion in the older Ashkenazi grammars between the later form of Eastern Aramaic and the earlier form of western Biblical Aramaic.  Old European editions of Mikraos Gedolos and sidurim may have been based on such a mixed view.</p>\n<p>The Siddur haGR\"A illustrates the difference between grammars (1) & (2) vs. grammars that mixed Aramaic dialects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>יִפְסוֹק ... יִבְטוֹל</strong> (שניהם בחולם) כ\"ה בס\"י, בסידור רנ\"ה שניהם במלאפום</p>\n<p>(Both with holam) so it is in <strong>Old Siddurim</strong>. Siddur R. Naftali Hertz haLevi - both words with melaphum (i.e. <em>shuruk</em> יִפְסוּק ... יִבְטוּל).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yemenite siddurim and editions of targumim have have <em>shuruk</em> rather than <em>holam</em>. As mentioned by OP, there are still a number of Ashkenazi siddurim, which also have <em>shuruk</em>, such as Siddur תפילת יוסף with piskei Mishna Berura, many Artscroll Siddurim, Koren, Birnbaum, Shilo, and many older ones.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is also a possibility for a reading in the passive. For example, siddur <em>Tefilas Yosef</em> explains its girsa:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זַרְעָא דִּי לָא יִפְסוּק - זרע אשר לא יפסיק ולא יתבטל מדברי תורה</p>\n<p>The offspring which will not cease and <strong>will not be canceled</strong> from the words of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The comment implies the reading in passive: <em>offspring will not be destroyed</em> by others. However, the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic passive should be using the binyan אִתַּפְעַל as explained in grammars (1) and (2), which in the future tense 3rd person male singular has form יִתַּפְסַק and יִתַּבְטַל. Such a form will create reading <em>offspring will not get interrupted or ceased or nullified</em> <em><strong>by others</strong></em>. Probably, the misunderstanding of Shabtai Soffer regarding the girsa of RY\"N in siddur Maharshal comes from the <em>corruption</em> of the יִתַּפְסַק to יְפַסַק.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sources on Aramaic Grammar for the forms of Aramaic verb binyanim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) <em><a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/grammar-for-gemara-targum-onkelos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Grammar for Gemara and Targum Onkelos</a></em> by R.

If no flame is available over which to recite a blessing, it does not prevent one from reciting havdala. The Rashba in the name of the Ra'avad (there), and Ritva Hilchot Brachot 8:17, says the same applies to besamim. We also pasken like this in Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 297:1. This is a case in which the person himself is doing the havdala doesn't have besamim in which halachially speaking one is not obligated to say besamim when it is available to him. I think we can say that all the more so when the person just listening to havdala where there was besamim but he didn't have the chance to smell, for sure is not obligated to go back home and smell besamim.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, even if one is not obligated one is highly suggested to go back home and smell besamim as the Meiri Brachot 53a says that it is to honor Shabbat to make it known that we have a neshama yeteira which is leaving us and we are sad about it.</p>\n\n\n",

And he shall place the incense upon the fire, before the L-rd, so that the cloud of the incense shall envelope the ark cover that is over the [tablets of] Testimony, so that he shall not die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud explains that the High Priest must pour the incense from a special spoon into his hands and from the hands onto the coals etc. The physical juggling of the spoon tilting into his two hands and then onto the coals in a way that he doesn't lose a grain of incense in the process is called \"Chafinah\" and is one of the most difficult of services to perform properly in the temple. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.47b?lang=bi#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 47b</a> at the top of the page)(\"Some say he holds the bowl/spoon with his fingertips, some say with is teeth etc.\" See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.49b?lang=bi#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 49b</a>, also at the top of the page.)</p>\n<p>So this was a difficult task and needed practice. The OP asks why the High Priest apparently waited until the last day before Yom Kippur to practice it?</p>\n<p>List of Facts When taken together that help answer the question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Although the Mishnah deals with all time periods; but it is set in the time during the second Temple era, when the office of High Priest was usually filled by people who bid the highest amount to the King or Romans. Many were not neccesarily worthy of the position (even not-so-religious or of the Saducees etc.), but simply bought there way in so they could experience the honor and greatness of being the High Priest on Yom Kippur.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Torah requires that the commandment of the High Priest pouring his \"two handfuls\" of incense be exactly two handfuls and be exactly two handfuls of that particular High Priest's hands doing the service. Therefore the amount of incense used is unknown until we can examine the hands of the High Priest himself. This is an integral part of the difficult \"Chafinah Service\" (pouring the incense on the coals in the Holy of Holies) which the OP is focusing on.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Another important fact is that the Temple would therefore manufacture a special container with a handle that held exactly the amount of incense to be used by that High Priest based on his hands' capacity. Therefore a custom utensil was made for the specific High Priest each year (certainly for different High Priests).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Law is that the Yom Kippur incense was different in physical quality and density, only on the day before Yom Kippur. This is because on the day before Yom Kippur, the incense prepared the whole year was returned to the grinder and re-pounded until it was the \"finest of the finest\" in texture.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The High Priest was only sequestered to live at the Temple 7 days before the day of Yom Kippur.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Gemara says that that in the first Temple (stood for 410 years), only 18 high Priests served but during the second Temple over 300 High Priests served (stood for 420 years). This is because the average high Priest did not last the year because he bought his office and was not worthy. Some were wicked or Sadducees. Others were completely unlearned and did not know Hebrew since they could only understand Scripture in Aramaic like the Book of Daniel. (See Yoma 9a; Yoma 18a - 19b sporadically at length)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2-3. The commandment of \"Chafinah\" required the High Priests exact 2 handfulls and the custom spoon/ladle. see Yoma (47a; Mishnah 1 etc.)</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p>The incense was repounded again erev Yom Kippur. (See Kerisos 6a-b; Jerusalem Talmud Yoma 4:5)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The High Priest lived at the Temple sequestered for the 7 days before Yom Kippur. (See Yoma 1:1)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once we know this we can answer the OP.</p>\n<p>(First the Gemara on 19a seems to quote a Baraisa that implies the High Priest would go learn the \"Chafinah\" service every day of the 7 days. Indeed the Gemara claims that walking too much (each day) to find his way to the incense room to tire him out, was so he would quit from laziness if he was a Sadducee. Therefore it seems like he visited the incense chamber for all 7 days to learn and practice. If not, why did one day of practice tire him out?. However as the OP points out, the Yachin's commentary seems to indicate it was only on the day before Yom Kippur and only after the oath was administered.)</p>\n<p>So wether you hold he practiced 7 days or 1 day, you can still ask why not practice way before for 30 days or a couple of months?</p>\n<p>As we saw, many High Priests bought their office and were not interested in mastering the finer aspects of religious service. Therefore, the Sages and regular Priests didn't get to train the candidate until 7 days before Yom Kippur (when they bought their office).</p>\n<p>Secondly, because the incense had to be the exact amount of that High Priest's two hands volume, the spoon couldn't be manufactured until we met the winning bidder.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, since the incense was re-pounded freshly, only on the day before Yom Kippur, its consistency would change. Therefore, I say the Yachin's explanation is vindicated because the Temple could not manufacture the spoon/ladle for that particular High Priest to practice with, until the day before Yom Kippur, so we would know how much finer and how dense the incense would be, so it could fit exactly into his custom made vessel!</p>\n<p>Again, just my conclusion. I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

That is, it generally begins with a conclusion, poses the question \"How do we know that this conclusion is correct?\", and then seeks proof-texts (either in the written text of the Torah or in a <em>baraita</em> or other Rabbinic source) to justify the conclusion.  Deductive reasoning, in contrast, <em>begins</em> with a premise that is taken to be true and tries to reason <em>towards</em> a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Imagine a hypothetical person who, instead of reasoning abductively, tries to analyze Jewish law deductively.  Such a person might start with one or more proof-texts and reason his way <em>forward</em> towards a conclusion.  It's quite likely that such deductive reasoning might lead to a conclusion that we \"know\" is wrong.  It's not necessarily that the premises of the argument are wrong, or that the logical structure contains errors in reasoning; rather, we know <em>post hoc</em> that the argument <em>must</em> be wrong because we already know what the correct conclusion is.</p>\n<p>(As a not-so-hypothetical example of this, consider a person who begins with the Biblical text \"Whoever kidnaps a man and sells him, or if he is found in his possession, must be put to death\" (<em>Shemot</em> 21:16) and argues his way towards the conclusion that, since Joseph's brothers were never put to death for the sin of selling him into slavery, the Rabbis of the current generation are liable to be put to death. This is, of course, precisely what is narrated in the \"Eileh Ezkerah\" section of the Yom Kippur Musaf.)</p>\n\n\n",

This is not to say that Christianity hasn't made a number of positive contributions to the world of course but wouldn't it be more ideal if G-d were to have propagated another group that was not as antisemitic and hostile and more monotheistic than the Christians?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm almost certain this has been asked and answered here before, but we'll do it once again. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.11.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides, Laws of Kings and Their Wars, 11:7--8.</a> You can read Maimonides' language there.</p>\n<p>But in short, Christianity and Islam have both spread the vocabulary of monotheism throughout the world; even if in ways that Judaism would consider problematic.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a profound question that touches on the larger issue of why G-d allows things that may seem contrary to the ideal world we envision. One perspective, as mentioned by Rambam, is that Christianity and Islam have both contributed to spreading the concept of monotheism across the world, even if the way they do so is not entirely in line with Jewish thought. These religions, while problematic in certain aspects, have played a role in bringing many people closer to understanding some form of G-d, albeit in ways that are different from Judaism.</p>\n<p>It's also important to consider the role of free will. G-d allows people, and even entire groups, the freedom to choose their paths, even if that includes spreading beliefs or committing actions that lead to suffering. This idea can be linked to the broader question of why G-d permits any form of evil or hardship in the world—humans are granted free will, and unfortunately, that often leads to misuse of that freedom.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we can look at the long arc of history. While Christianity may have led to suffering for the Jewish people at various points in history, it has also introduced moral and ethical teachings that, in many ways, align with Torah values. The existence of such a complex relationship between these religions and the Jewish people may point to a larger divine plan, where even actions or movements that seem harmful can eventually lead to greater awareness of G-d and His will in the world.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, while we may struggle with understanding why certain things happen or why G-d allows them, we trust that there is a purpose, even in events that seem painful or confusing from our perspective.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This question is basically the same as the more common \"Why does <strong>G</strong> allow bad things to happen?\"</p>\n<p>This is more complex then saying that one religion proselytizes and the other does not.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally <strong>G</strong> created us with Free will, we are all able to choose to follow <strong>G</strong> or not. This goes both ways, <strong>G</strong> will not interfere with our ability to make choices, if a person rejects <strong>G</strong> then that is their choice.</p>\n<p>I understand that the topic of free will is not as easily reconciled within the Jewish faith. And I've seen arguments for determinism as well as for free will. I believe it is called \"Bechirah chofshit\" which I think was supposed to be based on the 2nd book of Moses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I (<em>G</em>) have set before you life and death, blessing and curse: therefore choose life (2nd Book of Moses \"Deuteronomy\" 30:19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is true on higher levels as well, a group of people will be \"permitted\" to do as they please. To choose life or death.</p>\n<p>As for the suffering they cause, it is permitted because it is a byproduct of sin. <strong>G</strong> does not want us to break his commandments and all preventable suffering is because we have turned away from <strong>HaShem</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On a side note: I think any Christian denomination that is anti-semitic is not Christian at all by their own definitions, Christians should respect jews naturally due to the shared connection to <strong>G</strong>.</p>\n<p>Edit: I'm an Eastern Orthodox Christian, as far as I know Christians are supposed to respect the root, we are to love even those who persecute us, and so on.

Therefore if he was obligated to bring a tentative guilt-offering and Yom Kippur passed while he was in a state of rebellion, Yom Kippur does not generate atonement for him.

That's referring to its dates, yet the Torah says we should take the leaf, and use it for the avodah, rather than the date.</p>\n<p>Why not the date?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I got an answer from <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4Upq0WpZLs6YNz-2l0lZ1vDFAEP7S3f/view?usp=drivesdk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a sicha from the Lubavitcher Rebbe</a>, as well as a few other sources. I wrote it as a dvar Torah, along with other sources and my own structure and delivered it on Sukkot 1 morning. This is the dvar Torah:</p>\n<h3>Sukkot 5785</h3>\n<p>There is a famous midrash, midrash Rabba in Vayikra, that discusses the inner meaning of the arba minim. The etrog has a good fragrance and taste, and represents Jews who have Torah and Mitzvot. The lulav has a good taste, but no smell, and represents Jews who have Torah, but not Mitzvot. The Haddasim have a good fragrance, but no good taste, representing Jews who have Mitzvot but not Torah, and finally, for the rest of us, there is the Aravot, which have neither a good taste or a good fragrance, and represent us Jews deficient in Torah and Mitzvot. Nonetheless, Hashem sees us all as one, and we are all equally precious before Him. This was concealed in Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur – we all had one mitzva that is for all of us – listening to the Shofar. Now on Succot, we have a Mitzva that reveals the differences between us, but nonetheless we are instructed to bind the species together and thus show that we can be all one despite our differences.</p>\n<p>There are two questions I wish to ask. Firstly, it seems clear that the Etrog is the most superior of the minim, as it has Torah and Mitzvot, yet the bracha is “Al Netilat Lulav”, not Etrog!</p>\n<p>Secondly, the point about the lulav is that it has a good taste. That’s referring to its fruit – the dates, rather than the leaf, which is what the Torah tells us to take. Why doesn’t the Torah tell us to take the dates?</p>\n<p>Regarding the first question, the gemara tells us that we take the lulav because it is taller than the rest. What’s that got to do with anything? We have to understand that <strong>even though it says this is a person who has Torah and not Mitzvot, it doesn’t mean that it is discussing a person who has literally no Mitzvot</strong>. Someone who studies but does not perform is described as wicked! <strong>It means that this person dedicates themselves to Torah, in order to perform Mitzvot – they put Torah study as paramount.</strong></p>\n<p>As such, they are able to connect to Hashem more closely. This is because the Torah is described as totally united with Hashem. As it says in Gemara Shabbat, when Hashem gave the Torah, He opened with the word “Anochi”. This interesting choice of word, instead of Ani, was chosen because it is an acronym: “Ana Nafshit Ketovit Yehovit” – I put My soul in writing and gave it to you. The Torah is Hashem revealing Himself to us, and by learning it, we connect to His Wisdom.</p>\n<p><strong>This is why the Ben Yehoyada describes the Lulav as representative of the Tzaddik. He learns Torah as paramount, but all in order to perform its Mitzvot. We are all bound to the Tzaddik, and through the Tzaddik, our Mitzvot and connection to Hashem are established and draw down Hashem’s blessings and love.</strong></p>\n<p>The connection we have to Hashem through Mitzvot is very powerful, but it is not as powerful as through Torah. The Mitzvot are described in the Zohar as the limbs of the King. Just as the limbs of the body are not one with the soul—they are, however, nullified to the soul and fulfill its will automatically as soon as the soul desires—they are nevertheless not the soul itself. So too, the performance of mitzvot reflects a person's submission and nullification to G-d, as he fulfills the Divine will. However, the individual performing the mitzvot still retains their own independent existence and is not, so to speak, unified with the Creator.</p>\n<p>Now we have a basis to understand the concept of waving the Lulav. The Ben Ish Chai explains how the waving corresponds to Hashem’s name, YKVK, indicating that just as this Name represents that Hashem is everywhere, so too we wave the Lulav in all directions to show that we, through our learning, recognise that Hashem‘s dominion is absolute. Not only that, but he says in Ben Yehoyada that by waving the lulav, we are expressing our yearning for Hashem, and this is met with His yearning for us, and thus we create a unity between Him and us, which is possible because of the unity we have amongst ourselves, as indicated by the binding of the four species.</p>\n<p>On top of this, it corresponds to the swaying that we engage in when we learn. The Zohar explains that the reason we sway while we learn is because the soul of man is the candle of Hashem. Just as a candle flickers because it is drawn upwards, so too the soul tries to unite with Hashem through Torah and Mitzvot.</p>\n<p>The soul in heaven is described as standing still, as until we come down into a physical body, we cannot progress or grow. But when we come down, not only can we grow, we have unlimited potential for growth. The essential growth is through Torah, because, as we said, it connects us to Hashem in a perfect unity, even more so than the performance of Mitzvot, and that’s why it is the lulav that has the mitzva of swaying, specifically.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to the question – why do we shake the lulav, which is the leaf of the date palm, and not the date?</p>\n<p>The reason why there is a concept of swaying in Torah learning is because, in order to progress in our studies, we must go through a process of shak[la] vetariya. That is, we ask a question, we give an answer, we ask a question on that answer, and we have to go through this process – of constantly refining, making mistakes, improving, and making more mistakes.</p>\n<p>Let me illustrate this with a story. A father once came to the Alter Rebbe and said, my son is very brilliant, and I thank you for letting him in your yeshiva – he is doing very well. The only issue I have with him is that it is all going to his head, he’s become arrogant. So the Alter Rebbe said, bring him to me. So the father brought him, and the Rebbe asked him a question on a gemara. The Rebbe then said, is it a good question? The bochur said yes. The Rebbe said no it isn’t! And gave a seemingly obvious answer. Then he asked him, is that a good answer? The boy said again yes, and the Rebbe said “no it isn’t!” and proceeded to ask a seemingly obvious kashe on the answer. So, is it a good kashe? The boy said yes, and he said no it isn’t! This went on another half dozen times, until the Rebbe turned to the boy, and said nu, I thought you said he was clever? The boy was taken down a notch, to say the least.</p>\n<p>When it comes to learning, we are meant to approach it with humility and bittul. This is because, even though indeed the Torah does contain all the secrets of life, those secrets are lofty, truly infinite in their beauty and sweetness. All our learning is constantly going towards this beauty, but it is a lifetimes work.</p>\n<p>This is why we don’t shake the date. The real pleasure in learning comes at the end, when we have the answer (\"the ultimate pleasure is the resolution of doubts\"). This is a lifetime’s work, and a reward for the future. For now, Torah study isn’t necessarily as pleasurable as it should be. Indeed Shak’vetariya, and pilpul can be quite frustrating. Nonetheless, this gives us an opportunity to engage in some real bittul. This bittul is what enables all Jews to come together. Even though we are very different, we don’t need to worry, we can still be united, if we can get our egos out of the way, and learn some humility, so indeed the ikar species is the lulav – Torah study, the closeness we get with Hashem, and the humility that enables us to get close to eachother.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question can be further generalized, why the lulav bundle has only branches instead of the fruit of the plants?</p>\n<p>When looking at the question this way, one can recall the verse Devarim 20:19</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּֽי־תָצ֣וּר אֶל־עִיר֩ יָמִ֨ים רַבִּ֜ים לְֽהִלָּחֵ֧ם עָלֶ֣יהָ לְתׇפְשָׂ֗הּ לֹֽא־תַשְׁחִ֤ית אֶת־עֵצָהּ֙ לִנְדֹּ֤חַ עָלָיו֙ גַּרְזֶ֔ן כִּ֚י מִמֶּ֣נּוּ תֹאכֵ֔ל וְאֹת֖וֹ לֹ֣א תִכְרֹ֑ת <strong>כִּ֤י הָֽאָדָם֙ עֵ֣ץ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה</strong> לָבֹ֥א מִפָּנֶ֖יךָ בַּמָּצֽוֹר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bold letters are translated  <em>because a man is a tree of the field</em>. If a man is like a tree, and its fruit are mitzvos, then the branches are man's efforts to fulfill mitzvos. (1)</p>\n<p>Thus, the plants in the lulav bundle can symbolize our efforts in achieving the perfect mitzva (fruit). Perhaps, that is a reason for the mitzvah of shaking in all directions - to seek all possible efforts, as these directions also symbolize 7 physical sefiros (right - chesed, left - gevura, front - tiferes, up - netzach, down - hod, back - yesod, center - malchus, see <em><a href=\"http://iyyun.com/store/new-release-for-sukkot-the-four-species\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Four Species</a></em> by R' DovBer Pinson). Also, one can connect this idea to the well-known midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.30.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabba 30:12</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another matter: “The fruit of a pleasant [hadar] tree” – this is Israel; just as the citron has taste and has fragrance, so Israel has people among them who have Torah and have good deeds. “Branches of date palms” – this is Israel; just as the date palm has taste but has no fragrance, so Israel has people among them who have Torah but do not have good deeds. “A bough of a leafy tree” – this is Israel; just as the myrtle has fragrance but has no taste, so Israel has people among them who have good deeds but do not have Torah. “Willows of the brook” – this is Israel; just as the willow has no taste and has no fragrance, so Israel has people among them who do not have Torah and do not have good deeds. What does the Holy One blessed be He do to them? To eradicate them is not possible. Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: Let them all be bound together in a single bundle and they will atone for one another. If you do so, at that moment, I will be ascendant [mitaleh]. That is what is written: “Who built His upper chamber [maalotav] in the heavens” (Amos 9:6). When is He ascendant? When they are made into a single group, as it is stated: “And established His group upon earth” (Amos 9:6). Therefore, Moses exhorts Israel and says to them: “You shall take for you on the first day.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One can interpret the categories of people, who either have knowledge of Torah, or have good deeds, or neither as applied to own <em>efforts</em> in learning Torah, doing good deeds or just plain physical acts - all tied to perform each and one single mitzva symbolized by a separately placed esrog.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, it also answers the question, why esrog is one. When a person performs a mitzvah, s/he is exempt from other mitzvos. Esrog is like a heart, hinting that one's heart must be full with performing the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Also it ties well with the question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/117617/why-is-height-the-determining-factor-for-the-the-blessing-on-the-lulav\">why we make the blessing on lulav</a> as lulav symbolizes the Torah knowledge, our guidance in performing the mitzvah (hence it is the tallest).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) Perhaps, these analogies are also at play in the story of Adam and Chava in <em>Gan Eden</em> and their self-imposed stringency not to touch the tree of knowledge of good and evil (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.19.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 19:3</a>). Since the <em>Gan</em> was a spiritual place, its trees and their branches symbolized efforts to do mitzvos, and the mitzvos themselves were the fruit of the garden trees.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can excessive checking of an Esrog be considered nezek?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Here's the situation: Someone in a Shul is selling arba minim sets for the whole Shul. The Rav agreed to check them all. So I would assume there's a chezkas kashrus when I buy the set and I have no need to check it. Let's say I did check it, for some reason. And at first glance it looks fine, and it's only after extensive checking that I find a very subtle spot that turns out being a p'sul. Now, I would assume that if I had opened the box and found an obviously-passul esrog in there I would be able to get my money back from the distributor, no questions asked, because the chazaka vanishes right away. However, given that this p'sul wasn't so obvious and I found it only after checking very very carefully (surely not something I <em>needed</em> to do given the kashrus stamp the Rav gave), does the distributor have the right to demand money for damage I caused him? Surely I can't use this esrog and therefore should have the right to demand my money back from the distributor, and would give the passul esrog back to the distributor. But had I done the \"right\" thing by just accepting the esrog and not checking it excessively, I would have been able to use that esrog relying on the chezkas kashrus, and the only reason this esrog is passul is because of my excessive checking. Essentially, I caused the distributor's esrog to become passul. So does the disributor have the right to demand payment from me for damaging his esrog?</p>\n\n\n",

So, that’s why common practice is as you see, rather than making the blessing before picking up the <em>lulav</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Brachos are made at varying points in relation to the mitzvah being done. For example it's said after washing, it's said while putting on a tallis, it's said at the start of putting on tefilin, and it's said in regards to learning torah prior to learning anything. There are all unique reasons for why we say the bracha on each of the mitzvos. For lulav the fulfilling of the mitzvah is started by bringing the lulav and earog together and in the correct order. Seemingly if all species are not held together in the right order while shaking them you aren't fulfilling the mitzvah yet. Some want to already be holding all of the species when saying the bracha hence holding it upside down but will then change it at the last moment when bringing them together while others such as myself will only pick the esrog up after finishing the bracha. Either way the idea being to be able to bring the species together and wave them as close to saying the bracha as possible</p>\n\n\n",

During Yom Kippur I was unsure as to how to interpret Vayikra 16:30 (specifically, that neither the citizen nor resident alien that resides among israel should work). I am aware that I am obligated to break at least one melacha during each shabbat, but I was unaware of if I should break one on Yom Kippur. One of my friends from shul who converted suggested that I break just in case for Shabbat (if you are reading this in the future, Yom Kippur 5785 fell on Shabbat.) In the end though, I carried without an eruv to break this. In my opinion this would've been fine since the shul I went to has no eruv at the moment, and I am thinking that me leaving the shul would also thus mean I am no longer residing amongst am yisrael so than I could do my melacha just in case after I had left. But I do wonder this for the future since there is little chance that my conversion will be finished by next Yom Kippur (and I figured that I should ask this for future people with the same question). But I am wondering if I did this correctly? I think I did what would be the best option halachicly but I am wanting other people's opinions on this, both for next year's Yom Kippur and for anyone who may have this question in the future.

    "content": "# Did the death of the High Priest atone for sin and cleanse the land?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been studying up on Numbers 35, where it describes the issue of manslaughter and murder. If someone commits murder then they had to be put to death, but if it is found to be an accident (or perhaps there is just insufficient testimony) then the man-slaughterer could live out his days in one of the designated Cities of Refuge. There was no sacrifice or other payment that could redeem the life of the man-slaughterer.</p>\n<p>Despite it being an accident, the act of shedding another man's blood is still worthy of death - it still defiles the land; even the land of Israel where God was said to dwell among the people. Under the Noahide Covenant (Genesis 9), any time that a man killed another man (unlawfully), regardless of intentions or the presence of any animosity, it was required of society that they put that man to death:</p>\n<p>Genesis 9:6</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whoever sheds human blood,\nBy man his blood shall be shed,\nFor in the image of God\nHe made mankind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Numbers 35:30-34</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death on the testimony of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. 31 Moreover, you shall not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is condemned to death, but he must be put to death. 32 And you shall not accept a ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge, so that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest. 33 So you shall not defile the land in which you live; for blood defiles the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of the one who shed it. 34 So you shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the Lord am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of the shedding of human blood defiling the land hearkens back to when Cain slew Abel:</p>\n<p>Genesis 4:9-12</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” 10 Then He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground. 11 Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 12 When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Under the Law, <strong>the avenger of blood</strong> referred to the one who took on the role of killing a man-slaughterer (though the scriptures don't go into detail as far as selecting who this was as far as I can tell). Despite that this was a role that God requires of society, God also established the Cities of Refuge to show mercy to those who didn't kill intentionally or out of malice. And, what is more, upon the death of the High Priest all of the man-slaughterers were seemingly forgiven; they could return home without fear of being put to death by the avenger of blood, and with no more need to cleanse the land through their blood.</p>\n<p>Numbers 35:25-28</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the congregation shall save the one who committed manslaughter from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall return him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil. 26 But if at any time he goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he flees, 27 and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the blood avenger kills him, he will not be guilty of bloodshed, 28 because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the one who committed manslaughter may return to the land of his property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To get to my question then, I wanted to know how this phenomenon is understood within Judaism: did the life of the High Priest serve to atone for / cleanse the man-slaughterers? Did the High Priest's death serve to cleans the land? Or is something else going on here altogether? If not atonement, is there another term that would be used to describe this?</p>\n\n\n",

Recently, I encountered the verb להתעלם (to ignore), which comes from the same root (עלם) that also refers to youth or a young person (עלם/עלמה). Does anyone know if there’s a reason for the connection between being young and being ignorant or unaware?</p>\n<p>(One could also say that children/the youth often question things, are curious and eager to learn, and are also more emotionally driven, which is why they are more likely to lean towards activism)</p>\n<p>Toda raba!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The two roots are unrelated in Biblical Hebrew, even though they become homophonous in later Hebrew. There are two phonemes that correspond to the written letter ע: one is ʿayin (a voiced pharyngeal fricative, IPA: ʕ) and the other is ġayin (or ghayin; a voiced velar fricative — close to modern Israeli ר but not trilled, IPA: ɣ). Both sounds were present in Biblical Hebrew (for example, note the transliteration of Gomorrah for the city עֲמֹרָה, indicating an original ġayin), but due to the relatively limited writing system adopted by Hebrew speakers, some letters did double duty (the other famous one is ח for /x/ and /ħ/).</p>\n<p>The original root of the verb עלם meaning conceal (whence להתעלם) is with an ʿayin, and the original root of the nouns עֶלֶם and עַלְמָה is with a ġayin. For a source, you can look at The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament (HALOT). For עלם I, it lists cognates <em>ʿalama</em> in Arabic and Ethiopic, <em>ʿlm</em> in Ugaritic. For עלם III, it lists cognates <em>ġlm</em> in Ugaritic and <em>ġalima</em> in Arabic. (עלם II also comes from a ġayin, and means \"be darkened, black\", and appears in Job 42:3 as מעלים, perhaps as a variant of צלם.)</p>\n<p>So to sum up, the two roots <em>ʿlm</em> and <em>ġlm</em> are not related, even though they sound the same in later Hebrew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The root <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%9D_%E1%B4%B5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עלם</a> means to <em>hide</em>, <em>conceal</em>.

One year he accidentally forgot to put the Aravot in his Lulav-bundle and he only noticed after already shaking the deficient bundle and doing something else. He went and put the Aravot back in and blessed \"Al Netilat Arava\" (and Shehechiyanu since it was the first day) and shook the whole bundle again. His reasoning was the four species can in principle be taken sequentially instead of all together (Menachot 27a) so he only needs to bless on the remaining species, but it is better to take them all together so he picked them up together. (The story is quoted in Orchot Chaim (Lulav 22), in the Beit Yosef (651), and many later authorities.)</p>\n<p>Accordingly in your case, if you hadn't interrupted yet after blessing you can just pick up and add the missing myrtle branch, but if you did interrupt then the initial blessing can't cover the myrtle and you'd pick up the three myrtle branches (and ideally all the other species too) and bless \"Al Netilat Hadas\" (and Shehechiyanu on the first day).</p>\n<p>However, this assumes you actually need all 3 myrtle branches. That's a dispute in the Mishna (Sukkah 3:4) and while most authorities rule like the position that you need 3, Ramban rules you can suffice with 1 myrtle branch (cf. OC 651:1). Accordingly, if only one of the three myrtle branches was missing, you may have already fulfilled your obligation and should probably omit any further blessings out of doubt (especially since <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7921&st=&pgnum=143\" rel=\"noreferrer\">some later authorities</a> question Rabbeinu Meshullam's position entirely).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Even if all the minim were held at the same time, right side up, he has still not fulfilled the mitzva as it should be done, as is brought in Mishna berura 651:4</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וג' הדסים - אפילו שלשתן קטומים שנקטמו ראשן ופחות משלשה לא מהני אפילו לא היו קטומים</p>\n<p>And three myrtles - even if all three are cut, that their tops were cut; but less than three is not helpful (meaning, the mtizva isn't considered fulfilled), even if they were not cut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, it seems like one would need to retake the 4 minim to fulfill the mitzva. However, there is still the question regarding the bracha (assuming the previous bracha wouldn't work for this time, because of a hefsek - a break - between the bracha and the current taking of the minim). As was pointed out to me in the comments, the shulchan aruch goes on to say that if one doesn't have three hadassim, he should shake with one, which seems to say that bediavad one hadas is enough.</p>\n<p>The Kaf Hachayim there (seif katan 4) talks about this explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נטלו כל הקהל ולא היה בלולב אלא ב' הדסים, צריך לחזור וליטול לולב בג' הדסים ואין כאן משום מוקצה אך לא יברכו</p>\n<p>If the entire congregation took [the 4 minim] and there were only two myrtles, they must retake the minim with three myrtles, and there is no problem of Muktze, but <strong>they should not make a bracha</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(He quotes this in the name of the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1120&st=&pgnum=246\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis david</a>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7626&st=&pgnum=252\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">birkei yosef</a>, knesses hagdola, and shaarei teshuva)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Interestingly, the Kaf Hachayim goes on to talk about if someone was missing one of his Aravos, in which case he brings an opinion which says he should make another bracha, because having two Aravos is learned from the Torah. He still seems to lean towards not making a bracha, though.</p>\n\n\n",

Help him against his foes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Remarkably Rashi says that <em>Shema'Ya</em> (שמע יהוה) is Shimon's name! Tying back to the story of his birth to our foremother Leah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתַּ֣הַר עוֹד֮ וַתֵּ֣לֶד בֵּן֒ וַתֹּ֗אמֶר כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ כִּֽי־שְׂנוּאָ֣ה אָנֹ֔כִי וַיִּתֶּן־לִ֖י גַּם־אֶת־זֶ֑ה וַתִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ שִׁמְעֽוֹן׃</p>\n<p>And she conceived again and bore a son, and declared, “This is because יהוה heard that I was unloved so he has given me this one also”; so she named him Shimon: G!d heard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Besides the obvious connection between the names Yishma'EL-Shema'Ya-Shimon (God will hear, G!d hears, G!d has heard) and the interesteing coincidence that Yishma'El also has 12 tribes .... the biographers have tried to establish this connection between Shimon & Yishma'El</p>\n<p>Indeed as the Jewish Encylopedia records: \"Many attempts have been made to connect Simeon with Ishmael and Massa, and with the founders of Mecca\" <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13677-simeon-tribe-of\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> but it cites no source.</p>\n<p>So: is there more to this story and is Yishma'El Shimon and is Shimon Yishma'El?</p>\n\n\n",

Weaponization?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One who eats Pigul is Chayav Karet (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Zevachim.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim, Mishna 2:2</a>). There are several ways to create Pigul, but a simple case is such: Priest A is receiving the blood of a sacrificial animal, and he thinks about eating the meat of the same animal beyond its allotted time. One must discontinue the sacrificial service. But if the service is continued and certain conditions come true and the blood is sprinkled ... anyone who eats the meat of that sacrifice, even within the permitted time, receives Karet. Kohanim, however, are presumably scrupulous in their activities. Why would a Kohen do this?</p>\n<p>In fact, the Mishna in Gitin 5:4 states:</p>\n<p>הַכֹּהֲנִים שֶׁפִּגְּלוּ בַמִּקְדָּשׁ מְזִידִין, חַיָּבִין.Kohanim who intentionally create Pigul in the Temple are liable (for monetary damages to the owner of the sacrifice).</p>\n<p>The Yachin/Tiferet Yisrael states:</p>\n<p>מזידין\nשידע שמזיקו בזה:</p>\n<p>Intentionally (means) that he knew he would harm/ruin (the property of another via) this (act)</p>\n<p>The Yachin goes on to say:</p>\n<p>ונ״ל דלהכי לא נקיט ה״נ שוגגין פטורים, מדאינו מצוי שלא ידע הכהן שמפסיד הקרבן כשיפגלו ויהיה שוגג, דהרי למד דיני קרבן ה׳ שנים קודם שנכנס לעבודה. It appears to me that the reason that (the Mishna) did not similarly state (if Kohanim created Pigul)\"by accident they are not liable\", is because it is not common for a Kohen not to know that he ruins the sacrifice/property when he does Pigul (the case of accident does not normatively exist) for a Kohen studies the laws of sacrifices five years before initiating his service.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is clear that <em>accidental Pigul</em> is a misnomer and not part of the discussion; Kohanim knew about the ramifications and consequences of their sacrificial actions. What is the motive? A Kohen weaponizing a sacrifice - intentionally, on occasion, to thwart the penitence of another?</p>\n<p>The weaponization theory is not that far-fetched:</p>\n<p>בן ידיד הלכות גניבה פרק ב הלכה א\nכהנים שפגלו במקדש לחבירו הוא שהזיק כדי שיביא אחר או שלא יעשה רצונו שלא הביא דורון. Ben Ydid Laws of Theft, 2:1 - Kohanim who create Pigul in the Temple, he has harmed his friend in order to (force him) to bring another (sacrifice) or so that (God) not do his (friend's) will because he did not bring a gift.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to infer any motive from the actual Kohanim from that time. And I couldn't think of a description somewhere where Pigul has actually occurred, and than explained why it had occurred. We are left to infer.</p>\n<p>The Mishnah presents a scenario where a priest, who is ideally highly scrupulous, introduces an improper intent that could invalidate an entire sacrifice. Because Pigul requires intent we can rule out that the laws of Pigul is used to cover for any mistakes, or 'young trainee'-situations. Zevachim doesn’t elaborate much on why a Kohen might intentionally think improper thoughts during the sacrificial service, leaving us to wonder whether it was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A rare but real occurrence that needed a legal framework,</li>\n<li>More of a theoretical construct to safeguard the sanctity of the Temple rituals, or</li>\n<li>Addressing concerns about potential spiritual negligence or internal conflicts among even our most dedicated people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned in the comments by @Double_AA, even a momentary lapse in judgement for whatever personal reasons could create a situation of pigul; and the Mishna seems to (pre-emptively?) provide a legal framework for handling this for whenever it would occur.</p>\n<p>Without any known anecdotes we are left to imagine scenarios where even a Kohen Gadol would suffer a momentary lapse in judgement or succumb to a spiritual struggle, or chas weshalom act out of malicious intent.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, when you make a beracha to put on the tallis, you shouldn't speak u til you actually wore the tallis .</p>\n<p>In the case of the lulav, you shouldn't speak between the beracha and the נטילה. But keep in mind that the moment you hold all 4 species in the right direction (estrogen with the pittum side up) you were technically already yotze the mitzva. So talking thereafter, even while you are performing the minhag of shaking the lulav in all directions, isn't a problem, because it is not a hefsek between the berach and the mitzvah performance.</p>\n<p>See SA SA OC <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.651.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">651:5</a>, that one needs to make the beracha before holding the etrog the correct way, so that the beracha is made prior to being יוצא the mitzva.

Is there anything that would make this forbidden?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The main issue may possibly be the Gemara (Avodah Zarah 8a) that states that \"Jews in the Diaspora worship idolatry in purity\". What does this mean? When a Gentile makes a personal celebration (like a wedding for their child), he invites Jews to the party and they attend. Even though they eat their own kosher food, the Torah considers it as if they are eating idolatrous sacrifices from the host. It says, “Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and one of them invites you and you eat of his sacrifice” (Ex. 34:15). The end of the verse implies that you may not accept an invitation from an idolater and, if you do, it is as if you are eating from his idolatrous sacrifice.</p>\n<p>This being said- it is quite possible that these aren’t really \"religious\" celebrations. Most large companies nowadays try to accommodate people of all religions and do not have explicitly religious celebrations. These “holiday” parties and are entirely secular. If something even remotely religious happens, like singing Christmas carols or someone entering dressed as Santa Claus, I would possibly leave (Although I’m not convinced that either of the two examples I mentioned are actually religious). But really we are just talking about a neutral holiday party.</p>\n<p>Gentiles today do not worship idolatry and, even if they do, they do not thank their god that a Jew who works in their legal department attended a mandatory business party.</p>\n<p>People may get very offended if Jews as a group, or even religious Jews as a group, refuse to go to the company’s holiday party. The company spends a lot of money on what they consider to be a morale booster and if you refuse to participate, especially after they make certain that there is nothing religiously offensive and glatt kosher food is available, you are undermining company morale and offending executives.</p>\n<p>sources for more details:</p>\n<p>Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh De’ah 152:1)- see discussions of shach and Taz of biblical or rabbinic.</p>\n<p>Rav Menasheh Klein (Mishneh Halakhos 7:118)  rules like Taz (not allowed)</p>\n<p>Levush explicitly rules that eivah (offending) overrides the prohibition against attending a Gentile party (to which the Taz objects)</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Iggeros Moshe, Yoreh De’ah 2:117) seems to rule like Shach, allowing it in cases of eivah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R.

Something similar is related in the Talmud, tractate Shabbat, folio 134, where Rabbi Nathan relates that he once met a lady who had lost two of her children as a result of circumcision. She asked him if she had to circumcise her third son also and risk losing him too. When Rabbi Nathan looked at the infant, he noted that his skin looked extremely red. He therefore told his mother to wait with circumcising him until this red skin would become normal looking. She did so, and circumcised him in due course and he survived without further problem. When Yitzchok waited a year or two for the skin colour of Esau to change and it did not happen, he assumed that this son was going to remain in that condition, but he still did not circumcise him. When he turned 13, he still restrained himself from circumcising him. He had waited all this time thinking that seeing he had not been circumcised at the age of eight days he would circumcise him at the age Yishmael had been circumcised. This is what was meant in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 35,6: אם לא דם שנאת ודם ירדפך, “surely though you have hated blood, blood shall pursue you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, the midrash Bereshis Rabba 76:9 states in affirmative that Eisav was circumcised:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He arose during that night and he took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Yabok” (Genesis 32:23).\n“He arose during that night and he took his two wives, and his two maidservants…” – but where was Dina? He placed her in a chest and locked it with her in it. He said: ‘This wicked one has a covetous eye; [I do this] so he will not direct his eyes, see her, and take her from me.’\nRav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Abba HaKohen Bardela: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘“For the sake of one who deprives his neighbor of kindness” (Job 6:14) – you withheld kindness from your neighbor, you withheld kindness from your brother. Had she married the man, she would not have engaged in licentiousness.  <strong>You did not seek to marry her to a circumcised man, so she married an uncircumcised man.</strong> You did not seek to marry her in a permitted fashion, so she married in a prohibited fashion.’ That is what is written: “Dina daughter of Leah…went out” (Genesis 34:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is resolved with the help of the commentary Yefeh Toar on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yefeh_To%27ar_on_Bereshit_Rabbah.76.9.3?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah,_Vilna,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 76.9.3</a>. The full published version by Machon Aharon states (unlike Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have a difficulty, above in p. 63:18 Eisav hates the blood of milla, i.e. consequently he was ערל (uncircumcized), and we cannot apply there principle that ערלי/uncircumcized of Israel are called מהולים/circumcized (as in mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Nedarim.3.11?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 3:11</a>), thus what we explained there - is fitting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By Sefaria numbering, the reference is midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.63.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 63:13</a> (Sefaria uses different enumeration as compared to the edition of the midrash). The relevant words there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did Esau hate blood? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is the blood of birthright and offerings. <strong>Rabbi Levi said: זה דם מילה - This is the blood of circumcision.</strong> The Rabbis said: You hated a person’s blood in his body. That is what is written: “He loved curses, and they will now come upon him. [He had no desire for blessing, and it will now be far from him]” (Psalms 109:17).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Explans Yefeh Toar (in the Machon Aharon edition):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זה דם מילה: he pulled his orla, and all his children were uncircumcized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as person's <em>religious status</em>, in Judaism either a person believes in G-d, or is a follower of Avodah Zara (foreign worship - anything but G-d).

Many years ago, someone came to me, lamenting about thoughts of heresy, heaven forbid. I told him what is mentioned in the holy books about reciting the Song of Ha'azinu, and he did so for several consecutive years. He later informed me that he was completely saved from these thoughts. May G-d help us for the sake of His Name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What exactly is it about the Shir Ha'azinu that dispells heretical thoughts from a person? Are there any meforshim or sources that discuss this? Why especially Ha'azinu?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a fascinating article <a href=\"https://www.jdn.co.il/beit_hamidrash/1834799/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which relates an amazing story about the Ramban and a student of his that became a heretic. Whilst the student starting by mocking his Rebbe, eventually they got talking about what made him reject yiddishkeit in its entirety. The student responded, “I heard from you that all the events from the creation of the world to the coming of the Moshiach, including the private things that will happen to every man of Israel, are all implied in the song of Haazinu. This seemed impossible to me and made me doubt everything I had learned from you.”</p>\n<p>With this as an introduction, the article goes on to note that the Rebbe Rayetz also brings down the segula (refer to his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58821&st=&pgnum=131&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Zichronos, cheilek alef, p. 125 4th par</a>) and the article notes a tentative reason behind why Shiras Haazinu carries so much weight...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרבי מליובאוויטש מבאר, כי שירת האזינו מהווה מכלול שלם של דרך חיים. החל מחסדי ה’ איתנו, דרך הפניית עורף מצידנו, התוצאה שנגרמת ממעשינו – ועד לגאולה העתידית. חלק התוכחה הם גם כן חלק מהשירה הכללית, ולא ניתן להתעלם, כאשר בוחנים את מסלול החיים המלא, מהקטעים הפחות נעימים. גם בהם, בגאולה העתידה, יתגלה כי הכל היה לטובה.</p>\n<p>בסופו של דבר, השירה כולה מלמדת אותנו כי ‘הצור תמים פעלו’. גם כאשר ישנם מאורעות שאיננו מבינים, מדובר בתהליך שעלינו לעבור עד לגאולה העתידית, אז נגלה כי הכל היה לטובה. “א-ל אמונה ואין עול, צדיק וישר הוא”.</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains that the Song of Haazinu constitutes a complete whole way of life. Starting from G-d's grace with us, through our turning away, the result of our actions – and up to the future redemption. The parts of the rebuke are also part of the general poem, and we cannot ignore, when examining the full course of life, the less pleasant parts. Even in them, in the future redemption, it will be revealed that everything was for the best.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the entire poem teaches us that ‘The Rock — whose deeds are perfect.’ Even when there are events that we do not understand, it is a process that we must go through until the future redemption, when we will discover that everything was for the best. “A faithful G-d, never false, true and upright indeed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So possibly one can suggest that since the whole song is rooted in the essence of life and alludes to G-d's all-powerful Omnipresence, that runs counter to any heretical thought.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Upon researching further, the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/?lang=en#/book/141600/p/-1/t/60684/fs/m_bccA5BBVe0pmPd3Jn1zsEwukgfYN8Hsy7MFFF0Yi5b/start/22/end/24/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chikrei Minhagim (cheilek beis</a>) brings down all the sources for the regular recitation of Haazinu, and notes a further idea that would perhaps answer this question (see over the page from the subtitle - \"הפלאתה של פרשת האזינו\" - \"The wonder of Parshas Haazinu\")</p>\n<p>It notes that it is quoted in the name of the Ramban<sup>1</sup> that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלולים כל המצוות וכל הדברים שבעולם</p>\n<p>All the commandments and all the things in the world are included (in Parshas Haazinu).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Haazinu is significant.

    "title": "Can We Use Our Reward In The Next World Like Money In This World?",
    "content": "# Can We Use Our Reward In The Next World Like Money In This World?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A story about the Vilna Ga’on appears in Halachic Man (on p.30 in the 1984 English edition). I feel like I’ve heard essentially the same story many times, told about various historical figures, although I cannot now remember. In Halachic Man, the author refers to the story as a folk legend.</p>\n<p>In the story, the Vilna Ga’on is unable to obtain Hadassim that he needs to perform one of the commandments of Sukkot. He sends people out to search, and Hadassim are found, growing in a particular woman’s yard. She agrees to sell them to the Vilna Ga’on, but the price that she demands is the reward that the Vilna Ga’on should receive for performing the Mitzvah. He agrees to the price and is, surprisingly, very happy when performing the Mitzvah on these terms. He explains that he is now able to perform the Mitzvah not for the sake of receiving a reward.</p>\n<p>I have several problems with this story.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the internal logic, it seems strange that Hadassim are growing in this woman’s yard but no place else. The climate and soil permit cultivation, and need for Hadassim on Sukkot should have taken nobody by surprise.</li>\n<li>Also in the internal logic, there seems to be no reason for the Vilna Ga’on to have been happy on this particular occasion, if he could have made the same arrangement on every occasion. Similarly, if any of you would like to assign to me all of the reward for your performance of Mitzvos, you need only say the word.</li>\n<li>Stepping outside of the internal logic now, how could our reward in the next world be like money that we can spend in this world? Could we set up an economy on this basis, paying for groceries and babysitting with a share of our reward in the next life? Could a rich man go around to all of the poor people, buying their reward on the cheap, depending only on their misfortune in needing money? This way of thinking about reward is repellant in that it undermines the justice of reward and punishment, which is seemingly the whole point of reward and punishment.</li>\n<li>The Vilna Ga’on died in 1797. The original Hebrew text of Halachic man was published in 1944. The English edition that I saw provides no source for the story.</li>\n<li>I cannot think of any old telling of any comparable story. For example, in the story (Avodah Zarah 18) about the execution of Chanania Ben Tradyon, someone sacrifices his own life to help, after assurance that he will receive a share in the world to come, and the story then assures us that he did receive that reward. And in the relationship between Zevulun and Issachar that Rashi mentions (Gen 49:13, Deut 33:18), Zevulun works to support Issachar in learning; and everyone I ask seems to understand some sort of implication for the reward each party receives. But in these stories, everyone is genuinely doing something meritorious, and the reward could simply by commensurate with the desert. That seems clearly not the intention in the story of the Vilna Ga’on. In the Vilna Ga’on story, the idea seems to be that the woman is receiving more reward than her actions really recommend, simply because she drove a hard bargain; and her reward is at the expense of the party actually deserving of the reward, so that nobody seems to be getting reward according to his merit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, I ask you.</p>\n<p>Can you point me to authoritative sources for this idea that while we live, we can use our future reward as money for the payment of our bills, so that in the end these arrangements will actually transfer reward from the otherwise deserving party to the otherwise undeserving party? Is there any way to improve the provenance of this Vilna Ga’on story, or comparable “Gedolim” stories? Are there relevant ancient, medieval or Renaissance versions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The premise behind your question is logically compelling. How can 'future reward' be transferred from one to another like a form of currency? And, indeed, there are numerous sources - most notably, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_ben_Sherira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Hai Gaon</a> [quoted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Alashkar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharam Alashkar</a> (Siman 101) and cited by R' Akiva Eger (Hil. Talmud Torah)], who decry the concept of buying or selling reward.</p>\n<p>Your question asks for authoritative sources for such a concept. If you accept the Vilna Gaon as authoritative, you probably will be happy with a source from his disciple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_of_Volozhin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Chaim Volozhin</a>. In Ruach Chaim (commentary to Avos, 1:1) R' Chaim Volozhin tells the story of the author of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_HaLevi_Segal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Turei Zahav</a> (known as the 'Taz'), who 'donated' the reward of one study session to a sick child, who recovered in that merit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JpYCwJG2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JpYCwJG2.png\" alt=\"Ruach Chaim 1:1\" /></a></p>\n<p>A century before the Taz (1586-1667), Shiltei Giborim (d. 1557) in his glosses to Rif (Baba Kama 32b) indicates this idea - that one can effectively sell his divine reward for money - although he provides a caveat that the sale takes place prior to performing the <em>mitzvah</em>. [See, however, Shu\"t Meishiv Davar 14 for a different understanding].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולפ\"ז יעלה יפה מה שכתבתי <strong>דאדם יכול למכור המצות שלו ויעלו לאיש הקונה</strong>\nדהא יש להם ערך י' זהובים לאחר מיהו נראה דוקא מועיל הקנין במצוה שעתיד\nלעשות אבל לא במצוה שעשה כבר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imrei Binah (Responsa, Siman 13) attempts to reconcile the opinions by differentiating between two types of 'divine reward'.

However it seems to be more or less universal among those who say Morid HaTal to say it with a kamatz under the tess (Morid HaT-uh-l instead of Morid HaT-ah-l). Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach is quoted in a Dirshu Mishna Brurah note in Siman 114 as saying it should be a patach but every siddur I've seen has it as a kamatz. Assuming there's basis for pronouncing Tul with a kamatz, which indicates that whatever line you're saying before Mechalkel is separate and has a stoppage before Mechalkel, why would you say Morid HaGeshem with a segol, which implies the line continues into Mechalkel? As it happens, R' SZ Aurbach is quoted in that same Dirshu note as saying it should be Geshem with a segol, so the question would not be on him, but most siddurim have the pronunciation of Geshem with a segol and Tul with a Kamatz.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This answer is from <em>Emes L'Yaakov Al HaTorah</em>, p. מ״ו-מ״ז.</p>\n<p>First of all, it seems the custom of the Stoliner Chasidim is indeed to say \"tal\" with a patach, as you would have expected.</p>\n<p>But the reason to differentiate between \"geshem\" and \"tul\" is that \"tul\" goes with the previous phrase and ends it, because \"tul\" is involved in the mechanism of techiyas hameisim (cf. Isaiah 26:19), whereas \"geshem\" is at the beginning of a list of other gevuros of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Mishnaic Hebrew, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segolate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">segolates</a> completely lack a pausal form. Their vowels remain the same regardless of their position in a sentence. When the phrase משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם was first instituted, the final word was pronounced הַגֶּשֶׁם, without a <em>Kamatz</em>.</p>\n<p>There’s a wider debate regarding whether blessings and parts of the liturgy that were authored using Mishnaic Hebrew, should be pronounced as if they were written using Biblical Hebrew. That debate is the same reason that, in the blessing over wine, most Ashkenazim say הַגָּפֶן with a <em>Kamatz</em>, while Sephardim pronounce it with two <em>Segol</em>s.</p>\n<p>The reason most Ashkenazim pronounce הגשׁם with a <em>Kamatz</em>, is because it probably <em>does</em> come at the end of a sentence; thus, if it were Biblical Hebrew, we would all pronounce it with a <em>Kamatz</em>. However, as mentioned, the word’s position didn’t matter in Mishnaic Hebrew.</p>\n<p>This debate does <em>not</em> apply to the word הַטָּל. In the summer months, the entire phrase of משיב הרוח is replaced by מוריד הטל. If the word “הגשׁם” is at the end of a sentence, so is הטל. A stressed <em>Patach</em> vowel, unlike segolates, <em>does</em> have a pausal form in Mishnaic Hebrew, in which the <em>Patach</em> lengthened to a <em>Kamatz</em>.</p>\n<p>Thus, according to the majority opinion that this phrase occurs at the end of a sentence, the word הטל would have a <em>Kamatz</em>. According to the minority opinion that it instead begins the next sentence, it would have a <em>Patach</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

In this case, although one who forgot Afikoman must wash again, the obligation is not certain, as per Shulchan Aruch O”C 477:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם שכח ולא אכל אפיקומן ולא נזכר… עד אחר שבירך בורא פרי הגפן לא יאכל האפיקומן ויסמוך על מצה שאכל בתוך הסעוד' שכולן שמורות הן משעת לישה. אבל במקום שנהגו לעשו' שימור למצת מצוה משע' קצירה אפילו לא זכר עד אחר ההלל יטול ידיו ויברך המוציא ויאכל האפיקומן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If one already made a brachah on the wine before remembering the Afikoman, one need not wash again and instead relies on the Matzah he already ate.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the obligation to re-wash is a safek, in which case we do not repeat Birkas Hamazon. (Since the biblical obligation of Birkas Hamazon was already fulfilled. However, in general if one is unsure whether he said Yaaleh V’yavo it is not considered a safek, as it is assumed that he did not.)</p>\n<p>The question would, however, remain in the latter case of the S”A quoted, which rules that one has until now only eaten Matzah that is shemurah mishaas ketzirah must wash again.</p>\n<p>Here, one is certainly obligated to eat bread. The question, then, would be: is this special status given to any seudah one is personally obligated to eat, or is it limited to the amount of seudos the <em>day</em> requires one to eat?</p>\n<p>[The M”B quoted above seems to suggest the latter understanding (<em>“…since the chiyuv of Birkas Hamazon is fixed in these days…”</em>), while the Magen Avraham he quotes points to a more individual chiyuv. See Shaarei Teshuvah 291:1 and the Machzik Brachah that he references, who opines that a seudah must be both required and usual in order to warrant re-bentching.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Evening Too is a Time to Perform Mitzvot; How, Without Tzizit, do we Effectively Remember/Trigger Their Performance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Premise #1: Mitzvot are performed by day and night. This idea really needs no proof, but I cite a Kesef Mishna (Laws of Shema 1:2) nonetheless:\n\"לפי שמעשה המצות שנזכר בוהיה אם שמוע נוהג בין ביום בין בלילה\" - \"the performance of Mitzvot that is mentioned in the second paragraph of Shema occurs by day and night...\"</p>\n<p>Premise #2: Tzizit's purpose is to remind us to perform the mitzvot; the Tzizit-reminder only occurs by day. The same Kesef Mishna:   וזכירת המצות שעל ידי ציצית שנזכר בויאמר אינו נוהג אלא ביום\" - the Mitzvot reminder via Tzizit that is mentioned in the third paragraph of Shema only operates during the day\"</p>\n<p>Premise #3: the reason that the reminder mechanism of Tzizit can only be utilized by day is because one can only see Tzizit via daylight (and not in the dark). Duh!</p>\n<p>Premise #4: ONLY the seeing of Tzizit (wearing a rubber band on your wrist or uttering verses of the Torah or utilizing sticky notes are NOT fully effective Mitzvot reminders) triggers an effective Mitzvot-reminder that, in turn, leads to the performance of Mitzvot: (Menachot 43b and Lechem Mishna cited below).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותניא אידך וראיתם אותו וזכרתם ועשיתם ראיה מביאה לידי זכירה זכירה מביאה לידי עשיה And it is taught in another baraita: The verse states: “That you may look upon IT and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them.” This teaches that looking at the ritual fringes leads to remembering the mitzvot, and remembering them leads to doing them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Lechem Mishna sums up this Premise #4 well: כיון שאין הזכירה באה אלא ע״י ציצית כמש״ה וראיתם אותו וזכרתם “Since the remembering <em>ONLY</em> comes via tzizit as it states ‘you shall see them and remember …’”</strong></p>\n<p>Question - evening too is a time to perform Mitzvot; how, without Tzizit, do we remember and thus trigger an evening performance? Put it another way - why did God create a daytime-only reminder for Mitzvot that occur day and night?</p>\n<p><em>A possible answer - a dose of a daytime, visual Tzizit Mitzvot-reminder is sufficient to last through the evening too.\nThoughts?</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, several of the comments below fail to account for the Gemarra and Lechem Mishna cited here which support Premise #4 - Lechem Mishna (Gimmel):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8E3HT0o.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8E3HT0o.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Since you're asking for thoughts and not sources:</p>\n<p>During the day you can see your Tzizit, but you also see everything else, hence you are constantly being distracted. Tzizit are there to help you refocus.</p>\n<p>During the night you cannot see anything, and thus can concentrate on the task at hand. No need for Tzizit to refocus. Keeping in mind that when you can't see anything, you can't do much; you either sleep or use candlelight for specific tasks.</p>\n<p>A final thought: Chazal teach us (Eruvin 65a) that the night was created for learning Torah, and while learning there is no need for constant reminders to do Mitzvot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One can use the same idea as expressed in Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.43b.10?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 43b</a> in a slightly different context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages taught in a baraita: The Jewish people are beloved, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, surrounded them with mitzvot: They have <em>tefilin</em> on their heads, and <em>tefilin</em> on their arms, and <em>tzitzis</em> on their garments, and a mezuza for their doorways. Concerning them David said: “Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous ordinances” (Psalms 119:164). This alludes to the two <em>tefilin</em>, the four <em>tzitziot</em>, and the <em>mezuza</em>, which total seven.</p>\n<p>And when David entered the bathhouse and saw himself standing naked, he said: Woe to me that that I stand naked without any mitzva. But once he remembered the mitzva of circumcision that was in his flesh his mind was put at ease, as he realized he was still accompanied by this mitzva. After he left the bathhouse, he recited a song about the mitzva of circumcision, as it is stated in the verse: “For the leader, on the Sheminith: A Psalm of David” (Psalms 12:1). This is interpreted as a psalm about circumcision, which was given to be performed on the eighth [bashemini] day of the baby’s life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point here that we actually have 8 markers to remind us about all the mitzvos. <em>Tefilin</em> and <em>mezuzah</em> contain parshios, such as 2 paragraphs of Shema', that have requirement of performance of mitzvos by day and by night just like the <em>tzitzis</em> by day. We still have mezuzos on doorposts of our houses at night. Also <em>bris-millah</em> is a reminder by virtue of gematria ברי\"ת = 612, i.e. it is itself a mitzvah and reminds us about other 612.</p>\n\n\n",

Whether or not this is compatible with free will is a different question. This is also not the question about foreknowledge because a prophet could know what someone will do in the future as well, so the real issue is not knowing the future but being the First Cause.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a general working answer that is \"followed\" by \"many\" today, to whatever end one can be said to \"follow\" a <em>hashkafa</em>, and I don't have estimates on numbers and percentages, but I do know that many in the Chareidi world, including Chabad, consider this the Jewish take on this question. This is the crux of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Tanya</a>, for example, and the schools of thought that stem from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.8.80?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Zohar</a>, and beyond.</p>\n<p>The way it works is, every person is given a specific mission in life, and one major component of that mission, for most people, is one's work with one's own <em>yeitzer hara</em>. There are 2 things you need to know about this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each has their own unique <em>yeitzer hara</em></li>\n<li>There are 2 categories (broken in to further sub-categories, up to 5 depending on how you count) for achievement in this arena</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Regarding 1</strong>, a person's unique <em>yeitzer hara</em> corresponds to a specific, unique set of illicit behaviours, and the reason a person is tempted by those behaviours, is because it gives them pleasure. Their job is to avoid performing those activities, and tame the passion for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding 2</strong>, some achievements can be total, permanent victories, and some are lifetime's work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regarding the lifetime's work category, there are some who are all-but-destined to succumb and perform the illicit activities, and their job is to never give up, and work hard to still try to tame their <em>yeitzer hara</em>, by doing teshuva and doing their best to limit the activity, and even conquer it one day. The conquest, however, will be a ceasefire, rather than a victory, as they will always be tempted. The other group in this category never sin, but are also, always tempted.</li>\n<li>Regarding the total victory category, some are able to actually tame their passions for only good. Some of us can do this on an individual level, for specific temptations, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38301/how-did-david-slay-his-evil-inclination\">very few people</a> achieve the ability to do it for all their temptations, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim.26.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">with Hashem's help</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This brings us to the last 2 cases. Someone born a Tzaddik, and someone born a total Rasha. Some people are indeed born without any temptation, and some are born <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/139942/freewill-or-gods-plan\">destined to be wicked tyrants</a>, like Hitler, y'sh. This is ok, because exceptions to rules is an acceptable Torah principle, and if one delves into the reasons offered by the commentaries for both of these categories, one will nonetheless encounter some resolutions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/132656/31534\">A Tzaddik does have free will still</a>, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/140362/31534\">free will</a> takes on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136817/31534\">a different form</a> without a <em>yeitzer hara</em> (we will have free will in the days of Moshiach). This might also be true of certain Rashaim, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/135010/who-is-amalek-in-2023/135459#135459\">like Haman</a>.</li>\n<li>There is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37079/what-does-it-mean-that-god-hardened-pharaoh-s-heart\">a principle that Hashem takes away free will from leaders</a>, in order to be the Master of History.</li>\n<li>It's not always a total statement. Most of us are in a state of victory on some behaviours, ceasefire on others, and still struggling to stop doing yet others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It turns out that the question of free will leads to a very rich tapestry of a picture, which is a global human mission that Hashem has tasked us, which has a zoomed in version of our own life story and free will, and relationship with Hashem, as well as the macroscopic picture of the entire Human Spirit - each of us with our little corner of the \"human life force\" that we are all individually working on, battling our <em>yeitzer hara</em>, for the benefit of all of humanity. The rewards of this will be revealed at a later time, when we are able to see what we achieved, and note that the Jewish people have been given the Torah, which means we have taken on full responsibility for this task, and will guarantee it is fully achieved, with Hashem's help, in time for Moshiach.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Most people have definitely got free will, but one does have to understand that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.13.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hashem tests man</a>, and this leads to interesting things like \"destined/very very likely to sin\" etc. Some people seem like either exceptions, or special edges cases.

for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.\nFor what nation is there so great, that has God so near to them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?\nAnd what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this Tora, which I set before you this day?\n<strong>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons—\nthe day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Ḥorev, when the Lord said to me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.</strong>\nAnd you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.\nAnd the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no form; only a voice.\nAnd he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform...<br />\n<strong>But the Lord has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Miżrayim, to be to him a people of inheritance, as you are this day.</strong>\nBut the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Yarden, and that I should not go in to that good land, which the Lord thy God gives thee for an inheritance:\nbut I must die in this land, I must not go over the Yarden: but you shall go over, and possess that good land.\n**Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a carved idol, or the likeness of anything, which the Lord thy God has forbidden thee.\nFor the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.\nWhen thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall deal corruptly, and make a carved idol, the likeness of anything, and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger:<br />\n<strong>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land into which you go over the Yarden to possess it; you shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.\nAnd the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where the Lord shall lead you.\nAnd there you shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.\nBut if from there thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\nWhen thou art in distress, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and art obedient to his voice;\n(for the Lord thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, nor will he destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he swore to them.</strong>\nFor ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or whether aught has been heard like it?\nDid ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?\nOr has God ventured to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Miżrayim before your eyes?\nTo thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside him.\nOut of heaven he made thee hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire.\nAnd because he loved thy fathers, therefore, he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out, he himself being present, with his mighty power out of Miżrayim;\nto drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.\n<strong>Know therefore this day, and consider it in thy heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is no other.\nThou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayst prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God gives thee, for ever.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is also the closing message of the last of the prophets, Malachi (ch. 3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then they who feared the Lord spoke to one another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for those who feared the Lord, and took heed of his name.\nAnd they shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts, on that day which I appoint as my particular day; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.\nThen you shall return, and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that does not serve him.\nFor, behold, that day is coming; it burns like a furnace; and all the arrogant, and all who do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that is coming shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.\nBut to you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go out, and leap like calves from the stall.\nAnd you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this, says the Lord of hosts. <strong>Remember the Tora of Moshe my servant, which I commanded him in Ḥorev for all Yisra᾽el, both statutes and judgments.\nBehold, I will send you Eliyya, the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:\nand he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the land with a curse.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Malachi describes the final day of judgement in history, and says to remember the Torah of Moshe until that day, for those that do will be rewarded, and those that don't will be punished. This means that the Torah is binding until the end of time, with the return of Elijah the prophet. This message is specifically chosen as the end of the words of the prophets. In a way, it is G-d's final direct message to us.</p>\n\n\n",

This is just patently not true, according to the Baal Shem Tov.</p>\n<p>Therefore, who are we to question His statement that the sun stopped?

Yes, it does seem superfluous/unnecessary for the humans to say they will build a city for themselves, because afterall, who else would they build it for?</p>\n<p>For me that statement is rather a reflection that mankind is no longer interested in following God's orders. God created the earth, all the plants and animals, created a beautiful garden, created humans and asked humans to protect the gardens and to be a ruler/caretaker of all the animals.</p>\n<p>We blow it in the garden. We are no longer obligated to guard the garden. Now we will be farmers, but we are still obligated to be fruitful and multiply, to bring <strong>positive</strong> human dominion over the whole Earth like God commanded. We were not bringing this positive human dominion over the Earth, so God flooded the Earth and restored Noah to being a ruler over animals, saving most of the animals, and allowing noah and his descendants to eat animals in ritually acceptable way after the flood. If Noah's descendants had continued to be farmers (grapes/wine anyone?) and leaders of the animals then all would have been good.</p>\n<p>Instead, the tower of Babel is humanity deciding not to expand and rule over the whole Earth like God asked. Rather, they asked themselves what they wanted, and the answer was a city with a tower that reached toward heaven. Humanity had chosen to replace God's desires, with humans desires, which was always the risk of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. They wanted safety and security, they wanted houses, and a tower that might reach toward God. And so their statement of let us build a city for ourselves, reads to me as \"let us not fill the earth and subdue it [like God commanded], let us not rule over the animals [in the wild as God commanded]. Rather, let us build a [safe] city, not for God, but for ourselves, and build a tower that reaches to the heavens.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Midrash makes Nimrod the king who built the tower.

Or \"Shlomo has the din of a mazik and has to pay damages.\"</p>\n<p><em>Halacha</em> is the accepted way of doing things. It is based on Mitzvah, oral law/interpretations, and customs. It's the polished mitzvah and can differ vastly from the raw mitzvah. For example, we have a mitzvah to cut off the hand of a woman who grabs a ballsack of two men who are fighting. The halacha is that she only pays a monetary fine.</p>\n<p>Sometimes halacha refers to a detail of another halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Akhenaten, Monotheism, King Paro, and Midrashim\n\n## Frage\n\n<h3>Background and Reason I am Asking</h3>\n<p>I would like to know if there is any reason to believe, or disbelieve, that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akhenaten</a> might have been the Pharaoh that faced the plagues. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/137473/31534\">According to the Midrash, he did teshuva</a>, and began trying to spread monotheism.</p>\n<p>According to historians, Akhenaten also was the first Pharaoh that started spreading (at least a form of) monotheism, and many of the descriptions of the deity he insisted Egypt worship sound eerily similar to many of the Torah's descriptions of Hashem (see Great Hymn to the Aten vs Psalm 104). It's also crazy that someone was able to pull off such a massive and fast change in the religion of the great and very ancient empire of Egypt, for the first time in thousands of years, so fast and so successfully!</p>\n<p>There's also the interesting matter that his reign is very coincident with the Exodus, approx 3350 years ago!</p>\n<p>[I understand that the academic, cynic's and atheist's reflex would be (and has been ad nauseum) to reverse things, and say Judaism evolved/absorbed material from Akhenaten's religion in some way, but of course that is not what Traditional Judaism holds.]</p>\n<h3>Question:</h3>\n<p>Within the rubrick of traditional Judaism, is there any reason to believe that Akhenaten was [or was directly connected to] the King Pharaoh of the Exodus, and that his move to create this new, monotheistic-ish religion was because of what our sages said - he did teshuva after the plagues?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>I don't trust myself to research this, I would much rather hear from an orthodox scholar who has already researched it, or knows how to research it properly. <strong>It would also be interesting and relevant to look into discussions on whether worshiping Aten has been analyzed as counting as Avoda Zara/Shittuf etc. or not, perhaps?</strong></sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Akhenaten knew Psalm 104 and was a contemporary of Yehoshua's conquest</li>\n<li>The Exodus occured in the 7th year of Thutmose III of the 18th dynasty, which ruled over the Middle Kingdom.</li>\n<li>The Exodus events took place in the Nile Delta, ruled by dynasties 4-6.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>According to the book \"<a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/pharaoh/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharaoh</a>\" by R. Alexander Hool, p. 59-60, the Hymn of the Sun-Disc carved into the neckropolis of Akhenaten bears a striking resemblance to the Psalm 104 written by king David, who lived many years after Exodus. Based on Bava Basra 14b, we have to conclude that Psalm 104 was written by Moshe and modified to its final version later by king David.</p>\n<p>The synchronization of the Egyptian history proposed by R. Hool places Exodus in the 7th year of Thutmose III of the 18th dynasty. Officially, Thutmose III ruled for 54 years, afterwards there was Amenhotep II (25 years), Thutmose IV (8 years), Amenhotep III (38 years), followed by Amenhotep IV Akhenaten who ruled for 17 years. Official dating of 18th dynasty would place Exodus 119 years prior to Akhenaten. However, in the Amarna letters there is a request from Abdu-Heba king of Jerusalem that pharaoh Akhenaten IV help against invading Hapiru/Apiru. If this is a reference to invading army of Yehoshua, we must conclude that Amenhotep IV Akhenaten was a contemporary to the later years of Moshe when his version of Psalm 104 was available, so that Akhenaten could know it. This synchronization allows resolving many historical enigmas well-known in the academic world.</p>\n<p>Why Thutmose III was contemporary of Exodus? According to historian Manetho, Exodus occured under pharaoh Tutimaos. First 6 years of his reign Thutmose III co-reigned with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut, who in an inscription speaks of \"wandering people\" that caused ruination of Egypt and left Egypt in her time. The mummy of Thutmose II showed that he died suddenly in his 30s evidently from a plaque of <strong>boils</strong> engulfed on his entire body. The mummy of Thutmose III also bears the same scars, and so does Queen Hatshepsut's and another contemporary.</p>\n<p>The problem is that 18th dynasty in the 7th year of Thutmose III only ruled over the Middle Egypt, but events of the Exodus occured in the Nile Delta. It took Thutmose III several years to conquer all of Egypt and then expand his war campaign into Canaan. The 15th dynasty of Hyksos (likely the Amalekites) ruled the Delta for some time after Exodus.</p>\n<p>It turns out that in the southwest corner of the festive hall of Thutmose III there is a well known Karnak King list which is at variance with the conventional as it mentions kings Teti, Pepi I, and Merenre from the 6th dynasty among those of 11th and 12th dynasty kings. Based on considerations given in the book, it turns out that indeed the Nile Delta was ruled by the 6th dynasty, and the Pharaoh of Exodus was the last king Neferkare the Younger (ruled 1 year), when the dynasty was suddenly interrupted. R. Hool believes that kings of 4-6th dynasties were rulling in the Delta for the duration of the Egyptian Exile of the Jewish people and he explains that they were Edomite kings, i.e. related to the rulers of Edom, which also fits well with the assumption of that they were Hyksos. It may also shed light on why both Edomite and Egyptian converts needed 4 generations to marry into Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ramses I ruled after Akhenaten. One of the towns the Jews built was called Ramses so it is unlikely that Akhenaten was the Pharaoh of the Exodus.</p>\n<p>Further, Akhenaten was deliberately obscured and only rediscovered in the 19th century. He is unlikely to feature in any classical Rabbinic literature.</p>\n\n\n",

Avraham ibn Ezra).</p>\n<p>Onkelos translates Bereishis 3:1 as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְחִוְיָא הֲוָה חֲכִים מִכֹּל חַיַּת בָּרָא דַּעֲבַד יְיָ אֱלֹהִים <strong>וַאֲמַר</strong> לְאִתְּתָא בְּקוּשְׁטָא אֲמַר יְיָ לָא תֵּיכְלוּן מִכֹּל אִילָן גִּנְּתָא.</p>\n<p>The serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which Hashem Elohim made; it <strong>said</strong> to the woman, “Did Hashem truly say that you should not eat from all the trees of the Garden?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which would seem to indicate that he agrees with that reading</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.3.1.9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ohr Chaim here</a> says that it wasn't speech such as we have it, but rather a standard hiss of a snake that Chava could understand.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Perhaps you can answer according to the chizkuni that says the snake got wisdom because it ate from the aitz hadaas (since wasn't commanded in not eating from it). So naturally it didn't have the ability to speak like man did.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Based on Chesed LeAvraham 4:5, and my general understanding:</p>\n<p>There are two levels to intellect - the first is Chochma, and the second is Binah. Chochma is much higher, and more subtle, than Binah.</p>\n<p>The Human being is the only creature that was created from Chochma. Animals were created with Binah.</p>\n<p>Understanding the difference between Chochma and Binah should help understand the difference between the speech of humans and the speech of animals.</p>\n<p>The problem is, this is quite hard to explain (we are trying to talk about the things that we <em>use to talk</em>, so that's understandable). I will give two different angles and then summarise and hope that it's a good explanation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I came to answer this question and I didn't know what the answer was. I looked here and there and thought a bit and at some point, I figured out the answer. That happened in a split second - I had the full answer. The only problem is, it's taking me time to type it all out and put it into words, but nonetheless, everything I am writing here was all there in the initial \"aha\" moment, even if I didn't know exactly what words and explanations I would use to answer the question at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this example, the \"aha\" event was a Chochma event. The idea in its pure, \"conceptual\" form entered my intellect. Then, the idea was passed into my Binah,  which took over in putting it into words. In this example, Chochma is almost magical - its the part of our brain whose currency is actual grasping of ideas, and is very lofty. Binah is more like a computer that processes ideas. It's still lofty, but is more akin to something we can mimick with computers, which brings us to the next example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AI language models spend a lot of time reminding us that no, they are not actually a person, and don't actually know anything and it's all an illusion. They are not speaking to us in the way we speak, with actual awareness of what they are saying as they say it. They don't have ideas, or conceive of concepts. They are just very very good at manipulating letters and words using logical processes and computation, so that we find it useful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ChatGPT could change its \"I am not what you think I am\" reminders to be \"I don't have any Chochma, it's an illusion. I have something akin to binah, I process data, but I don't know what I am actually doing\". The magical ingredient of <em>knowing the meaning of the words and phrases I am using</em> is a Chochma skill, and that's unique to humans. Animals have only a very very small, insignificant degree of Chochma, if at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: So, to the commentaries that bring the point that the Nachash's speech was fundamentally different to humans, I think the difference lies here. The Nachash was more like an AI LLM in its speech than a human, if not exactly the same. It could express its desire, and even do so in a clever (or crafty) way, but it was still doing so out of instinct, rather than its own essence. Humans, on the other hand, are literally made out of the stuff of true, knowing speech - Chochma.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that generally, when it comes to sin, people find excuses to justify why their actions are not transgressions - cognitive dissonance.

    "content": "# Why do some people from Nusach Sefard say Shalom Rav only by Mincha - not by Maariv\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Every day, towards the end of שמונה עשרה for שחרית, after ברכת כהנים we say the ברכה of שלום. To be specific, we say שים שלום, regardless of what נוסח you Daven. At מנחה and מעריב - people who Daven נוסח אשכנז say a different version of the ברכה of שלום, שלום רב. Their reasoning is that שים שלום echoes the language of ברכת כהנים and is reserved for תפילות where ברכת כהנים is said (שחרית - מוסף - מנחה לתענית ציבור etc.). Therefore, it would seem inappropriate to recite it at a תפילה where we don't say ברכת כהנים.</p>\n<p>Some examples of how שים שלום echoes the language of ברכת כהנים are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"שים שלום\" - echoes the words \"וישם לך שלום\"</li>\n<li>\"באור פניך\" - echoes the words \"יאר ה' פניו\"</li>\n<li>\"ברכנו אבינו\" - echoes the words \"כה תברכו\" and \"ואני אברכם\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But, there are some נוסח ספרד קהילות who do say שלום רב at מעריב. So, here's my question: if they say שלום רב at מעריב because we only say שים שלום at תפילות where there is ברכת כהנים - then why do these people say שים שלום at מנחה?!? Do they either have an answer to how מנחה is connected to ברכת כהנים, or a different reason why they say שלום רב at מעריב?</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, they are all miracles by which the disposition of natural law is overpowered, except that no change from the natural order of the world is noticeable, as was the case with the miracles done through Mosheh Rabbeinu with the ten plagues, the dividing of the Sea, the Manna, the well, and their like, for these are miracles which openly changed nature, and they were done with the Tetragrammaton which He told to him. It is for this reason that He now told Abraham our father that He is the Almighty, the Victor Who will prevail over his constellation of birth so that he will have a son, and thus there will be a covenant between Him and his seed forever, meaning that the portion of the Eternal is His people,⁠ and that He will lead them at His own will, as they will not be under the rule of a star or constellation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/139929/34188\">What does Ramban refer to with the term \"hidden miracles\"?</a> for more from Ramban in this regard)</p>\n\n\n",

A good indicator of how <em>exactly</em> to break up the passuk is what the trop is/would be.

    "content": "# Was the world really created by the Hebrew letters?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There’s a somewhat-famous Kabbalistic concept, recorded first in the Sefer Yetzirah, that Hashem created the world by using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>\n<p>Assuming Hebrew indeed evolved from an older language, how should this be understood?</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is an extremely esoteric idea within Kabbalah, and I’m not asking for a complete explanation. Nevertheless, I hope it’s possible to explain this one facet—namely, what the Hebrew letters have to do with anything—if Hebrew as we know it didn’t evolve until much later (as per the above assumption).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The concept that Hashem used letters to create the world does not originate in kabbalistic works, but it is mentioned in Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.55a.13?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'rakhos 55a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: Bezalel knew how to join the letters with which heaven and earth were created. From where do we derive this? It is written here in praise of Bezalel: “And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship” (Exodus 31:3); and it is written there with regard to creation of heaven and earth: “The Lord, by wisdom, founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens” (Proverbs 3:19), and it is written: “By His knowledge the depths were broken up and the skies drop down the dew” (Proverbs 3:20). We see that wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, the qualities with which the heavens and earth were created, are all found in Bezalel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, we have to conclude that the ancient languages could have used the same sounds, and the divergence between them occured historically due to merging or slight modification of sounds. This could have occured due to the fact that climate, nutrition and lifestyle in different parts of the world causes people develop differently.

    "content": "# How to push back against people who use the Tanakh to justify and promote antisemitism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It has been argued by atheists and other thinkers, namely self-hating Jew Christopher Hitchens, that the Bible/Tanakh is the biggest contributing factor to antisemitism, and it is not exactly without sense: the Tanakh does, after all, depict Jews in a negative light at many points in time and in numerous instances, is very critical towards Jews. Furthermore, since an atheist doesn't believe in G-d, they view the commandments as being created by the Jews themselves and as they perceive some of the commandments as being primitive or inhumane, they will thus associate these characteristics with those whom they think created these laws. Additionally, Christians, Muslims, Nazis, etc. alike do refer to the Tanakh in order to vilify the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>So, what would be the best course of action to combat antisemites who use the Tanakh to justify and promote antisemitism? I would appreciate it if we could cite rabbinic wisdom in the answers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If the OP's question is about negative words of the prophets - these words were said with big pain and trepidation to seek teshuvah and good deeds of the Jewish people, not to serve as an accusation, as we clearly learn in mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 4:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Zadok said: do not make them (words of Torah) a crown for self-exaltation, nor a spade with which to dig (against others).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the opposite, the claims of anti-semites are not genuine and are always made as means to exalt oneself, acquire leadership, mobilize their people against a convenient enemy, and also rob Jewish people of their possessions. When such people are using Tanakh, the same mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 4:5</a> continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So too Hillel used to say, “And he that puts the crown (of Torah) to his own use shall perish.” Thus you have learned, anyone who derives worldly benefit from the words of the Torah, <strong>removes his life from the world</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Jewish tradition views such people negatively. It is certainly important to point their true intentions. Because of how these people are using the words of Tanakh, they cannot be representing the Jewish people! <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hitchens</a> (1949-2011) was a socialist of the Marx and Trotsky brand of socialism. It is a religion with its dialectic materialist mysticism, very hostile to Jewish people, just as both Marx and Trotsky were.</p>\n\n\n",

Israel itself is in exile and sinning?\" Primarily used to ask this on Isaiah 49:5-6</p>\n<p>But truthfully it is not difficult at all. The answer is indeed that Israel brings back Israel to itself, and here is the thought process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Israel shall never be <strong>totally</strong> demolished/disbanded</p>\n<pre><code>Jeremiah 31:35-37, Isaiah 44:21, 1 Kings 6:11-13\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>The wicked of Israel (and some righteous), are exiled due to <em>collective</em> sin</p>\n<pre><code>Ezekiel 39:23, 2 Kings 17:7-8, Deuteronomy 28:49-68\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>The remainder of Israel are brought back and return to righteousness & realize their survival depends on Torah observance alone</p>\n<pre><code>Ezekiel 36:24-38, Deuteronomy 30:1-10, 1 Kings 8:46-51\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It can be seen that this return to Torah is what leads to the ultimate salvation and restoration of Israel. Now who else would advocate Torah observance? Clearly those who have seen the other side and lived, those who have the knowledge of God and His Torah.</p>\n<p>So yes, the wise and righteous of Israel exhort the remainder to return to Torah. After all, the prophets are righteous Jews who exclaimed to KEEP TORAH... or else.</p>\n<p>Combine this with the popular dictum: All Israel is responsible for each other (Shevuot 39a)</p>\n<p>I hate to add this, but in truth, christians believe jesus himself was a Jewish man. So even if a christian wants to refute this method of thinking, according to their book, a Jew brings salvation to Jews FIRST (Matthew 15:24, Romans 1:16), meaning a Jew from <em><strong>Israel</strong></em> restores... <em><strong>Israel</strong></em>.

    "content": "# Why is it thought that Moses was only a Priest for 7 days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Moses is unique in the Hebrew Bible as the only Priest-King of Israel. There is also, of course, Melchizedek and probably some pagan Priest-Kings of other nations in the bible as well. Something that I've learned since I've started participating on this forum is that one traditional belief is that Moses only temporarily held the position of (High) Priest for 7 days or so whilst he ordained Aaron - at which point he supposedly ceased to be a priest.</p>\n<p>Some here have claimed this transfer of the priesthood to be \"obvious,\" but as one who has read through the scriptures many times and been unaware of this tradition - I do not find it obvious in the least. Moses continued to intercede for the people and for Aaron after Aaron was made the High Priest, he instructed Aaron on how to perform his duties and rebuked him, and it was Moses who went into the Tent of Meeting before God throughout the wilderness - thereby causing his face to glow and thus requiring him to use a veil to cover himself so as to not scare the people. Moses was also declared to be Elohim whilst Aaron was made his prophet. Thus, based upon the scriptures, it seems rather clear that Moses both served as a Priest for much longer than a week - and that he was higher than Aaron even when he became High Priest.</p>\n<p>But I am open to correction and would like to know the reasoning behind the assertion that Moses was only temporarily a priest despite his continued role of interceding for the people - including Aaron? How would you argue this position? And are there competing views on this within Judaism, or is this the de-facto standard belief?</p>\n<p>Thanks :)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>See Zevahim 102a where a number of opinions are quoted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moses was originally meant to be a priest, but the priesthood was taken away from him and given to Aaron;</li>\n<li>Moses was only ever meant to act as a priest during the seven days of inaugurating the Tabernacle;</li>\n<li>Moses remained a priest his whole life, but his children were not priests.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What is a significantly disabled person supposed to do if no Orthodox Jew will marry them?",
    "content": "# What is a significantly disabled person supposed to do if no Orthodox Jew will marry them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'll divide this question into 4 parts:</p>\n<h3>1.</h3>\n<p>If someone has a severe disability but cannot find an orthodox marriage partner, what in halacha are they expected to do regarding forbidden sexual activities? [This is <strong>not</strong> a question about whether they are obligated to have children.] For example, if someone has significant autism (level 2 ASD) and depression but is fully verbal and understand abstract concepts, what are they required to do regarding sexual and intimate needs? For example, are they allowed to be motzei zera levatala?</p>\n<p>Some people assume that such people could not be happily married but such assumptions may be due to issues of stigma that prevent any possibility of Jewish marriage. Yet in reality such a person could be happily married. For example, an Orthodox Jewish social reject might marry a non-Jew because such a person might be willing to consider them as a marriage prospect in a way that religious Jews are not. And    such a marriage might be successful in showing that they are capable of intimacy, and in fact, are a pleasant person to live with.</p>\n<h3>2.</h3>\n<p>Suppose a Jew has autism and a progressive disease like some forms of painful multiple sclerosis which which makes their predicament worse each year. Suppose their deteriorating physical disability, makes them bed bound and unable to attend a Shul. Their pain makes their life very hard on an hour by hour basis. Are there any halachic leniencies regarding non intimate yichud? Does their level of loneliness factor into this? Does this situation allow any sexual activities not permitted in the previous scenario?</p>\n<h3>3.</h3>\n<p>Obviously intermarriage is completely forbidden in halacha.</p>\n<p>Orthodox dating assumes that people are \"currently OK\". However some nonJews may be willing to date someone who is not doing emotionally great at the tine. The process of intimacy can be healing and in time, their emotional state may improve. (Obviously that doesn't mean that a relationship is an emotional cure all and there are many factors in play.)</p>\n<p>We say that the Torah doesn't ask too much of people. People with autism are rejected by much of society, Jewish and non-Jewish. Yet they are expected not to intermarry, despite it being one of the few ways they have positive social interaction in their life. Furthermore, if the only people willing to socialize with them are a small subset of nonJews are they supposed to remain lonely?</p>\n<p>It seems like such Jews are pushed hard in the direction of intermarriage. It seems that the Torah is asking too much. Unless you say that a lifetime of suffering, severe depression, and loneliness is not asking too much.</p>\n<h3>4.</h3>\n<p>Mental health can be hugely impacted by disability and disease. And physical pain too can cause depression. But social rejection is another big cause of negative mental health. If someone is in a situation of psychiatric pikuach nefesh because of all these things, are there sny halachic leniencies regarding sexual and intimate needs? For example a person may be long term suicidal but able to come out of it when they finally experience love from a non-Jew as well as a set of non Jewish friends who accept them for who they are with all the unusual traits of significant autism.</p>\n<p>They may have to choose between their life and their status as an Orthodox Jew. This is not purely fictional as a countable number of formerly Orthodox Jews have been essentially excluded due to severe disability (typically multiple disabilities). Halacha sees suicide as essentially self murder and it is conceivable that it is better to do various typically forbidden practices rather than end one's own life due to foreseeable mental health problems that could be ameliorated.</p>\n<p>NB: I'm asking assuming the scenarios I gave. In theory if we all were mekayem  ואהבת לרעך כמוך properly, many of these issues would be tremendously mitigated. But in the real world, some Jews with autism / developmental disabilities are bullied and excluded. Many are made to feel like they don't belong in klal Yisroel. So they have to take the world as it is, not as it should be. Maybe fixing this may help bring Moshiach.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: this is not about the obligation to procreate which is asked elsewhere. It's about what heterim are available if someone cannot get married because they are unwanted. Even if one is not ready physically or psychologically to have children, one can and should get married according to another answer given. But what if one can't get married? How does a person deal with sexual needs and emotional intimacy meeds etc? And how does one negotiate the social rejection because of severe disability?</p>\n\n\n",

I don't think it applies just to worshipping physical objects (your typical vision of \"idols\" like human-like statues, etc..), but that idols can also be mental or other types of things too? I am also not certain what the definition of <em>worship</em> is.</p>\n<p>But this gets me to think about the Hebrew letters and the 10 Sefirot diagram (after absorbing a good portion of the <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Sefer-Yetzirah-Audiobook/151594543X\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefir Yetzirah book by Aryeh Kaplan</a>).</p>\n<p>In his commentary about the Sefir Yetzirah, he paints vivid pictures of the meaning of the structure of the letters, and how they correlate to this and that. And how engraving and carving the letters into your mind, focusing on them intensely, you can gain deep knowledge about the universe (G-d's creation). The letters are not \"worshipped\", in that I am not treating them I would a person and giving respect to them, and bowing down to them. But I am focusing intensely on the letters and shapes and symbolisms within them (and numerical values, associations, etc..). Focusing on this stuff can absorb your entire consciousness on your way to integrating with the divine, so to speak.</p>\n<p>So is idolatry more of like, bowing down and respecting a symbol as if it were like a person? And it's not like what we are doing with the letters in the Sefir Yetzirah commentary here? Or is this a form of idolatry too? Where is the line drawn exactly?</p>\n<p>Same with the 10 Sefirot diagram. This is how G-d interacts with creation, and you study it, you try and navigate it in your mind, body, and experience, etc.. You do a lot of \"thinking\" about it, but I guess I wouldn't call it \"worship\".</p>\n<p>It seems to become \"worship of idols\", you would have to turn the Hebrew alphabet into something like Tarot cards (which I know mostly nothing about so far). I imagine one who deals with Tarot cards would think think they are possessed of magical powers, and not that they are just emanations of G-d's power. Going down that road, you would forget about G-d and start being passionate and absorbed about the Hebrew alphabet possessing magical powers.</p>\n<p>Is that sort of the line for where \"curiosity\" and \"research\" (thinking and meditating), becomes \"worship\"? I guess I don't understand the meaning of worship clearly.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Idolatry is believing <strong>or</strong> behaving as if anything other than Hashem—an object, concept, idea, symbol, literally anything—is a god, or has power independent of Hashem.</p>\n<p>Focusing on letters has nothing to do with idolatry.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chassidic Minhagim for different hats and bekitches\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am new to this forum and do not really know what help I can get but here is my question. I'm a Chabad chasid and this week including Shabbos I found myself in Kiryas Joel, and I saw many Satmar hasidim. What interested me was that some of them were wearing flat beaver hats, and some of them were wearing taller hats. Can anyone explain the difference in chassidic minhagim for wearing different hats, which are kept by Satmars?</p>\n<p>I also saw a lot of people (what appeared as under bar mitzvah and unmarried) wearing bekitches, which I thought are only for married men. Can anyone explain the chassidic minhagim for wearing bekitches, which are kept by Satmars as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In regards to long coats such as rekels or bekishes in most communities the norm is to start wearing them from the age of bar mitzvah onwards. This is not universal as some will start wearing them even before. As far as I know the standard minhag in satmar is to start from bar mitzvah.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In regards to hats. There is the standard satmar hat which is flatter. Though you will see some variations. After the war certain chassidim groups such as satmar absorbed other chassidim. I think some of the variations are due to individual family customs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In regards to chabad there was chabad levush in Russia and chabad levush as it developed in America. At one point there was no set levush for lubavitchers to wear and just what Jews in the area typically wore. This at times was more similar to what a lot of other chissidic groups today including streimels but not necessarily so. Today there is a distinct chabad levush which largely was created in the United States based on what the Rebbe wore and encouraged.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is based on my own understanding as I don't know of a source or sefer to quote to you about the subject.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do non-Jews follow the solar calendar or the lunar calendar for Halachic purposes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sukkah 29a) says that the nations of the world base their calendar on the sun, as opposed to the Jewish people, who base it on the moon, and the Mechilta De’Rabbi Yishmael says on the verse that teaches about the commandment of sanctifying the moon - ״החודש הזה לכם״ (Shemot 12:2), that we learn it out from the word ״לכם״ - meaning “for us”.</p>\n<p>My question is: does that mean that non-Jews have their birthday based on the solar calendar, with regards to ages of maturity, i.e. ages 9 and 13 for a male; 3 and 12 for a female, or do they follow the lunar calendar in this regard?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Not thinking scripturally, but looking at the non-Jewish world as it is today, the majority of nations have adopted-- at least civilly-- the christian calendar which is based on both in ways. The Christian year is a solar year, eg, how long it takes for the earth to complete one full revolution around the sun, and return to the same place in its orbit, however, it is by lunar divisions of time (one \"lunation\"-- full length of time required for the moon to go through all phases and return back to the same, such as new moon to the next new moon)-- which vary at or around 28 days, that gives the idea of christian months. Lunations are not all the same because the moon's orbit around the earth varies significantly in the length and \"oval-ness\" of its path, in a fixed cycle-- but on average are about 28 days each. Of course, the christian months are further confused through the adoption of the Roman months of July and August, placed into the middle of the year, which are the reason the fall months are incorrect for their English (or, better yet, Latin), prefixes-- (eg, September, Sept- means 7, but it is 9, October, Oct- means 8, etc., all the way down to December with Dec- means 10 but it is 12.). Coupling the addition of the new Roman months with a fixed number of days in each month that are unequal, has, in a way, rendered the months in the Christian calendar completely irrelevant to the moon. Worth noting is, 28 days*13=364, so you could have 13 months and one day, to make up the 365 days of the solar year. Now, none of that would have to do with jewish law, but to the point that \"the nations of the world,\" including completely foreign lands with traditionally other cutlures, such as far east Asia, for example-- all have adopted, at least civilly, the christian calendar...This would be the calendar that, reading the question you asked, concerning today, would be considered. It is based on the sun, but in a way is based on the moon...at least in theory.</p>\n<p>So, measuring everything, including birthdays, and therefore birthdays concerning maturity or culpability, would be based thereon.</p>\n<p>Presenting what is truly a non-answer, it falls to anyone to judge whether the system presently worldwide-adopted is fully solar or fully lunar, it is neither completely and it is both.</p>\n\n\n",

Why was Noah called righteous in his generation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the pasuk of Parshas Noach, what prompted the pasuk to write Noach was righteous in his generation? We don't find the Torah writing about any Avos or Imahos vis-a-vis they're righteous in their generation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Satmar Rav (Divrei Yoel Al HaTorah, Parshas Noach, p. 117) quotes Rav Chaim Vital, and explains that being a tzadik, is not only because of one's deeds, but also the generation in which a person lives has an influence on the righteousness.</p>\n<p>The Abarbanel teaches us that the word (תָּמִ֥ים) tamim - upright - means that Noach had no inclination to do evil. This is, because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noach walked with G-d, which means that he lived amongst evil people but did not follow their ways. He just followed G-d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.108a.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Sanhedrin 108a)</a> famously teaches us that Noach was a tzadik in his generation, but if he lived in the generation of Avraham, he would not be a tzadik per se.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to the verse: “These are the generations of Noah; Noah was a righteous man, and wholehearted in his generations” (Genesis 6:9), Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Relative to the other people of his generation he was righteous and wholehearted, but not relative to those of other generations. And Reish Lakish says: In his generation he was righteous and wholehearted despite being surrounded by bad influences; all the more so would he have been considered righteous and wholehearted in other generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tevas Gome (Noach 4) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations; Noah walked with G-d” (Bereishis 6:9). Since he did not rebuke the people of his generation, nor did he pay attention to their actions at all, he did not mix with them. His entire manner of living was in solitude with G-d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to some, this, e.g. Noach did not try to rebuke people, this is one of his sins (Chasam Sofer Al HaTorah, Parshas Noach).</p>\n<p>Based on the Abarbanel, the reason why the Torah saw the need to mention that Noach was a tzadik in his generations, was to teach us that, in the generations of Noach, the people were corrupt, and most evil. Noach was upright and walked with G-d. However, as Rav Moshe Feinstein (Darash Moshe Al HaTorah, Parshas Noach) teaches: he did walk with G-d, not before G-d, as Avraham Avinu. Noach entered the ark because G-d told him to. With Avraham, all the trials and all what happened, did Avraham out of love for Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

What did He do - He mixed/partnered the two measures, the measure of judgment and the measure of mercy, and created him (man/Adam) as it is said, \"And the Lord G-d created man\" Bereshis 2:7) And so He did to him at the time he (Adam) sinned according to both the measure of judgement and the measure of mercy. The measure of judgement told him that \"<em>on the day you eat from it you will die</em> (Bereshis 2:17)\" and since Adam ate he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>And the measure of mercy?

Eash one (except for Methushelach) died on the same G-d's day (close to 1000 years) as each one was born, and Methushelach saw the beginning of the next due to his righteousness. Finally, the judgement of 120 years (Bereshis 6:3) was defered for the time after the flood and then of 70 years by the times of Moshe and David.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya makes a related note. We do not find mentioning of death in descendats of Shem, like we find among the earlier generations from Adam till Noach. This is because the kingship of David came from Shem, and there is no death for Mashiyach ben David.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Abraham not know who Isaac should marry if G-d told him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the end of Parshat Vayera (22:20), Abraham is informed that his brother Nahor has fathered a number of descendants, including a granddaughter named Rebecca.</p>\n<p>Rashi ad loc (20) explains that these verses were to reassure Abraham that Isaac's spouse had been born, and on the verse \"and Bethuel begot Rebecca\" (23) Rashi makes it clear that the entire genealogical transcription was on account of this verse.</p>\n<p>(Also note that Rebecca is the only female mentioned in the entire passage.)</p>\n<p>With that in mind, why wasn't it obvious to Abraham who Isaac's soulmate was destined to be? why didn't he send Eliezer with explicit instructions?</p>\n<p>Someone suggested to me that the message was conveyed to Abraham via non-divine methods, so it wasn't a prophesied announcement.</p>\n<p>But that sort of begs the question, what was the point of informing Abraham then?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even though one may think that G-d had preordained that Rivka was Yitzchak's soulmate, the choice to marry was in her and Yitzchak's hands. For example, Avraham states so to Eliezer in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 24:8</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if the woman does not consent to follow you, you shall then be clear of this oath to me; but do not take my son back there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THEN SHALT THOU BE CLEAR FROM THIS MY OATH etc. — and take a wife for him from the daughters of Aner or Eshcol or Mamre.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point is also repeated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 24:49</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now, if you mean to treat my master with true kindness, tell me; and if not, tell me also, that I may turn right or left.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TO THE RIGHT HAND — to take a wife of the daughters of Ishmael. TO THE LEFT — to take a wife of the daughters of Lot who dwelt at the left of Abraham (Genesis Rabbah 60:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, due to passing the Akkeida test by Yitzchak, Avraham was told about Rivka as the best available offer for his son Yitzchak. It is implied by the comment of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Genesis.22.23.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno to Bereshis 22:23</a> (Thanks Rabbi Kaii!)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובתואל ילד את רבקה, the person relating all this to Avraham added that Bethuel, a son of Nachor’s proper wife, sired Rivkah. The meaning of the message was that there had been born in his own family a girl who would be a suitable wife for Avraham’s son so that he would not have to look for such a wife among the K'naanites surrounding him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's why Avraham tells Eliezer that Rivka was coming fully from <em>his</em> family, while all other candidates were not. Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre were K'naanim; Yishmael had a mother and a wife from Mitzraim; children of Lot, Ammon and Moav, also took wives from the women of K'naan. Finally, Eliezer's daughter was not from Avraham's family as Eliezer was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31916/the-status-of-eliezer-as-a-slave\">Eved K'naani</a>, originally <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77913/is-eliezer-a-canaanite\">from K'naan</a> (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1495/who-was-eliezers-father\">some other opinions are known too</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In addition to Y DJ's answer, there are a couple more possibilities.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Avraham may have known, but he didn't want to interfere with Hashem's hashgacha, as is implied by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.7?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Malbim</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שכ\"ז נעשה בהשגחתו, הוא ישלח מלאכו שליח ההשגחה שהיא תבא אל יצחק</p>\n<p>Since all of this was done under His providence, He will send His\nangel, the agent of divine oversight, to find a wife for Isaac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Speculation: It could be that Avraham was trying to show how important it is to rely on Hashem completely and totally, and giving Eliezer too much information would prevent that. It could also be that this is support for the concept that a soul mate is not necessarily fixed and can change based on deeds etc.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>He did hint that it should be Rivka to Eliezer, according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.4?lang=he&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואל מולדתי, העיר שנולדתי והיא אור כשדים; ר\"ל כי שם ימצא משפחתו, ועל\nרבקה רמז לו כי הוגד לו שנולדה. ובב\"ר א\"ר יצחק. כי אל ארצי היינו דאמרי\nאינשי חטין דקרתך זונין מנהון זרע:</p>\n<p>ואל מולדתי, the town in which I was born, i.e. Ur Kasdim. Avraham\nmeant to say that there Eliezer would find his family; he hinted at\nRivkah, seeing that he had been informed of her birth. According to\nRabbi Yitzchok in Bereshit Rabbah 59,8 the words “to my land” reflect\na well known proverb according to which people prefer to plant seed\noriginating in their own backyard even though the strain is known to\nbe inferior to those available elsewhere [R Eli Munk translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Speculation: It could be that Avraham wanted to show how loyal and trustworthy Eliezer was, so he only gave him a hint.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In most midrashim it says hashem told him that his zivug was born but Hashem didnt tell him who it was. It could rashi also means this, hes just saying to us who it was, but not that hashem told Avraham the name.</p>\n\n\n",

To the king who increases the authority of the Holy One, blessed be He, upon himself, to fear Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>authority.</strong> an expression of government. [This is to refute those who disagree with us [the Christians]. But it is possible to say that “Prince of Peace,” too, is one of the names of the Holy One, blessed be He, and this calling of a name is not actually a name but an expression of (var. for the purpose of) greatness and authority. Comp. (Ruth 4:11) “And be famous (וּקְרָא שֵׁם) in Bethlehem. Also (II Sam. 7:9, I Chron. 17:8): ” And I shall make for you a name.“ Here too, Scripture means, ” And He gave him a name and authority.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>and for peace.</strong> which is given to him, there will be no end, for he had peace on all his sides, and this “end” is not an expression of an end to eternity, but there will be no boundaries. On the throne of the kingdom of David shall this peace be justice and righteousness that Hezekiah performed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>and for peace.</strong> Heb. <strong>וּלְשָׁלוֹם.</strong> This ‘vav’ is to rectify the word, thus: He [Hezekiah] increased the authority upon his shoulder, and what reward will He [G-d] pay him? Behold, his peace shall have no end or any limit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>from now and to eternity.</strong> The eternity of Hezekiah, viz. all his days. And so we find that Hannah said concerning Samuel (I Sam. 1:22): “and abide there forever.” And, in order to refute those who disagree [i.e., the Christians, who claim that this (Prince of Peace) is their deity], we can refute them [by asking], What is the meaning of: “from now” ? Is it not so that the “deity” did not come until after five hundred years and more?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>the zeal of the L-rd of Hosts.</strong> Who was zealous for Zion concerning what Aram and Pekah planned about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>shall accomplish this.</strong> but Ahaz does not deserve it, moreover, the merit of the Patriarchs has terminated. [Addendum: And our Rabbis said: The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to make Hezekiah the Messiah and Sennacherib, Gog and Magog. Said the ministering angels before the Holy One, blessed be He, Should the one who stripped the doors of the Temple and sent them to the king of Assyria, be made Messiah?

Therefore maybe the same applies for לשם שמים, as however you interpret what it means, the simple meaning is your doing it for \"shamyim's\" sake which is Hashem, but we don't say \"Leshem Hashem\" because of the fear and distance that we also have with Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the sources I bring below, my initial assumption was that this is shorthand for <strong>The One Who dwells in shamayim</strong> in the manner of <strong>השוכן בשמים</strong>. Where for shamayim itself, there's the notion of the heavens of the physical universe and also the notion of the metaphysical shamayim. But there are also possibilities that even as early as Tanach, <strong>sometimes שמים can be a direct reference to הקב\"ה</strong>.</p>\n<p>Your example of <strong>לשם שמים</strong> in אבות ב:ב is one of many examples of חז\"ל using the term <strong>shamayim</strong> to refer to G_d directly or to G_d in Heaven.  Here is a list of cases I could find in the Mishna alone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>שם שמים</strong> - סנהדרין ו:ד, אבות א:יא, ב:ב,יב, ד:ד,יא, ה:יז</li>\n<li><strong>מלכות שמים</strong> - ברכות ב:ב,ה</li>\n<li><strong>אביו\\אביכם\\אביהם\\אבינו\\אביך שבשמים</strong> - כלאים ט:ח, יומא ח:ט, ר\"ה ג:ח, סוטה ט:טו, אבות ה:כ</li>\n<li>(<strong>קידשוהו שמים?</strong> - ר\"ה ב:ז)</li>\n<li><strong>בידי שמים</strong> - יבמות ד:יג, סנהדרין ט:ו, יא:ה, חולין ג:ב, נגעים יא:ג</li>\n<li><strong>של שמים</strong> - נדרים ב:ד</li>\n<li><strong>נפש\\גוף לשמים</strong> - נדרים ד:ג</li>\n<li><strong>מקדש לשמים</strong> - נדרים ה:ו</li>\n<li><strong>מן השמים</strong> - נדרים י:ו, סנהדרין ב:א, י:א</li>\n<li><strong>דיני שמים</strong> - ב\"ק ו:ד</li>\n<li><strong>אלוקינו שבשמים</strong> - סנהדרין ז:י</li>\n<li><strong>מורה שמים</strong> - אבות א:ג, ד:יב</li>\n<li><strong>דעתו לשמים</strong> - מנחות יג:יא</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also of course have the well-known phrase <strong>בסיעתא דשמיא</strong> (<em>with Heaven's help</em>) which is a request for G_d's assistance.</p>\n<p>When one examines the many usages of the word שמים in Tanach, one can see that <strong>the terminology of חז\"ל didn't emerge from a vacuum</strong> and quite possibly is used in a similar way at a much earlier time to a lesser degree. Here are some of the most relevant examples <strong>from the Chumash</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>(שמות כ:יח) וַיֹּאמֶר ה' אֶל מֹשֶׁה כֹּה תֹאמַר אֶל בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אַתֶּם רְאִיתֶם כִּי <strong>מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> דִּבַּרְתִּי עִמָּכֶם</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(דברים כו:טו) הַשְׁקִיפָה <strong>מִמְּעוֹן קׇדְשְׁךָ מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> וּבָרֵךְ אֶת עַמְּךָ אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל <strong>וְאֵת הָאֲדָמָה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה לָנוּ</strong> כַּאֲשֶׁר נִשְׁבַּעְתָּ לַאֲבֹתֵינוּ אֶרֶץ זָבַת חָלָב וּדְבָשׁ</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(דברים לב:מ) כִּי אֶשָּׂא אֶל <strong>שָׁמַיִם</strong> יָדִי וְאָמַרְתִּי חַי אָנֹכִי לְעֹלָם</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where the first two indicate שמים being <strong>the place of G_d's abode</strong> (<em>true that He is everywhere and owns all but the earth might be considered a domain that's shared with humans - see later \"הַשָּׁמַיִם שָׁמַיִם לַה' והארץ נתן לבני אדם\"</em>) and in the final one we might have a more direct reference to G_d.</p>\n<p><strong>According to Rashi</strong> on Devarim 32:40 (<em>mentioned above</em>) near the end of shiras Haazinu, just as a human swears in the name of G_d, G_d Himself can swear by His own name:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשא ידי <strong>אל עצמי</strong> בשבועה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another very important section that contributes to this idea is <strong>the tefila that Shlomo Hamelech offers</strong> at the time of the inauguration of the בית המקדש in <strong>מלכים א, פרק ח</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּעֲמֹד שְׁלֹמֹה.....וַיִּפְרֹשׂ כַּפָּיו <strong>הַשָּׁמָיִם</strong>\n.....הִנֵּה <strong>הַשָּׁמַיִם וּשְׁמֵי הַשָּׁמַיִם לֹא יְכַלְכְּלוּךָ</strong> אַף כִּי הַבַּיִת הַזֶּה אֲשֶׁר בָּנִיתִי\n..... וְאַתָּה תִּשְׁמַע <strong>אֶל מְקוֹם שִׁבְתְּךָ אֶל הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> וְשָׁמַעְתָּ וְסָלָחְתָּ\nוְאַתָּה <strong>תִּשְׁמַע הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> וְעָשִׂיתָ וְשָׁפַטְתָּ אֶת עֲבָדֶיךָ.....\nוְאַתָּה <strong>תִּשְׁמַע הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> וְסָלַחְתָּ לְחַטַּאת עַמְּךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל.....\nוְאַתָּה <strong>תִּשְׁמַע הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> וְסָלַחְתָּ לְחַטַּאת עֲבָדֶיךָ וְעַמְּךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל.....\nוְאַתָּה <strong>תִּשְׁמַע הַשָּׁמַיִם מְכוֹן שִׁבְתֶּךָ</strong> וְסָלַחְתָּ וְעָשִׂיתָ.....\nאַתָּה <strong>תִּשְׁמַע הַשָּׁמַיִם מְכוֹן שִׁבְתֶּךָ</strong> וְעָשִׂיתָ כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יִקְרָא אֵלֶיךָ.....\n<strong>וְשָׁמַעְתָּ הַשָּׁמַיִם</strong> אֶת תְּפִלָּתָם וְאֶת תְּחִנָּתָם וְעָשִׂיתָ מִשְׁפָּטָם\n<strong>וְשָׁמַעְתָּ הַשָּׁמַיִם מְכוֹן שִׁבְתְּךָ</strong> אֶת תְּפִלָּתָם וְאֶת תְּחִנָּתָם וְעָשִׂיתָ מִשְׁפָּטָם\nוַיְהִי כְּכַלּוֹת שְׁלֹמֹה לְהִתְפַּלֵּל אֶל ה'.....קָם מִלִּפְנֵי מִזְבַּח ה' מִכְּרֹעַ עַל בִּרְכָּיו וְכַפָּיו פְּרֻשׂוֹת <strong>הַשָּׁמָיִם</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In multiple times here it stresses shamayim as G_d's place and in certain cases such as <strong>תשמע השמים</strong> one might make that case that this even referring to G_d Himself.</p>\n<p>The <strong>(<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ספר הבהיר</a> (סימן ק</strong> brings this idea out from tefilas Shlomo with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מנלן דשמים הקדוש ברוך הוא</strong>?

The Gemara elaborates: A river, as it is written: “I will extend peace to her like a river” (Isaiah 66:12); a bird, as it is written: “As birds hovering, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem” (Isaiah 31:5); and a pot, as it is written: “Lord, You will establish [tishpot] peace for us” (Isaiah 26:12). <em>Peace is likened to a pot which is placed [shafat] on the fire.</em> And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We learned that a pot in a dream is a sign of peace with regard to a pot that does not have meat in it, as a pot that has meat in it symbolizes calamity, as it is stated: “Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron” (Micah 3:3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. L'shem Shamayim - for the sake of name that keeps everything in balance. It is also a marker of the straight path, which avoids steering to the left (judgement) or to the right (mercy).</p>\n\n\n",

As the Gur Aryeh explains (on the Rashi quoted in my question):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>רעים בגופם וכו'</strong> והתרגום תרגם איפכא. ובפרק חלק (סנהדרין קט.) איכא ברייתא כדברי המתרגם ורב יודא כדברי רש\"י. ויראה לי דטעם הברייתא דיותר יש לקרות 'רע' מי שהוא חוטא בממון, כדכתיב \"ורעה עיניך וגו'\", ודבר זה מורה שיש בו רע עין, מאחר שאינו עושה טוב לאחר. ולדעת רב יודא 'רעים בגופם' לפי ש'רע' הוא יותר מן 'חטא', לפי שהוא רע לגמרי, ולפיכך יש לומר 'רעים בגופם' והוא יותר רע ממי שחוטא בממון, שזה נקרא 'חוטא'. ותפס רש\"י דברי רב יודא, כי יותר לפי פשוטו שנקרא 'רע' מי שגופו רע.</p>\n<p><strong>Wicked in their persons etc.</strong> Yet Onkelos translated the opposite. In chapter Chelek (Sanhedrin 109a) there is a b'raisa like Onkelos' version, and Rav Yehuda like Rashi's. And it seems to me that the reasoning of the b'raisa is that it is more accurate to call 'evil' one who sins monetarily, because the passuk states \"and your eye is evil (towards your poor brother, and you don't give him charity)\", and this shows that this man has an evil eye, because he doesn't do good to others. And Rav Yehuda holds that it means 'evil with their bodies' because 'evil' is worse than 'sinner', because he is completely bad, therefore it makes more sense to say 'evil with their bodies' which is worse than sinning monetarily, which is therefore only called 'a sinner'. And Rashi chose to go according to Rav Yehuda, because it follows the p'shat explanation that one whose body is evil, is evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Nevertheless, the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">etymology of the city name Damascus</a>, דר משק, means a plentifully watered place. Could one suppose by analogy that Dammesek refers to Eliezer's primary responsibility to provide water for Avraham's household? Is there a source for it? Is there a connection between בֶן־מֶ֣שֶׁק / manager and Aramaic דַּמֶּ֥שֶׂק with שׂ replacing שׁ due to Eliezer's pronunciation?</p>\n<p>If so, it could explain why Avraham was not afraid to send Eliezer with many camels carrying gifts, as Eliezer was highly skilled at finding wells in unfamiliar places, such as Aram Naharaim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.28b.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma (28b)</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֱלִיעֶזֶר עֶבֶד אַבְרָהָם, זָקֵן וְיוֹשֵׁב בִּישִׁיבָה הָיָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיֹּאמֶר אַבְרָהָם אֶל עַבְדּוֹ זְקַן בֵּיתוֹ הַמֹּשֵׁל בְּכׇל אֲשֶׁר לוֹ״, אָמַר רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר: שֶׁמּוֹשֵׁל בְּתוֹרַת רַבּוֹ. ״הוּא דַּמֶּשֶׂק אֱלִיעֶזֶר״ — אָמַר רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר: שֶׁדּוֹלֶה וּמַשְׁקֶה מִתּוֹרָתוֹ שֶׁל רַבּוֹ לַאֲחֵרִים.</p>\n<p>Eliezer, servant of Abraham, was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who ruled over all he had” (Genesis 24:2). Rabbi Elazar said: The verse means that he had mastery over the Torah of his master, having gained proficiency in all of the Torah of Abraham. That is the meaning of the verse: “He is Damascus [Dammesek] Eliezer” (Genesis 15:2). Rabbi Elazar said: The word Dammesek is a contraction of he who draws [doleh] and gives drink [mashke] to others from his master’s Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, it is reasonable to suggest that Avraham is using Eliezer’s birthplace (regardless of its original etymology) as a play-on-words referencing his talent. Similarly, the rather unusual phrase Avraham uses for “the one in charge of my household” (בן משק ביתי) can be interpreted in the same vein.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Bereishis (14:15), while describing Avraham's fight against the four kings, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויחלק עליהם לילה הוא ועבדיו ויכם וירדפם עד חובה אשר משמאל לדמשק</p>\n<p>At night, he and his servants deployed against them and defeated them; and he pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ha'emek Davar explains this passuk based on the midrash that Avraham's 'servants' is actually just referring to Eliezer, and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וירדפם עד חובה וכו'</strong> החיל שלא הוכו ונזדרזו לברוח. רדפו עליהם אנשי אברם גם לחו\"ל עד חובה. [ולפרש\"י דחובה הוא דן אינו מובן הפי' אשר לשמאל לדמשק]. ומש\"ה נקרא דמשק אליעזר. משום דעד דן היה נקרא המלחמה על אברם. ומדן והלאה נקראת ע\"ש אליעזר. ודמשק היא העיר הראשית.</p>\n<p><strong>And he chased them until Chobah</strong> The soldiers that weren't killed, and hurried and ran away, Avraham's people chased them, even outside of Israel, until Chobah. [And according to Rashi's explanation, that Chobah is Dan, \"North of Damascus\" didn't make sense]. <strong>And this is why his name is Eliezer Damascus, because until Dan the battle was named for Avraham.

So while Avraham was fighting, the battle of named for him. Beyond that, it's named for Eliezer.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there any Torah term or phrase that refers to the ethical act of \"Putting Others First\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To be <strong>mevatter</strong> means to give way, yield, concede, forgo, or waive.  It is related to the root יתר, which means to leave over, and to the word יותר (more).  An examplar in the Torah of this behavior is Rachel Imenu.  Yaakov agreed to work for Lavan to marry his daughter Rachel, but Lavan gave him her sister Leah instead.  The Torah says that the next morning Yaakov realized it was Leah.  Rashi says Yaakov hadn't realized the previous night because he had given signs to Rachel but when she saw they were giving him Leah she was afraid her sister would be embarrassed, so she gave those signs to Leah.  (Rachel was rewarded for this; cf. Rashi/Radak on Jeremiah 31:15.) Although I feel this is an example of being mevatter, I didn’t see that word actually used there.  The word mevatter can also be used in a negative context, as in Mishna Sanhedrin 11:5 “one who disregards (the words of a prophet).”</p>\n\n\n",

The majority of the community subscribes and practices the pre-Talmudic Jewish <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymanot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haymanot</a>.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, why don't the Beta Israel accept the Talmud?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My understanding is that most of the Beta Israel that immigrated to Israel underwent גיור לחומרא - conversion of stringency (see Jews in Israel: Contemporary Social and Cultural Patterns, p. 131 regarding some of the controversy surrounding it). Any Orthodox conversion requires that a candidate of conversion accept the authority of rabbinic Judaism (Bekhoroth 30b, H. Issurei Biah 14:8), which in turn means acceptance of the Talmud.</p>\n<p>The statement attributed to the anonymous Hakham makes it sound like the Beta-Israel actively reject the Talmud. I am unaware of any member of their community that vocally expresses such a perspective.</p>\n<p>Just like may other 'olim from around the world, the Beta-Israel face pressure to assimilate to Israeli culture. This particular pressure may be more acutely felt by members of the Beta-Israel due to racial differences (see Ethiopian Jews in Israel: A Part of the People or Apart From the People? Steven Kaplan, Hagar Salamon). Given that Israeli-culture is generically secular leaning, this may culminate in lax observance of halakhah. This is not necessarily a conscious and active rejection of halakhah but rather simply a sliding into what is \"comfortable\" given the societal pressures.</p>\n<p>Place this tendency in conjunction with the fact that this community has had its own traditions for at least a few hundred years (see The Beta Israel Falasha in Ethiopia: From Earliest Times to the Twentieth Century, ch. 3), it is natural that if/when there is a religious impulse by such individuals it would be expressed in their ancestral way (alongside any other widely practiced Jewish observances that are a part of generic Israeli culture).</p>\n<p>To outward appearance, one might crudely claim that the Beta-Israel \"don't accept the Talmud\" however interpreted to mean an overt rejection of Talmud this is simply not so. As evidence of acceptance of the authority of the Talmud one can also readily point to counter-examples of Beta-Israel that are fully halakhically observant, and those that are furthermore enthusiastic members of the rabbinate itself (Rabbi Reuben Wabashat, Rabbi Sharon Shalom, etc.).</p>\n<p>If it is the Hakham's claim that their community (or even select members) actively rejects the Talmud (as opposed to your characterization in the comments of \"individuals [who] will do what they will just as large swathes of 'Rabbinical Jews' are not orthopraxic\") that is something that would require substantiation. Otherwise it is no more than a broad slur against a community that already struggles.</p>\n\n\n",

This seems unnecessary given that that’s banned in general.  Cross-dressing is also explicitly allowed on Purim.  But how then can the second part of the verse be true (<em>For everyone doing these things is an abomination to the LORD your God</em>)?

There can be situations when no other dress is available for a man to cover himself and one has to do it out of modesty. Alternatively, during the cossack attacks some Jews used female dress to conceal themselves and save their lives. Certainly, the Torah does not forbid such actions as one has to choose life as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 30:19</a>.

This is an application of Rule 4 of the 13 principles of Rabbi Yishmael.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, as Fred points in the comment, the word כי used in the verse, should not be translated as for/because, due to obvious problems which were noted at the beginning.

And in this case I see kaf becoming quf as a sort of \"corruption\" which is compounded by the initial ayin to make Amalek, the word, to me, seem to be essentially a corrupted, twisted version of Melech.</p>\n<p>As a modern analogy in case I'm making no sense, considering Amalek to be the nemesis of Israel, I see a situation very similar to Luigi and Waluigi. Or if you imagine a Mr. Kushnir and his evil nemesis Mr. Qoshner.</p>\n<p>How does this reasoning compare to other styles of reasoning? Is it okay to read into Amalek in this way? Are there any serious flaws with my thought process? Are there sages who have written on the etymology of this name in a way that concretely answers the question?</p>\n<p>As a related question, is there any significance in ayin that I'm not aware of?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The midrashim point to it being a contraction of two words \"עם לק\" lit. \"a people who lick (blood)\".</p>\n<p>For example, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.938.33?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9C%D7%A7&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni 983</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר אחר עמלק עם לק שבא ללוק דמן של ישראל ככלב</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Amalek is (derived from an amalgam of \"עם לק\") a people that lick i.e. that come to lick from the blood of Israel like a dog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Famously, from a gematriah (numerical) perspective, the Hebrew word \"עמלק\" equates to the Hebrew word \"ספק\" - \"doubt\" as they help to sow the seeds of confusion and discord.</p>\n<p>Also refer to @Fred's answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/66193/22152\">here</a> who sources from Rav Schneur Zalman of Liadi who...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>breaks the name of the nation into component words \"עם מלק\" (\"'am malak\") meaning \"severed nation\" in that the nation's metaphysical brain and heart are severed at the neck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The interpretation עם מלק can also refer to the death of Eisav (separation of intellect and emotion), when Hushim ben Dan hit his head and it separated from Eisav's body. It is a reference to the process of <em>melikah</em> when a kohen separates a head of a bird with his nail during a sacrifice (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.1.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 1:15</a>). One can use this idea to explain why G-d make Yaakov's neck strong like marble when Eisav sought to bite his neck.</p>\n<p>I also heard, in the name of R. Gedalia Schorr, that Amaleq can also be read עמל קוף - monkey labor, i.e. the nation that does not produce anything, imitates labor activity, and lives off stealing and preying on its neighbors. (For example, all types of socialist regimes need periodic wars because their economy is not efficient enough to sustain).</p>\n\n\n",

I understand that the ethical  commandments could have been derived by logical thinking, and also from the Noahide laws that had already been given before the patriarchs.  But how could the patriarchs possibly have derived the ritual commandments?  The Midrash says that Lot even observed Pessah, long before the Exodus [Genesis Rabbah 48:12]!  How could they be prescient of Purim, Hanukkah, Pessah, etc., and in particular their specific dates?  Or shaatnez, Shema, tzitzit, tefillin, taharat hamishpacha, etc.?  Any commentaries on this question?</p>\n<p>Some say that the ritual commandments were revealed to Abraham supernaturally. Let me add then: What is the benefit in him observing them, thereby revealing to all those around him (through the holidays) what the future will be?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>¹Sources:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עֵ֕קֶב אֲשֶׁר־שָׁמַ֥ע אַבְרָהָ֖ם בְּקֹלִ֑י וַיִּשְׁמֹר֙ מִשְׁמַרְתִּ֔י מִצְוֺתַ֖י חֻקּוֹתַ֥י וְתוֹרֹתָֽי׃<br />\nBecause Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

The common answer is that Avraham could sense the mitzvot from the very sensitivity his great and lofty soul had towards spirituality. His \"kidneys\" counselled him to order to figure out all of the mitzvot. There is that famous Rashi about how Avraham kept Pesach etc.</p>\n<p>This is explained in the Zohar to mean that the Jewish soul has 613 \"limbs\", each corresponding to a Mitzva. Avraham could sense this through his sensitivity and emunah. This even applied to \"chukim\" and ritualistic commandments, even edut; mitzvot that pertain to an event that hadn't even happened yet, like Pesach.</p>\n<p><sup>Sources so far: Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 26 with Radal (who also brings Nedarim 32a), cf. Sefer HaYashar 24.

Please see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/145813/31534\">Dov's answer</a> for more sources for my points, as well as another, important way that Avraham learned about the mitzvot</sup></p>\n<p>As for what is the benefit, I am not sure the question is particularly compelling because it has an obvious answer: for the reward. Otherwise, for more nuance, one could look into the status of Avraham as a Jew - many hold, such as Parashat Derachim, that he became a fully fledged Jew the moment he dedicated himself to serving Hashem at which point he became <em>obligated</em> in the mitzvot.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_David%2C_Lech_Lecha?vhe=Rosh_David,_Mantova_1776&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Rosh David</a> (by the Chida), which brings lots of opinions, in his discussion on why Avraham waited until age 99 to perform the Brit Milah. It even brings an opinion that he was a \"partially obligated Jew\", and therefore had to avoid the <em>aveirot</em>, but wasn't obligated in the positive mitzvot, which he either did voluntarily (for the reward, the <em>tikkun</em>, etc), or waited until he was commanded (such as the Brit Milah).</p>\n<p>As for \"revealing the future\", that would make it's own (great imo) question.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I recommend trying to get hold of the work \"Avraham Avinu\", the Elzas Edition by R Chaim Zvi Noyek, which like the \"Let my nation\" series, works through all the midrashim and tells the story of Avraham, and it contains extensive footnotes and appendices.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are several sources about this.</p>\n<p>Like @Rabbi_Kaii mentioned about the kidneys, note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_DeRabbi_Natan.33.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos DeRabbi Nosson 33:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא היה אחד מהם שיהלך בדרכי הקב״ה עד שבא אברהם אבינו והלך בדרכי הקב״ה שנא׳ (בראשית כ״ו:ה׳) עקב אשר שמע אברהם בקולי וגו' (וכי תורה אחת שמר והלא תורות הרבה שמר) אלא מלמד שזימן הקב״ה לאברהם אבינו ב׳ כליותיו כשני חכמים והיו מבינות אותו ויועצות אותו ומלמדות אותו חכמה כל הלילה שנא׳ (תהילים ט״ז:ז׳) אברך את ה׳ אשר יעצני אף לילות יסרוני כליותי</p>\n<p>and there was not one among them who walked in the ways of the Holy Blessed One until Abraham our forefather came along, and he walked in the ways of the Holy Blessed One, as it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.26.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 26:5</a>), “Because Abraham heeded My call [and kept My charge, My commandments, My rules, and My Torahs.]” (But there is only one Torah! How could he have kept Torahs, plural?) This teaches that the Holy Blessed One planted two inner voices (lit. kidneys) in Abraham, like two wise men, who helped him understand, advised him, and taught him wisdom all night long, as it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.16.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 16:7</a>), “I will bless the Eternal who has advised me. Even at night, the voices inside of me [lit., my kidneys] have admonished me.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As also has been mentioned, Avraham maintained a relationship with Malkitzedek/Shem where he learnt Torah. Refer to the posuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.18?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 14:18</a> where one view in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.43.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 43:6</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְרַבָּנָן אָמְרֵי תּוֹרָה גִּלָּה לוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (משלי ט, ה): לְכוּ לַחֲמוּ בְלַחְמִי וּשְׁתוּ בְּיַיִן מָסָכְתִּי</p>\n<p>The Rabbis say: He revealed Torah [precepts] to him, as it is stated: “Come, partake of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mixed” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.9.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 9:5</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the heart of it was his relationship with Hashem. All the avos spoke exclusively with Hashem (refer to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38103&st=&pgnum=154&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaGadol 17:22</a> which notes that when G-d spoke to them he did so exclusively without the Chayos or Merkavah etc.). Indeed note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesikta_DeRav_Kahana.5.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta DeRav Kahana 5</a> which writes that Hashem showed Avraham four things - one of which was Torah (the other three being Korbanos, Gehennom and the Four Kingdoms - Bavel, Paras, Yavan and Edom).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Extending the answer of Rabbi Kaii, we know that Shem was Melchizedek of Salem the <strong>priest</strong> of G-d most high (Bereshis 14:18). We also have <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.46.5?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 46:5</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yishmael says: Abraham was a <strong>High Priest</strong>, as it is stated: “The Lord has taken an oath and will not renounce it: You are a priest forever…” (Psalms 110:4), and it is stated elsewhere: “You shall circumcise the flesh of your orla” (Genesis 17:11). [Abraham wondered,] from where should he become circumcised? If he would become circumcised from the ear, he would be unfit to perform sacrifices; if from the mouth, he would be unfit to perform sacrifices; if from the heart, he would be unfit to perform sacrifices. From where could he become circumcised and still be fit to sacrifice? You must say, it is the orla of the body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, one has to conclude that Avraham either learned the ritual law from Noach, Shem, and Ever or / and it was revealed to him as a covenant of Bris Millah.</p>\n<p>There is a dual purpose of the ritual law. It was a vehicle to \"get closer\" to Hashem, i.e. to develop attachment, <em>deveikus</em>. At the time of Abraham all religions were based on active practice of ritual laws, which had strong symbolism and certainly Judaism also had to have such a vehicle to attract a following in opposition to Egypt, Bavel, K'naan, which all had developed religions with epic texts detailing rituals. Additionally, the ritual law can be used as means of <em>kapparah</em> to erase the aftereffect of sins that one could have done.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How is it possible that man can sometimes dissuade HaShem if HaShem's will cannot be changed and He knows best?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For example, G-d wanted to annihilate the Israelites in ch. 32 of Shemot and yet, Moshe was able to change G-d's mind. This happens again Bamidbar 14. Yet, we see in Bamidbar 23 that G-d is not a man that He changes His mind, and it is often affirmed in Judaism that G-d always knows and does what's best. If that's the case, how can He be at times dissuaded, by a human being, no less?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The idea that Hashem does not change is very misunderstood. Rocks never change, statues never change. Of course this does not apply to Hashem, <em>chas veshalom</em>. Pretty much the main message of the Torah is that He is not a statue!</p>\n<p>What it actually means is that He is perfect in every form of perfection, and cannot improve. He cannot become more patient, more just, more kind, more wise, more knowledgable etc. He is already the most patient, just, kind, wise and knowledgable possible - perfect in all forms of perfection!</p>\n<p>So, if we ask His opinion on any matter, His opinion is also perfect, and will never change*! If He did change His opinion, that means His original opinion was not perfect. There was some flaw in His wisdom, His knowledge, His kindness etc, and it was pointed out, so He rectified it, and reanalysed and came up with a new opinion as a result, <em>chas veshalom</em>. So no, His opinions are perfect, and can never change.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if we see Him have a new opinion on the same matter, the only possibility is that it's not actually the same matter. The matter has changed, and hence we are now hearing His opinion on this <em>new</em> matter.</p>\n<p>For example, Hashem says \"<em>salachti kidvarecha</em>\" i.e. \"I forgive you, <em>because of your words</em>\", by the sin of the spies (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 14:20</a>). What changed? Moshe apologised, prayed, and thus the situation itself changed. Hashem's opinion didn't change about the same situation, but now that the situation changed, Hashem revealed a new opinion. When it comes to \"sins of spies\", if nobody apologises, Hashem's opinion is that they should be destroyed. If someone does apologise, His opinion is to spread the anger over many generations and <em>galuyot</em>, ultimately not destroying all but preserving a remnant - see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.17?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachaye on ibid 17</a>**. This is also true of the incident with Moshe and the <em>Chet HaEgel</em>; see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.10?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.10?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.10?lang=bi&with=Commentary%20ConnectionsList&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 32:10</a>. Ramban reads עתה הניחה לי ויחר־אפי בהם ואכלם \"leave me and I will pour my anger on them and destroy them\" as \"if you leave me and do not pray, then I will, but through your prayer, [which will change the situation] I will 'repent' and not destroy them\".</p>\n<p>This is really not too hard to understand. When my child does something very insolent, it makes me angry and feel he deserves to be punished, because I feel like he doesn't understand how wrong it is. However, if he apologises, he surprises me - turns out he did know how wrong it was. Suddenly I don't want to punish him anymore, in fact I want to reward him. Did I change my mind? No, I still agree that punishing him would have been right, <em>if he didn't know what was wrong with what he did</em>. It's just that I don't believe that anymore, because turns out it was never true. I \"changed my mind\", but I really didn't. The <em>situation</em> was different.</p>\n<p>The truth is, humans do change their mind, because we are fallible. We can gain wisdom and knowledge, and lose it, and therefore make mistakes (like I did with my kid, above). We can be patient one day, and not the next. Our kindness goes up and down, as does our justice. If we are in the wrong mood, we punish, if we are in the right mood, we forgive. The lesson here is that this is not true of Hashem. He is always true, always patient, always perfectly kind and just. He can't gain knowledge or wisdom, nor lose it. Therefore His opinions are also all perfect, and do not change on a whim or a mood. <strong>If we see Hashem change His mind, look closer - He didn't, the situation changed.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are tons of sources on this from all angles; Chakira (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaIkkarim%2C_Maamar_4.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkkarim 4:18</a>), Kabbalah (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nefesh_HaChayim%2C_Gate_II.11.1?lang=he&with=Navigation&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nefesh Hachaim 2:11</a>), Chassidus (see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4094528/jewish/Mitzvas-Haamanas-Elokus-Section-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha Ha'amanut Elokut 5-6</a>***) and Mussar (see Michtav Me'Eliyahu, Volume IV, pages 79–81).

Rather, he figure out some other “less painful” way to forgive us.</p>\n<p>So it’s clear that we can affect the method he uses to carry out his plans. However, I don’t think the Torah insinuates anywhere that we have the ability to change his ULTIMATE plans (for indeed they are good and perfect. Why would we want to?).</p>\n<p>Hashem created the world with rules that even he abides by. Sometimes those rules allow us room to squirm in to his schemes, and sometimes it’s those very rules that make his actions solidified and unchangeable.</p>\n\n\n",

He was notorious for so many things back in high school and some time after graduation, he came out as a bisexual and fell out with his high school friends as a result.</p>\n<p>I reached out to him and talked with him about Judaism, particulalry his observance (or lack thereof.) Then he revealed to me that he is actually Messianic. He still considers himself a \"Jew\" even though he is not devout (to his faith). I confronted him that he should stop calling himself a Jew because he objectively is not one but he unfortunately persists.</p>\n<p>The worst part about this is that I can only imagine the negative perceptions he may have conjured or even reinforced about Jews among those who are under the impression that he is a Jew and also know of his notoriety. I tried mitigating this by talking to some of his former pals back in high school, explaining to them that he is not a Jew, but a messianic. Unfortunately, they, perhaps out of antisemitism, seem to persist in regarding him as a Jew.</p>\n<p>How does one deal with a situation like this, where a gentile falsely claims to be a Jew and gives Jews a bad name as a result of his terrible behavior?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Okay, so this is definitely a Christian who is not halakhically Jewish, but they think they are a Jew.

That way there is no embarrassment on their part when you correct them.  Then very tactfully and in a kind voice let them know the you are concerned that they don't understand what a Jew is.  Explain that it is Jewish Law that sets the rules, and the rules are that you either have a Jewish mom or you have made a formal conversion to Judaism.</p>\n<p>Assure them that there is nothing wrong with being non-Jewish; that the reason we don't proselytize is that no one really needs to be a Jew.</p>\n<p>Then suggest that on rare occasions someone might have such a great affinity for the People of Israel that they do want to join us, even though it means observing 613 laws.

Is this the case?</p>\n<p>A second possibility is that this is a person who is halakhically Jewish, but was not raised Jewish, and doesn't know any better, and has been hoodwinked into thinking that this Christian Church is an appropriate expression of his Yiddishkeit.  I believe such a person is seen as a \"captured child,\" not fully responsible for their actions.</p>\n<p>And a third possibility is that it is a case of true apostasy.</p>\n<p>I think in all cases, the person should be treated compassionately, but there would obviously be differences in what you might say.</p>\n<p>I'll wait for your clarification before I reply further.</p>\n\n\n",

Immediately prior to the verse (i.e. after the verse chronologically), once the angels came, Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 18:8</a> states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויקח חמאה וגו AND HE TOOK חמאה, ETC. — but he (Avraham) did not bring bread, on account of Sarah becoming mentstruant; as the 'way of women' returned to her that day, and the dough became impure (Bava Metzia 87a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the angels informed Sarah immediately once they cured her so that she could conceive. Informing her prophetically prior to that could also suggest to her that she might be giving birth unnaturally, which would put her life in big danger and add unnecessary stressful feelings. Also, we see that both Sarah's ability to conceive and the news of her upcoming pregnancy and giving birth and were contingent on Avraham passing the test of bris millah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can missionary arguments about free will be refuted?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In light of the fact that the majority of Christians including Catholics and Orthodox believe in predestination, as does Islam (in fact, one of Antony Flew's (\"the world's most famous atheist\") biggest reasons for being an atheist was that he correctly realized that if God exists He would be controlling everyone):</p>\n<p>I recently came across the following on chabad.org:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>QUESTION: \"If everything is predetermined by G‑d, then how should we live?\" ANSWER: As it is said, \"Everything is in the hand of G-d except the fear of G‑d.\" There is much that is pre-determined - but not our moral choices. You would have realized this for yourself if you had pushed your questioning one step further, that is: If everything is predetermined by G‑d, then how can He reward us or punish us? The only possible answer is that those aspects in our lives which incur reward or punishment are not under the control of destiny; they are truly free choices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this idea has serious support.  For example, Rashi commenting on Sotah 2a says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Do they in fact pair them up according to wickedness and merit? But before their formation, when his wickedness and meritoriousness are not known, they announce his match. And if you'll ask that everything is revealed before God, [the answer is that] everything is in the hands of Heaven except for fear of Heaven. As is stated in Tractate Niddah: \"the angel appointed over pregnancy takes a drop and brings it before the Omnipresent and says before Him, 'what will be with this drop? Strong or weak? Wise or foolish? Rich or poor?'\" But he does not say to Him 'righteous or wicked', since that is not in the hands of Heaven.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Maimonides clearly held this view as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“However, this is known without any doubt: That man's actions are in his [own] hands and The Holy One, blessed be He, does not lead him [in a particular direction] or decree that he do anything” (Hilchot Teshuva 5:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“if we should say that God had destined that this sum should pass into the hands of the one and out of the possession of the other, God would be preordaining an act of iniquity\" (Eight Chapters 8:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In making this assertion that obedience or disobedience to the Law of God does not depend upon the power or will of God, but solely upon that of man himself, the sages followed the dictum of Jeremiah, who said, \"Out of the mouth of God there cometh neither the bad nor the good\". By the words \"the bad\" he meant vice, and by \"the good\", virtue; and, accordingly, he maintains that God does not preordain that any man should be vicious or virtuous\" (Eight Chapters 8:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It now remains for us to explain another phase of this problem, which arises from the fact that there are several Scriptural passages in which some think they find proof that God preordains and forces man to disobedience\" (Eight Chapters 8:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ra'avad responding to Maimonides said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If the righteousness and wickedness of a person were dependent on the decree of God, we would say that His knowledge is His decree and we would have the very difficult question. But now that God has removed this dominion from His hand and given it to the hand of man himself, His knowledge is not a decree; rather, it is like the knowledge of the astrologers who know from another source what the ways of this person will be” (Hilchot Teshuva 5:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gersonides held this view and consequently denied that God knows the future:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[However,] human choice rules over this arrangement of their actions based on the celestial causes. And it is therefore possible that what people actually do is different from what God knew [they would do] based on the arrangement of their actions” (Commentary on Genesis 18).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This view is also strongly implied by the idea that rulers do not have free will, which seems to imply that if they had free will then God would not be in control of what they do.  This view is also strongly implied by the idea that you shouldn’t pray to be matched with a specific person.  This seems to be based on the notion that if you end up marrying someone because you chose to pray about it using free will then God couldn’t have predestined it.  This also seems to imply that free will is outside of God’s control.</p>\n<p>However God is the only First Cause which means that He willed everything about the universe including every decision made with free will.  Any other view is illogical (and polytheist).  So is it OK to say that these commentators acting out of a misguided desire to protect God’s goodness were simply wrong, but it doesn’t matter because Judaism doesn’t have dogmatic teachings about this sort of thing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The premise of this question is unfounded. You write \"However God is the only First Cause which means that He willed everything about the universe including every decision made with free will. Any other view is illogical (and polytheist).\" This claim does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p>G-d willed everything in the universe into existence, including a being that can make free choices, Man. That is what \"created in in the image of G-d\" means. G-d provides Man with multiple options and allows him/her to choose among them. G-d provides Man with the space to make these choices (G-d's will is necessary to effectuate those choices but the choices are Man's).</p>\n<p>The Torah expressly states this idea in Deuteronomy 30:15-20.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רְאֵ֨ה נָתַ֤תִּי לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙ הַיּ֔וֹם אֶת־הַֽחַיִּ֖ים וְאֶת־הַטּ֑וֹב וְאֶת־הַמָּ֖וֶת וְאֶת־הָרָֽע\n... וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ</p>\n<p>See I have placed before you live and good and death and evil ... And you should choose life in order that you and your offspring shall live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You've asserted that this position is illogical and polytheist but have provided no argument to support that position. Moreover, everyone (or nearly so) alive experiences free will on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Isn't it more likely that a universally experienced phenomenon exists and you just don't understand how it works, than it doesn't exist and G-d's just creating an illusion for his automatons to go through life deluding themselves that they can make choices?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>That claim is totally incompatible with Judaism.</p>\n<p>Reward and punishment are the result of moral choices.

    "title": "Why did Hashem wait three days to reveal to Avraham the exact place of the Akeida?",
    "content": "# Why did Hashem wait three days to reveal to Avraham the exact place of the Akeida?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Vayeira, it says that Hashem revealed to Avraham the exact place of the Akeidah on the third day of Avraham's journey. Rashi explains that Hashem waited three days in order to counter the claims of the Goyim that Avraham didn't have enough time to think about what he was about to do. With three days to ponder, he had a clear mind. My question is, what is significant about three days; would not have been one day enough to counter their claims?</p>\n<p>Maybe these three days have some connection to the third day that Hashem visited Avraham at the beginning of the Parsha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.56.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 56:1</a> there is a merit of the 3rd day, since the Torah was given on the 3rd day, while Rabbi Levi thinks it's the opposite, Avraham's Akkeida set the 3 days significance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes, and saw the place from a distance” (Genesis 22:4). “On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes” – it is written: “He will revive us after two days; on the third day, He will lift us, and we will live before Him” (Hosea 6:2). “On the third day” of the tribes, as it is written: “Joseph said to them on the third day, [do this and you shall live]” (Genesis 42:18). “On the third day” of the spies [sent by Joshua], as it is stated: “You shall hide there three days, […and then go on your way]” (Joshua 2:16). “On the third day” of the giving of the Torah, as it is stated: “It was on the third day” (Exodus 19:16). “On the third day” of Jonah, as it is written: “Jonah was in the innards of the fish three days and three nights” (Jonah 2:1). “On the third day” of those who ascended [to the Land of Israel] from the Diaspora [with Ezra], as it is written: “We remained there three days” (Ezra 8:32). “On the third day” of the revival of the dead, as it is written: “He will revive us after two days; on the third day, He will lift us” (Hosea 6:2). “On the third day” of Esther: “It was on the third day; Esther donned royal raiments [and stood in the courtyard of the king’s house]” (Esther 5:1). She wore the royal raiments of her ancestor’s household. By what merit [did Esther succeed in her mission on the third day]? The Rabbis and Rabbi Levi, the Rabbis say: <strong>It was by the merit of the third day</strong> on which the Torah was given, as it is stated: “It was on the third day, when it was morning” (Exodus 19:16). Rabbi Levi said: It was due to the merit of the third day of Abraham our patriarch, as it is stated: “On the third day, [Abraham lifted his eyes].”</p>\n<p>“And saw the place from a distance” – what did he see? He saw a cloud attached to the mountain. He said: ‘It appears that this is the place where the Holy One blessed be He told me to sacrifice my son.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, there were many events in the Jewish history that happened on the 3rd day, all of them are tied to either the Sinai revelation or Akkeidah (according to R. Levi). 3 days is usually sufficient time for complete preparation for undertaking an important mission (argument, counter-argument, resolution). Hashem made sure that all of them were done with clear mind and sufficient readiness. Just like Jewish people had to prepare themselves for <em>Matan Torah</em> so they had to prepare in each of the events presented by the midrash.</p>\n\n\n",

Let's break this down into steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step #1 - Baby 1 is born before Shkia (6:15), so his Bris will be on the following Friday.</li>\n<li>Step #2 - Baby 2 is born after Tzeis HaKochavim (7:20), so his Bris will be on the following Shabbos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rule that you can do a Bris on Shabbos is only when the actual date of the Bris falls out on Shabbos. If a baby is born during Bein HaShmashos (between Shkia & Tzeis HaKoChavim), it is considered as if he was born after Tzeis HaKoChavim. But this is still not his exact date for the Bris, since we aren't completely sure if he was born before or after the next day started. So, if a baby was born on Friday night Bein HashMashos, his Bris will not be on the following Shabbos, since a Bris only pushes off Shabbos if it is the correct date, and this isn't the 100% correct date.</p>\n<p>Now, let us say that Shabbos and Sunday are Yom Tov:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step #3 - Baby 3 is born during Bein HashMashos Friday night, and his mother is from Israel, so Sunday is not Yom Tov for them since they only hold of one day Yom Tov. So, his Bris will be in 2 Sundays, since this Bris won't push off Shabbos, so we do it the next Sunday.</li>\n<li>Step #4 - Baby 4 is born during Bein HashMashos Friday, but his Bris can't be on Shabbos or on Sunday (because it's Yom Tov), so his Bris will be in 2 Mondays.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>They are all non Jews and convert on different days.</p>\n\n\n",

(Water causes light to curve, so water molecules in the air can make the sun's light more curvy, meaning it is visible for longer while supposedly being below the horizon. So you would also have to calculate humidity between your position and the horizon.) You would be better off giving it a few minutes so you don't daven too early by mistake.

Why then, when Hashem tells Avraham that He's going to destroy Sodom, doesn't He say that He'll save Lot? Also, why doesn't Avraham ask Hashem what Lot's fate will be?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I think the answer is that Avraham knew that Hashem would save Lot. Either because Hashem told him and it is just not in the text (because it is not relevant for future generations) or because he saw two angels left for Sodom and if Lot was not being saved, only one angel would have been necessary. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.19.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See Rashi to Genesis 19:1</a>.</p>\n<p>That's why when Avraham prays for Sodom et al to be spared, he does not pray specifically for Lot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.29?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">who would be saved based on Avraham's merit</a>) but for the cities as a whole.</p>\n<p>I am editing my answer to add an additional peshat (explanation). Perhaps the reason Avraham does not daven for Lot is because he has given up on him. Lot first camped near Sodom because he was attracted by its wealth (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.13.10?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 13:10</a>), despite knowing that Sodom was <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.13.13?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">evil</a>.\nThen Lot was taken captive because he chose to live in or near evil Sodom. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.12?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 14:12, Rashi ad loc</a>.) Despite Lot bringing this tragedy upon himself, Avraham risked his life (and his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.1?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zechusim</a>) to save Lot.</p>\n<p>Then what does Lot do as soon as Avraham rescues him? He moves back to Sodom! He even becomes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.1?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.19.1.4&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a member of the government</a>. Lot should have moved as far from Sodom as he could. Instead, he ignored the cause of his suffering and went right back to the evil that enticed him the first time.</p>\n<p>So why should Avraham daven for him? Why should Avraham ask Hashem for special favors to save Lot? Lot had his chance and chose Sodom.</p>\n<p>Indeed, when the Torah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.29?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 19:29</a>) appears to say that Lot was saved from the merit of Avraham or for the benefit of Avraham, Rashi explains otherwise. Rashi explains that Lot was saved on his own merit for protecting Avraham's secret when they were in Egypt. Why does Rashi feel the need to read the verse differently than the simple reading? Because Avraham was no longer willing to use his merits to save his nephew. He was no longer going to bat for, or defending, Lot.</p>\n<p>Indeed, from this point forward Avraham has no connection to Lot in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There can be several answers.

And when they would not come with him, the angels said to him (Gen 19:15), “take the two daughters who are with you.” But Abraham thought all four of them were married.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This answer means that Hashem told Avraham about Lot. The opinion is contested by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.32?vhe=Presburg_:_A._Schmid,_1842&lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak on Bereshis 18:32</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא זכר לו לוט שיצילנו כי חשב שיכלה בכלל הרשעים כיון שנשתקע וישב אצלם ולא היה לו דרך להנצל אם לא יצא מן העיר, גם לא ידע אם היה צדיק או למד ממעשיהם.</p>\n<p>And he (Avraham) didn’t mention Lot, to ask for him to be saved, since he thought that he would be destroyed among the wicked, since he assimilated into them and dwelt with them, and he had no way to be saved unless he left the city. [Abraham] didn’t even know whether he (Lot) was still righteous or if he learned from their ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also have <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.29?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 19:29</a> (Thanks @Lo ani)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויזכר אלהים את אברהם GOD REMEMBERED ABRAHAM — What bearing has God’s remembering Abraham upon the rescue of Lot? He remembered that Lot knew that Sarah was Avraham’s wife and that when he heard that Avraham said in Egypt regarding Sarah, “She is my sister”, he did not betray him because he had sympathy with him. For this reason God had mercy upon him (Lot) (Genesis Rabbah 51:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point of this midrash is that treating guests well and making sacrifices for them Lot learned from Avraham. However, keeping silence to save his uncle was a <em>chidush</em> that Lot chose to do on his own. While according to Radak, Avraham did not mention Lot, Avraham certainly gratefully knew about Lot's merit. That could be sufficient for Lot to be saved without having Hashem directly telling Avraham about the Lot's fate.</p>\n\n\n",

The discussion culminates in a debate between בית שמאי and בית הלל, the latter of which, as usual, rules leniently. Since we generally follow the ruling of בית הלל over בית שמאי, it seems the final Halachah is that one may indeed kill a louse of Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Later on, in [107b], there is a law described against killing animals on Shabbat. Rashi claims that the reason for lice aren’t included in this prohibition, is because most animals reproduce normally, but lice spontaneously generate.</p>\n<p>Considering modern research has proved spontaneous generation a myth, does the Gemarah’s ruling still apply?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The פחד יצחק brings that question, and concludes that <strong>we do <em>not</em>.</strong> His reasoning is that, had חז״ל been exposed to modern scientific knowledge, they would have recanted their ruling that lice can be killed on Shabbat, and this would in the end be forbidden.</p>\n<p>It appears that, at least according to him, we don’t follow Halachot that were based on a now-disproven misunderstanding of חז״ל regarding nature.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source that Sarah laughed because she heard that the bracha for children was only temporary i.e. \"You call that a bracha?\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/132242/31534\">this answer</a> I quote a lecture by Rabbi Manis Friedman, where he explains that Sarah heard that the <em>beracha</em> from the angel was only going to be temporary. Her laughter was a form of protest; a mother praying for and defending her child.</p>\n<p>She knew this because a true <em>beracha</em> is meant to be given to the one being blessed, personally, but instead her <em>beracha</em> was actually told to Avraham. The lack of permanence was because of the Akeida - she was right and sensed that her son would die young.</p>\n<p>Thus the angel reassured her that he would personally return and ensure that the child would be ok. This very same angel was the one who appeared as Avraham was about to slaughter Yitzchak, and stopped him.</p>\n<p>A few more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>She was a greater prophetess than Avraham, which is why she figured it out but he didn't</li>\n<li>Part of it was also due to the difference. He was a \"seer\", she was a \"hearer\". She <em>heard</em> that the <em>beracha</em> was off</li>\n<li>A similar thing happened with the Shunamit woman, who also heard that her son would die young, from the wording of the <em>beracha</em>: \"you will coddle a child\". She didn't want to just coddle a child, she wanted him to grow up! So Elisha reassured her that he would personally see to it that he doesn't die young. When he died young, Elisha resurrected him</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is clearly from a <em>sicha</em> or a <em>maamar</em>. I could ask Rabbi Friedman but I would like the answer ASAP, and it takes time for me to get hold of him, and I try not to disturb him for scattered sources if possible. My own Baal Chassidus Rav is on holiday, but I have asked a few others (if they get back to me, I will answer my own question)</p>\n<p>So, does anyone know where I can find the (or a) source for these ideas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here is the drasha I ended up writing, that answers this question and quotes various sources to back it up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we said in Parashat VeZot HaBeracha, each year of our life, we\nlearn something new, deeper and more mature about the events and\npersonalities in the Torah. This week, I would like to present a new\nperspective on Avraham and Sarah, one that takes us to a higher level\nof appreciation of the gadlut. I want to defend them, as in this\nweek’s parasha, we find they both do something questionable, and as a\nresult, people view them negatively as a result, chas veshalom. I like\nto always try to defend the Kadmonim, because we know that they were\non the highest madregot, yet sometimes the Torah, the commentaries,\nand people in general, present a negative view of them, often one that\nis hard to understand given how holy and flawless they are!</p>\n<p>So I will start with Sarah Immenu. In this week’s parasha, she is\ninformed that she will have a child in her old age, and, famously, she\nlaughs. The standard understanding is disbelief. We are taught from a\nyoung age that she shouldn’t have laughed, because even though she was\ntoo old to have children, she should trust in Hashem, because He can\ndo anything. This doesn’t make sense, that Sarah, a greater prophetess\nthan Avraham, would think Hashem couldn’t make her pregnant? That’s\nnot giving her the credit she deserves.</p>\n<p>As we get older, we learn that it’s not so much that she didn’t\nbelieve that Hashem could give her a child, but that she felt she\ndidn’t deserve such a spectacular miracle. Better, yes, but at the end\nof the day, this now becomes a violation of Bitachon. We see time and\nagain, when someone turns to Hashem and says “Katonti- I am not\nworthy”, this is counted against them.</p>\n<p>It may sound like a praise – they were so humble that they truly\nbelieved they were not worthy, but it counts as a sin because we must\nfactor in that we are in a relationship with Hashem. In a\nrelationship, trust is essential. If my wife says she will do\nsomething for me, and I say “I doubt you will, because I will end up\nblowing it by being a bad husband”; if one party in a relationship is\nconvinced their partner doesn't love them <em>really</em>, and He is\nconstantly weighing their merits against their demerits, with His\nlove, favours and promises all contingent on the scale being on the\nside of merit, then there is something that needs correcting in this\nrelationship, to say the least.</p>\n<p>So, this is the real answer: Sarah didn’t laugh out of disbelief. She\nlaughed because she heard something wrong with the bracha. A bracha\nshould be given face to face, according to Hilchot Tefilla and the\nblessings of the Cohanim, as well as Ohr Hachaim’s commentary on the\nPasuk. But the bracha, which was exclusively for her according to\nYismach Moshe, was given to her husband and she therefore sensed that\nit was only a temporary bracha. She was right, Yitzchak was destined\nto die during the Akeda, so she lobbied for him, like a true, devoted\nmama. She laughed, saying “you call that a bracha?” And it worked, the\nangel reassured her that he would personally see to it that the child\nwould live, and indeed the same angel is the one who came to Avraham\nto tell him to not put his hand against Yitzchak!</p>\n<p>Sarah was a greater prophetess than Avraham, and she was a “hearer”,\n\"Sarah heard\", whereas Avraham was a seer \"he raised his eyes and he\nsaw\", which is why she sensed it, and Avraham missed it. She <em>heard</em>\nsomething wrong with the bracha, similar to how the Shunamit woman\nheard something wrong with her bracha – “you will coddle a child”. She\nwanted a child who would grow up, not just be coddled, and indeed\nElisha promised her that he would ensure this, and when the boy died,\nElisha resurrected him.

It teaches that hyssop of terumah that is impure, even if it is less that an egg size and would not make impure the מי חטאת, is still forbidden for sprinling since it is <em>impure</em>. The same is true for hyssop of <em>chulin</em> which is <em>impure</em>. In the case of the hyssop of terumah that is pure there are two cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the size of hyssop less than an egg, the hyssop that was prepared with purity stringencies of teruma would still be considered impure relative the stringences required for מי חטאת.</li>\n<li>Even if the size is more than an egg and the terumah was prepared with stringencies fitting for מי חטאת, one would still not use it for sprinkling, for perhaps accidentally there will be <em>psul</em> for sprinkling which will cause the מי חטאת cause impurity to the terumah and cause it to be disqualified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The relevant part to the OP's question is the second part of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Parah.11.7?lang=bi&with=Rash%20MiShantz&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Shimshon to Parah 11:7</a> comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושל תרומה. שלקטו לאכילה דחייב בתרומה ודאי דפסול בתרומה טמאה כדתנן לקמן בפ\"ב (מ\"ו) דאזוב טמא הזאתו פסולה והוא הדין של חולין טמאין ואגב סיפא דמחלק בתרומה טהורה דלכתחלה לא יזה נקט רישא תרומה וטעמא דלא יזה בטהורה כדאמרינן בסוכה (דף לה:) גבי אתרוג פליגי בה ר' אמי ור' אסי חד אמר מפני שמכשירה וחד אמר מפני שמפסידה:</p>\n<p>The hyssop was picked for eating is liable for terumah. Obviously, (sprinkiling) is disqualified for impure terumah, because it is taught in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Red_Heifer.15.9?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah 15:9</a> (the numbering is different), the hyssop that is impure is disqualified from sprinkling. The same is true with hyssop of impure <em>chulin</em>. The second part regarding hyssop of pure terumah, there is a distinction, <em>lehatchila</em> one should not sprinkle, as it is said in Succah 35b regarding esrog of terumah. There R' Ami and R' Asi argue about esrog of terumah taken for the mitzvah of lulav and becoming wet, whether it would make it susceptible to tumah or whether it will spoil it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One must conclude that the esrog in Gemara Succah was only designated for <em>terumah</em>, but remained <em>tevel</em>. This is different from the case of the mishnah, where the hyssop of terumah is already susceptible to <em>tumah</em>. Alternatively, if our hyssop is only designated for terumah (with all stringencies of מי חטאת), but not rendered susceptible, we should not use it <em>lehatchila</em> because מי חטאת will <em>makhshir</em> it and there may occur an accident which will disqualify it by impurity.</p>\n\n\n",

Messianic Prophecy for 5481?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Chevre,</p>\n<p>I have come across <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=s6M1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA260&dq=abraham,%20the%20famous%20rabbi%20of%20the%20tribe%20of%20levi&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLnt7EptmJAxW0hv0HHTTCEScQ6AF6BAgIEAI#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a passage from the Historical Register</a> which tells of the case of a false Messiah called Felix Coen, who was elected \"king\" on the basis of a certain \"Abraham of the tribe of Levi\", and who argued for the redemption to be brought about in the Jewish year 5481, i.e. 1721, according to an unclear calculation: add 3533 years (I have corrected the source below that mistakenly reads 4333 rather than 3533) since \"the birth of Abraham\", i.e. 1948 + 3533 = 5481, i.e. 1721.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/269Ig28M.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/269Ig28M.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>That the prophecy was wrong is obvious, since we live in a much worse world, especially after 7/10. However, I suppose that this \"Abraham of the tribe of Levi\" could well be our Abraham ben Eliezer Halevi (?) but his messianic calculations do not include anything close to these numbers. Assuming this is reasonable, how do you think they came up with the odd number 3533 and the even odder calculation of counting \"from the birth of Abraham\"? I have also noticed that both 3533 and 5481 were Jubilee years but I don't really know how to solve this.</p>\n<p>[EDIT]\nAfter doing some supplementary research myself, I can confirm that this event was connected to an obscure blood accusation in Ferrara. where Felix Coen lived as a wealthy business man (he died in 1738).\nThe source is “The Historical Register,\" 1721 (<a href=\"https://www.google.it/books/edition/The_Historical_Register/UcsPAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%E2%80%9Chistorical%20register%22%20%E2%80%9Cfelix%20coen%22&pg=PA261&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).\nMy interest here only focuses on the calculation of the 5481 as a messianic year by adding 1948 (Abraham's birth) to 3533 (Jubilee) on account of “Abraham Levi\"'s prophecy.\nI found NO evidence elsewhere of such calculation and such use of Abraham's birthday with messianic implications. Might it be something Sabbatean?\nAz, todah rabbah le-kulkhem!</p>\n\n\n",

They gave birth to two sons: Menashe and Ravshakeh. One day, Hezekiah was carrying the boys on his shoulders… whereupon one of them said, “father’s head would be suitable for roasting a small fish, while the other boy said father’s head would be suitable for offering an idolatrous offering. When Hezekiah heard this, he cast them down to the ground. Menashe survived, while Ravshakeh died.\" See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.10.9?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Aramaic%20Targum%20to%20Ecclesiastes&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum to Kohelet 10:9</a> on a different fate for Ravshakeh.</p>\n<p>It's stated that Chizkiyahu only had two sons, but the prophet Zephaniah from Trei Asar descends from Chizkiyahu, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zephaniah.1.1?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zephaniah 1:1</a>, \"The word of the Lord came to Zephaniah the son of Kushi, the son of Gedalya, the son of Amarya, the son of Chizkiyahu...\" This Chizkiyahu is the same as King Chizkiyahu according to Ibn Ezra, Malbim, and Radak commenting on the verse. However, there are two main problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is this third son of Chizkiyahu only mentioned here and nowhere else? There is no source external from Zephaniah 1:1 that Chizkiyahu had three sons, and all other sources strongly point to him having a maximum of two children. One answer to that is that perhaps Amarya is another name for one of his two sons, but besides for there being no tradition of this, problem 2 shows it is unlikely.</li>\n<li>From Zephaniah 1:1 we learn the rule that whenever we learn of a Tzaddik being introduced in the name of his father(s), and we never met his father(s) before, we can assume all introduced are Tzaddikim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.15a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 15a</a>). This means that Kushi, Gedalya, and Amarya were Tzaddikim. However, there is no indicator that Chizkiyahu had any non-evil children. Quite the opposite. The dialogue between Isaiah and Chizkiyahu in Berachot 10a, \"That which you are commanded, you are obligated to do; let the Holy One, then do as He sees fit,\" and \"The decree has already been issued,\" seem to say this is God's will, and Chizkiyahu can't change it. While he does later recover from his illness, we see through Menashe that his wish for good children didn't come true. And if out of all of Chizkiyahu's children, Menashe was the most fitting to rule, I would hate to imagine how Amarya turned out! And yet, Megillah 15a says Amarya was a tzaddik.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, I am wondering, how many sons does Chizkiyahu have? Why is Amarya only mentioned in Zephaniah 1:1 as Chizkiyahu's son and nowhere else?

People are compared to fish as mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.9.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles 9:12</a>, so he said that the merit of his father was to fry fish i.e. the evil men who would be cooked and get improved in the fire of the Torah. But Ravshakeh said bad and bitter words to sacrifice to <em>avodah zara</em>, since he was struck immediately by the fall, it was by heavely decree, for Chizkiyahu did not hit them with deadly strike. Thus, he was called Ravshakeh, same letters as <em>in falsity</em> (בהשקר). (Chizkiyahu) certainly did not disdain the honor of kingship before men, but did so with modesty, and his intention was for the sake of Heaven, to endear the Torah in the eyes of these children, so that they saw that he was a king and carried them on his shoulders for learning.</p>\n<p>Based in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.32.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 32:7</a>, <em>As for the knaves (vessels), their tools are knavish</em>, as it is said in (Sanhedrin 22b) that a woman only cuts a covenant with one who ‘makes her a vessel’... Chizkiyahu married to have children and it happened that <em>the vesels</em> from the side of his wife came out bad, so he said, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.38.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 38:17</a> <em>Truly, it was for my own good that I had such great bitterness ...</em>, because Menashe and Ravshakeh initials מ\"ר (bitterness). And there is no peace except a woman, and he hoped that the peace of the marriage that he had with the daughter of Isaiah would produce good sons for him, and now he saw that from peace he would produce מ\"ר bitterness, the initials of Manasseh, Rabshakeh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ben Yehoyada seems to agree with the indication of the OP that  Chizkiyahu only had two sons due to abbreviation מ\"ר. The first son Menashe, although called evil in gemarah Sanhedrin, actually repented 33 years before his death, as noted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.24.2?vhe=Seder_Olam,_Warsaw_1904&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabba 24:1</a>.</p>\n<p>The opinion that Chizkiya mentioned in the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zephaniah.1.1?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzephania 1:1</a> is king Chizkiyahu comes from ibn Ezra:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The scripture mentions the names of the fathers until it reaches the most honorable, which is King Hezekiah, and behold, according to the interpretation, Amariah was the brother of Manasseh. And do not be surprised because Josiah is third to Hezekiah, for there are more than a hundred years from the day Hezekiah grew up to father a son until Josiah became king.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tzephaniah was a prophet during the time of Yoshiyahu, as explained in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zephaniah.1.1?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">second part of Radak</a>. Radak actually disagrees with ibn Ezra and states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י\"א כי חזקיה זה חזקיה מלך יהודה ואפשר (אבן עזרא) אלא שאין בזה ראיה אבל באמת גדולים היו אבותיו לפיכך נזכרו</p>\n<p>There are those who say that Chizkiya is Chizkiyahu king of Yehudah and it is possible (ibn Ezra). Rather, there is no proof from these words (i.e. here in the verse). However, the ancestors of Tzephaniah were great people, that is why they were mentioned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, we cannot accept the opinion of ibn Ezra based on Ben Yehoyada, since Ravshakeh completely became lost to the Jewish people. It would be difficult to identify Amarya with repented Menashe, since then one would have to identify Kushi with children of Menashe, etc. Alternatively, ibn Ezra might have identified Amarya with Ravshakeh, since he may not be fully consistent with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.15a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilla 15a</a> that the names of ancestors mentioned must all be righteous, as we find with bnei Korach. In this case, one can translate the meaning of the name Amarya not as the usual Hashem Said, but as I will embitter (אמרר) Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

This was the vision of our forefathers and Hashem's purpose. Therefore, refusal to proceed is considered one of the worst sins we ever did, and is indeed practically unforgivable, as there is no alternative plan. Therefore the only solution was for Hashem to wipe us out, but Moshe prayed for the maximum amount of forgiveness possible. This was that Hashem spread out his anger over many generations, so that each generation only received a managable amount, and we went into גָּלוּת until all of the sin is atoned for.</p>\n<p>As for the point you made that the Jews were only afraid for seemingly legitimate reasons, i.e. they were worried that they would die not because Hashem can't protect them, but because Hashem would refuse to protect them because of their sins, this is considered a sin. Even Yaacov Avinu did this and it was counted as a sin. The basic explanation is, a true marriage is not conditional. If a wife thinks that her husband only loves her conditionally, and every day is watching to see if she will sin, and is constantly ready to back out of the relationship the moment she does, then surely the husband will be upset with her for this. He promised to be with her unconditionally, and she doubts it? <strong>That's a breach of trust, <em>bitachon</em>, in a relationship</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

And so when Sarah was conceived he must’ve been 7. Do any mefarshim address issues like this or give any creative answers, or do most ignore it or just say “nature was different back then”</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Seder haDoros <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_HaDorot%2C_Almanac.1916?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">year 1916</a>, Terach was 38 years old and had Haran and Nachor born (Sefer haYashar Noach). In the year 1948, Terach married a different woman named Amatlaah bas Carnevu who gave birth to Avram. I.e. Haran was older than Avram by 32 years. In the year 1955 Haran was 39 years old, he married a woman who gave birth to Lot, then Milka, and then Sarah. In the year 1958, Haran was 42 years when Sarah was born.</p>\n<p>Gemara Sanhedrin 69b states that Avram was older than Nahor by 1 year, and older than Haran by 2 years. So it implies that Haran was 8 when Sarah was born. I do not know how to reconcile all these numbers. It can be that Terach's 1st wife was getting very sick and died when Avraham was just 1 year old. Terach married Avraham's mother to help him with sick wife, who later adopted both Nachor and Haran.</p>\n<p>Regarding \"nature was different argument\" in year 1957 Seder haDoros states that Avram could have a child at the age of 9 years old. This is within halacha, but Haran's ability to do so at 8 is not. Thus, one may accept that the number 8 years is hinting to some additional information.</p>\n\n\n",

For this reason, he was commanded not to stop at all, nor even to look back to see whether the punishment, as foretold, would indeed come to pass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.17?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> also says that by looking back, Lot was giving the impression that he was not sure whether the city was really destroyed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to ascertain if the city behind him was really being destroyed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if we extrapolate the meaning of the words of R' Hoffmann, we can explain that by looking back, Lot was giving the impression that he lacked faith that G-d would destroy the city due to the sins of it's inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The Chida in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.17?lang=bi&with=Penei%20David&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pnei David (Bereishis 19:17)</a> hints to us that this posuk means that one should leave a sinning-environment and is instructed not to look back, e.g. one should leave his sins behind and not to stay at that place. By looking back, I think the Chida is learning us that Lot was not ready to \"move on\" from sinning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One can answer using the Rashi's comment to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.17?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 19:17</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל תבט אחריך LOOK NOT BEHIND THEE — You sinned with them but you are being saved through the merit of Abraham. <em>It is not fitting that you should witness their doom whilst you yourself are escaping</em> (Genesis Rabbah 50:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact, that one needs to have special merit to see the punushment of the wicked people by G-d, we learn from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.91.8-9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 91:8-9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You will see it with your eyes, you will witness the punishment of the wicked.

At the time to enter the Ark, Hashem closed the door behind Noach and did not let him watch destruction of the evil people. In other words, since even for the righteous Noach there was no permission to stare at the destruction, more so for the controversial person like Lot and his family.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, R'Moshe mentions 2 practical reasons regarding real danger when looking at the fire:</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Ramban on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.17?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 19:17</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking upon the atmosphere of a plague and all contagious diseases is very harmful, and they may cleave to him.

There I found that, at least in Rome, the Jewish community uses a unique prayer order that differs greatly from other nuschaot, like Sephardic and Ashkenazic.  Does Rome’s nusach predate others still in use?  What are the major differences that make it unique?  Also, why did the Italians continue to keep their own nusach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The description of <em>nussach Roma</em> or <em>Italian Rite</em> is presented in the <a href=\"https://www.j-italy.org/libraries/the-italian-rite/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> by Etan Fiorino based on the introduction to the <em>Siddur Benè Roma</em> by Rav Riccardo Di Segni. Some shortened adaptation of the article to answer the OP question is as follows:</p>\n<p>Italian Jewish community account a continuous settlement on the Apennine (Italian) peninsula for over twenty-two centuries. Traditional Hebrew name fo Italy - אי טל-י-ה - I-tal-yah - \"Island of Divine Dew\". Italian Jewish community follows traditions that are different from either Sephardi or Ashkenazi rites, which sets it apart from other communities in the Diaspora.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At present, it is kept alive only by a small population spread between Italy, Israel, and the Americas. It is currently maintained in Rome, Turin, and Milan, while in Florence and Venice it has merged with Sephardic and Ashkenazic traditions which imposed a different flavor... Until the <em>Shoah</em>, there were Italian synagogues in Mediterranean communities such as Salonica, but the devastation of those communities by the Nazis obliterated the last vestiges of Italian congregations that dated back hundreds of years. Today, outside of Italy, the Italian rite is only practiced in the Conegliano Synagogue in Jerusalem. The presence of Italian rabbis in cities including New York, Boston and Tokyo contributes to foster interest in this heritage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... Italian Jews have kept a unique set and order of prayers, cantillation style and original liturgical songs... They also developed their own specific legal codes, Judeo-Italian dialects and folkloric traditions that are not found elsewhere. ... This multilayered set of traditions, melodies, liturgical repertoire and cantillation style is known by different names: <em>minhag Qahal Qadosh Roma</em> (“of the sacred community of Rome”); <em>minhag lo’ez</em> or <em>lo’azim</em> (literally: “those who speak a foreign language”, probably in Latin); or <em>minhag Benè Roma</em> (“of the sons of Rome”), indicating the original centrality of Rome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elements of the Italian nusach, one can find in the work of Sa'adia Gaon, who was born in Eretz Israel, lived in Egypt and Babylonia. It is believed that Italian nussach is one of the vestiges of the nussach of Eretz Israel, while the Babylonian rites, represented by Seder Rav Amram Gaon, became more authoritative in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi world. The rites became nore normalized around 700 CE, \"due to a strong trend towards normalization of the liturgy and establishment of accepted practices emerged, leading to the development of a more fixed structure and set of prayers.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the Middle Ages, the prayer service had become relatively fixed. ... With the development of the printing press and further standardization of the liturgy, among the first printed Hebrew texts was the Soncino prayerbook of the Italian rite, published in 1486.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Italy occupies central geographic location and, for the most part, historically it provided relatively hospitable environment for Jewish life. Many waves of immigrants from both Ashkenazi and Sephardi world, came to Italy, where they opened own synagogues next to the local Italian ones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although Italian Jews have clung to their distinctive liturgy even when outnumbered by Ashkenazim or Sephardim, in this environment, cross-fertilization in liturgical practices was inevitable. Thus, in spite of the perceivable distinction of the Italian rite today, when taking a closer look at it, we discover that through centuries of migrations and encounters, the original Italian canon has absorbed a significant amount of traits from other Jewish worlds. Neverteless, the Italian nusach retains much of its distinctive character that remains cherished by Italian Jews wherever they may live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rav Samuel David Luzzatto (Shadal), <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/21241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction (Mavò) to the Machazor benè Roma</a>, Livorno 1856, 2</li>\n<li>Daniel Goldschmidt, “<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/21241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minhag benè Roma</a>”, Tel Aviv 1965</li>\n<li>I.Y.Kohn, “Bibliografia shel machazorim wesiddurè tefilla italiani”, in Mavò 1965</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Italian Machazorim</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Italian Machazor, Soncino e Casalmaggiore, 1485-86</li>\n<li>Machazor di rito italiano secondo gli usi di tutte le Comunità, curated by Rav Menachem Emanuele Artom, Roma 1998-Jerusalem 2005</li>\n<li>Italian Siddùr curated by Rav Panzieri, 1935</li>\n<li>Siddur di rito italiano secondo l’uso delle Comunità di Roma e di Milano, curated by Rav Riccardo Di Segno and Rav Elia Richetti, Morashà Milano, 2002</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

It's action that matters, not intent.   The Talmud [Kiddushin 40a] says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Evil intention is not combined with deed, [there is no punishment for mere intention], for it is said: \"If I saw iniquity in my heart, The Lord would not hear.\" [Ps. 66:18].  [Evil] intention which bears fruit [i.e., which is followed by action] the Holy One, blessed be He, combines with deed, [punishing both]. [Evil] intention which does not bear fruit the Holy One, blessed be He, does not combine with deed [and there is therefore no punishment].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here there is not even evil intention, only incompletely good intention, so this applies in spades.  Partial observance, or observance for the wrong reasons, is always better than no observance at all.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't believe there is any way to truly assess if someone's kindness is true and not for the sake of honor. Only Moshiach will be able to judge a person's true essence, and not be fooled by the senses (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.11.3?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 11:3</a>) and of the seven things that are hidden from man's knowledge, one is what is in the heart of another <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.65.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bereishis Rabbah 65:12</a>). However, not only are we unable to tell the intents behind someone's kindness, the Talmud seems to have many anecdotes that would appeal to those who do kindness Lo-Lishmah, speaking on matters of Olam Haba and Gehinnom, informing the reader how they will be rewarded with certain kindnesses. This information would not appeal to someone who does good deeds for no reward and want to do mitzvot simply Lishmah. It would seem that the Talmud wants as many readers as possible to add as much kindness as possible to the world, and is not bothered by intent. As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.16b.8?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arachin 16b</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A person should always engage in Torah <em>and mitzvot</em> even Lo-Lishmah, as through Lo-Lishmah, one will come to do them Lishmah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Comparing intentions vs actions, the Nefesh HaChaim concludes \"the essential part of all Mitzvot are the details of their physical performance\" (Shaar 1, Perek 22) and that \"purity of thought only complements the act of the mitzvah\" (Perakim, Perek 5). Furthermore, one should not not chide a lifelong learner who is clearly doing it for their own prestige, because there is an assumption they had a moment of Lishmah within a learning session, and those tiny moments within each session elevated all their learning (Perakim, Perek 4). While the Nefesh HaChaim refers only to learning Torah in that instance, perhaps we can apply this also to mitzvot (see below, second to last paragraph).</p>\n<p>In terms of how to improve and do kindness Lishmah, the best antidote is as mentioned above, to do many kindnesses Lo-Lishmah, because it will bring you to Lishmah. For example, it is better to give money to the homeless painfully than not at all. If one keeps doing it, it goes from painful to a habit. If they keep at it, it goes from a habit to a joy, and then to a highlight of the day. Another powerful antidote is daily Torah learning. As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.30b.4?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddishim 30b</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I created the yezter hara and I created for it the Torah as an antidote, and if you busy yourself with Torah you will not be delivered into its hand</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Related, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.1.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim 1:15</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer says, \"The people of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, Master of the Universe, we want to engage in Torah day and night, but we have no free time.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, \"Perform the mitzvah of tefillin, and I will consider it as if you were engaged in Torah day and night.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not to deviate too far from the subject, but one of the reasons why Tefillin has this ability is because it has the power to transform mitzvot done Lo-Lishmah to Lishmah. <a href=\"https://shvilei.com/wp-content/uploads/Archive-sp/English/Devarim/Ki-Savo/%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8F%E2%80%8FKi-Savo-78.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is the explanation of that idea</a>.</p>\n<p>The big barrier to doing kindness Lishmah is the Yetzar Hara. The Yetzar Hara is the ego and its drive towards honor (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.9.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 9:7</a>). As a result, the best remedy is to cultivate humility.

This\njourney lasted for about five years, from 1753 to 1758. Later, he\ncontinued writing about his second trip to Europe, which took place\nfrom 1772 to 1778. The initial purpose of this diary was to document\nthe miracles and kindnesses of Hashem that occurred during his\nmission. However, over time, he began to include other personal\nexperiences and the journal expanded, especially when he wrote about\nhis second journey, becoming more of a general diary. (Ma'agel Tov, Hakdamah, p. 13-14)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my edition of the <a href=\"https://www.shopeichlers.com/products/magal-tov-volume-1/57949?srsltid=AfmBOops-gzfgkiYeM5XX5UPiIeDk0vrY3e2vL6fxCrjBm2y1tT6QQej\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'agel Tov of the Chida (Shira-Mishor, Rabbi Assaf Raviv)</a>, in the introduction, it does not give any information on why the Chida chose especially for his sefer to be called \"the good circle\" (English for Ma'agel Tov).

Since there is no further explanation of the name in the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=67672&st=&pgnum=16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">short introduction</a>, I can only guess the reason is that a reference to a path is appropriate for a travelogue.</p>\n\n\n",

Even if he would have bought it he would have had difficulty making it into a burial spot later on anyway. The Chizkuni says the reason he assembled everyone and told them what he is looking to do with the property  instead of just dealing with Efron is because he needed permission from everyone to turn a plot of land into a burial spot. (they must have had zoning laws back then too). Such permission would  be a lot easier to get as an actual resident currently looking to bury a  relative than it would be as a stranger who isn’t sure he is going to remain there but is looking to bury someone there at a unknown future date.</p>\n<p>Rashi says on the words  גֵּֽר־וְתוֹשָׁ֥ב אָֽנֹכִ֖י עִמָּכֶ֑ם that he didn’t have to buy it all.

Yesterday You said: “For it is through Isaac that will be called your descendants” (Genesis 21:12), then You said: “Take you your son […and offer him up]” (Genesis 22:2), and now You say to me: “Do not extend your hand against the lad”? This is bewildering.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘“I will not violate My covenant, nor alter the utterance of My lips” (Psalms 89:35) – when I said to you: “Take you your son,” I did not say: “Slaughter him,” but rather, “<strong>take him up.</strong>” I said this to you in affection. You have taken him up and fulfilled My words, now take him down.’</p>\n<p>[Another version: They gave a parable of a king who said to his beloved one: \"Bring your son up to my table.\" The beloved one brought him, with a knife in his hand. The king said to him: \"Did I tell you to bring him up in order to slaughter him? I told you to bring him up because of my affection for him.\"\nThis is as it is written (Jeremiah 19:5) \"It never entered my mind\" – this refers to Isaac.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, gemara Sanhedrin 107a teaches</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב לעולם אל יביא אדם עצמו לידי נסיון שהרי דוד מלך ישראל הביא עצמו לידי נסיון ונכשל אמר לפניו רבש\"ע מפני מה אומרים אלהי אברהם אלהי יצחק ואלהי יעקב ואין אומרים אלהי דוד אמר אינהו מינסו לי ואת לא מינסית לי אמר לפניו רבש\"ע בחנני ונסני שנאמר (תהלים כו, ב) בחנני ה' ונסני וגו'</p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: A person should never bring himself to undergo an ordeal, as David, king of Israel, brought himself to undergo an ordeal and failed. David said before God: Master of the Universe, for what reason does one say in prayer: God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, and one does not say: God of David? God said to David: They have undergone ordeals before Me, and you have not undergone an ordeal before Me. David said before Him: Examine me and subject me to an ordeal, as it is stated: “Examine me, Lord, and subject me to an ordeal; try my kidneys and my heart” (Psalms 26:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Artscroll comment states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Patriarchs earned the priviledge of having My name affixed to theirs because they withstood all the tests of faith to which they were subjected. Abraham was subjected to 10 tests (Avos 5:3 and Avos deRabbi Nassan 33:2). <strong>Isaac was ready and willing to be slaughtered as an offering at My behest (Bereshis 22)</strong>. Jacob endured a life of suffering, yet he persevered in his faith (Rashi to Bereshis 43:14, Sanhedrin 111a). You David, on the other hand, have never been subjected to a test of faith as severe as those to which the Patriarchs were subjected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why did Yitzchak have to go through the Akkeida, and what exactly it revealed to the world regarding him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Arizal says Yitschak was misaken Adams Chait of ritzicha by the Akeida when he sacrificed his life for hashem.</p>\n<p>(Arizal explains how each of the Avos were misaken different sins of Adam)\n(Toras chida , Pnei dovid begining of Vaetza)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why shouldn't the Israelites have been asleep when God gave the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On Shavuot eve, we have a custom of staying up all night to study Torah, to make amends because, when the Israelites were about to receive the Torah at dawn, they were sleeping, and God had to awaken them with thunder and lightning. The Midrash [Song of Songs Rabbah 1:12] even says that God taunted them through the mouth of Isaiah, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is it that when I came, no man was there; when I called, no one was there to answer? [Is. 50:2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not in the Torah.  The Torah [Ex. 19:16] only says it happened \"בִּֽהְיֹ֣ת הַבֹּ֗קֶר -- When morning came into being\", i.e. at dawn.  Why shouldn't the Israelites be sleeping as dawn breaks?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Chaim Goldwicht z\"l (אספת מערכות פרשת יתרו - sorry, no available link) has a lengthy and deep lecture to explain why they felt it important to sleep. Without delving into his words again, this is in short, and on a superficial level, the way I remember them. Any unclarity is my fault. The reason why they went to sleep was not due to an indifference to the forthcoming Revelation. On the contrary. They thought it was an essential preparation. Whilst awake, we can only achieve a limited amount of Torah knowledge, as our physicality acts as a wall between the spiritual world where the knowledge of תורה resides. That barrier disappears greatly whilst asleep, which is why all prophets, besides Mozes who was constantly on a high spiritual level, received their prophecies in a stage of sleep/trance. The knowledge attained whilst asleep can then be further developed upon awaking. In fact, many Torah giants throughout all generations, after they had toiled in Torah with all their might during the day, but were still left with unresolved questions, merited to a solution to their questions during the short sleep which they allowed themselves. To be sure, this only applies to people who use their awake hours to toil in Torah. Those who waste their days, will not become more knowledgeable whilst asleep. The Jewish people had travelled 49 days towards the giving of the Torah. During all that time they were preparing for that great Divine Revelation. However, they thought that they would be incapable to be grasp those high revelations whilst awake. Whilst their body was “dressed” on their soul. And indeed, when they eventually heard the first words of the ten commandments, they, in their physical state, couldn't cope with it. That is why they went to sleep. But they were wrong. The words of Torah can only be handed over with the full cooperation of the recipient and for that one has to be awake. What made them make that mistake? Here human nature comes to play. Perhaps, deep down, there was an element of laziness involved. By staying up Shavuos night we want to be repair that small element of laziness and thus merit to absorb the full measure of spirituality our soul is capable off.</p>\n\n\n",

Isaac\nthen re-dug a well, representing the conduit of awe, in accordance\nwith his attribute. This is why it says, \"And they quarreled over it,\nsaying, 'The water is ours.'\" The meaning is: \"We want to serve God\nthrough the attribute of love,\" because there also exists an external\nform of awe. <strong>Therefore, Isaac dug another well, representing inner\nawe, which is called Rechovot (\"spaciousness\"). For through this, \"God\nhas made room for us.\" Inner awe is called Rechovot. Reflect on this.</strong>\nAs is known to those with understanding, one can create unity even\nthrough speaking with a friend, or through diverting sadness by\nengaging in a certain task. This, too, constitutes unity, as mentioned\nthere, in reference to the two jesters (anei trei bedichai), who\ncreated unity and elevated worlds through all worldly matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, I am not a person of understanding, but we have had 300 years since then to come up with an explanation, so perhaps it's ok for me to ask:</p>\n<p><strong>What is the explanation?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Toldot_Yaakov_Yosef%2C_Toldot.20?vhe=Toldot_Yaakov_Yosef,_Korets,_1780&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This Toldot Yaakov piece</a> offers a mashal, but I would still appreciate a deeper and more intuitive understanding of what is \"Rechovot\", and what is the point that the Besht is trying to make here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Manis Friedman explains it in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMyBcYSako0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this video</a>, which is based on a Sicha given on Shabbat Parashat Acharei 5741, and is found in Likkutei Sichot vol. 30 p. 103FF.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is as follows. There is Chesed, and there is Gevura. Traditionally we understand them to be opposites: Chesed is about closeness, and Gevura is about distance. When I want to bridge gaps and get close, I am engaged in Chesed, but when I want to put limits and restrictions, I am engaged in Gevura.</p>\n<p>However, the truth is when one engages in the process of restriction, the end result is total bittul; total humility, and this, ironically, causes spaciousness within, rather than restriction, because one has risen above limitation.</p>\n<p>One way Rabbi Friedman put it, that I really like, is that when we receive Chesed, we feel whole, complete, rich. If even more chesed were to be applied, we wouldn't be able to take it, because we are already full. Indeed, if more Chesed were thrust upon us, it would \"blow our fuse\", the fuse of our ego, and that would unlock our capacity, creating more space to receive more goodness than we ever thought possible.</p>\n<p>Gevura, ultimately, is called \"severity\", because it is \"so much good, it is severe\". <strong>Unlimited, infinite Chesed.</strong></p>\n<p>He also explains how this is how we grow, when we start to see beyond our own limitations. People usually can't imagine themselves being in a better place, and it's that lack of imagination (this is where Binah comes in), that lack of \"Rechovot\", that actually prevents them from achieving that better place. I highly recommend the short talk.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question is a good one and is essentially asking what does the Ba'al Shem Tov mean about this particular type of well, which the Patriarch Yitzchok dug and was called <strong>Rechovot</strong> (רחבות)</p>\n<p>So first, let's look at the specific wording of the teaching from the Ba'al Shem Tov.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל הבארות אשר חפרו בימי אברהם שהם צנור החסד ואהבה סתמום במות אברהם\nוישב יצחק ויחפור באר וצנור היראה כמדתו ע\"כ ויריבו לאמר לנו המים פי'\nאנחנו רוצים לעבוד ה' ע\"י מדת אהבה כי יש יראה חצוניות ג\"כ. ע\"כ ויחפור\nבאר אחרת ירא' פנימית ונק' רחובות כי הרחיב ה' לנו ופנימיות היראה נק'\nרחובות והבן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And all the wells which were dug during the days of Avraham, which were an <em>irrigation channel</em> (of the qualities of) <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>love</strong> חסד ואהבה, they (the Philistines, who are from the Sitra Achre) sealed with the death of Avraham.</p>\n<p>Yitzchok returned and dug <em>a well</em> and <em>irrigation channel</em> of (the quality of) <strong>the Fear</strong>, corresponding to his constitution.</p>\n<p>Therefore, (<em>because the constitution of <strong>Yitzchok</strong> is the opposite of <strong>Avraham</strong>, meaning from the side of <strong>Severity</strong></em> גבורה) and they quarreled (<em>meaning the Philistines quarreled</em>) saying, <em>the water belongs to us</em>. (<em>That <strong>absolute Severity</strong> has a connection to the Sitra Achre and the Philistines. They gain sustenance from it, so to speak. This is the concept of <strong>the Tzimtzum HaRishon</strong> through which <strong>Creation Ex-Nihilo</strong> occurred and <strong>the Universe of Tohu</strong> and <strong>the Sitra Achre</strong>.</em>)</p>\n<p>This means, <em>we want to serve G-d through the aspect of Love</em>, that has an external aspect of Fear too.</p>\n<p>Therefore, (because <strong>Yitzchok</strong>, whose constitution is from <strong>the side of Gevurah</strong>, the <em>opposite of Avraham</em>, whose constitution is <em>from the side of Chesed</em>) he dug another well, <em>Inner Fear</em>, and called it <strong>Rechovot</strong>, because now G-d has made room for us <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.26.22?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bereshit 26:22</a>). And understand that <em>the quality of Inner Fear</em> is called <strong>Rechovot</strong> רחבות.</p>\n<p>To understand this on a deeper level we will turn to the teaching of Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles in Kehillat Yaacov, in connection to <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=260\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רחבת</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=261\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רחובות</a>.</p>\n<p>רחבת: ראשי תיבות למפרע תוהו בהו חשך רוח. ועלייהו שרייה שדי, צבאות, אלהים-יהוה כמבואר בזוהר בראשית. וזהו סוד והארץ הנה רחבת, והארץ הוא זעיר ונוקבא כמו ויהוה הוא ובית דינו. והוא סוד יהוה-אלהים. הנה הוא ראשי תיבות ה״יסוד, נ״צח, ה״וד והוא סוד שדי צבאות והן שורים על רחבת, ר״וח ח״שך, ב״הו, ת״והו. ואנון נחש, שרף, עקרב, צמאון כמבואר בתקונים  דף קכג:ב</p>\n<p>Rachevet (רחבת): Is the reverse acronym of Tohu (Void) ת׳הו, Vohu (Formless) ב׳הו, Choshech (Darkness) ח׳שך, Ruach (Storm Wind) ר׳וח. Upon them rule the Holy names: Shaddai, Tz'va'ot, and יהוה pronounced Elohim, like is clarified in the Zohar, parshat Bereshit. And this is the secret of, \"the land is large enough for them\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.34.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 34:21</a>). The word, \"the land\"  used here means Ze'ir Anpin and Nukvah, like with the expression of the Sages, <em>G-d and His Court</em>. And this is the secret of G-d's name יהוה when it is pronounced Elohim.</p>\n<p>The word, \"Behold\" הנה is the acronym: HaYesod, Netzach, Hod. This is the secret  of the Holy names Shaddai and Tz'va'ot. They rule over Rachevet, which is the acronym for Storm Wind, Darkness, Formlessness, Void. These correspond to Nachash, Saraph, Scorpion and Thirst (in regard to the Sitra Achra) like is clarified in the Tikkunim, page 123b.</p>\n<p>רחובות נקראת בינה שהוא רחב נחלה בלי מצרים והפרדס כתב בסוד התפשטותה על הבנים נקראת רחובות בסוד ברחבות פלגי מים. ויש לבין רחובות גימטריא בינה פשות ומלא בינה בי׳ת, יו׳ד, נו׳ן, ה׳י וב׳ כוללים. גם רחובות עם הכולל גימטריא בינה עלמא דאתי. שהבינה נקראת כן כנודע. ומבואר בזוהר תולדות שהוא בחינת יסוד דבינה.</p>\n<p><strong>Rechovot</strong> is called <strong>Binah</strong>.

(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.5.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 5:16</a>)</p>\n<p>It is necessary to understand that <strong>Rechovot</strong> (רחובות, which is gematria 622) is the gematria of <strong>Binah</strong> <em>in its plain form combined with its Miluy when counting the 2 whole names</em>.</p>\n<p>בינה, בי׳ת, יו׳ד, נו׳ן, ה׳י</p>\n<p>Also, <strong>Rechovot</strong> (gematria 622) is the gematria of <em>Binah is the World To Come</em> (בינה עלמא דאתי) (<em>It is referring to the time of the resurrection of the dead.</em>), when including the count for the whole phrase and Binah is called this, like is known.

And there (<em>in Eden</em>) it is <em>a broad and deep inheritance without limitations or restrictions</em>. This is not the case when it comes into six dimensional space (of Zei'r Anpin).

Evil people with evil ideas should not be given microphones.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, can we draw any wisdom or rules from the Torah on how to manage this tension?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Judaism does not have a clear statement on freedom of speech.  So must examine the issues one by one.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, the Talmud itself testifies to such freedom, within broad bounds.  It includes vigorous and feisty discussions, followed by minority opinions, followed by the majority opinion, which is usually the final decision.  Opposing viewpoints are welcome.  As we often hear, two Jews will produce three opinions.  The Mishnah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵיזֶהוּ חָכָם, הַלּוֹמֵד מִכָּל אָדָם -- Who is wise? He who learns from everyone. [Avot 4:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Jewish law prohibits many types of speech for ethical and religious reasons: blaspheming God, pretending to be a prophet, speaking against the king, disrespecting a rabbi or contradicting him in private or in public [Rashi on Numbers 25:6-7], speaking ahead of someone who is wiser [Avot 5:7], cursing people, or teaching the opposite of a ruling of the Sanhedrin.  The most reviled form of speech is malicious gossip, or lashon hara.</p>\n<p>Also prohibited is being rude or insulting (Onaat devarim אוֹנָאַת דְבָרִים, literally “hurting people with words”.  The Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Torah states “Do not wrong one another” וְלֹ֤א תוֹנוּ֙ אִ֣ישׁ אֶת־עֲמִית֔וֹ – [Leviticus 25:17], it includes intentionally saying something that will hurt, frighten or embarrass someone. Whoever does this has no share in the World to Come. [Bava Metzia 58b-59a; Sefer HaChinuch 338; Shulḥan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 228:1.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, lies are forbidden, unless uttered to save a life, keep the peace, make people feel good, appear humble and modest, or protect oneself from loss or harm.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think there are two angles on this.</p>\n<h3>Unfair comparison</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Democracy_in_relation_to_social_interaction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Free speech</a> seems to be a democratic principle, and is a necessity in a system where \"right and wrong\" are not absolute (or at least, impossible to full capture, systematically), so should be something that the people can discuss and debate. Hence, the law of free speech is enshrined in constitutions etc. you can't be suppressed by force simply for saying what you believe is right or wrong.</p>\n<p>Torah, on the other hand, <em>is</em> a system of right and wrong, therefore it does not allow someone to stand up and advocate for idolatry, for example. However, it does have somewhat of an equivalent - debating the Oral Law. The Oral Law has become fuzzy over time, so we have had to engage in honest debate to try to get to the bottom of the Law, but ultimately a decision should be made and adhered to, once the debate has arrived at its conclusions, and at that point we are no longer free to debate it (although we can always re-open a debate with a strong enough <em>kashe</em>)</p>\n<h3>Free will</h3>\n<p>The Torah explains that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/132826/source-for-god-created-this-world-so-that-we-serve-him-with-free-will/132827#132827\">we are meant to have free will</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not be coerced to be good</a>. Therefore we are given, <em>practically</em>, freedom of speech, and other freedoms, to a great degree. The difference is, that freedom is only for the purpose of using it for good. If it is not used for good, then, unlike democratic free speech, it can be punished. If someone wants to advocate for idolatry, they can, but they will be executed!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sources for pretty much everything I've written here can be found in this answer: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136443/why-do-rabbis-say-that-hashem-was-mistaken-and-hashem-states-that-he-was-defeate/136448#136448\">Why do Rabbis say that HaShem was mistaken and HaShem states that He was defeated and that He must obey the Rabbis?</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Aside from the laws of <em>Lashon haRa</em> and cases in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Chagigah.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Chagiga 2:1</a>, the mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.17?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 5:17</a> teaches:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל מַחֲלֹקֶת שֶׁהִיא לְשֵׁם שָׁמַיִם, סוֹפָהּ לְהִתְקַיֵּם. וְשֶׁאֵינָהּ לְשֵׁם שָׁמַיִם, אֵין סוֹפָהּ לְהִתְקַיֵּם. אֵיזוֹ הִיא מַחֲלֹקֶת שֶׁהִיא לְשֵׁם שָׁמַיִם, זוֹ מַחֲלֹקֶת הִלֵּל וְשַׁמַּאי. וְשֶׁאֵינָהּ לְשֵׁם שָׁמַיִם, זוֹ מַחֲלֹקֶת קֹרַח וְכָל עֲדָתוֹ:</p>\n<p>Every dispute that is for the sake of Heaven, will in the end endure; But one that is not for the sake of Heaven, will not endure. Which is the controversy that is for the sake of Heaven? Such was the controversy of Hillel and Shammai. And which is the controversy that is not for the sake of Heaven? Such was the controversy of Korah and all his congregation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it is not the subject of discussion, but intent of the discussion that is at the core of permissibility. For example, Korach questioned validity of Aharon's appointment to kehuna by asking about a garment with 4 corners made out of techeles. Such a question is clearly forbidden due to its intent.  However, Korach could ask about the <em>meil</em> of Kohen Gadol, which had 4 corners and was made out of techeles, whether it was liable for tzitzis, whithout any other implications regarding anyone.

A soul living inside her is fully aware of the mother's pain and suffers with her. After a child is born it cries (suffers) from the loss of the Torah learned during pregnancy, experiences the pain of growing, from pain of getting able to digest food to pain of adjusting to society, teachers, etc. The suffering in life is common for many people. Many people die before their time because of various reasons (sins, improper lifestyle, bad eating habbits, etc.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The second answer is midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.65.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 65:9</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יִצְחָק תָּבַע יִסּוּרִין, אָמַר לְפָנָיו רִבּוֹן כָּל הָעוֹלָמִים אָדָם מֵת בְּלֹא יִסּוּרִים מִדַּת הַדִּין מְתוּחָה כְּנֶגְדּוֹ, מִתּוֹךְ שֶׁאַתָּה מֵבִיא עָלָיו יִסּוּרִים אֵין מִדַּת הַדִּין מְתוּחָה כְּנֶגְדּוֹ. אָמַר לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא חַיֶּיךָ דָּבָר טוֹב תָּבַעְתָּ וּמִמְּךָ אֲנִי מַתְחִיל, מִתְּחִלַּת הַסֵּפֶר וְעַד כָּאן אֵין כְּתִיב יִסּוּרִין וְכֵיוָן שֶׁעָמַד יִצְחָק נָתַן לוֹ יִסּוּרִים, וַיְהִי כִּי זָקֵן יִצְחָק וַתִּכְהֶיןָ.</p>\n<p>(Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said) Isaac demanded suffering.

The surface of the palm contains many nerve endings and these nerve endings can be stimulated through touch which may or may not be appropriate depending on the situation. Sensual hand touching is very much a practiced act.</p>\n<p>Fist bumping circumvents the issue entirely. Our knuckles are a bony outgrowth on our hands. There are nowhere near as many nerve endings as there are on the palms of our hands. A fist bump allows two Jews of the opposite sexes to show greetings and affection without touching parts of the body which may become stimulated by skin on skin contact.</p>\n<p>I'd argue fist bumping may actually be the best form of greeting for observant Jews (outside of no touching at all)</p>\n<p>I'm curious as to whether this topic has been discussed and if the logic I am using follows based on contemporary interpretations of Jewish practice?</p>\n\n\n",

In the Song at the Sea, the Jews said (Exodus 15:2) זֶ֤ה אֵלִי֙ וְאַנְוֵ֔הוּ, which the Talmud (Shabbos 133b) interprets to mean This Is My God (which by the way is the title of a recommended book by Herman Wouk) and I will beautify Him.  Quoting that passage in the Talmud from Sefaria:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, here, with regard to circumcision, where we need to fulfill the mitzva of: “This is my God and I will glorify Him,” which requires performing the circumcision in a beautiful manner, indeed, Rabbi Yishmael would agree that the mitzva must be performed as aesthetically as possible.\nדְּתַנְיָא: ״זֶה אֵלִי וְאַנְוֵהוּ״, הִתְנָאֵה לְפָנָיו בְּמִצְוֹת: עֲשֵׂה לְפָנָיו סוּכָּה נָאָה, וְלוּלָב נָאֶה, וְשׁוֹפָר נָאֶה, צִיצִית נָאָה, סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה נָאֶה, וְכָתוּב בּוֹ לִשְׁמוֹ בִּדְיוֹ נָאֶה, בְּקוּלְמוֹס נָאֶה, בְּלַבְלָר אוּמָּן, וְכוֹרְכוֹ בְּשִׁירָאִין נָאִין.\nWhat is the source for the requirement of: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”? As it was taught in a baraita with regard to the verse: “This is my God and I will glorify Him [anveihu], the Lord of my father and I will raise Him up.” The Sages interpreted anveihu homiletically as linguistically related to noi, beauty, and interpreted the verse: Beautify yourself before Him in mitzvot. Even if one fulfills the mitzva by performing it simply, it is nonetheless proper to perform the mitzva as beautifully as possible. Make before Him a beautiful sukka, a beautiful lulav, a beautiful shofar, beautiful ritual fringes, beautiful parchment for a Torah scroll, and write in it in His name in beautiful ink, with a beautiful quill by an expert scribe, and wrap the scroll in beautiful silk fabric.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How should religious Jews (and Noahides) respond to these criticisms\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m curious how the community here would recommend responding to these criticisms of the claim that God exist: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ExBsyaiRYW4?feature=shared\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/ExBsyaiRYW4?feature=shared</a>. To summarize (although please for anybody who doesn’t have YouTube completely blocked, watch it yourself and try and formulate a response), his argument is twofold: he claims that since God’s nature involves infinity, omnipotence, omniscience etc., God can’t exist because of the metaphysical axiom of the law of identity (his philosophical tradition is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Objectivism</a>, the philosophy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ayn Rand</a>). Second, he formulates that God isn’t possible because he asserts God is absolutely arbitrary, there is no evidence for it and since there is no evidence there is no demonstration of possibility, if one can’t even demonstrate something is possible how can one reasonably believe in it? After all, why should one believe in invisible goblins on Venus who read Mark Twain books if there is no evidence for that? I believe in God, however I would appreciate community input.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>First, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_identity#:%7E:text=In%20logic%2C%20the%20law%20of%20identity%20states%20that,of%20logic%20are%20built%20on%20just%20these%20laws.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the law of identity</a> states that each thing is identical with itself. G-d is identical with G-d. The speaker in the video twists the application of the law by stating that everything in this world is finite, and any action of G-d in this world is finite, therefore a finite collection of finite things should be representative of what G-d is. This way god is identified with nature, which actually was done by Hitler and his national socialist philosophers. The problem is that in Judaism G-d does not live inside the universe. As we state in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.1.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles 1:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only that shall happen Which has happened, Only that occur Which has occurred; <em>There is nothing new Beneath the sun!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, there is nothing new beneath or under the sun, i.e. inside the universe (i.e. finite dimensional). But from G-d who is outside the universe, i.e. from \"above the sun\", we do get novelty - prophesy, prophetic visions, and any kind of novel ideas. We believe not only in the infinite and omnipotent G-d, but also that He will give us infinite reward for our mitzvos.</p>\n<p>Second, the existence of \"god who can change laws of nature at a whim, negates any need to know laws of science\", which is nonsense. Such a point is also not applicable to Judaism. G-d does not change anything at a whim. The miracles defying natural laws were designed from the 6 days of creation (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.6?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 5:6</a> for example). In fact the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.93.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 93:1</a> clearly states that G-d is not changing any natural laws at a whim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The LORD is king, He is robed in grandeur; the LORD is robed, He is girded with strength. <em>The world stands firm; it cannot be shaken.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, the speaker invents a false premise and uses it as a pretext to defy the \"competing ideology\" by using 2 false witnesses. That's a totally marxist way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The speaker is making a few assumptions, and appears to admit that is because he is <em>presupposing</em> the truth of objectivism, and its atheistic implications, i.e. that there is lack of evidence for God, and there are metaphysical contradictions. I would say that he has a very left-brained, rational mind, and therefore views everything logically/rationally and materialistically. Therefore, ultimately, he can't conceive of God because he has no clue about how to apply his intellect outside of the limitations of logic.</p>\n<p>He may not realise it, but he thinks that God must be some sort of object, and when he follows the logic there, he arrives at contradictions. However, not only does Torah not presume that God is an object, but also makes theological conclusions about God that this gentleman's line of thinking would consider \"impossible\" or contradictory.</p>\n<h4>The Law of Identity proves that God doesn't exist</h4>\n<p>False witness. The Law of Identity only disproves a God if God is meant to obey the law, but why should He? He does not have to follow any rules given that He created the rules themselves!</p>\n<p>As I said, God is not an object or category.</p>\n<p>All of the \"logical paradoxes\" from applying the law of identity to an infinite or undefined being <em>are true</em> regarding God. We do assert that He is indistinguishable from nothing, to us, in the sense of \"yesh m'ayin\"; something from nothing. In fact, we apply this principle to the entire spiritual cosmos, and then declare that God is exalted above even the spiritual cosmos, so how much more so does this argument not apply to God.</p>\n<p>To put it in terms of greek philosophy, the argument being made in the video assumes that all is corporeal. The rule of identity applies in the corporeal sense that two different objects can be identical, and still exist independantly. In the spiritual cosmos, there is no corporeality, only form. If two forms are identical, they wouldn't be two, but would be the same. However, to be identical, they need to have a property or description, and would thus be composite. This does not apply to God, who cannot be composite. See Moreh Nevuchim 1 and 2 for the full discussion, who dealt with this by tackling the greek philosophy, and see Maharal, Gevurot Hashem, Hakdama 2 for the general philosophy of Torah on this theological point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל הוא יתברך שקראו רז\"ל בשם \"הקדוש ברוך הוא\", ולא נקרא \"השכל ברוך\nהוא\", כי אמיתת עצמו לא נודע, רק שהוא נבדל מכל גשם וגוף ומכל הנמצאים,\nועל זה נאמר \"קדוש ברוך הוא\", שענין \"קדוש\" נאמר על מי שהוא נבדל, כי הוא\nיתברך פשוט בתכלית הפשיטות. ומזה בעצמו שהוא בתכלית הפשיטות, אין דבר\nנבדל ממנו, כי הדבר שיש לו גדר ומיוחד בדבר מה, בשביל אותו גדר נבדל ממנו\nדבר שאינו בגדרו. אבל מפני כי הוא יתברך פשוט ואין לו גדר כלל, אין דבר\nנבדל ממנו. ואם כן, הוא יודע הכל, והוא יכול הכל, וכל זה מפני שאין לו\nגדר יוגדר בדבר מיוחד, ובשביל זה הכל נמצא מאתו גם כן</p>\n<p>Our sages, of blessed memory, refer to Hashem as \"the Holy One,\nBlessed be He\" and not \"the Intelligent One\", because the truth of His\nbeing is unknown, except that He is separated from all forms of\nsubstance and body that can be found. This is why they call Him \"Holy\nOne Blessed Be He\". The term \"holy\" denotes an entity that is apart\nand removed, and Hashem is simple in the most ultimate sense of\nsimplicity. But precisely because Hashem is the ultimate simplicity\n(abstraction), there is nothing that is excluded from Him.</p>\n<p>When something has a definition, and is distinguished by certain\ncharacteristics, that same definition will exclude form it things that\nare outside of that definition. But because Hashem has no definition\nat all, nothing is excluded from Him. Therefore, He knows everything\nand can do anything. All this is because God is not defined by any\nspecific definitions, therefore, everything comes from Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As to the point that saying something is undefined is defining it, we have already dealt with this in our theology (and this very much is right-brain stuff):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Rebbe Rashab explains that indeed, He is so undefined, that even calling Him \"undefined\" is not correct, because that would be a limit, so the truth is beyond words:</li>\n<li>language itself is inadequate to describe Him, so even calling Him undefined is insufficient, and our understanding of it is completely impossible</li>\n<li>the only reason we can even say this is because of the one thing we can understand about it, like the Maharal said: Hashem's lack of definition means He can be and do and know anything and everything - nothing is excluded. We are given this gift to a small, finite extent: as people, we can be whatever and whoever we want to be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>His problem is that he is stuck with objectivism, which is a form of materialism - all that exists is only what we can see. He demonstrates this in his next point</p>\n<h4>God existing is arbitrary</h4>\n<p>This is also a false witness. Firstly, He is not arbitrary; as we teach in our first law of Mishnah Torah, God is defined as the original reality from which all other reality gets its existence from. This is the exact opposite of arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there are manifold claims of His existence. He may think that all those claims are wrong, but bear in mind nobody is claiming there are goblins on venus.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the idea that rational thinkers shouldn't entertain arbitrary claims, otherwise they are being irrational, is not a good argument. Until something is known, it won't be discovered until someone entertains the possibility of its existence. People who refuse to do that are mostly just doing it out of fear - they don't want to make a mistake and \"be fooled\" or \"look stupid\".</p>\n<p>Fourth, the fact that everything is fixed, has laws, and all the assumptions that go into his objectivist worldview, <em>are also arbitrary</em>! Why should laws not change? Why should the world operate logically? We are thankful it does, but the very fact that we can conceive of \"tohu\", pure chaos, means that order is arbitrary.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is much more to say but it is exhausting. The final answer, the \"forest\", the <strong>tl;dr</strong>, <strong>is that Torah doesn't assume all is composed of finite, concrete, identifiable entities (the basic premise of his worldview), and he does, so we disagree on the basics.</strong> All other arguments are \"trees\" and it is very tiresome wading through them, with people who can't see the forest for the trees.</p>\n<p>If someone is genuinely agnostic, and wants to honestly explore God's existence, and wants to tackle it seriously; philosophically, and theologically, I would recommend Rambam's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed?tab=contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim</a> (english), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gevurot_Hashem%2C_Second_Introduction_to_Gevurot_Hashem?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gevurot Hashem</a> as quoted above by the Maharal (hebrew), and <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4094417/jewish/Mitzvas-Haamanas-Elokus-Publishers-Foreword.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha Haamanut Elokut</a> (english), immediately followed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Mitzvotekha%2C_The_commandment_of_the_unification_of_God?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Achdut Hashem</a> (hebrew as of yet). I would also be happy to make more recommendations if someone wishes to ask in the comments.</p>\n<p>Best is to not engage. Someone who is making an assumption and using it as a logical argument is not worth arguing with - they are either foolish, cynical or outright dishonest. They are very unlikely to hear you and this answer is purely for those who are not stuck in assumptions and wish to learn some Torah theology.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There is evidence for God. Many people have claimed to have interacted with him.</p>\n<p>Even if something cannot be demonstrated true or false, one can still reasonably believe in it due to 1) Occam's Razor or 2) it is comforting/pleasurable to do so.</p>\n<p>You don't appreciate community input because you had to specify that you believe in God. You actually fear community input and will probably crumble emotionally if it calls you a heretic.</p>\n\n\n",

Same view Beis Borukh (25:39), Responsa Betzel haChokhmah (4:115), Kuntres Chikrei Halakhos V'halikhos Shekhenim 29, Responsa Machazeh ELiyahu 122:6 who quotes R' Eliyashiv, same rulling is in Mishna Halakhos (second ed., vol 2, Ch\"M 466).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What happened to Sefer Yechezkel before Chananyah ben Chizkiyah ben Guriyon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a famous Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.13b.8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 13b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב: ברם זכור אותו האיש לטוב וחנניה בן חזקיה שמו, שאלמלא הוא נגנז ספר יחזקאל, שהיו דבריו סותרין דברי תורה. מה עשה? — העלו לו שלש מאות גרבי שמן, וישב בעלייה ודרשן.</p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: Truly, that man is remembered for the good, and his name is Ḥananya ben Ḥizkiya, as if not for him, the book of Ezekiel would have been suppressed because its contents, in many details, contradict matters of Torah. The Sages sought to suppress the book and exclude it from the canon. What did he, Ḥananya ben Ḥizkiya, do? They brought him three hundred jugs of oil, for light and food, up to his upper story, and he sat isolated in the upper story and did not move from there until he homiletically interpreted all of those verses in the book of Ezekiel that seemed contradictory, and resolved the contradictions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, Chananyah ben Chizkiyah ben Guriyon was a Tanna during the time of Beis Shammai/Bais Hillel, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Hillel_and_Shammai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> puts at around the last century BCE/1st century CE. Yechezkel, on the other hand, is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">dated around the 6th century BCE</a>. That leaves a time span of approximately 500 years. What was the status of Sefer Yechezkel during that time? Was it a \"lost\" or \"hidden\" sefer? Was it viewed as a kefirah? And if no one understood it until Chananyah ben Chizkiyah ben Guriyon came along, then why was Yechezkel not put to death for being a navi sheker owing to those contradictions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Yechezkel's undisputed prophetic status and important leadership role in the Judahite community are currently only known from the book itself (i.e., he's not known to be mentioned in other contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous sources), which both states that he was chosen by Hashem to lead the exiles in Babylon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.24.24-27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:24-27</a>), and that on several occasions he taught and prophesied before the elders of Judah and Israel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.8.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.14.1-4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:1-4</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.20.1-3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:1-3</a>).</p>\n<p>As already stated by @Meir in the comments, the book is traditionally thought to have been authored by Anshei Knesset Hagedolah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.15a.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Bava Batra 15b</a>). Some time later, Yechezkel was mentioned by Ben Sira (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%9E%D7%98#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%99%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%94%20%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%94%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%97%D7%96%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">49:8</a>)<sup>1</sup> as one of the great leaders of previous generations that are mentioned in ch. 44-49, a section which is sometimes referred to as \"The Praise of the Previous Generations\" (albeit not all famous Tanachic characters appear there, while on the other hand Shimon Hatzaddik does). In the same verse, Ben Sira also referenced Ma'aseh Merkava. Ben Sira was also a book of debatable status, but was nonetheless continuously quoted, paraphrased and referenced by many sages. A paraphrase of Ben Sira even appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.4.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Avot 4:4</a> as the only known preserved teaching by Rabbi Levitas of Yavneh (see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/A_New_Israeli_Commentary_on_Pirkei_Avot.4.4.13?vhe=Pirke_Avot,_a_New_Israeli_Commentary,_by_Avigdor_Shinan%3B_Jerusalem,_2009&qh=%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A9%20%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>From the little information we have, it seems that Yechezkel was known as an important prophet and his book was considered legitimate and at least somewhat widely disseminated.<sup>2</sup> The debate of the sages was not on either of those. It's important to differentiate between the debatable status of Sefer Yechezkel and the debatable status of Shir Hashirim and Kohelet. In the latter case, the sages were disputed on the question whether touching scrolls of Shir Hashirim and Kohelet would make someone's hand impure (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Yadayim.3.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Yadayim 3:5</a>). The question that lies at the root of this dispute is whether Shir Hashirim and Kohelet are even holy. Not so in the case of Sefer Yechezkel, where it was a given that even if it should not be included in the canon, <strong>it was holy</strong> and must be <em>ganuz</em>, i.e., placed in a genizah, like other holy texts that are taken out of use. The dispute of the sages stemmed from the question of whether it was right to distribute the book to the masses and teach it to them, because it contains some material that may not be understood by all. What Chananyah ben Chizkiyah ben Giron (or Gurion in some versions) did was develop a form of homiletic exegesis for the problematic sections of Yechzekel, which made it easier to teach to the masses. No longer would sages have difficulty in explaining problematic verses as p'shat; they could now rely on Chananyah's explanations and present these verses as drash.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Also in R' Dr. M. Z. Segal's edition of the Hebrew medieval Cairo Genizah manuscript, p. 336, v. 11 (in Hebrew)/v. 8 in secular numeration.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Consider also the existence of Yechezkel manuscripts in Qumran (which some believe were stored in the late 1st century BCE [but of course, like everything in Qumran, this is debatable]), as well as the mysterious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Ezekiel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pseudo-Ezekiel</a>, whose dating is also disputed. And some believe that the Septuagint's translation of Ezekiel should be dated to ca. 150 BCE (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20699920\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p. 117 and sources cited in n. 7).</p>\n\n\n",

Instead they are like the Jerusalem Sephardic tradition, which has a way of generally reading the Psalms that is a flow but isn't that specific.

Seventy Men and Yazniyahu are offering incense there. He is told that he would be shocked if he knew what these men were doing in the dark in their own chambers (see Metzudos Dovid). Then he is informed that he will see \"greater abominations.\"</p>\n<p>He is then taken to the gate of the Heichal (see Metzudos) and shown that inside of the Chamber of the Knives (per Rashi) women are heating an idol from the inside called Tammuz, which has lead eyes, thereby causing the idol to 'weep,' - this means that it wants more sacrifices (see Metzudos and Rashi). Once again, he is told that he will see something worse.</p>\n<p>Why is Tammuz the greater abomination?</p>\n<p>The easy answer is that it's all about proximity (\"where\"). Tammuz was found <strong>deeper within</strong> the Temple complex and thus it is the more egregious crime.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't sound here like proximity alone creates the more egregious crime. And so if Tamuz is worse for independent reasons - Tammuz was perfidious in that it duped others ... The seventy + one men were merely sinning on their own- this begs the question: how did the more shocking crime end up in the more shocking place? Did the women willfully place the more heinous act in a location which expressed more rebelliousness?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Several of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.8.14?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentators on that verse</a> (Abarbanel, Radak, Malbim) state that \"the Tammuz\" here is a form of the Molech worship of child sacrifice.

There was a certain Jewish butcher who said to another individual:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי הוות פייסת מינאי מי לא ספיי לך משור של פטם דעבדי אתמול א\"ל אכלי משופרי שופרי א\"ל מנלך א\"ל דזבן פלוני עובד כוכבים וספא לי א\"ל תרי עבדי וההוא טרפה הוה</p>\n<p>If you would have made peace with me yesterday, wouldn’t I have given you a cut from the fattened bull that I prepared yesterday? The other individual said to him: Nevertheless I ate from the finest of the fine of that bull that you prepared. The butcher said to him: From where did you get a piece? The other said to him: So-and-so the gentile bought it and fed it to me. The butcher said to him: I prepared two bulls yesterday.

And a wind from G-d moved over the surface of the waters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash teaches us that when we read \"four\", it refers to the four galuyos, e.g. Bavel, Paras-Media, Yavan, Edom-Yishmael. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.2.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 2:4)</a> expounds on the posuk in Bereishis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The earth was emptiness” – this is the Babylonian kingdom, as it is stated: “I have seen the land, and behold, it was emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). “And disorder [vavohu]” – this is the Median kingdom, [as it is stated:] “They hastened [vayavhilu] to bring Haman” (Esther 6:14). “And darkness”– this is the Greek kingdom, which darkened Israel’s eyes with their edicts, as they used to say to them: ‘Write on the horn of a bull that you have no portion in the God of Israel.’ “Upon the face of the depths” – this is the evil kingdom [Edom], which cannot be calculated, like the depths; just as the depths cannot be calculated, so is it with [the wickedness of] the wicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash connects the different descriptions of that specific malchus to a word in pesukim elsewhere in the Torah. However, I have trouble understanding why especially these pesukim are chosen when talking about the four galuyos - the four malchuyos.</p>\n<p>The only thing, understandable for me, I found was in the sefer Peninei Ohr (Parshas Bereishis, p. 129), by the Or HaChaim Hakadosh:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The term bohu also hints at the subsequent exile, the Babylonian exile, referred to as bohu because the Aramaic translation of bohu is “emptiness” or “void.” Concerning the Babylonian exile, it is written in Yirmiyahu 51:34, \"Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has devoured me… he has made me an empty vessel.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there any seforim, commentaries of articles that explain why these four descriptions of the state of the world after creating, <em>before G-d created light</em> are being connected to these pesukim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As we learn from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 1:1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 1:4</a>, that the world was created <em>bereishis</em>, in the merit of <em>reishis</em>, i.e. Israel among the nations. Just as the first produce is sacred so is Israel, G-d's sacred nation. Yet, while we are the very purpose for which the world was created, in the next breath the Torah foreshadows the trials and tribulations we must endure throughout our history. The Divine Plan for human destiny is thereby framed at the outset by the verses <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1-2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 1:1-2</a>, from day One to the End of Days.</p>\n<p>The commentary Yefeh To'ar (1), which views the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 1:2</a> as a <em>remez</em> to the 4 kingdoms explains the idea of Creation with the following excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The final point of Creation is the time of <em>moshiyach</em>, when the world gets settles in peace, and be filled with knowledge, and everyone will speak in the name of Hashem. Hashem did not refrain from creating the world as He conceived the idea of 4 kingdoms, despite the fact that multitude of their sinful acts and variants of faith were rebellion to His Honor. Hashem knows the final end, and because of it everything perfomed for our forefathers from the time of their redemption from Egypt and building the Temple - is an afront to His final goal, and so in the end it was all destroyed as if He acted for naught.</p>\n<p>And His answer was that everything was due to the nature of the matter. The completeness of the entire human race was withheld from others for a long time, because the nature of their creation did not accept it from its beginning. For this it took a long time with many tests and trials and rebukes from several prophets and many troubles in bitter and difficult revelations. After that the redeemed (Jewish) people came out clean as pure and refined silver and returned to Hashem with all their heart and with all their soul. Thus, they knew faithfully that there was no truth and rejected all the kinds of deceptions, which only served to turn away people from from Hashem. Yes, they were ashamed and deceived by their deeds and recognized that there was no other remedy but to seek refuge under His wings. Thus, at the end they will come to Hashem in a covenant of peace (as granted to Pinchas) which will never be broken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of four kingdoms can schematically be represented by the 4 letters of the dreidel (theme 58 in (2) and (3), also Bnei Yisaschar) or in the word גֹשְנָה - the place of the first exile in Mitzrayim, where נ - <em>nefesh</em>, ג - <em>guf</em>, ש - <em>sekhel</em>, and ה - <em>hakol</em> or <em>neshamah</em>. Every exile among the nations sought to target the Jewish nation in different ways. <em>Galus Bavel</em> destroyed the First Temple, rendering it impossible for the Jews to perfect their souls (<em>nefesh</em>) through sacrifices (see Vayikra 2:1). The Persian/Median exile threatened our physical existence (<em>guf</em>) because of Haman's plot. The Greeks sought to supplant our knowledge base <em>sekhel</em> with their own, and when they could not win by intellectual superiority, they attempted to suppress the study of Torah. Finally Edom/Rome attacked us in every way (hakol). The Gematria of the word משיח is 358 = ג+נ+ה+ש. Thus the the Messianic king will be able to overcome <em>hakol</em>. Alternatively, the final <em>teshuvah</em> and overcoming of each of the kingdoms would allow the <em>neshamah</em> of the person enlighten his/her <em>guf</em>, <em>nefesh</em> and <em>sekhel</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The midrash connects each of galuyos using similar words.</p>\n<p>The verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.4.23?lang=bi&with=Metzudat%20David&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 4:23</a> describes the prophetic vision of the prophet Yirmiyahu about what was going to happen to Eretz Yisrael as a result of the conquest by Nevukhadnetzar king of Bavel. The army of Bavel would exile the people, destroy the Temple, and make the land <em>empty and desolate</em> (תֹ֖הוּ וָבֹ֑הוּ), same words as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 1:2</a>.\nIn the language of Kabbala, the exile targeted the <em>nefesh</em> of the Jewish people, as being uprooted from their land and subject to an environment of a different country.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.6.14?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 6:14</a> speaks how providentially the Persian king's eunuchs came in the middle of the argument between Haman and Zeresh and <em>hurriedly</em> (וַיַּבְהִ֙לוּ֙, i.e. astonished him) rushed Haman to Esther's banquet. The word וַיַּבְהִ֙לוּ֙ has root בהל - shock, astonish, which is similar to the word ּבֹּהו - astonishingly empty as pointed by Matanos Kehuna.</p>\n<p>To explain the connection pointed by Matnos Kehuna, one can used the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.30.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 30:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for You, O LORD, when You were pleased, made [me] firm as a mighty mountain. When You hid (הִסְתַּ֥רְתָּ) Your face, I was terrified (נִבְהָֽל).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. just like the created אֶרֶץ was called בֹּהוּ in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 1:2</a> because it was void of רוּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים, so is a person who is נִבְהָֽל because s/he experiences the הסתר פנים של השם. In other words, upto the moment of the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.6.14?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 6:14</a> Haman felt empowered while the Jews were נִבְהָֽלִים - astonishingly frightened, as if Hashem was letting Haman do with his conspiracy to destroy Jewish people. At the moment when Haman was called to the banquet, right after Zeresh told him that he had no chance against Mordekhai, the roles changed: Haman realized that the possibility to make his evil plans was an illusion and he was going to face justice. Haman himself became נִבְהָֽל and the Jewish people realized that they have a shot to win the battle!</p>\n<p>To understand the language of Kabbala, Rashi explains, that Harvonah overheard the conversation between Haman and Zeresh, where Haman expressed a wish to convince the king for the second time to hang Mordechai, ... and from here Harvonah knew why Haman ordered building the gallows. As we understand, the gallows is made to destroy the body.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The quote about the Greek Kingdom seems cryptic. For direct answer, one can use <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.2.2.4?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Chagiga 2:2:4</a> stating</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hillel and Menaḥem did not disagree. Menaḥem left and Shammai entered.” Where did he leave to? Some are saying, from behavior he left to behavior. But some are saying, he left against his face, he and eighty pairs of students of the Sages, wearing golden tirqe, whose faces became <strong>black like the rim of a clay pot</strong>, when they were told (by the Greeks), <em>write on a bull’s horn that you have no part in the God of Israel</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact every Jew, who owned an ox was commanded to do so and publicize the heresy. Yefeh To'ar  states that the decree of the Greeks hints to the making of the Golden Calf which distanced us from Hashem. The reason why this answer works, comes from another midrash, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.2.10?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabba 2:10</a>, which talks about different directions symbolized by the camps in the desert. In particular,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>North, from there <strong>darkness</strong> emerges to the world, and corresponding to it, the tribe of Dan. Why? It is because it brought darkness to the world with idol worship. Yerovam crafted two golden calves, and idol worship is darkness, as it is stated: “<strong>Their actions are in the dark (בְמַחְשָׁךְ֙)</strong>” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.29.15?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 29:15</a>). Yerovam circulated throughout Israel and it was only the tribe of Dan that accepted it from him, as it is stated: “The king consulted, and he crafted two golden calves…and he placed one in Dan” (I Kings 12:28–29). That is why the Holy One blessed be He commanded that Dan would encamp in the north. That is what is written: “The banner of the camp of Dan is to the north…” (Numbers 2:25).</em> With it, the tribe of Asher, which illuminates the darkness, as it is stated: “And of Asher he said: Blessed…and he dips his foot in oil” (Deuteronomy 33:24). Likewise it says: “And those who encamp with it, the tribe of Asher” (Numbers 2:27). With it, Naphtali, who is filled with blessing in order to provide sustenance, just as it is written: “Naphtali, his desire is satisfied, [and full with the blessing of the Lord]” (Deuteronomy 33:23). Likewise it says: “and the tribe of Naphtali” (Numbers 2:29). “All those counted for the camp of Dan…they shall travel last by their banners (Numbers 2:31), as anyone who engages in idol worship goes backward and not forward. That is why it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom, established the heavens with understanding”(Proverbs 3:19).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The key point is, the kingdom of Yavan (Greece) was forcing upon Jewish people all different ways of heresy and <strong>avoda zara</strong>, with decrees to reject G-d of Israel, and the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.29.15?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 29:15</a> links <strong>avoda zara</strong> and darkness.</em></p>\n<p>There are also circumstantial indications in other sources. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillat_Ta%27anit%2C_Adar.20?vhe=Warsaw,_1874&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilas Taanis Adar</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בח' בטבת נכתבה התורה יונית בימי תלמי המלך והחושך בא לעולם שלשת ימים.</p>\n<p>On the 8th day of Teves the Torah was translated into Greek language in the days of king <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ptolemy II</a> and <em>darkness (חושך)</em> fell on the world for 3 days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(On the kabbala level, the skin of the ox is used to make the <em>batim</em> for tefilin and parchments for Torah, tefilin, and mezuzos - items that symbolize the foundations of our faith and connection to the Torah. The fact that the Greeks forbade learning of the Torah - was a decree against our <em>sekhel</em>).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Mikvaot.9.2?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mikvaos 9:2</a> also gives the answer which fits the language of the midrash. Among the things which prevent purification in the <em>mikveh</em>, the mishnah mentions טִיט הַיָּוֵן - miry, slimy clay and גֵץ יְוֵנִי - road clay, dirt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is meant by 'miry clay’? This means the clay in pits, for it is written: \"He lifted me out of the miry pit, the slimy clay (מִטִּיט הַיָּוֵן)\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.40.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 40:3</a>)... And \"road-clay.\" These become like road-side pegs in these [kinds of clay] one may not immerse oneself nor immerse [other things] with them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The root of the word יָּוֵן is the same as יון - the Hebrew name for Greece. Just like dirt prevents one to achieve purity, so did the Greek wisdom when applied to the wisdom of the Torah. For example, the Greeks denied that humans had ability to receive divine prophecy and that the laws of the Torah were divinely ordained. Such a view devalues the mitzvos and the Torah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Regarding the kingdom of Edom, Yefeh To'ar gives two answers about the language מַה הַתְּהוֹם הַזֶּה אֵין לוֹ חֵקֶר - <em>just as the depths cannot be calculated</em>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yefeh To'ar states that the evil kingdom of Edom was great and tenthfold mighty (i.e. its power cannot be calculated). The Romans recruited conscripts into their army people from all nations of the world (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.42.4?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 42:4</a>). In the army they would forget their native language and all become Romans so that there would not be distinction between people of the empire. Even with respect to religion, the Romans modified the beliefs of the conquered nations so that their faiths became variants of the single imperial cult. In this respect, the empire was similar to the deep waters, where one cannot see anything and distinguish one thing from another. As every nation has its own good or bad inclinations, the mix creates the confusion when anything of value for <em>neshamah</em> could easily be targeted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, Yefeh To'ar with reference to ha-Arukh the words <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.42.4?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 42:4</a> מַכְתֶּבֶת טִירוֹנְיָא מִכָּל אֻמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם as collecting taxes from all nations meaning such a large sum of money <em>which cannot be calculated</em>.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The second answer of Yefeh Toar is based on Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.54b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 54b</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Sages taught: Seven matters are concealed from people, and they are: The day of death; and the day of consolation from one’s concerns; the profundity of justice, ascertaining the truth in certain disputes; and a person also does not know what is in the heart of another; and a person does not know in what way he will earn a profit; and one does not know when the monarchy of the house of David will be restored to Israel; and <strong>when the wicked Roman monarchy will cease to exist</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is we cannot calculate the ending date of this kingdom.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>One can also adress the words מַה הַתְּהוֹם הַזֶּה אֵין לוֹ חֵקֶר directly with the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.42.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 42:8</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where deep calls to deep (תְּהוֹם־אֶל־תְּה֣וֹם) in the roar of Your cataracts; all Your breakers and billows have swept over me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi here says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Deep calls to deep</strong> One trouble calls the next one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. many troubles, hard to calculate. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.42.8?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak here</a> is even more explicit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The deep</strong>. A hint at the troubles of the exile, which are likened to water, as if the troubles call out to each other: <strong>in the roar of Your cataracts</strong>. That is, my soul is humbled at the roar of your cataracts (conduits), meaning that thus the troubles continue upon us like water pouring from the roof from the conduit and making a sound, and it must be interpreted that the clouds will be called cataracts because they are conduits of rain and everything is a metaphor for the troubles:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>One can even include here the quoted <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Mikvaot.9.2?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Mikvaos 9:2</a> with reference to <em>deep wells</em> filled with muddy water preventing any purification and atonement for the sins. With absense of Beis haMikdash we do not have any prophetic insights to the end of the exile or to the end any of the difficulties that we have to live with and with any account for impurities that we may carry.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>Finally, regarding Moshiyach, the midrash uses <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.11.2?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks about time of moshiyach with completion of the man, as Malbim explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And it rested upon him</strong>, the perfection will be in three things,\na. The perfections that depend on the fact that he has thinking <em>nefesh</em>, with strength, <em>chokhmah</em>, and <em>binah</em>. The <em>chokhmah</em> will be passed by tradition from the rabbis, and <em>binah</em> developing distinctions in matter by means of comparisons.</p>\n<p>b. the perfection of him as a man, which includes the perfection in ability to give advice ('eitzah) and ability of might (<em>g'vurah</em>, i.e. <em>guf</em>). The power of advice as he will contemplate in every matter tenthfold. The power of might will come from completion of his physical development.</p>\n<p>c. The perfections that depends on the fact that he is a holy, noble soul from on high whose elevation is higher than the <em>thinking nefesh</em>, and the perfection of this soul depends on whether he will have the knowledge of God, that is, to know true opinions in the truth of God, His providence and His ways. Such level was achieved by the prophets who communicated these truths in prophecy. And let him have a spirit of fear of God, for knowledge without fear is nothing, and likewise with fear without knowledge one does not know whom he is to fear. According to this, it means that these three perfections will be in the Messiah in completeness, sublime to the point of not being natural, but will relate to the Spirit of God, sublime from nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>*<em>Sources</em></p>\n<p>(1) Commentary Yefeh To'ar on Midrash Bereshis Rabba 2:4 full edition by Zikhron Aharon</p>\n<p>(2) Michoel Miller \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.11.2?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darkness and Destiny: The Four Empires in Midrash and Beyond</a>\" published by גליון in Lakewood, NJ, in 2011 (ph. 732-905-0091, FAX (732) 905-0081).

    "content": "# Is Hashem not obligated to provide for our needs, especially if we have been good?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since Hashem created mankind, is he not obligated to provide for our needs? Parents are obligated to provide for the needs of their children, should we expect any different from Hashem, especially if we have been ritious and pious? Well, not according to Tehillim 16:2 which says;</p>\n<p>\"You should say to the Lord,'You are my Master; my good is not incumbent upon You.</p>\n<p>Rashi explains: \"The benefits that You do for me is not incumbent upon You to bestow [them] upon me, because You do not benefit me on account of my righteousness.</p>\n<p>Can someone please help me understand why this is so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>1: He created the concept of obligation. It’s His decision whether or not that concept should apply to Him.</p>\n<p>2: We have a concept that one’s main reward is in the World to Come. Material benefits do not perfectly correlate to one’s merits. Anything that one receives in this world is only meant as a tool to increase the amount of goodness he can generate, and the ideal tools vary from person to person.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a Tosfos in Berachos (I cannot currently find it), that says מאן דיהיב חיה יהיב מזונה meaning The One who gives life gives food. This is according to the attribute of Justice says Tosfos. Hence we say \"נברך אלקנו\" thanking Hashem (specifically using the name of Hashem that reflects Justice).</p>\n<p>However on the other side the Ramban says in Torah Temimah (100) - I believe he states it in Chumash as well - that Hashem is not obligated to reward us - that is why Avraham trusting Hashem for the reward in this world is not an obvious requirement, because Hashem doesn't need to.</p>\n<p>I think there is a simple resolution:</p>\n<p>When it comes to your personal actions Hashem is not obligated, but because he had created you there should be enough food. Of course there are many functions of this world, and one of them might be to distribute food equitably - like charity. Therefore, yes Hashem makes the world have enough food - but we have a responsibility to help. Only in the wilderness that Hashem specifically led us, was Hashem possibly obligated to help us directly. (See Rav Nechemya Kornitzer on Yisro - that is why Rashi mentions the miracles Elokim (attribute of Justice) did for us is Mana, the well, and saving us from war).</p>\n\n\n",

Or should this be a different month?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Whiston translation of Antiquities <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link14noteref-6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proposes</a> that the fast Josephus referred to may have been the one on the 23rd of Sivan, which was traditionally believed to have originally been established to commemorate the day that King Jeroboam I banned the Kingdom of Israel from bringing tithes from the first fruits (Bikkurim) to the Temple in Jerusalem. This fast is first mentioned in some medieval lists of fasts (collectively known in modern scholarship as \"Megillat Ta'anit Batra\" = The Later Scroll of Fasting) that appear in works such as the Geonic-period book Halachot Gedolot (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20341&st=&pgnum=460&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>) and Rabbi Yinon ben Tzemach's piyyut (<a href=\"https://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx?mishibbur=932001&mm15=001000000001%2000\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>, lines 18-19) from the 12th century CE.</p>\n<p>However, to my knowledge, we don't have traditional sources that tie this fast to Pompey's conquest or that of Herod.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a fast on the 27th of Sivan is also known from various medieval lists, as well as the late antiquity List of Fasts Inscription from the Tel Rehov Synagogue in Israel (discussed by Haggai Misgav <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/15346261/list_of_fasts_from_the_ancient_synagogue_of_Rehov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p. 21). However, here again we have no known connection to Pompey/Herod.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The OP is asking two separate questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The dating of Herod's and Pompei's conquest of Jerusalem according to Josephus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to the article by Andrew Steinmann \"<a href=\"https://rcyoung.org/articles/When_Did_Herod_the_Great_Reign.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">When Did Herod the Great Reign?</a>\", p.8 the quote from Josephus is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . . this destruction befell the city of Jerusalem when Marcus Agrippa and Caninius Gallus were consuls in Rome on the one hundred eighty-fifth Olympiad, on the third month, on the solemnity of the fast,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The comment in the article explains the dating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The consular year and Olympiad given by Josephus indicates that Herod took Jerusalem in 37 BCE. It was the Day of Atonement (\"the fast\") on 10 Tishri in the Jewish calendar, but the third month (September) in the Greek calendar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This opinion is based on Emil Schürer's consensus in <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/history-of-the-jewish-people-in-the-age-of-jesus-christ-volume-1-9781472558275/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The History of Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ</a></em>.  In other words, Josephus is using Greek calendar, and Herod captured Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. If we were to believe that Herod captured Jerusalem exactly 27 years after it fell to Pompei, then we have to accept that Pompei also did it on Yom Kippur. However the dating of Josephus is unreliable, as the quoted article shows.</p>\n<p>At the same time <a href=\"https://www.bialik-publishing.co.il/index.php?dir=site&page=catalog&op=item&cs=571\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yosipon</a> edition of Flusser, chapter 43 The war with Antigonus,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All this came upon Jerusalem, the holy city, in the days of Roman officers Marcus Agrippa and Canidio Gallus (original: Canidius and Gallus) in the year 185 of the Olympiada in the fourth month on the day of fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The comment 269 (<a href=\"https://wsupress.wayne.edu/9780814349441/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English edition</a> comment 19) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The text of Antiquities by Josephus 14.487, has *in the third month of the 185th Olympiad. The author (of Sefer Yosippon) corrects the event to the fast day of <strong>17th of Tammuz</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What could be the actual dating of the Pompei's siege</li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(63_BC)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a>, Pompei's siege of Jerusalem lasted 3 months:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After <strong>three months</strong>, Pompey's troops managed to overthrow one of the Baris towers and were able to enter the Temple precinct, both from the citadel and from the west. First over the wall was a senior officer in Pompey's army named Faustus Cornelius Sulla, the son of former dictator Sulla. Faustus was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, who each led a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews, 12,000 of whom were slaughtered. Only a few Romans troops were killed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and the historical site <a href=\"https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/roman-jewish-wars/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Livius.org</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hyrcanus' followers allowed Pompey to enter the lower town of Jerusalem, but Aristobulus' adherents, the Sadducees, still occupied the Temple. In the west, there was a bridge between the Temple and the city, but this had been destroyed; in the south and east, there were deep valleys. Therefore, Pompey decided to attack from the north. (They only worked on the siege dam on the sabbaths, because the Jews could defend themselves on that days, but were not allowed to attack.) When the siege dam was completed, towers were rolled towards the wall of the Temple. Catapults kept up a continuous pressure by hurling heavy stones; a battering ram broke the wall, and Pompey's soldiers entered the Temple terrace, where they started to kill the defenders. Many Jewish soldiers committed suicide, because they did want to see the profanation of the sanctuary (<strong>June/July 63</strong>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If indeed Pompei captured Jerusalem on a fast day, most likely the fast in the OP's question is the Fast of the 17th of Tammuz or Fast of Sivan 23rd as suggested by Whiston.</p>\n\n\n",

The hakarat hatov was brought by Hashem for 40 years in the desert, and Rabbi Meir Yechiel Halshtok discovered how the 18 minutes correspond to the 20 years of Hashem's time, doubling the reward to 40 years. I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this, where I can find his commentary on it, and also how it was inferred the 18min (מיל) was showing in the pesukim.</p>\n<p>I just realized the Mil is coming from Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Genesis 18:16:1. He demonstrates that the words עַל־פְּנֵ֣י סְדֹ֑ם (מיל), the distance is derived from. Interestingly though he is deriving it differently, by saying that's the distance the angel escorted Lot if I understood correctly. But, now I know where the possible 18 min, comes from of Avraham Escorting, but I still can't find how the 18 minutes can correlate to the 20 years mathematically.</p>\n\n\n",

God wants the brothers to meet, so sends the angel to dislocate Jacob's hip joint, thereby laming him and preventing any possibility of escape.  The lesson is: You may not run away from your troubles.</p>\n<p>-<strong>The Ramban</strong> says that the angel came to warn against antisemites:  The whole matter represents an allusion to our future history, that there would come a time when the descendants of Esau would overcome Jacob almost to the point of total destruction. This happened during the days of the Sages of the Mishnah... There were other generations who did... worse things to us. But we endured all and it passed us by. [Also in Lekach Tov]  The antisemites may wound us, as the entity wounded Jacob's hip, but they will not destroy us.  After that incident, the Torah says: \"וַיָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם עִ֣יר שְׁכֶ֗ם  Jacob arrived whole (shalem) in the city of Shechem\". [Gen. 33:18] The battle will end “at the break of dawn”, which is the time of the final Redemption.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Rabbenu Baḥya</strong> says the angel came to find a sin Jacob was guilty of, to use it as a weapon to overpower him. He did not succeed. The only sin he could find was that Jacob had married two sisters during their lifetime, something the Torah later forbade.  The writing: “He inflicted an injury on Jacob’s hip joint” is a euphemism for his sexual organ and the seat of sexual desire. The punishment was administered near that organ so that Jacob limped for a while.  The Zohar [1:170b] makes a similar point.</p>\n\n\n",

Possibly, because the Pelishtim (Avvim and Kaftorim) had their own lands in Teiman, the Sea Islands, and other Coastal areas, they never had a full claim to Eretz Yisrael. On the other hand, the Canaanim did have such a claim, as Avraham and Yaakov were buying land from them. (<strong>Many thanks to @Yø-cRo for very helpful sources</strong>).</p>\n<p>Regardless, the midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.54.4?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 54:4</a> gives a possible reason, why the tensions between the Jews and Pelishtim arose only beginning with the era of Shoftim, once it became incumbent for the Jews to take over Eretz Israel and why they were able to conquer them only at the time of David:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“Abraham took flocks and cattle, and gave them to Avimelekh, and the two of them established a covenant” (Genesis 21:27).\n“Abraham set aside seven ewes of the flock by themselves” (Genesis 21:28).\n“Avimelekh said to Abraham: What are these seven ewes that you have placed by themselves?” (Genesis 21:29).</strong>\n“Abraham took flocks and cattle, and gave them to Avimelekh…Avimelekh said to Abraham: What are these seven ewes?” – the Holy One blessed be He said to him [Abraham]: ‘You gave seven ewes against My wishes, by your life, I will delay the rejoicing of your descendants for seven generations.’\n‘You gave him seven ewes against My wishes, by your life, they [the Philistines] will correspondingly kill seven righteous men of your descendants.’ They are: Ḥofni and Pinḥas, Samson, and Saul and his three sons.\n‘You gave him seven ewes against My wishes, they [the Philistines] will correspondingly destroy seven Sanctuaries of your descendants.’ These are: The Tent of Meeting, Gilgal, Nov, Givon, Shilo, and the two eternal Temples [in Jerusalem].\n‘You gave him seven ewes against My wishes, My Ark will correspondingly circulate in the Philistine countryside for seven months.’ That is what is written: “He sent His strength into captivity, [and His splendor into the hand of the foe]” (Psalms 78:61) – this refers to the Ark of the Covenant. And it is written: “The Ark of the Lord was in the Philistine countryside seven months” (I Samuel 6:1). “And His splendor into the hand of the foe” – this refers to the priestly vestments, as it says: “You shall make holy vestments for Aaron…and for splendor” (Exodus 28:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, the added words in brackets [the Philistines] implies that the Philistines cooperated with Assyria, Bavel, and other invaders against Jewish people. In particular, an earlier midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.54.2?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 54:2</a> explains the point about <em>derekh Eretz Pelishtim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: It is written: “My enemies are mighty with life” (Psalms 38:20). What was granted to Abraham after seven generations was granted to Avimelekh after three. Why? “God did not guide them via the land of the Philistines” (Exodus 13:17), because his [Avimelekh’s] grandson was still alive [at that time]. (Moses was the seventh generation from Abraham, and he was not allowed to conquer the lands of the Philistines because Avimelekh’s third-generation descendant was still alive then. This shows the extraordinary longevity of Avimelekh’s line.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, the Magen Avraham is an Acharon, it is worthwhile to trace his quoted sources to their origin and consider if that is their unambiguous meaning. Also, tracing sources allows us to draw influences about the situations / extent in which this might be acceptable.</p>\n<p>This is particularly so given that this approach threatens to undermine the integrity of the masora. If any of my rabbis feel they can attribute their own thoughts to others, and that this lying is ethical, how do I know that they are not lying to me about <strong>anything</strong> that <strong>anyone</strong> said? Maybe the entire Mishnayot is made up, and none of those Tannaim said anything. Maybe the Magen Avraham never said this, and some printer decided this was a good idea on his own and then attributed it to the Magen Avraham!</p>\n<p>To quote myself, in an article (<a href=\"https://jewishlink.news/rabbi-yossi-prevails-bava-kamma-24a/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yossi prevails</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Eruvin 51a, third-generation Pumbeditan Amoraim, Rabba and Rav Yosef, were traveling before Shabbat, and wouldn’t arrive in the town in time. However, one can designate a Shabbat residence in a different location and thereby gain 2000 cubits of travel in each direction. One could travel 2000 cubits to that location and another 2000 cubits into the town. Rabba said “our residence will be under that palm tree which has another palm tree leaning on it. Rav Yosef said he did not know it. Rabba said: Rely on me, since there is a brayta in which Rabbi Yossi says that such a setup works, citing the brayta. The Talmudic Narrator continues with an astonishing comment, that it was not so – Rabbi Yossi didn’t actually say this. It was Rabba’s own position, but he falsely attributed it to Rabbi Yossi’s position, so that Rav Yosef would accept it from him, because רַבִּי יוֹסֵי נִימּוּקוֹ עִמּוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"problem\" with this suggestion that Rabbi Yossi didn't actually say it is that we have a Tosefta (much earlier authorship) in which Rabbi Yossi actually does say it. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Eruvin.3.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Eruvin 3:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האומר שביתתי בצד אילן בצד חרוב בצד גנה לא אמר כלום עד שיקנה לצפונו או לדרומו ד' אמות [קנה לצפון או לדרום] ד\"א [נעקר] האילן [נעקר] החרוב [נעקר] הגנה אם מכיר את מקומו ה\"ז מותר ואם לאו [ה\"ז] אסור ר' יוסי אומר היו שנים א' מכיר וא' שאינו מכיר [הואיל וא' מהן מכיר שניהן מותרין].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, quoting myself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the Rabba - Rav Yosef incident, Tosefta Eruvin 3:13 has exactly this position for Rabbi Yossi about two travelers where only one knows the spot. There is scholarship that the Talmudic Narrator was unfamiliar with the Tosefta, so this could be another instance. Rabba didn’t make up a source or citation, but the Talmudic Narrator suggested that he did. (Indeed, I suspect this is a play on סְמוֹךְ עֲלַי, rely on me, both in a tree-knowing and halachic sense. The brayta with Rabbi Yossi may have been an earlier Stammaic stratum, explaining why Rabba said סְמוֹךְ עֲלַי, rather than Rabba’s own words, and the later Stamma took this as Rabba saying “depend on me because of the following brayta”.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about the other prooftext, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.112a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 112</a>? Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai prevailed upon the imprisoned Rabbi Akiva to teach him Torah, and one of the teachings was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִם בִּקַּשְׁתָּ לֵיחָנֵק — הִיתָּלֵה בְּאִילָן גָּדוֹל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if you wish to strangle yourself, hang yourself on a tall tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which Rav Natronai Gaon apparently says means to falsely attribute your own words. Rashi in Pesachim says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם בקשת ליחנק היתלה באילן גדול - לומר דבר שישמע לבריות ויקבלו ממך ומשום דנקט לישנא דחניקה נקט היתלה באילן למוד בפני רב ואמור שמועותיו משמו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>If you wish to strangle yourself, hang yourself on a tall tree</strong>: [if you wish] to say something which is well received by people and they will accept it from you ... \"hang yourself\" -- learn before a <em>rav</em> and say his{1} teachings in his{2} name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that Rashi explains this as saying שמועותיו, <strong>his</strong> teaching, משמו, in his name. He does not write שמועותיך, your own teachings in his name.</p>\n<p>Again, quoting myself, even though I am not hanging myself on Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This need not mean fabrication. I’ve done the same in the following sense: if I want to say a big and controversial, e.g. that kezayit is actually much smaller than what kashrut organizations send out on charts, I might search for where Rav Herschel Schachter says such a thing, and then quote3. I’m not fabricating Rav Schachter’s comment, but bothering to search for it and cite it, since people won’t listen to Josh (bar Abba).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Let me know if you understand differently from the Chida:<br />\n<br />\n<em>I.e. if a <strong>woman</strong> senses injustice occuring to her</em> penimiut <em>(her, her children, her loved ones), she is predisposed to be outraged on such a primal level - she takes it so personally - that she might lose her objectivity and overreact, in general.

I would say it's a cultural meme and therefore quite well known and accepted that men find rejection harder tham women do, and this is because when a man tries to give, it's personal and therefore his giving being rejected causes a deep inner pain. It is also pretty well known that men find it harder to say no than women (giving is all about 'yes'), at least in some contexts. Therefore, carer roles where it's important to have an objectivity in giving, and being able to establish boundaries, are best left to women.</em></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To further back up this latter point, I found what could very well be the fuller explanation of the Chida's point.

And in every place that we would not find both male and female, the letter ה will not be found, and therefore there remains only letter ד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Rivka was 14 and over the age of 12 can be learned from the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/145128/36610\">analysis of the Midrash Seder Olam Oriental manuscripts although European manuscripts state that she was 3</a>. In other words, Zohar hints that Rivka did not develop fully and could not have children.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Finally, to address the point in parashas Ki Teitze, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Shai_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.22.19.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 22:19</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ונתנו לאבי הנערה</strong>. לית מלא בתורה והכי נמי אמרינן בכתובות פרק ג' ופרק ד' אמר ר\"ל המוציא שם רע על הקטנה פטור שנאמר ונתנו לאבי הנערה נערה מלא דבר הכתוב וכו' ולפיכך יש לתמוה על הרמב\"ם ז\"ל והקרית ספר דבריש פרק ג' מהלכות נערה בתולה כתבו ואינו חייב עד שיוציא על הנערה שנאמ' והוציאו את בתולי הנערה נערה מלא דבר הכתוב וגם הסמ\"ג בעשין נ\"ה כתב כן וזה שלא בדקדוק וכבר העיר בזה הכסף משנה. ונתעוררו חז\"ל בספר הזוהר על מה שכתוב בכל הפרשה נער חסר ה\"א והטעם כי הה\"א רומזת לה\"א אחרונה של שם והיא חסרה מן הנערה הזאת אך ונתנו לאבי הנערה מלא כי היא בשלימותה וזהו כי הוציא שם רע על בתולת ישראל ורמז לכנסת ישראל של מעלה. תבין מכאן עונש המוציא שם רע עד היכן מגיע קלקולו. ריקנאטי ועיין עוד בזוהר דפוס קרימונה פרשת בראשית עמוד ס\"ז:</p>\n<p>It should not be complete in the Torah, and so it is said in Gemara Kesubos perek 3 and 4, for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.40b.12?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 40b</a></p>\n<p>Reish Lakish said: One who slanders a minor girl, falsely claiming that she was not a virgin on the wedding night, is exempt from paying the fine, as it is stated: “And they shall give them to the father of the young woman [נַעֲרָה]” (Deuteronomy 22:19). The verse spoke of נַעֲרָה, not only pronounced but written in full, indicating that this payment is in effect only with regard to a young woman, not a minor girl. However, in places where the term is written נַעֲרָ, even a minor girl would be included.</p>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>one can wonder on the words</strong> of Rambam and Kiryas Sefer, an in the beginning perek 3, hilkhos Virgin Maiden (Naarah Besula) where they wrote:</p>\n<p>He is not liable unless he issues a slanderous report regarding a na'arah. <strong>(1)</strong>(2) [This is derived from Deuteronomy 22:15]: \"[They will] present signs of the maiden's virginity.\" The word נערה, \"maiden\" is written in a full form. (3)(4)</p>\n<p>And also SM\"G B'Osin 55 wrote so, which is not according to grammar. And already Kesef Mishneh arose awareness about it. And in Sefer haZohar they aroused attention when in the entire parasha used נַעֲרָ (without ה) and the reason  that the letter hei (ה) hints to the final ה of the name and it is lacking from this (particular) maiden. However, in this case <strong>ונתנו לאבי הנערה</strong> it is spelled with hei (ה) because she is a mature virgin (b'sheleimusa), and that is why a man who slanders a virgin of Israel, hints to the congregarion of Israel of the above. One should understand from here the punishment of the slanderer, and how far the damage that he inflicts goes. (Rekanati and also look in Zohar, Dfus Kadmon (Old Edition?), section Bereshis Amud 67).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the way, if one stares into the words of Zohar for a long time, one finds why Yehudah spelled with hei has good children with Tamar spelled without hei, and one should not worry about Yosef and Osnath, for ת at the end is also feminine like hei. Also Sarai did not have hei and with her husband Avram they lacked ability to have children, which explains the name their name change to Avraham and Sarah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) <strong>As mentioned previously, the term na'arah implies a specific time frame: the six months after a girl's manifestation of physical signs of maturity once she has reached the age of twelve.</strong></p>\n<p>(2) As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 1, Halachah 8, the word na'arah, \"maiden\" is sometimes used by the Torah to refer to girls between the ages of three and twelve and a half. In this instance, however, the meaning of the term is specific.</p>\n<p>(3) Generally, the word נערה, maiden, is written in the Torah without the final heh. The inclusion of the heh is obviously purposeful and intended to teach a concept.</p>\n<p>(4) The Rambam's statements have aroused the attention of the commentaries, for in our Torah scrolls the word נערה in the verse cited by the Rambam lacks a heh. The Kessef Mishneh (based on Ketubot 40b and Rashi, 44b) notes that the Talmud derives this concept from Deuteronomy 22:19: \"And he shall give it to the father of the maiden.\" In that verse, the word נערה is written with a heh in our Torah scrolls.</p>\n\n\n",

Really, it's prohibited; but today's rabbis gave up on saying \"no\" because people will do it anyhow.</p>\n<p>2.) Very few people do proper instrument repairs today. So \"if we allow clapping and dancing, people will start playing instruments, and then do proper repairs on them\" is exceedingly unlikely. So \"everything\" -- i.e. dancing/clapping -- is actually permitted today, unlike the above answer.</p>\n<p>Let's assume in the times of the Mishna, the probability of going from clapping/dancing to using musical instruments was A, and from using them to fixing them (in a truly Biblical way) was B. Both A and B are numbers somewhere between 0 and 1. A x B yields a probability that's still plausible, so the Sages prohibited.</p>\n<p>The Ramah says that today, the probability of going from using instruments to fixing-them-in-a-Biblical-craftsman way is now C, which is less than B. And A x C = something so negligible as to not be subject to a rabbinic enactment.</p>\n<p>Just because A x C = negligible, does not mean that C alone is negligible. If you start clapping/dancing, you have A x C; but once you start using instruments, you have C alone, which is greater than A x C, and therefore prohibited.</p>\n<p>Please.

Elimelekh responded that it was very difficult for him, to which King David responded \"at least drink a cup of tea\" and when R. Elimelekh drank the tea with sugar then King David would appear to him with a crown on his head, and when he drank it without sugar he would appear to him without a crown.

Clearly, Abraham was accustomed to stand in prayer in the morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer (mincha)</strong>, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to converse [lasuaḥ] in the field toward evening” (Genesis 24:63), and conversation means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “A prayer of the afflicted when he is faint and pours out his complaint [siḥo] before the Lord” (Psalms 102:1). Obviously, Isaac was the first to pray as evening approached, at the time of the afternoon prayer.</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob instituted the evening prayer</strong> (maariv/arvit), as it is stated: “And he encountered [vayifga] the place and he slept there for the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). The word encounter means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated when God spoke to Jeremiah: “And you, do not pray on behalf of this nation and do not raise on their behalf song and prayer, and do not encounter [tifga] Me for I do not hear you” (Jeremiah 7:16). Jacob prayed during the evening, after the sun had set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the question is essentially similar to the question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9624/who-instituted-the-musaf-prayer\">Who instituted the Musaf prayer?</a>\", I am asking for a source in חז\"ל, <em>not commentary</em>.

He had also planted 70 date-palms corresponding to the seventy elders of the Jewish people. The meaning of this Midrash is that after the crossing of the Sea of Reeds the Israelites had not encountered such a good camping place as this one at Eylim. Just as they had experienced a miracle at the sea when G’d sweetened the salt-water of the sea so that they could drink from it while crossing, and He provided 12 lanes for the different tribes to cross in, so this type of miracle was re-enacted at Eylim. Its waters were sweet and flowing; there were 12 separate springs so that each tribe could have its own water supply. The seventy date-palms corresponded to the seventy elders each of whom was accorded honour in his own right.</p>\n<p>וע\"ד הקבלה ויבאו אילמה ושם י\"ב עינות מים ושבעים תמרים בבאם עתה במקום הזה באלים נכנסו באותה השגה הנקראת אלהים וזהו לשון ויבאו אילמה ושם שתים עשרה עינות מים כי השיגו שם י\"ב מלאכים שלשה לכל רוח מד' רוחות העולם וכל שלשה מהם עם צבאותיהם מחנה גדול והם הנקראים ד' מחנות שכינה, ושבעים תמרים הם ע' מלאכים הסובבים כסא הכבוד וממונים על ע' אומות שבעולם כל אחד ואחד ממונה על אומתו, וכן תמצא בספר הבהיר ומאי ושם י\"ב עינות מים הקב\"ה נתנם להם בתחלה עינות מים אח\"כ החזירם להם אבנים, דכתיב (יהושע צ ט) ושתים עשרה אבנים, מה טעם מפני שבתחלה היתה התורה בעולם נמשלת למים ואח\"כ נקבעה במקום קבוע מה שאין המים עושים כן שהיום כאן ומחר כאן. ומה שבעים תמרים מלמד ששבעים קומות יש להקב\"ה ושואבים מי\"ב פשוטות, מה המים הללו פשוטים אף הם פשוטים, ומנא לן דתמר הוי קומה דכתיב (שיר ז) זאת קומתך דמתה לתמר ולא עוד אלא בתמרים יש שבעים מינים דכתיב ושבעים תמרים ולא היו דומים זה לזה ופעולות זה אינו דומה לזה וטעם זה אינו דומה לזה ע\"כ, ולפי שכל אחד ואחד פועל מנויו כמו שנתמנה עליו ואיננו רשאי ליכנס לגבול חברו ולכך אמר אינם דומין זה לזה ולא פעולתו של זה דומה לפעולתו של זה, ונרמז לך בזה כי מי\"ב עינות אלה שהם ד' מחנות שכינה שואבים בה שבעים תמרים הם המלאכים הסובבים כסא הכבוד המשילום בתמרים על שם הקומה, והנה דוגמתם יצאו מיעקב י\"ב שבטים הנחלקים לד' מחנות ומהם היו שבעים נפש, והבן זה המעט ותמצא מעלת יעקב שנקרא אל, כענין שכתוב (בראשית לג) ויקרא לו אל אלהי ישראל, ודרשו רז\"ל מי קראו אל אלהי ישראל, ותדע ותשתכל כל עניני האבות ומצות התורה הכל ציורים ודוגמא למצוא ולדעת דעת קדושים.</p>\n<p>A kabbalistic approach: the words “they came to Eylim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date-palms“ mean that when the Israelites now arrived at this site they attained a certain spiritual level called “elohim” (play on the word אלימה with the letters re-arranged). The 12 fountains are a simile for 12 angels, three from each of the four directions. Each group of three angels was accompanied by an army of minor angels so that between them all they represented the מחנה שכינה, the camp of the Divine presence supported at four corners with its celestial entourage.</p>\n<p><strong>The seventy date-palms represent the seventy angels who surround the throne of G’d’s glory and who are assigned, one each, as the celestial representatives of the 70 nations of the world.</strong> You find this confirmed in the Sefer Habahir items 165-7. The author there asks: “what was the significance of the twelve fountains? First G’d gave the Israelites 12 fountains. These were exchanged later when the Jewish people crossed the Jordan into the twelve stones Joshua erected there (Joshua 4,9). The reason is that originally the Torah was likened to life-giving water seeing the Torah, i.e. its bearers were on the move, just like the waters issuing from fountains are on the move, their waters constantly flowing. Once the Israelites crossed the Jordan and began to conquer the Holy Land Torah found a permanent home, was stationary.</p>\n<p>As far as the 70 date-palms are concerned, this is a symbol for seventy different קומות, conduits, by means of which G’d dispenses His largess. These draw their input from twelve of the “simple” letters in the alpha-bet. Just as these waters are ordinary waters (of terrestrial origin), so the seventy nations are essentially terrestrial in nature. Whence do we know that a date-palm may be equated with a קומה? We base this on Song of Songs 7,8 זאת קומתך דמתה לתמר, “such is your stature, likened to a towering palm tree.” Not only that but there are 70 different species of palm trees; this is meant by our verse speaking about seventy palm trees. The words ושבעים תמרים mean that each one was different from the other and the fruit they produced were different from one another, each tasting differently. So far Sefer Habahir. [Levush Orah by R' Mordechai Jaffe, in his super-commentary on Rashi, and Menachem Rekanati explain many of these concepts in greater depth. Ed.] It is important to remember that each date-palm had been assigned its task in nature and each had to contribute according to its specific task. It was not in order for them to be grafted one to another to produce new mutations. <strong>The entire phenomenon is reminiscent of Yaakov and his twelve sons and the seventy descendants who arrived in Egypt.</strong> They were likened to towering palm trees due to their spiritual stature. At the same time they drew their inspiration from Yaakov’s twelve sons who in turn drew theirs from their patriarch-father. The 12 tribes were divided into four camps of three tribes each, encamped in the four directions of the globe enclosing (protecting) the encampment of the Shechinah. This made them carriers of the Divine Presence, Shechinah. This is all reflected in the fact that the patriarch Yaakov himself was called א-ל אלו-הי ישראל, (Genesis 33,20) which line is explained in Megillah 18 as “who called him א-ל? None other than the אלו-הי ישראל, the G’d of Israel.” All of the foregoing only serves the purpose of giving us an inkling of the spiritual stature of our patriarchs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the source of all this is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir.167?vhe=Torat_Emet_Sefer_HaBahir&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer haBahir 167</a>. Rabbeinu Bachya's translation covers well paragraphs 165-6 but the statement in 167 is like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמרת שבעים תמרים שבעים קומות, והא אמרת שבעים ושתים, אלא שבעים ואחת הם וישראל שבעים ושתים אך אינם בכלל, והא אמרת שבעים, אלא האחד שר השטן:</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0877286183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Translation by R' Aryeh Kaplan</a>) You said that seventy date palms represent the seventy Structures. But have you not said that there are 72? There are 71. Israel makes 72, but it is not included. But did you not say there were seventy? One is the Officer of Satan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Afterwards there is a <em>mashal</em> about Satan, which is not related to the question.</p>\n<p>Thus the connection is learned from the lofty status that Israel achieved by travelling to Eylim. This lofty status modeled the Throne of Glory of HKBH, where the 70 ministering angels represent the 70 nations of the world. The 70 palms, which hinted to those angels, in the camp of Israel made correspondence to the 70 elders of Jewish people, who in turn were representative of the 70 souls that descended to Egypt.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, This is a general paradigm that G-d established at the beginning of Creation.</p>\n<p>In the creation of the Hebrew Aleph-Beit, the 22 letters, there are 3 general categories, 3 Amot (אמות which are אמ׳ש, which establish <em>right</em> ימין, <em>left</em> שמאל and <em>center</em> אמצע, as well as <em>beginning</em> ראש, <em>end</em> סוף and <em>between</em> תוך), 7 Kefulot (כפולות meaning doubling letters), and 12 Peshutot (פשוטות which are הוזחטילמנסע׳ק) which correspond to the major constellations and the dimension of time, like the 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night.</p>\n<p>This follows the tradition which <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14434&pgnum=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the patriarch Avraham received from Adam HaRishon (<em>who received it from the Angel, Raziel</em>) and his descendants and is recorded in Sefer Yetzirah</a>.</p>\n<p>The seven doubling letters (בג׳ד-כפר׳ת) establish the doubling relationship on what is described as the side of Holiness and its opposite.</p>\n<p>The 70 souls of Israel are the side of Holiness and are the parallel to the 70 nations (who are actually manifestations of the 70 Ministering Angels who are their spiritual source.)</p>\n<p>If you would like two excellent early sources that discuss this about the letters and the paradigm, see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11591&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Ma'arechet HaElokut</a> and <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30809&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Ginat Egoz, section 2</a>, by Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, who was a student of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Was Suffering Necessary?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>G-D wished to bestow good, and so created our perception of reality. This can be found in many sources such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16133/what-is-the-proof-that-hashems-purpose-in-creation-was-to-bestow-good\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.145.9?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.13.8?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, Eitz Chaim Chapter 1 -- among others.</p>\n<p>G-D could have created what we perceive in any way He wished. Therefore all that we perceive was a requirement/intention of our created reality. While what we perceive can take many forms, one form is one of suffering. We perceive that another experiences something that we cannot quite describe other than \"pain\" or something of the sort. Some may argue the morality of this. It can be argued, for example, that suffering is required to elevate oneself in some way to a higher being. Others may enjoy it on some level. However, if given the option, not influenced by all the suffering experienced until this point, that it would be better (for them or someone else) that suffering should not have been created and is not \"good\".</p>\n<p>The <strong>original</strong> cause of this suffering is not revealed to most of us. However it is noted that others (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_in_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Navi/Prophet</a>) have been revealed the reason behind the need for suffering in some situations.\nRegardless of the reason behind our perception of - or our perception of someone else's - suffering, this was an intentional creation by a Creator who wishes to bestow Good.</p>\n<p>Now, if all creations would agree suffering should have not been created, and it was created nonetheless, there is of course a purpose for this. Indeed, the closest documented person to G-D - Moshe Rabbeinu - could not perceive why this is so.</p>\n<p>However, I am wondering if there is anyone with some insight on my question:</p>\n<p>Why was Suffering required as a potential by-product for a <strong>limitless</strong> Creator to bestow Good?</p>\n<p>Note: @Rabbi Kaii did a good job explaining why suffering is necessary, but from the viewpoint of what <em>we</em> perceive. In other words, we perceive suffering and everything else, and have deduced a purpose for the suffering we perceive. But the question is about it's need/purpose from the viewpoint of it's Creator -- which I realize could very well be unanswerable. A limitless \"Good\" G-D, in my small view, had no absolute <em>need</em> to require Man to suffer to receive His Goodness. Again, just looking for insights on this hard problem of mine.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are actually many attempts to answer this in tradition. I was learning something related to it last night, which is part of a larger body of thought on this question, so I am happy to attempt an answer bringing it all together, although it's clear that this is one of the deepest and most difficult questions in all of Torah thought; I don't expect to satisfy everyone, but for what it's worth:</p>\n<h4>Bread of Shame<sup>1</sup></h4>\n<p>There is a concept of נהמא דכסופא, which is that if Hashem were to give us good without us earning it, it would not be a perfect good. This is a fundamental issue. I've heard two reasons about why it is fundamental.</p>\n<p>The first is from Ramchal<sup>2</sup>, which is that the perfect good is Hashem Himself, and therefore in order to receive that good, we must be similar to Him (more on this in the next point), and just as His goodness belongs to Him, ours must belong to us (and for a finite being, that is achieved through effort - the root of suffering).</p>\n<p>The second goes into the idea that unearned goodness is arbitrary, and arbitrariness is not what Hashem wants. Indeed, arbitrariness is not Godly at all, it is associated with <em>tohu</em>, Amalek, and a cold cruel world where nothing matters. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135459/31534\">this answer</a> which tries to give a fuller explanation. For Chesed (kindness) to be full-blown <em>love</em>, it must be personal, meaningful. Let that sink in.</p>\n<h4>Giving vs. Receiving</h4>\n<p>The Baal Hasulam<sup>3</sup> exquisitely explains this idea of Hashem's desire to give. In order for there to be someone who can receive His goodness, they have to be fundamentally different to Him in one respect: they have to have a desire to receive. Therefore, He had to create that from nothing (<em>yesh me'ayin</em>). This creates a catch 22 - the desire to receive makes us so fundamentally different to Him, that it gets in the way of our receiving of His goodness (which, as we said, is Him, Himself). Therefore, He gives us an opportunity to transform this desire to receive into a desire to give (specifically, a desire to recieve <em>in order to give</em>), through effort, so that it is ours.</p>\n<h4>It's our fault</h4>\n<p>So far, we've discussed why there is suffering, but we haven't quite covered where evil comes from. The Rebbe Rashab<sup>4</sup> explains what <em>da'at</em> really is. It has two elements that are relevant; one is that it is the source of (physical) sensation, and two it is the source of depth of intellect. He then explains love as follows: there is a hidden love (<em>chasadim mechasim</em>), and a revealed love (<em>chasadim megulim</em>).</p>\n<p>Adam didn't want hidden love, he wanted to feel it and thus ate the fruit that gives him <em>da'at</em>, and that was the problem. Once love becomes a sensation that one feels, that's where it's possible to love the wrong thing, and that's the root of all evil, and therefore the big job of mankind begins in refining the human spirit to ensure that only love of Hashem can exist in our hearts. This is a very difficult process of <em>birur</em>, clarification, because of the other issue with <em>da'at</em>; its intellectual depth. Intellectual depth is what enables mixture of good and evil, because someone with that depth of intellect can mix and marry opposites, and paradoxes. Deep stuff!</p>\n<h4>The <em>Yetzer Hara</em> is necessary</h4>\n<p>The Zohar<sup>5</sup> literally says that Hashem needs the <em>Yetzer Hara</em>. As the Tzaddikim point out for us, this is because without the <em>Yetzer Hara</em>, the <em>Neshama</em> (<em>Nefesh Elokit</em>) would not want to be on earth, where it is possible to sin. The <em>Yetzer Hara</em> is like a trap for the <em>Neshama</em>, because it forces the <em>Neshama</em> to enjoy the world, and indeed we receive the <em>Yetzer Hara</em> as children and who is more excited about life than them? However, this of course leads to the possibility of evil, which must be fixed. Our fixing of our <em>Yetzer Hara</em> is indeed the effort, and thus the earning, mentioned previously. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/146186/31534\">this answer</a> for a bit more on this point, and sources there.</p>\n<h4>Hashem has a Ta'avah</h4>\n<p>This is the final point that ties everything together. We are taught that Hashem Himself has a desire, and that desire is to have a dwelling in the very lowest world; this world of physicality<sup>6</sup>. Hence, we are not (just) doing it for ourselves<sup>7</sup>, we are quite literally doing Him a service in all this. Therefore, this is quite literally, as fundamental as it gets: this is the fulfilment of Hashem's Essential Will<sup>8</sup>. Through much Torah study, especially Chassidus, one comes to appreciate this point, and see how it fits into the grand picture. I.e. we come to see what Hashem sees (<em>l'havdil</em>; in our own way) in this project, and realise it is a fantastic, perfect project, and all questions fall away. This takes a life time of study!</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, please feel free to ask for clarification of any of the above points, especially after you have learned the sources provided</strong>. It's clear that even this relatively \"long\" answer is inadequate to fully explain these points, so should be treated merely has \"subject headers\" for the thoughtful to contemplate and further research.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>There are many reasons why Hashem made the world the way that He did, and they are all rather fundamental (and they are all deeply connected). Nonetheless, we must ultimately take on faith that Hashem knows what He is doing. As the Radzyner Rebbe writes<sup>9</sup>, indeed Hashem is truly unlimited, and even though these ideas, in our paradigm, are fundamental, we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that Hashem is limited by them. He creates the paradigm from nothing. So, we have to take it on faith that Hashem's purposes are perfect, even if they create very difficult questions, like the one you have asked. Hashem knows what He is doing, and it's our job to serve Him exactly as He told us, and we know that the reward will be the best possible - eternal <em>d'vekut</em> with Him, Himself, for all eternity<sup>10</sup>. The best possible good!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

But it must be emphasized that, unlike other religions, Judaism does not welcome suffering per se, does not view it as positive, regardless of what comes after it.  The Talmud records three variations of this conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba fell ill. [Rabbi Yoḥanan went] to visit him, and said to him: “Is your suffering dear to you?” Rabbi Ḥiyya said to him: “I welcome neither this suffering nor its reward.”  [Berakhot 5b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words: I don’t want the suffering even if there is a reward that will come after it.  The story continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: “Give me your hand.” Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba [did so and Rabbi Yoḥanan] restored him to health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, before applying faith healing, Rabbi Yoḥanan had to make sure the patient wanted to recover!  If not, faith healing will not work.  He did not assume the desire for recovery was automatic.</p>\n\n\n",

Since it cannot be determined who died first, <strong>Beit Shammai say: They divide the property between them so that the father’s heirs receive half of his property and the son’s creditors receive the other half. And Beit Hillel say: The property retains its previous ownership status.</strong> Since the last known owner of the property was the father, the property is given to the father’s heirs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that it is the opinion of Beit Shammai.</p>\n<p>Usually, the Gmara does not tolerate that a Tana (and I would say especially a \"late\" one) would hold and opinion of Beit Shammai, and will try to make him say \"they did not discuss this point, but this one\" \"...לא נחלקו על ... על מה נחלקו\".</p>\n<p>But I did not find that for this case!</p>\n<p>Does Somekhos, Rabbi Meir's student, really hold like Beit Shammai?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Bava_Batra.2a.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos Baba Basra 2a</a> who explains that everyone agrees to the rule of ממון המוטל בספק חולקין when there is no one מוחזק. Both the standard argument between סומכוס and the חכמים, as well בית שמאי ans בית הלל, is when is someone considered מוחזק enough not to say the rule of ממון המוטל בספק חולקין. Hence, the case of בית שמאי is a different case, and סומכוס may acknowledge that the inheritors are מוחזק.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Punishment for false testimony favoring the accused\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the Ten Commandments is: \"Don't give false testimony\".  This is generally understood as falsely testifying the accused is guilty, when he is innocent.  One penalty is that the false witness, if caught, is given the same penalty the accused would have gotten had he been found guilty.</p>\n<p>But what if the false witness says the accused is innocent, when he knows he is guilty?  If the false witness is caught, what penalty is applied to him?</p>\n<p>We read in Bava Kamma 55b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught that Rabbi Yehoshua said: [One] is exempt from liability according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven [if he] hires false witnesses to testify.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But here the witness is not hired.  He spontaneously decided to help the accused.  (You can think of many possible reasons.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the Ten Commandments is: \"Don't give false testimony\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That would be true whether someone is falsely testifying  someone is guilty or innocent. The issue is false testimony.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The penalty is that the false witness, if caught, is given the same penalty the accused would have gotten had he been found guilty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not always. This is limited to  the case of Eidim Zommim where two witnesses testify that original witnesses were not at the scene of the crime because they were with us elsewhere.  Usually they are  given the punishment they wanted the person who they falsely testifying to receive. In a case where that is not possible for technical reasons they would receive malkos (lashes). The situation mentioned in the OP is also one where the one giving false testimony is given lashes. The Rambam Hilchos Edus 20:9   כָּךְ קִבְּלוּ חֲכָמִים שֶׁשְּׁנַיִם שֶׁהִרְשִׁיעוּ אֶת הַצַּדִּיק וְהִצְדִּיקוּ אֶת הָרָשָׁע בְּעֵדוּתָן. וּבָאוּ עֵדִים אֲחֵרִים וֶהֱזִימוּם וְהִצְדִּיקוּ אֶת הַצַּדִּיק וְהִרְשִׁיעוּ אֶת הָרָשָׁע. הֲרֵי עֵדִים הָרִאשׁוֹנִים לוֹקִים אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁלֹּא הִרְשִׁיעוּ הַצַּדִּיק לְהַלְקוֹתוֹ. <em>our Sages received the following tradition: When two people cause an innocent person to be condemned or <strong>a guilty person to be vindicated through their testimony</strong> and two others come and disqualify their testimony through hazamah vindicating the innocent person and condemning the guilty, the first pair of witnesses receive lashes</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught that Rabbi Yehoshua said: [One] is exempt from liability according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven [if he] hires false witnesses to testify.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a slightly different concept. As Rashi on that Gemora explains, Geroma b'nizekin potur. (very roughly) meaning that  as long as someone can claim in Beis Din that \"I did not do that \" even though he will be punished in the next world for his involvement, human courts (beis din) usually will not punish him for it.   Reason being that you can always blame other people for causing things to happen, the people who took the money to testify falsely  weren't being forced to do so, we don't want an American legal system where lawyers just go after whoever has the deeper pockets claiming they were the ones who caused it and the ones at fault etc.etc.etc. But that is just another case in the general  concept of Geroma B'Nizokin. It isn't unique to witnesses.</p>\n\n\n",

The first four letters allude to Royalty, the last to the 40 years David reigned. <strong>Samuel was from the tribe of Levi</strong> which wore the \"crown\" of Torah. Samuel himself was considered as equal to Moses and Aaron combined. Although he was known as a Levite, being a member of that tribe, he combined within himself elements of the priesthood, being traditionally considered the re-incarnation of the High Priest Aaron. When G–d told Moses in Exodus 4, 14: הלא אהרון אחיך הלוי וכו', \"Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite?\" He implied that there would be a Levite who at the same time was Moses' brother Aaron, i.e. Aaron's re-incarnate, the prophet Samuel.

I think the story's main focus is RYBZ and how he created the new Jewish center in Yavneh, and wasn't intended to discuss the particular details of how each of the other sages survived. There are, in fact, some alternate versions of their escape. One version mentions the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.2.8?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other prominent students of RYBZ</a> together with Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avot_DeRabbi_Natan%2C_Recension_B.29.1?vhe=Vienna,_1887&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot de-Rabbi Natan version B, 29</a>).

Of course we know much of RYBZ's story. There are hints that other sages and their families survived harrowing events.

Due to this, if one throws an object that is שבעה ומשהו one is chayav because the object descends into reshus harabim; but if one throws an object of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Shabbat.8a.5.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שבעה ושני משהויין</a>, he's patur because it never descends completely into reshus harabim but rather remains partially in the makom petur. The calculation for that is 2.9 (of equivalent mashehuin) tefachim of lavud, and 7.2 tefachim of object equals >10 tefachim, which means the object never completely descends into reshus harabim.</p>\n<p>But without a specific definition of a mashehu, I can say that there is always a smaller amount of object that is sticking into makom petur. For example, if the object is within 2.91 literal tefachim of the ground, I can say that an object that is 7.1 literal tefachim is sticking 0.01 tefachim into the makom petur and also in contact with the ground because of lavud. I can also say that when an when an object is 7.01 tefachim, it is in contact with the ground and yet still in a makom petur when it reaches 2.991 tefachim of the ground.</p>\n<p>So what is the concept of shnei mashehuin?

How so?</p>\n<p>In the book \"<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899061931.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wisdom of Hebrew Alphabet</a>\" by R. Munk, says in the prologue:</p>\n<p>\"In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.26-28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 11:26-28</a> we are asked to choose between blessing and curse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רְאֵ֗ה אָנֹכִ֛י נֹתֵ֥ן לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם בְּרָכָ֖ה וּקְלָלָֽה׃ <em><strong>אֶֽת</strong>־הַבְּרָכָ֑ה</em> אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּשְׁמְע֗וּ אֶל־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם הַיּֽוֹם׃ <em><strong>וְהַ</strong>קְּלָלָ֗ה</em> אִם־לֹ֤א תִשְׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם וְסַרְתֶּ֣ם מִן־הַדֶּ֔רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם לָלֶ֗כֶת אַחֲרֵ֛י אֱלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־יְדַעְתֶּֽם׃</p>\n<p>See, this day I set before you blessing and curse: <strong>blessing</strong>, if you obey the commandments of your God יהוה that I enjoin upon you this day; and <strong>curse</strong>, if you do not obey the commandments of your G-d Hashem, but turn away from the path that I enjoin upon you this day and follow other gods, whom you have not experienced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the blessing the emphatic article אֶת is used, while regarding curse אֶת is omitted, (but we have וְהַ). Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.35.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabba 35:1</a> teaches that אֶת denotes the blessing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Abba son of Rabbi Ḥiyya said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: I calculated blessings, I calculated curses; <strong>the blessings are from alef through tav</strong>, <strong>the curses are from vav through heh</strong>. Moreover, they are reversed. Rabbi Avin said: [God says:] ‘If you merit, I will transform the curses into blessings for you. When? When you observe My Torah.’ That is what is written: “If you follow My statutes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding blessings for keeping Shabbos, there are many sources, such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.25.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabba 25:12</a>. Regarding blessings for honoring parents, one is blessed with long life as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 20:12</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Open source implies the existence of a source code, which you can modify. There is no source code for the Talmud and in any case you are not going to produce your own version of the Talmud. What you probably mean is a free version of the Talmud. Open source is a much stronger claim than \"free\" - it implies freedom to modify and adapt to your own purposes (under the condition that the modified version is also open source) which doesn't really make sense for the Talmud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Hebrewbooks.org has old prints for download.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are self-described Reform and Conservative Jews assumed to be halachically Jewish according to Orthodox Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m curious about whether the Orthodox understanding of Halacha says we still have chazakah that the majority of Reform and Conservative are still real Jews (for example, if one is counting them in a minyan, having them cook in a kosher kitchen, getting married etc. if they say they’re Reform or Conservative do we trust them or have a beit din check their halachic status, or do different halachot apply for marriage vs minyan?).</p>\n<p>Obviously the overwhelming majority of them are not observant of Halacha or even Shomer Shabbat according to Orthodox and often even Conservative standards, however, a Reform or Conservative Jew who was raised as such from birth has the din of tinok shenishba (lit. 'captive infant', i.e. held to be unaccountable for their lack of Jewish knowledge/practice).</p>\n<p>There are several factors though why many people that identify as Reform and Conservative Jews might have the status of non-Jews according to Orthodox understanding of halacha, including intermarriage being widespread in both movements and sanctioned officially by the Reform movement, the Reform movement accepting patrilineal descent, the Reform and Conservative movements both perform conversions not recognized by Orthodox halacha (with very few exceptions) and the fact that it’s a self reinforcing cycle (for example, an invalid female convert leads to invalid children, invalid converts in general becoming Rabbis lead to more invalid conversions etc.).</p>\n<p>So should it still be assumed that somebody who says that they're Reform or Conservative is a Jew according to Orthodox halacha, or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>From what I have seen, there don't appear to be any poskim who make sweeping statements regarding the halachic status of either of the two movements.

The most comprehensive and recent treatment of this is in Rabbi Eliezer Melamed's מסורת הגיור (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah), especially pp. 225-227, 231, 351-352, 364, 369-371, 455-456, 462, 536-537 756-758, 764-769, which includes summaries of the opinions of pretty much all poskim of recent centuries with regards to conversion, and in the cited pages, Reform and Conservative conversions. These conversions are of course invalid according to all poskim, but in many specific cases there are leniencies to reconvert individuals in a proper Orthodox conversion for various reasons.

And there is a mitzvah to love also their non-Jewish spouses and children, for they have deep ties to our brethren, and especially when they identify with the Jewish people. And may Hashem help us so that we will merit to shine the light of the Torah so that all will wish to join us in a proper halachic fashion to bring about the great vision of fixing the world in accordance with the Torah and all of its halachic specifics.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is evident that Rabbi Melamed, who has studied the Reform movement quite a bit, is doubtful with regards to whether the Reform movement as a whole, or even a majority, can be regarded as non-Jewish. Of course, this seems to be a hashkafic approach. The halachic approach appears to still be on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>I'm not sure there is one correct answer here, mostly because \"Orthodox halakha\" doesn't mean what it used to. It used to mean, in accordance with the rulings of the Gemara, or the Geonim, or the Mishneh Torah, or the Shulchan Arukh. Nowadays, most Orthodox Batei Din will not accept a conversion done according to the Mishneh Torah/Shulchan Arukh. Why? According to 21st Century Orthodoxy, these sources make conversion too easy.</p>\n<p>Here's all that needs to happen for a conversion according to the Shulchan Arukh</p>\n<p>Shulchan Arukh Yoreh De'ah 268</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a person comes to convert, say to him, \"What did you see that\nmotivated you to come to convert? If you know that Israel, in this\ntime, that the Jewish people are oppressed, eroded, (The words are\nfrom \"Why is your strong one overthrown?\" -Jer. 46:15) insane, and\nsuffering. If he says, I know this and I will still become a part of\nyour people, receive him immediately and tell him the principles of\nthe faith, that God is one and idol worship is forbidden, and tell him\na lot about this, and teach him a few of the lighter mitzvot and a few\nof the more stringent mitzvot, and teach him about some of the\npunishments of the mitzvot, as it says, \"Before you came to learn\nthis, if you ate the forbidden fat, you would not be punished with\nexcommunication, you transgressed Shabbat and you were not punished\nwith stoning; but now, if you eat forbidden food, you will be punished\nwith excommunication; and if you transgress Shabbat you will be\npunished with stoning.\" Don't say too much about this, and don't get\ntoo specific either. And when you teach him about the punishment of\nthe mitzvot, also teach him about the rewards of the mitzvot and teach\nhim that in the doing of certain mitzvot that will merit life in the\nworld to come. There isn't a complete righteous person, rather a\nmaster of wisdom, that does the mitzvot and understands them. And say\nto him: \"You should know that the world to come is hidden from the\nrighteous, who are Israel. As for what you see that Israel is in\ndistress in this world, because it is not granted them to receive the\nabundance of good things in this world like other peoples, lest their\nhearts should be indulged loftily and they should go astray and\nsquander the reward of the world to come. But God didn't bring to them\ntoo much destruction, so that they would not observe. Rather, all of\nthe idolators stand. And you explicate this idea so that he feels the\ndearness of it. If he receives this, circumcise him immediately and\nwait until he is fully healed, and afterwards, immerse him without a\nbarrier. (Some say that you cut or shave his hair and you cut his\nfingernails and his toenails before immersion.) And three learned\nscholars stand at his back and teach him some of the light mitzvot and\nsome of the more stringent mitzvot a second time, and he stands in the\nwater. And if it is a woman, women sit her in the water up to her neck\nand the beit din is outside and they teach her some of the easy\nmitzvot and some of the more stringent mitzvot and she sits in the\nwater and afterwards, she immerses before them and they turn their\nfaces and leave in order that they do not see her when she is getting\nout of the water, and they bless the immersion after she comes out of\nthe water. And once he has immersed, it is as if he is a Jew, but if\nhe goes astray, he is like an apostate Jew - he is still sanctified,\nand his marriage is sanctified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.268.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.268.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>This is an article discussing what a normative Orthodox conversion looks like now, and if you compare it to the Shulchan Arukh it's not hard to tell how different it's become.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At a time when thousands of people are considering conversion to\nJudaism, however, Israel’s Orthodox rabbinic establishment is raising\never-higher barriers to them. While Israel’s chief rabbinate accepts\nmany candidates who are willing to become fully committed Orthodox\nJews, it will not readily accept those who are not ready for total\ncommitment. Thus, a would-be convert must usually spend years studying\nTorah and halacha, or Jewish law, and adopt an entirely Orthodox\nlifestyle in order to be considered for conversion.</p>\n<p>Now, Israel’s increasingly ultra-Orthodox-dominated chief rabbinate is\nattempting to impose its views on the Jewish Diaspora. Here in the\nUnited States, it has already forced the Rabbinical Council of America\n— the Diaspora’s largest Orthodox rabbinical association — into line.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2006, Rabbi Shlomo Amar, Israel’s chief Sephardic\nrabbi, proclaimed that the chief rabbinate would no longer accept\nconversions performed by Orthodox rabbis in the Diaspora, except for\nthose specifically approved by the chief rabbinate. The RCA had to\ndecide how to respond to this affront to the integrity of its members.\nAfter all, the chief rabbi was basically saying that RCA members can’t\nbe trusted to do proper halachic conversions.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the RCA leadership capitulated to the demands of Rabbi Amar.\nThe RCA agreed to establish regional rabbinic courts to handle\nconversions in line with the dictates of the chief rabbi. This means\nthat individual RCA rabbis may no longer perform conversions and\nexpect them to be sanctioned by the RCA — or by the chief rabbinate.\nPower is being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, and only into\nthe hands of those who agree to adopt stringent and restrictive\npositions. The result is that many non-Jews who considered halachic\nconversion will turn to non-halachic means of conversion, or will give\nup on conversion altogether.</p>\n<p>This is a tragedy — and an unnecessary one at that, since there is no\nhalachic reason why the chief rabbinate’s view should carry the day.\nThe Talmud and classic codes of Jewish law actually grant considerable\nleeway in the halachic acceptance of converts. While converts must\n“accept the mitzvot,” or commandments, there is wide latitude in\nunderstanding what this phrase means. The Talmud itself says that we\nmust instruct the candidate for conversion in “some of the major and\nsome of the minor commandments.” There is no requirement or\nexpectation that the candidate must learn all the mitzvot in advance\nof conversion, nor that he or she will promise to keep all the mitzvot\nin every detail after conversion.</p>\n<p>Yet many contemporary rabbinic authorities have taken a far narrower\nand more exclusionary view. Zvi Zohar and Avi Sagi (in their book\n“Giyyur ve-Zehut Yehudit”) found that the narrow view gained traction\nonly as recently as 1876 when Rabbi Yitzchak Shmelkes ruled that\nconversion was to be equated with an absolute commitment to observe\nall mitzvot. Any candidate for conversion who was not committed to\nbecoming fully Orthodox in observance was to be rejected. Later rabbis\nadopted this new position, until it became normative among right-wing\n(and much of the rest of) Orthodoxy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://sephardimhope.com/slamming-the-door-on-converts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://sephardimhope.com/slamming-the-door-on-converts/</a></p>\n<p>According to the Shulchan Arukh, someone can convert in days or weeks. Acceptance of the commandments is a verbal, and not to be burdensome. It's worth noting that every conservative conversion I've seen is stricter than the Shulchan Arukh and takes months, <a href=\"https://maascenter.aju.edu/introduction-to-judaism/intro-current-classes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like this Intro to Judaism course which is 4.5 months long</a>.</p>\n<p>According to common Orthodox practice now, acceptance of the commandments has to be proven by living an observant lifestyle for years. This article goes into this topic more in depth:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jewishideas.org/article/acceptance-commandments-conversion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishideas.org/article/acceptance-commandments-conversion</a></p>\n<p>I've had comments object to my answer and claim that there is still an issue because the judges in a conservative court may not be qualified Dayanim. As far as I'm aware, no conversion requires even a single Dayan. Any Hedyoto, any common Israelite, can sit on a Beit Din for conversion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ben Zion Uziel, the late Chief Sephardic Rabbi, in his very last book\nof Responsa Mishpote Uziel, Even Hoezer 13, p. 54, Jerusalem, 1964\nsays: “It is the Halacha, as we learn from the words of the Rambam,\nthat the reception of proselytes does not require a Bes Din of skilled\nmen, but even with three ordinary men (hedyotos) it is quite\nsufficient.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccarnet.org/responsa-topics/conversion/page/2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ccarnet.org/responsa-topics/conversion/page/2/</a></p>\n<p>Based on all the sources I've read, the obvious potential halakhic issue I see with a conservative conversion is having a female Rabbi on the Beit Din. But you can request all 3 members of your Beit Din be male in order to avoid this halakhic issue. There are other less obvious issues to consider, such as things would invalidate even a ordinary Israelite being a witness, such as heretical beliefs or being a known and open sinner. But these issues can arise with any converting Rabbi, such as Chassidic sects believing their dead Rabbis is the Messiah/God, or the Orthodox Rabbi who filmed his converts naked while immersing. I personally question whether a Judge who sins in the moment of conversion is a proper dayan, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141101191406/http://www.rabbis.org/index_with_RCA_response%20.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">but I'm no Rabbi and the RCA upheld his conversions.</a></p>\n<p>So as per your question as to whether you can rely on conservative converts being halakhically Jewish. If you believe that the halakha is what's written in the Shulchan Arukh/Mishneh Torah then I think it's safe to consider Conservative Jews as Jewish. If you want to be extra careful about the sex of the judges of the Beit Din you can ask who sat on their Beit Din.</p>\n<p>If you believe the halakha is determined by whatever Orthodox communities are doing now, then you should question all conservative converts and even Orthodox converts. I've even heard of some orthodox conversions being revoked.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The rest of my answer is anecdotal. I witnessed someone who received a Conservative and later a private Orthodox Beit Din conversion. I can say with absolute honesty that the Conservative conversion followed the dictates of the Shulchan Arukh and Mishneh Torah except that they allow women Rabbis to serve on the Beit Din, but you can request an all male Beit Din if you want to be in accordance with the Shulchan Arukh.</p>\n<p>The private Orthodox Beit Din was done in accordance with the custom of Egypt where my family came from. And the custom was if a Jewish man marries a non Jewish woman, the Beit Din/Community would initially oppose the union. If they got married anyways, but stayed in the community and grew in observance then the community would grow more accepting. And if the woman became pregnant and wanted to raise the child Jewishly then they would do a conversion for her using the Shulchan Arukh but taking the lenient views on it to make her conversion easier for the sake of the child who would then be raised Jewishly. So in the conversion i saw they interviewed her for several hours regarding the mitzvot, how she planned to observe, how committed she was to raising the child Jewishly, and then they immersed her.</p>\n<p>I feel that both conversions followed the Mishneh Torah and Shulchan Arukh without question, but neither conversion will be recognized by the RCA or Israel's chief Rabbinate.</p>\n<p>Note: I have not witnessed a reform conversion so I cannot speak to their halakhic observance.</p>\n\n\n",

Bamidbar 31:27, camp discipline according to Deut. 23:10-15, etc.) come to a conclusion, and the people transition to peace laws (such as Hakhel instead of an army at Sukkot after the war, see Deut. 31:10).</p>\n<p>The revolt of 66–73 CE (Second Temple, Destruction): This was originally a discretionary war (milchemet reshut) from the perspective of the insurgents – there was initially no prophetic command to attack the Romans, and Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai & Co. considered it unwise; however, when the Romans besieged Jerusalem, the fight for the defenders there certainly became a commanded war (milchemet mitzvah) in the sense of \"saving Israel from the enemy\" – it was about survival; after the city fell and the Temple burned (70 CE), the war was militarily lost; individual pockets of resistance (Masada until 73) continued to fight, but ultimately the war ended in complete defeat; halachically, the mitzvah of redeeming Israel and building the Temple remained, but due to the lack of any real possibility, this was postponed.</p>\n<p>Leading Poskim of recent decades have predominantly recognized that Israel's defensive wars today are classified as milchemet mitzvah <a href=\"https://jewishaction.com/religion/jewish-law/whats-the-truth-about-milchemet-mitzvah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jewishaction.com</a>; already in the 1948 War of Independence, rabbis like R. Shlomo Zevin wrote it was a \"milchemet mitzvah\" both because it is the rescue of Israel from enemies (Rambam) and because it concerns Eretz Israel (Ramban); Rav Herzog and the Chazon Ish – although not Zionist-oriented – agreed in principle that national defense and the protection of Jewish life are halachically obligatory (even if they set other priorities for individuals, see below); Rav Elyashiv, for example, explicitly referred to the Yom Kippur War of 1973 as a milchemet mitzvah with all relevant Halachot; Rav Ovadia Yosef wrote that even the Entebbe rescue operation in 1976 had the status of a milchemet mitzvah – because it involved the rescue of Jewish hostages (thus prototypically Asrat Israel mi-yad Tzar); this assessment has practical consequences: in a milchemet mitzvah, even grooms, Torah scholars, etc., must fundamentally participate; there are leniencies in the areas of Kashrut, Shabbat, etc., that go beyond normal Pikuach Nefesh; for example, Tzitz Eliezer (R. E. Waldenberg) argues that in wartime the rule \"your own life comes first\" does not apply – rather \"all are collectively obligated to risk their lives for their brothers... within the framework of the laws of the community and state leadership\" <a href=\"https://machonmeir.net/war-harav-eliezer-melamed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">machonmeir.net</a>; soldiers in the field may also, under certain circumstances, eat forbidden foods without immediate life danger if it serves combat morale or strength (Tzitz Eliezer XVIII,70, based on Magen Avraham and R.

Once Chananyah ben Chizkiyah resolved the contradictions in Yechezkel, and similar methods were used for Mishlei and Koheles, then the fact that the average person might not know those reconciliations no longer matters, since they can rely on the Torah sages to tell them that such reconciliations exist and that there's nothing objectionable in these books.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The rabbis had to make decisions in the face of mountains of candidate books.

Was there a Navi who received that word of Hashem? Was it Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who heard it from Hashem or an angel or a bat kol? Or are they merely saying that Hashem would say something like that? There is clearly a heavy weight with the word of Hashem, is it applied to the above example? Is this counted as someone who is speaking in the name of Hashem? How does this relate to Deuteronomy 18:18-22? Is this applying the weight of Hashem's word without any of the responsibility of the one who speaks in the name of Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara was written after the era of prophecy had come to a close.  The aggadeta in the OP's question should not be taken literally. Examples of such aggadetas are analyzed by Rabbi Tzvi-Hirsch Chajes in his book \"<a href=\"https://www.yasharbooks.com/Guide.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Student's Guide through the Talmud</a>\", chapter XXVII <em>Aggadoth expressing profound ideas in figurative style</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are several subjects in the Gemara whose meaning cannot be taken in literal sense, because the text expounded literally would depict G-d as corporeal being, and would also at times involve an act of blasphemy. We should, and we are, indeed, in duty bound to believe the transmitters of true Kabbalah (i.e. <em>tradition</em>), who are known to us as righteous and saintly men and also as accomplished scholars, would not speak merely in an odd manner. We must therefore believe that their words were uttered with an allegorical or mystical sense and that they point to matters of the most elevated significance, far beyond our mental grasp.</p>\n<p>The Rabbis deemed it proper not to expose to the masses the mystical doctrines that were hidden in their words, and so they uncovered only one handbreadth, leaving ten handbreadths covered. The literal sense of such words of theirs was only as if it were a mere outer garment beneath which lay a precious ideas observed only by the wise and understanding student.</p>\n<p>... (These types of aggaddos) which according to ordinary reason, seem to have no sense and are at first glance contradictory to the principles of our religion and the fundamentals of our faith, contain important intimations on matters of high worth. And these profound thoughts are merely enveloped in a covering of many shells, the inner meaning left for those alone who can penetrate into the hiden things of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why must there be some delay, or agonizing condition? Why not divorce immediately with a promise to eachother to await a future reunion?

We say in the blessings of nisuin \"...an everlasting edifice\". Saying the blessings of marriage, paying the kesuvah and then rewriting it, making an additional $50k+ wedding with the proper band, food and accomodations is a big deal.</p>\n<p>Many sources in the Torah stress the importance of making a wedding extremely lavish, because it is the foundation of the entire marriage.</p>\n<p>Some sources (like the rugichover) even discuss how the entire marriage is one continuous effect that is constantly being renewed every instant, and the cause that makes it become renewed is from the moment of betrothal.</p>\n<p>That's one of the many reasons why the day of the wedding is extremely important, and why it's worth it to spend tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars just for that one day.</p>\n<p>According to Shulchan Aruch, the day of the wedding is like a personal Yom Kippur for the bride and the groom. Once one has already gone through all of that trouble it's no light task to simply do it again if there's no need to, there's nothing wrong with a conditional divorce.</p>\n<p>A divorce is also a big deal and should be avoided if needed.</p>\n<p>The mishnah says that one should never divorce one's wife unless he needs to (there's different opinions within that scope, ranging from being so strict that only if she actually acted immoral/immodestly should one divorce her, to even if he found one more beautiful than her etc., but still, it can't just be for no reason).</p>\n<p>Especially when it applies to one's first wife, the Talmud teaches that if someone chose vishalom divorces his first wife, the throne of Glory itself is dripping with tears.</p>\n<p>In addition, in the vast majority of cases, when a divorce happens, the husband is obligated to pay her the Kesuvah amount specified at the time of the begining of the marriage. This could involve oftentimes seizing real estate property from people who bought land from the husband during the marriage period, if husband doesn't have enough money to pay back, which could cause all kinds of additional complications and court cases etc.</p>\n<p>Also, there's no limit as to how many times one could be called for war.</p>\n<p>If it's a one time war, then possibly there might be some thought of a justification to do a full divorce, even with all of the reasons not to in place.</p>\n<p>But what if one spends an additional $50k+ and goes through all of the effort to get remarried after the war, then another couple years pass and he's called in to fight again?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why isn't Tefillin stressed more spiritually than physically",
    "content": "# Why isn't Tefillin stressed more spiritually than physically\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah says in Deuteronomy 6:8 \"וּקְשַׁרְתָּ֥ם לְא֖וֹת עַל־יָדֶ֑ךָ וְהָי֥וּ לְטֹטָפֹ֖ת בֵּ֥ין עֵינֶֽיךָ׃\n\" but why is the main emphasis in our culture nowadays about the physical Tefillin? The main purpose is what it was made to do, which was to be a physical \"sign\" so that our spiritual elements can get the aid they need to have the correct notions. As it clearly says in Exodus 13:9 \"וְהָיָה֩ לְךָ֨ לְא֜וֹת עַל־יָדְךָ֗ וּלְזִכָּרוֹן֙ בֵּ֣ין עֵינֶ֔יךָ לְמַ֗עַן תִּהְיֶ֛ה תּוֹרַ֥ת יְהֹוָ֖ה בְּפִ֑יךָ כִּ֚י בְּיָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה הוֹצִֽאֲךָ֥ יְהֹוָ֖ה מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃\n\" that the reason to have the sign (for distinction) and the <strong>remembrance</strong> is so that (למען) we have Hashem's Torah in our mouth. These physical signs are there to help our spiritual side, because it's hard to remember sometimes what our heart should be doing, and a physical sign will assist many, especially the layman who is not so experienced in controlling his heart.</p>\n<p>This idea seems to be strengthened by a couple of points, one of them being what's written in Proverbs 3:3 \"חֶ֥סֶד וֶאֱמֶ֗ת אַֽל־יַעַ֫זְבֻ֥ךָ קָשְׁרֵ֥ם עַל־גַּרְגְּרוֹתֶ֑יךָ כָּ֝תְבֵ֗ם עַל־ל֥וּחַ לִבֶּֽךָ\n\" which clearly shows that these elements should be bound and written metaphorically and not physically; this adds to my point of what is of higher emphasis, the physical or spiritual (in the heart). If one just goes through the physical motions without the heart actually engaging, then what value do they provide to the person other than their development of devotion? Whereas if they devote themselves but also understand why the sign is there, then they develop their devotion and their heart so that their heart chooses to connect to Hashem instead of choosing to connect to those thoughts of vanity while wearing his Tefillin. This will also help the person continue to do it their whole life because they understand the value of it and the detriment if they don't do it.</p>\n<p>This point has some connection to what the Rambam said in Guide for the Perplexed Part 1 Chapter 50 \"דע, אתה המעיין בחיבורי זה, שההַאֲמָנָה אינה העניין הנאמר, אלא העניין המצטייר (נתפס, מומשג) בנפש, אם משתכנעים לגביו שהוא כך כפי שהצטייר.\n\"\n<strong>And Deuteronomy 30:14 \"כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב אֵלֶ֛יךָ הַדָּבָ֖ר מְאֹ֑ד בְּפִ֥יךָ וּבִֽלְבָבְךָ֖ לַעֲשֹׂתֽוֹ</strong>\n\"</p>\n<p>To summarize the question: Why isn't the main priority and emphasis regarding Tefillin on the spiritual side (in the heart and mouth) rather than just the motions of the Tefillin; there seems to be more benefit that way. I am not saying not to wear Tefillin.</p>\n<p>I very much appreciate the work you guys do on this site.</p>\n\n\n",

This is first and foremost the sacrifice discussed here, the עולה, burnt-offering, concerning which the Torah stipulated that all of it is to be burnt up on the Altar. This is the meaning of the word כליל, (verse 15). This burnt-offering is the most highly regarded of all the offerings and that is why the Torah emphasises that היא העולה, “it is the upwards striving offering, etc.” Similarly, in Ezekiel 10,20 when the prophet describes היא החיה אשר ראיתי, “this is the chayah which I saw.” the extra word היא shows that of a variety of similar offerings or beings the one singled out with this extra word is considered the most elevated, the most highly regarded. The burnt-offering also possesses the quality of atoning for sinful thoughts as we know from Job, 1,5 where we are told that Job would offer such burnt-offerings after family gatherings during the various feasts in respect of each member of his family. [Had the offering been in respect of deeds committed, he would not have had to do this on behalf of everyone. Ed.] According to Ezekiel 20,32 this offering was in respect of sinful thoughts. Seeing man entertains these kinds of thoughts mostly at night the offering may remain on the altar all night long to counteract the thoughts of the person at night which are not carried out until daytime on whose behalf it had been brought. The prophet Michah 2,1 phrases it thus: “Ah, those who plan iniquity and design evil on their beds; when morning comes they do it, for they have the power.” This is why the Torah commanded that the atonement should occur at the time the iniquity is being committed. Seeing that in essence the sin was insubstantive, i.e. only in the mind, the offering is to dissolve entirely in the wind, the smoke rising into the air. The animal, so to speak, returns to the regions of the spirit it came from. No substantive part of the world, i.e. a body, is allowed to derive any benefit from this offering. This is one aspect of the burnt-offering.</p>\n<p>The second aspect is the lesson of how important it is for the creature to serve his Creator. It is a well known fact that man has to relate to his G’d from a position of being submissive, humble. One needs to demonstrate this both while praying and while performing any of the other relatively easy commandments or even the difficult commandments. One needs to remain aware that performance of such commandments is not meant to be a “feather in our cap,” but is meant to enhance G’d’s glory. We need to remain constantly aware that our flesh is weak and that it is not capable of fulfilling the commandments in the manner they ought to be performed. We have to learn from Avraham who described himself as עפר ואפר, “dust and ashes,” though he had already offered his very life for Hashem (Genesis 18,27). King David expressed a similar sentiment when he said (Psalms 15,4) “man must be contemptible in his own eyes.” [He must feel that he has done less than a fraction of what is expected of him. Ed.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>The pasuk Vayikra 6:6 based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tikkunei_Zohar.73a.2?vhe=Tikkunei_Zohar_-_Vocalized&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tikunei Zohar 73a</a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קָם סָבָא חַד מִבָּתַר טוּלָא (כותלא), וְאָמַר רַבִּי רַבִּי בּוֹצִינָא קַדִּישָׁא, קוּם אַדְלֵיק שְׁרַגָּא דְאִיהִי מִצְוָה, שְׁכִינְתָּא קַדִּישָׁא, דַּעֲלָהּ אִתְּמַר (ויקרא ו ו) אֵשׁ תָּמִיד תּוּקַד עַל הַמִּזְבֵּחַ לֹא תִכְבֶּה, וַעֲלָהּ אִתְּמַר (שמות כז כ) לְהַעֲלֹת נֵר תָּמִיד, נֵר יהו\"ה אִתְקְרִיאַת וַדַּאי, אוֹר דְּנָהִיר בֵּיהּ נִשְׁמַת אָדָם, קוּם אַדְלֵיק בָּהּ.</p>\n<p>One older person stood up from behind a wall, and said: Rebbe my teacher, The Holy Light, come and light candles, for that is a Mitzva (commandment), on that it is said: An everlasting fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it should not be extinguished.

Does anyone discuss this?</p>\n<p>(Looking at some of the Rishonim regarding the sugya of הורתו שלא בקדושה ולידתו בקדושה (יבמות צח.), explaining why such individuals are Jewish, the Rishonim's choice of expression focuses on the circumstances of the child's birth, rather than who their mother is. For example, the תוס' רי\"ד says \"דהא לא נתגייר אלא <strong>בקדושה נולד</strong>\".\nBut I don't consider that to be such a strong proof.)</p>\n<p>I tried looking for this halacha in the Rambam, and in Tur/SA, to see if their choice of wording could imply one way or another - but I wasnt successful in finding this fundamental halacha in either.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are arguments both ways.  Some say the legal mother is the birth mother, because a midrash says that Dinah was conceived in Rachel's womb, and Joseph in Leah’s womb, but that God switched the embryos so Rachel could give birth to a son, Joseph. [Targum Yonatan on Genesis 30:21] The basis is that all six times Leah has a son, the Torah says:  “Leah conceived and bore a son”.  But when it comes to Dinah, it just says:  “Leah bore a daughter”.  Yet, the Torah clearly refers to Leah as Dinah's mother [Gen. 34:1].  So we learn that she who gives birth is the mother, not she who produced the egg.</p>\n<p>The Talmud says that when Esther’s mother became pregnant with her, her father died, and when she was born, her mother died. [Megillah 13a]  This could mean that Esther’s mother did not become her mother until Esther was born.  The Midrash says \"If someone begins to perform a commandment and does not complete it, and someone else comes and completes it, the one who has completed it gets the credit. [Deut. R. 8:4]  Here, the one who completes the task is the birth mother, so she is the mother.</p>\n<p>So far, most rabbinical authorities rule that the one giving birth is the mother.  But there are other arguments.  The discussion continues.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rabbi you are quoting is suggesting that a child born through surrogacy <em>could</em> have a Jewish mother but not be Jewish, or have a non-Jewish mother but be Jewish, as emerging from the womb of an unrelated woman is what defines Jewishness.</p>\n<p>Aside from this possibility not having a clear rationale, I believe it can be proved wrong from the very Gemara you reference (Yevamot 78a-b). The Gemara says that if עובר לאו ירך אמו (a foetus is not considered ‘a limb of its mother,’ but an independent entity), the foetus of a woman who converts to Judaism during pregnancy requires its own immersion, and this is achieved in the mikveh together with the mother, as the body of the mother is not a <em>chatzitza</em> (blockage).</p>\n<p>Were the suggestion you make correct, even if the body of the mother were a a <em>chatzitza</em>, the baby should be Jewish just by emerging from the womb of a Jewish mother.</p>\n<p>So in short, the answer is that \"being Jewish\" is a function of having a Jewish mother.</p>\n\n\n",

Shouldn't it be the other way around?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all, these names are not defined only by judgement and mercy, there are other definitions, such as:</p>\n<p>YKVK- היה הווה ויהיה (infinite/eternal),</p>\n<p>Elokim- All powerful… etc…</p>\n<p>-all among many other meanings to the names whether known or unknown to us.</p>\n<p>However, even with just the meaning you brought, I think it’s clear that mercy is actually the greater trait.</p>\n<p>One way we see this is that Hashems right hand is Mercy and his left is judgement, and in Judaism there is always an importance to the right hand over the left, like it says in Tehillim (118:15) “Yemin Hashem oseh chayil”.</p>\n<p>We also say in davening “asei lemaan yeminecha”.</p>\n<p>The Arizal (Ohr Tzaddikim 2:63)\nSays to give charity with the right hand. This is based on a medrash (Devarim rabba) that says that charity and Torah are in Hashems right hand.</p>\n<p>This is in addition to all other mitzvos we do with the right, of which there are many.</p>\n<p>On a more theological level though, mercy has always been the idea that was a revelation. Idol worshippers never had a concept of mercy. Their relationship to their deities was one of sacrifice and punishment. That was and still is the basic idea of a ruler, to exercise power (Elokim).\nThis is indeed why the Torah refers to other “gods” as elokim, because in terms of power and might, they share that mentality with Hashem.</p>\n<p>It’s YKVK that differentiates Hashem from other gods. And as Rav Nachman writes (Likutei Moharan I:64), this world was created so Hashem can show his mercy.</p>\n<p>Mercy in this context though is not merely the mercy humans display, like when you feel bad for someone so you give them something to make them feel better. Mercy as it pertains to Hashem is so great that it overrides Hashems own Godly judgement. But more importantly, it exhibits Hashems supreme control over the universe. Only a being with infinite knowledge, who exists outside of time and space can make a proper decision to override judgement. Who else can say in the grand scheme of things that in this situation the rules of the world need not apply? Surely not an idol who’s specialized “power” is over the sun or moon or water and knows nothing outside of that… The answer of course is only the Grand Schemer himself.</p>\n<p>So essentially, to be able to enact mercy, really means that Hashems not just powerful but he’s the grand Schemer, and by definition overrides the Elokim part of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

This explains the folk saying that people say: The ewe follows the ewe; the daughter’s actions are the same as her mother’s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And they also say in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.4b.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sota 4b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara answers: If you wish, say that he was married and separated from his wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And without a doubt he was a great diligent student of the Torah and also entered the PaRDe\"S as described later, so he separated completedly from the ways of this world. And when he taught <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.63b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yebamos 63b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Regarding anyone who does not engage in the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply) Ben Azzai says: It is (considered) as though he sheds blood and also diminishes the Divine Image, as it is stated: “And you, be fruitful and multiply,” after the verse that alludes to both shedding blood and the Divine Image.</p>\n<p>They said to ben Azzai: There is a type of scholar who expounds well and fulfills his own teachings well, and another who fulfills well and does not expound well. But you, who have never married, expound well on the importance of procreation, and yet you do not fulfill well your own teachings. Ben Azzai said to them: What shall I do, as my soul yearns for Torah, and I do not wish to deal with anything else. It is possible for the world to be maintained by others, who are engaged in the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In all likelihood, once he divorced the daughter of R' Akivah his Rabbi, he then separated from her and afterwards complained about it, saying <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.74b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 74b</a>, when he overheard the argument of R' Eliezer, R' Akiva, and R' Yehishua regarding husband's or yavam' ability to nullify of vows of a woman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The baraita adds a comment: Ben Azzai stated his response to hearing this discussion in this language: Woe [ḥaval] to you, ben Azzai, that you did not serve Rabbi Akiva properly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rashi explains that this is to tell us that Eisav kissed Yaakov  with a full heart and not just for show.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>What caused Eisav to suddenly show his emotions?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What can we learn from this?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One can learn the answer from well-known midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.78.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 78:9</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell upon his neck, and kissed him, and they wept” (Genesis 33:4).\n“Esau ran to meet him…and kissed him [vayishakehu]” – it is dotted above it. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Every place you find the script more numerous than the dots, you expound the script; the dots more numerous than the script, you expound the dots. Here, neither is the script more numerous than the dots, nor are the dots more numerous than the script. Rather, it teaches that at that moment he was overcome with mercy and he kissed him with all his heart. Rabbi Yannai said to him: If so, why is it dotted over it? Rather, it teaches that he did not come to kiss him, but rather to bite him, and Jacob’s neck was transformed into marble and the teeth of that wicked one were blunted. Why does the verse state: “And they wept”? It is, rather, that this one wept over his neck, and that one wept over his teeth. Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan derives it from here: “Your neck is like the ivory tower…” (Song of Songs 7:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The literal meaning of the midrash, according to Rabbi Yannai, is that Esav tested Yaakov by acting as a true brother and trying to sway his heart. At the same time, in the mind of Yaakov, Eisav was coming as a ruthless and cruel killer with an army of 400 armed men. Thus, we see, that Eisav tried to split Yaakov's mind and Yaakov's heart, force him to act contrary to his convictions, and get trapped in the land of Seir. Technically, the separation of head and body is called <em>melikah</em> and that's why Eisav's most dangerous descendant, Amalek can be read as \"am melikah* - nation of <em>melikah</em>. It is also related to Esav's death, when his head was separated from his body, i.e. Eisav died from what he did to others. The fact, that Hashem made Yaakov's neck strong like marble according to Rabbi Yannai, means that Hashem gave Yaakov extra strength to resist Eisav's emotional outbreak.</p>\n<p>According to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Eisav felt pity for Yaakov, who just gave much of what he earned to him. It looked in his eyes as a proof that the blessing, which Yaakov took ahead of Eisav from Yitzchak, did not materialize. Yaakov looked meek, while Eisav was a head of an army of men. Certainly, in such a situation Eisav would not be destroying Yaakov and his family in front of 400 armed men. But if Eisav could trap Yaakov to the land of Seir - there he could do what he pleased without any witnesses.</p>\n<p>We also see a similar point in Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.6?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 46:6</a> when Yaakov takes his posessions to go to Egypt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשר רכשו בארץ כנען WHICH THEY HAD GOTTEN IN THE LAND OF CANAAN — But all that he had gotten in Padan-aram he gave to Esau in payment for his share in the Cave of Machpelah. He said, “The possessions I obtained outside the land are of no value to me”. It is to this that the words refer (Genesis 50:5) “[Bury me in my burying-place] which כריתי” I obtained for myself by means of a כרי. He placed before him (Esau) piles of gold and silver like a heap (כרי) of corn and said to him, “Take these in exchange for your share in the Cave of Machpelah” (Midrash Tanchuma, Vayechi 6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do the Sages often believe that the word רוב mean \"majority,\" when it clearly means \"a lot\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems clear that the word רוב in biblical Hebrew means \"a large amount.\" For example, Bereshit 48:16</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְיִדְגּוּ לָרֹב בְּקֶרֶב הָאָרֶץ may they teem into multitudes in the midst of the earth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>certainly does not mean the descendants of Ephraim and Menashe should be the \"majority\" of the world (although in theory it could), but that they should be many. The same meaning is clearly implied in Devarim 1:10, \"וְהִנְּכֶם הַיּוֹם כְּכוֹכְבֵי הַשָּׁמַיִם לָרֹב.\" It may be pronounced differently, but this is clearly the same word in Bamidbar 13:18 \"הֶחָזָק הוּא הֲרָפֶה הַמְעַט הוּא אִם רָב\" or 22:3 \"וַיָּגׇר מוֹאָב מִפְּנֵי הָעָם מְאֹד כִּי רַב הוּא\" and in many, many (a \"multitude\", one might say) other places in Tanakh.</p>\n<p>Yet, in some of these instances, the Sages seem to read the word as if it means \"a majority,\" as in, the larger part of a whole. The most famous example is Shemos 23:2 \"לֹֽא־תִהְיֶ֥ה אַחֲרֵֽי־רַבִּ֖ים לְרָעֹ֑ת וְלֹא־תַעֲנֶ֣ה עַל־רִ֗ב לִנְטֹ֛ת אַחֲרֵ֥י רַבִּ֖ים לְהַטֹּֽת\" (which is a difficult reading for other reasons, as Rashi and the commentators note there). But it also comes up elsewhere, such as in Megillah 16b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי מׇרְדֳּכַי הַיְּהוּדִי מִשְׁנֶה לַמֶּלֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ וְגָדוֹל לַיְּהוּדִים וְרָצוּי לְרוֹב אֶחָיו לְרוֹב אֶחָיו {אסתר י׳:ג׳} וְלֹא לְכׇל אֶחָיו מְלַמֵּד שֶׁפֵּירְשׁוּ מִמֶּנּוּ מִקְצָת סַנְהֶדְרִין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam even appears to have a novel biblical reading based upon this assumption in the beginning of Hil. Teshuvah Ch. 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אדם שעונותיו מרובין על זכיותיו, מיד הוא מת ברשעו, שנאמר ״על רוב עונך״ (ירמיהו ל׳:י״ד). וכן מדינה שעונותיה מרובין, מיד היא אובדת, שנאמר ״זעקת סדם ועמורה כי רבה״ (בראשית י״ח:כ׳). וכן כל העולם כולו, אם היו עונותיהם מרוביןא, מיד הן נשחתין, שנאמר ״וירא י״י כי רבה רעת האדם בארץ״ (בראשית ו׳:ה׳):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question is, <em>how are these readings justified if the word \"Rov\" clearly means multitude</em>?</p>\n<p>Possible answers might be (1) there is at least one instance in Tanakh where the context indicates that the word <em>must</em> mean \"majority\" and cannot be interpreted otherwise or (2) in these particular instances, there is some other hint in the text that motivated these rabbinic readings?</p>\n<p>[And yes I know that this question has some methodological assumptions that might not be universally accepted]</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps he meant to say \"animate but non-human objects.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Thanks to Sholom, we can also use <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.2.18?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim on Hoshea 2:18</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והיה ביום ההוא נאום ה' תקראי אישי</strong>, שם בעל מורה על הממשלה והקנין שמושל על הדבר מפני שהוא שלו וקנינו, ושם איש מורה על האהבה והקורבה והאישות, ועד עתה שלא היה לה' קורבה עמהם, והשגחתו היתה נסתרת ומעוטפת במסך טבעי היו עובדים מצד היראה וקוראים לו בעלי מצד ממשלתו עליהם, שבזה יביטו לפעמים אל משרתיו אשר הם אמצעיים אל השפע המגיע להם מאתו על ידם וייראו ויכבדו גם אותם, אבל לעתיד יתהלך בתוכם ויתן להם ברכותיו מבלי אמצעי כאשר יתיחד איש עם אשתו, כמ\"ש חז\"ל ע\"ז שתהיה ככלה בבית חמיה ולא ככלה בית אביה, כי יהיה מעונתו בעולם השפל לשכון כבוד בתוכם, ותקבל שפע האלהית פנים אל פנים, ותעבוד מאהבה ולא תירא ותכבד זולתו:</p>\n<p>And in that day — declares  G-D — You will call [Me] <em>Ishi</em>, and no more will you call Me <em>Baali</em>.  The name בעל is refers to one's rulership and ownership, i.e. one rules over a thing (or person) because it (he/she) is his and acquired. The name איש refers to love and closeness of relation. Until this point, for Hashem there was no closeness with them, and His providence was hidden and wrapped in a natural veil. They worshiped Him out of fear and called Him בעלי because of His rule over them, so that in this way they would sometimes look at His servants (i.e. angels, etc.) who are intermediaries, through which people receive His abundance (שפע), and they would fear and honor these intermediaries as well. But in the future, He will walk among them and give them His blessings without intermediaries just like a man unites with his wife. As the Sages say, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.87a.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 87a</a>) \"<em>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She shall be like a bride in her father-in-law’s house, where she experiences a close relationship with her husband.

    "content": "# Apparent contradiction in the Aruch Hashulchan regarding the laws of the morning blessings\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 47:16) asks how is it that one can fulfill the obligation of Birchas Hatorah by reciting the Brachah of “Ahavah Rabbah”, being that the main parts of a Brachah are the beginning and the end, and he goes on to explain the connection between the beginning and end of “Ahavah Rabbah” to Birchas Hatorah.</p>\n<p>Now later on (OC 52:8) the Aruch Hashulchan writes that he does not know of any reason why one would not fulfill the obligation of the Brachah of “Matir Asurim” by reciting those words in the Brachah of “Mechayeh Hameisim”.</p>\n<p>The question is: didn’t he write previously that the main parts of a Brachah are the beginning and end? if so, in this case, there doesn’t seem to be an apparent connection between the words “Matir Asurim” to the end of the Brachah of “Mechayeh Hameisim”?</p>\n<p>P.S. thanks to @DoubleAA for bringing the second Aruch Hashulchan to my attention <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/145645/finishing-a-berachah-when-in-doubt#comment487646_145645\">here</a>!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The blessing over the Torah is different from other blessings, because there's a mitzvah (Torah-level, according to all opinions according to the Aroch Hashulchan 47:2) to say a blessing before studying Torah, while the other blessings are general expressions of praise and thanks but not independent obligations. If you haven't fulfilled your mitzvah obligation, you still have to say it. But if it's just an expression of praise, you don't repeat a (rabbinic) blessing unless you're innovating something you haven't already said, and possibly even something that isn't somehow included by implication (as in 46:12 for שלא עשני blessings).</p>\n<p>So (it seems to me), it doesn't matter how many times you mention the <em>Torah in a blessing</em>, as long as you haven't said a <em>blessing on the Torah</em> you still need to say it. That's why he has to prove that the beginning and end of the blessing are about the Torah, to prove that this is an actual blessing on the Torah, not one that mentions the Torah incidentally. For anything else, an incidental mention is enough of a reason not to repeat it.</p>\n<p>A second possibility: Assume that the above principle (that the blessing needs to be <em>on</em> the Torah and not just <em>mention</em> the Torah) is doubtful (as indeed he does express doubt regarding whether the similar themes of the other blessings exempt each other, 52:8). Even calling this a doubt, you would still need to repeat the blessing over the Torah in a case of doubt, because it's a Torah-level obligation (47:6). Whereas for the other blessings, which are rabbinic, the guiding principle he mentions behind not repeating them as the rule ספק ברכות להקל, which only applies to the rabbinic blessings and not to the blessing over the Torah (46:12, 52:8).</p>\n\n\n",

(Tikvat reshaim)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a concept in Shaar Gilgulim, that there are certain great but evil men, who have a great potential, but they are doing mostly evil due to the origin of their soul. However, since every soul/human has a holy part, they therefore usually do something very very good during their lifetime.</p>\n<p>Some examples could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bilaam, the evil magican (who blessed Israel)</li>\n<li>The rebellious Korah (whose descendants were very righteous)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Etc. It was explained that (the soul part of?) Bilaam finally appeared later in a good incarnation (because he was overwhelmed by his good inclination at a critical moment).</p>\n<p>The question is: does this explanation diminish the possibility of teshuva? Since if somebody has such a great soul but his soul is mostly from the evil side, that compels him to do great but cruel, immoral, etc. things. On the other hand, if somebody has a holy soul root he will do certainly good things, because that is his inclination by birth.</p>\n<p>Did the explainations about the motivations of souls in Shaar HaGilgulim  change the traditional rabbinic view about the scope of free will and the possibility to self refinement, after the spread of the teachings of Arizal?</p>\n<p>I think these texts should change how we are viewing individual human life stories and human history as whole, and they raise a lot of questions.</p>\n\n\n",

Admittedly, that's not a strong argument, but that question would be much more answerable; we have an explicit pasuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודור רביעי ישובו הנה כי לא־שלם עון האמרי עד־הנה</p>\n<p>But in the fourth generation they shall come back here, for the iniquity of the Emori is not yet full.

It seems he is basing this on the advice that these nations (especially Mamre) gave advice to Avraham about circumcision for his Brit Milah (Bereshit 18:1, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Bereishit.18.1?vhe=Gur_Aryeh,_Machon_Yerushalyim,_1989-1995&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siftei_Chakhamim%2C_Genesis.18.1?vhe=Sifsei_Chachomim_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siftei Chachamim</a> there). Rabbi Henkin adds that this merit delayed the conquering of the land because Hashem wasn't going to give the land in stages, as each one of the nations reached their \"measure iniquity\" one by one, but rather waited until all of them were \"full of iniquity\", incuding these meritorious ones.</p>\n<p>As we know, Hashem pays back good, even the small good of the wicked (see Ramban, Shaar HaGemul).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the status of the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Book of the Wisdom of Solomon is found in the Apocrypha and is used by a number of Christian groups. Notably, for our purposes, the Ramban quotes it in his introduction to his commentary on B'reishis. He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְרָאִיתִי הַסֵּפֶר הַמְתֻרְגָּם הַנִּקְרָא חָכְמְתָא רַבְּתָא דִּשְׁלֹמֹה, וְכָתוּב בּוֹ: \"וְלֹא מִמְּתֹם הֲוָת תּוֹלָדְתָא חֲדֵיתָא לְמֶלֶךְ אוֹ לְשַׁלִּיט דַּחֲדָיו מַעֲלָנָא דְּכָל בַּר נַשׁ לְעָלְמָא, וּמַפְּקָנָא שַׁוִּיאַת חֲדָיו מִיטוּל כֵּן צַלִּית וְאִיתְיְהִיבַת לִי רוּחָא דְּחָכְמְתָא, וְקָרֵית וְאָתֵית לִי רוּחָא דְּאַיְדַעְתָּא, צְבֵית בָּהּ יַתִּיר מִן שִׁבְטָא וְכָרְסְוָתָא\". יֹאמַר, כִּי לֹא מִדָּבָר תִּהְיֶה תּוֹלֶדֶת מְיֻחֶדֶת לְמֶלֶךְ אוֹ לְשַׁלִּיט, אֶחָד הוּא בִּיאַת כָּל אִישׁ בָּעוֹלָם, וִיצִיאָה שָׁוָה לְכֻלָּם יַחַד, וּבַעֲבוּר כֵּן הִתְפַּלַּלְתִּי וְנָתַן לוֹ רוּחַ חָכְמָה, וְקָרָאתִי וּבָאָה לִי רוּחַ דַּעַת, בָּחַרְתִּי בָּהּ יוֹתֵר מִן הַשֵּׁבֶט וְהַכִּסֵּא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I have seen the Aramaic translation of the book called The Great Wisdom of Solomon, and in it is written: “There is nothing new in the birth of a king or ruler; there is one entrance for all people into the world, and one exit alike. Therefore I have prayed, and the spirit of wisdom was given to me, and I have called out and the spirit of knowledge came to me; I chose it above scepter and throne.” (Charles B. Chavel translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the halachic/hashkafic status of this book?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Elsewhere Ramban himself addressed the question of why Wisdom of Solomon wasn't included in the Canon. In Drashat HaRamban al Divrei Kohelet (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38545&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Schwartz ed., p. 9</a>) he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ומצינו עוד ספר שנקרא חכמתא רבתא דשלמה והוא בלשון תרגום חמור מאוד והגוים העתיקו[הו] מן הלשון ההוא ואני חושב שלא העתיקוהו אנשי חזקיהו מלך יהודה אלא ירד עמהם לבבל על פה ושם אמרוהו בלשונם כי היו חכמות ולא נאמר ברוח הקודש.\"</p>\n<p>\"And we find another book called The Great Wisdom of Solomon which is written in difficult Aramaic and the Christians have translated it from that language. I believe that this book was not arranged by the Men of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, but that it went with the Jews to Babylon orally and there they fixed it in their language, for it only contains sayings of wisdom and has not been written by inspiration.\" (translation from A. Marx, '<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259404?seq=4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">An Aramaic Fragment of the Wisdom of Solomon</a>', <em>JBL</em> 40 (1921), p. 60).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Ramban the book isn't canonical because it wasn't entirely written with Ruach Hakodesh and it was also written down much later than the Biblical Period, in Babylon. However, it does contain some real wisdom, which is why it can be referenced.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the book was mentioned in other Jewish works, such as Livnat Hasapir by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi David b.

    "content": "# Can a husband make a bracha on lighting Chanukah candles when away from home?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that there are circumstances in which a husband traveling during Chanukah may rely on his wife lighting candles at home. But suppose the husband chooses to light anyway, in circumstances where his personal fulfillment may be questionable. E.g., suppose he is staying in a hotel, but will light in a Chabad House where he eats. Should he make a bracha given that he can certainly be yotze with his wife's lighting?</p>\n<p>It seems to me that we commonly say the brachot over the menorah lighting under other doubtful conditions, e.g., in shul, so maybe the aspect of pirsumei nisa makes this different from other mitzvot, and the brachot are justified in any case. Or maybe the existence of a doubt regarding brachot is a reason specifically not to light candles if one can be yotze through one's wife!

On the first night, he also says the first Bracha - שהחיינו.</p>\n<p>He then mentions an opinion that if he wants to, he can light his own Chanukia and make all the Brachot.</p>\n<p><strong>The Chayei Adam then seems to prefer this solution:</strong> His wife lights as early as possible so that the traveler will have fulfilled his obligation by the time he wants to light. Yet he also should light, after hearing the Brachot from somebody who needs to make the Brachot. If no such person is around, then he lights without a Bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

Afra lepumayhu.</p>\n<p>(I could have thought that the word elohim refers to an angel, which is very apropos, considering he had just fought with the angel and with men (Lovon and Esov).

Perhaps these heretics don't believe in angels.</p>\n<p>It would seem to me that the posuk in Hoshea that Rashi brings, is more indicative of an angel. It says וישר אל מלאך ויוכל, which is an exact parallel of our posuk but replacing the word שרית for וישר which would seem to be the same word, as well as replacing elohim with hamalach.)</p>\n<p>Regardless, if the posuk truly does refer to God as the targum says, then I have two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is vatuchol (ותוכל)? Does that not denote victory? How could one be victorious against god?</li>\n<li>What does שרית mean? Translating it as \"wrestling\" is totally incompatible with god. The targum translates איתרברבת from the loshon of sorus (שרות) meaning lordship, grandness.  In short, where do they get soriso (שרית) meaning \"wrestling\"? Is it just a play on words? Ris-res.

The more difficult it was for a given person to learn His Torah, the more leniently that person must be judged.  Of course, this is a judgement that only He can ultimately make.</p>\n<p>And as for the comments of Rav Ovadaiah Yosef, zatzal, to which you made reference, to the effect that the possibility of repentance is a matter of mercy and this mercy is reserved for Jews, I think this must be a reference to non-Jews who could have learned Torah and served Him knowingly.</p>\n<p>But those who did not have such an opportunity, simple justice dictates dictates that they be held to a standard of behavior no higher than they could actually have maintained.

In that case, one's mitzvah of teshuva gains the absolute value of the sins one did. What you say he says non Jews get is just regular teshuva. Note that teshuva may be a mitzvah. As such, a non Jew can't get credit for performing it</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4134855/jewish/You-Will-Return-to-the-Lord-Your-G-d-The-Commandment-of-Teshuvah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4134855/jewish/You-Will-Return-to-the-Lord-Your-G-d-The-Commandment-of-Teshuvah.htm</a></p>\n<p>As for Yaaron Reuben, he is known to be a hothead and even Rambam is a bit of a maverick and not for the weak-minded. We'd need to read him very carefully if he says people go to gehinnom for mitzvot without specific intent to serve God. We say \"the ways of the Torah are pleasant\". If someone likes matza and eats more than the minimum for enjoyment, he goes to hell? Does Sugihara, a Buddhist, go to hell for saving Jews in the Holocaust without thinking about Hashem as he frantically wrote his visas and throwing them from the train?</p>\n<p>As for R' Tovia Singers assertion that people aren't punished for other's sins, he wants to disprove the notion that Jesus can't accept the sins of others. We know people do die for other's sins because of the plague that came when David counted the Jewish people or the descendants of Saul that the unrim vthumin said to hand over to the Gibeonites for execution because of a transgression of Saul.</p>\n<p>But it could be that my objections are wrong and God has the world set up in a way we perceive to be unfair.</p>\n\n\n",

If you can think of a \"bad\" thing that Hashem didn't ban, and are sure it's not a derivative of something else, then you can be sure that nobody would ever do that.</p>\n<p>Is there an actual source for this principle? I've heard it claimed in Chassidus that every sin will eventually be done by someone somewhere, who will do teshuva for it. Not that we can do sins in the first instance (lechatchila), although I haven't seen the source for it in depth.</p>\n<p>So, I would like any source, including the one I have heard from Chassidus, that anyone can find on this particular principle, please!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The gemoro in makkos brings the braisa. רצה הקבה לזכות את ישראל לפיכך הרבה להם תודה ומצוות Rashi explains that hashem forbade the eating of insects which a person has a natural aversion towards.

In the\nShu\"T Minhath Yishaq (8, 45) he expresses doubt over whether bekhorim\ncan make a siyum on the night of the 14th of Nissan (and see there\nwhere he raises difficulties against the Hawoth Yair), and his opinion\nis that seemingly a siyum cannot be done at the night, see there.</p>\n<p>In the pamphlet be-Yom Hathunatho (R. M. Gross, in Sha'ar Maamarim) he\ndraws on the sefer Shomer Emeth (Hilkhoth Lulabh ch. 669) a hint\nfavoring the notion of a se'udah during the day that is after a siyum,\none of the sources for a siyum masekheth is from the fact that the\n15th of Abh was rendered a day of joy and the Rashbam explains that on\nthat day they completed a great miswah, \"that he who increases\"\nexplains the Rashbam is one who adds from the night to a different\nday, thereby increases the days of his life, etc. Which is to say that\nit shows that the completion of the 'abhodah [of cutting the wood for\nthe mizbeah] was on the 14th, and by the 15th they were no longer\ncutting, the simhah was on the 15th, from here is a hint favoring the\nposition of the Hawoth Yair the also on the day after a siyum there is\na concept of se'udath miswah.</p>\n<p>In the Shu\"T Maharam Brisk (1, 133) he seeks to differentiate between\none who is mesayem himself from those that were merely with him at the\ntime of the se'udah. Which is to say that the mesayem himself when he\ncompletes the miswah he can rejoice at any moment and time of that day\nin which he completed the miswah and so anyway he can make the siyum\nat night. But those that didn't learn (rather they just joined\ntogether for the se'udah), they can join in on his joy in the\nhappiness of Torah (i.e. in the se'udah they are making to honor the\ncompletion of Torah and miswah) but they cannot thereby exempt\nthemselves from the obligation of Ta'anith Bekhoroth the next day. And\nsimilarly is brought down in the Shu\"T Shebhet ha-Qehati (4, 45) and\nin the sefer Yesode Yeshurun (6, p. 50).</p>\n<p>And I saw that it was written in the Shu\"T wa-Yebharekh Dawid (1, 24)\nthat if one completes a masekheth at night, he does not say Tahanun\nthe next day. And it proves that a siyum at night exempts the day. And\nsimilarly is brought in the sefer Abhodath Efraim (Ch. 12, Hilkhoth\nTahanun) and the author of the Shebhet ha-Qehati also notes this.</p>\n<p>The sefer Yuma Tabha le-Rabanan (6, 16) writes concerning this \"if one\ncompletes a masekheth on the night of the 14th, there are those that\nsay he is exempt from the fast during the following day and it even\nexempts those that partner together with him for the [se'udah of the]\nsiyum, and there are those that disagree, at a time of pressing need\nthe one who is mesayem himself is exempt but not those that partner\nwith him\", and similarly is written in the Nit'ei Gabhriel (Pesah,\nsec. 2 43, 15).

Then later, it is written in Shemos\n19:21, 'And the L-rd said to Moshe: Go, warn the people, lest they\nbreak through to gaze upon the L-rd,' which refers to a spiritual\nboundary, so they would not gaze with the eyes of their intellect\nthrough excessive investigation and inquiry.

I don't really have any friends in my community. I go alot to friends for Shabbat who don't live near by. And sleeping by them is not an option. My biggest problem is being alone on shabbat. Coming home after davening on Friday night. Is what gets to me the most. I would do kiddush and have my meal infront of the tv. And that keeps me sane. My plan for know is to leave the tv turned on for Friday night and have it turned off via timer Friday night. My question is would that still be considered shomer shabbat on some level ? Is this permissable?. Shabbat day is easier for me because its short and i can just rest in between going to shul. But Friday night is what is really difficult for me. In my shul their isn't too many guys my age where i can join for the meal and their not big on guest. No other shuls in my area that im comfortable with. My hope is one day i can afford to move to the neighborhood where i do have friends and can observe shabbat more properly & not be lonely. Thank you</p>\n\n\n",

This is the halakha only when these items are separated from the body, but when they are attached to the corpse they are all impure. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan teeth should transmit impurity because they are similar to bones, while according to Reish Lakish they should be included in the term “from any.”</p>\n<p>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Only items that are similar to a bone transmit impurity: Just as a bone is an item that was created with him at the time of birth, so too, all items that transmit impurity are those that were created with him, whereas teeth are not present at the time of birth. The Gemara asks: But are there not the cases of hair and nails, which were created with him, and yet the mishna states that they are ritually pure?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the Gemara continues with its <em>shakla v'tarya</em>, Rambam, Sefer Tahara, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Defilement_by_a_Corpse.3.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhos Tumas Meis 3:13</a> gives his <em>psak</em> as in the mishnah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every element of a corpse is impure with the exception of the teeth, the hair, and the nails, for they are replaced.

When a corpse is outside a house and his hair which is attached to his body is inside, everything in the house becomes impure. Similarly, one who touches hair, teeth, or nails while they are attached to a corpse becomes impure. When the hair of the deceased was ready to be cut or his nails were ready to be trimmed, their halachic status is in doubt because they are prepared to be cut off. Therefore, one who touches them is considered as ritually impure because of the doubt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, even if a nail is attached to a detached finger or hair attached to a part of a detached head, or a tooth to a jawbone - they transmit tumah upon touching as the limbs themselves transmit tumah.

He brings the example of יאר ה׳ פניו אליך, and how changing יאר to יער changes the meaning of the blessing to that of a curse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If they perform Birkat Kohanim, instead of saying יאר ה׳ פניו אליך (May the Lord shine his countenance upon you), they would say יער ה׳ פניו אליך (May the Lord arouse his face toward you), and this is the language of a curse. We see that the word פנים (face) can be conveyed as an expression of anger, as in פני ילכו (Exodus 33), and את פני (Leviticus 20), which Onkelos translates both as “my anger”. Thus, they turn alef into ayin, and blemish their prayers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi brings this one example, but are there any others?

I saw this originally in the halakha ubeagada of Rabbi Shalom Naki</p>\n<p>also, כל השונה הלכות meaning all who says at halachot will have a place in olam haba, is to be pronounced Shone and not sone, which means hate, \"All who hate halachot will have a place in olam haba\", very strange.</p>\n\n\n",

There are certain sages who hold that not every part of the Oral Law was given at Sinai (some were given in the Plains of Moab) so I assume that (at least according to these opinions) the word Sinai is used colloquially to really mean any time after the Exodus and before Moses died.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, using the phrase halacha l'Moshe m'Hashem would seem to me to be more accurate, and forcefully underlining that the Oral Law was equally transmitted by God to Moshe.</p>\n<p>Do any commentaries explain the phrase halacha l'Moshe mi'Sinai and specifically the emphasis on Sinai as opposed to Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Here is how Hakham José Faur explained it in the <a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/the-collected-works-of-hakham-dr-jose-faur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horizontal Society</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7AHGD82e.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7AHGD82e.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7o9LlO9e.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7o9LlO9e.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AJI5bjg8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AJI5bjg8.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the Gemara, rabbis try to find hints or references in the Torah to the specifics of a law. Sometimes there is a detail that is definitely part of the tradition but they can't find an allusion to it in the written Torah. It therefore must have been a standalone detail given to Moshe along with the things that are written in the Torah.</p>\n<p>We specifically say \"Sinai\" lest anyone come and say there were multiple revelations and that another prophet could come along with new laws.</p>\n\n\n",

They both are beautifully produced, clearly typeset, and have made significant efforts to correct many of the mistakes that crept up in older editions. I do not know if one is more accurate than the other but doubt it is meaningful.</p>\n<p>The Steinsaltz/Koren edition has a <em>biur</em> which explains complicated words and a very useful <em>piskei v'shitot</em> section which brings references to Shulchan Aruch (more rarely other texts, e.g., Aruch Hashulchan) and their <em>psakim</em>, sometimes references to the gemara. It includes the Raavad in normal-sized font as well. Each book is relatively thick and heavy but beautifully produced as everything Koren does.</p>\n<p>The Mifal Mishne Torah exists in \"brochure\" format which makes it easier to transport/learn during travel, has a similar section explaining unclear words, and its particularity is that it uses other locations in the Rambam to explain them (i.e., it uses the Rambam as a commentary on the Rambam).</p>\n<p>None of these editions bring the traditional commentaries, e.g., Kesef Mishne, Magid Mishne. As such they help understand the text but don't delve into its meaning.</p>\n<p>I personally prefer the Steinsaltz edition when learning at a desk (because of the additional halacha section) and the Mifal MT if I want to take it somewhere.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any Torah sources for raising children with a close relationship to grandparents?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I teach a class on chinuch habanim and would like to address this topic. Although I know there is tremendous value in general to children having a relationship with grandparents, I couldn't seem to find anything about it in Torah sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There's a lot to say about the relationship to Torah that a grandfather has to his grandchild...</p>\n<p>A grandfather is obligated to play a role in educating his grandson in Torah study. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.30a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 30a</a> relates how the grandfather of Zevulun ben Dan took pains to teach him halacha, gemara, mishnah, chumash and aggada. Such action is no small feat, and clearly underlines the importance attributed to a grandfather’s position in chinuch. Whilst learning in such depth with one’s grandson is perhaps harder to accomplish these days, every grandfather must endeavour to maintain an avid interest in their grandson’s talmud torah. This obligation is famously derived from the words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והודעתם לבניך ולבני בניך\"</p>\n<p>“You shall make them known to your sons <strong>and your grandsons</strong>” - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:9</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, such is this commitment to teaching Torah to one’s grandson, that chazal view it upon doing so, as if he had personally received the Torah from Har Sinai.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>This idea is illustrated beautifully by the following story related in the Yerushalmi Shabbos 1:2. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi had the practise to review everything that his grandson had learnt with him every erev Shabbos. One week he forgot his usual undertaking, and instead made his way to the bathhouse in preparation for the coming Shabbos. Upon his arrival he realised his mistake, and instead of washing, quickly clothed himself and returned to learn with his grandson. His student Rav Chiya, witnessed the turn of events and questioned his Rebbi’s actions. Previously they had learnt that if a person were to go to the bathhouse and undress, and then remembers that they have not yet davened, one does not need to don his clothes again. Rather one may bathe first and can then go to daven. If this is so, why did Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi feel the need to swiftly return to his grandson without having first bathed himself? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi duly responded that listening to the words of Torah from his grandson is like hearing it directly from Har Sinai.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Boruch Ber Lebowitz זצ\"ל sums up in a most clear-cut and succinct fashion. He notes authoritatively:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"שהחיוב הוא על כל איש ואיש מישראל לראות שבנו ובן בנו יהיו לתלמידי חכמים וגאונים בתורה שנאמר ושננתם לבניך\"</p>\n<p>“There is an obligation on each and every Jew to see that his son and his grandson become great Torah scholars as it says ‘And you shall teach it to your children’”.<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One cannot maintain a nonchalant approach to their children and grandchildren’s spiritual development. It is a task that lies with both a father <strong>and grandfather</strong> to ensure that their progeny are receiving a suitable and effective Torah education. Through the correct schooling and choice of yeshiva, a child will begin to start realising their potential.

    "content": "# Why do Jews believe Jesus was NOT the messiah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It's a known fact that Jews don't believe that Jesus was the messiah. The reason for this(as stated) in everywhere I searched are the prophecies in Jewish bible about the messiah that Jesus doesn't fit in. Reading the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_of_Jesus#Rejection_as_the_Jewish_messiah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Judaism affirms that Jesus did not fulfill the messianic prophecies by <br></p>\n<ol>\n<li>ushering in an era of universal peace (Isaiah 2:4),</li>\n<li>building the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26–28),</li>\n<li>and gathering all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5–6). <br></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Jews believe the Messiah will be a direct (blood) descendant of King David through Solomon on his father's side and will be born naturally to a husband and wife (Genesis 49:10, Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:17; Ezekiel 34:23–24).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's striking to me is that these verses, prophecies do NOT actually say that it would be messiah that would fulfill these phopecies. My reasoning are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While Isaiah 2:4 mention universal piece that would happen at some day, It doesn't say that this universal piece would be brought by Messiah. It says that God would bring it and there's no indication of Messiah doing this.</li>\n<li>Ezekiel 37:26–28 has the same problem. It's not saying that Messiah would build the temple. It says that God will make it such that people would have his sanctuary.</li>\n<li>Isaiah 43:5–6 again has the same problem. It's God that will bring people back to their land. It's not Messiah that would achieve that.</li>\n<li>Genesis 49:10 doesn't really say that messiah would be the descendant of King David.</li>\n<li>Isaiah 11:1 kind of talks about the shoot coming from Jesse's roots but where do you get the idea that this messiah would be born naturally to a husband/wife ?</li>\n<li>Jeremiah 23:5 has again the same problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So either I am reading these verses completely out of context or something might be wrong with my understanding. I'd appreciate if you can shed some light on each verse and why it's true what wikipedia is saying. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n",

The storm also delayed the boat’s arrival to Shabbat.</p>\n<p>On Shabbat, the boat crew constructed a new ladder using only the materials paid for by the passengers.</p>\n<p>What methods of disembarking may the Jew use?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I fear you've missed the point entirely here. The issue is <em>techum shabbos</em> -- how far you can travel (even by walking with nothing in your pockets) outside of a city.</p>\n<p>If at the start of Shabbos the ship was more than a mile from shore, then this Jewish fellow -- man, woman, ordained -- doesn't matter! -- then they're not allowed to disembark upon arrival. Even if the ladder was pre-set and all of that stuff.</p>\n<p>If there is absolutely no way to safely remain on the ship, then he should disembark and then remain in the nearest building for the rest of shabbos. Tel Aviv Airport is actually set up for exactly this scenario. (Well, a delayed flight rather than a ship, but the concepts are all the same.)</p>\n<p>If somehow the ship was traveling along a heavily-populated coastline and was very close to a city at the time shabbos started (or they arrived before shabbos started but somehow the crew to unload them didn't show up till after shabbos), then he or she may simply disembark using the ladder. The fact that the ladder wasn't available at the start of shabbos is a moot point. It may be <em>muktzeh</em>, but the prohibition of muktzeh is on <em>moving</em> items. And one would hope that the crew has secured this ladder quite well before any passengers climb down.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em><strong><em>In Yalkut Yosef</em> כרך א חלק א Page 323 it says:</strong></em>*</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a ship arrives at the port on Shabbat, if the ship was sailing above ten tefachim from the seabed, there is no issue of techum Shabbat. Therefore, when the ship arrives at the port, passengers are permitted to disembark on Shabbat using a ramp prepared for non-Jewish passengers. If the ship is anchored far from the port in open waters, it is permissible to transfer to shore via a small ferry, provided that most passengers on the ferry are non-Jews. However, one may not bring their personal belongings off the ship except through non-Jews, with the understanding that they will be compensated after Shabbat. If the ship sails within ten tefachim of the seabed for a distance of 960 meters, the passenger would have violated techum Shabbat, and they are prohibited from disembarking until Shabbat ends. The exception is if the ship continues sailing, in which case the passenger may disembark and remain within the port area. It is permissible to hand over one's passport to a non-Jewish official for stamping and permission to enter the port, as the non-Jew is performing the action for their own needs and as part of their regular job. Furthermore, the passenger would not be allowed to remain in the port area without having their passport stamped.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*It's important to note that in this halacha in Yalkut Yosef there is a very big footnote and over there he brings many other poskim who basically say the same.</p>\n<p>Therefore in this case, if the boat was truly over 10 tefachim above the sea bed there is no problem of techum Shabbat, and one can have a non-Jew take his stuff for him. If it's not 10 tefachim one would need to stay on the boat unless the ship is going to another destination.</p>\n<p><strong>If it is a cruise:</strong></p>\n<p>In most cruise ships, it is hard to disembark the ship without using a magnetic card, which makes leaving the ship and returning to Shabbat difficult. In any such case, it is necessary to know the details but I would assume that one can use a non-jew to swipe the magnetic card for him and if not swipe the card בשינוי.</p>\n<p><strong>With regards to the ladder that was built on Shabbat:</strong></p>\n<p>In Yalkut Yosef it says that as long as the ramp was prepared for non-Jewish passengers one can use it. I would assume that in this case, the ladder is not just being built for this Rabbi but also for all the passengers with him, and it would be allowed. If it was only built for him (which would seem very theoretical) that's a separate question, and I also don't understand how everyone else would get off as well.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps :)</p>\n\n\n",

However, I haven't found an explanation for why Hashem made the Teivah land on Mt.

Ararat could have been the tallest mountain, or that the Teivah happened to be in the general area. He seems dissatisfied with both explanations, and both seem to take the approach of \"it was the most convenient area to land\". However, my question still stands. Even if it was the most convenient, it still does not explain the significance of Mt. Ararat. This is a named mountain, if there was nothing to glean from the exact location/name, the Torah could have written \"a mountain\" or \"a tall mountain\".</p>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.96a.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 96a</a>) links Sancheriv to Mt.

Working on the assumption that building the Beit HaMikdash is a fulfillment of the biblical command leads to several questions in the text such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it was a biblical command why would David need to ask?</li>\n<li>Why would God answer that he cannot do it?

It should either be outdoors, or on the table?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Shabbos 21b) says that you must light your Chanukah menorah near the doorway of your house on the outside. If you live on an upper floor, you should light it in your window. And in times of danger, you light the menorah on your table.\nThere are many explanations why many don't light outdoors these days, along the lines that we still have the original enactment of \"times of danger\" (see Sefer Haitur, Shibolei Haleket & Aruch HaShulchan). Mishnah Berurah 671:38 writes that if one is lighting inside, it is more correct, where possible, to light by a window, to fulfill pirsumei nisa. However, if we are still concerned about sakanah we should light on the table. If we are not concerned, then why shouldn't one light outdoors.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Even though the <em>gemara</em> discussed lighting on one's table, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.671.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema to Orach Chaim 671:7</a> points out that the custom when lighting inside is still to light by the door (on the inside of the house) as was done when lighting outside.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.671.38?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 671:38</a> writes that if one is lighting inside, it is more correct, where possible, to light by a window, to fulfill <em>pirsumei nisa</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

I have not read the book, but have read various derivative works of his book.</p>\n<p>He claims that Shabbat observance was only practiced after the Babylonian exile, and not during/after the exodus. He brings examples such as Nechemia (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.13.15?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">15:22</a>) who observed that Jews didn't keep Shabbat. Or Yirmiyahu (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.17.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17:23</a>) where Jews would refuse to keep Shabbat. He claims that books written in the Temple periods there is no evidence of a weekly day of rest i.e., people go about their daily lives as normal, there is no preparation for Shabbat or observance of it, people aren't criticized for breaking Shabbat, and armies don't exploit the strategic weakness.</p>\n<p>I will note that generally the Torah itself mentions the six days of work before rest, motif. Gilad claims that this was inserted at a later stage, or simply never observed in the first place...</p>\n<p>He further claims that when prophets mention Shabbat it is regularly paired with ideas surrounding the new moon. He claims that in Babylonian \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar#Seven-day_week_and_Sabbath\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sabbatu</a>\" meant the day of the new moon. Gilad asserts that Jews practiced celebrations of the new moon (beginning of the month, rosh chodesh) and 'Shabbat' which was originally the <strong>middle</strong> of the month. Gilad then claims that only after the Babylonian exile did the monthly celebration transform into the weekly day of rest that it is today.</p>\n<p>Leaving aside the Babylonian claims (I am not asking about comparative religion or appropriation), is there any evidence in Jewish scriptures that 'Shabbat' can be understood as a monthly observance (or that there was an observance of something in the middle of the month), or a weekly day of rest but was generally not observed by the masses up until the Babylonian exile?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This sounds like another modern Academic theory that picks and chooses which parts of Tanach it wants to accept as true and reflective of their time and which parts are not. That type of motivated reasoning and special pleading can support any theory. It's silly.</p>\n<p>Yirmiyahu isn't post-exilic. It is prophecies from the end of the First Temple period.

This strongly indicates that Shabbos is a weekly event.</p>\n<p>There are also other places in Neviim that mention Shabbos without the chodesh. E.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.56.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 56:4</a>, 6; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.56.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Kings 16:18</a>.</p>\n<p>There is no reason to think Shabbos was ever anything but a weekly special day, just like it is today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't understand, because the Neviim were not criticising people for not keeping Shabbos, that means they didn't have Shabbos?<br />\nOr does he assume there were always Chilonim?</p>\n<p>Off the top of my head I know Shabbos is mentioned in Yeshayahu (not off the top of my head, it's perek 58), we learn things from there.</p>\n<p>But maybe that was added later?

    "content": "# Hot plate on Shabbos for Chazarah. Cover or no?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Based on my observations, there seems to be a general understanding that when people use a hot plate or platah for Chazarah on Shabbos, they place the pot directly onto the hotplate. However, when it comes to placing cold items on the hotplate, they tend to add an additional thicker layer instead of placing them directly on it. My question is: why is this the case?</p>\n<p>To elaborate, Chazal instructed us to perform Garuf Ukatum with fires prior to Shabbos to allow for Shehiya or Chazarah. The reasoning behind this is either related to the concern of Mechzei Kmevashel (it appears as though one is cooking) or the potential to stoke the fire. With a hotplate, while we are less concerned about stoking the fire, we still have concerns regarding Mechzei Kmevashel. (some do cook on hotplates regularly, and since the hotplate has the capability to cook, we treat it as an open flame) Therefore the hotplate would need to be covered.</p>\n<p>If we regard a hotplate as an open flame, then even performing Chazarah should present a concern, as it might still appear that cooking is underway. Conversely, if it does not appear that one is cooking—such as when one is holding the item the entire time—then what is the rationale for requiring Garuf Ukatum for Chazarah at a regular open fire? Additionally, if the hotplate is not considered an open fire and is already katum, why can’t we place items directly on the hotplate during Shabbos?</p>\n<p>How can these contradictions be reconciled?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One way to resolve the contradiction is to assume that returning an item that was previously on the fire (<em>hachzarah</em>) is forbidden (in general) due to a concern of stoking the coals, as opposed to placing an item initially on the fire (<em>hanachah</em>) which is additionally forbidden due to it looking like cooking.</p>\n<p>If we consider the <em>plata</em> to be like a <em>kirah ketumah</em>, we have eliminated the concern of stoking the coals, and therefore <em>hachzarah</em> is allowed. But placing cold food directly on the <em>plata</em> could still look like cooking, and therefore a genuine barrier is required between the <em>plata</em> and the cold food, so it no longer looks like cooking.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rabbeinu Bachya States That Jonah Curled up and Slept Soundly on the Tossing Ship Because he was Confident that he Would be Saved - How did he Know?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Jonah was told to go to Ninveh and proclaim judgement upon them. Instead, he attempted to flee on a boat to Tarshish. When a severe tempest threatened the ship, all the sailors prayed to their gods and then they proceeded to lighten the load. Jonah, however, went into the hold of the vessel where he lay down and fell asleep. The captain urged Jonah to call out to his God.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya (Kad Hakemach Kipuurim Aleph):</p>\n<p><strong>ויונה לא עשה כן</strong> אבל הצדיק עליו את הדין והיה בוטח בהקב\"ה שיצילהו כשם שהוא מציל את הצדיקים כמו שכתוב (תהלים לד) רבות רעות צדיק וגו':\nויונה ירד אל ירכתי הספינה וישכב וירדם זה מוכיח שלא היתה כונתו רעה כי היה שוכב ונרדם כמי שלבו בטוח ולא היה לו פחד כלל. <strong>Jonah did not do this (pray)</strong> because he accepted the judgment (against him) and was confident that God would save him in the manner that He saves the righteous as it states (Psalms 34): \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all...\" \"Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold of the vessel where he lay down and fell asleep.\" This proves that his (Jonah's) intention was not evil because he lied down and slept as one whose heart is confident, and he possessed no fear whatsoever...</p>\n<p><em>Question:\nHe accepted his fate, but why was he certain that it was a good fate - hadn't he just disobeyed God's command? His acts clearly caused the tempest! How did he know that death wasn't coming? And how did he know his fate was sealed (for good or bad)? The righteous pray and perform worthy acts until the very end precisely because they eschew the notion of 'one's fate being sealed.'</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The quoted text is from the paragraph 6 commenting on actions of Yonah. In the preceeding paragraphs Rabbeinu Bachya explains why Yonah acted this way and why he was at fault. To summarize, the intention of Yonah was not that a man can  run away from Hashem, because David already said in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.139.7-8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 139:7-8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where can I escape from Your spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I descend to Sheol, You are there too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rather he sought to run from Eretz Israel, where the spirit of prophecy is always present to Tarshish (Spain?), where the Glory of Hashem ('כבוד ה) is not revealed, so that he would no longer experience prophecy.</p>\n<p>Hashem made him a messenger. The fact that he refused to be the messenger, his thought was good and intention for the sake of Heaven, because of humility and wholeness of his heart. Yonah made <em>Kal vaChomer</em> to the words of Moshe rabbeinu. As Hashem sent Moshe to Pharaoh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 3:10</a>), Moshe also refused, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 4:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But he said, “Please, O my lord, make someone else Your agent.” (i.e. make someone else Your agent, Literally “send through whomever You will send.”)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, Yonah reasoned, if Moshe refused to be a messenger to take out Israel, the righteous, out of Mitzraim; so he, who was sent as a messenger to warn the evil-doers in Assyria - even more so was permitted to do.</p>\n<p>If one asks, if his intention was good, why was he punished that in the end he was sent into the sea? Rabbeinu Bachya answers, that Yonah refused to warn the evil people of Ninveh, which was a command of HKBH. <em>Because the righteous and the prophets are obligated by way of the Torah to warn the evil-doers</em>, as we find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.3.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 3:18-19</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I say to someone wicked, ‘You shall die,’ and you do not give warning—you do not speak to warn them of their wicked course in order to save their life—then that wicked one shall die for their own iniquity, while from you I will require a reckoning for their blood. But if you do warn someone wicked, and they do not turn back from their wickedness and their wicked course, they shall die for their iniquity, while you will have saved your own life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yonah refused, that's why he was punished. Even if one asks, Yechezkel was sent to warn Israel, but Yonah was sent to warn a foreign nation, whom Yonah was not obligated to warn. Even in this case, since Hashem said, \"Arise, go to Ninveh,...\", as a command, it means that Hashem hoped that they would repent, and as a result Yonah had to warn them. His refusal was equivalent that he was fit to demand their punishment, not for their honor, but for that of Hashem. That's a problem that Yonah had not yet understood. Thus, Rabbeinu Bachya concludes that <em>Yonah's refusal cannot be compared to that of Moshe, for Moshe was sent not to warn the evil Pharaoh, but to free Bnei Israel</em>.</p>\n<p>Hence, Yonah deserved punishment, however he had not yet realized it. Rabbeinu Bachya already showed, that Yonah acted on a faulty premise and has not yet realized his mistake. He thought that he could continue on the way to escape. That's why the captain of the ship, who was a very wise man, warned him in verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jonah.1.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yona 1:6</a>, as Rabbeinu Bachya explains this warning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why are you asleap as the one whose heart is confident and without fear? Even if you are confident in your righteousness, you are obligated to beseach for mercy and pray, 'rise and call your G-d'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The captain of the ship informed him that if one is in the midst of the trouble anywhere in this world, or the time of trouble came, one can save others and oneself with prayer, as the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.34.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 34:18</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They (the righteous) cry out, and Hashem hears, and saves them from all their troubles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, it is this advice of the captain that saved Yonah in this case. Because of his false premise, Yonah had not realized that death might be coming. As we know, Yonah was swallowed by the fish and spent 3 days inside the belly, bringing various reasons why he should be saved. Rabbeinu Bachya reads דגה meaning a dead fish. Only then Yonah realized his mistake, as we see from his prayer, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jonah.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yonah 2:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said: In my trouble I called to  G-D, Who answered me; From the <strong>belly of Sheol</strong> I cried out, And You heard my voice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What makes a good motivator?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any Torah sources for what would make something a good motivator for children? i.e. are there some that are more sustainable or more productive than others?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This answer applies mainly to older children/young adults who are more capable of reason, however it can apply to younger children as well. There are 2 parts.</p>\n<p>First off, The Mishna in Avos (4:2).</p>\n<p>בן עזאי אומר הוי רץ למצוה קלה ובורח מן העבירה שמצוה גוררת מצוה ועברה גוררת עברה ששכר מצוה מצוה ושכר עברה עברה</p>\n<p>Ben Azai says, “Run toward a light mitzvah and flee from an aveirah, for a mitzvah leads to a mitzvah, and an aveirah leads to an aveirah; for the reward of a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the reward of an aveirah is an aveirah.</p>\n<p>The idea of mitzvah goreres mitzvah is not merely some magical concept you learnt as a kid, it’s a fact of human nature and one of the greatest motivators.</p>\n<p>If someone does an act that appeals to his better self, he will immediately feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, thus causing him to want to experience that feeling again. The reason we fail to do what we truly want is due to fear, and this positive experience gives him the confidence to reach higher in spite of that fear. This is mitzvah goreres mitzvah on an adult level, and is why we “force” children to do certain things as part of chinuch; we shove a good feeling down their throat so they have the taste in their mouth.</p>\n<p>The second, and more important thing, is parents. I’m not going to list Torah sources for this because A) there aren’t any explicit ones that I can think off the top of my head, although there are countless ones by way of inference, and B) it’s purely common sense which is the best source.</p>\n<p>Parents are the greatest motivators. Not with what they tell their children to try to motivate them, but rather by how they act as people themselves.</p>\n<p>A child’s nature is to want to emulate his or her parents. Part of the reason we refer to Hashem as Avinu Malkeinu, is because those are the 2 ultimate beings that are naturally revered. A subject naturally reveres a king, and a child naturally reveres a parent. One might even say a child idolizes a parent.</p>\n<p>However, this natural state cannot be abused. If a parent lives a way of life that he or she is not proud of, the child will inevitably become aware of that fact whether consciously or not, and just like that there’s a crack in the child’s admiration of his parents. He’s no longer so confident that his daddy is “the man”. At that point the will to emulate his father starts to dissipate.</p>\n<p>It’s a difficult pill to swallow, but most of the time when our children are failing in an area, it’s our fault. Kids that are confident in their parents (who are confident in themselves) are nearly untouchable. You can’t shake them because they come home everyday to their “idol” who’s the man, and that’s who they emulate and they want nothing more than to make their father proud and be just like him.</p>\n<p>There’s no greater motivation for a child than giving them a true role model.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I saw once in a book on parenting advice pruned from the lectures of HaRav Pinchas Sheinberg Z'tl, where he recommended \"positive jealousy\". Instead of making examples of bad behaviour, make examples of good behaviour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>E.g. when one child does something very good, try to make the others \"jealous\" of how well that child did by letting them see how you praise and reward him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm sure this advice would raise some \"red flags\" by some people (generally, the ones who tend to use the phrase \"red flag\" a lot), but it's still better than shaming children who do badly, which is what most parents' natural instinct is to do.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the Scope of Rabbeinu Bachya's ואין לו לבקש סבה / to NOT Look for “Natural” Ways (to Survive/Escape)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya states in his intro to Parshat Miketz:</p>\n<p>השמיני הוא שיבטח בהקב\"ה בכל לבו ולא יתלה מחשבתו לסבה מן הסבות רק שירצה במה שהוא רצון הקב\"ה, כלומר במה שהוא בריא או חולה עשיר או עני חפשי או אסור בבית האסורים. וכיון שרצון הקב\"ה שיהיה לו אחד מן המאורעות והיסורין ההם והוא חפץ לדכאו בהם יש לו לחפוץ בזה ואין לו לבקש סבה, כי אם הוא משתדל ומבקש סבה שינצל מן המאורע ההוא שהוא בו, משים חלק אחד מלבו בבטחון אותה סבה ואיננו בוטח בהקב\"ה בטחון שלם בכל לבו, ומי שהוא שלם במדת הבטחון יש עליו לבטוח בהקב\"ה בכל לבו שהוא יתעלה בעל הסבות כולן יזמין אליו הסבות כפי מה שיצטרך.The eighth and final stage in his development is reached when he realizes that only G’d’s input determines his success or failure. He must learn to be happy with whatever G’d has decided should be his fate. He must give G’d credit for his health — or otherwise; he must give G’d all the credit for his wealth — or otherwise. He must appreciate that if G’d saw fit to subject him to trials and tribulations in his life on earth, that G’d had a benevolent purpose in all this, that He has his best interests at heart. G’d is equally active in protecting someone’s freedom or keeping him in jail. Seeing that G’d’s superior wisdom decrees if man is to undergo afflictions of one sort or another, it behooves man to accept such afflictions willingly. He is not to look for “natural” ways to escape such predicaments. If he does so, this demonstrates that his faith in God is not absolute, but that part of his being is still convinced that he can escape what is decreed for him.</p>\n<p>R\"B continues:</p>\n<p>ויראה לי כי מפני זה אמר (משלי ג) בטח אל ה', ולא אמר בה', לבאר שהבטחון השלם בכל לבו הוא שיהיו כל מחשבותיו אל ה', כענין שכתוב (תהילים כ״ה:ט״ו) עיני תמיד אל ה', ואין ראוי לו לצדיק השלם במדת הבטחון לבקש סבה, והעד על זה ענין אליהו, וכמו שהזכרתי בפרשה של מעלה (מלכים א י״ז:ו׳) והעורבים מביאים לו לחם ובשר בבקר וגו', והקב\"ה הזמין לו אותה סבה והוא לא בקש אותה, והנה זאת מדרגה עליונה מאד במדת הבטחון.<br />\nIt appears to me that when we keep in mind these comments of the author of חובת הלבבות, we can better appreciate why Solomon wrote in Proverbs 3,5: בטח אל ה' בכל לבך, “trust towards G’d with all your heart,” instead of writing בטח בה' בכל לבך, “trust in G’d with all your heart.” He wanted to alert us that a person who truly puts his faith in G’d is someone whose thoughts are oriented only towards G’d. Another example of such a construction is found in Psalms 25,15 עיני תמיד אל ה', “my eyes are ever toward G’d.” We have already mentioned that Elijah was a prime example of someone who did not try and survive by looking for logical means to do so, but that he took refuge in a place where there was no possible chance to find food and that he relied on G’d to provide it for him in His own way. This is the highest level of trust in G’d.</p>\n<p>והנה יוסף הצדיק הבוטח בהקב\"ה לפי שבקש משר המשקים שיהיה לו סבה שיצא מבית האסורים, לכך לא הגיע למדרגה זו של בטחון ונענש בזה\nBy asking the Chief of the butlers to intercede on his behalf, righteous Joseph demonstrated that he had not attained the level of trust in G’d which an Elijah demonstrated in his life. As a result Joseph was punished by having to stay in jail two years longer than had been decreed originally.</p>\n<p>*<em><em>Does he mean that ideally a person should not seek medical attention when they are sick? Physical or Emotional therapy?</em> Is it far from ideal to send a flare up into the sky when one is lost? Would Elijah have been guilty of seeking a natural means to survive had he hid in a more populous area where there is a greater chance of finding food? If someone steals from you why inform the authorities (trust in God's decree)? * <strong>Is the famous Two Boats and a Helicopter joke completely off mark (the punchline is that the departed man meets God and asks why He did not intervene. God responds that He sent all the would-be rescuers to the man's aid on the expectation he would accept the help)?</strong></em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it ok to say \"when Moshiach comes, we will find out who is right\" to someone of a different religion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The reason I ask is because it might come across as you are not sure about your Emunah, and it might be construed that you are saying their religion could be right.</p>\n<p>These might be problems. It might also be fine, especially in a proper context - fostering a goodwill conversation. As we know, it's not a good idea to back people into a wall, or tell them they are wrong. It's not conducive to a productive, open minded conversation, and risks turning things into a full blown debate (something we are known to avoid).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, here's an example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Rabbi and a Minister are on a panel discussing religion to the public. In order to not come across as closed minded, or arrogant, and to inject a bit of humour and goodwill, the Rabbi says \"...so, when the Messiah comes, if turns out to be your guy, I would happily admit I am wrong, and either way I'm sure we both look forward to the day when God's name is known by the whole world and we all have an opportunity to get close to Him\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>Edit: The reason why I think this is not opinion based is because I can imagine that there would be some halachot that would assist in giving a fact based answer. The only issue would be if those halachot could be interpreted in multiple ways without Rishonic or Acharonic support. </sup></p>\n<p><sup>Therefore, it would also be fact-based to bring examples. I could bring Ben Shapiro, for example, who said something very similar to what I wrote in the example above, when asked why he is not a Christian, at a talk at a university. He said effectively what <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/146658/is-it-ok-to-say-when-moshiach-comes-we-will-find-out-who-is-right-to-someone#comment491823_146658\">Shalom said in his comment below</a>, then added a throw away \"look, when Moshiach does come, we will see who is right, and if it wasn't me, I'll happily admit I was wrong\" (I'll try to find the exact quote)</sup></p>\n<p><sup>Is that a good precedent? He is a learned Jew, but perhaps we have higher calibre examples, or even good solid examples from some of the many recorded discussions and debates with non-Jews over the millenia? As Yaacov Deane said, this is important, and worthy of a round table discussion (you never know when you might end up in a discussion with non-Jews about religion afterall, it's best to go in with knowledge!)</sup></p>\n<p><sup>Given that there is a halacha tag, this already limits the question so people will not be on topic if they voice their personal opinions. I added the sources tag, and if anyone has any suggestions on tags to further limit it (should we make a maasim tag or is there one already?). </sup></p>\n<p><sup>Lastly, if anyone wishes to edit the question themselves to salvage it, feel free. I edited the example as well, to make it more hypothetical, as that will probably make the question easier to answer. Shkoyach</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Speaking commonly with a variety of abrahamic religious types is a norm for me. Typically we all believe in a coming or returning of a moshiach type. And Moshiach does commonly come up in conversation.\nI try to stay in the ‘He who comes will come for us all’ realm. The example between the rabbi and minister is great! I sometimes say ‘no matter the specifics of the who/where/when/how - I will still raise my voice in praise.</p>\n<p>Conceding to the unique correctness of HaShem is not an admission of incorrect belief. It is a show of faith.</p>\n<p>Jeremiah 18 is commonly used to end disputes as disputations are incorrect.</p>\n<p>Proverbs 18:6\nA fools lips enter into contention.\nProverbs 13:10\nOnly by pride cometh contention.</p>\n<p>In our own pride we believe we know. And after all - in the light of ‘Who is right?’ there is only 1 who is correct.</p>\n<p>Job 40 helps one see how to align correctly with this idea. Jeremiah 18 proves our need to be willing to be whatever HaShem desires us to be.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Haftarah at Shabbat Minchah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the book <em>A Voice Still Heard: The Sacred Songs of the Ashkenazic Jews</em> by Professor Eric Werner, I found this passage that does not match usual practice as I have seen it or as any of my siddurim have printed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The close organic intertwining — indeed the inseparability of musical and liturgical traditions in <em>minhag ashkenaz</em> — may be demonstrated with one telling instance: in the <em>minhah</em> service of the Sabbath there is a special passage called the <em>kedusha de-sidra</em> (beginning with the Words \"<em>u-va le-tziyon go'el</em>\" [a redeemer shall come to Zion] and continuing with a number of scriptural verses). According to a Gaonic principle this <em>kedusha de-sidra</em> was to be sung to a melody used by students when reciting the <em>sidrah</em> (Torah lesson). Elsewhere, in a rarely observed decree, R. Saadyah Gaon had listed all those scriptural verses in which the community is expected to join the reader of the lesson. Among the verses listed are those quoted in the <em>kedusha de-sidra</em>[15]. This is probably related to the fact that in the Sabbath <em>minhah</em> of <em>minhag ashkenaz</em> the cantillation of the <em>Haftarah</em> (Prophetic lesson) dominates the chant of the entire service. If this conjecture is valid, it should apply also to passages from the liturgy of public fast days, which surround the nucleus Exodus <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34:6-7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:11-14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34:1-10</a>. On those days, following Saadyah Gaon's prescribed list, Exodus <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34:6</a> are chanted by the entire congregation. When we turn to the actual chant (example 3) we discover that it is a direct derivative from the cantillation of the Prophetic lesson. There is also an additional prayer for these fast days (example 4), inserted into the thirteenth benediction of the <em>Amidah</em>, which is chanted in the same mode as the Sabbath <em>minhah</em> service.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JpnQ7Dr2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JpnQ7Dr2.jpg\" alt=\"Example 3\" /></a> <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tCGrvVly.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tCGrvVly.jpg\" alt=\"Example 4\" /></a>\n15. <em>Teshubot ha-Ge'onim</em>, ed. Harkavy (Berlin, 1887), no. 308, Hebrew text, p. 310. See also Rashi, in <em>Likkute ha-pardes</em> (Polna, 1813), p. 9, and <em>Geonica</em> (op. cit.), where one reads:\nבטעמן שהתינוקות קורין לפני רבן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is bothering me about the logic of this passage is \"in the Sabbath <em>minhah</em> of <em>minhag ashkenaz</em> the cantillation of the <em>Haftarah</em> (Prophetic lesson) dominates the chant of the entire service.\" I have never heard a Haftarah recited on Sabbath afternoon, or on any afternoon except for fast days. I am familiar with the new week's Torah reading at <em>minhah</em>, the transplanting of <em>kedusha de-sidra</em> from the morning to the afternoon, but it has not been the practice anywhere I have been to read a Haftarah at this point. I am not at all clear which Haftarah one would choose either. No siddurim I have checked mention a Haftarah here (for example Artscroll p. 512). I don't think this professor dreamed this occurance up, but I would be equally surprised if this was a custom that used to be done and has seemingly disappeared. Can anyone explain it?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In what way do שחוק and קלות ראש bring to ערוה?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Kitzur Shulchan Oruch, 29:6, we learn about the middos that a person should keep to. One of them is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Schok and kallus rosh bring a person to erva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is directed by the Kitzur Shulchan Oruch to regular people, in regular situations - nothing to do with interactions with women.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What classifies as \"kallus rosh\"?</li>\n<li>Whatever the answer might be, how the heck does that equal erva? Nothing to do with women!!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Possible source for question 1:<br />\nShulchan Oruch in Hilchos Nida, YD 195:1 says, one of the harchokos is that it is ossur to have schok and kallus rosh. The Shach (loc sit) explains:  <strong>\"Devorim hamargilim le'erva\"</strong>.<br />\nNow, there at least I can attempt to understand the connection to erva, being that a person has a strong relationship with his wife and during the days of tumah he is suppressing himself, some sort of lightheaded conduct might bring him to erva.\nBut... how would <em>that</em> translate to a case where no women are involved..?!)</p>\n<p>Even worse, the poskim there (YD 195:1) talk about all sorts of innocuous games like chess and ping-pong as examples of kallus rosh. I just thought that they are ignoring the explicit shach, who specifies \"Devorim hamargilim le'erva\". But now I see the shach is not qualifying which type of kallus rosh. The shach is just bringing the words of chazal, that ALL kallus rosh brings to erva.</p>\n<p>So bizarrely it would appear that if you join the dots, all these poskim would say that two friends playing chess are engaged in \"kallus rosh\", which ultimately will bring them both to erva!!</p>\n<p>How on earth do you explain this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Executive Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>שְׂחוֹק</strong> - being focused on non-productive activities,</li>\n<li><strong>וְקַלּוּת רֹאשׁ</strong> - or letting one's mind be filled with opinions without filtering the input,</li>\n<li><strong>מַרְגִּילִין לְעֶרְוָה</strong> - primes one to become more open to anti-Torah behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>The source of this \"suggestion\" of the Kitzur is in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.3.13?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 3:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא אוֹמֵר, שְׂחוֹק וְקַלּוּת רֹאשׁ, מַרְגִּילִין לְעֶרְוָה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before explaining what the words mean, let's use the approach of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.3.13?lang=he&with=Derekh%20Chayyim&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דרך החיים</a> to this Mishna, by looking at the previous Mishna:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל אוֹמֵר, הֱוֵי קַל לְרֹאשׁ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל is teaching us that when dealing with a \"senior\" - a רֹאשׁ - one should be easygoing, and open-minded when hearing their opinions. So קַל לְרֹאשׁ and קַלּוּת רֹאשׁ seem to mean allowing one's opinions to be influenced without critically analyzing their worth or truth.</p>\n<p>That's a good thing when dealing with a Torah personality. Otherwise it's highly troublesome.</p>\n<p>This is confirmed by the מסילת ישירים in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mesillat_Yesharim.5.16?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ch. 5</a> who explains that the opposite of זְּהִירוּת - controlling and being aware of one's thoughts - is קלות ראש which leads to שחוק and is a slippery slope which, when left unchecked, leads to promiscuity.</p>\n<p>As an added bonus we can use definitions of <em>the Jastrow</em> kindly provided by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.3.13?lang=he&with=Jastrow&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria in our Mishna</a>. Picking and choosing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>שְׂחוֹק: laughter, sport, jest ... the sport here mentioned means idolatry, debauchery, and bloodshed.</li>\n<li>קַלּוּת רֹאשׁ: light-mindedness, irreverence, disregard of custom.</li>\n<li>מַרְגִּילִין: to accustom one’s self, get used to, to bring about; cause.</li>\n<li>עֶרְוָה: nakedness, shame; unchastity, lewdness, obscenity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, putting all the above together the Kitzur or the Mishna seem to say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>שְׂחוֹק</strong> - being focused on non-productive activities,</li>\n<li><strong>וְקַלּוּת רֹאשׁ</strong> - or letting one's mind be filled with opinions without filtering the input,</li>\n<li><strong>מַרְגִּילִין לְעֶרְוָה</strong> - primes one to become more open to anti-Torah behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, this is individual.</p>\n<p>If you play chess to sharpen your analytical skills, that will help in your Talmud studies.<br/>\nIf you play chess as an excuse to be in a smoke-filled room with anti-Torah banter, the next step is to be invited to a backroom for some sinful behavior.</p>\n<p>If you play ping-pong as an elegant way to stay fit and improve your focus, that's going to help you become a better Jew.<br/>\nIf you play ping-pong as a way to impress young ladies, then מַרְגִּילִין לְעֶרְוָה is a good description of your next move.</p>\n<p>A similar approach can be made for using the internet:<br/>\nIf you use the internet for quick access to seemingly unlimited access to quality Torah, that's commendable.<br/>\nBut if you use the internet for quick access to free entertainment - שְׂחוֹק - or for accessing  opinions of people who do not need to account for their behavior nor source their opinions - קַלּוּת רֹאשׁ - then you're inching closer to ruining your life, as it says: מַרְגִּילִין לְעֶרְוָה</p>\n<p>And this is why the Kitzur uses רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא as a support for the previous admonition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>לֹא יְהֵא אָדָם בַּעַל שְׂחוֹק וּמַהֲתָלוֹת</strong>, וְלֹא עָצֵב וְאוֹנֵן אֶלָּא שָׂמֵחַ.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>A person should not be a jokester nor a prankster</strong>, nor sad and mournful; just be happy.</p>\n<p>Being a jokester or a prankster means you and your audience are being distracted from focusing on important things in life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, we are living in times where we cannot see how devastating playing chess is, to our <em>neshama</em>, due to <em>yeridat hadorot</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine a brand new, white garment: spotless and pristine. Even a single tiny stain on it is glaring and devastating. Now compare that to a garment already covered in mud and grime. Adding another smudge doesn't make much of a difference—it’s already dirty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe, in a sicha (I can't remember which, he has <a href=\"https://mafteiach.app/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">decades of sichot</a>), he paints a clear picture. The <em>dor hamidbar</em> were on such a holy level, that the idea of them speaking <em>lashon hara</em> in the way we do nowadays with slander, insults, and slurs, is unthinkable.</p>\n<p>So, when the Torah talks about the punishment for these people for speaking Lashon Hara (<em>tzara'at</em>, \"leprosy\"), the Torah says \"when a man {<em>adam</em>} has a discoloration on his skin he will be brought to the Aharon the Cohen... [Vayikra 13:2]\". The Rebbe points out that it uses the word \"<em>adam</em>\", which is indeed the highest complement Torah gives to man, describing him as a Godly being, similar (<em>adame</em>) to God. Such a being would never be nasty like this.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe concludes that the \"sin\" of Lashon Hara at the time of the <em>dor hamidbar</em> was for making frivolous speech. Nothing more. Not even a joke, just talking about empty, mundane matters. That's when they were given the \"<a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Rashi/Vayikra/14.34#m7e3n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reward</a>\" of <em>tzara'at</em> - an early warning sign that you are engaging in an activity that makes a small stain on your pristine soul. Keep up this activity and soon your whole soul will be black.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First you discuss empty matters.</li>\n<li>Then you make jokes about empty matters.</li>\n<li>Then you make jokes about holy matters.</li>\n<li>Then holy matters become a joke to you.</li>\n<li>Next thing you know, you are speaking nasty Lashon Hara so regularly that the Chafetz Chaim foundation needs to start a movement to simply get you to keep the most basic halachot of not being nasty in your speech about your fellow Jew.</li>\n<li>(and onward up to 365) All sins become permissable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Torah cares about you too much to lie to you. Even though playing chess is only 1 or 2 on the ladder, <em>it is a wrong ladder, every rung taking you one step closer to a nasty place</em>, leaving more and more muck on your boot, your hands, your clothes. The Torah cares about you too much to say \"it's ok to climb on steps 1 or 2 of the ladder, just don't go to steps 3 or 4 or 5\".</p>\n<p>Any steps on a filthy ladder is a sin to your pristine soul. Hashem doesn't let. The only reason contemporary <em>halacha</em>, and <em>eitza</em> from Rabbonim is permissive and allows us to play chess in moderation is because of <em>rachmanut</em> and acknowledgement of the reality of <em>yeridat hadorot</em>; we are already way above rung 5 on the ladder, and it's exhausting us. It's exhausting to be so filthy, and so disconnected from the true holiness inherent in our soul. It's a provision, a lesser-of-two-evils, a <em>bedi'eved heter</em>.</p>\n<p>Let them at least play chess a bit, to help them find the strength to work on climbing <em>down</em> the ladder.</p>\n<p>When we get lower, we will not find it so ridiculous - such a joke - that chess is an issue. We might actually start to agree with Hashem at that point*. May Moshiach come and teach us these amazing holy realities <em>bimhera beyamenu</em>. Until then play chess, in moderation, and think thoughts of Teshuva if you can.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Any sin becomes possible, including the extreme sins of <em>arayot</em>, once we climb the ladder of <em>letzanut</em> high enough, and every frivolity is a rung on this same ladder. We are just so high on that ladder in today's generation that we can't relate to that, but we must trust the wise words of the Torah, and try to climb down the ladder one step at a time.</p>\n<p><sup>* In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHFEp94v_xc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this video</a>, the Rabbi says a phrase about cell (mobile) phones that stuck with me: \"we get to the point of dependence on our phone for dopamine, that we can be literally sitting with our family, the people we love most in the world, but we have to pull out our phone  because it's not enough dopamine.\"... When stated so starkly, it's impossible to not realise that yes, we do have an issue. Why do we need chess? Surely there are much more fulfilling things to do with our precious time on earth... It may be hard to relate to, <em>but it's not a joke</em>. It's quite sad actually. Have <em>rachmanus</em> on your soul.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

What are the reasons for such a conclusion about the relation between <em>Megilas Antiochus</em> and the 1st and 2nd <em>Books of Maccabees</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>If you follow the footnote at the end of Wikipedia's statement, you'll reach the JVL's <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/scroll-of-antiochus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">entry</a> on the Scroll of Antiochus, which features a pretty standard description of the text and its development. The entry describes the mainstream view on the creation of the text.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>One can gather from the JVL's entry that the Books of Maccabees and the Scroll of Antiochus are unrelated for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Language:</strong> 1-2 Maccabees as we have them are written in Greek, while the scroll in Aramaic. Many believe that 1 Maccabees was originally written in Hebrew (but 2 Maccabees was indeed originally written in Greek). Either way, the three books do not share the same base language.</li>\n<li><strong>Dating:</strong> 1-2 Maccabees, as indicated both by the books themselves and by later authors who cited them (e.g. Josephus), as well as modern studies of the works, are believed to have been authored by people who lived in the time of the Maccabees/Chashmonaim, while the scroll, as indicated both by its mention of the destruction of the Mikdash and its usage of Western Middle Aramaic, as well as various traditions regarding its origins, is believed to have been authored by a person who lived ca. the 2nd-5th centuries CE (centuries after the time of the Chashmonaim).</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity with historical circumstances:</strong> Both books of Maccabees describe in detail various historic events that led to the Maccabean Revolt and the Jewish war against the Seleucids. The scroll, on the other hand, makes a small mention of Antiochus's megalomaniacal fantasies of conquering the whole world and quickly moves on to describing the defilement of the Mikdash and the killing of the Seleucid general Nicanor. According to the JVL, this indicates the author's ignorance of the real events that led to the revolt.</li>\n<li><strong>Nicanor:</strong> Both Maccabees and the scroll describe the killing of the Seleucid general <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicanor_(Seleucid_general)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nicanor</a>. But according to the JVL, the scroll's description followed the spirit of how the event was remembered by later generations, as the event that brought on the celebration of Yom Nicanor (13th of Adar; the Fast of Esther is a Geonic custom). 1-2 Maccabees, on the other hand, describe it from the POV of contemporaries or near-contemporaries, before the day became a longstanding traditional celebration.</li>\n<li><strong>The Miracle of the Oil:</strong> 1-2 Maccabees do not mention the miracle of the oil at all, while the scroll follows the known talmudic tradition that states that Chanukah was/is celebrated for 8 days because of that miracle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, though all three texts describe the same events, they were authored by different individuals, who lived in different periods, had different backgrounds and held different points of view and different interests. For these reasons, they should be considered unrelated.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> For other views, see <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/35121818/%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%92_%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A1_%D7%95%D7%94%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and other sources cited there; and <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/120087889/The_Aramaic_Scroll_of_Antiochus_Preliminary_Linguistic_Observations_in_Hebrew_\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for another view.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "“Worship” in Judaism?",
    "content": "# “Worship” in Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I wanted to know if the term “worship” has any special significance in Judaism or not and why, for instance, in the Orthodox Jewish Bible the word for “bow down” is selectively translated as “worship” when it is applied to God / a god / an idol, but literally as “bow down” when applied towards men. For example:</p>\n<p>Shemot 18:7</p>\n<p>And Moshe went out to meet his khoten, <strong>bowed low</strong> (וַיִּשְׁתַּ֙חוּ֙), and kissed him; and they asked each other of their shalom (welfare); and they came into the ohel.</p>\n<p>Compared with Shmuel Alef 15:31</p>\n<p>So Shmuel turned back after Sha’ul; and Sha’ul <strong>worshiped</strong> (וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ) Hashem.</p>\n<p>Is this purely a convention common in English translations of scripture, or is it understood that the act of bowing down when directed towards God is a fundamentally distinct action from bowing down towards men? And if the latter, why then does scripture use the same word for men to begin with? Is there perhaps a more reliable translation that you’d recommend than the OJB?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This question might need an expert in etymology to answer. Either way Shalom is right that that word means \"bow\", not worship, and עבד / פלח would be more commonly translated as \"worship\" in more authentic translations.</p>\n<p>But maybe there is no specific translation of this english word into Lashon Hakodesh, in the same way that there is no english word for the german word \"zeitgeist\".</p>\n<p>So, we should just look at how it is used in english. You'll note three predominant uses of the word in this <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=eff8027ae9e24998&q=worship&si=ACC90nypsxZVz3WGK63NbnSPlfCBuQvRS8T2XOvE5E4LemnLgPpoyOZsOoqPYKzKVaM8KEIhELMmRmdTEJ91dg9tbInV-3gxqA%3D%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAwYbLiM2KAxVdQEEAHQX-CNsQ2v4IegUIKRC_AQ&biw=1760&bih=841&dpr=1.09\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">google definition</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for a deity.</li>\n<li>religious rites or ceremonies, constituting a formal expression of reverence for a deity.</li>\n<li>great admiration or devotion shown towards a person or principle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do we have any of those in Hebrew?

It was merely that the angel caused him to be separated from impurity.\nWhat were the laws applying to him? He was forbidden to drink wine and cut his hair. He was, however, permitted to incur impurity due to contact with the dead. This concept is a halachah transmitted by the Oral Tradition.\"</p>\n<p>Question - to make the point that the angel separated him … why not just say  אֶלָּא הַמַּלְאָךְ הִפְרִישׁוֹ period. Or\nאֶלָּא הַמַּלְאָךְ הִפְרִישׁוֹ מן הדברים האסורים לנזיר. <strong>What's this business about טומאה?</strong></p>\n<p>The Rambam doesn't mean normative טומאה. Shimshon, per Chazal, was permitted tumas hameis. And the pasuk in his story that refers to 'Tumah' וְאַל־תֹּאכְלִ֖י כָּל־טָמֵֽא per Chazal was a prohibition directed at eating grapes and grape products - the things that he could not eat. It was not a reference to the prohibition of drinking wine or shaving. Drinking and shaving do not use the word Tumah - וְאַל־תִּשְׁתִּ֖י יַ֣יִן וְשֵׁכָ֑ר</p>\n<p><em>Yet the Rambam makes no mention of the one activity that the pasuk uses the word Tumah for - eating - in this הַמַּלְאָךְ הִפְרִישׁוֹ <em>מִן הַטֻּמְאָה</em> law!</em></p>\n<p><em>Rambam seems to see Tumah as a broad concept which encompasses everything that Shimshon could not do … seems to cover hair and eating prohibited grape products (even though he does not discuss this) and drinking wine. <strong>But how are any of these activities -  Tumah?</strong></em></p>\n<p>You might say that since the pasuk labels one (eating grape products) of the objects of these prohibited Shimshon activities as tamei, the Rambam saw fit to utilize the same term to cover several activities (although for some reason he left the main one out - eating). <strong>But this logic simply begs the question</strong>. <strong>Why did the Pasuk in Shoftim choose the word - טמא - for prohibited eating when the Torah in Nasa uses no such word for eating (see below)?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The whole idea seems counterintuitive. The elephant in the room. The normative Tumah that we are used to seeing isn't a problem for Shimshon, but somehow - via the pasuk narrowly (eating) and the Rambam more broadly (drinking and hair and eating (although he makes no mention of eating))- frame all this as 'Tumah.' Misnomer? What gives?</em></p>\n<p>In Parshat Nasa the Nazir prohibitions of eating and drinking and shaving are <strong>NOT</strong> framed in terms of Tumah:</p>\n<p>מִיַּ֤יִן וְשֵׁכָר֙ יַזִּ֔יר חֹ֥מֶץ יַ֛יִן וְחֹ֥מֶץ שֵׁכָ֖ר לֹ֣א יִשְׁתֶּ֑ה וְכׇל־מִשְׁרַ֤ת עֲנָבִים֙ לֹ֣א יִשְׁתֶּ֔ה וַעֲנָבִ֛ים לַחִ֥ים וִיבֵשִׁ֖ים לֹ֥א יֹאכֵֽל׃\nthey shall abstain from wine and any other intoxicant; they shall not drink vinegar of wine or of any other intoxicant, neither shall they drink anything in which grapes have been steeped, nor eat grapes fresh or dried.</p>\n<p>כׇּל־יְמֵי֙ נֶ֣דֶר נִזְר֔וֹ תַּ֖עַר לֹא־יַעֲבֹ֣ר עַל־רֹאשׁ֑וֹ עַד־מְלֹ֨את הַיָּמִ֜ם אֲשֶׁר־יַזִּ֤יר לַיהֹוָה֙ קָדֹ֣שׁ יִהְיֶ֔ה גַּדֵּ֥ל פֶּ֖רַע שְׂעַ֥ר רֹאשֽׁוֹ׃\nThroughout the term of their vow as nazirite, no razor shall touch their head; it shall remain consecrated until the completion of their term as nazirite of יהוה, the hair of their head being left to grow untrimmed.</p>\n<p>Only when we get to actual Tumas Meit do we see:</p>\n<p>לְאָבִ֣יו וּלְאִמּ֗וֹ לְאָחִיו֙ וּלְאַ֣חֹת֔וֹ לֹא־יִטַּמָּ֥א לָהֶ֖ם בְּמֹתָ֑ם כִּ֛י נֵ֥זֶר אֱלֹהָ֖יו עַל־רֹאשֽׁוֹ׃\nEven if their father or mother, or their brother or sister should die, they must not become defiled for any of them, since hair set apart for their God is upon their head:</p>\n<p>*<em>But,for Shimshon, as discussed, the proscription(s) are characterized as הִפְרִישׁוֹ <em>מִן הַטֻּמְאָה ... why?</em></em></p>\n<p>I am beginning to suspect that the Rambam's הַמַּלְאָךְ הִפְרִישׁוֹ <em>מִן הַטֻּמְאָה</em> might go beyond drinking wine and eating grapes and shaving ... it may even mean that God wanted Shimshon to see many things in terms of Tumah or Tahara and thus avoid Plishti women and saving himself with a jawbone for that very reason:</p>\n<p>Sota 9b:\n״וַיִּבְקַע אֱלֹהִים אֶת הַמַּכְתֵּשׁ אֲשֶׁר בַּלֶּחִי״. אָמַר רַבִּי יִצְחָק דְּבֵי רַבִּי אַמֵּי: הוּא אִיוָּה לְדָבָר טָמֵא — לְפִיכָךְ נִתְלוּ חַיָּיו בְּדָבָר טָמֵא.\nAfter Samson smote one thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey, he called the place Lehi, and God miraculously granted him to drink, as he was dying of thirst. The verse states: “But God cleaved the hollow place that is in Lehi, and out of there came water; and when he had drunk, his spirit came back, and he revived” (Judges 15:19). Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says: He desired something unclean, as he was driven by lust to Philistine women. Therefore, the saving of his life was dependent on something unclean, the jawbone of a donkey.</p>\n<p>=======</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>But we do find in Nasso that if he becomes tamei, it says <em>ki tamei nizro.</em> His <em>status</em> has been contaminated.

Some of the more evil  future kings like Herod were not even  Jewish. Furthermore Herod  wasn't even the king. He needed Roman approval for his actions (see Bava Basra 4A) Apparently killing most of the Torah scholars wasn't something Herod felt he needed Roman approval.

The book expounds the peirush on several aggados by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vilna Gaon</a>. (please see the book for many additional details)</p>\n<p>The discussion starts with the aggadeta <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhorot.8b.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechoros 8b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They (the Elders of Athens) said to him: Build us a house in the air of the world.

They asked him: Where is the center of the world? Rabbi Yehoshua raised his finger and said to them: Here. They said to him: And who says that you are correct? He said to them: <strong>Bring ropes and measure</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point here is that the existence of humans is tied to gradual recognition of G-d, as at the end of the days the world will be full of wisdom \"as water cover the sea\" (Yeshayahu 11:9). Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.97a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 97a-b</a> splits the timing of the history into 3 eras:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The school of Eliyahu taught: Six thousand years is the duration of the world. Two thousand of the six thousand years are characterized by chaos; two thousand years are characterized by Torah, from the era of the Patriarchs until the end of the mishnaic period; and two thousand years are the period of the coming of the Messiah. That is the course that history was to take, but due to our many sins, the Messiah did not come after four thousand years passed, and furthermore, the years that elapsed since then, which were to have been the messianic era, have elapsed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though the Jews had not merited the Moshiyach's coming, nevertheless the Era of Moshiyach arrived at its proper time. At \"the midpoint of the world\" G-d began turning the wheels of history to ensure the ultimate arrival of the scion of David.</p>\n<p>The connection to the question of the OP, comes with the help of the vision of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.13.8-9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariyah 13:8-9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the land — declares  G-D — Two-thirds shall perish, shall die,\nand one-third of it shall survive. That third I will put into the fire, And I will smelt them as one smelts silver And test them as one tests gold. They will invoke Me by name, And I will respond to them. I will declare, “You are My people,” And they will declare, “ The ETERNAL is our G-d!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This prophecy is a link between R' Yehoshua's idea to refute the words of the Elders of Athens and the words <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.8.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'muel B 8:2</a> noted by the OP as the significant part. To quote R' Feldman from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ultimate aim of G-d's judgement is not cruelty but bringing man to recognize Him and thereby gain eternal life. The recognition of G-d, then is the essence of human life and its consummation. During the first two-thirds of world history G-d waited for men to exercise free choice, to abolish evil from their live and reach the essence. When mankind as a whole failed, that essence was denied it and the Jewish people toook on the task. When they too failed, He withheld His revelation from them; He destroyed their land and sent them into exile. But in the last third - after 4000 years from the Creation - He manipulates history so as to give quintessential life even to those who do not deserve it. Even if the Jews do not choose to seek their G-d and recognize his rulership, he will nevertheless take them by the hand and lead them to this recognition. Worthy or not, they must be redeemed, or else the ultimate aim of Creation would never be realized.</p>\n<p>The ropes of David are the measure of human history. The two-thirds of world history which did not choose to recognize G-d's dominion refused to choose life. But the last third will be directed to the eternal life by a Providence which will lead the Jews step by step to the recognition of their G-d.</p>\n<p>What is the basis of your assertion, asked the Elders (of Athens) that \"here\", in the last third of human history, G-d's mercy is at work and we are in the era of Moshiyach? Rabbi Yehoshua answered, \"Remember the ropes of king David and you will learn the ways by which G-d directs His world.\" They teach us that G-d will never abandon His world, that ultimately the good for which  G-d created it will be realized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, David, as a prototypical Moshiyach, hinted in this punishment the ultimate punishment that Hashem will bring upon the world in exact form from every person, as stated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.13.8-9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariya</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is worthwhile mentioning that although, indeed, the מצודות translates חבל as rope, the רד\"ק brings the תרגום who translates חבל as “lots” (as in יעקב חבל נחלתו), which, of course, makes his action easier to understand. As to the lying on the floor, he did that as a way to disgrace them, as a punishment for having killed his father, mother and all his brothers. The מפרשים bring מדרשים that דוד wanted to punish the Moabites for a singularly vicious and vindictive crime which they had committed. When דוד was fleeing from שאול, he had asked the Moabite king to allow דוד’s parents and brothers to remain with him and be protected by him. Mindful of his own descent from מואב through his ancestress רות, he had thought that his family would be in safe hands. The Moabite king agreed to extend his protection to דוד's family but subsequently murdered them all with the exception of one of דוד's brothers who managed to escape. דוד, then, was avenging the murder of his family.</p>\n\n\n",

This Achimelech was ultimately slain by Doeg the Edomite at Shaul's command, along with the rest of the kohanim of Nov. His son was Evyatar, who joined David's side, until he was ousted by Shlomo for passing his allegiance to Adoniyahu. The second Achimelech was one of Evyatar's sons, and was very likely named after his grandfather. This interpretation was <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7350&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">presented as clear fact</a> by Rabbi Yitzchak Notovitz, a 19th-century expert on Gittin (for some information on him, see <a href=\"https://benyehuda.org/read/9654#:%7E:text=%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%95%2C%20%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7%20%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A5,%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91%D6%BC%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%A8%20%D7%91%D6%BC%D7%96%E2%80%99%D7%99%D7%98%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A8.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).

And/or, not really giving Mephiboshet anything new, other than meals by the king. Possible, but I would prefer to find an alternative explanation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Book of Shmuel, like pretty much the rest of Tanach, wasn't written in real-time (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.15a.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 15a indicates</a> that the book was written in stages). The title \"servant of the House of Shaul\" either refers to Tziva having been a former servant of that clan, or the title was given later, once he was commanded by David to serve Mefiboshet. Given the fact that: a. David decided to consult him regarding possible survivors of that clan, b. Tziva knew to give a detailed answer to the question, and c. David commanded him to return to his post as servant of the clan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.9.9-10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:9:9-10</a>), the former option is the most likely.</p>\n<p>Regarding the issue raised in your last paragraph, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.9.1?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim on Shmuel 2:9:1</a> asks how could it be that David, who was the son-in-law of Shaul (through his wife Michal, daughter of Shaul) and a former member of his household, plus best friend of Yonatan, did not know who in that family was still alive. His answer is that the other members of the clan went into hiding because they feared for their lives. They were afraid that David intended to do away with the entire rival household like other ancient (and frankly, modern) kings did (and do). This explains why David knew of Tziva but not of Mefiboshet's survival. Tziva was merely a servant and not important enough to be considered a serious contender for the crown. But Mefiboshet was certainly influential enough to pose a political threat to David. Interestingly Mefiboshet was actually found to be hiding in a prominent Gadite city, Lo-Davar,<sup>1</sup> hosted by Machir ben Amiel, who <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.17.27?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%A8%20%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">went on</a> to become one of David's allies.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Other than mentions in David's story, it was also prominent enough to be mentioned as part of the Gadite territory in Yehoshua 13:26 and as one of two prominent Transjordanian cities (re)conquered by the Kingdom of Israel, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_(%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A8_%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA)#:%7E:text=%5B4%5D-,%22%D7%9C%D6%B9%D7%90%20%D7%93%D6%B8%D7%91%D6%B8%D7%A8%22%20%D7%A0%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%AA%20%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%20%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%9E%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%A1%2C%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%97%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%9C,.,-%D7%96%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%5B\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">perhaps</a> around the time of Yerov'am II.

Purifying someone from the impurity of the dead is a 7-day process in which ashes of a Red Heifer and going to Mikva are necessary. So, it isn't really possible in our days.</p>\n<p>In regard to the scenario of the OP of a person who is an Av Hatuma (because he came in contact with the human of a dead person). The short answer, no, because at worst the olive oil became טמא but it cannot make the person eating it טמא because impurity within food or drinks cannot make a human טמא (Pesachim 14a).</p>\n<p>This is from a דאוריתא standpoint.

If a mourner, touched a dead person, or any utensil which touched the dead person, if s/he carried the dead body or a bier, if s/he leaned above any grave at the cemetery, such a mourner is <em>av hatum'ah</em>, <strong>AT</strong>. If he touches the bottle with olive oil - the bottle becomes <strong>rishon l'tum'ah</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, here's a difference regarding the bottle. If it is earthenware it becomes <em>Av hatum'ah</em> outside and as long as oil is inside and does not touch exterior which is hard to do, it remains pure (assuming it was tightly sealed if in the house where the corpse was). Glass bottle has the same law as an earthenware vessel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.30?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keilim 30:1</a>) rabbinically. If the oil touched outside it became rishon. However, a metal, wooden, or leather bottle becomes <em>av hatum'a</em> utensil, so that the oil inside becomes <em>rishon letumah</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 2:1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makhshirin.6.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machshirin 6:4</a>).</p>\n<p>If the oil is pure, the second person who consumes the oil is pure. If the oil is <em>rishon</em> the second person is really <em>sheini l'tum'ah</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 2:2</a>, halakha like R' Yehoshua), i.e.s/he does not convey tumah for <em>chulin</em> and <em>maaser</em>. For oil designated for <em>teruma</em> and <em>kodesh</em> he conveys <em>tumah</em> to make it <em>shelishi l'tum'ah</em>. His purification is the same as <em>rishon l'tumah</em> - in a <em>mikveh</em>, he becomes pure at sunset.</p>\n<p>B. A mourner, who was not in the house with dead body, did not touch any utensil which touched the dead person, if s/he did not carry the dead body or a bier, if s/he did not lean above any grave at the cemetery. If such a person did not touch anybody who was <strong>AT</strong> - s/he remains pure so the oil is pure so that the second person is pure. If s/he touched an <strong>AT</strong> person, s/he is *rishon l'tum'ah. If such a person did not go to a mikveh, the earthenware bottle and becomes rishon outside, same for glass derabannan. If the oil did not touch outside it remains pure and otherwise it's rishon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 2:1</a>).</p>\n<p>Metal, wooden, or leather bottle becomes rishon through and it makes oil inside rishon (all liquids if they touch sheini, etc. assume tum'ah <em>rishon</em> - (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 2:1</a>).</p>\n<p>Thus, as before, if the oil is pure, the second person remains pure.

    "content": "# Yeshiva style learning\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Firstly I want to clarify that this is NOT personal advice, so I will respect rule Number 1 of MY.\nWhat I expect is this becoming an information post with sources for people who may be on this same situation (I think there's no problem on doing this)</p>\n<p>So here's the question: How should one who never attended Yeshiva learn? i.e not what books or time schedule which has already been dealt with here <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66966/what-should-a-jew-learn-regularly\">What should a Jew learn regularly?</a> . What I’m referring to is actual enjoyment and commitment to Torah, especially for people who come from a not very frum background.\nFor those who say that Torah itself is the enjoyment I understand where you come from, as Koheles 11:7 says, that Torah is \"a sweet light\".\nHowever not everyone reaches this level, so does anyone have any source that deals with this? I think commitment is one of the keys to Torah learning.</p>\n<p>To be more precise as @shmosel noted, I'm not refering to seeing results which in cases like Halacha are pretty evident, I'm talking more in enjoying the study itself on subjects which may be not of the personal enjoyment of the talmid, i.e some gemara's maseches or learning gemara itself as learning alone makes it harder.</p>\n<p>As this is my second question I hope I didn't make any mistake. In case I did I’m more than happy to edit the post or do whatever Is necessary.\nThank y'all.</p>\n\n\n",

I am looking for a recommendation for a new mikraot gedolot with the following features.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Clear, easy to read font and format</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>All Hebrew</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Accurate</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No censorship (e.g. excluding Rashbam's comment in Bereshit about the day beginning in the morning rather than the evening)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Not too bulky to carry (comparable to Torat Chaim)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can anyone recommend an edition that fulfills those criteria?</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I can personally recommend Bar Ilan's Mikraot Gedolot. It has everything you can ask for, and unlike Artscroll, does <strong>not</strong> have a history of censorship. Here's a description of their work:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mikraot Gedolot HaKeter is a project of Bar-Ilan University, based\non the most accurate Bible manuscript, the Aleppo codex.</p>\n<p>Thousands of flaws of previous editions have been corrected. It\nincludes an apparatus called \"Ein Ha-Masorah\"' which makes the\nterminology of the Masorah readil comprehensible.</p>\n<p>The Aramaic targumim and commentaries are based on meticulous\ncomparison of the best extant manuscripts. It includes the most\ncomprehensive selection of medieval commentaries, which have been\nprinted in an easily readable Hebrew font and are clearly punctuated,\nsecuring its establishment as an indispensable study and research\ntool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They recently finished the complete Tanakh, and sell a more affordable small edition of it <a href=\"https://www.biupress.co.il/index.php?dir=site&page=catalog&op=category&cs=5286&language=eng\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm attaching a couple of pictures from their edition of Yechezkel, including extra material at the back of the book.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/65AU0tgB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/65AU0tgB.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L9NnAFdr.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L9NnAFdr.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FyeUrQtV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FyeUrQtV.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

(Which would mean you couldn't sell it.) There are very few categories of non-kosher that fall into this one, such as meat-cooked-in-milk. For stuff like pork rinds, a good Jewish boy isn't advised to get into the business of selling them, but if he got a case of them by mistake he'd be allowed to sell them -- thus, in a convenience store, most of what he's selling isn't particularly non-kosher, so not so much of an issue.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is if Jewish customers come in and try to buy something non-kosher, are you facilitating their sin.

First I would like to ask you to take a look at my website, particularly at my blog, Diary of a Sofer. I have digital pictures of many shailos that come up. Most days I see shailos, either in mezuzos, tefillin, or where mezuzos are put. Many of the shailos are in mezuzos that have been checked. Sometimes people have missed some pretty incredible things, as you will see if you follow my blog. If you have high quality mezuzos, and those mezuzos have been computer scanned, and they have been checked by a certified sofer, and you don't have any special problems with the writing, it is possible that you may do a fine job. There are two problems however, that I see. One, you may not know keses hasofer, and mishna berura on these inyonim. There are some central halachos that you need to know before you work with mezuzos, or you can end up posseling something, and never knowing it. If you are never planing on touching a knife or a pen, you certainly have less chance of messing up, but I couldn't recommend it unless you were familiar with the main halachos of stam. I don't mean you have to take a test on the halachos of how to make dio, but you should know what chok tochoks, sho ksidran, kiddush Hashem, mukaf gvil, and leshma are. I just can't believe that without knowing the basics of those halachos that mistakes won't be made. My website is mezuzadepot.com and you will see many shailos there. </p>\n\n\n",

As DoubleAA points out, none of these sources offer conclusive proof that this was the original reason, however, they do point very strongly in this direction.</p>\n\n<p>To quote the <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12634-reform-judaism-from-the-point-of-view-of-the-reform-jew\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Encyclopedia</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reform conceives of the destiny of Israel as not bound up in the return to Palestine, and as not involving national political restoration under a Messianic king with the Temple rebuilt and the sacrificial service reinstituted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reform synagogues are generally called \"temples\" after the Hamburg, precedent, probably to indicate that they take the place of the temple in Jerusalem, which Orthodoxy looks forward to as the to-be-restored sanctuary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Wikipedia (unsourced), in its article on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple\" rel=\"nofollow\">Third Temple</a>, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Furthermore, there is a Reform view that the shul or synagogue is a modern Temple; hence, \"Temple\" appears in numerous congregation names in Reform Judaism.

Orthodox Judaism considers this usage inappropriate, as it does not consider synagogues a replacement for the Temple in Jerusalem (there were local places of worship contemporaneous with the existence of the Temple, e.g. the one that can be seen at Masada).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1: In fact, many places online (including the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple#Role_in_Reform_and_Reconstructionist_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article on the Third Temple</a>) mention that an original Reform belief was that \"Berlin was the New Jerusalem\". I have been unable to chase the source of that idea down.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://congregations.urj.org/display.cfm?state=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">876 Reform congregations in North America</a>, <a href=\"http://congregations.urj.org/search.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">499 of which</a> have \"Temple\" in their names, so the formal name is pretty common and it's not unreasonable to think that people refer to the others as \"temples\" too.  As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25674/472\">noted by DoubleAA</a>, the first (apparent) use of the name was the Hamburg synagogue in 1818.  Documentation about naming practices that early is hard to come by, but we might find hints in the official \"platforms\" published by the Reform movement (as it formed into an actual movement). </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/platforms/declaration-principles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first of these</a>, from 1885, explains their views on Zionism and messianism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We recognize, in the modern era of universal culture of heart and intellect, the approaching of the realization of Israel's great Messianic hope for the establishment of the kingdom of truth, justice, and peace among all men. We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community, and therefore <strong>expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron</strong>, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning the Jewish state.\n  [...]\n  <strong>We are convinced of the utmost necessity of preserving the historical identity with our great past.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the combination of \"we're not anticipating a third temple\" and \"historical identity is important\" led to the name being considered appropriate.  Nearly a century later, the <a href=\"http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/platforms/reform-judaism-centenary-perspective/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1976 platform</a> said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are privileged to live in an extraordinary time, one in which a third Jewish commonwealth has been established in our people's ancient homeland. We are bound to that land and to the newly reborn State of Israel by innumerable religious and ethnic ties. [...]\n  <strong>At the same time that we consider the State of Israel vital to the welfare of Judaism everywhere, we reaffirm the mandate of our tradition to create strong Jewish communities wherever we live.</strong> A genuine Jewish life is possible in any land, each community developing its own particular character and determining its Jewish responsibilities. <strong>The foundation of Jewish community life is the synagogue.</strong> It leads us beyond itself to cooperate with other Jews, to share their concerns, and to assume leadership in communal affairs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The temple was the center of Jewish life in biblical times.  The Reform movement does not seek a third temple but believes that such centers of life are necessary everywhere that Jews live, and also that maintaining a connection with our national history and land is important.  One way to do that is to refer to those local centers as \"temples\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The short answer is: we don't know. The word Temple was first introduced in the title of the organazation which drove to found the Hamburg Temple: The New Isaelite Temple Association of Hamburg, a group of 66 layman (not the leading Reform Rabbis of the time) which arranged for the opening of the Hamburg Temple in 1818.</p>\n\n<p>You can read in <em>The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary Reader</em> (Mendez-Flohr and Reinharz, Oxford Univ. Press. 1995. page 161 <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=0Bu5GnLZCw0C&lpg=PA161&ots=N8rSAcFrAB&dq=hamburg%20temple&pg=PA161#v=onepage&q=hamburg%20temple&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>) parts of the constitution of that Temple, and while they are open about certain ideological and practical reforms they are making, they don't openly discuss their choice of names. To quote the first footnote to that text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some historians see an idological motive...behind the Reformers' naming their synagogue a \"temple.\" That is, that by adopting the designation traditionally reserved for the fallen Temple of Jerusalem, the Reformers symbolically relinquished the hope of Israel's restoration and declared Hamburg their Jerusalem. Other historians ascribe to the Refomers the more innocent motive of simply wishing to distinguish their house of worship from the traditional synagogue of Hamburg.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Certainly this fact was used by the Orthodox as something to complain about, but it's worth noting both that the initial Reformers' weren't as extreme as their followers became, and additionally synagogues have been traditionally identified as the modern analogue of the Temple as far back as the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megillah 29a</a>, based on <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1211.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ezekiel 11:16</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

We hold that hair of a married woman is 'Ervah (ערוה).  Yet it is not 'Ervah for an unmarried woman.  According to the <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=shabbos&daf=95a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Shabbath (Bab. 95a)</a>, braiding the hair is \"building\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2304/5323\">ממה נפשך</a> -- if it is part of the human body, why is braiding it \"building\"?</p>\n\n<p>If it is not part of the human body, how can it be 'Ervah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To answer a mistaken premise of the question -- <em>boneh</em> is possible on the human body.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=107&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 107a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המפיס מורסא בשבת אם לעשות לה פה חייב אם להוציא ממנה לחה פטור</p>\n  \n  <p>If someone pops a pimple on Shabbos -- if he did so to make an\n  opening, then he is liable for punishment; if he intended to remove\n  the pus from inside, he is not liable</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייב. משום בונה פתח או משום מתקן כלי מה לי לתקן מכה מה לי לתקן כלי</p>\n  \n  <p>He is liable: because of <em>boneh</em> or because of <em>metaken kli</em>\n  (fixing/creating a vessel); what does it matter if he fixed a <em>kli</em> or\n  a wound? (both are fixing things, and are therefore forbidden)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that <em>boneh</em> is possible on the human body, and thus the fact that <em>boneh</em> is possible doesn't detract at all from hair being a body-part.</p>\n\n<p>(<em>all translations mine</em>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hair is part of the body. The Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=6&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sukkah 6a</a>) calls it טפל לבשרו; secondary to the flesh, but clearly a legitimate part of the body, as it needs to be included in <em>tevila</em> (ibid).</p>\n\n<p>As to why @SethJ heard that a married woman's hair is ervah and not an unmarried woman's, the source that hair is ervah is Berachos 24a. The Mordechai there cites a Ra'avya (an opinion echoed by various rishonim) that things which in any particular society people are used to, do not retain the status of ervah, despite the Gemara naming them so. So it's really a case of the chicken and the egg; the single women do not uncover their hair because it isn't ervah; rather it isn't ervah because they uncover their hair.</p>\n\n<p>I fail to see how any of this would have bearing on Hilchos Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As explained in the Mishna Berurah siman 303 #82 the reason braiding hair would be Boneh rather than Oreig is specifically because it is attached to and part of the human body. This then would not be a contradiction to the fact that it is an erva, but rather a complimentary idea.</p>\n\n\n",

Are there any sources that discuss the reasons why He does so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Midrash Tanchuma (<a href=\"http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/tan/b0035.htm/#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naso:11</a>) brings three things Moshe could not understand; how the Jews can atone for themselves, how the Jew can provide \"food\" (לחמי) for G-d, and how they can build a Holy Temple where G-ds presence will rest.  To all of these things G-d replies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>איני מבקש לפי כחי, אלא לפי כחן</p>\n<p>\"I don't demand [of the Jews] according to My abilities, but rather according to their abilities\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which means on one hand that when G-d tests us He only gives us tests that we are able to overcome, but on the other hand these tests are indeed \"according to our abilities\".  (As chassidus explains in several places (For example <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/2/8c.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Maamar \"מים רבים\" by the Alter Rebbe </a>or a nice summary of it in  <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/1641405/jewish/The-Flood-Within.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article on Chabad.org</a>), this is in order to bring out our full potential).  So since our tests are meant to push us to our personal extreme, therefore to any individual person it makes sense that G-d's help seems to come at the last possible moment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I just finished reading Rabbi Benjamin Blech's book \"If G-d is Good, Why is the World So bad?\"  While I can't cite to any single page where he makes this point, a major theme of the book is that G-d granted us free will (Deut. 30:15-20).  To use his language, if he had not given us free will, and the ability to make our choices, we would be nothing but \"hand puppets.\"  But as Deuteronomy 30:15-20 states, G-d has placed on our table choices, good things and bad things, he gave us the tool to make proper choices (the Torah), and he urges us to choose good and life, rather than evil and death.  See also, Isaiah 45:7 (\"I make peace and create evil\").  </p>\n\n<p>Based on the above we see that the ability to overcome the evils in this world is within all of us.  It is not G-d that has waited until the last minute, but those among us who have just not realized that the power to overcome obstacles is already in their hand.  As we will read in this week's Torah portion, Beshalach, this is exactly what G-d told Moses when he and the people were faced with the Egyptian army behind them and the Sea before them.  Moses bowed in prayer after telling the people that G-d will fight for them.  But G-d tells Moses \"Why are you crying to me?  Speak to the children of Israel that they should go forward, and lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the Children of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry ground.\"  Exodus 14:13-16.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we learn in Esther that when Israel needs to be saved, G-d has emplaced several people with the capability to deliver us from the evils that would otherwise occur, but maybe for some reason, those individuals have not stood up to accept their role in history.  At Esther 4:13-14, Mordechai tells Esther that she has been ideally placed so she can help to deliver the Jews from Haman's plot, and that if she doesn't do it, deliverance will come from soneone else.</p>\n\n<p>G-d has already done His work to save us.  The trick is whether we can step up in a timely manner and do what we can to save our people.</p>\n\n\n",

If there are conflicting opinions on this, I would like to learn them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I would think this is the same question as identifying the Man on the throne in Shemos 24:10, \"“And they saw Elokei Yisrael, and under His Feet was something like sapir (sapphire or a blue marble) brick-work which was like the middle of heaven in purity.”</p>\n\n<p>What exactly did they see? We have a number of textual problems. Moshe later asked “Please show me your Kavod (Glory/Honor)\" (Ibid 33:18) and is told, “a person can not see Me and live.” (Ibid v. 30) But if our verse were describing a vision of Hashem, Moshe already saw Him so why the request? Additionally, of course, none of those who went up the mountain died because of the vision. Furthermore, at the conclusion of the Torah we are told that no prophet other than Moshe ever encountered Hashem “face to Face.” (Devarim 34:10) Therefore, we cannot understand this vision in a way that the others who shared it actually did have such an encounter, thereby contradicting an explicit statement in Devarim.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, there is a fundamental problem in Jewish thought with this reading: G-d has no body, no feet, no image to be seen.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that they saw something like the Ma’aseh HaMerkavah, the chariot that Yechezkel saw. “And above the firmament which was over [the chayos’] heads looked like sapir stone, the image of a throne; and on the image of a throne was an image that looked like a person upon it above it.” (Yechezqeil 1:26) And, in fact, Targum Onkelos on our verse inserts the word “yeqar” to say that they saw the “glory of the G-d of Israel”. This parallels Yechezkel’s description of seeing something that “looked like the image of Kevod Hashem, the glory of Hashem”. (Ibid v. 28)</p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Sa’adia Gaon (Emunos veDei'os 2:10), there is a kavod nivra – kavod as a created thing. The vision at Mount Sinai and that of Yechezkel were not of Hashem, as that is logically impossible. Rather, they saw this kavod. The Rambam’s approach is similar to Rav Saadia’s, except that he writes (Moreh Nevuchim 1:64) that the phrase “Kevod Hashem” is a synonym; it could refer to either Hashem Himself, in all His glory, or it could be used to refer to the kavod nivra. In our case, the text means that they saw the kavod nivra. However, in Moshe’s later request, he was asking to see Hashem Himself, which is why he was unable to have his desire granted.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Sa’adia Gaon writes that the shechinah is indeed part of the physical world, but that it is a kavod nivra. In fact, Rav Sa’adia Gaon holds that the term “shechinah” refers to any miraculous thing that reminds the viewer that Hashem is shochein beqirbo, dwelling with him. Thus, the pillars of fire and of cloud were the shechinah, as were the vision of Mount Sinai and of the Merkavah. Rav Sa’adia Gaon’s notion of kavod nivra can be a physical object. Therefore this vision could occur through regular, physical sight.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the Rambam’s opinion diverges. He holds (Ibid 2:6) that the kavod nivrah could only be seen prophetically. It is different in kind to the pillars of fire and of smoke, which were physical entities created miraculously.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban disagrees with both. In his commentary on the verse where Hashem promises Yaaqov that He will descend with him to Egypt (Bereishis 46:1), the Ramban says that “Sh-echinah” is a name of Hashem, not a created thing (nor a class of them). However, this does not mean that Mosheh and the elders actually saw Hashem in human form. The Ramban on our verse explains that the vision was prophetic. It would seem that in the Ramban’s view, a prophecy can be a vision of something that cannot truly exist.</p>\n\n<p>We find an instance of a similar debate in their understandings of the beginning of Parashas Vayeira. According to the Rambam, any narrative that involves people seeing mal’akhim must be the retelling of a prophecy. Mal’akhim do not have physical substance; they cannot be physically seen. Therefore, the Rambam holds that the parashah opens by telling us that Hashem visited Avraham, and then elaborates by telling us the substance of the visit, the prophecy that Avraham received. In other words, Avraham did not interrupt Hashem’s visit to welcome what he thought were three people. Rather, the visit itself was the vision in which Avraham hosted the three mal’akhim.11</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban takes issue with this understanding. After all, did these mal’akhim not then proceed to Sodom where they saved Lot? Was Lot not really saved? According to the Ramban, the story physically occurred. Avraham saw the mal’akhim in the regular sense, actually fed them food, etc…12</p>\n\n<p>What does the Rambam do with the Ramban’s question? The Abarbanel, in his commentary on the Moreh Nevuchim, writes that according to the Rambam, things seen in prophecy really occur. They are visions of events happening in higher planes of reality. The prophet’s mind and pen may make sense of the vision by interpreting its contents as things familiar from normal sensory experience, but the event seen is both non-physical and real. This is consistent with the Rambam’s position on our verse in Mishpatim. They saw something real. And since G-d does not have a body in any plane of existence, mot even a metaphysical “body”, their vision had to be of kevod Hashem, something created to be a metaphor for them to see.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban, on the other hand, understands prophecy to be the relaying of a message by the medium of a metaphor. The message relays a truth, but the vision is not of something real, it is a kind of communication. He, therefore, is not bothered by the idea that the metaphor they were given the message in was an anthropomorphic one, that of Hashem sitting on a throne.</p>\n\n<p>The common point, though, is that the description in the verse is a metaphor. Rav Sa’adia Gaon and the Rambam write that the metaphor was a created object for the prophet to experience. The Ramban says that it was revealed within their minds as a means to communicate deeper truths.</p>\n\n<p>So what did Daniel see? Either (Rashi / Ramban) a symbol G-d used to represent Himself in a message about the future, or (R Saadia Gaon / Rambam) the spiritual entity that is the Glory of G-d as it is causing the historical progression the prophet then tells us about.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/75991/jewish/Maimonides-His-Life-and-Works.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maimonides</a> (a foremost codifier of Jewish Law) in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">the first chapter</a> of his Laws of the Foundations of the Torah explains the concept of seeing a vision of G-d: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Behold, it is explicitly stated in the Torah and [the works of] the\n  prophets that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not [confined to] a body\n  or physical form . .

    "content": "# What happened to Tohorot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I understand it, all of Tohorot has been reduced, in modern practice, to Niddah and some hand washing. The entire structure of transmittable 'uncleanliness' is inoperative. Why is it inoperative? Because there's no Temple, and so no ashes of the parah, to get anyone into a definitively tahor state?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>It's actually almost entirely still operative. People and utensils transmit and accept impurity just like they always did. What has changed is a lack of impetus to purify one's self in most instances. There are essentially three ways of overcoming a given impurity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Metzora's Korbanot: A Metzora is impure and he can only become pure again by bringing certain Korbanot in the Beit haMikdash. This latter impurity is the one that is mostly inoperative because no one can become a Metzora without being declared such by a Kohen and this doesn't happen currently both because we aren't so sure who is a Kohen and because we aren't so sure what shades of white qualify.</p></li>\n<li><p>Parah Adummah (Red Heifer): One who became impure from a corpse can only become pure through being sprinkled with the ashes of the Red Heifer. We currently don't have any of those ashes available.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mikvah: This works on just about everything else and we still have it. In most cases though it isn't worth using as one will remain impure from the currently unsovable corpse impurity which we assume we all have (a pretty good assumption). It is still utilized to remove a category of impurities called Tumot HaYotz'ot MiGufan (impurities related to bodily discharges) which can be undesirable for other reasons (prohibition of sexual intercourse with a Niddah or Zavah, prohibition on entering the external parts of the Temple Mount for all (with possible exclusion of Keri), possible rabbinic prohibition on learning Torah/praying for a Baal Keri, rabbinic prohibition on Baal Keri Kohanim eating Challah of the Diaspora). Other than that, no one really minds remaining impure from most things, because going to a Mikvah won't change their status practically. (Technically there are different levels of Mikvahs for different things, but they are all possible nowadays.) Without being able to become fully pure and do things like eat Terumah and Challah, offer most Korbanot and enter the inner sections of the Temple Mount, most people are not careful about contracting most impurities. This is not a new phenomenon, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20280/759\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20280/759</a> for more.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The laws that accompany Taharot have a number of applications to other areas of Halacha. Sechach for instance can not be a vessel which would accept Tumah. Produce in Yerushalayim must come in contact with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/548/759\">a liquid</a> before having Maaser Sheni seperated from it. Kosher Mikvaot are needed for vessels bought from non-Jews (this is <em>not</em> an impurity concern). Hand washing before bread as you mentioned has some related concerns, including what amount of food requires washing. Male Kohanim are prohibited from contracting corpse-related impurity (this has lots of applications). There are likely some other small points which I am not thinking of now.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, by learning the Halachot of Taharot it should be considered as if we kept them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A large part of your answer is already suggested in the question - since the purification process for contact with a corpse is not possible nowadays. Another important point is that even in the time of the Temple, observing a state of purity was only required in order to eat sacrificial/holy foods, and since we don't have these it's not as important to remain ritually pure.</p>\n\n<p>[It's worth noting that even nowadays Cohanim do make sure not to become impure by coming in contact with dead].</p>\n\n\n",

What if you forgot until Shabbos had already started? Would splitting the pill be like grinding? If you pre-split some pills, what is the best way to find a whole and half pill from the bottle and avoid borer (the melacha of selecting)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchoso (Chapter 33:4) writes that it is permitted to cut a tablet into two equal halves in order to use only half.</p>\n\n<p>In the footnotes (footnote 30) he quotes this in the name of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and explains and there is not issue of the prohibition of \"Mechataich\" (measuring), because the Melocha of \"Mechataich\" only applies were he wants to use the cut item and not if he wishes to swallow it. In this regard, medicine is considered like food. Furthermore, since he is measuring not for the purpose of having a specific <em>size</em> tablet, but is rather concerned about the <em>volume</em>, this is not considered \"measuring\" in terms of \"Mechataich\".</p>\n\n<p>There would certainly not be any issue of \"Tochein\" here because \"<a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%AA_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%97%D7%9F#.D7.98.D7.95.D7.97.D7.9F_.D7.90.D7.97.D7.A8_.D7.98.D7.95.D7.97.D7.9F\">אין טוחן אחר טוחן</a>\" - there is no problem of grinding something that was already previously ground. </p>\n\n<p>However, if the tablet has words across - for example, the name of the medicine - breaking it in half may be an issue of \"Mocheik\" (erasing letters).</p>\n\n<p>Most probably there would be no problem of \"Borer\" in picking out the half tablets. Shulchan Aruch (OC 319:3) rules that \"Borer\" only applies when separating two different types of items, but not when picking from the same type. Big and small items of the same type are considered one type. [Regardless, as long as you pick out by hand the one you want for immediate consumption it is not a problem of Borer].</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, CYLOR for any matters of practical Halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

Did she convert? Did her conversion remove the stain of being a harlot from her (presumably because she is a new person)? Would she not be liable for punishment for her past sins? Would she have been able to marry any non-Kohen (a Kohen is prohibited from marrying any convert)?</p>\n\n<p>Note that I assume most of this question can be answered with a simple \"yes\", any convert can be fully integrated into Klal Yisrael, including marrying any non-Kohen, even known prostitutes. But I am asking mostly for certainty about a)that assumption and b)whether she in fact converted.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Gemara at Megillah 14b says that she converted, married Joshua, and that eight prophets who were also kohanim descended from her:  Neriyah, Baruch, Serayah, Machsiyah, Yirmeyahu, Chilkiyah, Chanma'el and Shalom.  According to the Gemara, Rachav and Joshua had no sons, but they did have daughters.  </p>\n\n<p>Given that history alone, the stain of her pre-conversion life was certainly erased.  But it would be anyway.  At Yevamos 48b, Rabbi Yossi is quoted as holding that a convert is like a new born baby and not held liable for his previous sins.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Presumably, Rachav repented before she converted. Perhaps this is supported by the Sifrei (on Parshas D'varim 1:24, § 22), which states that Rachav possessed <em>ruach hakodesh</em> at the time of the spies' visit to her home. Sincere repentance can effect major improvements in one's spiritual state in a very short period of time (Rambam, Hil. Teshuvah 7:7).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, as mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25754/1442\">Bruce's answer</a>, it is R' Yosi's opinion that conversion absolves the convert of heavenly punishment for past sins (see Yevamos 48b; Tos. Yeshanim, ad loc.) According to the gemara, Yehoshua married Rachav, which suggests that she was allowed to marry any non-Kohein (Megillah 14b).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Question on Terminology used in the Teaching of the Ari regarding Levels within the Highest Emanation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Otzrot Hayyim, Sha'ar Tant\"a (Ta'amim Nekudot Tagin Otiyot), in a description of Adam Kadmon, the first form taken by the line of light of the Infinite that enters the vacated space, it says that there are four aspects to the internal being of Adam Kadmon, refered to as 72/Av, 63/Sag, 45/Mah, and 52/Ban, or as Ta'amim, Nekudot, Tagin, Otiyot. It seems that each of the four is again divided into four sub-divisions to make 16 aspects. These are not fleshed out. But in the case of the one level (Sag/Nekudot) that is described in further detail, it is a sub-division into three that is described, with the three aspects referred to as ta'amim elyonim, emtsa'iyim, and tahtonim, i.e, the cantillation marks in a text of the Bible that have their place above the line, those that have their place in the middle of a line, and those that have their place below the line. Why the sub-division into three rather than four, when it seemed like the principle was that the structure would sub-divide into components that mirrored the whole? If there's no room for a fourth level in the representation based on the types of ta'amei ha-mikra then why is that representation used?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I do not have expertise in this area, but the following is my understanding of the topic as discussed in אוצרות חיים:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>n'kudos</em></a> we use naturally fit into three categories based on their placement. Likewise for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantillation\" rel=\"nofollow\">ta'amim</a>, the middle ones are identified <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31261&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">as follows</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הטעמים האמצעיים שבאמצע התיבה והם פס״ק ומק״ף כנודע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to refer to the <em>munach l'garmeih</em> (as well as the <em>shalsheles</em>) and the <em>sof pasuk</em> (where the word carries a <em>makaf</em>), respectively. In both cases the words are followed by symbols that are neither above nor below the letters, unlike all other <em>ta'amim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>After reading the section more carefully, it seems that the three divisions (upper, middle, and lower) of ע\"ב and ס\"ג are unrelated to what you call \"the four sub-divisions\" of each of the four expansions of HaShem's name. The three divisions of both ע\"ב and ס\"ג are mechanisms for filtering the Divine light, corresponding to figurative body parts of Adam Kadmon. The three divisions of ע\"ב correspond to the <em>ta'amim</em>. At this level, the Divine light is so sublime that it is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31261&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">impossible to discuss it or even conceive of it</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, R' Chaim Vital begins with a discussion of the three elements of the filtering process of the Divine light at the level of ס\"ג, corresponding to the three categories of <em>ta'amim</em> (even though overall it corresponds to the <em>n'kudos</em>) as well as the figurative ears, nose, and mouth of Adam Kadmon. R' Chaim Vital describes how the light is filtered through these elements and becomes progressively less intangible. </p>\n\n<p>The comparison of the ס\"ג expansion to the categorization of the <em>ta'amim</em> into upper, middle, and lower, is a means of characterizing the filtration of the light at that level. The fact that there are three categories seems to be incidental. By contrast, R' Chaim Vital mentions that each of the four expansions of HaShem's name contain elements of all four. The four aspects contained in each of the four expansions are ways of referring to different incarnations of the light at different levels, as opposed to the means by which the light is filtered. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does someone wanting to get married need to show an Orthodox ketubah from a maternal ancestor?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My friend is due to get married soon and has been asked by her Orthodox Rabbi to provide proof that she is jewish by showing that she is descended from jews.  She doesn't have her parents Ketubah so the Rabbi said that she could provide evidence that her maternal grandparents had a jewish wedding as evidence instead. </p>\n\n<p>She has looked and her grandparents seem to have been married by a Conservative Rabbi. Her Rabbi said that this wasn't good enough as the wedding had to be Orthodox to be accepted. Apparently this is also the view of the central beth din.  This means she can't have an Orthodox wedding according to at least one country's rules of Orthodox judaism. </p>\n\n<p>What I don't understand is that Conservative, Reform, Orthodox etc. judaism didn't exist as a concept before the 19th century so presumably if you look far back enough, all jews are descended from the same groups of people.  And it seems clear that if my friend could establish that her maternal great-grandmother, say, was Orthodox that would do no matter what her grandparents practised. So what is the distinction that today's Orthodox jews are trying to make? It doesn't make sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>Are Orthodox jews  worried that someone in her maternal ancestry might have converted to Conservative Judaism (see e.g. <a href=\"http://judaism.about.com/od/conversion/f/consconv_accept.htm\">http://judaism.about.com/od/conversion/f/consconv_accept.htm</a>) and so she would not count as a jew at all in their eyes if that had happened? Or are they worried that non-Orthodox Rabbis would allow intermarriage (see e.g. <a href=\"http://forward.com/articles/142112/conservative-synagogues-crack-open-door-to-interma/\">http://forward.com/articles/142112/conservative-synagogues-crack-open-door-to-interma/</a>) and so the wife might not have been jewish at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>If someone is born to a Jewish mother, regardless of her affiliation or observance, that person <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_jew#Halakhic_perspective\">is 100% Jewish</a> and allowed to marry another Jew. There is no conversion involved. I guess that this rabbi, in this situation, wants documentation that demonstrates that your friend's mother, and therefore your friend, is indeed Jewish. There are various ways this could be documented, one of which would be a ketuba produced by a previous rabbi who would likewise have checked. If the current rabbi trusts that the previous rabbi would have checked as a prerequesite to officiating, then he's all set. </p>\n\n<p>Without knowing the entirety of the situation, I can't tell why the rabbi wants this documentation in this case. However, I strongly suspect that he's not trying to prove that your friend's forebears were Orthodox, but that they were Jewish, with an Orthodox-produced ketuba being a potential method for this.</p>\n\n<p>There are various possible reasons why the current rabbi wouldn't consider a Conservative-produced ketuba, by itself, as proof that the participants were Jewish. As you suggest, he may be concerned about forebears who may have been born non-Jewish and converted according to Conservative standards, or he may just be concerned that the previous rabbi wouldn't have checked into the situation with the same rigor that he would.</p>\n\n<p>It would probably be worthwhile for your friend to discuss the particular situation in depth with the rabbi to discover what his particular concerns are and how they may be met.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>A Conservative kesuba can be suspect. As noted in Rabbi Emanuel Feldman's book, \"Tales Out of Shul,\" as a young Orthodox rabbi in Atlanta in the 1960s, he was under tremendous pressure by wealthy members to do a quicky conversion to the member's child's non-Jewish fiancee. He would refuse, and those members would leave the shul and join a Conservative shul, making large donations, and getting what they wanted. The result was that Jews were married to non-Jews who were not sincere converts. That is reason for great concern. </p>\n\n\n",

I'm not Jewish. I don't have a Jewish identity, and so I still have the identity of my own nation and family heritage. And I love literature, art, et cetera. But Germanic-magical, Christian, and/or anti-religious themes seem pervasive in the literature I enjoy. Is there anything from my culture that I can bring to God in my understanding of how He's revealed Himself to Israel, and yet also wants a connection, a level of holiness, with every nation He has created? I think that every part of life, the religious parts and all the other parts, exist equally in the context of creation and therefore of relationship with the Maker of what is in the world.</p>\n<p>2.) I'm currently doing an optional fourth year of undergraduate medieval studies. Previously, I was a committed Christian, because that's how I was raised. But lately I've been reading about Judaism, and also haven't really been reading medieval European literature. It's saturated in both Catholic devotion and in magical imagery. Part of me feels I should be able to read it without being affected, since I don't believe it. But, in another sense, I don't want to look at this kind of material. The reason I want to do this optional fourth year is because it will be a great opportunity to choose a topic related to Jewish literature in the Middle Ages. I'll be able to study the history of Jewish experience and faith. But doing so will surely include comparison with the surrounding non-Jewish literature. I have to make a decision about how open I'm willing to be about what I read and become desensitised towards, and know well whether that attitude comes from Biblical Judaism or from somewhere else. It could change my plans for this year. And it will probably affect my direction in the years after that, or at least the attitude with which I approach my studies.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/TU8_Schachter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">It's been censored from many recent history books</a>, but there were definitely personalities within the Mussar movement who believed in studying literature as a way of understanding (and thus improving) the human condition.</p>\n\n<p>You'll also find the intersection of Judaism and the humanities discussed at length by Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein (who holds a PhD in English Literature from Harvard and is considered a world expert on Milton).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question of the value of outside cultures and how they relate to Judaism is ancient.</p>\n<p>There are many passages in the Talmud that describe the beauty and wonders of Greek culture (which is a stand-in for secular culture in general), and many other that deride and criticize it.

For the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis [37:27]</a> declares, God will give beauty to Yefet, and will dwell in the tents of Shem. The Rabbis took Yefet to be Greece and Shem to be the Jews.</p>\n<p>\"The meaning, as they understood it, was that Greece had beautiful gifts to bestow upon the world - but these would be earthly, temporal, and secular as opposed to Godly and eternal. For spiritual sustenance one would have to look to the Torah, which would reside in the midst of Israel. But for other things one might indeed look toward Greece. Thus, while the Sages warned of the dangers of Hellenism  forbidding the study of its most vehement secularism and its paganism, they nevertheless esteemed Greek knowledge and information, and even imported many ideas, concepts, and vocabulary directly into the Mishna and Talmud!</p>\n<p>\"A more recent attempt at this type of synthesis is the philosophy known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah_Umadda\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Umadda</a>, which holds that: Jewishness and Jewish faith ... and the universal concerns and preoccupations of humanity are not fundamentally opposed; Judaism and wider secular culture and knowledge are part of one continuum Torah, faith, religious learning on one side and Madda, worldly knowledge, on the other, together offer us a more over-arching and truer vision than either one set alone.</p>\n<p>\"But this approach is far from universal. Many orthodox Jews have chosen to opt out of secular media and have nurtured instead Jewish sources of news and information. But for the rest of Jewish society  deeply embedded as it is in the information age  the walls are already down. Perhaps the best one can do is to remind oneself that secular media are just that. They cannot give us religious guidance, knowledge, or inspiration but - provided we steer clear of the crass, immoral, and blatantly decadent we probably stand to learn a thing or two. To be informed or not to be informed? Well perhaps, after all, that's too stark a choice:  it's how we choose to be informed that makes all the difference!\"</p>\n\n\n",

Why\n  should you destroy it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Torah is saying: Is a tree like a man? No!</p>\n\n<p>If so, why do we find that many commentaries try to find connections between man and trees?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rashi's understanding is only one, as Michoel said, of the \"70 faces of Torah\". The syntax of this <em>pasuq</em> is inherently ambiguous, and it is not clear whether the correct reading of the verse is as a rhetorical question or a statement. Ibn Ezra explains that the Torah is in fact equating people and trees:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולפי דעתי: שאין לנו צורך לכל זה וזה פירושו כי ממנו תאכל ואותו לא תכרות, כי האדם עץ השדה. \n  והטעם: כי חיי בן אדם הוא עץ השדה</p>\n  \n  <p>In my opinion, we don't need these or those [erroneous explanations of other commentators]. Rather, the [correct] explanation is, \"For you should eat from it, and not destroy it, because [as] a person is the tree of the field.\" Meaning, the lives of people are [as] trees of the field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regardless of which explanation holds more ground grammatically, the point remains: throughout TaNaKh, trees are powerful metaphors for righteous people, happiness, stability, and the Torah itself. As Shalom wrote, poetic/midrashic license allows us to read this (admittedly ambiguously phrased) <em>pasuq</em> in a way to derive meaning. See, for examples, some of the sources that Jeff Spitzer brings in his article <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Tu_Bishvat/Ideas_and_Beliefs/Rabbinic/Every_Person_is_a_Tree.shtml\">here</a>, including the Tzena uRena and the MaHaRaL of Prague.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The simple reading of the verse is, as you stated, the Torah is saying \"no it's not, so don't attack the trees.\"</p>\n\n<p>But because the Torah chose to word it in such a fashion, the commentaries saw that as poetic license to draw similarities between humans and trees. (But not in such a way as to violate the halachic interpretation of the verse, namely, don't cut down fruit trees when laying siege to a city.)</p>\n\n\n",

Topics have included Scripture (<em>parashas hashavua</em> or <em>Nach</em>), <em>hashkafa</em> (<em>Weltanschauung</em>), <em>halacha</em> (often related to the time of year), and others: basically most of the non-textual topics covered by men (who speak for men or for women or for mixed crowds). Occasionally they have been based on texts (usually excerpts photostatted and distributed) and covered <em>halacha</em> or similar topics more analytically, especially in more 'modern' synagogues.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't think I can do a survey and tell you what percentage of shuls have classes for women or classes that are open to men and women.  My Young Israel has both, and the classes for women are taught either by women or by our rav or another of our many local rabbis.</p>\n\n<p>I think whether or not a shul has classes for women, and the level that the class is taught at, depends upon supply and demand.  If there are many women in the shul who want to learn more -- especially those with a background themselves having gone to day school, or Stern College, and/or seminary in Israel, there is great demand and so long as there are  teachers who can teach the subject, synagogues respond to the demand and begin classes.  I have heard of shuls that only teach women courses on cooking, taharas mishpacha, and basic Shabbos in the kitchen halachas.  But there are so few examples of those that I've encountered, I'm more inclined that a majority do have at least classes open to men and women.  Some even have Talmud shiurim open to women, and these are not necessarily the \"modern\" shuls.  Rabbi Phillip Rabinowitz, zt'l, the Polish-born Orthodox rabbi who had received smicha at what is now called the Skokie Yeshiva, was the rabbi of Kesher Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C.  In the early- to mid-1970s, the congregation's membership was mostly older, less educated Jews, many of whom were not shomer Shabbos.  The baal t'shuva movement on campuses soon changed that for the better, but in the 70s, there was an Israeli woman who wanted to attend his Shabbos afternoon Talmud class but was reluctant to sit at the table with the men.  Instead, she sat in the back of the beis midrash.  Seeing her interest in learning, the Rabbi had his daughter sit in on all of the classes so that this women (and later others) would be comfortable.  A former neighbor of mine, a Holocaust survivor, had a similar story about her experiences in pre-war Poland.  She also stood at the door to hear the rav teach Gemara to the young men.  The rabbi saw that she was more attentive than the boys and probably retained more. From then on he had her sit next to him at all of the shiurim.</p>\n\n\n",

To quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ליל ט\"ו בשבט. מביאים כל מיני פירות, טריים ויבשים, המצויים בעיר, ומניחים על השולחן ועורכים מסיבה וקוראים על כל מין ומין מקרא, משנה ובו מספר פרי עץ הדר. וגם חל בשבת עושים את סדר ט\"ו בשבט ביום, מפני שבליל שבת אין רגילים לילך חוץ לביתם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that he is reporting that custom based on the local custom in Baghdad for Jews not to leave their homes at night.

First it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כָּל</strong> הַדּוֹר הַהוּא נֶאֶסְפוּ אֶל אֲבוֹתָיו</p>\n<p><strong>All</strong> that generation were gathered to their fathers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּקָם֩ דּ֨וֹר אַחֵ֜ר אַחֲרֵיהֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹא־יָֽדְעוּ֙ אֶת־יְקֹוָ֔ק וְגַם֙ אֶת־הַֽמַּעֲשֶׂ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה לְיִשְׂרָאֵֽל</p>\n<p>there arose another generation after them, who knew not the Lord nor the deed which He had done for Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A generation arose that did not know, but it doesn't say כָּל, all.</p>\n<p>It could be that most but not all did not know Hashem -- but you only need a few to preserve knowledge.  Or, as Hacham Gabriel points out in a comment, knowing Hashem isn't <em>strictly</em> necessary to know or follow (most) torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When it says that a new generation arose that did not know Gd and all that he did, it doesn't mean that the tradition was broken.  What it means is that the people did not have first-hand experience of the miracles.</p>\n\n<p>This allowed them to doubt the stories, and doubt the authority of the next generation since they didn't have these grand miracles to know themselves of Gd and Joshua's greatness. So Gd starts showing up to different Judges and giving each generation a new set of experiences so that they could know that Gd was still with them.</p>\n\n<p>You can see an example of this in our own time.  The 6 day war in 1967 was seen by everybody at the time as a huge miracle. Thousands of people made Aliyah only because of that war and the reclaiming of Jerusalem. Everyone felt, \"this is it!\".\nIt only took about 20 years for Aliyah to slow down and for people to no longer be impacted by the war. That's when saving Soviet Jewry became a thing and Operation Exodus.  Those were also impactful for the people during that time, but by the late 90s those great events were \"no longer known\" by the next generation, and they were looked at cynically and criticised.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, people know of te events if you quiz them on it, but for most, it's just not known anymore, the miraculous nature of those events is lost and religious impact is negligent for most.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the Source for Jerusalem and Sepphoris Having Larger Measuring Units?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Rabbi Pinchas Kehati's introduction to Masekhet Challah, and again in his commentary on Eduyyot 1:2, reference is made to the adjusting of measurements when the Jews \"arrived at\" Jerusalem, and again when they \"arrived at\" Sepphoris. In both instances, the measuring tools were increased in size by one sixth, such that the measurement for an <i>'omer</i> in the wilderness (given as 1/10th of an <i>ephah</i> in Exodus 16:36) required 1.5 <i>qavim</i> instead of 1.8, and subsequently 1.25.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing as neither masekhta (Challah nor Eduyyot) has gemara in the Bavli, and seeing as R' Kehati, in neither of these instances, has named his sources, can anybody please provide me with the origin of this tradition? Eduyyot 1:2 mentions the changing of the measurements, but it doesn't say where, and interpreting that mishna requires of us to suggest that it is speaking of the second adjustment and not the first.</p>\n\n<p>What is the origin of this tradition? Why did they change the measurements? And what does it mean when we speak of them \"arriving\" in Jerusalem and Sepphoris (Tzippori)?</p>\n\n<p>For those who are interested, and who don't otherwise have access to it, the following is R' Kehati's language (from the introduction to Challah):</p>\n\n<p>האיפה היא 18 קב, ונמצאת עיסת מדבר החייבת בחלה 1.8 קב. ברם, כשבאו לירושלים הגדילו את המידות בשישית, כלומר שכל מידה מדברית נעשתה 5/6 של המידה הירושלמית, ומכאן - \"עשירית האיפה\" במידה הירושלמית היא קב ומחצה... ומשהגדילו המידות פעם שנייה בצפורי, שהגדילו שם המידה הרושלמית בששית, אמרו חכמים: \"חמשת רבעים חייבים\", כלומר שעיסה העשויה מחמשת רבעי הקב קמח... חייבת בחלה</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Regarding the measurements, there is a long discussion in the Tlmud Bavli, <strong>Eruvin 83</strong>(p1-2). At the end (p2), the Talmud says that the <em>Challah</em> measure is 7 quarters of flour = 6 quarters of Jerusalem = 5 quarters of Sepphoris. </p>\n\n<p>Notice that the Talmud doesn't say here anything about the reasons or the meaning.</p>\n\n<p>תנו רבנן (במדבר טו) ראשית עריסותיכם כדי עיסותיכם וכמה עיסותיכם כדי עיסת המדבר וכמה עיסת המדבר דכתיב (שמות טז) והעומר עשירית האיפה הוא מכאן אמרו <strong>ז' רבעים קמח ועוד חייבת בחלה שהן ו' של ירושלמית שהן ה' של ציפורי</strong> מכאן אמרו האוכל כמדה זו ה\"ז בריא ומבורך יתר על כן רעבתן פחות מכאן מקולקל במעיו</p>\n\n<p>(תלמוד בבלי, עירובין דף פ\"ג ע\"א-ע\"ב) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I seem to have hit something of a brick wall with this, though may have enough information now to tentatively answer my own question. It seems that this phenomenon is alluded to in a number of places: in addition to those I mentioned in the question, mChallah 2:6, bEruvin 83a-b (thanks, Moti, for your <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/25836/adjusting-measurements/25913#25913\">answer</a>), bShabbat 15a, bShabbat 76b, bPesachim 48b, etc. In addition to that, the three commentaries that have been of the most assistance in tracking down the earliest form of this tradition are Tosafot (Eruvin 83b, s.v. שבעת רבעים), Tosafot Yom-Tov (Challah 1:4, s.v. ופחות מחמשת רבעים) and the Kessef Mishna (MT, Hilkhot Bikkurim 6:15). Those who are interested in following this further should look at those.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I've looked at each of these passages, it seems to me that the oldest text amongst them is the beraita in Eruvin 83a (my translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר סאה ירושלמית יתירה על מדברית שתות ושל צפורית יתירה על ירושלמית\n  שתות נמצאת של צפורית יתירה על מדברית שליש</p>\n  \n  <p>The rabbis taught: A <i>seah</i> in Jerusalem is one sixth larger\n  than a wilderness [<i>seah</i>], and [a <i>seah</i>] of Sepphoris is\n  one sixth larger than a Jerusalem [<i>seah</i>], meaning that [a\n  <i>seah</i>] of Sepphoris is one third larger than a wilderness\n  [<i>seah</i>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that this beraita is <i>not</i> mentioned in Sifrei on Bemidbar 15, nor in the Mekhilta on Shemot 16. Those two texts both appear to assume that there is one standard measurement for measuring out an <i>'omer</i>, and show no awareness of the differences between Jerusalem and Sepphoris. If this beraita has a source elsewhere in the midrash halakha, or even in the Tosefta, I don't know what it is.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the reason?  <strong>So that they should never rise again from their fall.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Aside: Somewhere, though I couldn't find the source, the Ritva says that \"this shira\" means \"all shirot that are not about praise\" so that it includes Shirat Moshe in Haazinu.)</p>\n\n<p>Rashi there says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‫ שלא תהא להם תקומה - שלא יהא להם מקום להרחיב צעדיו תחתיו:‬</p>\n  \n  <p>So that they should never rise - There is no place to expand their footsteps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But that doesn't answer why for the good shirot.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal explains in his commentary there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‫וזה כמו שאמרנו: <strong>כי גברו ישראל והתפשט כח שלהם ביותר. ולכך השירה הזאת היא אריח על גבי לבינה כי זה מורה התפשטות לפי שהם מונחים בענין שיש להרחיב תמיד. וכך כאשר ישראל מקבלים שלימות אין זה הוא התכלית שאי אפשר שיהיה עוד רק הם מוכנים להיות להם יותר שלימות.</strong> אבל השירה הזאת היא אריח על גבי אריח כי השירה הזאת בשביל שהפיל שונאיהן שלא היה לו תקומה כלל. וזהו נפילה גמורה שהגיע למפלתן של רשעים.‬</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is like we said: <strong>that Israel became mighty and their strength spread out.

And thus as Israel attains perfection, there isn't this idea that it is impossible to be more than just what they are.  They are prepared to be more perfect.</strong>  But this song is written half-brick on half-brick because this song is for the sake of the falling of its enemies that don't have a way to ascend at all.  And this is the complete descent which is the downfall of the wicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken together, the Maharal and Rashi seem to me to picture the \"half-brick over brick\" style as a staircase or lattice-work you can climb to greatness, whereas the \"half-brick over half-brick\" style is a pit without a path up.</p>\n\n\n",

And God saw that it was good.</p>\n  \n  <p>26 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness,\n  so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the\n  sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the\n  creatures that move along the ground.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So according to bible, birds are created before land animals (like reptiles). Science says that reptiles are are around before birds. Birds evolve out of reptiles.</p>\n\n<p>How do we reconcile this?</p>\n\n<p>I could match that ground animals mean mammals but that's pretty much stretching it. I could think that fish indeed show up first, and they are keep evolving even after the animals are being created. However, birds are descendants of ground reptiles. </p>\n\n<p>So science says the sequence seems to be</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>fishes</li>\n<li>reptiles (including ground reptiles)</li>\n<li>birds</li>\n<li>mammals</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>while Genesis says the sequence is</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>fishes and birds (day 5)</li>\n<li>ground reptiles and mammals</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hmm... almost a match but not quite.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This question was the root of an argument between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Schroeder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Gerald Schroeder</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natan_Slifkin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Natan Slifkin</a>.

Rabbi Slifkin instead proposed (in The Science of Torah, later revised into <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9652295949\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Challenge of Creation</a>) that the order of the days of creation is not meant to be taken as an actual chronological order, and that the Torah is merely just referring to \"powers\" of creation.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Slifkin's approach sparked a raging debate in the Orthodox world, which I don't want to get into but am only mentioning as a way of pointing out that his approach was not by any means universally accepted.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Rambam says that the details of the chapter of the Creation (I suppose, Gen. 1 and 2) should not be taught to the masses lest they misunderstand or twist what it means (Guide to the Perplexed, 2:17). An implication may perhaps be drawn that the literal reading is not all that there is to the story of Creation and that, perhaps, it should not be taken as literal 24 hour days. It may not be discussing chronological order of physical creation but rather a more mystical discussion of the order of potential for creation. Some commentators say that the potential for everything was created in the six days, but it wasn't  until the events in Genesis 2 that their reality was realized. And that reality might have been realized in a nature-veiled setting of 4.5 billion years of Earth, from guiding conditions for the first life to form until the desired present-day beings exist, all from a seemingly natural history.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Who says they must be reconciled?</p>\n\n<p>God can create a one day old tree with rings.</p>\n\n<p>Or stars millions of light years away with the light reaching here immediately.</p>\n\n<p>also, evolution is just a theory. in my opinion it takes ALOT of FAITH to believe that life forms can evolve from inorganic molecules.</p>\n\n<p>consider a upgrading windows XP to windows 8, something far less complex than upgrading a fish to the simplest flying bird or a three chambered heart to a four chambered heart. now type some random letters in the windows XP code.\nIs it possible that through trial and error you can upgrade the code? remember evolution must be advantageous each tiny step.

After sometime however I've been participating in the sabbath and tithing which is quite new to me and I don't feel that the connection everybody has when reading the torah in Hebrew and its prayers (mostly because I don't understand it). If sabbath gives a person energy to last a week, is it selfish that I asked for it and where does the energy come into play? If I also tithe, I know the 10% was going to be taken regardless but I have the ability to put it in a good place (Centre or not) instead of it being taken from my assets that I own if I used the tithe to buy something with it. I recently had an expense that I owe that will take most of my funds, do I still try to tithe the 10%?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You are asking various questions in the body of the text which is unrelated to your title question: If I study Kabbalah at a place called Kabbalah Centre am I jewish?</p>\n\n<p>To start with that question, only through conversion can one become Jewish. Conversion is a long process that eventually requires commitment to following Jewish law (called halakha), circumcision (for men), and immersion in a kosher mikveh (ritual bath). More information can be found <a href=\"http://www.judaismconversion.org/\">here</a>. Attending and/or participating in any organization does not equate to being Jewish. </p>\n\n<p>I question the premise of your other questions. The laws of the Sabbath and tithing are explicitly for Jews to follow, and so I don't see the applicability of the questions you asked. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I think it should be noted that the Kabbalah Center has been seriously frowned upon by many Jewish authorities (I don't think there is a single authority from traditional/orthodox Judaism that approves of the organization). There are many deeply ethical problems the Center commits - from the financial (tax evasion and excessive profitting of religious and pseudo-religious (\"holy\" water, red strings) merchandise) to the much more serious violations of misrepresenting Judaism by exploiting Jewish mysticism. For more information on why the Kabbalah Center does not represent Judaism, see <a href=\"http://freedomofmind.com/Info/TheTruthAbouttheKabbalahCentre.php\">The Truth about the Kabbalah Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/ss/Learning_Kabbalah.html\">Jewish Introduction on learning Kabbalah</a> for starters. </p>\n\n\n",

The Beis Din does not remind the convert, as is normally done, that this is his last chance to change his mind and not become a Jew, as we are already assuming that he is a Jew, and the conversion is \"just in case.\"  In the conversion which I witnessed, they did not inform him about mitzvos kalos v'chamuros (some \"light\" and some \"serious\" mitzvos), for what I assume was the same reason - because we don't want to and aren't trying to scare him/her off.</p>\n\n<p>Normally, a convert makes a blessing on going to <em>mikvah</em>, and a shehecheyanu.  The giyur l'chumra convert makes neither of these blessings, although I suppose it couldn't hurt for him to bring a new fruit with him and just have it in mind.</p>\n\n<p>The convert was not asked to choose a name for himself, as normally converts do take a name upon conversion.

I say \"what I think was\" because the rabbi who referred me to the Beit Din told me that it was a giur l'chumrah. I don't remember the Beit Din saying anything about that though. </p>\n\n<p>The Beit Din never asked me to change my name or to choose a Hebrew name. </p>\n\n<p>Although I met with the Beit Din on multiple occasions and the entire process took about 18-months (which what felt like a very humiliating process at the time, considering that both my mother and her mother are/were Jewish), no one ever asked me very substantive questions on halacha (during one meeting I, without prompting, gave a very short drash on that week's parasha, which was the most \"technical\" that the conversations ever seemed to get). So, it seemed like the meetings were a sort of formality, but the fact that the process took so long made it not seem like a formality...it was confusing.</p>\n\n<p>However, they did want to make sure that I was shomer shabbos and kept kosher, so they did ask very rudimentary questions about how to observe kashruth and Shabbat, both according to orthodox standards. Yet, there was no oversight (at least that I was aware) as to whether I was actually living an observant life (just to note: I was). </p>\n\n<p>I also didn't regularly meet with or study with my rabbi (or any rabbi for that matter, although I continued to study with my rebbetsen), who was also the rabbi that referred me to the Beit Din (and I doubt that he was \"reporting\" back to the Beit Din as to whether I was attending services, studying with his wife, wearing a skirt, observing shomer negiah, etc.) So both of those differ from a regular conversion, at least I assume. </p>\n\n<p>The Beit Din also wanted to make sure that my Israeli-born, Jewish-on-both-sides fiance was wearing tefillin each day. </p>\n\n<p>Definitely no one reminded me that it was my last chance to change my mind when it came time to immerse. </p>\n\n<p>If I recall the brachot...I made the regular t'vila bracha, then I'm pretty sure that I said a bracha that included the word \"stranger\" (ger, in hebrew of course, so I suppose this would be the conversion bracha), but I did not at any point say  shehechayanu. </p>\n\n<p>I know another woman who went through a giur l'chumrah on the East coast and her process also took some time. </p>\n\n<p>When I found out that I had to do a giur, I was told that it was specifically a giur l'chumrah, that I would just have to read some books and then meet with the Beit Din and immerse. I had heard of regular conversions taking a long time, but it seemed, or so I thought, that the giur l'chumrah would be faster. It wasn't. And at no point in the process did I know how long it would take. I just basically had to wait. It was absolutely horrible, especially since I was engaged at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Also unfortunate was that the rabbi marrying us made sure that my ketubah referred to me as a giur. </p>\n\n<p>Also no one dissuaded me three times. Isn't that a thing with regular conversions?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are two reasons for a Giyur l'chumra</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The original Bet Din is not one that is recognized as valid by one's local orthodox rabbi or others even if the original rabbis were orthodox.  This occurs when one or more of the rabbis on the original Bet Din were known to convert people who were not ready to observe Judaism properly, especially rabbis who accepted large sums of money to convert.</li>\n<li>Someone comes with a claim of being Jewish but this claim may not be easily verified.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unlike a non-Jew who comes to convert, there are no attempts to turn the candidate away.  In fact, the candidate is encouraged to accept all Mitzvot and customs as soon as possible.  The candidate is encouraged to improve her/his religiosity and to be fully orthodox in all matters. If the candidate requires circumcision, it is done asap (unlike a regular convert where the circumcision waits for about a month before conversion).

This is essentially a semicha which does not necessarily vouch for the recipient's knowledge or competency in halacha, but rather, testifies that the recipient is worthy to be called \"rabbi\" and serve in a position of leadership. In some yeshivot there is a formal curriculum which must be completed before receiving this semicha, usually extensive sections of the Orach Chaim section of Shulchan Aruch. Other rabbis and yeshivot simply issue this semicha to students who are well rounded and have an impressive grasp of general Jewish scholarship and are therefore worthy of the title \"rabbi\". Indeed, it is important to recall that \"rabbi\" essentially means \"teacher\", not necessarily \"halachic authority\".</p>\n\n<p>It is somewhat unclear how or why this semicha evolved. According to one theory, the Rav Umanhig semicha may have been first created by the Ner Yisrael yeshiva in Baltimore in order to allow yeshiva students to evade the draft during the Korean and Vietnam Wars under the \"clergy\" clause. After the draft was over, the Rav Umanhig semicha continued for those wishing to enter Jewish communal work, though not necessarily as pulpit rabbis. In this way those in teaching and similar positions could legitimately be addressed as \"rabbi\" without having to go through the intensity of formal semicha studies and learning the Yoreh Deah material.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2009/12/semicha-part-ii-of-iii.html\">http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2009/12/semicha-part-ii-of-iii.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So one could be, according to this, called \"rabbi\" simply as a function of their holding a particular teaching role but without the testing and approbation of forml semicha.**</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It is important to understand that the Semicha of today is not \"Traditional Semicha\" which was only given in an unbroken chain from Moshe Rabbeinu down, from each teacher to their (worthy) students. That Semicha was lost long ago. (Although it is possible to bring back according to the Rambam, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semikhah#Attempt_by_Rabbi_Jacob_Berab.2C_1538\">was attempted by Rav Yaakov Beirav</a> in 1538).</p>\n\n<p>What, then, is the Semicha of today?</p>\n\n<p>The Rema (Y.D. 242:14) writes that the Semicha of today is there for two purposes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For people to believe that he is capable of ruling on Halachic Shailot</li>\n<li>As permission from his teacher to rule. (As one is prohibited from issuing a Halachic ruling in the same city as his teacher without permission.) As such, if he lives in a different city, or his teacher is no longer alive, he would not need permission. As well, today most people do not have a רבו מובהק and therefore would not require permission.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Essentially, the only reason for most people to have Semicha today is for people to trust him. There is no Halachic requirement for someone to have Semicha in order to rule on a question to which he knows the answer.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Gedalia Anemer,zt'l, used to bristle when a day school principal would have all male Jewish subject teachers referred to as \"rabbi\" whether or not they had earned the credential. There have been impressive yeshiva instructrs at institutions such as Ner Israel who (20 years ago) might just be \"mister\" so and so.  Those days are disappearing, though and more and more Talmud instructrs without smicha are now called \"rabbi\" even though his working knowledge of the Shulchan Aruch may be limited. </p>\n\n\n",

While this case is similar, especially since there also seems to be discussion about whether Bris Milah is הותרה or דחויה, it is not exactly the same since a Bris Milah knife isn't used exclusively or even primarily for Brisim which over-ride the Shabbos (and whether it is הותרה or דחויה seems independent of whether pikuach nefesh is).</p>\n\n<p>A milah knife is muktzeh mechamas chesron kis, due to monetary loss (O.C. 308:1).

It would seem that it maintains this status even if Bris Milah is הותרה , but we have noted that unlike pikuach nefesh not every act of of milah is permitted on Shabbos. Even still we see that when a mohel has a bris scheduled for Shabbos then the milah knife is not muktzeh (Rema, Y.D. 266:2) because it wasn't muktzeh (set aside) during twilight since it was prepared for a permitted use.</p>\n\n<p>From this we might infer that \"כלי שמלאכתו לפיקוח נפש\" equipment of a hospital or EMT where there is a reasonable expectation of its use would not be muktzeh (see also M.B. 318:15).  This would seem to particularly true if the equipment was prepared (cleaned, stored, etc) in anticipation of Shabbos.  It is possible that this consideration could even apply to an item stored in non-emergency locations for emergency use (such as a defibrillator in a shul). It would seem that in at least some circumstances a \"כלי שמלאכתו לפיקוח נפש\" would not be be muktzeh (even if we say Shabbos is only set aside because of pikuach nefesh) and  there is need for a pesak to clarify when and if the likelihood it actually be needed has diminished enough that it can no longer be considered \"muchan/prepared\" for use.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>If I recall correctly the Nishmas Avraham says that a stethoscope is not muktzeh.

The first cathedra of this type, 94 centimetres in height, was unearthed against the south wall of the synagogue of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_el-Hammeh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">El Hammeh</a> (the Baths of Tiberias) at the side of the Ark...and is carved out of a single block of white limestone:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0yo5B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0yo5B.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>the second was found at Chorazin (Kerazeh), and like the rest of the building is of basalt.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RhToT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RhToT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Chorazin chair image taken from <a href=\"http://www.antiquities.org.il/t/item.aspx?CurrentPageKey=1&shalemid=2717\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>Roth himself continues on and explains why he believes these chairs cannot be the \"Chair of Moses\", and suggests that special chairs or tables - also discovered in ancient synagogues worldwide - that were used to hold Torah scrolls are the real \"Chair of Moses\".</p>\n<p>Israel Renov, on the other hand, in his essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27924631?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Af9e5706ff65195e845e3b9b7d69421bf&seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Seat of Moses</a>\", points out flaws in Roth's hypothesis. He then brings evidence that such chairs were in fact used by important community leaders, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.1.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...וּבֵית מִדְרָשׁוֹ שֶׁל רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר הָיָה עָשׂוּי כְּמִין רִיס, וְאֶבֶן אַחַת הָיְתָה שָׁם וְהָיְתָה מְיֻחֶדֶת לוֹ לִישִׁיבָה\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"...And the study hall of Rabbi Eliezer was built like a ris, and there was one stone there, and it was set aside for him [Rabbi Eliezer] to sit upon.\"</p>\n<p>This \"stone\", according to Renov, was Rabbi Eliezer's stone chair.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.26b.11?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 26b</a>), there's mention of a kind of platform used for reading the Torah. It was called a \"כורסייא\". Renov argues that if Rav Acha was talking about such a thing, as Roth opined, he would surely have used the same term, and not referred to it with a completely different term \"קתדרא דמשה\".</p>\n<p>For more info and other views, see <a href=\"http://talmudandarchaelogy.blogspot.com/2018/08/blog-post.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://segulamag.com/news/winepress-in-korazim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Article_72.4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. In short, most scholars nowadays disagree with Roth and believe that these special stone seats were most likely the \"Chair of Moses\" mentioned in Tannaic and Amoraic-era sources.</p>\n<p>Nowadays some synagogues have special chairs for rabbis, though generally not made of stone. Other synagogues set aside chairs for rabbis, but these chairs are the same as the rest of the congregation's. These seats are not referred to as \"the Chair of Moses\" or \"the Seat of Moses\" but simply as \"the rabbi's place/chair/seat/bench\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No such chair exists.</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew term for a seat may also be used to describe a rôle (the English word “position” has a similar feature): writings referring to people occupying Moses’ seat <em>might</em> refer to those who teach as Moses did.</p>\n\n\n",

The words you cite have a shewa naʿ where no originally short vowel existed. For example, we find מִקְדָּשׁ but in Shemot 15:17 we have מִקְּדָֿשׁ. We also get an unexpected dagesh in הַצְּפִֿינוֹ (as you note, in Shemot 2:3) and מַמְּגֻֿרוֹת (Joel  1:17).</p>\n\n<p>Blau believes that this dagesh indicates that the shewa is naʿ, and not gemination. He does not suggest a reason for the appearance of the anomalous dagesh.</p>\n\n<p>He states the phenomenon \"is quite rare when the letter following the šwa is not a <em>bgdkpt</em> letter, e.g., יִקְּהַת ‘the obedience(?) of’, pronounced <em>yiqəhat</em> Gen 49:1\" (Blau, Phonology & Morphology of Biblical Hebrew, p. 114).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am not convinced that the letter with the dagesh is not geminated; at least, not at the time of the Masoretes. The University of Michigan manuscript, for example, has the form מִקֲּדָשׁ (and not מִקֲֿדָשׁ) (Shemot 15:17), which apparently geminates the qof. As Double AA commented, a hatef would seem to be the natural choice to make explicit that a shewa is naʿ without gemination.</p>\n\n<p>Khan appears to agree. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometimes the preceding consonant is geminated, e.g., מִקְּדָ֕שׁ [miqqaˈðɔː∫] ‘sanctuary’ (Exod. 15.17 < מִקְדָּשׁ [miqdɔː∫]), עִקְּב֥וֹת [ʕiqqaˈvoːχ] ‘footprints of’ (Psa. 89.52 < עִקְבוֹת [ʕiqvoːχ]), מַמְּרֹרִֽים [mammaʀoːˈʀiːm] ‘bitterness’ (Job 9.18 < מַמְרֹרִים [mammaʀoːʀiːm) (<em>Epenthesis: Biblical Hebrew</em>, Encyclopedia of Hebrew Language and Linguistics)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do Segulas Work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How do segulas work? For example, according to the Zohar, one who reads the Ketores daily will get all sorts of berachos in his financial areas and will become wealthy.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the amount of money one is supposed to make was pre-decreed by God on rosh hashana.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems Segulas are able to add to what was pre-decreed? Can anyone clarify this difficulty?</p>\n\n<p>(I'm asking in a general way especially in financial matters. The whole concept seems to contradict the shaar bitachon, which says to trust God in financial matters and realize that \"means are all the same to God and nothing you do will add or subtract in the least\")</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Personally, I think that <em>segulos</em> are psychological aids. It's not that you bake a key in your <em>challah</em> and magically you somehow make more money. Rather, the baking of the key in the <em>challah</em> is supposed to be a symbolic gesture that will convey to you that all <em>parnassah</em> really comes from God. And once that becomes more clear to you, it will help your prayers, and your trust in God, and hence your observance of the <em>mitzvos</em>, which actually <em>is</em> a valid form of gaining this-worldly benefits (see Deut. 11:13).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I will compare this concept to two other phenomena:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Tzitzis</em></strong>. There is a commandment to wear <em>tzitzis</em> on every four-cornered garment with one string of <em>techeles</em>. Why? \"וּרְאִיתֶם אֹתוֹ וּזְכַרְתֶּם אֶת-כָּל-מִצְו‍ֹת יְהוָה, וַעֲשִׂיתֶם אֹתָם\" - \"<em>And you will see it and you will remember all the commandments of God, and you will do them</em>\". Somehow, wearing these strings will provide a reminder of God's commandments. They are somehow symbolic. They are a psychological aid. I like to think of <em>segulos</em> as extra-biblical <em>tzitzis</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbolism of the Prophets</strong>. We find this all the time. In order for a prophet to convey a certain message to the people, God would tell them to do something symbolic to help the people understand the message. Isaiah walked around naked and barefoot for days (or maybe years). Jeremiah harnessed himself to a yolk. Ezekiel laid on his side for hundreds of days, and then turned around onto his other side for a few more. Hoshea married a prostitute. Etc., etc. You get the point. Why did they do these things? Why didn't they just tell the people God's message? The answer is obvious. Sometimes you can read something or have something told to you over and over again. But when someone acts it out, when it happens in practice, that's when it really sinks in. Same here. You can read about God's <em>hashgacha</em> and hear lectures about it all day. But the symbolic gestures, when you do something active to show it, sometimes that's what it takes to sink in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The consequence of this is that <em>segulos</em> only \"work\" if they are meaningful to you. If you do a <em>segula</em> because you lost a bet, or with skepticism or sarcasm, you're missing the point. You do a <em>segula</em> because you grasp the symbolism. If it's something that turns you off rather than being at all meaningful, it's counter-productive.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not going to claim that this is how everyone has ever understood <em>segulos</em>. There will probably be statements across the vast ocean of Jewish literature that contradict this. Chida (for example) may not have understood <em>segulos</em> like this. But I think that this is a valid approach to them, and perhaps how many people have understood it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Another possibility is that segulot work because they are ma'aseh Satan - the works of the evil inclination. Think of how ingenious the Satan is that he plies unsuspecting pious Jew with promises that by performing this seeming act of devotion he will be granted his wish. This person then abdicates the torah-mandated service of God, putting aside things like torah study time to pursue these smoke-and-mirrors. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I have found a <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ojAaVY167NA/UXURLf2QF5I/AAAAAAAAAds/89VxGIc1Tek/s1600/%D7%A1%D7%92%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of segulot</a> which come from the torah or chazal and cannot be misconstrued as the work of the Satan</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Pretty sure they don't. I have tried several myself and without any statistical evidence that they do work, I wouldn't rely on anecdotes. Conceptually they also make no sense. Besides the problem you pointed out think about the message they convey: You don't have to be a good person necessarily, just do segulah X and God <strong>will be forced</strong> to grant you something or other. </p>\n\n<p>If in fact they do (or did) have any basis once upon a time I would assume it was related to other magical practices, you could say, for example that the gemarah's formula to see demons is a \"segulah\" for seeing demons.</p>\n\n<p>Source: My own experience and logical conjecture. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> To illustrate this point I undertook to read a special <strong>segulah</strong> version of the ketores (provided by the OP) for 40 days. After having successfully completed this experiment and having followed all the instructions provided I can report that I see not one scintilla of any improvement in my life in any way whatsoever. There has been no positive change in any of things I prayed for, either for the Jewish community or myself and my family. Thus I must conclude that segulas (or at least this one) are not efficacious at all and that any success one find by using them is merely coincidence or misperception.</p>\n\n\n",

This would wipe the knife but would not remove the food stuck inside the holes in the knife.

For example, those who say: Since my piece of bread fell out of my mouth, or my staff fell from my hand, I will not travel to this place today, since if I were to go I would not be able to accomplish my desires.</p>\n<p>Since a fox passed on my right side, I will not go out of my door today, since if I were to go out I would meet a deceiver.</p>\n<p>Similarly, [this category includes] those who hear the chirping of a bird and say: This will happen or this will not happen; it is beneficial to do this or it is detrimental to do this.

If it will not happen, I will not do it, as Eliezer, the servant of Abraham did, and the things of the like - all this is forbidden. Anyone who does one of these things because of such omens is [liable for] lashes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Halacha 4)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is meant by a diviner? This refers to a person who performs certain deeds to cause him to fall into a trance and have his mind cleared of all thoughts until he can predict the future, saying, \"This will happen\" or \"This will not happen;\" or saying, \"it is proper to do such and such. Be careful to do so.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Halacha 6)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is forbidden to divine or to inquire of a diviner. A person who inquires of a diviner is given \"stripes for rebelliousness.\" In contrast, the diviner himself is [punished by] lashes if he performs one of the above or other similar acts, as [Deuteronomy 18:10] states: \"There shall not be found among you one who passes..., one who practices divination.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Halacha 7)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who is a fortuneteller?

[This applies] even though one does not perform a deed, but merely relates the falsehoods which the fools consider to be words of truth and wisdom. Anyone who performs a deed because of an astrological calculation or arranges his work or his journeys to fit a time that was suggested by the astrologers is [liable for] lashes, as [Leviticus 19:26] states: \"Do not tell fortunes.\"</p>\n<p>Also included in the scope of this prohibition is one who performs magic tricks and deludes those who observe him into thinking that he performs wonders although he is not doing so.

It is not fitting for the Jews who are wise sages to be drawn into such emptiness, nor to consider that they have any value as [implied by Numbers 23:23]: \"No black magic can be found among Jacob, or occult arts within Israel.\" Similarly, [Deuteronomy 18:14] states: \"These nations which you are driving out listen to astrologers and diviners. This is not [what God... has granted] you.\"</p>\n<p>Whoever believes in [occult arts] of this nature and, in his heart, thinks that they are true and words of wisdom, but are forbidden by the Torah, is foolish and feebleminded. He is considered like women and children who have underdeveloped intellects.</p>\n<p>The masters of wisdom and those of perfect knowledge know with clear proof that all these crafts which the Torah forbade are not reflections of wisdom, but rather, emptiness and vanity which attracted the feebleminded and caused them to abandon all the paths of truth. For these reasons, when the Torah warned against all these empty matters, it advised [Deuteronomy 18:13]: \"Be of perfect faith with God, your Lord.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Halacha 16)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>That would depend at what kind of advice you're asking. I asked this question to one of my Rebbeim once, concerning a mekubal who undeniably had such powers, but who I had no reason to consider a Gadol or Tzaddik. I wasn't even sure whether he's a Talmid Chacham. What my Rebbi told me made a lot of sense. He said if one is simply going for a Bracha, go to an established Gadol. If you're going to him because you have a tzara, and the mekubal may tell you what in your behavior is causing you that tzara, then by all means go. His reasoning was as follows: Practical Kabbalah includes such practices as Chochmat Hapartzuf and Chochmat Hayad, which allows the mekubal versed in them to know detailed information about a person by examining his face or the palm of his hand. This way the mekubal can sometimes know that a person is transgressing a certain Aveirah, and that that transgression is what is causing his tzara. Therefore going to a knowledgeable mekubal can be productive in helping people with certain troubles.</p>\n\n<p>Someone I know was having specific medical problems for several years, and the doctors couldn't help him. A mekubal then told his relative that he was beshogeg being oveir on a certain aveirah. He told him to tell his relative to be careful with xyz. A few weeks later, the problem was gone.</p>\n\n\n",

I have not reviewed that.  But I have learned several of the mishnas listed above and there are some that come to mind, some in Challah for example, which I can't recall ever seeing in the Bavli. </p>\n\n<p>Third, even if every mishna is somehow mentioned in the Bavli, I do not think that it is an appropriate way to learn the Mishnayos.  They should be learned in the order that Rebbe placed them -- within context to each other.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What percentage of Chabad still believes their Rebbe is the Messiah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any statistics as to what percentage of Chabad still believes that their Rebbe is the Messiah? Is it the majority or simply a very vocal minority? Have there been any serious studies made on the issue?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note this question seeks statistics <em>not</em> ideology.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>Having lived and studied in Crown Heights for several months--before which I believed that a significant proportion of Lubavitchers, perhaps 40% or half, did not believe the Rebbe was Moshiach--I have been surprised to find that the notion that the Rebbe is the presumptive, if not actual Messiah is very dominant in Chabad. Chabad Houses and conferences and other events \"for the public\" will not give this impression, as Chabad fears quite correctly that it will turn Jews off of Chabad, if not Judaism. But the fact is (or seems to be) that your average Chabad Anash in Crown Heights holds this belief.</p>\n\n<p>Within this, there are varying degrees of subscription to the doctrine as well as vocality about it. While many, many take for granted that the Rebbe was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/60462/1516\">the Nasi HaDor and the Moshiach HaDor</a>, and almost as many would not hesitate to call him the \"presumptive\" Moshiach, only some are very convinced that he is/was the actual Moshiach, and fewer believe that he never physically died. The latter is, surprisingly, not a \"fringe\" belief in Chabad. It is a minority belief and not mainstream, but no one would be shocked to hear someone say it. That said, many of the people who subscribe to the belief that the Rebbe is Moshiach are quiet about it, especially among non-Chabad. And even within Lubavitch, there is something of a Don't Ask Don't Tell policy about this matter: although a large group of vocal Yechi elements do not include themselves in such a contract, many people who personally subscribe to the belief that the Rebbe is Moshiach--and especially those who don't--will not go out of their way to bring up the topic, whether with other Chabadniks or in public. </p>\n\n<p>The questioner does not ask why the belief is so widespread. But, as someone who loves Chabad and the Lubavitcher Rebbe, I feel a bit of obligation to explain. (For more, please see Menachem Posner's answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/50348/1516\">this</a> questioner--I think it's very good.) The Rebbe was by any standard a great tzaddik. His genuine wisdom is immediately perceptible from his talks and writings. His words and actions motivated a worldwide movement to connect Jews with Torah, to assist Jews b'gashmius and b'ruchnius, and in many ways to unite am Yisrael. He indeed performed miracles, in the sense that miracles tend emerge from systematically positive action, speech, and thought. He was personally righteous, and there is no doubt that he brought about a new tradition for righteousness in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Many Chabadniks who were zoche to meet the Lubavitcher Rebbe have family traditions of very meaningful encounters with the Rebbe, of good advice and miracles, and these stories--combined inevitably with cognitive biases, including that bias called love--sometimes produce the belief that the Rebbe is more than human. Whether or not this is correct is a separate matter. The Lubavitchers no longer have a living Rebbe; the Rebbe they did have was great and beloved; and these facts combined produce a yearning toward the past that is perhaps, after all, not totally out of place in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>So as much as the \"official\" policy where Chabad interacts with the world is to downplay this part of Chabad belief, when Chabad are safely within their own circles, it emerges with ardency and ardor. The curriculum in the in-town schools is very, very focused on the idea of \"Moshiach,\" with or without explicit connection to the Rebbe. Discussions, blessings, and interactions between Chabadniks are similarly concentrated on \"Moshiach\" and the Ge'ulah. If one desires a statistical study, one has merely to count the number of \"Yechi\" kippot on the street in Crown Heights. (Lots; in 770 at least half. And these are the people who actively and vocally endorse the Rebbe as Moshiach.) In short, the idea that the Rebbe is Moshiach is not a secondary belief in Chabad. But it is perhaps worth asking whether this is belief is truly wicked, or simply the inevitable result of memory, grief, and longing. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I want to add, after further reflection, that it is the way of Chasidim not to believe things that it would be seriously grieving to believe. Some examples are the Holocaust and the Rebbe's histalkus and that Moshiach isn't here yet. I posit that self-deception, although not in fashion now, is actually a powerful psychological tool, and perhaps the only one by which one can survive.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>For what its worth. I corresponded a while ago (through the official chabad website) with regards to the issue of the Rebbe being moshiach and the proliferation of this ideology within chabad. The responses I received were as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No, the official Chabad officials do not hold that the Rebbe is Moshiach. </p>\n  \n  <p>There is no underground movement which unoffficially permits for statements to the contrary to be made. I'm not sure why there is a proliferation of such beliefs in some parts of Israel. In North and South America, Russia and Europe that is not the case be that as it may, it is individuals not the official stance of the movement. </p>\n  \n  <p>The Rebbe not only did not want anyone to perpetuate the idea that he\n  is Moshiach openly as you said, but he didn't want the idea to be\n  perpetuated at all, period.</p>\n  \n  <p>Along with the other mitzvahs and mitzvah campaigns which he initiated\n  the Rebbe encouraged us to spread the word that Moshiach is coming, he\n  did not say 'tell the world I'm am Moshiach'…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And another related response from Rabbi Menahem Posner:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a. I do not believe that the Rebbe ever said he would be Moshiach\n  after his death. Rather, the belief seemed to evolve as follows: More\n  than anything in the world, the Rebbe wanted Moshiach to come. He\n  constantly spoke about his arrival and worked tirelessly to bring\n  Jewry to a state where they would merit his arrival.</p>\n  \n  <p>It was not a huge leap for some people to connect the dots and assume\n  that the Rebbe himself would one day be Moshiach.</p>\n  \n  <p>After his passing in 1994, people were at loss regarding how to\n  continue. They just were not ready to say goodbye to the Rebbe and to\n  his vision of Moshiach’s imminent arrival (and rightfully so).\n  Different people reacted in different ways.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many Chassidim saw their mission to continue the Rebbe’s work of\n  spreading Judaism wherever possible as their response to the loss\n  which we and world Judaism had suffered. Others continued to refer to\n  him as Moshiach as a way of expressing their conviction that he and\n  his message live on.</p>\n  \n  <p>This well-intentioned, but misguided, response is the root of what you\n  sometimes see today.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some of the Rebbe's works were edited and others were not. I am not\n  aware of him editing and approving a work with \"melech hamoshiach\"\n  appended to his name. My assumption is that this was added afterward\n  by Mishichist elements.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rebbe did indeed speak about prophecy in our time prior to the\n  advent of Moshiach in the sicha that you reference...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge no such study has been done within Chabad chassidim... and even though in general we say 'Ein lo ra-inu ra-aya' (Zevachim 12:4, \"'We have not seen' is not a proof\"), controversial studies/statistics the likes of this would surely have spread very quickly with very loud responses.</p>\n\n\n",

We could not part the waters at the Sea, alone, but we had to take the first step into the water.  See, e.g. Rashi to Exodus 14:15.  Moreover, we accept that as mortal humans, we may not be perfect, per se, but that if we make efforts to seek perfect observance, G-d will deem us perfect.  Psalm 19:14.  </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, during our lifetimes, we have the duty to cleanse ourselves, physically and spiritually, before standing before G-d in prayer.  We at least wash our hands ritually.  Many people go to the mikvah, even though the Temple is gone.  And although we are not strictly as spiritually pure as we would like, we believe that G-d will complete our cleansing, as Isaiah saw in his vision of an appearance before Hashem's court. Isaiah 6:6-7.  However, in death, when we are truly going to stand before G-d, we are unable to attend to our physical cleaning, therefore it is up to our friends and neighbors to assist us in that cleansing.  </p>\n\n<p>We see this in the quotation from Yoma 85b, that some chevra kadishas say during the Tahara:</p>\n\n<p>\"Rabbi Akiva said: Happy are you Israel. Before whom do you cleanse yourselves and who cleanses you? It is your Father, who is in heaven. As it is said (Ezekiel 36:25) “Then I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness and from all your idols I will cleanse you.” The Holy One blessed be He purifies Israel.</p>\n\n<p>So, it would appear that although the deceased cannot himself, or herself, prepare his body to meet his or her maker, we grant them that final courtesy.</p>\n\n\n",

Going through Chumash (Search keyword in Bar-Ilan: “+לא +וכל+”) it appears that Onkelos is meticulous in differentiating between instances where the behavior in question is truly unthinkable and where it is perfectly reasonable but merely being discouraged henceforth.</p>\n\n<p>1 [A]: הִנֵּה נָא מָצָא עַבְדְּךָ חֵן בְּעֵינֶיךָ וַתַּגְדֵּל חַסְדְּךָ אֲשֶׁר עָשִׂיתָ עִמָּדִי לְהַחֲיוֹת אֶת נַפְשִׁי <strong>וְאָנֹכִי לֹא אוּכַל לְהִמָּלֵט הָהָרָה</strong> פֶּן תִּדְבָּקַנִי הָרָעָה וָמַתִּי. - בראשית יט:יט</p>\n\n<p>הא כען אשכח עבדך רחמין קדמך ואסגיתא טיבותך דעבדת עמי לקיימא ית נפשי <strong>ואנא לית אנא יכיל לאשתיזבא לטורא</strong> דלמא תערעינני בשתא ואמות. - תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>In this instance, heading for the mountains was out of the question for Lot; not something anyone had forbidden him to do.</p>\n\n<p>2 [A]: מַהֵר הִמָּלֵט שָׁמָּה <strong>כִּי לֹא אוּכַל לַעֲשׂוֹת דָּבָר</strong> עַד בֹּאֲךָ שָׁמָּה עַל כֵּן קָרָא שֵׁם הָעִיר צוֹעַר. - בראשית יט:כב</p>\n\n<p>אוחי אשתיזב לתמן <strong>ארי לא אכול למעבד פתגמא</strong> עד מיתך לתמן על כן קרא שמה דקרתא צוער. - תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>It would appear that in this instance the מלאך was truly incapable of proceeding until Lot was out of harm's way.</p>\n\n<p>3 [A]: וַיַּעַן לָבָן וּבְתוּאֵל וַיֹּאמְרוּ מֵה' יָצָא הַדָּבָר <strong>לֹא נוּכַל דַּבֵּר אֵלֶיךָ רַע אוֹ טוֹב</strong>. - בראשית כד:נ</p>\n\n<p>ואתיב לבן ובתואל ואמרו מן קדם ה' נפק פתגמא <strong>לית אנחנא יכלין למללא עמך ביש או טב</strong>. - תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>At this point, disagreeing with Eliezer seemed unthinkable, but was certainly not the subject of anyone’s command.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Let's fast forward to example #13, the verse mentioned in the original question.</p>\n\n<p>13 [A]: וַיֹּאמֶר מֹשֶׁה אֶל ה' <strong>לֹא יוּכַל הָעָם לַעֲלֹת אֶל הַר סִינָי</strong> כִּי אַתָּה הַעֵדֹתָה בָּנוּ לֵאמֹר הַגְבֵּל אֶת הָהָר וְקִדַּשְׁתּוֹ. - שמות יט:כג</p>\n\n<p>ואמר משה קדם ה' <strong>לא יכול עמא למסק לטורא דסיני</strong> ארי את אסהידת בנא למימר תחים ית טורא וקדישהי. - תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>While this verse isn't particularly clear, what Moshe seems to be saying is that it is inconceivable that the Jews would climb the mountain because: a) the mountain has already been cordoned off, or b) climbing was already stated to be at the pain of death, or c) when a new prohibition is introduced it is referred to in terms of ‘permission’, but once it has been established and accepted the act forbidden may be deemed ‘undoable’. Whatever the case is, it seems clear from the context that Moshe’s point here was precisely that for the Jews to climb the mountain would be unimaginable.</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>Skipping to example #17, we witness the first instance of the alternate translation.</p>\n\n<p>17 [B]: וַיַּעַן בִּלְעָם וַיֹּאמֶר אֶל עַבְדֵי בָלָק אִם יִתֶּן לִי בָלָק מְלֹא בֵיתוֹ כֶּסֶף וְזָהָב <strong>לֹא אוּכַל לַעֲבֹר אֶת פִּי ה' אֱ-לֹהָי</strong> לַעֲשׂוֹת קְטַנָּה אוֹ גְדוֹלָה. – במדבר כב:יח</p>\n\n<p>ואתיב בלעם ואמר לעבדי בלק אם יתין לי בלק מלי ביתיה כסף ודהב <strong>לית לי רשו למעבר על גזירת מימרא דה' א-להי</strong> למעבד זעירתא או רבתא. – תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>In this instance, accepting Balak’s offer seemed eminently doable and no known, established obstacle stood in Bilam’s way. Thus, Onkelos has Bilam state that he has no permission to do what he ordinarily found quite easy. This is in direct contrast with Balak’s following response.</p>\n\n<p>18 [A]: וַיֹּאמֶר בָּלָק אֶל בִּלְעָם הֲלֹא שָׁלֹחַ שָׁלַחְתִּי אֵלֶיךָ לִקְרֹא לָךְ לָמָּה לֹא הָלַכְתָּ אֵלָי <strong>הַאֻמְנָם לֹא אוּכַל כַּבְּדֶךָ</strong>. – במדבר כב:לז</p>\n\n<p>ואמר בלק לבלעם הלא משלח שלחית לותך למקרי לך למא לא אתיתא לותי <strong>הבקושטא הויתא אמר לית אנא יכיל ליקרותך</strong>. – תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>Balak retorts incredulously: “Would you honestly say that I am incapable of honoring you?!” Is there any conceivable, obvious obstacle of any sort standing in the way of my intention to properly fete you?</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>With the exception of 2 examples in Bilam’s speech, all the variations on לא יכול so far are intended in the sense of literal undoability. It is only in Parshat Re’eh where these words acquire the regular meaning of “I don’t let you”.</p>\n\n<p>22 [B]: <strong>לֹא תוּכַל לֶאֱכֹל בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ</strong> מַעְשַׂר דְּגָנְךָ וְתִירֹשְׁךָ וְיִצְהָרֶךָ וּבְכֹרֹת בְּקָרְךָ וְצֹאנֶךָ וְכָל נְדָרֶיךָ אֲשֶׁר תִּדֹּר וְנִדְבֹתֶיךָ וּתְרוּמַת יָדֶךָ. – דברים יב:יז</p>\n\n<p><strong>לית לך רשו למיכל בקרוך</strong> מעשר עבורך וחמרך ומשחך ובכורי תורך וענך וכל נדרך דתדר ונדבתך ואפרשות ידך. – תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>[Contrast with this other instance in Re’eh:</p>\n\n<p>23 [A]: וְכִי יִרְבֶּה מִמְּךָ הַדֶּרֶךְ <strong>כִּי לֹא תוּכַל שְׂאֵתוֹ</strong> כִּי יִרְחַק מִמְּךָ הַמָּקוֹם אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר ה' אֱ-לֹהֶיךָ לָשׂוּם שְׁמוֹ שָׁם כִּי יְבָרֶכְךָ ה' אֱ-לֹהֶיךָ. – דברים יד:כד</p>\n\n<p>וארי תסגי מנך אורחא <strong>ארי לא תכול למטליה</strong> ארי יתרחק מנך אתרא דיתרעי ה' א-להך לאשראה שכינתיה תמן ארי יברכנך ה' א-להך. תרגום אונקלוס]</p>\n\n<p>24 [B]: <strong>לֹא תוּכַל לִזְבֹּחַ אֶת הַפָּסַח</strong> בְּאַחַד שְׁעָרֶיךָ אֲשֶׁר ה' אֱ-לֹהֶיךָ נֹתֵן לָךְ – דברים טז:ה</p>\n\n<p><strong>לית לך רשו למכס ית פסחא</strong> בחדא מן קרוך דה' א-להך יהיב לך. – תרגום אונקלוס</p>\n\n<p>Another 6 instances possessing this latter meaning follow, as well as a few with the more common sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I found a sefer that asks you question, see <a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?14138&\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?14138&</a> pg. 427 and I found another sefer that gives a weak anwer that since HaShem forbid going up the mountain all the Jews looked at doing so as an impossibility and not just as a prohibition, see <a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?60336&\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?60336&</a> pg. 52.</p>\n\n<p>(I couldn't find these sources on HebrewBooks.org, so I gave the sources from OTZAR hoping that some of you have this service even though it is not free).</p>\n\n\n",

(You notice this the most at weddings when a hankerchief or pen is used as a method of transferring ownership)  Money is muktzeh on shabbat because of it's connection to a contract, and one is not allowed to write on shabbat.

The Machaber then says however we (\"anu\") stop learning both to say Krias Shema and tefillah. The M\"B there in Sif-Katan 6 writes that R' Shimon and his friends were learning Torah all the time and would not stop to do work; however we who stop learning to do work certainly should stop learning for tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: from the time of R' Shimon through the Shulchan Aruch and till today, was there anyone that we know of that was still on this level like R' Shimon that really wouldn't stop learning to daven?</p>\n\n<p>Surely there were great Rishonim and Achronim that certainly we would say about them that they were learning constantly and perhaps did fit into such a category of \"Toraso Umanaso\". Even in our generation we find great people (like R' Eliyashuv ZT\"L) about whom many say that he simply never stop learning for anything (except of course to be makayim mitzvas, daven, etc.) I think if someone would say he wasn't on this level, it could be that he would be chastised for saying such a thing. Perhaps though because of the humble nature of these Gedolim (in our generation and in previous ones) they simply wouldn't want to accept such a title on them and patur. And certainly not to practice in that way lest \"normal\" people come to learn from it the wrong thing. Perhaps this itself is the answer.</p>\n\n<p>But again my question is if this was ever applicable to anyone after R' Shimon (whether before the Shulchan Aruch or after) and if there was someone in this category who davened anyway, why weren't they accustomed to skipping prayers, like this SA says?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I could not find anyone since Rashbi and friends in who considered themselves on this level.

On the other hand, obviously saving lives is more important than, well, almost anything, including respect for the dead. What are the prevalent halachic views on postmortem organ donation? Does its permissibility perhaps depend on what organ is being donated? (I can imagine that donation of a heart is likely to save a life; an eye, not so much.) Does it depend on whether the likely recipient is Jewish (and hence, perhaps, on whether the donor is in Israel)? What other factors go into the <em>p'sakim</em> (halachic rulings)?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(Just to clarify, this question is not about the brain-death debate.

I assume if that rabbi had traveled to Babylon he would have said ועל המעדנים.)</p>\n\n<p>This seems to reject the authorities who justify limiting the switching to fruit blessings by describing the special connection that fruit of the seven species has with the land. It doesn't prove that the switch <em>should</em> be made by grain (which does seems to parallel rice), but it rejects a main logic against making that switch. </p>\n\n\n",

Where is the line drawn between conflicts that warrant pushing off relations, and those that do not warrant it? Some might be fatigue, illness, business activities that might or might not jeopardize one's livelihood, other schedule conflicts (performing arts rehearsals, chavrusos).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As Seth commented, Consulting Your Local Orthodox Rabbi is always an appropriate first step because your particular facts could result in a totally different answer than the generalized citations to authorities that are offered here.  </p>\n\n<p>As I have reviewed the sources, the rules of appropriate sexual behavior are not very well defined for every situation, and some proscriptions in the Talmud and the Codes are viewed as binding by some and as advice by others.  Again, a reason to CYLOR.  Rambam, in the Mishna Torah, Chapters 14 and 15 of Ishus, goes into some detail about the obligations of husband and wife to have relations with their spouse. I believe that these sources assume that both husband and wife are healthy and each have a healthy interest in sex.  Accordingly, these would suggest that the couple does all that is possible to get to the mikvah at the appointed time and have relations that night.  But there is <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/question.php?id=5820\" rel=\"nofollow\">no obligation</a> to have relations that night, and there is even concern that the pressure on either partner will result in a loss of shalom bayis.  On that point, I think that Rabbi Frand's tape on Shalom Bayis is helpful.  </p>\n\n<p>Poor health, fatigue, business conflicts, even Daf Yomi classes, are common conflicts with shalom bayis in the bedroom.  Nevertheless, the Halacha recognizes that both husband and wife have conjugal obligations to make time for intimacy, Mishna Torah, Ishus 14:7-8; Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 240:1, and most authorities will urge the couple to make allowances.  If the wife is too fatigued when the husband comes home regularly from work or Daf classes, they will encourage him to make changes in his schedule.  If the wife is fatigued, for example from mikvah night preparations, she might be encouraged to take a nap in the afternoon, and the husband will be encouraged to do what he can to facilitate that (like taking the kids out for an outing without Mom).  Compromise, consideration and compassion will go far.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There will be no cut-and-dry answer on this one.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard Rabbi Barry Freundel say publicly that he tells young men before their weddings: \"mikvah night, you have the responsibility to make the night special for her.\" He mentioned a fellow who decided to forgo an important business dinner so he could be home with his wife, even though that meant missing a promotion. (My impression was this was meritorious, not obligatory.) Of course, if the couple is stressed because of a tight financial situation and that promotion would honestly help ... again, every situation is different.</p>\n\n<p>Yoatzot.org has reprinted several questions from women who are too anxious on mikvah night; if it really, really works better for the couple to wait, then that's probably the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, ask your rabbi. And your rabbi will ask how your spouse feels, so make sure you know that too.</p>\n\n\n",

Generally speaking, members of a single Tekufah may argue with their counterparts in the same Tekufa, but not with an earlier time period. This is quite a strict rule with regards to Amoraim vs. Tanaim and comes up countless times in the Gemora (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=64b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 64b</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=14b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taanis 14b</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baba Metzia 5a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kesubos 8a</a>).

However the Rama (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9725&st=&pgnum=152\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CM 25:2</a>) writes in the name of the <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharik</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1142&pgnum=116\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shoresh 96</a>) that we follow the later opinion if the earlier one was well known.

(See for example <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=20&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Brochos 20a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=35b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">35b</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=112b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 112b</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=53&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eiruvin 53a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=53&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 53a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=24b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Niddah 24b</a>). This trend continues post Talmud as is evident from the Rishonim and Achronim who say countless times that \"Kama'i Adifa\" - earlier Sages are greater.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally there are certain cutoff dates when it was accepted that henceforth they would not argue on previous generations. The Kesef Mishna (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=90154&rid=14652\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Mamrim 2:1</a>) explains that although Rambam maintains that \"the judge who exists at that time\" (Devorim 17:9) may overrule previous decisions, once the Mishna was completed it was universally accepted that no later generations would revoke its decisions, and similarly once the Gemora was complete, no person may disagree. The Maharam Alshakar (ibid) quotes the Raavad that one who argues against a Gaon is like arguing against the Talmud, and the Alshich (ibid) compares the difference between Tosfos and the Maharik to that of a Tanna and Amorah.</p>\n\n<p>The question posed a very strong point: \"In most other intellectual disciplines we assume that those who come later have the benefit of more information, better access to resources, and the 20/20 hindsight of seeing the errors of those before them. For example today we may have the benefit of materials the Rishonim were never aware of.\" This is a very valid idea acknowledged in Halachic methodology - \"Halacha Kebasrai\". (See Rif Eurivin 35a, Tosfos Kidushin 45b \"Haveh Uvda\", Rosh Sanhedrin 4:6 for just some examples. It is codified by the Rama in Shulchan Aruch CM 25:2). Being that later Sages were aware of the preexisting opinions and still chose to argue we give greater credence to the latter authorities.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to emphasize that this is not due to any <em>intrinsic</em> advantage of the later authorities. Rather it is a technical advantage due to the fact that they happened to live later. So, there is an intellectual advantage to being earlier, and a technical advantage of coming later. This already explains the veneration we have for earlier generations; although we may have access to more data than them, we still have the utmost respect for their incomparable level of understanding. Additionally, there will be times when the rule that a later generation may not argue against an earlier one will take precedence over the rule of \"Halacha Kebasrai\". Thus, we rule like the Talmud Bavli over the Yerushalmi, but a Rishon will never argue against the Talmud. (This is as mentioned above much clearer earlier on, and as we come closer to our times the cut-off points become much blurrier).</p>\n\n<p>The Shibaley Haleket <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8919&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"noreferrer\">brings</a> a parable from <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%99_%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Yeshaya Mitrani</a> (author of Tosfos Harid) that expresses this point beautifully: A giant is taller and therefore able to see further than a midget. Yet, if you put the midget on the shoulders of the giant - he will be able to see further. This is not because he is greater, rather because he is building upon what came before him. (The Chavos Da'as (in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=619\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hakdoma to YD</a>) takes this one step further: this would be be true if the giant and midget had equal eyesight. However nowadays even our sight is impaired and it doesn't help that we are \"on the shoulders of giants\").</p>\n\n<p>For further reading, see the two volume set \"Hamachlokes B'halacha\", which compiles the views of many poskim on Halachic disputes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a story with Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky Zatzal who was travelling on a plane with one of his grandchildren. His grandchild was making sure he was comfortable and serving him with all his needs. A non-Jew that was sitting nearby asked Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky why is it that Jewish people show such respect to their elders? Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky responded that we believe that Hashem created man, so a previous generation is one generation closer to the original handiwork of Hashem, therefore we show respect to our elders, however those who believe that humanity evolved from apes, each previous generation is one generation closer to the original ape, and therefore do not respect their elders.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Firstly, here are a couple of mekorot which maintain this way of thinking:</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat 112b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם ראשונים בני מלאכים - אנחנו בני אנשים. ואם ראשונים בני אנשים - אנו\n  כחמורים, ולא כחמורו של רבי חנינא בן דוסא ושל רבי פנחס בן יאיר, אלא\n  כשאר חמורים</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Zera said in Raba b. Zimuna's name: If the earlier [scholars] were\n  sons of angels, we are sons of men; and if the earlier [scholars] were\n  sons of men, we are like asses, and not [even] like asses of R.Hanina\n  b. Dosa and R. Phinehas b. Jair, but like other asses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Eiruvin 53a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי יוחנן: לִבן של ראשונים כפתחו של אולם, ושל אחרונים כפתחו של\n  היכל, ואנו כמלוא נקב מחט סידקית</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Johanan further stated: The hearts of the ancients were like the\n  door of the Ulam, but that of the last generations was like the door\n  of the Hekal, but ours is like the eye of a fine needle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>---------<strong>Edit</strong>----------</p>\n\n<p>Here is a post-talmud source which touches upon this:</p>\n\n<p>Sefer Hayom Yom 6th Shvat states: (The narrator is the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Alter Rebbe is the Baal HaTanya)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My father wrote that he heard in the name of the Alter Rebbe that all\n  rabbinic authors until and including the Taz and Shach, composed their\n  works with ruach hakodesh, the Divine Spirit. An individual's ruach\n  hakodesh, as explained by Korban Ha'eida in Tractate Sh'kalim (Talmud\n  Yerushalmi), end of ch. 3, means that the mysteries of Torah are\n  revealed to him. This comes from the aspect of chochma in its\n  pre-revelation state</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we take this line of thinking - in addition to what the Gemara states - that further back means greater - then it becomes clear that saying that the Rambam 'made a mistake' - would be very difficult - because he said it with divine intuition. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Also</strong>\nI once heard a mashal that in previous generations they 'saw' whereas in later generations they only 'heard'. Just imagine a vision of an intricate landscape with millions of details. When gazing upon that landscape - all those details are before you, tangible and clear. If however I were to ask my friend who saw that vision to explain to me what he saw - even if he heard and comprehended all of them - it's just not the same. </p>\n\n\n",

Chabad apparently doesn't think so as they have <a href=\"http://chabadinfo.com/index.php/newvideo/player/images/body_bg1.gif?url=article_en&id=21193\" rel=\"nofollow\">heavily promoted</a> one of their own, welterweight fighter Dmitriy Salita (35-1-1), since he became frum and turned pro 12 years ago.  (He's fighting former champion Hector Camacho Jr. in April in Brooklyn in a Showtime televised event.)</p>\n\n<p>Another fighter, former WBA light middleweight champ Yuri Foreman (29-2), is <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/rabbi-d-tenacity-foreman-mixes-religion-boxing-article-1.274221\" rel=\"nofollow\">reportedly</a> learning for smicha at the Iyyun Institute yeshiva in Brooklyn (under Rabbi Dov Ber Pinson) while he trains.  I think that Rabbi Pinson is also Chabad (although I'm not sure).</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a general prohibition -- subject to exceptions -- to inflict a wound on someone or one's self, and even if one did not inflict a wound, to hit someone in a hostile manner is a Torah prohibition.  Rambam, Hilchot Chovel U'Mazik 5:1.  </p>\n\n<p>Citing this Rambam, Rav Moshe Feinstein held that the mitzva \"V'Ahavta L'Reyacha Kamocha\" (Love your neighbor as yourself) would allow you to wound someone with his consent and for his benefit.  Iggrot Moshe, Choshen Mishpat 2:66.  Citing Bava Kama 91(b) (walking through thorns with uncovered legs to preserve clothing); Sanhedrin 89 (interpreting I Kings 20:35-36) and Sanhedrin 84b (permitted to perform blood-letting on father), Rav Moshe held that a girl could undergo plastic surgery because it would have a beneficial effect.  Accordingly, one could arguably cite this psak as a basis to permit prize-fighting since the two fighters consent to be injured so they can make money, although that would still leave open the question of whether the risk of permanent injury warranted the gain of any amount of money.</p>\n\n\n",

Nothing stops us from praying for a cure for a person's health without using their full Hebrew name.

This is\n  evident from the wording of the beracha — להתעטף בציציתto wrap in\n  tzitzis. The manner of wrapping is what is described as the wrapping\n  of the Yishmaelim which involves pulling the garment down over one’s\n  face. Ba’al HaItur disagrees and maintains that wrapping one’s head\n  is not  a prerequisite for the mitzvah. The wording of the pasuk is —\n  אשר תכסה בה that he will cover himself in it - and this teaches that\n  covering one’s body with the garment is sufficient to generate an\n  obligation of tzitzis and there is no need to cover one’s head.\n  Mishnah  Berurah סק\"ג follows  Ba’al  HaItur  and  writes  that\n  covering  one’s  body  is  wrapping  – עטוף Nevertheless,  he advises\n  that while davening one should wear his talis over his head  since  it\n  generates  submission  to  Hashem  and  leads  to of  Heaven ע'   מ\"ב \n  סק\"ד Furthermore,  in  Mishnah Berurah’s description of wrapping one’s\n  self after the beracha סק\"ד he  mentions  wrapping  the  talis  around\n  one’s  head  in order to fulfill the opinion of the Gaonim as well.\n  One must be  mindful,  however,  that  during  this  wrapping  the\n  talis must  be  around  one’s  body  as  well  for  if  one  were  to \n  wrap only  their  head  the  mitzvah  would  not  be  fulfilled. Those\n  who leave their talis folded and wrap it only around their neck do \n  not  fulfill  the  mitzvah  since  this  is  not  considered עיטוף\n  according  to  any  opinion מ\"ב  סק\"ג Shulchan  Aruch  HaRav כח:ח also\n  criticizes  those  people  who  following  the  beracha wrap  the \n  talis  only  around  their  head.  Ben  Ish  Chai, (שנה  א'  פרשת \n  בראשית  אות  ה')however,  writes  that  one  should wrap the talis\n  around his head and it appears that he is follow-ing the Gaonim’s\n  position that one must wrap his head.

The Jews clearly had other gold items, including other golden jewlery (ibid <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0235.htm#v22\" rel=\"nofollow\">35:22</a>). Is there any symbolism behind why earrings specifically were chosen? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>BS\"D, Hakham Eli Mansour makes this connection 'al pi HaRav Shimon Schwab in his shi'ur on Parashat Ki Tisa 5774 (<a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/parasha.aspx?id=485\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>, see 17:15-28:00).</p>\n\n<p>HaRav Mansour explains HaRav Schwab by starting with the fact that it was the men who gave the gold from their earrings to Aharon after their wives refused to hand over their jewelry for the purposes of 'Avodah Zarah (for which, he explains, Rosh Hodesh was dedicated to Jewish women). His support for this conclusion is the word \"Ozneihem\" in Shemot 32:3. HaRav Mansour goes on to ask why men were wearing earrings in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>He explains that, after miraculously hearing HaShem's voice with their own physical ears, the Jewish men wanted to adorn their ears with gold to underscore and remember the miracle (as, he explains, we do with hidurim of many of the mitzwot).</p>\n\n<p>Tangentially, he explains that earrings are a remembrance that we are slaves only to HaShem and that that is why a Jewish slave has his ear pierced on a doorpost for choosing to extend his slavery to another human being. Here, at Mt. Sinai, the Jewish men pierced their ears to honor and remember \"Anokhi HaShem Eloqeikha\".</p>\n\n<p>He concludes this section of his shi'ur by tying these teachings together to explain why Het Ha'Egel was such a grave sin. The men rushed to use the gold from the earrings they had, only days before, sanctified for the remembrance of hearing HaShem speak and command them to serve Him alone all in order to worship an idol. For this grave sin, they and their descendants came to deserve a severe punishment indeed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>All of the commentators understand that during these proceedings, Aharon tried to delay the process as much as possible, hoping that Moshe would eventually come and even negate it completely or that there will be refusal by others to give from their own belongings, etc. He tactfully used specific words to prolong the matter. In this vein, I would venture to say that earrings were the most commonly used adornment and would take the longest time to gather (this is perhaps alluded to in the Or Hachaim quoted below). Even the men wore earrings then (and in fact that alone was what was used to make the golden calf). See Pirkei Dirabbi Eliezer 45 and Tanchuma 21. </p>\n\n<p>The reason why not request <strong>everything</strong>, the Or Hachaim (Exodus 32:2) explains: \"[The verse says:] \"Break off\" - you and not they. \"Golden earrings\" - not other gold. \"Which are in the ears of\" - and not laying in a chest, and they should not put them on after [and subsequently break them off]. If this is not carried out, this hinders [the fulfillment of the instruction].\" Aaron was pretending he needed 'this and not that'. On the flipside though, he requested the most time-consuming activity; gathering the golden earrings.</p>\n\n<p>Symbolically speaking, Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg Shlita, Rosh Yeshiva of 'Od Yosef Chai', observes that letters of \"נזם\", the word used here for 'ring', can be rearranged into \"זמן\". There are two types of negative elements related to זמן, time; עזות דליפה and בושה דקליפה. In its very basic form it's the idea of always being early or always being late, but in a deeper sense it refers to other things, like being too aloof or being too involved in something. The sin of the golden calf was a misguided reaction to an observation the Children of Israel made about Moshe. He seemed to be too spiritually aloof, and indeed they were correct, for Moshe did not sense enough the sin they subsequently partook in and intervene (though upon realization he rectified it by destroying the tablets). This came from בושה דקליפה. As the first verse in the chapter states: וירא העם כי <strong>בשש</strong> משה לרדת מן ההר. Which literally means he delayed. But is also etymologically connected with this notion of בושה דקליפה. See <a href=\"http://www.malchuty.org/2011-01-20-01-37-36/2011-01-20-02-09-33/646-----q-----q.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for his exhaustive treatment of the matter.</p>\n\n\n",

Since i guess idol worship is just concrete version of <em>Shituff</em> as it can be manifested in many ways and not just Idol worship</p>\n\n<p>e.g following laws setup by a Hindu pseudo god sounds more <em>Shituff</em> blasphemous then actually worshiping the Hindu pseudo god.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Non-Jewish courts are referred to as <em>arka'ot</em> (ערכאות), although the precise etymology of this word is debated, and as <em>agoriyot</em> (אגוריות). There is a longstanding prohibition against having one's case heard in one, although nowhere does this prohibition have anything to do with <em>shituf</em>. The oldest source is the Talmud Bavli:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ט אומר כל מקום שאתה מוצא אגוריאות של עובדי כוכבים אע\"פ שדיניהם כדיני\n  ישראל אי אתה רשאי להיזקק להם שנאמר ואלה המשפטים אשר תשים לפניהם לפניהם\n  ולא לפני עובדי כוכבים דבר אחר לפניהם ולא לפני הדיוטות</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Tarfon says, \"Any place that you find non-Jewish courts\n  (<em>agoriyot</em>), even though their laws be the same as the laws of Israel,\n  you are not allowed to resort to them, since it says \"these are the\n  laws that you shall set before them\" (Exodus 21:1). Before <i>them</i>\n  and not before non-Jews. Alternatively, before <i>them</i> and not\n  before lay tribunals.</p>\n  \n  <p>• Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 88b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This passage is quoted in the Sheiltot of R' Ahai Gaon (שאילתא ב', בראשית), although it adds the stipulation that this is even if the non-Jewish courts are operating in accordance with <em>biblical</em> law (אע\"ג דקא דיינין דינא דאורייתא), and it gives the ruling in the name of Rabbi Meir instead of Rabbi Tarfon.</p>\n\n<p>The same prohibition is to be found twice in Midrash Tanchuma: Mishpatim §3 (where it is presented anonymously) and §6 (where it is given in the name of Rabbi Shim'on, but in which it is otherwise identical to the passage in bGittin 88b). The first of those two instances is especially interesting, since it continues as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שכל מי שמניח דייני ישראל והולך לפני אמות העולם כפר בהקדוש ברוך הוא\n  תחלה ואחרי כן כפר בתורה</p>\n  \n  <p>All who abandon Jewish judges and who present their case before\n  non-Jews are guilty at first of denying God, then later of denying the\n  Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>• Tanchuma, Mishpatim §3</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The passage then continues with an allegory: a doctor visits one sick man, and tells him that he may eat and drink what he pleases. He visits another, and gives him a specific diet. When questioned by the second man's family, he tells them that the first man is going to die, so what he eats and drinks is of no consequence. Likewise, the laws of the nations are of nothingness, while the stipulations of Israel lead one to the paths of life. The passage concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא לישראל אם עשיתם אתם את הדין ואין אתם מזדקקין לפני\n  אמות העולם אבנה לכם בית המקדש וישבו בה סנהדרין</p>\n  \n  <p>God tells Israel, \"If you render judgments for yourselves and do not\n  resort to non-Jewish courts, I will build a temple for you and the\n  Sanhedrin will sit within it\"</p>\n  \n  <p>• Tanchuma, <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you consult the mediaeval mefarshim on Exodus 21:1, you will find the same ruling (quoted from the Tanchuma and from Gittin 88b) in the commentaries of both Rashi and Ramban. Rashi's wording is of particular interest:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפניהם ולא לפני עובדי כוכבים ומזלות ואפילו ידעת בדין אחד שהם דנין אותו\n  כדיני ישראל אל תביאהו בערכאות שלהם שהמביא דיני ישראל לפני עובדי כוכבים\n  ומזלות מחלל את השם ומיקר את שם האלילים להשביחם</p>\n  \n  <p>Before <em>them</em>, but not before non-Jews. And even if you know that they\n  are operating with the same law that the Jews employ, do not bring him\n  to their courts (<em>arka'ot</em>), for whoever brings Jewish cases before\n  non-Jews desecrates the name of God, and elevates foreign gods with\n  praise.</p>\n  \n  <p>• Rashi, Exodus 21:1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As halakha, this ruling is to be found in the Rambam as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל הדן בדיני גוים ובערכאות שלהם אע\"פ שהיו דיניהם כדיני ישראל הרי זה\n  רשע וכאלו חרף והרים יד בתורת משה רבינו שנ' ואלה המשפטים אשר תשים\n  לפניהם לפניהם ולא לפני גוים לפניהם ולא לפני הדיוטות</p>\n  \n  <p>All those who try their cases in accordance with non-Jewish law or in\n  non-Jewish courts (<em>arka'ot</em>), even if their laws are as the laws of\n  Israel, is a wicked person and it is as though he insulted and struck\n  the Torah of Moses, since it says \"These are the laws that you should\n  place before them\". Before <em>them</em>, and not before non-Jews. Before\n  <em>them</em>, and not before lay tribunals.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Rambam, Hilkhot Sanhedrin 26:7</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, we find this ruling in the Tur and the Shulchan Arukh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור לדון בפני דייני עכו\"ם ובערכאות שלהם אפילו בדין שדנים כדיני ישראל\n  ואפילו נתרצו ב' בעלי דינים לדון בפניהם אסור וכל הבא לידון בפניהם הרי\n  זה רשע וכאלו חירף וגידף והרים יד בתורת מרע\"ה</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden to reach judgment before non-Jewish judges, or in\n  non-Jewish courts (<em>arka'ot</em>) - even in a matter that they judge like\n  Jewish judges do. Even if both plaintiffs want to be judged by them,\n  it is forbidden, and all who come to be judged before them are\n  accounted wicked, and it is as though they insulted and cursed and\n  struck the Torah of Moses.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 26:1.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the Rema (<em>ibid</em>.) for a situation in which you are allowed to use non-Jewish courts in order to place pressure upon one of the plaintiffs to desist, and see also the Rambam (<em>ibid</em>.) and the Tur/Shulchan Arukh (<em>op.cit.</em> 26:2) for situations in which non-Jewish courts can be used to place pressure upon Jewish plaintiffs who refuse to appear in a Jewish court.</p>\n\n<p>See also Menachem Elon, <em>Jewish Law: History, Sources, Principles</em> (Vol. I; trans. B. Auerbach and M.J. Sykes; Jerusalem: JPS, 1994), 13-18. He brings various examples of edicts and responsa, permitting (under certain circumstances) the uses of non-Jewish courts to \"decide on matters in which the general government had a special interest, such as real estate, the payment of promissory notes, government taxes, currency matters, and assault and battery\" (<em>op.cit</em>. 17).</p>\n\n<p>Not all Jewish authorities have accepted the use of such edicts, but amongst those who did are the Maharach (Rabbi Hayyim Eliezer ben Yitzhak, son of the Or Zarua), Nachalat Shiva (Rabbi Shmuel haLevi, 17th c. Poland), the Baal haNetivot (Rabbi Yaakov Lorberbaum, 18th-19th c. Poland), and the Rema. Those who disagree with such edicts include the Ramban, Rabbeinu Tam, the Rashbam, the Rashba, and (apparantly) the Maharam of Rothenburg. One example of a scholar who permits the use of non-Jewish judges, but only under certain circumstances (specifically, if both litigants name a particular non-Jewish judge whom they trust) is the Shakh (Choshen Mishpat 22:15).</p>\n\n\n",

The Yefeh Toar (on Midrash Rabba Parshas Behaloshcha and Vayera) questions this, and the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=9\">Tzemach Dovid</a> suggests he worked for Potifar for 11 years, and spent just two years in prison.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The three oldest sources that I can find on this question are Shemot Rabbah 7:1, Pirqei deRebi Eliezer 39 and Seder Olam Rabbah 2. They read as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדא הוא דכתיב בכל עצב יהיה מותר ודבר שפתיים אך למחסור. בכל הדברים שאדם\n  נושא ונותן בהם דברי תורה הוא נוטל עליהן שכר יכול אף בדברי בטלה כן\n  תלמוד לומר ודבר שפתיים אך למחסור. אתה מוצא לא היה יוסף ראוי לנתן בבית\n  האסורין אלא עשר שנים מפני שהוציא דבה על עשרת אחיו ועל ידי שאמר לשר\n  המשקים כי אם זכרתני אתך והזכרתני אל פרעה נתוסף לו עוד שתי שנים</p>\n  \n  <p>Here it is written, \"From all toil there is some gain, but idle\n  chatter is pure loss\" (Proverbs 14:23, JPS). Should one's business\n  matters concern words of Torah, he receives reward for them. It is\n  likewise with words of idleness, as it says: \"but idle chatter is pure\n  loss\". So you find that Joseph was only deserving of being placed in\n  prison for ten years, since he delivered an evil report of his ten\n  brothers, but due to the fact that he said to the chief cupbearer,\n  \"But think of me... mentioning me to Pharaoh\" (Genesis 40:14, JPS), a\n  further two years were added to his sentence.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Shemot Rabbah 7:1</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>והביאה עליו האשה עלילות דברים ונחבש בבית האסורים עשר שנים</p>\n  \n  <p>And the woman brought false charges against him and he was locked up\n  in the prison for ten years.</p>\n  \n  <p>[Rabbi David Luria (19th c. Lithuanian), in his peirush on PRE, suggests that this is a reference to the length of time that Joseph spent in prison <em>before</em> the extra two years were added.]</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Pirqei deRebi Eliezer 39</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>ירד יוסף למצרים ועשה בבית פוטיפרע י\"ב חדשים שנא' ויהי מאז הפקיד אותו\n  וגו' בבית מפני החמה ובשדה מפני הצינה ועשה בבית האסורים י\"ב שנה שנא'\n  ענו בכבל רגליו וגו' עד עת בא דברו וגומר</p>\n  \n  <p>Joseph went down to Egypt and worked in Potiphar's house for twelve\n  months, as it says: \"And from the time that [the Egyptian] put him in\n  charge... [the blessing of the Lord was upon everything that he owned,\n  in the house and outside]\" (Genesis 39:5, JPS). In the house because\n  of the sun [ie: the summer]; and outside because of the cold [ie: the\n  winter]. And he worked in the prison for twelve years, as it says:\n  \"His feet were subjected to fetters... until his prediction came\n  true...\"(Psalm 105:18-19, JPS).</p>\n  \n  <p>[The word for \"his feet\", רגליו, is so spelt in the text but is to be\n  read as \"his foot\", רגלו. According to Rabbi David Luria (Pirqei\n  deRebi Eliezer 39:29), the midrash is deriving ten years from the\n  value of the extra <em>yodh</em> in the ketiv. For a similar drash, see the Baal haTurim, Genesis 39:20, who derives Joseph's ten years in prison - before the addition of a subsequent two - from the\n  extra <em>yodh</em> in the ketiv there.)</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Seder Olam Rabbah 2</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question, at the time of Joseph's arrest he was:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seder Olam Rabbah</strong>: 18 years old;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shemot Rabbah</strong>: 18 years old;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pirqei deRebi Eliezer</strong>: 20 years old (acc. to R' David Luria, 18 years old).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=513\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baal HaTurim</a> says he was in prison a total of 12 years</p>\n\n\n",

But this verse tells us that Poti-phera was a priest, while in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0139.htm#1\">39:1</a> Potiphar was the captain of the guard.</p>\n\n<p>If Potiphar and Poti-phera were the same person, then either (a) the same man was both captain of the guard for Paro and a priest, or (b) he was one and then became the other later.

But in connection with Yosef marrying his daughter the Torah emphasizes his being the priest of On, to teach that Pharaoh elevated Yosef so much that he was able to marry a daughter of one of the priests of Egypt, someone who very great in wealth and honor.</p>\n\n<p>An additional explanation that he brings is that since it is difficult to believe that Yosef would marry into a family where the father was a priest of idol worship, Chazal interpreted the word כהן as a description of greatness, and he brings several posukim in the Tanach where this word means that. Hence, Potiphera the Great One of On does not contradict his being called the chief executioner, and the reason for describing him differently from one place to another is similar to what was explained in the previous paragraph.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Potiphar was the \"sar tabachim\" (B'reshit/Genesis 37:36), usually translated in English as \"captain of the guard\".  Sar means chief or prince. Tabach means executioner or guard, or a cook who cuts up meat: a butcher. As one of the roles for priests was to sacrifice animals and cut up the meat, it is not unimaginable that tabach might have been another word to refer to a priest (normally \"Kohen\", of course). Potiphar was a \"saris\" (eunuch), which seems more likely to me to describe a priest than a guard.\nHence I suggest a more accurate reading was that Potiphar was chief of all the priests of Egypt, as On the sun god was a major Egyptian deity. This would make it likely that Potiphar and Potiphera could be the same person; and that therefore Yosef/Joseph and Asenath could had been well acquainted before being married. </p>\n\n<p>As Potiphar was a eunuch, and was unable to have children, this may perhaps support the view that Potiphera had adopted a daughter born to Dinah and Shechem in Cana'an, who had previously come to Egypt, and named her Asenath. If this view is correct, Adonai would thus have brought both Yosef and Asenath from Cana'an to the very same household in Egypt, to ultimately become the ancestors of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mandatory evacuation on Shabbat: what can and can't you do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A major storm hit New England starting this past Friday.  While people knew this was coming and precautions were already in place, apparently (according to a news article I read tonight) some areas were declared for mandatory evacuation on Saturday morning.  This led me to wonder what one must, may, and must not do in such a situation (assuming no immediate threat to life/health, just a \"get out of here\" decree):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Should (may? must?) you use a vehicle if it will get you out more quickly, or do you leave on foot?</p></li>\n<li><p>What may you take with you?

(The talmudic discussion of the burning house seems to be about removing things a short distance, which is not this case.  In an evacuation, even if there's a still-intact eiruv you're almost certainly going to go past the boundary.)</p></li>\n<li><p>If you don't know a matter of halacha you should of course CYLR.  When you're in the midst of the situation on Shabbat, is it better to phone your rabbi (guaranteed <em>melacha</em>) in order to minimize <em>further</em> violations, or to use your best judgment and risk more, unintended violations?  (Assume you don't have time to walk to your rabbi and back.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbanan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RKB%20Hurricane%20Article.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">An informative article by R. Kenneth Brander</a> (h/t DoubleAA and Ze'ev Felsen) addresses some halachic issues of severe weather on Shabbat, but doesn't specifically address (non-medical) evacuation issues.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have a hard time imagining a situation in which you're being forced to evacuate but there <strong>isn't</strong> some recognizable threat to life. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>As A.L. said, in the case of pikuach nefesh, you are clearly allowed to do anything to save yourself or someone else, even travelling outside the techum shabbos. If they is something that <em>would</em> be a pikuach nefesh, but there is a safek as to whether there is actually a person in danger, such as a collapsed building that may be empty or the person may already be dead, you are still allowed to do anything involved with potentially saving that life until it is definite whether there is or isn't a person in danger. I believe the gemara discusses a case of an advancing army threatening a city, but never actually attacking. See Shemirat Shabbos Kehilchatah chapter 32 for an in depth treatment of this. Too many mekoros to post here. He even says that even if you fail to save a life or it was rendered unhelpful (e.g.: the person died, the sakanah wasn't as threatening as thought, etc.) you have still performed a mitzvah and you still retain the reward for keeping yom tov (and, presumably shabbos, but he only mentions yom tov). </li>\n<li><p>A natural disaster like a wildfire would fall under the same category as the gemara mentions, and you can do everything that it discusses vis a vis saving tefillin, food, clothes, etc. As long as we aren't talking about an actual fire or other widespread property damage (see: New Orleans), then the only objects you would be able to take with you would be , hypothetically, what you're wearing. There is no dispensation for transporting objects when total loss is not involved - if your house will survive the storm, so will most everything in it. That being said, there are specific methods for carrying past the techum on foot mentioned in the gemara itself - a carrying line where each person just hands off to the next so no one moves 4 amos means no one is technically violating (carrying is split so no one engaging in the full issur - two people holding a single shirt while walking in public are patur). </p>\n\n<p>2 (cont). Additionally, if you don't have to walk through a karmelis to get to your vehicle and an evacuation is ordered where you can drive, you might be able to freely move any non-muktzeh items to your car before driving, assuming you're not creating additional violations by turning on lights by opening the door (you could leave the door open while you load to circumvent this). Your car carrying the load is equivalent to a laden donkey travelling on shabbos, and the gemara explicitly discusses a person putting his wallet on to the donkey before shabbos while in public and leading the donkey into his courtyard before loosening the saddlebags to drop on the floor. Again, this is in a case where travel by care would be permitted - pikuach nefesh - so the techum here isn't an issue. However, Shmiras Shabbos 40:64 (and several footnotes) would seem to imply the opposite - that increasing the burning of gas through additional load in the vehicle is forbidden. Interestingly, this reasoning would <strong>not</strong> apply to an electric car (and possibly a hybrid with a gas generator and electric motors) where no havarah is being performed directly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding phoning the rabbi, it isn't entirely clear whether it classifies as a full de'oraysa or a de'rabannan, <strong><em>but would the rabbi even know to answer the phone?</em></strong> With only the potential of them answering (because, let's face it, the rav has also been ordered to evacuate) the value of calling is doubtful. The Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchatah (chapter 40:1) states that anyone delaying to ask a question for even a <strong>suspected</strong> sakanah is considered a murderer. If the situation is so dire that you cannot spend time walking to the rabbi, then it is dire enough that any accidental increase in violations is acceptable to save lives. See the cases in the Shmiras Shabbos mentioned earlier.(32:7, 40:1, 40:62). The language makes clear that you cannot deliberately increase violations of shabbos, but accidental violations and one's performed in better judgement that turned out to be unnecessary shouldn't burden your consciousness.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please provide an example situation of an evacuation where you can't spend time to consult a rav but there isn't pikuach nefesh.</p>\n\n\n",

In 33:16–<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%92_%D7%99%D7%96\" rel=\"noreferrer\">17</a> we see <em>Yaakov</em> going to <em>Sukos</em>, where the <em>g'mara</em> (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>M'gila</em> 17</a>) says he spent the summer season. Thus, he got there the day before <em>Pesach</em>. That happened the same day he had met <em>Esav</em>.</p>\n<p>The previous night, the night of the fourteenth of <em>Nisan</em>, thus, <em>Yaakov</em> met the \"man\" (or angel). On the thirteenth, then, he sent presents to <em>Esav</em>. This is the start of chapter 32. 32:1 indicates that this is the day after the events of the end of chapter 31. Thus, <em>Lavan</em> said \"<em>Ashre</em>\" on the 12th of <em>Nisan</em>.</p>\n<p>What day of the week was this? Well, <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/T0131\" rel=\"noreferrer\">31</a>:24 says it was the day after he got to <em>Gil'ad</em> Mountain, and <em>Rashi</em> to 31:23 says that <em>that</em> was the day after <em>Lavan</em> had found out <em>Yaakov</em>'s departure — which, 31:32 says, was בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁלִישִׁי, Tuesday. So it was Thursday, the twelfth of <em>Nisan</em>.</p>\n<p>Of course, Thursday, the twelfth of <em>Nisan</em>, is a fast day, <em>taanis b'choros</em>.</p>\n<h3><em>Lavan</em> was part of a group of seven people:</h3>\n<p>This occurred thirteen years after <em>Yaakov</em> married, so none of his sons were <em>bar mitzva</em>. However, in the presence of nine adults, one boy can count toward a <em>minyan</em> (<em>Orach Chayim</em> 55:4). In 31:51, <em>Lavan</em> realizes \"וְעֵדָה הַמַּצֵּבָה, the monument makes a <em>minyan</em>\" (as we see in the <em>g'mara</em> (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%92_%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>M'gila</em> 23</a>) that \"עֵדָה\" means \"<em>minyan</em>\"). Thus, the monument, <em>Yaakov</em>, and one of his sons made the <em>minyan</em>, so <em>Lavan</em> had seven people. <em>Lavan</em> was pointing out that he had a <em>minyan</em> because he realized now that you need one for \"<em>Vay'chal</em>\".</p>\n<h3><em>Lavan</em>'s seven people were all fasting:</h3>\n<p>This we see from <em>Rashi</em> to 31:23, who translates \"אֶחָיו\", literally \"his brothers\", as \"his relatives\". What could have compelled <em>Rashi</em> to do so? It must be <em>Rashi</em> knew <em>Lavan</em>'s \"brothers\" were not really his brothers, because they were all <em>b'choros</em>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>We find the answer <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0130.htm#13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">elsewhere in the parshah</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֹּאמֶר לֵאָה--בְּאָשְׁרִי, כִּי אִשְּׁרוּנִי בָּנוֹת</p>\n<p>And Le'ah said \"'Ashrei,' because my daughters made me happy.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We therefore see that when one's daughters make one happy, he (or she) should say Ashrei.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when Lavan is trying to tell how much he loves his daughters and is upset at Ya'akov having taken them (31:26-28), he first made sure to show that he loved his daughters (in verse 25) by saying Ashrei.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You are thinking of the wrong Ashrei (Psalms 145).

Immediately prior to Lavan's saying Ashrei, Yaakov had set up the Mishkan, God's house, in Persia (פרס).

Another rav, Rabbi Rod Glowgower told  me 25 years ago, that he was reluctant to grant shul membership to a female convert of \"Reb Shlomo.\" And Rav Moshe Feinstein reportedly wrote an opinion critical of him.

In light of the public allegations, have there been any bans on his music or rabbinic acts such as conversions?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Bruce, may you live and be well to 120, but I'm reminded here of someone's definition of a \"Jewish question\": someone gets up and makes a big statement, then just raises the pitch at the very end so it sounds like a question.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what you mean by \"predator\", I don't know what the allegations are, I don't care. Let's talk theory here. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein described a certain individual, and sets out the following concepts:</p>\n\n<p>If someone actively rejected the basic tenets of Orthodox Judaism (or publicly violated the Sabbath while staring the rabbi in the eye, or worshipped idols), then we would invalidate a Torah scroll he wrote. Rabbi Feinstein says this is limited to the realm of religious objects. We are perfectly allowed to use -- and refer to by name -- Von Neumann computer architecture, or the Salk vaccine, or the like; regardless of how much of Judaism John Von Neumann or Jonas Salk knew or kept. (Concept is Feinstein, examples are mine.) Rabbi Feinstein writes that the music played at Jewish weddings is not an inherrently ritual object, hence it's merely inadvisable, not prohibited, to play music composed by a heretic at a Jewish wedding. </p>\n\n<p>If, however, an individual in theory believes in everything, but succumbs to various vices, then in other aspects of halacha they are not invalidated. The subject of Rabbi Feinstein's responsum falls under this category, hence his music is perfectly permissible at weddings, even for the very pious. </p>\n\n<p>From reading this I would gather that new allegations would not \"invalidate\" the music. </p>\n\n<p>Now if we believe that an individual truly victimized many people and by acknowledging him we will cause anguish to the victims, or give our community a black eye as it appears we condone horrible behavior, then that's a question of between-man-and-fellow-man. You'd have to know the particulars of the case. I know of a synagogue with a retired rabbi who was later convicted of serious offenses; the synagogue struggled with whether to remove every trace of his name from every letterhead and plaque. These are tough questions, but they're matters of nuance. There's no open-and-shut mishnah brurah on this.</p>\n\n<p>As for conversions performed, again one would have to know the particulars of each case performed. The Talmud describes how a man served as High Priest of the Temple for decades and decades before leaving the path of mainstream Judaism. Humans are complicated; if G-d wanted simple, reliable creatures, He had plenty of angels! If a rabbi on the panel had rejected Orthodox theology at the time of the conversion, that's one story. If he struggled with personal demons, that's not so simple. Rabbi Hershel Schachter recalls hearing of Jewish couple who sought to retroactively dissolve their marriage, rather than divorce, so she could marry a Cohen. The argument was that one of the rabbis witnessing their wedding later checked into rehab for sex addiction and had been seeing women-of-ill-repute on a regular basis. (G-d have mercy!) Besides other, more-gaping holes in their argument, Rabbi Schachter wasn't sure if that would be enough to invalidate the ceremony. (Though the bar is higher for \"rabbinic judges\" than for witnesses.)</p>\n\n<p>As for adopting someone's teachings, well Rambam says we accept truth from wherever its source. If someone tells me \"Pizza Yehopitz is the tastiest pie in town\" (let's assume the kashrut is unquestioned), I'm welcome to try it regardless of that fellow's morals. Certainly one should weigh the totality of a person's teachings and deeds before adopting all their teachings as a <em>raisson d'etre</em>, but that should be nothing new.</p>\n\n\n",

(However, see the <em>Bi'ur HaGra</em> on <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> OC 240:8, s.v. ויש מפרשים, who interprets the <em>Hagahos Maimoniyos</em> as referring to the manner as well). </p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, physical contact is considered an essential aspect of marital relations, which is why divorce is mandated if either the husband or the wife demands that they remain clothed during relations (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> EH 76:13; cf. commentaries ad loc., <em>Magen Avraham</em> OC 240:22).

    "content": "# What opportunities do Orthodox women have to learn and participate in their communities outside the home?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've visited several Orthodox communities but never been part of one.  One of the things that has always been a stumbling-block for me is the role of women.  Here are two things I've observed about the communities I've visited -- whether they're typical I don't know:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Women are more home- and child-focused, not synagogue-focused.  Few come to services to pray, and of course there are halachic issues that impede full participation.  Discussion and activity at the kiddush tend to be about the kids.</p></li>\n<li><p>Learning opportunities for adult women are limited -- there are some women's classes on a restricted set of topics (usually home- and child-related) and the occasional mixed-gender lecture, but a woman who, say, wants to learn gemara is generally going to be out of luck.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As a woman with no children, a professional (techie) career, and a thirst for knowledge, who currently studies and socialized with mixed-gender groups, I've felt out of place in my visits so far.  But maybe there are important things I'm missing, that you have to be an insider or a regular to understand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> if I wanted to become more involved in an Orthodox community, then (a) what options for meaningful adult-oriented participation (especially learning, worship, social) are likely to be available to me, and (b) assuming this varies, what if any are the general patterns (e.g. such-and-such group tends to be better for X, thus-and-such for Y)?  I know there are different groups within Orthodoxy; locally we have Modern Orthodox, Lubavich, Young Israel, a place that's called \"black hat\" (not sure what it is formally), and some others.  If I wanted to look for a community where someone like me would fit in, where should I look?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I've lived in four different countries, and in many different orthodox communities, and the dynamics were always different. First of all, in any orthodox community, social interaction between males and females will be limited to an extent not seen in non-orthodox communities. The communities I have seen, however, each had an established \"nshei\", which is a local womens group which organizes shiurim and social get-togethers of all kinds. The frequency and type of nshei meetings usually depends on the drive of the women (or woman) running it. Every place is different, and you should check out what is available in the area where you live.</p>\n\n<p>As far as learning, although it is true that in general orthodox (and especially ultra-orthodox) women's learning endeavours will be on a somewhat lower level (mostly caused by the inevitable direction most of their lives take; marriage, kids, home etc) it seems that those women who have a thirst of knowledge have found how to quench that thirst. There are several \"Rebbetzins\" who write columns in various orthodox newspapers and magazines whose level in erudition in Jewish thought and learning is impressively high. It may be a good idea to contact some of them and ask them how they did it!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, best of luck!</p>\n\n\n",

For the month of Cheshvan, the heavenly voice says <em>\"Sarah Imeinu Meisa\"</em> (\"Sarah our matriarch died\"), and Haman abandons that month, just like all the others. Apparently, Haman sees Sarah's death as a protecting merit for the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Why is the death of a tzaddik/tzaddekes a \"protection\" for that month?<br>\nAnd why doesn't Haman see Moshe's death as a merit for Adar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Halevi_Alkabetz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz</a> (author of Lecha Dodi) wrote a commentary of the Megilla called \"Manos Halevi\".

Whereas, after Sarah passed away, her place was filled by Rivka.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yonosan Eibeshitz answers (Yaaros Devash vol. 1 Drush 3 \"Veheni Oid Taam\") that Haman reasoned (in his distorted understanding) that if Moshe Rabbeynu who was an expert in sorcery could do nothing to prevent his death, this is a bad sign for the Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The whole lottery scene <em>is</em> really lifted straight from Midrash. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24889&pgnum=47\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midrash Esther Rabbasi</a>, to be exact. But the tape adds the whole dialog between Haman and the heavenly voice. In the Midrash, the dialog is between G-d and the angels representing the days of the week and the months of the year.</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash says that the reason it didn't land on Tammuz or Av was that the months' Ministering Angels \"cried out\" before G-d, saying that the troubles that had been inflicted on the Jews in those months had already been enough. The Anaf Yosef there (quoting <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?sits=1&req=14493&st=%u05D0%u05D3%u05E8%20%u05E8%u05D0%u05E9%u05D5%u05DF\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Yonasan Eibeshitz</a>) explains that this is the rule of \"לֹא תָקוּם פַּעֲמַיִם צָרָה\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1901.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nochum 1:9</a>), and since ששקולה מיתתן של צדיקים כשריפת בית אלהינו (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=18b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosh Hashana 18b</a>) Sarah's death was effectively a defense for Cheshvan to use, saying that \"I've already given the Jews my fair share of troubles.\"</p>\n\n<p>So why did the lot fall on Adar, if Moshe's death would protect it? According to R' Yonasan, it's simple. Moshe died in a leap year. <strong><em>In Adar Sheini</em></strong>. Haman wanted to kill the Jews, also in a leap year, <em>but in Adar Rishon</em>. Of course, Haman forgot that Moshe was <em>born</em> in Adar Rishon, so when his lots were cast and came up as Adar Rishon, he thought nothing of it. But the merit of Moshe's birth protected the Jews in that month.</p>\n\n\n",

However it's clear that לבסומי is actually a reference to the word סמים which means drugs.</p>\n\n<p>Other translations for לבסומי are \"sweet things\", and \"sing agreeably\". <a href=\"http://joshyuter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Drinking-on-Purim.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ref</a></p>\n\n<p>Clearly the intent of the Gemara is that a person should make brownies laced with drugs, and eat them until they spontaneously sing.</p>\n\n<p>This conveniently fulfills all the dictums of Purim at once: Drinking, feasting and making merry.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><em>Warning: The following answer contains elements of actual Torah and is not meant to be taken <strong>entirely</strong> in jest.</em></p>\n\n<p>It says in T'hillim (19:9): פִּקּוּדֵי יְהוָה יְשָׁרִים, מְשַׂמְּחֵי-לֵב. The Radak comments that Torah gladdens the heart, namely the intellect:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הם משמחי לב, כי החכם ישמח על שכלו. וכאשר יגבר על הגוף וינהגהו בדרכי השכל, אין שמחה בעולם כשמחה ההיא, והיא שמחת הנפש. לפיכך אמר: משמחי לב, ולא אמר משמחי האדם, כי האדם ישמח לתאות העולם, אבל השכל, והוא הלב, לא ישמח כי אם בדרכי שכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet, we see from T'hillim (104:15) that wine gladdens the heart, and the reference here does not seem to be to the intellect: וְיַיִן יְשַׂמַּח לְבַב אֱנוֹשׁ.</p>\n\n<p>What's the difference? The mishna in B'rachos (9:5) expounds: בכל לבבך בשני יצריך ביצר טוב וביצר רע. Thus we see that לְבַב indicates that wine allows one to gladden the totality of their being, including the <em>yetzer hatov</em> and the <em>yetzer hara</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The gemara (M'gillah 7b) writes that on Purim one should drink festively: מיחייב איניש לבסומי בפוריא עד דלא ידע בין ארור המן לברוך מרדכי. However, because of the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14794/1442\">unfortunate incident</a> recorded immediately after this, many rishonim and acharonim follow the Orchos Chaim and rule we don't have to get sooooo drunk. Still, they write, one should drink יותר מלימודו, more than his studies.</p>\n\n<p>Why does the drinking have to exceed the learning? The rest of the year, we serve HaShem with joy by achieving שמחת הנפש, with our יצר טוב. However, on Purim we fulfill עבדו את השם בשמחה in the manner of לאהבה את השם א-להכם ולעבדו בכל לבבכם , with the entirety of our being. Why is Purim a special opportunity for this? </p>\n\n<p>In the time of the Purim story, the Jews attended the feast of Achashveirosh. The feast was devoted to celebrating the ruins of the Jewish Temple and degrading its holy items. Achashveirosh himself brazenly wore the priestly vestments. The Jews should have sensed with the totality of their being that something was amiss; the celebration of Achashveirosh should have disturbed a Jew to his very core. Instead, what was the focus? The fact that technical halachos about the food at the seudah were observed (Megillah 12a). For this reason, that generation of Jews was nearly destroyed (ibid.).</p>\n\n<p>In those times, the Jews corrupted their Torah learning by using it to justify gladdening themselves in a blasphemous celebration. We rectify that error by drinking festively more than we study; we allow the totality of ourselves to emerge free from the restraints of the intellect and joyously serve HaShem with שמחה, with all our heart, בכל לבבנו בשני יצרינו.</p>\n\n\n",

But if nothing else would exist, if you could ponder that, then he would exist anyway, not be nonexistent due to their nonexistence. For all existing things require him, but he, blessed is he, doesn't require them or any one of them.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, his truth is not like the truth of any one of them. Thus, the prophet said [Jer. 10] \"God, god, is truth\": he alone is truth, nothing else has truth like his truth.

And God said moreover unto Moses: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations. (Sh'mos 3:14-15)</p>\n<p>And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed: 'The LORD, the LORD, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation.' (Sh'mos 34:6-7)</p>\n<p>God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent: when He hath said, will He not do it? or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?

    "content": "# Does a poor person have to give Maaser?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone can't finish the month financially, and has to borrow or take gifts in order to feed his family, does he still have to give Maaser from his salary?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>First of all, the Biblical mitzvah of maaser has to do with produce; the contemporary version of the mitzvah, maaser kesafim, where one gives 10% of his income, is a minhag or at least of Rabbinic origin, according to <a href=\"http://waterburyyeshiva.org/highlights/2010/08/hilchos-maaser-kesafim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">most poskim</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara, at Kesubos 50a, states that one cannot give double-maaser (20% of one's income) if it would cause him to be impoverished, however, there are <a href=\"http://waterburyyeshiva.org/highlights/2010/08/hilchos-maaser-kesafim-part-ii/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exceptions</a> to this rule.</p>\n\n<p>There is a split among the sources whether a poor person must give maaser.  Some rule strictly and require maaser even of the poor unless they can't even purchase bread and water, others take the position that if one has to rely upon others to satisfy basic needs, and has no luxuries, then he need not give maaser.  See Teshuvos V’Hanhagos 1:560, Kuntros Kol Torah Choberes 39 B’Shem R’ Shlomo Zalmen Aurbauch Zt”l.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemara is quite clear that the poor should nevertheless give tzedakah (which is a separate mitzvah from maaser).  At Gittin 7a-b, Rabbi Avira, interpreting Nachum 1:12 which states: \"If they are complete, or many, even so they will be cut\" - states:  \"if one sees that his income is scarce, he should give Tzedakah from it, and all the more so, if his income is large!\"  The Gemara cites its agreement stating: \"If one trims his possessions and gives Tzedakah, he is saved from punishment in Gehinom.\"  Continuing the reading of Nachum 1:12, \"And I afflicted you,\" Mar Zutra finds that proof for the point that \"even a poor person supported by Tzedakah should give Tzedakah.\"  And from Nachum 1:13, where G-d continues and says \"I will not afflict you any more,\" Rav Yosef finds this to be a proof that the poor will be rewarded for giving charity because he will cease being poor.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, if one thinks he might be poor enough to be exempt from maaser, he should consult his local rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to give too much.  The gemara, at Ketuvos 50a, says that one should not give more than a fifth of their income (double maaser) lest he comes to be a charity case himself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>About 10 Years ago, I asked a similar question to a posek by the name of Rabbi Yonasan Wiener in Jerusalem and he replied \"if you can't make ends meet, you're not obligated in maaser.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, I read in a book on Rabbi Pinchas Sheinberg that a couple with a very difficult financial situation went to ask him whether they were obligated to take maaser.</p>\n\n<p>He replied, \"no, but I don't know how you can get out of your difficult financial situation without the segula of taking maaser.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Talk to your rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>We rule that tithing of funds is a very meritorious practice, but not an all-out obligation. The Talmud prohibits one to give too much, lest they impoverish themselves and become a recipient.</p>\n\n<p>As I'd heard in a speech on maaser kesafim from Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz (and see the late Cyril Domb's book), feeding one's family comes first. Consult your rabbi if part, or all, of your tithing funds should go back to your own home.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch does discuss giving a token sum per year, to show that we belong to a people that believe in kindness, but that's not very much.</p>\n\n\n",

My first reaction was, \"I thought the melody many shuls use for Adon Olam was an old French marching song.\"  My second thought was that in Modern Orthodox synagogues, I occasionally did heard the liturgy sung to an occassional pop tune, and that Lenny Solomon had written an entire album of Beatles melodies to words from the siddur.  But then again, I've heard rabbis say that Schlock Rock, Variations, and the like, are more suited for baalei tshuva than Jews from a yeshivish background.  Then I remembered the controversy when Lipa Schmeltzer adapted a pop song for his song \"Uman, Hey,\" although I frankly never heard the original. Also, pop music sometimes creeps into our Jewish musical vocabulary unknowingly.  My son-in-law tells the story of his Rebbe who was humming a Simon and Garfunkel tune and had no idea that it was a pop culture since he had thought it to be from Jewish liturgical music.

    "content": "# Magazine not delivered - what are they responsible for?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone has a subscription to a Jewish weekly or magazine or newspaper (for example: Mishpacha, Binah, Ami, Jewish Press, Yated, Hamodia, etc.) and they are supposed to deliver on a specific day of the week. For some reason it was not delivered (not a situation beyond their control) what is the magazine or papers responsibility? My question is that usually a subscription is cheaper than the store price. Can they just tell you we will extend your subscription for a week and pick it up in the store this week, or should they really reimburse you your extra cost and time of purchase? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The following is a restating of an article originally published in Hamodia and reprinted at <a href=\"http://www.businesshalacha.com/articles/home-delivery-it%E2%80%99s-your-lawn-it-yours#_edn10\" rel=\"nofollow\">businesshalacha.com</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Lets break this question down:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If someone has a subscription to a Jewish weekly or magazine or newspaper (for example: Mishpacha, Binah, Ami, Jewish Press, Yated, Hamodia, etc.) and they are supposed to deliver on a specific day of the week. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A subscription is not necessarily a contract between a buyer and seller, because under halacha, you cannot own something that has yet to exist (חושן משפט, ס' ר\"ט, סע' ד).  Therefore, when one purchases a newspaper or magazine subscription, one does not actually attain any ownership of the yet to be published papers/magazines. Rather, a newspaper or magazine subscription is a commitment made by the publisher to provide to the customer the newspapers that will be published in the future in return for a fee. Commitments to provide future goods are not always legally enforceable, but if the subscriber and publisher continue with this unwritten agreement, then the advanced payment made by the subscriber constitutes payment for the purchase of the goods as well as their delivery.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For some reason it was not delivered...what is the magazine or papers responsibility?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ordinarily, when one has a contract to purchase an item, the contract is completed when there is a <i>kinyan</i> -- an exchange of the purchased property (חושן משפט, ס' קפ\"ט). But lets say that Homodia typically comes to you by a delivery boy who throws a copy onto your driveway.  Does that complete the transaction?  Is the seller's responsibility over, no matter what happens to the paper thereafter? If the paper is thrown into a guarded area, say within a fenced yard watched over by my fearless cocker spaniel, then a kinyan would have occurred and the paper has met its responsibility (חושן משפט, ס' ר', סע' א).  But if the paper was just left on the driveway, there has been no kinyan.  Arguably, the paper would be responsibile to replace the paper if it was stolen from your driveway.  However, it can also be argued that the paper, acting upon custom, made a delivery after throwing the paper on your driveway and had no further interest in the paper, making the paper ownerless (and by implication, fair game for anyone to pick up).  As a matter of maintaining good will, the publisher should replace the missing paper, but whether it has an obligation to, is the subject of an ongoing dispute among halachic authorities. (הגות רע\"א חושן משפט, ס' ק\"כ, סע' א', וע' באמרי בינה הנ\"ל , ןבנתיבות המשפט ס' קצ\"ד, ס\"ק ד)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My question is that usually a subscription is cheaper than the store price. Can they just tell you we will extend your subscription for a week and pick it up in the store this week, or should they really reimburse you your extra cost and time of purchase? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As noted above, one cannot purchase something that doesn't yet exist, and the purchase isn't completed until delivery is properly made.  Based on that, the money you fronted to the magazine/newspaper is essentially a loan for which the publisher can either repay through a refund or by giving you the magazine or newspaper you subscribed to receive.  Since your contract was that payment (ie the magazine) on the loan was due as of a certain day, you can demand that you get a full refund or immediate delivery (see Rabbi Joseph Stern, <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/ribis4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Ribis: A Halachic Anthology,\" § 1(F)</a> (discussion of prepayment for services)); therefore an extension of the subscription is at your discretion, not the publisher's.  I think that if they tell you to go to the store, then they have done nothing to satisfy their obligation.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure if the prayer was intended to be used in the bedtime sh'ma.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The obligation to forgive those who have hurt you stems from the prohibition of ona'as devarim (verbal abuse) (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=141\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnah Brurah 606:1</a>). It would therefore make sense that one is only obligated to forgive another Jew, since the prohibition of ona'as devarim is only to a Jew (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0325.htm#17\" rel=\"nofollow\">VaYikra 25:17</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Note: See the comments to this answer.</p>\n\n\n",

It derived from an older practice of offering turkey to one's parents: people thought, <em>Why offer it to our parents? We can offer it to God!</em>, and did so. The older practice of offering one's parents turkey is alluded to in the verse in Genesis (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%96_%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow\">37:3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיִשְׂרָאֵל אָהַב אֶת יוֹסֵף מִכָּל בָּנָיו כִּי בֶן זְקֻנִים הוּא לוֹ וְעָשָׂה לוֹ כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>En hamikra omer ela \"Darsheni!\".</em> This verse makes no sense on first read — what does having a beard have to do with a shirt? — and must be read at a deeper level.</p>\n\n<p>\"אהב\" is clearly an acronym for \"אכל הודו בלילות\", \"ate turkey at night\", so the verse reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jacob ate turkey, from all his sons, at night with Joseph. Because his son [=Joseph] was bearded, he made him a shirt of stripes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"shirt of stripes\" that Jacob made for Joseph was actually a sort of bib to prevent the barbecue sauce from getting in his beard. It had stripes so that stains would not appear as visibly as they would on a bib that was all one color.</p>\n\n<p>Later, after the time of King David, the custom evolved further. People stopped offering turkey wholly to God and started eating parts of it, as with a <em>korban sh'lamim</em>. Eventually, they stopped offering it at all, and just ate it themselves, from which derives the modern practice of eating turkey on Thanksgiving.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Turkey is not indigenous to the old world, so it only became possible to fulfill this forward-looking directive in recent centuries.  While most still use chicken for <em>kapparot</em>, I am told (by Americans) that it is more proper to use a turkey now that we are able.

Therefore, [Leviticus 19:12] states, regarding [taking] an oath in vain: \"[for] you are desecrating the name of your Lord; I am God.\" If he transgresses amidst ten Jews, he desecrates [God's] name in public.</p>\n  \n  <p>Conversely, anyone who refrains from committing a sin or performs a mitzvah for no ulterior motive, neither out of fear or dread, nor to seek honor, but for the sake of the Creator, blessed be He - as Joseph held himself back from his master's wife - sanctifies God's name.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 11<br>\n  There are other deeds which are also included in [the category of] the desecration of [God's] name, if performed by a person of great Torah stature who is renowned for his piety - i.e., deeds which, although they are not transgressions, [will cause] people to speak disparagingly of him. This also constitutes the desecration of [God's] name.</p>\n  \n  <p>For example, a person who purchases [merchandise] and does not pay for it immediately, although he possesses the money, and thus, the sellers demand payment and he pushes them off; a person who jests immoderately; or who eats and drinks near or among the common people; or whose conduct with other people is not gentle and he does not receive them with a favorable countenance, but rather contests with them and vents his anger; and the like. Everything depends on the stature of the sage. [The extent to which] he must be careful with himself and go beyond the measure of the law [depends on the level of his Torah stature.]</p>\n  \n  <p>[The converse is] also [true]. When a sage is stringent with himself, speaks pleasantly with others, his social conduct is [attractive] to others, he receives them pleasantly, he is humbled by them and does not humble them in return, he honors them - even though they disrespect him - he does business faithfully, and does not frequently accept the hospitality of the common people or sit with them, and at all times is seen only studying Torah, wrapped in tzitzit, crowned with tefillin, and carrying out all his deeds beyond the measure of the law - provided he does not separate too far [from normal living] and thus become forlorn – to the extent that all praise him, love him, and find his deeds attractive - such a person sanctifies [God's] name.

But most of us can't be expected to reach their level.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>We are commanded to love Hashem with all our heart, all our soul and all our might. (First paragraph of the Shma.) Clearly, we need to serve Hashem with all parts of ourselves -- our bodies, our minds, and our emotions. </p>\n\n<p>It is not easy to change our emotions, just as it not easy to refrain from sins. But the ideal is that our head rules over our heart. We have to try.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say I keep getting angry although I know I should not get angry (\"Let my soul be silent to those who curse me...\" from the post-Amidah prayer). Orchot Tzaddikim says if I have an angry temperment, I should adopt the opposite mentality, never raising our voice and such even when it may be appropriate, until I have accustomed myself to avoiding anger. To be honest, I am trying to implement this in my own life!</p>\n\n<p>Another example: let's say you know it is a commandment to love Hashem (one of the six constant mitzvot.) Then take a few minutes to meditate on G-d's greatness, as recommended in Chabad chassidut, which says that this will lead to a fiery love of G-d. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, with forgiveness, this is not easy but it is not all or nothing, and with effort we can achieve at least partial forgiveness. See this essay on the Lubavitcher Rebbe's discussion of different levels of forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/593022/jewish/Must-I-Forgive-Everyone.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/593022/jewish/Must-I-Forgive-Everyone.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>If we have difficulty achieving these things, we have to keep trying, and as Rebbe Nachman explains, we should pray in our own words, because prayer always helps (see Likutei Eitzot, Hitbodedut, Tefilah). Both chassidic and mussar literature contains numerous suggestions on controlling our emotions and cultivating positive emotions such as love and fear of G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

Come, my people, enter your chambers and shut your doors around you.

Once they are alive they also know their creator and will turn from their zombie ways, as we know from the fact that Ezekiel lived to tell the tale for 11 more chapters.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when the zombie apocalypse comes, you have two choices: (a) smite them, as they are not living people, or (b) read to them from this book and they will turn to your side.</p>\n\n\n",

Does an elevated platform have that status? What size? How about a stage - or a Bimah, for that matter? Is a car floor a floor? A bus, train, or airplane?

He does indeed use the words 'al haaretz'. (Seemingly the only difference between sefer torah or tefillin in this law is that one fasts for a sefer torah falling even if it was in its wrapping/container.) The Mishna Berura cites the Magen Avraham (40, 3.)</p>\n\n<p>Piskei Teshuvot (vol 1 p.359) refers to Shut Afarkasta De'aniya that who says that this only applies if the tefillin fell onto the actual ground, however, if they fell onto a vessel that was on the ground one would not have to fast.</p>\n\n<p>The Kaf Hachayim (40, 7) based upon the Ben Ish Chai does not rule that they have to fall onto the ground. If they fall more than three tefachim it is a denigration of the tefillin and one should fast/give charity. It is not important what they fell onto but rather that they fell from his hand.</p>\n\n<p>According to the first opinion it is clear that something like a bimah is not considered part of the floor. At the very least it would be a vessel upon the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, there is a law of lavud, i.e. anything within 3 tefachim of the ground is considered part of the ground. For example, the Shulchan Aruch discusses this regarding praying on a raised area above 3 tefachim (90, 1). However, if the raised area is 4 x 4 amos wide it has a status as a separate floor (90, 2). The cases you mentioned of cars, trains and planes the floor would usually have the dimensions to be considered a floor in these regards.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't believe that there's a 'one size fits all' answer to the more general question of how we define a floor in halakha, but we may be able to extrapolate a few principles. </p>\n\n<p>We can import a halakha from the laws of shabbos (and sukka): levud. This means that anything withing 3 tefachim is considered attached. If a step etc. is raised slightly off the ground, but less than 3 tefachim, then it is not raised enough to be considered something other than floor.  </p>\n\n<p>One of the only cases where the Shulchan Aruch gives some parameters for what's considered a floor is in the laws of prayer. He writes in O.C 90:2 that a person may not daven on a raised platform, but if this platform is 4 by 4 amos, then it is permissible. One reason  is because a person davening on such a platform won't fall off, but another reason (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43059&st=&pgnum=95&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beis Yosef</a> in the name of Mahari Abuhav) is because an area that is 4x4 amos is considered a 'reshus bifnei atzmo', it's own domain (also from Gemara Shabbos, see daf 5a). This reasoning sounds like it would be applicable anywhere else we need to define a floor: something that is 4x4 amos is its own floor, even if it's a raised platform. </p>\n\n<p>However, I'd imagine that another requirement to be a floor is that it's actually used as a floor. A table can also be 4x4 amos but is not a floor because nobody uses it as such. Especially for a halakha (not necessarily this one, just hypothetically) which depends on the disrespect that is conveyed by a floor, I'd imagine that only a platform that is made to be used primarily for being stepped on fits the bill. </p>\n\n\n",

We see Achashverosh held like this opinion, as it says (Esther 1:7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיֵין מַלְכוּת רָב בְּיַד הַמֶּלֶךְ<br>\n  And the rabbi's wine in the hand of the king.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did Achashverosh only have one hand? Rather he held of this Rashba.</p>\n\n<p>We see Rabba Vashti held this way as well from her name, which properly pronounced is: Washti, a contraction of Wash and Tea. However, while Washti was strict on herself, she was lenient to others, as it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹא-עָשְׂתָה, אֶת-מַאֲמַר הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ, בְּיַד הַסָּרִיסִים<br>\n  She didn't follow King Achashverosh's opinion to the hand of the servants</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence she was killed as a Moredet beMalchut.</p>\n\n<p>2) Esther was a rabba too, as were all the women Achashverosh collected, as it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּבְהִקָּבֵץ נְעָרוֹת רַבּוֹת אֶל-שׁוּשַׁן הַבִּירָה, אֶל-יַד הֵגָי; וַתִּלָּקַח אֶסְתֵּר אֶל-בֵּית הַמֶּלֶךְ, אֶל-יַד הֵגַי<br>\n  And when maiden rabbot were gathered in Shushan the capital in the care of Hagai, Esther was taken to the kings house to the care of Hagai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabba Esther, who was also a prophetess, certainly was careful about this Halacha. The Torah hints to this in Deut 25:11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וקרבה אשת האחד להציל את אישה מיד מכהו ושלחה ידה<br>\n  And the wife of the man (Esther) will come forth to save her husband (Mordochai) from the hand of his oppressor (Haman), and she will send forth her hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Esther was using only one hand to get at Haman at the wine party, it must be because she had washed her other one and didn't want it to touch something impure. (Incidentally, that verse also implies Haman also washed one hand, but that clearly was just to fit in with the king.

However, since I'm now preparing for Purim, I would be happy to hear of a proper, sensitive approach to teaching the story. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When I was telling the story to my son when he was younger (he's still pretty young, so <em>even younger</em>), I used the following euphemisms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>King Ahashverosh wanted to show everyone how pretty Vashti was, but she didn't want everyone looking at her so she said no, and he got angry and sent her away.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bigthan and Teresh wanted to hurt the king, and when Mordechai heard them talking about it he told Esther ... and they got punished.</p></li>\n<li><p>Haman wanted to get rid of all the Jews.</p></li>\n<li><p>Haman got mad at Mordechai for not bowing down to him.</p></li>\n<li><p>Esther told the king that Haman wanted to get rid of her and her people, and the King punished him.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(I may have also mentioned the hanging. I can't remember for sure, but I remember thinking about the fact that, as far as a child that small knows, hanging from a tree sounds like an awfully uncomfortable and possibly embarrassing experience, but there's not necessarily an assumption that it is fatal.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm assuming this question is based on the assumption that you don't want to have to explain murder to your child by exposing him to such violent imagery, rather than a question about how to do exactly that. (One does not have to venture too far into the Torah to find murder, so the time to explain these things comes quite soon. Most schools I'm familiar with don't even bother to put these things in context; they just present the text as is. And the children are certainly younger than bar-mitzva-age. But let's not get into a parenting discussion here about the proper age at which to teach children about these things.)</p>\n\n<p>Although the story of Purim revolves around murder and violence, the spirit of the story is not lost if you replace any element of murder with some other form of less-violent unpleasantness, such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wvrbAa2Onk\" rel=\"nofollow\">being banished</a> (perhaps to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSpudzk3y2E\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Island of Perpetual Tickling\"!</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how old your child is, but if s/he is even somewhat resourceful, and there is access to a Megillas Esther with English translation (which are usually quite accessible in the average American <em>shul</em>), perhaps better not to pretend that the story does not contain violent elements.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The problem with touching up the story is that children are sometimes left with these misconceptions, which my lead to embarrassment upon this realization besides for ignorance.  I remember at one point in my schooling the rebbi telling the class that they actually killed vashti and that he had realized that many students were unaware if this due to  teachers covering it up.\nPerhaps preferable would be to simple mention the plot points that are age appropriate; e.g. mention Ester becoming queen without mentioning Vashti's fate. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"Blias\" in today's pots and pans\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Throughout all of Yoreh Deah Chelek Alef and Hilchos Pesach (and perhaps other places in Shulchan Aruch as well) we see the idea of \"blias\" (\"absorptions\") by celim. That is to say there is a \"taste\" that is left in a pot or pan after cooking in it. Therefore if someone would cook meat in a pot, then within the same day cook milk in it (even though there is no meat in the pot now), still there is a \"taste\" of meat that was left inside of the pot walls when it was first cooked. That taste will now come out of the pot when cooking milk in it and will prohibit the milk.</p>\n\n<p>This is all true of a metal pot. However, a glass pot, according to the Machaber, doesn't take in any taste at all. On the other side of things, if one has a pot made of \"cheres\" (earthenware), he would never be able to expunge taste from it once it was cooked in (not like a metal pot which one could kasher by making ha'galeh on it).</p>\n\n<p>I'm having a difficult time understanding how this din (rule) is still relevant to today's pots. Is there <em>really</em> a taste left inside of a metal pot? Once upon a time a metal pot that was cooked in over time would slowly become dirty, grimy, filthy, covered in black, clearly used. One could look at this and understand that there is a \"taste\" left in the walls of the pot. However, I don't see how this is true of a normal metal pot in today's market, which is smooth, finished off, and more or less retains it's original color and look and stays clean over time. Where is the \"taste\" in the walls of this pot? If someone would cook milk or meat in it and then cook water in it, would the water have any taste to it (assuming the pot was cleaned in between)? While I don't see any posek (halachic decisor) using this argument even as a \"tziruf\" (argument in combination with other leniencies) to be lenient in a question of issur v'heter (forbidden combinations), still, I'm looking for any poskim that perhaps spoke about this or entertained the possibility. Maybe today's \"metal\" pots are more like a glass pot, which the poskim say doesn't retain any taste of what's cooked in it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>From a Kosher Spirit <a href=\"http://www.kosherspirit.com/Article.asp?Issue=14&Article=181\">interview with Rabbi Chaim Cohn</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>KS: Can you share a unique experience that you had while working at\n  the OK? </p>\n  \n  <p>RCC: I once had an argument with a plant engineer concerning\n  whether or not stainless steel can absorb or not. He maintained and\n  brought extensive documentation to prove that stainless steel can’t\n  absorb anything and therefore should not need kosherization. I told\n  him, your proofs are impressive but the Rabbis decreed 2000 years ago\n  that metal needs kosherization and I do not have the authority to go\n  against them. We agreed to differ.</p>\n  \n  <p>Approximately a year later, I was in the process of supervising the\n  kosherization of a 1000 gallon reactor and after the workers had\n  meticulously cleaned it we brought it to a boil. There was about a\n  quarter of an inch of scum on the top of the pot. The engineer was\n  passing by and I called him over to look at it. I said, “This was a\n  completely clean pot.” I turned to the workers and asked, “Right?” The\n  workers nodded their heads vigorously up and down. The engineer looked\n  at it and said, “ I can’t argue with empirical evidence,” and walked\n  away.</p>\n  \n  <p>Six months later I got a call from the engineer. He said, “Rabbi Cohn,\n  I now understand.” “Great,” I thought, and asked, “You now understand\n  what?” He answered, “I understand why a stainless steel vessel will\n  absorb.” I asked, “Why?” He answered, “You have to understand, when it\n  leaves the factory it can’t absorb anything, however, when it is\n  heated it expands and contracts and it will produce micro fissures.\n  Your Rabbis were right, you can’t measure this and therefore have to\n  assume the worst-case scenario that the entire volume has absorptions\n  in it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba made a ruling \"in principle\" saying that modern stainless steel cookware does not absorb flavor at a halachiclly significant level.  </p>\n\n<p>Apparently two Avrachim from the Torat HaChaim yeshiva tested the amount of absorption of stainless steel and found it to be one part in 170,000 of the volume of the fluid cooked in the pot.  In response to this test Rav Lior wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"זוהי בליעה מזערית ביותר, ולכן נראה בפשטות שכלי נירוסטה הוא ככלי\n  זכוכית\"</p>\n  \n  <p>This is an extremely insignificant amount of absorption, and thus it\n  seems plainly that stainless steel pots are like glass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Further, a letter was later published in the Makor Rishon newspaper in which he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"בשעתו אמרתי שאם יתברר בוודאות שיש חומר כלשהו שאינו בולע, דינו יהיה\n  ככלי זכוכית, שלדעת ה'שולחן ערוך' אינו בולע ולכן אינו טעון הגעלה לפסח\n  ודי בשטיפה\"</p>\n  \n  <p>At the time I said that if it will become certain that there is any\n  substance that does not absorb, his law will be like the law of glass,\n  that according to the Shulchan Aruch does not absorb and thus does not\n  require \"hagala\" for Pesach and it is sufficient to wash it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Lior concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אף לדעת הרמ\"א, המחמיר בכלי זכוכית, הדברים אמורים דווקא בכלי זכוכית\n  שתחילת יצירתם מחול ולכם דינם כחרס. אולם כלי נירוסטה, שאינם בולעים כמעט\n  כלום ונעשו ממתכת ולא מחול, מותר לבשל בהם בשר, לנקות היטב ואחר כך לבשל\n  חלב באותו היום, והן להפך\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Even according to the opinion of the Rama, who is stringent with glass\n  utensils, saying that since they are initially made from sand their\n  ruling is like earthenware.  But stainless steel utensils, that don't\n  hardly absorb anything and are made of metal not sand, it is\n  permissible to cook in them meat, to clean well and after to cook milk\n  the same day, and the reverse as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his letter to the two avrechim he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"מכיוון שדין זה עלול להתפרש כדבר חדש, בקשתי היא שיסכימו איתי עוד שני\n  פוסקים ויצטרפו להיתר זה\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Since this ruling might be interpreted as something new, I request\n  that two other poskim will agree with me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://net-sah.org/he/node/6507\" rel=\"noreferrer\">All this according to Rav Ratzon Arusi</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://youtu.be/oGTjDeeIevo?t=40s\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a video in which Rav Bar Chaim</a> from Machon Shilo discusses his support of Rav Lior's ruling and his belief that it would also apply to forbidden substances.  He mentions the above reported by Rav Arusi and also discusses a conversation with a Rav Dr. Moshe Antelman a PhD chemist who worked in industrial chemical engineering who joked with him that the absorption was, \"approximately three atoms\".  In seriousness he said it was clear to him that there is no halachiclly significant absorption.  </p>\n\n<p>Rav Bar Chaim goes on to point discuss the 1/60th rule and how there was a machloket whether or not it applied only to earthenware pots or if it also applied to metal pots.  He brings Rambam <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5217.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">הלכות מאכלות אסורות יז</a> to support that this is only regarding earthenware and points out that Ra'avad agrees with Rambam in this case as does the Rashbah and the Ran and list the sources.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קדירה של חרס שנתבשל בה בשר נבילה, או בשר שקצים ורמשים--לא יבשל בה בשר\n  שחוטה באותו היום.  ואם בישל בה מין בשר, התבשיל אסור; בישל בה מין אחר,\n  בנותן טעם.  [ב] ולא אסרה תורה אלא קדירה בת יומה בלבד, הואיל ועדיין לא\n  נפגם השומן שנבלע בקדירה; ומדברי סופרים, לא יבשל בה לעולם.  לפיכך אין\n  לוקחין כלי חרס ישנים מן הגויים שנשתמשו בהן בחמין, כגון קדירות וקערות,\n  לעולם, ואפילו היו שוועין באבר; ואם לקח, ובישל בהן מיום שני\n  והלאה--התבשיל מותר.</p>\n  \n  <p>A pot of earthenware in which the meat of a nevilah ( non-kosher meat ) was cooked, or the\n  meat of bugs or insects -- don't cook in it kosher meat on the same\n  day.  And if he cooked the same type of meat in it, the cooked dish is\n  forbidden; if he cooked a different type of meat then it is according\n  to if it improved the flavor.  And the Torah only forbid a pot on the\n  same day, because the fat that has been absorbed in the [ earthenware\n  ] pot has not yet gone bad; and our Sages forbid cooking in this pot\n  forever.  Thus, we do not take old earthenware pots from gentiles who\n  have cooked hot in them, such as pots and bowls, ever, and even if it\n  was [ something I can't translate ];  and if one took, and cooked in\n  it from the second day on -- the cooked food is permissible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He points out that the majority of Rishonim agree with the statement from Avot that glass does not absorb and that he agrees with Rav Lior's statement that stainless steel is like glass and that regular cleaning with soap is sufficient, i.e. that hagalah is not required. He further points out that according to his opinion washing with soap causes any matter that might remain on the surface of the pot to become \"pagum\", no longer considered food. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A side note of interest is that <em>according Rambam's method</em>, in specific cases where transfer of flavor is the criteria used ( and it's not used in all cases ) then it only applies if there is a trusted gentile physically present to taste the food for you and tell you if flavor has been transferred.  Otherwise, transfer of taste is not applicable and you go by the 1/60 rule ( or 1/100 or 1/200 depending on the particular substance involved ).  Another thing to point out is that transfer of flavor doesn't apply if the flavor transferred is a unpleasant or bad flavor.  For example if a mouse where to be found in a barrel of wine it wouldn't make if forbidden because it doesn't improve the flavor of the wine.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a list of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel#Properties\" rel=\"noreferrer\">properties of stainless steel on wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A kashrus inspector told me the following \"Very little, if any, perceptible ta'am exists in modern equipment.  For most production, even a minimal washing (not heat sensitive) is considered adequate.\nEquipment used for flavor and flavor chemical production will sometimes be steam cleaned for days to ensure no residue of the prior flavor.  Also, only glass is considered to be 100% impenetrable, metal are considered to allow some penetration through them.\"</p>\n\n<p>I heard in the name of an unnamed great rabbi that when Moshiach comes, he is going to make some big changes in halachos like this. The halacha assumes the entire volume of the pot's walls and base are full of absorbed taste and therefore the volume of food inside the pot can never have 60 times the volume of absorbed taste in the walls. That was never possible even with the oldest pots and even more unrealistic today but I have never heard of a posek using any of your observations to be lenient.</p>\n\n\n",

Cutting peyos off with a scissor that provides a cut as short as a razor is completely acceptable. (The Darchei Teshuva (181:2) writes, based on the Sefer Hachinuch, that one is merely exempt from punishment, but even the Rambam understands using a razor to be prohibited. However, this doesn't seem to be the simple reading of either the Rambam or Sefer Hachinuch). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Tosafos</strong> (Nazir 41b s.v. Hashta) and the <strong>Rosh</strong> (Makos 3:2-3) disagree with the Rambam and maintain that the prohibition to remove the peyos ha’rosh would apply equally to removal with a razor and removal with any other cutting instrument. The Shulchan Aruch (Y. D. 181:3) rules like the Rambam but suggests being strict like Tosfos. </p>\n\n<p>However, this only indirectly relates to the question of length, because these poskim might still not require a minimum length.  Thus, later poskim have looked for clues throughout rabbinic literature for the definition of a significant piece of hair:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Rambam (Nezirus 5:11) writes that a nazir is only held accountable for cutting hair in a way that he removes it entirely. If he trims his hair and leaves the length that would allow the top of the hair to be bent back toward it’s root he is said to have left hair and is therefore not punished for shaving his hair. Dayan Yitzchak Weiss (Minchas Yitzchak IV:113:5) applies this same criteria to the length of hairs in the peyos. Rav Yisroel Belsky suggests that when one uses a number two extension on a trimmer he has left a substantial enough length of hair.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Rambam (Hilchos Parah Adumah 1:4) rules that a completely red cow that has two white or black hairs would not have the status of a Parah Adumah.

Afilu) writes that one cannot cut his peyos to the point that they are “literally close to the skin” but can leave “very very little”. While the Biur Halacha does not quantify what is considered “very very little” one may suggest that the intention is for even the shortest hairs so long as their presence is easily felt. (See Perisha 181 who also implies that very short hairs are acceptable).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Is it even allowed for them to Join the Muslim congregation and pray the Salat for they worship the same God (According to Maimonides)?</p>\n<p>Some references, from <a href=\"http://www.hashlamah.org/co-worship.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.hashlamah.org/co-worship.html</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Muslim historian, Ibn al-Qifti (1172-1248) reports nothing less than\nthat the Rambam himself, on numerous occasions, voluntarily went to\nmosques to pray [1], under no compulsion and seeing no contradiction\nwith his Judaism. Ibn al-Qifti notes that this was towards the end of\nMaimonides’ life and was not an event of his youth, under fear of the\nAl-Mohades who had invaded Al-Andalus in his youth.[1]\nKenneth Seeskin writes, in The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides, “although Ibn\nal-Qifti’s book has come down to us in a later recension, and contains\nsome errors, we have no reason to doubt the information on\nMaimonides.”[2]</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef witnessed prominent rabbis who prayed in the Mosque at the Cave of Machpelah. He then determines decisively that in Mosques it is permitted to <strong>pray and learn</strong> there. [3]</p>\n<p>[1] Tarikh al-Hukama, p. 318, trans. Kraemer in Fine, 2001. 424.<br />\n[2] Kenneth Seeskin, The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides, (Cambridge  University Press: 2005)</p>\n<p>[3] Responsa Yabiah Omer 7, Yoreh De'ah 12, paragraph 4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>As Dov F has noted, the argument over praying in a mosque is now split between R. Ovadia Yosef and the Tzitz Eliezer. Please see the update below regarding the original Rambam responsa that is referred to by R. Ovadia.</p>\n<p>The Tzitz Eliezer writes against praying in a mosque in his responsa Volume 14, #91:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולמדנו מכאן שהקדשים של כותים וגם המשוגע של הישמעאלים אע\"פ שאין טועין אחריהם לעשותן אלהות, הואיל ומשתחוים לפניהם השתחואה של אלהות דין ע\"א יש להן לכל דבר איסור של ע\"א...</p>\n<p>הרי למדנו מפורש מדברי הר\"ן דגם לעבודת הישמעאלים והשתחויתם לנביא השקר שלהם דין ע\"א יש לקדשיהם לכל דבר, וא\"כ ברור לפי\"ז שגם בית המסגד שלהם שבו הם מבצעים עבודתם יש לו ג\"כ דין של בית ע\"א לכל דבר ואסור ליכנס לשם, וברוך אלקינו שהבדילנו מן התועים ונתן לנו תורת אמת. בברכה ובהוקרה אליעזר יהודא וולדינברג.</p>\n<p>We learn [from the Ran] that the sanctuaries of Samaritans and Muslims, even though they don't err in creating a deity, since they bow down and prostrate they have the status of idolatry in all matters...</p>\n<p>We have learned from the Ran that even the worship of Muslims and their prostration to their false prophet has the status of idolatry for all matters, and thus it is clear that their mosque where they perform this worship has a status of a house of idolatry for all matters and it is forbidden to enter into there. And blessed is our God who separated us from those who stray and gave us a true Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, according to R. Ovadia a Jew is allowed to pray in a mosque. He cites many authorities who allow this, but his main source to rely on is the Rambam [Maimonides].</p>\n<p>He writes in the end of his responsa Yabia Omer Volume 7 Yoreh Deah #12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומעתה נראה שהמסגדים של הערבים אין להם דין בתי עבודה זרה, ומותר להכנס בתוכם.   ואפילו הר\"ן שאמר שהואיל ומשתחוים לפניהם כעבודה של אלהות דין ע\"ז יש להם, י\"ל שאילו הוה שמיע ליה כל מ\"ש הרמב\"ם בתשובה לא היה אומר כן.   שבודאי הרמב\"ם היה בקי בהם ביותר.   ... וא\"כ הוא הדין שמותר להתפלל במסגד של הערבים...  וא\"כ גם במסגד של ערבים שאין שם ע\"ז, ותפלתם להשי\"ת ביחוד שאין בו דופי, אין שום איסור להתפלל שם, וכן ראיתי לכמה גאונים וצדיקים שהיו מתפללים בתוך המסגד של מערת המכפלה, ועד עכשיו יש שם בהכ\"נ קבוע לתפלה, לאחינו תושבי חברון וקרית ארבע.   ואמנם בשו\"ת ציץ אליעזר חלק י\"ד (ס\"ס צא) כתב להשוות דין המסגד של ערבים לכניסיה של נוצרים, ע\"פ דברי הר\"ן סנהדרין (סא ב).   ובמחכ\"ת עמו הסליחה.   שאנו תופסים עיקר כדברי הרמב\"ם שהישמעאלים לאו עובדי ע\"ז נינהו, וממילא אין למסגדיהם דין בית ע\"ז. ... ומ\"ש התוס' מגילה (ו א) ד\"ה טרטיאות, שקשה לומר שבאותם מקומות יכולים ללמוד שם, זהו רק בבתי ע\"ז, אבל במסגדים של ישמעאלים שאין שם ע\"ז כלל אף התוס' מודים שמותר להתפלל וללמוד שם</p>\n<p>And thus it appears that the Arab mosques do not have the status of houses of idolatry, and it is permitted to enter into them. And even though the Ran said that their prostrating is a kind of worship to a deity that grants their worship idolatrous, it can also be said that had he [the Ran] heard what the Rambam wrote in his responsa he wouldn't have said what he did, since the Rambam was obviously the more erudite between the two of them...[R.Ovadia then lists other authorities who are lenient on the matter] ...</p>\n<p>And thus it is also permitted to pray in an Arab mosque... And so, in an Arab mosque, where there is no idolatry, and their prayers are to God with an untainted monotheistic belief, there is no prohibition to pray there. And I also saw many great rabbis and righteous individuals who would pray in the cave of Machpelah [which is also a mosque]. And even now there is a fixed synagogue to pray for our brothers living in Hevron and Kiryat Arba.</p>\n<p><strong>This is even though the Tzitz Eliezer wrote equating the law of an Arab mosque with a Christian church</strong>, in the way of the Ran. May his honorable Torah forgive us, but we regard the main point in the words of the Rambam - that Ishmaelites are not idolators - and so their moques are not idolatrous...And even the Tosafot, who argued against learning in an idolatrous house of worship, would acknowledge that Arab mosques are not at all idolatrous and a Jew can pray and learn there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice that R. Ovadia does not mention praying alongside Muslims during their Salat, and so it is not clear what he thinks about that situation (although I suspect there would be an issue of <em>maarit ayin</em> - where one may misinterpret such actions to believe that Muslim prayer is the same as Jewish prayer). Nevertheless, this is the main responsa today that allows for a Jew to enter and pray in a mosque.</p>\n<p>-- UPDATE --</p>\n<p>For the sake of clarity, I'll provide the source from Rambam. It's brought down by the Chida in his book Maarit Ayin (Likutim, #8, page 79A), who records the responsa:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סימן ח' ש\"ע י\"ר סי' דין ז' ישמעאלים וכו' בברכי יוסף רמזתי תשובת הרמב\"ם ז\"ל כ\"י ובשיורי ברכה י\"ד ק\"א סי' קכ\"ג שם כתבתי יותר ותשובת הרמב\"ם ז\"ל כ\"י שהבאתי שם אין עמדי. אך ראיתי באגרות הרמב\"ם הנדפסות דף מ\"ד מדפוס אמשטרדם תשובת הרמב\"ם ז\"ל לגר צדק דקרי בחיל דהגם דמקדם היו עובדים ג' ע\"ז זה היה קודם דת הישמעאלים אך עתה בכל זה מכונים לשמים וענין ע\"ז נכרת מפיהם והם ונשיהם וטפם אין להם טעות ביחוד ע\"ש באורך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A same responsa from Rambam can be found in English in <em>A Maimonides Reader</em> ed. Isadore Twersky, \"Letter to an Inquirer\" (477). It records the second half of the responsa:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...When your teacher called you a fool for denying that Muslims are idolaters he sinned grievously, and it is fitting that he ask your pardon, though he be your master. Then let him fast and weep and pray; perhaps he will find forgiveness. Was he intoxicated that he forgot the thirty-three passages in which the Law admonishes concerning \"strangers\"? For even if he had been in the right and you in error, it was his duty to be gentle; how much more, when the truth is with you and he was in error!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The source is found in <em>Teshuvot HaRambam</em> #448. The halacha of Muslims not being idolators is codified in Rambam's Mishneh Torah, Maachalot Asurot, Ch. 11, Halacha 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן כל עכו\"ם שאינו עובד עכו\"ם כגון אלו הישמעאלים יינן אסור בשתייה ומותר בהנייה וכן הורו כל הגאונים, אבל אותם העובדים עכו\"ם סתם יינם אסור בהנייה</p>\n<p>And with regard to any gentile that doesn't worship false deities, such as the Ishmaelim [Arabs], it is forbidden to drink his wine. It is, however, permitted to benefit from it. The Geonim rule in this way. However, regarding those who worship false deities, it is forbidden to benefit from their ordinary wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Salat <a href=\"http://www.sunniforum.com/forum/showthread.php?38303-The-translation-of-salat-%28namaz%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">includes</a> the line \"And I bear witness that Muhammad is [Allah's] servant and Messenger\" which contradicts Jewish belief. You would not be allowed to say this line, and I think you would not be allowed to participate in the Salat in a manner that makes people think you are saying this line.</p>\n\n<p>I sort of think that if there were a Muslim prayer that happened to be perfectly compatible with Jewish theology, you would be OK saying this prayer with a Muslim congregation. But that's just a guess.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>RaMbaM himself prostrated ( <a href=\"http://www.chayas.com/qidah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chayas.com/qidah.htm</a> ), and his son Rabbeinu Avarohom said that the islamic prostration comes from our prophets. He also said we should be ashamed that the goyim are taking our minhagim while we are taking the bad minhagim of the goyim(Hamaspik LaOvdei HaShem). </p>\n\n<p>I also found this from a blog that is promoting the site that OP has posted: \"The Ishmaelites are not at all idolaters; [idolatry] has long been severed from their mouths and hearts; and they attribute to God a proper unity, a unity concerning which there is no doubt. And because they lie about us, and falsely attribute to us the statement that God has a son, there is [nevertheless] no reason for us to lie about them and say that they are idolaters... And should anyone say that the house that they honor [the Ka‘abah] is a house of idolatry and an idol is hidden within it, which their ancestors used to worship, then what of it? The hearts of those who prostrate toward it today are [directed] only toward Heaven . . . [Regarding] the Ishmaelites today - idolatry has been severed from the mouths of all of them [including] women and children. Their error and foolishness is in other things which cannot be put into writing because of the renegades and wicked among Israel [koferim/apostates].

I think its on page 403 or earlier. I read a little but I don't have time to read through all of that. I assume he is quoting correctly, if not please correct him. </p>\n\n<p>But regarding joining muslims in prayer is not something RaMbaM would agree with. For he says they are apikorsim, that is the reason we are not allowed to teach them Torah. However, christians who are ovdei avodoh zoroh are allowed to be though the holochoth of banei NoahH, for they don't hold that the Torah was changed. </p>\n\n\n",

This\n  destruction obliges us to allow our longing for the far away land to\n  express itself only in mourning, in wishing and hoping; and only\n  through the honest fulfillment of all Jewish duties to await the\n  realization of this hope. <strong>But it forbids</strong> us to strive for the\n  reunion or possession of the land by any but spiritual means.\" (Horeb,\n  1981: p.461)</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Sages say G-d imposed three vows when he sent Israel into the\n  wilderness: </p>\n  \n  <p>(1) that the children of Israel shall never seek to reestablish their\n  nation by themselves; </p>\n  \n  <p>(2) that they never be disloyal to the nations which have given them\n  shelter; </p>\n  \n  <p>(3) that these nations shall not oppress them excessively </p>\n  \n  <p>(Kesubos 111a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are there any biblical evidences from Tanach or <strong>those who believe in Oral Torah</strong> for such views? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are no explicit biblical proofs for this. However, there is a fairly famous statement in the גמרא in .כתובות קיא: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יוסי ברבי חנינא דאמר ג' שבועות הללו למה אחת שלא יעלו ישראל בחומה ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את ישראל שלא ימרדו באומות העולם ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את העובדי כוכבים שלא ישתעבדו בהן בישראל יותר מדאי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This דרשא from a פסוק in שיר השירים says that Jews cannot \"raise in a wall\", i.e. in military strength, was taken by many including Rav S.R. Hirsch to mean that it is אסור for Jews to re-establish a Jewish government.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to realize is that these above mentioned Rabbonim were mainly protesting non-religious Zionism, because it basically did away with Torah. It is true that they protested religious zionism, but mainly because they associated themselves with the non-religious zionists.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>BS\"D</p>\n\n<p>I have remark.....</p>\n\n<p>suppose that the points mentioned by the Maharal and Rabbi Hirsh are right that we, because of the 3 oaths were not allowed to Establish a Jewish state.\nג' שבועות הללו למה אחת שלא יעלו ישראל בחומה ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את ישראל שלא ימרדו באומות העולם ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את אומות העולם שלא ישתעבדו בהן בישראל יותר מדאי.</p>\n\n<p>But the same oath included that the Goyim would \n-not deal with us harshly \n-would give us at a certain point permission to return to our homeland.\nAnd what happened in the last 150 years is very important to start understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly a, unfortunately non-orthodox, stream of Jews longing for the return to Zion started due to the harsh prosecutions of Jews in France and eastern Europe. This is actually a transgression by the Goyim to their promise not to deal with us Harshly.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Herzl wrote is \"alt-neu-land\" based on these events in France and eastern Europe and it was this what aroused a general feeling. But it was in no way an uprising against the non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly: The Balfour declaration that was written in 1917 spoke about the legal return of the Jews to Israel and restoring the Jewish home-land.</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly: The \"League of Nations\" (the UN of those days) decided in 1920 in San Remo (Italy) to grant the Jews the right to return and establish a state, decided upon its borders, etc. \nAnd this San Remo Conference treaty is still valid and was ratified by the UN when the UN was erected !!!</p>\n\n<p>Fifthly: 13 years after the San Remo conference  (the Bar Mitsva) in 1933 the Nazi-party in Italy rose to power; The first warning.\nDuring these 7 years G'd warned the Jews to leave by ll kinds of anti-Jewish laws, discrimination, etc..|</p>\n\n<p>Sixth: 20 years after the San Remo Conference (when the treaty was legally 20 years old and according to Halacha Liable for punishment), the Shoa started.\nThe Jews that had listened survived and the others largely perished.</p>\n\n<p>And if there was not enough previous evidence that the Goyim dealt harshly with us Jews, the Shoa was the final sign that the famous Midrash, and the treaty we had with the Goyim, was invalidated by the Goyim themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore the right of us Jews to return to the land of Israel and establish a government was legal from a Thora and Midrash perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately a large part of the first Zionist were not religious, but that should not matter as G'd decides Himself who he will use for certain tasks.</p>\n\n<p>And my opinion is that the Chareidi group of Neturei Karta that follows the opinion of Joel Teitelbaum, was too secluded in their own world that they missed the important events like Balfour and the international legally binding laws of the San Remo conference. \nIF they had known about this legislation they wouldn't have joined the enemies of our people and causing many Jews to be killed due to their support of these enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Shir HaShirim mentions in chapter 5 that the \"Shomrim haSovvemim ba-Yr\" and how they hurt her.\nמצאוני השומרים הסובבים בעיר, הכוני פצעוני</p>\n\n<p>And the Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Shomrei haYir is \"Nuturei Karta\".\nAnd the girl is the allegorical description of the Jewish people longing and searching for G'd.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully someone will start teaching these Nuturei Karta people what damage they are doing and that they are hurting the girl instead of helping her find her husband.</p>\n\n\n",

There is a Shul that I Daven in that has a Kiddush every Shabbos Mevarchim. The reason they have it only every 4-5 weeks is due to the expense of supplying it weekly. They do it once a month in order to have time for people to Shmuz one with another and to stay connected with each other.

What follows is a rough translation in line with the commentaries.</p>\n\n<p>First, though, note that the structure was divided into two rooms, an inner room (which we usually call the <em>kodesh kadashim</em>) and an outer one (the <em>kodesh</em>). The two rooms were separated by a partition called, in this chapter, the <em>d'vir</em>. The inner room was 'inner' only in the sense that you went through the outer room to get to it: in fact, they were parallel to one another, each occupying the full width of the structure, the outer room first and the inner room second as in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aShotgun_house_plan.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">shotgun house</a>. The inner room was twenty cubits deep from front to back.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[After building the actual structure, which was stone,]<br>\n  <sup>15</sup> he built the walls inside of <em>erez</em>-wood planks: from floor to ceiling he coated [the stone walls] with wood inside. And he coated the [stone] floor with <em>b'rosh</em>-wood planks.<br>\n  <sup>16</sup> The end of the structure, the last twenty cubits, he built with <em>erez</em>-wood planks from floor to ceiling.…<br>\n  <sup>18</sup> The <em>erez</em> wood inside the structure was decorated with [shapes]. All was <em>erez</em> wood: no stone was visible.…<br>\n  <sup>20</sup> Beyond the <em>d'vir</em>… he coated with purified gold….<br>\n  <sup>21</sup> <em>Sh'lomo</em> coated the inside of the <em>kodesh</em> with purified gold.…<br>\n  <sup>22</sup> He coated the entire structure with gold, the entire structure [=even the ceiling].…<br>\n  <sup>29</sup> He decorated the [wooden planks covering the] walls of the structure with [shapes], both in the inner room and in the outer room.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What's with all the repetition?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Verses 15 and 16 could easily be combined to say he covered the walls of the whole structure (both rooms) with wooden planks.</li>\n<li>Likewise, verses 20 and 21 could be combined to say he gilded the walls of the whole structure (both rooms).</li>\n<li>More so, why does verse 22 repeat that he gilded the structure after verse 21 says so? Sure, the commentaries say verse 22 is singling out the ceiling. But why does it need to single out the ceiling instead of discussing it with the walls?</li>\n<li>Most of all, why does verse 29 repeat what verse 18 said already? Again, verse 18 is (seemingly) speaking of only the outer room whereas verse 29 speaks of both rooms, but (a) it's repeating verse 18 with respect to the outer room and (b) anyway, why discuss them separately? They can easily be combined into verse 29.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Strike chest in \"S'lach lanu\" on Shabas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose someone is praying <em>maariv</em>, <em>shacharis</em>, or <em>mincha</em> on <em>Shabas</em>, starts the weekday <em>amida</em>'s blessings, and then realizes, amid those weekday blessings, that he should be saying the <em>amida</em> of <em>Shabas</em>. As ruled in <em>Orach Chayim</em> 268:2, he should continue through to the end of whatever blessing he's amid, and then start the <em>Shabas</em> blessing. The reason he continues with the blessing he's amid, <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 2 writes, is that that blessing is really suitable for <em>Shabas</em> in theory.</p>\n\n<p>Now, during the third weekday-specific blessing (\"<em>S'lach lanu</em>\"), it's customary to strike one's chest with his fist. Suppose someone realizes, after starting that blessing but before reaching the part where he strikes his chest, that he should be saying the <em>amida</em> of <em>Shabas</em>. Then, per the preceding paragraph, he should finish \"<em>S'lach lanu</em>\". I wonder whether he should strike his chest. Arguably, yes, why not? On the other hand, though, (a) maybe, just as we don't (usually) say <em>viduy</em> on <em>Shabas</em>, there's some reason not to strike the chest on <em>Shabas</em>, and (b) maybe in order to save oneself the shame of revealing he started the weekday blessings, he can omit striking his chest. Does anyone have any sources on this, please?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>On Rosh Hashana, we recite Avinu Malekenu. However, some authorities maintain that one should omit the verse <em>chatanu l'fanecha</em> because it is like a <em>viduy</em>. The majority of the poskim hold that one may recite the verse as it is meant as a supplication, not a confession. However, <strong>they caution that one should not strike his chest as usual, lest it seem like a confession</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>(I'm basically quoting from the Artscroll R. H. Machzor, Nusach Ashkenaz, p. 553. I had a vague memory that they discussed such a thing and indeed found it there, but I don't have the time to find the real sources. Sorry.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For what it's worth, it seems that those who daven Mincha late on Erev Shabbos don't strike the chest when saying Slach Lanu.

He was referring to those who were wholeheartedly following God, to distinguish them from the children of Israel as a whole, just as you seek. (See the context in Exodus there.) So the term you seek is \"מִי לַה׳\", roughly \"whoever is God's\". But note that that phrase is not generally read as a substantive.</p>\n\n<p>Probably closer to what you're seeking is Deuteronomy 18:13. There, we have \"תָּמִים תִּהְיֶה עִם ה׳ אֱלֹקֶיךָ\". This is a difficult phrase to translate, and a difficult one to interpret. Interpretation first: Rashi and especially Nachmanides say it means that we should look only to God and that if astrologers or the like tell us what will happen we should nonetheless trust that God can do whatever he wishes. The key word here is \"תָּמִים\", which the JPS here translates as \"whole-hearted\" but which really means \"complete\": Onkelus here translates it into Aramaic as \"שַׁלְמִין\", from the root you seek. Rabbi Kaplan (<em>The Living Torah</em>) translates it as \"totally faithful\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Just by way of reference, and by no means is this the authority on the subject, Google Translate <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/#en/iw/submission\" rel=\"nofollow\">shows several Hebrew words for \"submission\"</a>, none of which has the root Sh-L-M.</p>\n\n<p>The closest I can think of to your desired translation are:<br>\nשולם/Shulam = paid (passive voice)<br>\nנשלם/Nishlam = completed; also paid (passive voice)</p>\n\n<p>The reason I say these examples are close is that they convey a sense of someone having fulfilled an obligation (although fulfilled is usually translated in the root M-L-A [where A is an Aleph], P-T-R, or Y-Tz-A, depending on the context).</p>\n\n\n",

He quotes and explains posukim in order to calm them down and to tell them that they can still perform misSwoth and are still jews. The community at the time were fluent in arabic and not so educated with regards to judaism or its language, due to persecution and what have you. Therefore Rabbi Maimon translated for them the prayer of havineinu, which is a shortened version of the standard shamonei asrei prayer, into arabic, for the people didn't have time to pray or learn. He also says that there will come a time when the oppressors will stop oppressing us and we can live a normal jewish life. From this we see that it is not ok to convert to islam because if it was ok, jews would have been converting long ago without oppression. Not only that RaMbaM calls muslims apikorsim for saying that the Torah was changed. Your statement above is wrong. The christians are ovdei avodoh zoroh, but not apikorsim, muslims are apikorsim but not ovdei avodoh zoroh. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>While you are correct that Islam is not heresy, that alone is not sufficient reason for a Jew to <em>convert</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are many things which are not accepted by Judaism but are not considered so damaging as to be branded <em>heresy</em>. For example, if I say I believe my rabbi is a prophet - that is a statement Judaism will roundly reject according to the mainstream opinion on what constitutes a prophet. But since there is nothing in the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_principles_of_faith#Maimonides.27_13_principles_of_faith\" rel=\"nofollow\">fundamentals</a></em> of Judaism that says my rabbi is not a prophet, my belief is simply a rejected notion but not <em>heresy</em>. Similarly, if I believe that roses are blue and violets are red, I am not a heretic, but of course I am still mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>The same Maimonides who said in his Iggeres HaShmad that one who converts to Islam is not a heretic, denied, in the same letter, that Muhammad was a prophet. He would also certainly deny, therefore, that the Quran is a revealed text. So while according to mainstream Jewish opinion Islam doesn't violate any of the fundamentals of Judaism which would render it heresy, it is still a mistaken belief system.</p>\n\n\n",

IF so, what? </p>\n\n<p>Based on the Tanakh, that says to \"Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy,\" would Jews translate something holy like \"Shabbat\" as merely \"seven\" or \"week,\" something  common?   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The only other way to translate would be \"remember the day of rest...\"  as Shabbat is the title for the day that hashem \"shavat\" rested. Though there are myriad understandings for what it means to rest, that is what the word and therefore the meaning of the name would be. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sabbath is the English rendering of Shabbat (or Shabbath or Shabbos - שבת), which etymologically stems from the root ש-ב-ת, which conveys cessation of activity. A related word in Hebrew is שֶבֶת, which means <em>sitting</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The word does not have any inherent numerical meaning (such as <em>seven</em>), but in rabbinic literature it is used to mean <em>week</em>.  The reason, though, is likely its cultural attachment to the seven-day cycle punctuated by the Sabbath at the end.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, to answer your question, though, we don't translate it as anything.  Most observant Jews actually don't even call it <em>Sabbath</em>.  We call it by its Hebrew name, and depending upon one's pronunciation, the most common pronunciations look in English like Shabbos or Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><code>Sabbath</code> has several meanings, <code>The day of Worship</code> and <code>The day of Rest</code>. Those days occur on the the 7th day of each week. Whereas, oneself should devote such a day for worshiping solely.</p>\n\n<p>In Arabic, <code>Saturday</code> / <code>Yom Sabbath</code> is <code>As-Sabbt</code> which means \"Rest\".</p>\n\n\n",

The Machaber brings an opinion that says to not say it; however, the Rema adds in that the minhag (custom) is like the first opinon to say it.</p>\n\n<p>(This halacha is true even in Yerushalayim (and any other place) where Purim is celebrated on the 15th. I'm pointing this out so one shouldn't think that Purim is superior to Channukah with respect to this halacha in that in the evening from the 14th to the 15th one could argue that there is more of a reason to say al hanissim even after the day ended as long as the seudah started by day.)</p>\n\n<p>My question is: is the same true by Channukah? If someone started a seudah on Zos Channukah (the last day of Channukah) and the seudah went into the night would the person also say al hanissim. The only difference I could think of is that by Purim there is an obligation to eat a meal. This is not the case by Channukah where the meal's not an obligation however under the right circumstances may be considered a mitzvah. Why this would be a difference for saying al hanissim or not after the day has ended I don't know: I'm just pointing out that this could be a possible difference that would affect the halacha. In any event, the Shulchan Aruch brings this point and <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/587\">makhlokes</a> only by Purim and not by Channukah. So again, is it the same <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/597\">halacha</a> by Channukah or perhaps over here there is no maklokes and everyone agrees that after the day has ended al hanissim shouldn't be said?</p>\n\n<p>I've looked around and haven't seen anyone that discusses this yet so I'm bringing the question here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=183\">Orach Chaim 188:10</a> says that one who starts a Seuda before the end of Chanuka and completes it after Chanuka would say Al HaNisim.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Juneau, Alaska -- surrounded by natural barriers -- a natural eruv\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently visited Juneau, Alaska.  It is a small city of 35,000.  The city limits are quite large, however – 3,225 square miles – but much of this area is separated from downtown Juneau on Douglas Island.  According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneau,_Alaska\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging 16 feet (5 m), below steep mountains about 3,500 feet (1,100 m) to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow.  Because the city is surrounded by ice or water, there are no roads in or out of town, and the only way to come or go is by air or sea.  Given this, could the glacier ice and the ocean be considered like mechitzas (walls) and enclose the city like an eruv?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It would depend on the exact dimentions of the barrriers. For Natural Topagraphy be considered a Mechitza, It would have to rise 10 tefachim in a span of 4 Amos. (mishna berura siman 363) (about 12% grade, if i remember my calculations correctly). To make a Mechitza for a whole town you would have to establish that there is a ring of natural mechitzos, following all the usual rules of connecting mechitzos and gaps in mechitzos</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hefsek between hagafen and drinking during havdallah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why does everybody (at least that I have ever seen), say \"borei pri hagefen\" first of all during havdallah, but not drink the wine until all of the other brachos have been said? Is saying the other brachos not a hefsek? How is the wine different from the spices, which I have always seen people smell immediately after making \"borei minei bsamim\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The reason being, that there are 2 types of <strong>Borei Pri Hagefen</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The first type is the classic one: You want to drink wine and you first have to make a Bracha. This is called ברכת הנהנין - a Bracha before enjoying something.</p>\n\n<p>The second type is the \"Shira\" type. The <em>Borei Pri Hagefen</em> is the Bracha we use in that case - we then say other Brachot - and then somebody drinks some wine, if possible. It's more of a ברכת המצוות - a bracha said on the Mitzva at hand.</p>\n\n<p>Examples are: Sheva Brachot, Brit Mila, Havdala and Kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>Sources: שערי נישואין by ר' יהודה טשזנר, Ofakim 2009.</p>\n\n<p>He's discussing whether the 7 Brachot can be said by 7 people, or whether you have to have the same person make the first 2 Brachot.</p>\n\n<p>He brings the שו\"ת להורות נתן in ח\"ד אה\"ע סי' ק\"ה: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וז\"ל: אין ראוי לחלק ברכת בורא פרי הגפן מברכת אירוסין או מברכת חתנים, דדווקא אם מברכים אותן ביחד יש מקום לומר דגם ברכת היין הוי בגדר ברכת המצוות משום דאין אומרים שירה אלא על היין, ונעשה גם ברכת היין כברכת המצוות ומוציא לאחרים ואף אם הוא לא ישתה, אבל כשמברך ברכת היין בלבד ואינו שותה ואינו אומר עליו שירה, איך יהיה ברכת היין כברכת המצוות, עכ\"ל. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In essence, if you only say <em>Borei Pri Hagefen</em> wihtout some type if Shira, then you'd have to drink some of the wine. If you also say the secnod Bracha (of the 7 Brachot) then the <em>Borei Pri Hagefen</em> is a ברכת המצוות.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, we see from here that there is a concept of <em>Borei Pri Hagefen</em> that belongs to the next Bracha to form a Mitzva (Kidush, Havdala, etc.) and drinking the wine is secondary and waits until after the Mitzva is done.</p>\n\n\n",

You can read the prophecies with translation right alongside to help with difficult words or phrases. The commentary is combination of Rashi and whatever other classic commentaries R' A. J. Rosenberg found useful (mostly Radak, Ibn Ezra, Joseph Kara, Abarbanel, Malbim). This is essentially an efficient and English-friendly way of learning Isaiah in the classical fashion, i.e. by poring over a <em>Mikraos Gedolos</em>.\nI found that it was helpful enough that I didn't get stuck wondering what prophecies were about or what Isaiah meant by something, but I didn't really come out with a clear picture of the organizational structure of Isaiah, nor a full appreciation of his style. At times it becomes confusing because of the several different understandings of the commentators that R' Rosenberg often tries to blend together, mixing and matching comments on various phrases.</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14369&st=&pgnum=3&hilite=\"><strong>Abarbanel on Isaiah</strong></a>. This was my personal choice, but could work just as well with another comprehensive commentary on Isaiah. Abarbanel in particular is attractive because he addresses pretty much every single issue that comes up exegetically, and he divides up the book into units (<em>nevuos</em>), each one introduced with its overall subject and purpose and relation to the previous unit. The pros: It was very helpful to have a single unified approach to the book, and a very organized one at that, and one that adheres strictly to <em>pshat</em> interpretation. The cons: Abarbanel in particular is quite prolix and verbose, and often gets caught on tangents. He often feels the need to quote all the previous commentators' opinions and debate them one by one, or other such time consuming antics. He also takes as axiomatic certain things that one may easily disagree with (e.g. the chronological nature of the prophetic books), which will influence his understanding of many of the prophecies. If one were to choose a commentator that he feels he mostly agrees with their approach, that would of course be more ideal.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.hamefitzim.co.il/Product.aspx?productid=1326\"><strong>Daat Mikra on Isaiah</strong></a>.

He too divides the book into sections and subsections. Each section is labeled with a title, elucidated with a brief commentary, and then followed by a discussion of its contents. When I used it, I read the verses without the help of his commentary (except when necessary), then read the concluding discussion for a very well-crafted summation of the overall purpose and context of the prophecy. Hacham is in general more \"academically friendly\" in the sense that he pays attention to the linguistic style of Isaiah and things like scribal additions and archaeological/historical findings, but he is also without a doubt an expert in Talmudic and midrashic literature, and of course familiar with the classic Rishonim, whom he does not hesitate to quote liberally. I found using this commentary to be especially helpful in gaining an understanding of the orginization of Isaiah as a whole as well as the overarching themes of the book, which I did not get with Judaica press or even Abarbanel.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/39986\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malbim's commentary</a> is very helpful, especially for the parts of Tanach that are not in a narrative form.

But if you look closely at the language in 21:7, what the people were really asking Moses for was forgiveness (cf: Rashi and Or haChayim on that verse). As Or haChayim points out, forgiveness has to come before the effects of that forgiveness can come, which is why Moses needs to build a serpent for people to look at before the rest of the snakes can be taken away.</p>\n\n<p>As for how the bronze serpent provided a cure, you might be interested to look at Ramban, whose interpretation is reminiscent of 19th century homeopathy (!), or consider the following passage from the Mishna:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיוצא בדבר אתה אומר עשה לך שרף ושים אתו על נס והיה כל הנשוך וראה אתו\n  וחי. וכי נחש ממית או נחש מחיה? אלא בזמן שישראל מסתכלין כלפי מעלה\n  ומשעבדין את לבם לאביהם שבשמים היו מתרפאים ואם לאו היו נמוקים</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly [to the example brought in the first half of the mishna],\n  \"Make a fiery [serpent] and place it upon a standard so that all who\n  are bitten may look at it and live\" (Numbers 21:8).

    "content": "# Becoming Deaf and Mute\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It was my understanding that the halakha differentiates between a person who cannot hear and one who can neither speak nor hear, despite the fact that the Hebrew word חרש is used for both (cf, for example: Terumot 1:1-2). It was also my understanding that a person who can neither speak nor hear is one who was born deaf, while a person who cannot hear but who can speak was one who became deaf later in life. In fact, this is how Kehati appears to understand the term in Terumot 1:2 - \"חרש המדבר ואינו שומע - כגון שהיה שומע כשנולד ואחר כך איבד את כושר השמיעה\" (\"A deaf person who can speak but who cannot hear - such as one who could hear when he was born, but who subsequently lost the faculty of hearing\").</p>\n\n<p>Bearing that distinction in mind, can somebody please explain to me how it is that Yevamot 14:1 can speak of a person \"becoming\" deaf, and subsequently becoming incapable of effecting a divorce? Given that the mishna's interpretation is dependant upon them being <em>non compos mentis</em>, I would think that it needs be referring to the case of a person who can neither speak nor hear, which is somebody born deaf. <strike>I cannot think of how a person might suddenly be stricken both deaf and dumb later on in life, such that they are no longer to be considered capable of effecting a divorce.</strike> [- or somebody who suffered a certain type of brain damage; see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26409/becoming-deaf-and-mute#comment59947_26409\">comment</a> beneath this question.]</p>\n\n<p>More particularly, I am asking the following: is the person spoken of in Yevamot 14:1 a person who was stricken both deaf and dumb later in life, or is he simply a person who has lost his hearing? Is a person who has lost his/her hearing to be considered <em>non compos mentis</em> as a result?</p>\n\n\n",

So in the verse you quoted, God promised to provide a prophet from Himself. The people could listen to this prophet while remaining loyal to the ways of God.</p>\n\n<p>The following verses speak of true prophets and false prophets, and how to tell the difference each time someone claims to be one of these people like Moses. So a fair and probably strong reading of this passage is that yes, the prophecy has been fulfilled, with every true prophet whom God allowed to be recognised by the righteous people among Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

To stop those who were coming up from the exile during the days of Koresh, who had started to build the Beis Hamikdosh, and the Cutheans slandered them and stopped them.2 But when Koresh died, and Achashveirosh reigned, and Haman was promoted, he [Haman] saw to it that those in Yerusholayim would not engage in the construction, so they [Haman’s ten sons] sent in the name of Achashveirosh to the princes of the other side of the river to stop them [from building].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Rashi states that Seder Olam is his source that the ten sons of Haman sent the accusatory letter.</p>\n<p>Next, we can look to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.16a.1?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's commentary on Megillah 16a</a>. The Talmud described how Shimshai the scribe erased the description in the king's chronicles of how Mordechai saved the king from Bigtan and Teresh and Gavriel (re)wrote it. Shimshai is not someone who appears in the text of the Megillah, but is the scribe from sefer Ezra who wrote the accusatory letter. Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמשי - סופר המלך שונא ישראל היה ומימות כורש היה כמו שנאמר בספר עזרא (סימן ד) שכתב שטנה על בנין הבית עד שבא כורש וביטלו ואף בימי אחשורוש עשה כן שנאמר (שם) ובמלכות אחשורוש בתחלת מלכותו כתב שטנה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The King's scribe.

Seder Olam which said that Haman's 10 sons sent (and perhaps therefore wrote) the accusatory letter, and the gemara in Megillah which said that Shimshai wrote the accusatory letter. Therefore, Shimshai must have been one of those 10 sons.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Yalkut Shimoni mentions that he is Hamans son in עמוס 545.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharsha (Megilla 16a) quotes this in the name of the Targum.

Wikipedia states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1871 Heinrich Graetz, drawing on Mishnaic and Talmudic sources,\n  theorized that there must have been a late 1st century Council of\n  Jamnia which had decided the Jewish canon. This became the prevailing\n  scholarly consensus for much of the 20th century. However, from the\n  1960s onwards, based on the work of Jack P. Lewis, Sidney Z. Leiman,\n  and others, this view came increasingly into question. In particular,\n  later scholars noted that none of the sources actually mentioned books\n  that had been withdrawn from a canon, and questioned the whole premise\n  that the discussions were about canonicity at all, asserting that they\n  were actually dealing with other concerns entirely.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jacob Neusner published books in 1987 and 1988 that argued that the\n  notion of a biblical canon was not prominent in second-century\n  Rabbinic Judaism or even later and instead that a \"notion of Torah\"\n  was expanded to include the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud,\n  Babylonian Talmud and midrashim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can anyone quote the specific Mishnaic and Talmudic sources here? Are there any additional pre-19th century sources that speak about the Council of Jamnia/Yavneh?</p>\n\n<p><em>Please note that this question is not asking for arguments supporting or refuting the Council of Jamnia/Yavneh, it is asking for pre-19th century sources.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub><a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/a/8446/1304\">Here</a>, <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/a/3393/1304\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/a/4452/1304\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/a/5868/1304\">here</a>. Two of these do mention that the council may not have occurred, the other two take it as a given that it did.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Jack P. Lewis' chapter \"Jamnia Revisited,\" contained in the 2002 anthology <i>The Canon Debate</i> (McDonald & Sanders, editors), the theory that the Tanach was fixed by a Council of Jamnia about 90 CE was first proposed by Heinrich Graetz in 1871. W. M. Christie was the first to dispute this popular theory in the July 1925 edition of The Journal of Theological Studies in an article entitled \"The Jamnia Period in Jewish History\". And the theory began to go into further disfavor following a critique by Lewis in the April 1964 edition of the Journal of Bible and Religion entitled \"What Do We Mean by Jabneh?\", and other critiques thereafter by Raymond E. Brown and Sid Z. Leiman.  Today, Lewis says, the theory is largely discredited.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b-15a) and Rashi's commentary to Talmud tractate Megillah 3a, 14a, much of the contents of the Tanach was compiled by the Men of the Great Assembly (Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah), by about the year 450 BCE, and have remained unchanged since that date.</p>\n\n<p>While Rabbi Akiva, for example, appears to have been involved in the debate to include Song of Songs into the canon (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%92_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Yadayim 3:5</a>), I think he was merely defending its inclusion after the fact, and that the post-Temple rabbis did not take part in the canonization of the Tanach.  While there are other examples of Tannaim discussing the relative merits of some of the kesuvim, and whether they deserved to be included in Tanach, there does not appear to be any chain of tradition to tell us that the Tannaim (or there predecessors, including the Anshei K'nesset Gedolah) actually conducted anything like what we would call canonization.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, he should give names from Tanach, and names of Tzadikim that have holiness and purity and bring blessings and cause a positive effect on the child. In the majority of cases, new names not only do not have any holiness, but additionaly have no positive meaning, and only in rare cases have positive connontations. Therefore, one should avoid using new and modern names. <em>Source</em>: R' Chaim Kanievsky, as I heard directly from him on numerous occasions. I presented him with over 200 new names, [asking] if one should call them or not. He erased almost all of them, and said to me, \"Is there and shortage of names in Tanach, that one needs to make up and find new names!\" (Chapter 15:1, and footnote 2 there).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems the objection was more to the idea of <em>innovating</em> new and modern names, rather than something against <em>non-Tanach</em> names.</p>\n<p>In his introduction to the Sefer, he proposes two explanations for this opinion: He suggests that based on the Arizal who says that since the time of the second Beis Hamikdosh, there are no longer new souls brought down, but only re-incarnations. Since the name of a person is connected to the soul, it follows that there should no longer be new names invented. Another possible reason is based on Breishes Rabba 37:7 which states that, \"The earlier [generations] would utilize Ruach Hakodesh, and name according to the events that happened. However we do not use Ruach Hakodesh, and give names from earlier generations.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps he was talking about names in Hebrew specifically, as it is considered a holy language. Therefore, a Yiddish name (which may be derived from German, Slavic, or some other Ashkenazim language) would be okay. Also, saying that you shouldn't name your child something officially doesn't stop them from having that name. Of course, they could take up a modern Hebrew nickname, which you would have no control over. However, one shouldn't assume responsibility for someone else's nickname (in my opinion). I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Toynbee's description of Jews as a \"fossil\" -- what was the Orthodox response?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the 1950s historian Arnold Toynbee made the argument that Jews and Judaism did not fit into any definition of nation, race, or religion.  We were not a nation because we lived for centuries without a land and our people were scattered throughout the world.  We were not a race because we accepted converts.  And we were not solely a religion because we counted among our numbers people who do not believe in G-d.  But given the Jewish presence in world history for more than 3000 years, he classified us as a \"fossil.\"  His comment led to a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M5Ntu3C0IA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">famous debate</a> with Yaakov Herzog.  Did any of the great post-Holocaust sages publish a response as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>Regarding Yaakov Herzog's participation in the debate with Toynbee, R. Mordechai Elefant, in his unpublished memoirs, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yakov Herzog was ambassador to Canada for a few years during the early\nsixties. He met the British historian Arnold Toynbee there. Toynbee\nwas anti-Israel, and he was no great friend of the Jews. Herzog and\nToynbee started arguing, and one of them challenged the other to a\npublic debate. Herzog was anxious do do it, but he couldn't do\nsomething like that on his own; he needed Ben Gurion's okay. Ben\nGurion didn't veto it, but he wasn't keen on the idea. Yakov went to\nRav Aharon Kotler. He and Rav Aharon were very close because when Rav\nAharon would go to Dublin raising funds for his yeshivah in Kletzk,\nRabbi Herzog would let him stay at his house studying Talmud, while he\n[R. Herzog] raised the money for him. They stayed great friends, and\nRav Aharon got to know Rabbi Herzog's children very well. It's no\ncoincidence that Yakov went to study under Rav Aharon's father in law,\nRav Isser Zalman Meltzer.</p>\n<p>So Yakov asked Rav Aharon what he should do.\nHe told him, \"If you think you'll win, do it. Otherwise, don't.\" Yakov\ntold Rav Aharon that he was sure he would win, but still, he would\nagree to debate only on one condition -- that Rav Aharon, Rav Moshe\nFeinstein, and Rav Yakov Kamenetsky would pray for him during the\ndebate. All three of them agreed. He won hands down. Even Toynbee\nconceded that in a letter he wrote to him. GET COPY OF LETTER FROM\nHERZOG'S WIDOW, COUSING OF HIRSHOWITZ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding Herzog's victory in the debate, see also <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/1.4954029\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Berkovits\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Eliezer Berkovits</a> wrote a book in response called \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judaism;_Fossil_or_Ferment?tab=contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judaism: Fossil or Ferment?</a>.\"</p>\n<p>In his recent <a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/10/on-creative-minorities\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Erasmus Lecture</a>, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks responded to Toynbee's critique of Judaism (starting at 25 min.)</p>\n<p>R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik, in his <em>Abraham's Journey</em>, responds to an article criticizing Jewish students for arguing about the ancient past instead of focusing on the present. In his response, R. Soloveitchik notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The conclusion [the author] arrived at was obviously and unequivocally\nreminiscent of Toynbee's interpretation of Jewish history, wherein the\nliving Jewish historical drama came to a stop with the rise of\nChristianity, when our people forfeited its political independence.\nThere is no longer a growing, developing, destiny-conscious Jewish\nnation, but only a fossilized or mummified community that lives on in\nmemories and thinks in retrospective terms. Using an almost vulgar\npseudo-scientific idiom, the author of the article spoke of the frozen\nstream of the collective consciousness and the absence of continuity\nand creativity within it...</p>\n<p>It appears to me that the answer to this\nquestion is simple enough, and it is to be found in the unique time\nawareness of our historic community. Our time experience is\nthree-dimensional; past and future address themselves to us in the\nfleeting moment of the present. We live, of course, in the so-called\npresent, but it can envelop us only if it is interlocked with the\nother two dimensions. The retrospective mood is one of the major\nmotifs our our time apprehension, and so is the glance that we cast at\nthe silent morrow, and the \"not yet,\" at the expected and fervently\ndesired or hated. Retrospection in the sense of reliving and\nreincarnating and anticipation, which gives rise to a new world,\nconstitute the central motifs of our unique time experience. We see\nthe distances separating the ages and millenia as not so pronounced as\nin general history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In his work <em>Festival of Freedom</em>, pp. 156-157, R. Soloveitchik wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People have no idea how much freedom we have in interpreting the\nTorah. They speak about the Halakhah as fossilized, but people who say\nso simply do not know what Halakhah is; they have never studied\nHalakhah. If there is an area in which human ingenuity, freedom of\nresearch, sweep, and depth play a role, it is in the area of\nHalakhah...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On another instance, R. Soloveitchik <a href=\"https://yated.com/grand-showdown-women-rabbis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commented</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to speak about halachah as a fossil, Rachmana litzlon, is ridiculous.\nBecause we know, those who study halachah know, it is a living,\ndynamic discipline that was given to man in order to redeem him and to\nsave him. We are opposed to shinuyim (changes) of course, but chiddush\nis certainly the very essence of halachah. There are no shinuyim in\nhalachah, but there are great chiddushim. But the chiddushim are\nwithin the system, not from the outside. You cannot pychologize\nhalachah, historicize halachah, or rationalize halachah, because this\nis something foreign, something extraneous. As a matter of fact, not\nonly halachah – can you psychologize mathematics? I will ask you a\nquestion about mathematics – let us take Euclidian geometry. I cannot\ngive many psychological reasons why Euclid said two parallels do not\ncross, or why the shortest distance between two points is a straight\nline. If I were a psychologist, I could not interpret it in\npsychological terms. Would it change the postulate, the mathematical\npostulate? And when it comes to Torah, which is Hakadosh Boruch Hu,\nall the instruments of psychology and history, utilitarian morality,\nare being used to undermine the very authority of the halachah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Norman Lamm wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More than once do I recall from my own\nexperience being introduced to a well-meaning stranger as an Orthodox\nJew or Rabbinical student, or Orthodox Rabbi. To my infinite annoyance\nthere spreads on the face of the stranger the look of incredulousness,\nand he says:, \"Orthodox — and you so young?\" As if Torah were an\naffliction brought on by old age, a kind of spiritual geriatrics. How\nfrustrating and often how futile to have to explain that to be \"frum\"\nis not to be a fossil, and to be religious is not to be a relic...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No doubt many of those here today have had similar experiences. Someone learns you are an observant Orthodox Jew, and he clucks his tongue in sympathy, feeling genuinely sorry for you, and responds in a half-admiring and half-pitying tone: You observe the Sabbath, with all its restrictions? You cannot smoke or travel or write?\" And we must explain: Sabbath is for us not a day of gloom and restriction, but one of עונג, unadulterated joy, when (without being an ecstatic mystic) an ordinary observant Jew can experience נשמה יתירה, the \"additional soul\" that comes from a day of pure rest and recreation, when we feel liberated from the tyranny of all the pettiness that surrounds us during the week. Or someone discovers that you believe in and practice the laws of \"family purity.\" And again the incredulous reaction, with a mixture of pity and admiration: \"You really practice these ascetic regulations denying your basic drives?\" And we have to explain so patiently: No, it is not asceticism, but a healthy and vital self-discipline, which ennobles the animal within us and purifies and sublimates it, and makes of marriage a dream, not a nightmare. So, we observe Kashruth and we expect no awards and want no sympathy for it. It simply is part of our life of קדושה, the practical program of Jewish holiness and differentness. And the very fact of the observance of Kashruth away from home, with all the minor inconveniences it entails, that by itself gives us the feeling of being at home everywhere!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indeed in every area of life, the outsider sees only size and number rather than content and quality, the conventional rather than the moral, the fashionable rather than that which is indeed dignified, opinions rather than ideas. He beholds a synagogue and can see only the membership and budget and activities and aesthetics.

    "content": "# Why is kosher wine or grape juice rare alone but less so as an ingredient?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding is that wine or grape juice is <em>s'tam yenam</em> and forbidden if handled by non-Jews without having been cooked. (See, e.g., <a href=\"http://chabad.org/82688\" rel=\"noreferrer\">an explanation on <code>chabad.org</code></a>.) The practical result of this, for the consumer, is that wine and grape juice (in the United States, say) are almost always manufactured by a religious-Jewish-owned company, or on a run for its label: one hardly sees wine or grape juice on the market that is kosher but manufactured by a general-market company. Yet one <em>does</em> see general-market, kosher goods with wine or grape juice as an ingredient. Why?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it that some <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/585\"><em>heter</em></a>, not relied on for pure wine or grape juice, is relied on when the wine or grape juice is merely an ingredient? What <em>heter</em>?</li>\n<li>Or is it that I'm wrong that <em>s'tam yenam</em> is the reason that major brands' wine and grape juice isn't kosher, and there's some other, not <em>halacha</em>-related reason (which therefore doesn't apply to such wine- and grape-juice-containing products)? What reason?</li>\n<li>Or what?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"http://www.kikkomanusa.com/homecooks/about.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kikkoman Foods</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.kikkomanusa.com/homecooks/products/products_hc_details.php?pf=10201\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce</a> lists wine as its second  ingredient (right after soy sauce) and is certified as kosher by the Orthodox Union (as of this writing). As another, many a brand of dijon mustard, containing white wine as an ingredient, is certified kosher by, for example, OK Kosher.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I've been part of a group that did Hashgacha on a production of grape concentrate for the OU.

The grapes were taken directly from the field to the crusher and were completely processed on premises. This probably makes grape juice concentrate logistically much easier to produce in a kosher manner than grape juice itself, which has additional factors that (I'm assuming) must be taken into account such as the kashrut status of the bottling facility and transportation of the juice to said bottling facility.</p>\n\n<p>It may just not be worth it for the companies to pay the added expense needed to make kosher grape juice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Seems that either they use wine/grape juice concentrate</strong> (assuming it was Halachicly <em>cooked</em> when it's concentrated) <strong>or else they use Kosher Wine under supervision</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Once wine is  added to the mix (or spices to the wine) it no longer has the problem of <em>s'tam yenam</em>,</strong> and no longer needs tight \"Kosher Wine\" supervision, as explained below:</p>\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 123:4  סימן קכג - כמה דינין מיין נסך, (ואיזו יין נאסר משום יין נסך)‏  where it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>יַיִן שֶׁמְּעָרְבִין בּוֹ דְּבַשׁ וּפִלְפְּלִין, אִם נִשְׁתַּנָּה טַעֲמוֹ מֵחֲמָתָם אֵינוֹ נֶאֱסָר בְּמַגַּע עוֹבְדֵי כּוֹכָבִים. וְהוּא הַדִּין בִּדְבַשׁ</strong> (ד) <strong>לְחוּד אוֹ פִּלְפְּלִין לְחוּד</strong> (בֵּית יוֹסֵף בְּשֵׁם תְּשׁוּבַת רַשְׁבָּ''א) . ‏</p>\n<p>באר היטב  (ד) <strong>לחוד</strong>. כל שנשתנה טעם היין ונראה דה''ה שאר דברים כל שנשתנה טעמו מחמתן כ''כ בד''מ: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wine that has honey and pepper mixed into it, if this causes taste [of the wine] to change, it is not forbidden if a non-Jew touches it.

In nearly every country there is a small group of people obsessed with psychedelic drugs, and they pretty much approve of them all. Since they are ideologues, they have no credibility. Don't listen to them.</p>\n\n<p>These mushrooms were not known to people outside of Mexico/Central America until very recent times. So the Torah says nothing about it. But major gedolim such as R' Moshe Feinstein have said not to use marijuana (which is a mild hallucinogen so it's also a psychedelic). And there is no respected Orthodox rabbi I'm aware of who has approved of any illegal drug use.</p>\n\n<p>Common sense, scientific evidence and common experience also should keep us from using this drug. As with any psychedelic drug, there are grave risks of severe, long-lasting psychological problems, such as permanent perceptual changes (\"hallucinogen persisting perception disorder\" or HPPD), panic attacks, and anxiety problems. There is also the danger that one will have experiences which one thinks are genuine spiritual experiences but in fact are misleading or dangerous. For this reason, some kabbalists (such as Rabbi Ariel bar Tzadok) do not take anyone as a student who has used psychedelic drugs.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah requires us to guard our health. That includes our mental health, of course. So we should avoid all illegal drugs, and psychedelic drugs in particular, like the plague.</p>\n\n<p>If you want an interesting or transcendental experience, Judaism provides traditional means for doing so: prayer, meditation, fasting, wine, dancing, music, etc. These are safe in moderation.

Although I asked a certain R' Sokol, and was told that the gemara in a different location says \"once the beis hamikdash was destroyed, the taste of fruits was annulled.\" He said this means there is no longer fruit that raises consciousness, it only comes from herbs and grasses. The mishkan was made almost entirely of acacia or mimosa wood, both of the worlds most potent hallucinogens. The anointing oil contained \"kaneh bosom\" which R' Aryeh Kaplan identifies as cannabis. The Holy Zohar says that, \"There is no grass or herb that grows in which G-d's wisdom\nis not greatly manifested and which cannot exert great influence in heaven\" and \"If men\nbut knew the wisdom of all the Holy One, blessed be He, has planted in the earth, and\nthe power of all that is to be found in the world, they would proclaim the power of their Lrd in His great wisdom\" (Zoh.

I remember hearing from one rabbi that the gemara says \"When the temple was destroyed, prophecy was given to the insane, children, and dogs\" If you take a chemical that makes you  \"insane\" maybe you can get prophecy, who knows.

The Gemara (Megillah 14a) teaches us that the sages of the time did not want to institute the reading of the Megillah, because no other prophets had ever added or subtracted from the Torah, and now, for the first time Mordechai and Esther wished to add something new. </p>\n\n<p>It was only when they realized that there is a <em>kal va-chomer</em> argument in favor of instituting the Megillah reading that it was allowed. The <em>kal va-chomer</em> is: מה מעבדות לחירות אמרינן שירה ממות לחיים לא כל שכן--if going from slavery to freedom we sing a song, certainly when going from death to life we should sing.

The man requested\n  help, to which he responded, ‘I cannot.’ The gentile said to him, “You\n  can, but you just do not want to.” Regarding this Rebbe Zusia said to\n  himself that it must be an allusion to the fallen <em>hey</em> (referring to\n  the fifth letter in the Hebrew alphabet) represented in God’s name. It\n  has fallen and it is in my power to pick it up, I just don’t want to.\n  And so it is with all occurrences that chance upon a person, for all\n  worldly events are really spiritual allusions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that we sing the song to the tune of \"Pick a Bale of Hay\" to allude to our obligation to lift up the <em>hey</em> of God's name. This is particularly relevant on Purim, because as Chazal on the verse כי יד על כס י-ה teach us, אין השם שלם ואין הכסא שלם עד שימחה שמו של עמלק. </p>\n\n\n",

His mother comes down with her husband and son to Timna, and then leaves the narrative entirely, presumably because she severs all ties to him due to his choice (or perhaps coincidentally dies exactly at that point, although that is unlikely).

I know that usually, <em>Yom Nicanor</em> is displaced by the Fast of Esther.  But in years (such as 2013 / 5773) when the Fast of Esther is displaced due to Shabbat, may Hallel be said on the 13th of Adar, [<em>Yom Nicanor</em>]?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I will try to answer the first question on whether Hallel was recited on Yom Nicanor, using classical and rabbinic evidence.</p>\n<p>There are no sources that record the recitation of Hallel in the celebration of Yom Nicanor. The strongest evidence to indicate that it was said occurs in the Second Book of Maccabees (ch.15), one of the texts historically closest to the recorded event:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the action was over and they were leaving with joy, they recognized Nicanor, lying dead, in full armor. <strong>Then there was shouting and tumult, and they blessed the sovereign in the language of the fathers</strong>...And they all decreed by public vote never to let this day go unobserved but to have the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar in the Syrian language, marked, the day before Mordechai's Day [i.e., Purim].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is similar to 1 Maccabees 7:48:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the people rejoiced exceedingly, and they spent that day with great joy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rejoicing and blessing Hashem \"in the language of the fathers\" sounds like Hallel, but there's no way of really knowing. Classical historians would likely argue against that idea, considering the increasing rift between the Pharisees and the Hasmoneans, who were supporting the Sadduccees (Samuel Rocca). Other classical sources, like Polybius <em>Histories</em> 31.22, either ignore the holiday, or they discuss Yom Nicanor as a day of celebration, but with no explicit mention of Hallel. Significantly, Josephus (Ant. 12.412) writes that people continued celebrating the holiday even after the Hasmonean dynasty was conquered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Jews celebrate their victory every year in this month, and observe this day as a festival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my humble opinion, rabbinic sources seem to indicate that Hallel was not recited on Yom Nicanor. I have two explanations to corroborate this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>None of the rabbinic sources available during the time of its celebration (<em>Megillat Ta'anit</em>, Talmud Bavli, Yerushalmi) mention a history of reciting Hallel during Yom Nicanor. The texts either discuss the story behind the holiday with detail or limit its rituals to a day when \"one is not to fast and...not to eulogize.\"</li>\n<li>Yom Nicanor was still celebrated during the Gaonic period, even after <em>Megillat Ta'anit</em> was nullified, when the institution of reciting Hallel during a holiday was widely known. <em>Masekhet Soferim</em> discusses the issue of when to fast for Purim (before <em>Ta'anit Esther</em> was codified as the 13th of Adar):</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נהגו להתענות אחר ימי הפורים, מפני ניקנור וחביריו</p>\n<p>The custom is to fast after the days of Purim, because of Nicanor and his colleagues (17:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This text proves that Yom Nicanor had some status as a holiday during the Gaonic period. Nevertheless, three chapters later, <em>Masekhet Soferim</em> also records the 18 days and 1 night that we recite Hallel (20:7; see also <em>Ta'anit</em> 28b, where the Babylonian custom to recite Hallel on Rosh Chodesh is mentioned alongside the list), with no mention of Yom Nicanor. Although it's possible to argue that this shows no <em>mitzvah</em> to recite Hallel on Yom Nicanor, its absence from the Hallel list likely suggests that it was a minor holiday that people did not recite Hallel for.</p>\n<p>If it was not practiced, there is not a lot of support for now instituting its recitation for Yom Nicanor during the years when <em>Ta'anit Esther</em> is displaced.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps in many cases people do not know a bona fide poor person and therefore even prefer a messenger. The messenger would have a responsibility to give the money to the poor person on Purim, this way the giver is fulfilling  their obligation.

Why would the Angel Gavriel choose to make her have a tail?  Is there some significance?</p>\n\n<p>3) Is this to be taken literally?</p>\n\n<p>4) Why in the second answer is גבריאל (Gavriel) mentioned?  Why didn't he bring about the Tzarat?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the text of the גמרא:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תלמוד בבלי מסכת מגילה דף יב/ב </p>\n  \n  <p>מאי טעמא לא אתאי אמר רבי יוסי בר חנינא מלמד שפרחה בה צרעת \n  במתניתא תנא בא גבריאל ועשה לה זנב </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Although the word זנב does sometimes mean a tail, it is actually a generic word. This is how the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42538&st=&pgnum=108&hilite=\">ספר הערוך</a> defines it: כל דבר שהוא יתר שאינו כמדת חברו משתנה מכמות שהוא ממה שהעולם נוהג קרוי זנב - anything which is extra or which is not the same size as the adjoining one or which is different from what is usual elsewhere, is called a זנב.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore a suitable generic translation here would be an appendage, and at least one of the commentaries (I think the Alshich) explains that it means that she had a big growth on her forehead.</p>\n\n<p>According to this, the extra disfigurement meant that she would have refused to show herself at Achashverosh's feast even if she would have been allowed to appear fully clothed.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps the גמרא is providing two separate answers to one question.  The question is what prevented Vashti from following Achashveirosh’s request to attend the party.\nThe first answer to this question appears straight forward.  Vashti had some skin problem that made her feel unable to go before Achashveirosh.  Perhaps her she felt unattractive, like some woman feel before going to an event.  Perhaps her vanity would not let her go.   </p>\n\n<p>The גמרא presents an alternative approach.  Vashti grew a tail.  Obviously people don’t grow tails.  So, what is the message that the גמרא is trying to convey.  A tail is something you would find on an animal.  Perhaps the message is that Vashti perceived something.  She recognized that she was being objectified.  Achasveirosh wanted her to appear in front of her guests to show off her beauty.  She was not being viewed as a human with a mind and personality.  She was being viewed as purely a beautiful creature.  She was being reduced from being a human to merely her physical body, like an animal devoid of a mind.<br>\nPeople might normally not object to this because they imagine that they are being appreciated for both mind and body.  There is a combination.  Like by a beauty pageant there is a blend of focus.  It is not just the swimsuit competition, but a demonstration of their talents and personality and intelligence.  These elements make it palatable for people.  But somehow the providence revealed to Vashti that in this situation the people are just viewing her as this “animal”, this body to satisfy the onlookers and Achashveirosh’s ego.  People do not like to be reduced to being all about their body.  People don’t like to be focused purely on the instinctual.  We cover that up.  We eat with manners and formality to remove the activity from being “animalistic”.  People are uncomfortable when things remind them that they have these base animalistic instincts.  Vashti was uncomfortable with this.\n Perhaps the inclusion of Gavriel the מלאך is to indicate that under normal circumstances Vashti would not have this realization. However, in this instance Vashti was assisted to clearly see how she was being viewed and made to be seen as an object.  This was unacceptable to Vashti.  </p>\n\n<p>In other words, she was by nature a prutzah (translation?) and under normal circumstances would have done this without hesitation as the Gemara indicates (מגילה דף יב). However, the answer of the Tail is suggesting that with the help of the Hashgacha (providence) she had a realization that she normally would not have. That is implied by Gavriel. This was out of the ordinary that she was able to see this idea. The Hashgacha helped her to see how she was being perceived so to speak.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>1) Indeed, if you have one midrash, you don't need the other. This is likely a disagreement, rather than an assertion that both happened.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yossi ben Hanina, the one who stated that it was tzaraat, is an Amora of Eretz Yisrael. As Tosafot notes on the daf, in the parallel Yerushalmi, we find out that this is a derasha on the word nigzar in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3302.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Esther 2:1</a>:</p>\n\n<p>וְאֵת אֲשֶׁר-נִגְזַר עָלֶיהָ</p>\n\n<p>The word nigzar also occurs by Uzziah, a king who brought ketores, though he was not a kohen, and was stricken with leprosy.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the brayta presumably derives the tail from some other source. According to Tosafot HaRosh, it is the word עָלֶיהָ in the same phrase. Written with an aleph instead of an ayin, it would be read alya, which means a tail.</p>\n\n<p>2) A person grows a tail suddenly as a result of a miracle. While I'm sure some people explain the significance of specifically a tail, I would personally note that the rules of midrashic interpretation will restrict the details of the midrash to specifically that which can be deduced from the pasuk via midrashic rules. This was a means of suddenly marring her beauty, such that (based on the context of the gemara) though she would normally have loved to lewdly display her naked body, here she was embarrassed.</p>\n\n<p>3) It depends. I would say yes, the rabbis who wrote this did intend them literally, though we do not have to agree that it historically occurred. Alternatively, it is meant metaphorically. See my discussions of this <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2007/03/further-perils-of-taking-midrashim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2007/03/considering-vashtis-tail-and-esthers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>4) I don't know. Different midrashic authors might mention different details. I don't know what specifically brings Gavriel in here, or if there is a running tradition of Gavriel secretly guiding all sorts of events in the megillah. For example, see Megillah 16a, where Shamshai the scribe erased what Mordechai had done to save the king from Bigtan and Teresh, but the angel Gavriel came and rewrote it. Note also that the entire second answer is in square brackets in our gemaras. I am not sure what that means, or what alternate girsa exists there.</p>\n\n\n",

In this case it has a <em>siman</em> (distinguishing feature) in that you know to whom the money belongs (the organization marked on the charity box).</p>\n<p>In a case like this, the one who finds the money must inform the organization that it should pick up its money (and he doesn't have an obligation to spend money/time to bring the money to the organization). In the meantime, the money should be safely kept aside until the organization comes to pick it up.</p>\n<p>For fungible items (like money), one is permitted to use them if the owner doesn't come back for them, with the condition one will replace them when the owner comes. In your practical example, after a reasonable waiting period (a month?), the synagogue could use this money for its own needs as long as it has money set aside when the owner comes back to claim it.</p>\n<p>It is possible however to change how the \"default law\" through public posting of a lost-and-found policy (or in this case a \"Purim charity box policy\". To quote R Yisroel Pinchos Bodner (<a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/halachos-of-other-peoples-money-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachos of other people's money</a>, ch. 185)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Any institution or individual catering to the public</strong> (e.g., yeshivos,\nshuls, stores), <strong>has a right to make their own lost-and-found policy\ngoverning what will be done with items left behind on their property</strong>.\nThe owner of a property can require that people who enter do so on the\ncondition that anything they leave behind may be disposed of according\nto the way the owner says it will be disposed of.</p>\n<p>In order for the policy to take effect the institution must display it\nprominently for all to see (e.g., a notice on the bulletin board). For\nexample, <strong>the institution may introduce a policy stating that anything\nleft behind on their facilities will be</strong> placed in a lost-and-found\nroom (or cabinet), and <strong>disposed of after a specified time</strong> (e.g., the\nend of every semester, etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So it appears to me the behavior you describe is halachically permitted, although it would be wise for the synagogue to allow the charity organization to claim its money even beyond the time mentioned on the policy.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Something about those words, specifically, is bothering him, and I propose that it's the repetition. When the king's word arrived somewhere, so did the new law. The 'word' <em>was</em> the law! Why say both? So <em>Rashi</em> tells us: \"כשהשלוחים נושאי הספרים עוברים שם נתנה הדת בעיר\", \"when the messengers carrying the letters passed there, the law was placed in the city\". This \"law was placed\" can't mean that they put a copy of the law down in the town square, or it begs the question. I think it means that the law <em>became effective</em> in each city when it was announced there. That is, the way royal edicts worked in Persia was that they went into effect in a city only when the message reached that city. So the Jews in each city were not merely hearing the news that, several days or weeks prior, the king had made a new and terrible law, but were, rather, were hearing the news that a new and terrible law had just been enacted.

    "content": "# May I buy and use cheap fakes instead of paying full price for brand-name clothes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>An old friend recently asked me to purchase some replica \"beats\" (headphones made by monster) which authentically (depending on the model cost between 120$-500$) so I started to look them up online and found ones that cost 400$ authentically for 50$ (replica). One day I was walking around the Bet Midrash and I find this book called copyright in Jewish law so I opened it and decided to look up my case of Halacha and it seemed from there that it would be Asur to purchase these replicas so I sent some to ask the Rosh Kolel of Hoshen Mishpat at the Bet Midrash. He replied that it would be Asur to purchase. However, I wondered to myself how all the time I see Jews wearing replica Louis Vuitton belts etc. so I asked my friend to ask his Posek in Israel (I have to talk to him directly BN tommorrow) but it seemed like the Posek in Israel was Matir. Does anyone have any information about this? What about placing a logo on an item such as Louis Vuitton logo onto a car (for example)? </p>\n\n<p>Sumamry: are replica items of clothing etc. (e.g. Louis Vuitton belts) Mutar to be purchased? And if purchased must they be returned or destroyed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This question can be approached from different perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>First is the is what the law of the land is.  Although halacha does not always follow secular law, in questions of business conduct we are obligated to follow the law of the land, which we know by the term \"dina d'malchuso dina.\"  On this, Rav Yitzchak Shmelkes (Beit Yitzchak, Yoreh De'ah 2:75) wrote, \"I am not aware of any Torah source that prohibits copying a Torah work without the authority and permission of the author.\" However, he states that one must obey copyright laws that the civil government enacts due to the Talmudic rule of \"dina demalchuta dina.\" This rule, literally, \"the law of the government is the law,\" obligates Jews to follow many laws of the land in which they dwell.  So, if secular copyright law makes it illegal to make and sell imitation products, then that is reason enough for Jewish law to forbid trading in such illegal items.  Note that these days copyrights extend not to just works of writing, but to designs, music, and computer programs, for example.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we want to avoid participating in a fraud.  If the seller is selling a Rolex for $250 on the street, its either fake or stolen.  Selling things under a famous trade name, when they were not manufactured by that company, is a violation of the Biblical principal of \"ona'ah\" (cheating someone in business). Lev. 25:14 (\"And if you sell anything to your fellow or buy anything from your fellow’s hand, you shall not wrong (AL TONU) one another\").  See Bava Metzia 49b - 58b.  Likewise, buying knockoffs is also forbidden, even if you personally know they are imitation, as you are supporting the sinner's activity.  </p>\n\n<p>But a different case would be if a manufacturer made something that looked similar but not identical to a more expensive design, and did not claim it to be anything other than what it is. For example, when my wife and I were getting married, we registered for a china pattern that was similar to a Royal Daulton design we liked, but made by Mikassa and noticeably different than the Royal Daulton so much that they could not be confused.  Since we paid the value of a Mikassa and not a Royal Daulton, the transaction was totally honest and there was no issue of \"ona'ah.\"</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to the Rolex watches for sale cheap, I mentioned that there is a possibility that instead of being fake, it was stolen.  Where one has reason to believe that the goods are not imitation but stolen then it is forbidden to buy such objects (see Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 366.1). Even if this is only a suspicion (but one based on good assumptions, such as the price is incredibly low, or its being sold in a suspicious way etc) it is also forbidden to buy it (see Taz ibid). </p>\n\n\n",

In fact, it would seem that these editions are even specifically rejected by many who support the Artscroll.</p>\n\n<p>What causes for rejection of these were not present in Artscroll, and/or what causes for support of the Artscroll were not present in these earlier editions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Adam Mintz has written a fine essay called <a href=\"http://printingthetalmud.org/essays/13.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Talmud in Translation</a>, in which he elaborates on the history of the Artscroll, Steinsaltz, and Soncino Talmuds and the various polemics concerning each. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding \"rejections,\" there have been critiques for each Talmud. </p>\n\n<p>On the Soncino, there was a little controversy that concerned making the Talmud accessible to non-Jew if it was translated.</p>\n\n<p>On the Steinsaltz, many in the charedi world followed R. Schach's condemnation because \"it was \nwritten by the same author who penned several books that they considered to contain words of heresy.\" Regarding the translation, R. Schach disapproved of its modern Hebrew translation and the \"secular\" style of its study aids. </p>\n\n<p>These issues are just as relevant for the Artscroll Talmud, but perhaps their haskamot from R. Elyashiv and R. Schechter have opened more doors for chareidi acceptance. </p>\n\n<p>Like Charles Koppelman, I disagree with your premise that the Steinsaltz and Soncino Talmuds \"have not received anywhere near the same levels of support.\" See, for example, the powerful haskamot reprinted in the new Steinsaltz translation. I know many in Israel prefer the Steinsaltz over the Artscroll, and there are various reasons, such R. Steinsaltz pedagogic honesty on translating controversial statements in the gemara, the encyclopedic information to facilitate study, and a general method of providing the tools to start digging rather than do all the work for you. </p>\n\n<p>This is popularity is certainly true in modern orthodox/daati leumi communities. I mention this because I personally believe political divisions between the daati leumi (which many identify R. Steinsaltz under) and chareidi (e.g., Artscroll) world have a lot to do with this discussion of acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>The Soncino, however, might lack the same contemporary support simply due to antiquated aesthetics, lack of study guides, and more archaic translations in comparison to the other two. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I've never heard any objection to Soncino specifically. I've heard objection to translated editions generally — and the very explicatory ArtScroll English edition especially — from teachers: namely, that these editions make it too easy for students to make their way through the <em>g'mara</em>, and the student loses out on the benefits (spiritual and pedagogical) of struggling to understand the <em>g'mara</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I disagree with the premise of the question, but I have some reasons why it might be perceived that way.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that Artscroll has a higher marketing budget than most Jewish publishing houses. The support that it advertizes might feel larger than Soncino or Steinsaltz because those publishers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>did not distribute their books as widely before and after publication soliciting opinions.</li>\n<li>did not talk to the right people in the right way.</li>\n<li>do not have the same built-in market that Artscroll does with its siddurs, chumashes, Tanakhs, etc.</li>\n<li>do not have the same size (or the same stature) built-in ideological market.</li>\n<li>do not advertize nearly as well.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On the other hand, one thing that's always great about Artscroll is the formatting.  Translating the Talmud is complex, especially when you add in interpretation and commentary.  Artscroll manages to be user-friendly in a way most other publications are not.  They font is better, the layout is better, the spacing is better, etc.<sup>1</sup>  </p>\n\n<p>Artscroll is also cheaper than most Talmud editions, which makes it more common to own. </p>\n\n<p>Also, Artscroll tends to be easier for new learners than Soncino, specifically, which is fairly hard to understand.  Whether that's a benefit <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/26606/1498\">is debatable</a>, of course.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup><sub>I think if Artscroll published the first chumashes, Rashi script wouldn't need to exist.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is a \"migu\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A popular topic discussed sometimes at length in Yeshivas I would like to pose the question here with a few additional points:</p>\n\n<p>What is a \"migu\"?\nHow is it used in Shas?\nWhat is a \"classic\" (or <em>the</em> classic) example of a migu?\nAre there any \"earlier seforim\" (before the achronim) that explain what a \"migu\" is, how it's used, etc\nWhat is an example of the concept of a \"migu\" being used in practical halacha? (source.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Migu is a Rabbinic concept in which a witness establishes his reliability by his choice of defenses.  It goes like this: a claimant has a sure-win claim, but instead offers an alternative defense which, on its own, we would not believe but for the fact that he could have chosen the sure-win claim.  We say to ourselves, \"if this guy was lying, he would have chosen a better argument.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Many cases come to mind.  In Kesuvos 12b there is a case where a woman claims she lost her signs of virginity when she was raped -- she is believed because she could have claims that she lost the signs due to an accident (and thereby retain her right to a 200 zuzim value to her kesubah; because she claimed to be raped, she only will get 100 zuzim).</p>\n\n<p>At Bava Basra 31a, Shimon claims to own land and Reuven disputes.  Shimon has a migu claim:  He says that he has lived on the land for 3 years and thereby acquired the land.  He could have claimed that he had bought the land from Reuven's father and, although he has no receipt, his possession of the land for 3 years supports his claim.  By making the lesser argument, we assume that he's telling the truth.  However, in the Bava Basra case, Reuven trumps Shimon by bringing two witnesses.  Migu is good; witnesses are better.</p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine, a convert, was living in Jerusalem and the rabbis were reluctant to accept his conversion because the rabbis on the convert's bet din were not on the official government list of approved conversion rabbis.  Converts in Israel are questioned because conversion grants one the capability of making aliyah with full immigration rights.  Therefore there is incentive for an insincere person to \"convert.\"  But my friend was able to bring proof that he had divorced his wife by giving her a get.  They accepted that as a migu.  He could have claimed to have been born Jewish and would not have been easily disputed.  But the fact that he admitted to giving his wife a get and that he was a convert demonstrated that he was a ger tzedek because an insincere convert would not have bothered to divorce his wife with a get.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should I only make one Berachah, or should I make one on each different food?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When I was in \"Pirchei\" boys' youth groups as a child, at snack time I was taught to make a \"Mezonos\" on my cake, \"Shehakol\" on my drink, and \"Haetz\" on my sliced fruit. Then, at the end, the group leader always said \"Al Hamichyah\" for everyone and we all said \"Borei Nefashos\" together.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years I've learned more and more, of course, and I've studied the laws of Berachoth and tried to apply them to my eating habits. But mostly I've followed this pattern except when I've eaten bread, in which case I've assumed (again, as I was taught as a child) that the bread exempts everything. For a few years I even made separate Berachoth on salad that had prominent pieces of food items of different varieties (ramen noodles would get Mezonoth; olives or cranberries would get Ha'Etz; lettuce and tomatoes, etc., would get HaAdamah; and if there was cheese or chicken pieces, they'd get SheHakol). I've since abandoned this and say HaAdamah on the entire salad - and I don't like ramen noodles anyway, so that's moot; ah, but croutons...</p>\n\n<p>Now, of course, I've left out certain special Berachoth and certain \"exception\" cases, but is the way I was taught as a young child more or less the correct way? I continue to be baffled by the Halachoth that seem to contradict this, and unless the Halachoth are actually as muddled as they seem to be and have exception upon exception upon exception, I can't help but think that I was taught incorrectly (perhaps as a way of ensuring we all made and learned our Berachoth, we said <em>everything</em>?), and in my efforts to do it right I've ignored what I've learned later and stuck to what I was taught as a young child as the rule, and assumed everything else was the exception.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: <strong>Should I just choose one food as the 'Ikar and exempt all the others?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, you should make a separate beracha on each food.  In fact, there are even halachos of what order you should make the separate berachos in.  These halachos can be found in S.A. O.C. 211.  It is implicit in these halachos that you make more than one beracha if you have foods which require different berachos, and the only discussion is the order.  For example, sif 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הביאו לפניו דבר שברכתו בורא פרי העץ ודבר שברכתו שהכל, בורא פרי העץ קודמת שהיא חשובה שאינה פוטרת אלא דבר אחד. וכן בורא פרי האדמה ושהכל, בורא פרי האדמה קודמת. ואם הביאו לפניו פרי העץ ופרי האדמה, איזה מהם שירצה יקדים. ויש אומרים שבורא פרי העץ קודם</p>\n<p>If a person was brought something which gets a \"ha'etz\" and something that gets a \"shehakol,\" the \"ha'etz\" comes first because it is more important, as it is more specific.  And so too with a \"ha'adama\" and a \"shehakol.\"  If a person was brought a \"ha'etz\" and a \"ha'adama,\" he can pick whichever he wants.  And some say the \"ha'etz\" comes before the \"ha'adama.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what you learned as a youngster is indeed correct.</p>\n\n\n",

In my current Shul, the prayer for the U.S. is also recited at the same interval and everyone stands throughout.  But in the Shul I attended my entire childhood through adolescence, all of these were recited by the rabbi while the Torah was on the Bimah, immediately following the MiSheBerach(s) for the sick.</p>\n\n<p>It is almost universal (with one notable exception that I can think of) that nobody is asked to stand, and that nobody specifically rises, for the MiSheBerachs for the sick.  Hence, in my childhood Shul, nobody rose for any of these Tefilloth.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it so commonly accepted that one must rise for the former but not for the latter type of communal Tefillah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Asking the congregation to stand for prayer X accomplishes two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It highlights that we believe in saying prayer X, and the value of X.

Customs develop organically, without a conscious \"Authorized Halakhic Rationale\" serving as the reason why they should be enacted.   They just develop - for sociological, or impromptu, or it-just-feels-right-and-makes-spiritual-sense reasibs - and if they organically catch on, well, then its a custom!</p>\n\n<p>We can certainly guess as to the sociological reasons why standing for these mishebareich's developed and spread (way of expressing these prayers' particular spiritual importance in the lives of the congregation). But we would BE NAIVE to assume that one day someone got up and said: \"For this particular reason and that particular reason we should now start doing X.\" </p>\n\n<p>The same can be said for standing/sitting for kaddish, or answering Amen vs/ Brich Hu, or standing up during the end of Tachanun. Unless you have good reason to think that early on someone got up and gave a guiding reason, the minhag probably just developed organically.</p>\n\n<p>After the fact, we can and should \"read\" these customs for the values they express. After all, these customs express the holy \"Intuition of the Masses\" of the Jewish people.  No one got up and gave an explicit reason to start things off, but the community as a whole were attracted to some grammatical/spiritual/liturgical/halakhic truth which made them - as an organic mass - develop a given practice.  </p>\n\n<p>So too with standing/sitting for MiSheBareich's.  Without any direct Halakhic order from above, the Jewish people are organically sensing certain liturgical/spiritual truths which make standing up obvious and appropriate for at some times, and less necessary at other times.  If the custom really spreads and solidifies, then in a few centuries, expect Rabbis to look back and try to \"read\" these customs for the values they express.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does the tree of life work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There were two special trees in Gan Eden.  In the case of the tree of knowledge of good and bad, we know that eating from it once produced a permanent effect.  Was this true for the tree of life too, or was that more like a \"maintenance\" tree that you had to keep eating from to live forever?</p>\n\n<p>The reason I ask is that initially Adam and Chava were permitted to eat from that tree.  Once they ate from the other, they were prevented from doing so.  So either eating from the tree of life would also produce a permanent effect and it's just \"luck\" (as if there's any such thing in torah) that they didn't, or that tree works differently, like regular food where eating produces a temporary effect and eventually you need more.  (Or, I suppose, that it produces a permanent effect that is cancelled by eating from the other tree.)</p>\n\n<p>I searched this site and reviewed Rashi on B'reishit and my go-to source for English-language midrash, <em>Sefer Ha-Aggadah</em>, all without luck.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Zichron Yitzchok brings a dispute between those who hold that Odom was supposed originally to live forever (Shabbos 55b, Koheles Rabboh on Bereishis 3:18) but because of his sin, was condemned to die and those who hold that it is impossible to live forever (Ibn Ezra and others) and the punishment for eating the forbidden fruit must mean that he was condemned to die before his time.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the first opinion maintains that eating from the Tree of Life would allow Odom to regain his original state of immortality whilst the second opinion maintains that eating from that Tree would restore Odom's original longevity.   </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban gives a full explanation on pesukim 2:17 and 3:22 where Hashem says that after Odom had eaten from the Tree of Knowledge he could now eat from the Tree of Life and live forever. Ramban explains that originally, man did not have any inclination to do anything that his nature did not require him to do i.e. he would only do as he was commanded to do. Since he had no need to prolong his life he had no reason to eat from The Tree of Life. Once he had eaten from the Tree of Knowledge however, he had the motivation to eat from the Tree of Life (to regain his longevity or immortality) and he also had the capacity to defy Hashem's wishes to by succumbing to physical desire.</p>\n\n<p>(The Ramban's own opinion seems to be clear where he says on (posuk 2:9) 'The Tree of Life is a tree whose fruit grants long life to whoever eats of it'.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is addressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

But was it not permitted to him  – \"from all the trees of the garden you may eat\"?</p>\n<p>We could answer that the Tree of Life is a remedy to the Tree of Knowledge, and the remedy helps the sick person to be healed but not to protect him from getting sick [in the first place]. This is analogous to someone who drinks poison – if they give him balm to drink he will be healed, but if they give him balm to drink first and then they give him poison to drink he will die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Certificate of Divorce by God to Israel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I find the following verse to be very harsh as it gives a pink slip of Divorce to Israel and Judah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1103.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeremiah 3:8</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וָאֵרֶא, כִּי עַל-כָּל-אֹדוֹת אֲשֶׁר נִאֲפָה מְשֻׁבָה יִשְׂרָאֵל, שִׁלַּחְתִּיהָ, וָאֶתֵּן אֶת-סֵפֶר כְּרִיתֻתֶיהָ אֵלֶיהָ; וְלֹא יָרְאָה בֹּגֵדָה יְהוּדָה, אֲחוֹתָהּ--וַתֵּלֶךְ, וַתִּזֶן גַּם-הִיא.‏<br>\n  And I saw, when, forasmuch as backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, that yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are the ramifications of the first verse? Has God divorced the Bnei Yisrael?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The following is a verse from Isaiah (50:1) which helps us in our understanding this verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה, אֵי זֶה סֵפֶר כְּרִיתוּת אִמְּכֶם אֲשֶׁר שִׁלַּחְתִּיהָ, אוֹ מִי מִנּוֹשַׁי, אֲשֶׁר-מָכַרְתִּי אֶתְכֶם לוֹ; הֵן בַּעֲו‍ֹנֹתֵיכֶם נִמְכַּרְתֶּם, וּבְפִשְׁעֵיכֶם שֻׁלְּחָה אִמְּכֶם.</p>\n<p><em>Thus says God: Where is the the bill of your mother's divorce with which I sent her? Or whom of my creditors have I sold you to? Behold, for your inequities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does this mean? First Isaiah makes it sound like there is no divorce (<em>\"where is the bill of divorce?\"</em>), then makes it sound like there is (<em>\"for your transgressions your mother was sent away\"</em>). Is there or is there not a bill of divorce? The way many of the Jewish commentators understand this is that there is no <em>permanent</em> bill of divorce, but rather one that is dependent on certain conditions. \"<em><strong>For your transgressions</strong></em> <em>your mother was sent away\"</em>, implying that when the transgressions cease, the divorce will be revoked.</p>\n<p>Now, what about Jeremiah? Why doesn't he specify something like this. Jeremiah implies that there is a permanent bill of divorce that was given. Many say Isaiah was referring to the Kingdom of Judah (as he prophesied primarily about Judah; see Isaiah 1:1), while Jeremiah was referring to the already-banished Kingdom of Israel (as is clear in the context of the verses). Israel was driven out of their land, perhaps never to come back. Judah was to be exiled, but destined to return less than a century later. (Although many maintain that Israel too will one day return in the final redemption, it is not uncommon for prophets to refer to indefinitely long periods of time as \"forever\".) [Alternatively, God has permanently divorced Israel <em>as a kingdom</em>, in the sense that even when they do eventually return, they will be joined with the Kingdom of Judah, and under Judaic (Davidic) leadership.] (See Radak to Isaiah 50:1.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>God takes the children of Israel back. No other nation replaces them:\n<a href=\"http://ohr.edu/tw/5756/devarim/haazinu.tw\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ohr.edu/tw/5756/devarim/haazinu.tw</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In times to come, when Israel is redeemed from among the nations and \n  Hashem gathers us to Him, Israel will say \"Master of the Universe,\n  it's  written in Your Torah that when a man divorces his wife and\n  banishes her from  his life, should the woman marry again and then\n  divorce this second husband,  she may never again return to her first\n  husband.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"You banished us to amongst the nations of the world.  How is it \n  possible for You to take us back?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Hashem will say to them \"It says in the laws of divorce: When a man\n  will  banish her from his house'. I am G-d, not man.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>These words from the Medrash are most perplexing.  The relationship \n  between the Jewish People and Hashem is understood to be that of a\n  marriage,  of husband and wife. How can it possibly be that about this\n  very subject  Hashem would say \"I am G-d, not man!\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Let us understand the Medrash thus:  The Talmud teaches  us that if a \n  man throws a get, a bill of divorce, to his wife while she is in his\n  yard, the  divorce is not effective.  For a get to work, it needs to\n  be given.  And since  his wife is still in his yard, in his domain,\n  there is a deficiency in the  giving.  It is as though the get never\n  left the orbit of his influence.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, with this principle in mind, we can understand what Hashem is \n  saying: \"I am G-d, not man.  The universe is Mine. The whole world is\n  `My  yard.' Thus I never really gave you a bill of divorce.  I never\n  really  divorced you at all...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Chanukas Hatorah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The verse separates clearly between Israel and Judah -- the standard language referring to the Northern and Southern (Davidic) kingdoms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Israel</strong> had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement</li>\n<li>that yet treacherous <strong>Judah</strong> her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So it seems Israel ends up with a divorce (exile of the Northern kingdom had no return and they vanished there eventually) but Judah \"feared not\", and \"played the harlot\" but the verse speaks nothing of a permanent divorce...</p>\n\n\n",

No formal instruction in secular courses such as mathematics, Greek, or GYMNASTICS, was included in the Jewish school curriculum in this period. Initially, the houses of study excluded children from the lower strata of society, but by the third century education was made available to children of all classes. <strong>Girls were, by and large, excluded from the elementary schools, however, though some Talmudic sources suggest that fathers taught their daughters informally.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's this final portion (emphasis supplied) that I'm most interested in learning about.

The Mishnah states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותורם את תרומתו ומעשרותיו לדעתו ומקריב עליו קיני זבין קיני זבות קיני\n  יולדות חטאות ואשמות ומלמדו מדרש הלכות ואגדות אבל לא ילמדנו מקרא אבל\n  מלמד הוא את בניו ואת בנותיו מקרא</p>\n  \n  <p>MISHNAH. AND HE MAY SEPARATE HIS TERUMAH AND HIS TITHES WITH HIS\n  CONSENT.

HE MAY TEACH HIM MIDRASH, HALACHOTH\n  AND AGGADOTH, BUT NOT SCRIPTURE. YET HE MAY TEACH SCRIPTURE TO HIS\n  SONS AND DAUGHTERS. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/nedarim/nedarim_35.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>; capitals in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This indicates that it was allowed, and perhaps even normal, to teach girls (at least Scripture if nothing else). However, the text of the Mishnah in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides</a>'s version does not contain the words \"ואת בנותיו\" \"and his daughters\". The words are similarly absent in <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/ms50/ms50-103v.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this early manuscript</a>.\nEven if the words were not part of the Mishnah, though, the subsequent Talmudic analysis of this Mishnah assumes that girls were included.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is a Talmudic source that explicitly mentions the education of a specific woman, and even holds her as a standard for male scholars. In Pesachim (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=62b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">62b</a>) we find:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' שמלאי אתא לקמיה דרבי יוחנן א\"ל ניתני לי מר ספר יוחסין א\"ל מהיכן את\n  א\"ל מלוד והיכן מותבך בנהרדעא א\"ל אין נידונין לא ללודים ולא לנהרדעים\n  וכל שכן דאת מלוד ומותבך בנהרדעא כפייה וארצי א\"ל ניתנייה בג' ירחי שקל\n  קלא פתק ביה א\"ל ומה ברוריה דביתהו דר\"מ ברתיה דר\"ח בן תרדיון דתניא תלת\n  מאה שמעתתא ביומא מג' מאה רבוותא ואפ\"ה לא יצתה ידי חובתה בתלת שנין ואת\n  אמרת בתלתא ירחי</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Simlai came before R. Johanan [and] requested him, Let the Master\n  teach me the Book of Genealogies. Said he to him, Whence are you? — He\n  replied, From Lod. And where is your dwelling? In Nehardea. Said he to\n  him, We do not discuss it either with the Lodians or with the\n  Nehardeans, and how much more so with you, who are from Lod and live\n  in Nehardea! But he urged him, and he consented, Let us learn it in\n  three months, he proposed. [Thereupon] he took a clod and threw it at\n  him, saying, If Beruriah, wife of R. Meir [and] daughter of R. Hanina\n  b. Teradion, who studied three hundred laws from three hundred\n  teachers in [one] day, could nevertheless not do her duty in three\n  years, yet you propose [to do it] in three months! (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Pesachim.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino\n  translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While it is certainly possible, even likely, that Beruriah was the exception rather than the rule, it does at least indicate that unique women could be given an education.</p>\n\n<p>The debate about women's education is still ongoing, with some streams of Judaism offering girls almost no formal (textual) Torah education, others teaching girls the same way they teach boys, and many gradations in between. As the question here seems to be about education during the Talmudic Era, the post-Talmudic sources would seem to be largely irrelevant.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>To summarize:</h2>\n\n<p>There is not a tremendous amount of historical material in the Talmudic Era literature. We do see that the consensus was that women are exempt from Torah education, with a dispute as to whether they should be taught anyway. It appears that some amount of Torah education was considered lawful, and perhaps even normal, and individual women may have been heavily educated.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I subsequently found that a footnote in the Soncino translation of one of the above cited sources (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/nedarim/nedarim_35.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 35b note 4</a>) makes almost all the points in my answer with the same citations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From this we see that it was usual to teach the Bible to girls, in\n  spite of the Talmudic deduction that daughters need not be educated\n  (Kid. 30a). The opposition of R.

[V. Maim. Yad. Talmud\n  Torah, I, 13.] Yet even in respect of this, his view was not\n  universally accepted, and Ben ‘Azzai (a.l.) regarded it as a positive\n  duty to teach Torah to one's daughters. The context shows that the\n  reference is to the higher knowledge of Biblical law. In point of\n  fact, there were learned women in Talmudic times e.g., Beruriah, wife\n  of R.

Every other discipline in the world is taught in such a way as to make it as easy as possible to understand. If you learn mathematics for example, they first teach you addition then subtraction. Once you master that, you go on to multiplication, division, algebra, geometry, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There is a clear order, building up from simple to complex and it's written in such a way as to be as easy as possible to understand. On the other hand, the talmud is written in a seemingly chaotic fashion. The very first mishna says:</p>\n\n<p>\"when do we read the shema?.. When the Kohanim enter to eat their teruma...\"</p>\n\n<p>Who? What? What Kohanim? What shema?! First tell me about the source of the mitzva of shema. Where does it come from. What is it? Instead the mishna jumps right in with a confusing mix of information. furthermore the talmud is constantly going off on tangents many of which are totally unrelated to the current tractate.</p>\n\n<p>why is it written like this?</p>\n\n<p>for example, If I want to teach physics in a clear way, I'd start with newton's laws of motion and then after a semester when this is fully clear I'd move up to waves and other more complicated stuff, then maybe optics or electromagnetism then thermodynamics,etc then quantum theory. (and even within newton's laws, I would start from basic and move up to complex). I would not  start with newton's laws then throw in  some electro-magnetism stuff and a little quantum mechanics all at once as this would totaly confuse every one. One must start with ONE most fundamental subject and explain it fully then move on to another subject which builds on that.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the Oral Law had been left as oral teachings for quite some time, until the Mishnah began to put things down.</p>\n\n<p>At the time the Mishnah was written, an average Jew would have been raised knowing that he recites Shema twice daily, and he would have seen Kohanim waiting till nightfall to consume <em>terumah</em>. So the Mishnah is filling us in on the nitty-gritty that we may not have known just from observing normal practice, assuming we have some background.</p>\n\n<p>It's also been suggested that part of the goal was to keep a great deal of the Oral Law oral, hence the Mishnah is just some rough notes.

Besides this, you will have been actively engaged in learning about the practical aspects of the commandments from the age of three on.  In other words, it's not a first year class.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that it's important to take into consideration the manner in which the Talmud was composed. It has never been a secret that the authors of the Talmud were many and various, ranging over a period of some three centuries and spanning an area that ranged from Palestine in the West to Babylonia in the East. It is, in essence, a commentary upon a similarly authored compilation (the Mishna having been composed by multiple individuals over a period of a century at a minimum), and one which incorporates other teachings - both those that are anonymously authored and those that were attributed, however correctly or incorrectly, to specific individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The compilation of the Talmud involved stitching these different texts together on the basis of theme and content, sometimes coupling a section with another because they share a keyword or because they both refer to the same sage. The \"stitching\" comprises those anonymous portions that were written last of all, which link each sugya to its surrounding content and which provide a narratorial voice that questions and analyses the authenticity of traditions. As a piece of literature, this is already vastly different to other examples of human creativity, and cannot properly be compared to them.</p>\n\n<p>When somebody wishes to learn mathematics, the teacher will begin with the most basic information and will increase in complexity as the student's skills develop. Likewise, if somebody wishes to learn halakha, (s)he will start with basic material and only approach the more difficult material once that has been mastered. Under no circumstances would somebody start with the Talmud if their intentions are to know the halakha. They start with the Talmud if their intentions are to know the Talmud, which is a field of study in and of itself.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that it's true that Hebrew had an original havara (pronunciation) that all the modern havarot evolved from, but any havara which is used by a community is called \"leshon hakodesh\" for halachic purposes. His proof is from the fact that Ashkenazim hold by Halitzot performed by Sefardim and vice versa, despite the fact that the halacha requires the one performing Halitzah to be able to say the associated text in leshon hakodesh. He doesn't deal with the Shema explicitly, but it's implied that if a person pronounces it correctly according to <em>his own</em> havara, then <em>for him</em> that would be called pronouncing the Shema correctly. (There are other responsa that deal with the Shema explicitly, e.g. Rav Bentzion Uziel in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1288&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shu\"t Mishpetei Uziel OC 1</a>.)

The identity of the\n  constellation Kesil with our Orion is further attested by the\n  tradition of the ancient versions: of the LXX in Job xxxviii. 31, and\n  of the Vulgate in Job ix. 9 and Amos v. 8. Similarly the Peshitta in\n  Job ix. 9 and xxxviii. 31 gives gabbara ('a strong man'), which is the\n  Syriac name for Orion, closely related to the Arabic gebbar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And also the <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11767-orion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Encyclopaedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ORION (...): The Aramaic and Syriac names of Orion have been connected\n  with the ancient Oriental tradition that Nimrod, who is called in the\n  Bible a hero and mighty hunter, was fettered by God for his obstinacy\n  in building the tower of Babel, and was set in the sky (Winer, \"B. R.\"\n  ii. 157). It is possible that the ancient Hebrews saw in this\n  constellation the figure of a man who was naturally regarded as\n  extraordinarily tall and strong, exactly as the Greeks named it\n  \"Orion,\" the Egyptians \"Sahu,\" and the ancient Hindus \"Triçanka\" (Schiaparelli, l.c.). The Targum to Job xxxviii. 31 speaks of the \"bands which lead Orion.\" The Babylonian scribe and physician Samuel (d. 257), who was celebrated also as an astronomer, said: \"If a comet should pass over Orion the world would perish\" (Bab. Ber. 58b; Yer. Ber. 13c), and in the same passage of the Babylonian Talmud further declares that \"if it were not for the heat of Orion, the world could not exist on account of the cold of the Pleiades, and if it were not for the cold of the Pleiades, the world could not exist on account of the heat of Orion.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a depiction of Orion as stated above, you may check <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orion_constellation_with_star_labels.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orion_constellation_Hevelius.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one </a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pleiades</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Referring to \"Can you tie the chains of the Pleiades\" Schiaparelli notes that the LXX, Aquila and the Vulgate render it this way from <em>maanadot</em> for chains, though the Masoretic text has מַעֲדַנּוֹת which means <em>softening</em> and <em>gladdening influences</em> (of spring-time) or simply <em>delicate/beautiful</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here \"the chains of Kimah\" (Job xxxviii. 31) must be understood in a\n  metaphorical sense. And if that is so, it can refer to no other\n  cluster than that of the Pleiades, which is the best known of these\n  clusters and also the only one which has in consequence of its\n  conspicuous light awakened universal attention at every time and among\n  all peoples. This inference, which would not perhaps have much force\n  in itself, is fortunately confirmed by the tradition of the LXX, where\n  kimah, keeping the singular number, is always the Pleiad. In this case\n  there is further to be added the authority, by no means a despicable\n  one, of Aquila of Pontus, who in Job xxxviii. 31 also translates by\n  <em>the Pleiad</em> (Schiaparelli, <em>ibid</em>, p. 62).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n\n\n",

For example we have lots of things the Hillel said (he lived around then), but they were not written down then - they were written down later. So do they count? They are certainly commentary, but they were only written down later. The Talmud is full of things that were said back then, but they are not collected into a single text with a date from around then. (i.e. the Targumim that Double AA mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly things written down then became the source material of today. Maybe in those days (well, much earlier actually) things like Proverbs and Psalms were considered commentary, but today they would be considered source material. So again, do they count for your question?</p>\n\n<p>Here is a chart: <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/About_Jewish_Texts/Jewish_Texts/Timeline.shtml\">http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/About_Jewish_Texts/Jewish_Texts/Timeline.shtml</a> of complete works with a date. (The formatting is terrible, the last column is only partially visible, and note that it includes some works that are not considered authoritative today, i.e. Apocrypha.)</p>\n\n<p>The rarity of complete works from that early is part of the reason we consider the complete works we do have to be source material and not commentary. (People certainly told stories orally, and some short things were written down, but very little book length material exists from back then - which is why the Torah has such a special place in history.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The same question, roughly, was asked of Rav Sherira Hagaon (ca 900-1000, Babylonia), one of the last heads of the Pumbedisa Yeshiva, the school of rabbinic scholarship which had existed in Babylon from after the destruction of the First Temple until the 11th Century of the Common Era.  In his <a href=\"http://www.mysefer.com/product.asp?cookiecheck=yes&P_ID=2560&strPageHistory=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iggeres</a> (although the term Iggeres means a \"letter\" it is much longer) he traces the history of rabbinic knowledge and scholarship from the giving of the Torah, written and oral, to Moses, the transmission to Aaron, Joshua and the Elders, the Judges, Prophets, the Zugim -- the joint leaders of the Academy and Beis Din (courts) in Jerusalem -- and then to the rabbis of the late 2nd Temple generation.  In those years, he explains, the written and oral law, including interpretations of the Written Torah, were passed down orally from generation to generation and, because students stayed close to their teachers, the chain of tradition was neither forgotten nor confused. Hillel and Shammai, who were the zuggim from the generation just before the beginning of the common era, were known to personally disagree on only three issues.  However, in the subsequent generations, the capability of the rabbis to orally transmit the traditions radically changed with the brutal Roman occupation, especially following the destruction of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple, and the dispersion of the rabbis to Yavneh, Tiberius, and other places.  Thereafter, although there was broad agreement on most general points, on specific laws and customs there were often disputes because somewhere there had been an error in transmission.  Rav Sheriera explains that these errors were caused because the occupation led to students not being able to fully devote themselves to their teachers, and the inability to check with colleagues to assure that one rabbi taught Torah in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>By the second century of the Common Era, there had come to be some agreement that the oral Torah could not continue to be conveyed exclusively by oral means, but had to be written down.  Almost simultaneously Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (\"Rebbe\") and Rabbi Chiyah wrote down what they knew of the memorized rabbinic teachings in what became known as the Mishna and the Tosefta, respectively.  Individual teachings from the Tosefta are frequently referred to in the Talmud as B'raisas.  After the publication of the Mishna, scholars in Israel and Babylonia continued to study Rebbe's and Rabbi Chiyah's versions of the mishnayos attempted to reconcile seemingly conflicting teachings.  After several generations of these discussions, the Israeli contingent of teachers preserved their studies in a collection of books now known as the Jerusalem Talmud (ca 4th century), and the Babylonian Talmud (ca late 7th century).</p>\n\n<p>In summary, we have no writings of commentaries before the 1st century of the Commen Era because the rabbis at that time believed that writing down the oral teachings G-d gave to Moses to be forbidden and unnecessary.  But during Roman rule, writing down the Oral law became a necessity.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Traditions contained in Josephus' biblical commentary, see <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=S349d-yRgCIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=oNu11fS_kgoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book</a>.

Kohanic status is strictly patrilineal.</p>\n\n<p>The one exception is that if your first child was a boy, even if born naturally (i.e. not C-section), he would <em>not</em> require a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidyon_haben\">Pidyon HaBen ceremony</a>; as the Torah speaks of \"first issue of the mother's womb\", a Pidyon is only required if both mom and dad are non-Kohens.</p>\n\n<p>Your kids are totally non-Kohens, though, and if one of them marries another non-Kohen, their firstborn male child <em>would</em> need a Pidyon HaBen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Bechoros 47a) states that if a non-Jew fathers a child with a Jew, the paternal relationship is not recognized from the perspective of the halacha.  The child is viewed, in a manner of speaking, as if he were a product of parthenogenesis, as he has a legal mother but no legal father.  That being the case, we have an extremely peculiar application: If a non-Levite Jew fathers a child with a daughter of a Levite, the child is given his father's affiliation, that of a non-Levite.  If, on the other hand, a non-Jew fathered a child with a daughter of a Levi, the child would be a Levite.  </p>\n\n<p>This would not apply to the daughter of a kohen, because illicit intercourse would annul her kohanic status and therefore that of her child.  If, however, the child was the product of in-vitro fertilization, then there are two possibilities.<br>\n1. If the donor was a non-Jew, then the donor is not recognized in halacha, leaving the child the mother's identity, her kedusha being intact, unlike the Gemara's example which involved illicit intercourse.<br>\n2. If the donor was a Jew, then there are two more possibilities.  Some view the donor as the legal father, and therefore the child would not be a Kohen.  Others do not accept the legal paternity of the donor, and therefore this would be a case of legal mother/no legal father, where we would apply the Gemara's rule of default matrilineal identity.</p>\n\n\n",

No problem. But how can he be, or why is he, called a <em>sinner</em> (\"the rebels and those who deliberately sin against me\") based on the intercourse of which he's a product? He hasn't sinned.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It would seem that the description of such a child as “rebellious” and “transgressor” is not in reference to the <em>parents'</em> wrongful conduct at the time of intercourse, but rather to the <em>child's own</em> predisposition to future sin as a result of this. The Zohar (See Zohar II, 204b; III, 80-82, explained in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#footnoteRef24a7881\" rel=\"nofollow\">end of the 2nd chapter of Tanya</a>) writes that during intercourse, the soul of the child is drawn down, and that pure thoughts and intentions at this moment are essential in bringing down a pure and holy soul. Therefore, improper conduct at this time can result in a child who is more prone to sin.</p>\n\n<p>[Incidentally, the Beis Yosef (OC 340) quotes the opinion of the Ravaad who renders “בני” as “people who”, and understands it as referring to the parents and not the child. As for your proof against this, I would suggest that he understands that if R' Yonosan has such positive things to say about the children of such a union, he would not consider the parents to be sinners.]</p>\n\n\n",

But if the door-frame was first broken and then walled up, so that no aperture at all is visible, the house is regarded as a grave and defiles everything around it to a distance of four cubits. — Thus an opening must be absolutely closed before it ceases to count as such, and the same applies to the cask.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Otherwise, Group X will continue to view the potential convert as a gentile with all that entails.</p>\n\n<p>So if she wants the most groups to recognize the conversion, she would have to have it performed by individuals with the most requirements, which in this case is broadly speaking the Orthodox movement. If she chooses not to take that path, she should know that most if not all Orthodox congregations will continue to view her, and through matrilineal descent, her children as complete gentiles. There isn't anything wrong with that <em>per se</em>, it's just a consequence she ought to be aware of.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I'm going to more or less echo Kordovero and Double AA, but put it succinctly.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there is a difference, <strong>and it will matter</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>If a person converts by any standard that is not universally recognized, then that person <strong>will not be regarded as Jewish</strong> by those with stricter standards.</p>\n\n<p>Orthodox conversion requires more than Conservative or Reform conversion. It's a simple matter of fact. Israel (so far) only recognizes Orthodox conversion, and only those performed by Orthodox rabbis on a pre-approved list. An unrecognized conversion will significantly impact one's ability to move there, and it may, in fact, make it impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, if a person converts under Reform or Conservative auspices, an Orthodox conversion would be required later if that person were to decide to join an Orthodox congregation or to move to Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, for a woman in particular, if her conversion is not recognized, <strong>her children will not be regarded as Jewish, either</strong>. If there is any desire to enroll the children in a Jewish day school or any inkling that the convert may want her children (or recognition that <em>her children may one day decide</em>) to join an Orthodox community, having a mother who underwent a Conservative or Reform conversion will pose a problem for them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Conversion to any religion is a personal decision, and I believe the decision to convert should not be made for economic or social reasons.  While it is true that Orthodox conversion smooths over a lot of issues related to living in Israel, not all Orthodox conversions are accepted by the Orthodox rabbinate there.  They, too, are concerned about the motivation of the convert, and would not be impressed by someone who converted Orthodox thinking only about whether converting one way has more advantage over another.</p>\n<p>I converted first with the Conservative movement, and then, two years later, \"upgraded\" to Orthodox having decided the year before that my Conservative conversion probably wasn't valid.</p>\n<p>I believe that a decision to convert through a particular denomination must be made on the movement's spiritual values.  I considered the following:</p>\n<p>I visited Reform and Conservative shuls and was active in a Conservative shul.  But since I rejected Christianity for its lack of authenticity with respect to the Bible, I found that only Orthodoxy had the authenticity I desired.  As I wrote in a 1980 article (see my profile which has a link to my conversion story), I was impressed that Orthodoxy did not pick and choose from the commandments in the Torah.</p>\n<p>I was also put off with the practice of some Conservative Jews that I knew of, to celebrate Shabbos by going out to a non-Kosher restaurant before running to the Temple's 7:30 Friday night service, rather than being with family at home, learning Torah with your children, praying to G-d at home and in the synagogue, and having 25 hours away from the computer, phones, work, etc.  As the new Israeli Knesset member, Dr. Ruth Calderon, said about the lack of study of Jewish texts, no one took away our Jewish heritage, people willingly gave it up.</p>\n<p>If you want a reason that is somewhat objective, consider that a recent <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/WillYourGrandchildrenBeJews/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">demographic study</a> by Antony Gordon and Richard Horowitz showed that 100 Orthodox Jews will have 434 Jewish great-grandchildren; 100 Conservative will have 29 Jewish great grandchildren; and 100 Reform Jews will only have 10 Jewish great-grandchildren.  If the religion is important enough for you to convert, Jewish continuity should be important, too.</p>\n<p>One might argue that Orthodoxy is behind the times on women's and gay rights.  On the first point I would suggest more study.  On gay rights, that will really come down to how you perceive the divinity of the Bible.</p>\n<p>No one can tell you which way to convert.  You have to look into your heart.  For me, after I understood the differences, there was no choice.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why doesn't \"This is the bread of our affliction\" answer one of the Mah Nishtana?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the questions (examples?) in the Mah Nishtana is why on all other nights we eat leavened bread or matzah and tonight (Passover) we only eat matzah. However in the introduction to the seder we state \"This is the bread of our affliction...\" which would seem to explain why we are eating matzah. Since this introduction is said before the Mah Nishtana how do we understand the question regarding eating matzah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Firstly, it should be noted that the text of Mah Nishtana predates that of “Hei Lachma Anya”. Ma Nishtana was around in the time of the Beis Hamikdosh (see Pesachim 116a), whereas according to most opinions “Hei Lachma Anya” was established during the exile in Bavel, as is evident from the fact it was written in Aramaic (Machzor Vitri, Ravya Siman 525, Rashbatz in Yavin Shemu’a 49:3). Therefore, the question is really not on the Mah Nishtana, but rather on the placement of “Hei Lachma Anya” beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>The Hagadah “Siach Yitzchok” (Hagr”i Milatzan, page 7 – quoted in HaSeder Haaruch vol. 2 pg. 124 footnote 6) asks this question, and suggests that due to the concern that the children might fall asleep before “Mah Nishtana”, and will miss out hearing the story of the Exodus from Egypt, they placed an abridged version of the story at the very beginning of the Seder, in “Hei Lachma Anya”. However, this is very difficult to fathom for several reasons: 1) Mah Nishtana is the very next paragraph, and we then immediately answer by saying “Avadim Hayinu”. If we were concerned the children might fall asleep, we could should have placed it at the begining of the Seder, not minutes before we answer the questions! 2) “Hei Lachma Anya” does not even mention that we were slaves in Egypt and came out, just the food we ate there. (I did not see the actual Hagada, just what was quoted in “Haseder Haaruch”, so it is possible he addresses these concerns).</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, several Rishonim (Machzor Vitri, Rashbatz in Yavin Shemu’a 49:3) explain that “Hei Lachma Anya” was actually placed before Mah Nishtana in order to let the children know that we will only be eating Matza tonight, and they will be aroused to ask the Mah Nishtana. This too is hard to understand, as a general question can be asked on the rest of Mah Nishtana – how do the children know we are going to eat Maror, dip it in Charoses, or that we will only be eating leaning? If they deduce it from the contents of the Seder plate, why is Matza any different?</p>\n\n<p>Others explain (HaSeder Haruch vol 3. Page 119) that paragraph only serves to answer why we just broke the Matza in half (it is “bread of affliction”, and we are like poor people who hide some of their food for later), but not the main question of why eat Matzah. However this does not fit with the fact that in most Haggadas this passage comes after the symbol for “Maggid” (see the Rambam’s Nusach Hahagah for example).</p>\n\n<p>The question can be answered through a deeper understanding of what exactly “Hei Lachma Anya” means. There are several strong questions on this paragraph:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why now, at the fifth step of the Seder, do we suddenly extend an invitation for all poor people to join us? Surely this offer should have been conveyed at the start of the meal, or even in Shul before we came home?</p></li>\n<li><p>The passage seems quite disjointed; what exactly is the connection between the beginning, middle and end of the paragraph? We begin by explaining why we eat Matza, and then suddenly change tracks and announce that anyone hungry can come over, and finally state that this is the final year of Exile and next year will be return to the land of Israel.</p></li>\n<li><p>“This is the bread of affliction that our ancestors ate in the Land of Egypt.”  Perhaps it commemorates the bread they ate, but it certainly is not the actual bread they ate (3000 year old Matza would be quite stale!) [Some recite an alternative version, כהא לחמא, or הא כלחמא – “this is like the bread”, however the accepted version by is הא לחמא – “This is the bread” – See Shulchan Aruch OC 473:6]</p></li>\n<li><p>Later in the Hagada we give a very different reason for eating Matza: “This Matza that we eat is for what reason? Because the dough of our fathers did not have time to become leavened before the King of Kings, the Holy one blessed be he, revealed Himself to them and redeemed them”. However, here we state that the Matza was what they ate while they were in Egypt, not what they ate while they were fleeing?</p></li>\n<li><p>Although some commentators suggest that the Jews ate Matza while enslaved in Egypt [the Avudraham writes that when the Ibn Ezra was imprisoned in India he was fed Matza, because it is satisfying in small amounts and is slow to digest, and suggests that similarly in Egypt the Jews were fed Matza. Alternatively the Sforno suggests that the Egyptian slavedrivers did not give the Jews enough free time for their bread to rise, so they were forced to bake Matzah], the Maharal (Gevuros Hashem chapter 51) writes that this claim is not supported by any verse in Torah, Mishna or Gemora. The Hagadas “Baruch She’amar” adds that as is evident from Bamidbar 11:4-5, the Jews in Egypt enjoyed fish and meat, and certainly would have been able to eat real bread.</p></li>\n<li><p>According to Halacha (see Shulchan Aruch Harav 473:14), the mitzvah of relating the story of the Exodus from Egypt should be done in response to the questions the child asks. Why then do we begin chronicling our departure from Egypt before “Mah Nishtana” is asked?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on the above questions, the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Likkutey Sichos vol. 17 pg. 80) concludes that it is clear that something very different is happening in this paragraph, and suggests the following novel and fascinating explanation:</p>\n\n<p>This paragraph is actually a prelude to the story of the Exodus, and is pivotal in order to clarify a troubling problem that we are faced with as we embark in relating the story of the Exodus. As we recount the story of how Hashem took our ancestors out of Egypt, we are bothered by the question: What is this all worth if today we find ourselves in exile again? As we say later in the Hagada, “In every generation they rise against us to destroy us”. The Jews are dispersed across the world, hated by their neighbours and constantly persecuted.  Sure, historically it’s a fascinating story, but practically speaking, what are we celebrating?</p>\n\n<p>We therefore ask – could we possibly say (metaphorically speaking) that our ancestors tasted the “bread” of redemption? This is “bread of affliction”, as the redemption was short-lived and we are back in exile. Just look around and notice that there are starving people who cannot afford the basic needs of a Seder and need to be invited to other homes! We are slaves in exile, what is there to rejoice for tonight?</p>\n\n<p>We answer this question with the closing words of the passage: “Next year we will be in the Land of Israel  ...  next year we will be free people.” To explain, one could ask the question: If Hashem is so perfect, how come He could not have made the redemption from Egypt a complete one, not followed by further suffering? The answer is of course He could, but He wanted it to come from us. Nonetheless, Hashem’s part in the redemption was complete and Yetzias Mitzrayim continues to provide us with the potential to fulfil our part. We are thus commanded to remember the Exodus every day of our life, for this is the Divine source we need to utilize to actualize the finale redemption.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer the question: This paragraph does not contain an explanation for <em>why</em> we eat Matza - that will be addressed later in the Hagadah when we ask \"Matza Zu She'anu Ochlim..\" It's purpose is to explain the relevance of the celebrate of Pesach nowadays. It is therefore understandable why the child asks why we eat Matza in the \"Ma Nishtana\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm going to give a more simplistic answer, which is how I understand the <em>haggada</em> based on the commentary of Abarbanel.</p>\n\n<p>When we say <em>Ha Lachma Anya</em>, we are not referring to the reason why we eat the <em>matza</em>. <em>Lachma Anya</em> is the Aramaic version of <em>Lechem Oni</em>, which is how <em>matza</em> is described in the Torah. But rather than translate that as \"bread of our affliction\", perhaps a better translation would be \"meager bread\", referring to the \"poor\" makeup of the <em>matza</em> and it's meager appearance. We do make a passing reference to the fact that our ancestors ate this bread in Egypt, but we make no mention of <em>why</em> they ate it in Egypt. True, they ate it with the Passover offering before they left, but why? The point of this paragraph is not to address this issue, so we don't get into it until later, when we mention R' Gamliel's statement.</p>\n\n<p>One of the questions of the <em>Mah Nishtana</em> is about the <em>matzah</em>, but notice that we never specifically answer that question until much later. <em>Avadim Hayinu</em> doesn't seem to answer it at all. Truthfully, the point of <em>Mah Nishtana</em> is not to ask about the <em>matzah</em> and <em>marror</em> and other things specifically, but rather to ask about the following: Why do we do some things (like <em>matzah</em> and <em>marror</em>) that imply poverty and slavery, and then other things (like dipping and leaning) that imply freedom and wealth? Why are we being inconsistent? The answer to this is going to be that because we were freed on this night. We started off as slaves and became free men. So we so things to commemorate both. That's all that <em>Avadim Hayinu</em> is coming to say.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this question comes from the perspective of someone who already knows a little about what's going on. We haven't taken out the marror, we've only dipped once, we made only a passing reference to <em>matza</em>. This is not an ignorant child asking. In fact, Abarbanel believes that this question is not necessarily designed for children. We are asking the question ourselves; the question-answer format is part of the traditional setup. It is only over time that the tradition became for the children to say the <em>Mah Nishtana</em> since it is their general roles to be asking questions on this night, just their questions weren't \"canonized\" into the <em>haggada</em>. So it became their \"job\" to recite the <em>Mah Nishtana</em>; but of course we would still recite it regardless if any children are present.</p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question, why would anyone ask the reason for eating <em>matza</em> when we've already said that <em>matza</em> is <em>lachma anya</em>? Well, first, because <em>lachma anya</em> has nothing to do with why we eat <em>matza</em>. And secondly, because the question of <em>Mah Nishtana</em> is not why we eat <em>matza</em>, but why we do things that imply slavery and poverty at all.</p>\n\n\n",

The gap between rabbinic leadership and the lay is being broached with great rapidity. More people are interested in a more horizontal society wherein they approach sources, analyze them, digest them, etc. and interact on such basis rather than a hierarchic top down, approach. Indeed this very group is indicative of such a trend despite the disclaimer softly heard \"but consult your LOR.\" Put this in tangent with those turned off by the standard x,y,z incarnation of local frumkeit but an inclination towards traditionalism then you've got a real magnification of the \"pick and choose\" type Judaism which emerged in the 20th c. through the coalescing of many different Jewish communities from various far flung regions in urban centers. Customs, nushaoth, etc. are readily swapped in and out and between members of the Jewish community in a fashion which would have been impossible 100+ years ago.</p>\n<p>There is also a great proliferation of groups with all kinds of niche interests across the board. Let's say you are into writing fan-fiction for some indie sci-fi film no one has ever heard of from the early 80's... today you can find others online like yourself with the same interest and develop a group, fomenting the development of a subculture which otherwise would have been relegated to isolated individuals operating as islands of ignorance of one another. Not only that, now there is even the opportunity for others with similar interests with the potential for such intrigue to become affiliated and involved too through greater exposure and the sheer presence of a virtual community. The same could be so for such self-styled \"Talmidei HaRaMBaM.\"</p>\n<p>As for why the Rambam as opposed to any other Rishon? Setting aside all of the arguments against the Mishneh Torah that emerged in his own day and in the following centuries, his project was indeed monumental. One thing is that it is the first (and only?) code of halakha to cover the entire range of potential and past praxis based on the rulings of Hazal. On top of which, he does not import local custom into Hazalic legislation nor even Geonic rulings. He may on occasion make reference to them but is always very clear in making such delineations. Such cannot be said of many (perhaps most) other codifications. Indeed it also altogether absent of any Kabbalistic influence - something everyone seems to agree should not infringe upon the autonomy of halakha, yet nevertheless frequently does in other halakhic works of later vintage. Some, such as the students of Hakham Faur in particular take issue with the methods employed by Franco-German Talmudists/Halakhicists and in particular the Baalei Tosafoth (see <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230418234830/http://moreshetsepharad.org/media/-The_Legal_Thinking_of_the_Tosafot_A_Historical_Approach_by_Jose_Faur.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Legal Thinking of the Tosafot: a Historical Approach</a>) and admire the strength of purity of the Andalusian mesorah. This mesora is the one that went up in a very direct line through the Babylonian academies to Rabbenu Hananel, to Rabbenu Alfasi, to R. Yosef Megas to R. Maimon to the Rambam. Indeed in the Rambam's introduction to his commentary on the Mishna he claims that he differs from the Rabbenu Alfasi in no more than 10 places and expresses profound gratitude for his and the R. Megas formative impact upon his approach and rulings. In tangent with having this strong mesorah, he was very much so insistent upon following the truth even when in conflict with pervasive and widespread sentiment. Whereas the methods of other Rishonim (especially Ashkenazic ones) would strongly defend tradition as it stands on the ground and attempt to reconcile to Talmudic legislation the Rambam was almost scientific and modern in his approach to texts. Comparing girsaoth, and willing to overturn Geonic precedent when in conflict with Talmudic legislation. Judaism today has become a kind of a shmoregesboard (whether that is lamentable or great a discussion for another time) and many are gravitating towards such a back to the roots (Meqori) attitude that the Rambam's rulings in the MT represents.</p>\n<p>Your question whilst primarily concerning halakha ought not discount the appeal that the Rambam's work has for hashqafic reasons. The intellectualist \"rationalism\" that he has come to represent and shines through even in the MT in the fist volume, Sefer HaMada. Many find therein a clear articulation of beliefs that resonate as fundamentally traditional yet in conflict with many of the ideas that circulate in frum society today. Those who shy away from the pan-Hasidic orientation that has developed (even in the Litvishe yeshiva velt) and the emphasis on ideas with Kabbalistic origins find an ally in the Rambam.</p>\n<p>As for why \"100% exclusively\" the Rambam, I don't think that there are any who really practice as such - rather the MT is being reclaimed as the primary codex of halakha as opposed to the Shulhan Arukh which supposedly all of Orthodoxy \"holds by.\" Rather than relying primarily on R. Yosef's 2/3 method of determining halakha, an approach that a more meqori oriented individual may find fault with, the general launching base and fallback to is to the MT, which is attractive for the aforementioned reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://talmideiharambam.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmidei HaRaMBaM</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Put quite simply, the Rambam's <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> is not only the most complete, but the most simple and easily understood of codified <em>halakhah</em> ever written.</p>\n\n<p>Although he is often portrayed as an innovator when it comes to codification, this is simply untrue. Rather, he should be properly seen as capstone - the <em>makeh be-faTish</em> as it were - in this endeavor. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rabbenu Hananel</strong> restated the Gemara and included many quotations from other works of Hazal, most notably the <em>Talmudh Yerushalmi</em></li>\n<li><strong>Rav YiSHaq Al-Fasi</strong> (the Rif) - a student of Rabbenu Hananel - in his <em>Halakhoth</em> restated the opinions of the Gemara which he deemed to be the practical <em>halakhah</em>, leaving out all else but including some explanations of the text in places</li>\n<li>The <strong>Geonic codes</strong>, such as the <em>Halakhoth Gedoloth</em> of Shim^on Qayyara and the <em>Halakhoth Pesuqoth</em> of Yehudai Gaon, simply restate the final decisions of the Mishnah and the Gemara with some expansive comments</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The practical problem of all of these codes is that they were either incomplete (i.e. only written on areas of <em>halakhah</em> readily applicable to Diaspora Jewry) or they were written in a mixture of talmudic Aramaic and Arabic - or both. This made them useful as references for scholars but of little use to the general population of religious Jewry who often possessed only a basic education in <em>Humash</em>, <em>Mishnayoth</em>, and their respective dialects of Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the other codes, such as the Rosh and others, were not really \"codes\" at all and were only commentaries on the work of the Rif.</p>\n\n<p>The works of the <em>Tur</em>, <em>Beth Yosef</em>, and the later <em>ShulHan ^Arukh</em>, were more akin to attempts at commentary rather than codification. And even that halakhic material which is codified is often not conclusive, but cites various opinions (i.e. <em>yesh omrim</em>). This, in addition to similar language barriers as the others, likewise makes their works difficult to access and to practically integrate.</p>\n\n<p>In more recent times, the very important and impressive work of <em>halakhah</em> by HaRav YeHiel Mikhel Epshtein z\"l - the <em>^Arokh HaShulHan</em> - was published. Although it is complete in its scope and extremely useful for a deeper and broader understanding of the halakhic discussion underlying any given subject (as well as a <em>liquT</em> of all relevant sources), it too is written in rabbinic Hebrew and in the Aramaic of the sources which it cites. Further, its legal decisions are based in large part on the daily realities of Lithuanian Jewry, making it in many ways inapplicable for other Diaspora communities.</p>\n\n<p>What the Rambam did - and what makes him so unique as to engender a movement in connection to his halakhic code - is as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Complete</em></strong>: The 14 books of the <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> comprise the entirety of <em>halakhah</em> for all ages and epochs of Jewish existence, both inside and outside of <em>Eress Yisra'el</em>.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Accessible</em></strong>: The <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> is written in a largely simple and straightforward dialect of Mishnaic Hebrew and the material is organized in a logical and topical fashion.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Transcends Local and Later Customs</em></strong>: The <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> is a work that usually quotes the relevant <em>Mishnayoth</em> verbatim, translates the relevant passages of the Gemara and then quotes them verbatim, and also includes simple explanations and reasoning based largely on the consensus of the Geonim. Although the Rambam will at times mention the customs of Babylon, Israel, and even those of his own teachers in Spain, his work is virtually bereft of local and later customs developed in the exile. This has a unifying and simplifying effect that is unparalleled and unmatched.</li>\n<li><strong><em>A Rational Approach</em></strong>: This aspect of the <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> has always attracted adherents, however in today's culture of information and a desire for religion that makes sense, it stands alone as an expression of authentic <em>halakhah</em> and ethical teachings that is thoroughly based in reason and practicality, its attraction is all the more so. It lacks mentions of evil spirits, demons, segulas, reincarnation, instructions on the efficacy of amulets, and the like. Rather, it attempts to rid common Jewish practice of such superstitious elements that had crept into Judaism even in the time of the Rambam.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Reaches a Singular, Confident Conclusion</em></strong>: Far from the later trend to try and be careful to respect and fulfill all halakhic opinions [or as many as possible] simultaneously - even rejected opinions from the Mishnah and Gemara themselves - the <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> brings one exclusive and confident conclusion in almost every case it contains.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reason why his work is most popular these days among converts and especially <em>ba^alei</em> <em>teshuvah</em> is because by utilizing their basic knowledge of Hebrew they were exposed to as a child, a good dictionary, and a shorter amount of time than pouring themselves into a Daf Yomi program, they can understand the <em>halakhah</em>. Not only this, but they can master a lot more and without the confusion of the back and forth of the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the vision of the Rambam is beginning to find fruition in our times.

    "content": "# How is it possible for Muslims to be classified as Gentiles even if they Don't deem Torah to be corrupt and have Abrahimic Lineage?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Muslims don't believe Torah to be corrupt nor do they deny the Torah and it is considered in the six articles of faith to believe in all revealed scriptures like Torah, Psalms etc . Also Muslim share a common patriarch Prophet Moses and  believe in all of the subsequent prophets like Israel etc , yet why are Muslims considered to be gentiles?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In Judaism, someone is considered a gentile (or Jew) not based on his beliefs or actions. Being a Jew is having a status that attaches to a person under very specific circumstances; without those circumstances, he's a gentile. Specifically, to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or undergo the process of conversion that is specified in Jewish law. That is why most Muslims are considered gentiles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am not going to discuss whether it Islam thinks that the Torah text was corrupted (though from proffered quotes and discussions about which son of Abe was bound make me wonder) but I am going to answer the question exactly as asked \"why are Muslims considered to be gentiles?\" This is similar but not identical to \"Why aren't Muslims Jewish\"?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is simple, really. Because they aren't Jewish. The word Jew (and therefore, its opposite word, the label for 'not-being') developed significantly after Moses' time -- it had to do with the divided kingdoms and the lineage of most of the people in the kingdom of Judah. When the term became the generalized title for \"people of the Kingdom of Judah\" it excluded people who were not of that kingdom. And when it became used (as it was in the scroll of Esther) to mean \"those who subscribe to the code of religious law of the people of the Kingdom of Judah\" it created the class of \"Gentile\" if not in name then in theory (the word gains its current meaning as a noun in the 14th <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gentile\" rel=\"nofollow\">century</a>. So semantically, the deciding factor is about being a Jew (which can come about by proper conversion or through descent as codified by Jewish law).</p>\n\n<p>So if one asks \"is a Muslim a Jew, because semantically, many Muslims say that every Jew could be considered a Muslim in the broadest sense of the word as submitting to the will of god\" the answer is \"no.\" Being a member of the Jewish religion (and therefore not a gentile) has to do either with descent as defined by Jewish law or conversion as defined by Jewish law. It is not about a personal sense that one can find a link for himself to some historical personage.</p>\n\n<p>Also note (as I have been musing about some of the comments on the Q and A's) -- Jews don't claim Moses as a biological patriarch, nor do we list him as a spiritual patriarch (the forefathers were Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) so finding a shared belief in him as a prophet or a great grandfather doesn't have an effect on one's status as Jewish.</p>\n\n\n",

This is based on non-halachic, Kabbalistic considerations.  This is not because of anything the son may have done, but because the person who passed away may be guilty of certain sins.  In any case, I have never heard of this minhag being followed anywhere outside of Yerushalayim.  Even in Yerushalayim, in the last few years they have become less vehement about this minhag, due to strong protests of families that were shocked to hear that they couldn't go with their parent or grandparent.  But one cannot rely on this; if it is an important consideration, one would be well advised to purchase their plots outside of Har Hamenuchos or Har Hazeisim.\nThe source, I've been told by members of the Chevra Kadisha, is a Zohar in Breishis, involving Adam and Chava and Kayin.

I can't, and I see no need to go digging, since it's not something that pertains for the communities outside of Yerushalayim, and, again, it is another example of Kabbala in opposition of mesora.

At death and burial they come to accompany the dead man, to lament him, and to claim their share of the inheritance; they may also injure the legitimate sons.

It was written in response to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Crusade\">the First Crusade</a> (and is thus said only in the <em>Ashk'nazi</em> rite). Because of its somber topic (or origin), it is omitted on various joyous occasions, though which occasions qualify varies widely. It is also, according to some views (cited in <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 685) and in many synagogues, omitted when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Shabbat#The_Four_Parshiyot\">the \"four <em>parashiyos</em>\"</a> are read.

The custom not to say it is in the Darkei Moshe in the name of the Maharail (Siman 685), and seems to be the custom of the Magen Avraham and R. Yaakov Lorberbaum of Lissa (in his Siddur, Derech Hachayim). However, the Eliyah Rabba (685:18) and Shaarei Efraim there mention the custom to say Av Harachamim even during the 4 parshios. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Aruch Hashulchan (685:9) seems to approve of the custom to omit the prayer, because these Shabbosos have a festive air about them, just like the Shabbos Mevarchim.<sup>1</sup> It sounds like anytime when something special is done regarding the leining, there's a feeling of happiness (because there are more kibbudim to be given out if there's another Sefer Torah, maybe? I'm not sure). </p>\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Emden (Mor Uktziah 685:10) writes that once Adar has entered, \"מרבים בשמחה\", we increase our joy, and don't want to dampen that joy with the somber prayer of Av Harachamim.<sup>2</sup> (Even though there are week(s) in Adar without an extra parsha, I assume that this isn't an issue because the festive nature of the month isn't express in any halacha during that week/weeks)</p>\n\n<p>My understanding has always been that these parshiyos are related to the holidays around which they are centered (Purim and Pesach), and so the season, at least on a Shabbos when that feeling is being expressed by the \"four parshiyos\", should be a joyous one. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> \"ולעניות דעתי נראה שלא לומר כיון שאין מזכירין נשמות והם שבתות של שמחה ולא גריעי משבת שמברכין בו את החודש\"</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> \"במגן אברהם הביא בשם מהרי״ל שבכל ד׳ פרשיות אין מזכירין נשמות… לא נודע לי טעם בפרשת שקלים אבל בפרשת זכור שכבר נכנס אדר שמרבין בשמחה נ״ל שנכון מנהג מהרי״ל וכ״ש בשתי פרשיות שלאחר פורים שהם בין גאולה לגאולה דהוי מנהגא\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=298\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berura 685:18</a> actually brings a dispute as to whether we say Av HaRachamim during the weeks of the 4 Parshios. Minhag Chabad is to say on Parshas Zachor and on Parshas Para מפורש בלוח 'היום-יום' לש\"פ זכור ופרה שאומרים 'אב הרחמים', however do not say it on Parshas Shekalim or HaChodesh since we are either Bentching Rosh Chodesh or it is Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n\n<p>I have yet to see a reason mentioned anywhere for those that do not say it - other than \"we do not say it\". My own thought is perhaps there is increased Simcha in taking out a second Sefer Torah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Those that omit Av Harachamim do so because the Four Parshios are to some extent celebratory, in that they usher in and remind us about the oncoming festival of Pesach.

    "title": "Spitting at the High Priest on Yom Kippur",
    "content": "# Spitting at the High Priest on Yom Kippur\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question might sound a little complicated, but it actually boils down to something very simple: does anybody know of any references to a kohen gadol (a high priest) performing the procedure of <em>chalitzah</em> on Yom Kippur itself? My reasons for thinking that such a thing might be thought to have occurred are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Yevamot 6:4) mentions that if a brother of the kohen gadol should die, leaving no offspring, the kohen gadol should submit to <em>chalitzah</em> rather than <em>yibum</em>. According to Tosafot (Yevamot 61a, s.v. <em>kohen gadol shemet achiv</em>), the reason that the Mishna tells us this is because we might otherwise have thought <em>chalitzah</em> an impermissible degradation of the kohen gadol, given that it necessitates a woman spitting at him. This is also the interpretation of Tosafot Yom-Tov and Tiferet Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Yevamot 9:2) also mentions a variety of situations in which a woman is prohibited to both her husband and her husband's brother. One of those is when she is a widow, her husband is the kohen gadol and her husband's brother is <em>also</em> the kohel gadol. As Tosafot Yom-Tov points out, this must be referring to a situation in which the high priest's brother is appointed as his potential replacement in the week leading up to Yom Kippur (cf: Yoma 1:1, Megillah 1:9).</p>\n\n<p>According to Rabbeinu Tam (Tosafot, Ketubot 58a, s.v. <em>va'afilu kulan bifnei haba'al</em>), a <em>shomeret yavam</em> is already like the deceased husband's brother's wife, and technically even allowed to consume terumah if he is a kohen. The Mishna forbids such consumption (Yevamot 7:4, Ketubot 5:3), but by rabbinic enactment only. <em>Mid'orayta</em>, she is like his wife until he either cements the relationship with <em>yibum</em> or terminates it with <em>chalitzah</em>. Since the gemara learns out from Leviticus 16:6 that a kohen gadol can only have <em>one</em> wife while he is fulfilling his duties on Yom Kippur, then Rabbeinu Tam's conception of <em>yibum</em> is such that if one of the two brothers dies on Yom Kippur itself, the only way that the other might officiate is if he first performs <em>chalitzah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Does anybody know of any sources that discuss the performance of <em>chalitzah</em> on Yom Kippur (the visual of a high priest on the holiest day being spat at is quite striking, and adds to other imagery relating to the decline of the priesthood);</li>\n<li>Does anybody know of any prohibition of performing <em>chalitzah</em> on Yom Kippur (or any Shabbat), and whether or not there was a problem with the high priest \"technically\" having more than one wife on the day?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam (who technically allows her to eat Terumah) is talking about a Shomeres L'bias Heter (at least MedRabanan (see Rambam Hil. Terumah end of Chap. 7)), but in the case of the KG she is Shomeres L'bias Issur Shel Torah and does not eat Terumah (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/7307.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam ibid 7:21</a>). We do not find that RT holds that Zeikas Yovom that is Ossur Min Hatorah is considered his wife and eats Terumah. Also see Mishna and Rashi <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=56b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevomos 56b</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In general, Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 339:4 it says Chalitzah can not be done on Shabbos, and in 524:1 it says it can not be done on Yom Tov. Also keep in mind that he has to wear a shoe to do Chalitzah and the type of shoe for Chalitza is one that can not be worn on Yom Kippur (see Yevomos 202b).</p>\n\n\n",

The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch at 193:13 says that when visiting a sick person who is near death, the visitor should engage the patient in conversation and encourage him to \"recite the confession\" (i.e. the vidui), and assure the patient that doing so does not assure his death, as many have recited the vidui and recovered.  If he can only speak a bit, one is to have the patient say, \"May my death be an atonement for all my sins,\" and that he should request forgiveness from any person he has wronged.</p>\n\n<p>But I have seen patients who were unconscious before death and unable to confess their sins, so loved ones would recite the vidui for them.

If it is, it's limited to cases where there's a real possibility that the patient is aware of what's going on.  It's probably also worth saying first \"We're going to say the viduy for you now.

We do use some tools (Shtar, Halifin) to effect the sale and make sure it's \"legitimate\". As two example issues of this general question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can a totally ludicrous amount of חמץ be sold at a totally ludicrous price? Does the buyer need to have some credible ability to effect the sale (assets, investors, etc.)?</li>\n<li>I know a person needs to be a willing party to any sale, but can Hefker Beith Din Hefker be imposed on anyone who is not interested in participating (yes, there are other ramifications, like if the now-former owner eats the food that was just sold he'd be stealing from the buyer, but in theory it should work, right)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tying those example issues into an out-there example scenario: could the Chief Rabbinate of Israel sell the חמץ of <em>all</em> the Jews of Israel to a local, non-Jewish day-laborer?</p>\n\n<p><strong>In short, what limits are in place to ensure the sale of חמץ before פסח is legitimate?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (Ch. 114) states that the sale has to be valid from a civil point of view. Any trace of making this into a <em>religious ceremony</em> invalidates the sale.</p>\n\n<p>He discusses <strong>overcharging</strong>, which could invalidate the sale; as this clearly makes a joke out of the sale when you know that nobody would pay these ludicrous prices. Supposedly <strong>undercharging</strong> would be OK if the seller is really prepared to actually suffer the loss.</p>\n\n<p>He does mention that after Pessach the non-Jew is asked to pay up, and if he doesn't have the cash, the Chametz it bought back. It seems that the sale is valid even if there's no real possibility of the original buyer ever being able to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the Kitzur provides a sample document, and in it every item is priced.</p>\n\n<p>So, to your questions, based in the above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can a totally ludicrous amount of חמץ be sold at a totally ludicrous\n  price?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the seller agrees, then yes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does the buyer need to have some credible ability to effect the sale\n  (assets, investors, etc.)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. It's perfectly legal to buy things without being able to afford them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can Hefker Beith Din Hefker be imposed on anyone who is not interested\n  in participating</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How would that work?

The reason is that the man is commanded to have children, and after 10 years with no pregnancy, he needs to do something else to fulfill the Mitzvah. It follows from that if we know the issue is with the man, there is no such obligation at all. (The Talmud there raises this possibility, and it is further discussed in the sources further on).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it an obligation or just recommended as a praiseworthy thing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/4115.htm#8\">Ishus 15:8</a>) says it is obligatory and non-negotiable (i.e. he is forced, just as he is forced to marry), and S.A. E.H. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x8233\">154:10</a> paskens this way. The Rama, however (E.H. 1:3 and 154:10) says that in most issues of marriage issues we no longer force anybody to do these things (insist they get married, insist they divorce, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The Pischei Teshuva 154 s.v. 27 brings opinions that one is not personally obligated to divorce either and brings a lengthy discussion as to why. The upshot is that there are several opinions that this law only applies to someone living in Israel, and even according to the other opinions, there are limits to how much one has to lose in order to fulfill a positive commandment, and losing a wife of 10 years can be a tremendous loss. Note the context he is talking about is divorce where marrying a second additional wife is not possible due to the Cherem of Rabbeinu Gershom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does it matter if the husband already fulfilled the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes it does.

As the Targum [Onkelos] renders: וְנָח, and rested. Now every expression of נוֹפֶשׁ, rest, is an expression of נֶפֶשׁ, soul, for one regains one’s soul and one’s breath when one rests from the toil of work. He about Whom it is written: “He neither tires nor wearies” (Isa. 40:28), and Whose every act is performed by speech [alone, without physical effort], dictated rest in reference to Himself [only] in order <strong>to make it understood to the [human] ear</strong> with words that it can understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The word לשבר can also mean to break, in fact I usually her the term לשבר האוזן used to mean to \"break the ear\" meaning so say something so outlandish to either prove a point or beg a question.

I could think that it means [Mount Sinai smoked] like the kiln and no more. Therefore, [to clarify this,] Scripture states: “[the mountain was] blazing with fire up to the heart of the heaven” (Deut. 4:11) [meaning that the fire was far greater than in a lime kiln]. <strong>Why then does the Torah say \"kiln\"? In order to explain to the [human] ear what it is able to hear, [i.e., to give the reader a picture that can be imagined]. He gives the creatures [humans] a sign familiar to them.</strong> Similar to this [is the description in reference to God:] “He shall roar like a lion” (Hos. 11:10). Who but Him gave strength to the lion? Yet the Scriptures compare Him to a lion? But we describe Him and compare Him to His creatures in order to explain to [humans] what the ear is able to hear. Similar to this [is], “And its sound [the voice of God] was like the sound of abundant waters” (Ezek. 43:2). Now who gave the water a sound but He? Yet you describe Him and compare Him to His creatures in order to explain to [humans] what the ear is able to hear. — [from Mechilta]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ya'aqov Etzyon( in the name of \"researchers\") understands this to mean, that Torah is using a figurative expression, to bring the concept closer to our understanding, so it can \"crack open the ear\"( the expression \"כדי שתבקע אוזן\" is in fact used in the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mehilta/shmot19.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekhilta on Shemot 19</a>:5), and make it's way through, and settle in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand( not mentioned in said article), the <em>Mekhilta</em> on Shemot 19:18( which is given as Rhashi's source, in the translation I quoted above) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה תלמוד לומר כבשן? \n  <strong>לשכך את האוזן</strong> מה שהיא יכולה לשמוע </p>\n  \n  <p>וכיוצא בו: אריה שאג מי לא יירא \n  מי נתן כח וגבורה בארי, לא הוא?! \n  אלא הרי אנו מכנין אותו, <strong>לשכך את האוזן</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>כיוצא בו: הנה כבוד אלוהי ישראל בא מדרך הקדים וגו'. \n  מי נתן כח וגבורה במים, לא הוא?! \n  אלא הרי אנו מכנין אותו מבריותיו, <strong>לשכך האוזן</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and in my translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why does the Torah say <em>Kivshan</em>(kiln)? <strong>To soothe the ear</strong> [with] what it can [bear to] hear.</p>\n  \n  <p>And similar to this: “He shall roar like a lion”.

It doesn't come to a clear conclusion. The Rambam (Brachot 5:1) and others rule it is a doubt and this is how the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 186:1</a>) concludes. Rashi (ibid. sv. או דרבנן) suggests that the Talmud considered that women might be exempt biblically from bentching because the verse which is the source for bentching states (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0508.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut 8:10</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאָכַלְתָּ, וְשָׂבָעְתָּ--וּבֵרַכְתָּ אֶת-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, עַל-הָאָרֶץ הַטֹּבָה אֲשֶׁר נָתַן-לָךְ‏<br>\n  And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless the LORD thy God for the good land which He hath given thee</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and we know that the women were not accounted for in the initial division of the land. (Even the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0427.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">daughters of Tzlofchad</a> were only claiming their father's portion.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A mixed-gender group <strong>can</strong> form a zimun if they're family.</p>\n\n<p>Details can be found in an article published in <a href=\"http://www.bmj.org.il/akdama/34/m\" rel=\"nofollow\">this journal</a>.

This sentence captures the essence of Zimun in that the 3 people who make up the Zimun must be one unit. Thus if one of the 3 ate a dairy meal and the others meat, or one ate at a separate table or did not end the meal with the other 2, then they can not be considered one unit since they have not \"eaten as one\". In the case of women, it is not considered modest for men and women to eat together; therefore, there is nothing to bind them together as one unit. While this reason certainly does not apply to one's wife and children, the rabbis do not make that distinction and, once we disallow men and women from making a Zimun, that includes the situation where the men and women are close relatives.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The woman’s obligation in Zimun is very real so in a case where she eats with 3 men she should not leave until she bentches with the Zimun. The case for 3 women who ate together is also a strong one but I think we don't again out of modesty although I am not sure.</p>\n\n\n",

He took the hammer he had used to smash the idols and placed it in the hand of the remaining idol. When his father returned, he was furious and demanded an explanation. Avram insisted that the large idol had destroyed all the others, to which his father replied that this was impossible, because the idols are made of stone. To this, Avram responded that he had proven his point.  But the story doesn't end there - his own father turned him over to Nimrod, a powerful warrior and leader, who led the opposition to the Monotheistic tradition that had been handed down via Noah's descendants.

    "content": "# Premature birth contradicting science\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am a teacher at a private all-girls Jewish high school.  There are two science teachers in the school, and both of us are Christian.  I was talking with my fellow science teacher recently, and she mentioned that during a discussion in her human anatomy and physiology class her students brought up that they had learned in one of their religious classes that, if a baby was to be born prematurely, it is better for a baby to be born eight weeks early, for example, rather than six weeks early because the lungs are stronger at 32 weeks gestation than they are at 34 weeks gestation .  Obviously, this is contrary to scientific knowledge, but we don't want to trample all over our student's religious beliefs and teachings.  Thus, we are unsure of how to respond to the girls in this instance.  There are only a couple of things I can think of for this type of discrepancy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The particular text they were studying might have been written at a time when very little was understood about human anatomy and reproductive health in general.  I can't recall exactly which class this was discussed in (bekius maybe?).  I am under the impression that it was a rather old text, though not a Biblical text.</li>\n<li>The girls perhaps misinterpreted the text.  I believe they understood the <em>words</em> they were reading, but I wonder if they perhaps missed the <em>point</em> of the text--sort of like reading Shakespeare and getting hung up in the language.</li>\n<li>This is exactly what the author meant and the girls interpreted it correctly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So...\nA)  Is anyone familiar with the text this comes from?\nB)  If so, could you please clarify the interpretation with supportive context such that I can sort of understand it?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>This is from the Babylonian Talmud.  <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%91\">Shabbat 135b</a> says that we don't break Shabbas to save the life of a baby born in its eighth month of gestation.  The idea was that there are 7-month babies and 9-month babies, and an 8-month baby was either an early 9-monther or a late 7-monther and if it were an early 9-monther, it probably wasn't going to make it. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/science.html\">Here</a> is a great documentation of different viewpoints on this issue today (search for the section labelled \"Premature Babies\").  It says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As we already mentioned, the Talmud claims that babies born in their eighth month from conception are not viable [and thus you cannot help them live on Shabbat]. The Chazon Ish (Yoreh Deah 155:4) explains that the sages observed that babies born in their seventh month rarely survived. However, a small but significant percentage lived. In the eighth month, the survival rate dropped even lower. But in the ninth month, the survival rate rose sharply. This phenomenon is reflected in other ancient medical works such as those by Hippocrates and Galen (see J. Preuss, Biblical and Talmudic Medicine, 14:14)....</p>\n  \n  <p>With all this in mind, we can understand the following from Tosefta Shabbat 16:4.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Who is an eight-month [baby]? Any [baby] who has not completed his months. Rebbe says: His signs identify him - his hair and fingernails... Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Whoever has lasted thirty days is not a stillborn...</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>According to the first anonymous opinion, any baby born in its eighth month, i.e. who has not completed its nine-month development period, is considered to be an eight-month baby that will not survive. According to Rebbe, only a baby that is born in its eighth month and is not developed enough to have fingernails and hair is considered to be an eight-month baby. Even if a baby is born in its eighth month, if it is fully developed it is deemed viable and treated appropriately. According to R' Shimon ben Gamliel, any baby that survives its first thirty days is deemed viable.  [Other opinions are noted....] Regardless, the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 330:7-8, Yoreh Deah 266:11) rules that a baby born in its eighth month that has fingernails and hair is considered viable in regard to the laws of Shabbat. What is significant is that the rabbis recognized that a baby born in its eighth month can live a full and long life. However, based on their observations and medical knowledge, they said that the overwhelming majority does not. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article goes on to explain how various folks on the right-wing of Judaism understand the text nowadays.  Some people claim nature has changed.  Others claim that medicine has changed to make it a non-issue.  On the more \"modern\" branches of Orthodox Judaism, there are many who are willing to say that the rabbis at that time were wrong in their science.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, no one that I have ever heard of follows this ruling today.  We break Shabbat to save any baby's life.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So the school that you teach at may be very right-wing and thus teaches that the rabbis of the Talmud were correct and that nature has not changed.  I personally cannot begin to understand or explain why, but you might want to ask the head of Judaics.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For more context, vague dates on the above sources are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tosefta (part of the oral law): c. 200</li>\n<li>Talmud (commentary on the oral law): c. 500</li>\n<li>Shulchan Aruch (legal code): mid-1500s</li>\n<li>Chazon Ish (commentary on Shulchan Aruch): mid-1900s</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>First, you should remember how bad infant mortality was in those days. So what it says about how some infants were considered not viable (and thus could not be touched on Shabbos), no longer applies today when infant mortality is much lower. You should talk about the change in infant mortality with your students.</p>\n\n<p>The way you phrased your question implies that the girls believe that \"if only the baby had been born a little earlier it would have been stronger\". This is NOT what the Talmud says.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud says that there are babies with 7 month gestation, and some with 9.</p>\n\n<p>But a baby does not go from strong-weak-strong. A 9 month baby gets stronger each month including the 8th, for a 9 month baby being born in the 7th month would be very bad.</p>\n\n<p>Today we no longer see any 7 month babies. All the babies are 9 month babies.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/935247/jewish/Chapter-Twenty-Five.htm#footnote12a935247\">Rambam, Shabbos, Chapter 25, a footnote by R' Eliyahu Touger</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yevamot 80b states that a child born after only eight months will surely die. Therefore, even while he is still living, it is forbidden to carry him on the Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosafot, Shabbat 135a, states that this ruling is no longer followed, since at present it is impossible to determine exactly when a child was conceived. Therefore, we cannot be certain of the length of time the mother was pregnant. Furthermore, the advances in medical technology have enabled us to save the lives of many babies who would surely not have survived in previous generations. At present, it is a mitzvah to attempt to save the lives of all premature babies, even if doing so involves performing a forbidden labor on the Sabbath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/932325/jewish/Chapter-One.htm\">Rambam, Milah, Chapter 1, and the footnote is by R' Eliyahu Touger</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Halacha 13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The following principles apply when] a child is born in the eighth month [of pregnancy]:1 If the child's nails and hair are completely formed, we assume that this is a completely formed infant that should have been born in the seventh month, but whose birth was delayed. Hence, the baby may be carried on the Sabbath, is not considered to be a stone, and may be circumcised on the Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>If, however, when the baby was born, its hair and nails were incompletely formed, we can be certain that this child is in its eighth month of development and should not have been born until the ninth month, but was born prematurely. Therefore, he is considered as a stone and may not be moved on the Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, if such an infant remains alive for thirty days, he is considered to be a child who will live and is governed by all the same rules as other infants.2 Whenever a human child lives longer than thirty days, it is no longer considered to be a stillborn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Halacha 14</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The following rules apply when] a child is born in the seventh month of gestation: If a child is born with his limbs completely formed,3 we assume that he will live and he should be circumcised on the eighth day [even if it falls on the Sabbath].</p>\n  \n  <p>If there is a question whether a child4 was born in the seventh month or in the eighth month, he can be circumcised on the Sabbath. The rationale is: If he was born in the seventh month and his limbs are completely formed, it is appropriate that [his circumcision] supersede [the prohibitions against labor on] the Sabbath. If he was born in the eighth month, circumcising him [does not constitute a violation of the Sabbath prohibitions].5 It is like cutting meat, because he is like a stillborn if he is, in fact, born in the eighth month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Footnote 1: (the rest don't discuss this topic):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The comprehension of this and the following halachah are dependent on the following two Talmudic passages:</p>\n  \n  <p>[The prohibitions against labor on] the Sabbath are superseded for [the circumcision of a child] born in the seventh month, but not for a child born in the eighth month (Shabbat 135a).</p>\n  \n  <p>A child born in the eighth month is like a stone and may not be carried [on the Sabbath]. His mother may, however, lean over him and nurse him....\n  Rabbi states: [This is when] his physical features reflect his [lack of development]; i.e., when his hair and nails are not completely formed.\n  [Rabbi's statements imply that] if [his hair and nails] are completely formed, he is a baby that should have been born in the seventh month, but whose birth was delayed (Yevamot 80b).</p>\n  \n  <p>From these passages, it appears that the Sages considered that there were two periods of gestation that could produce healthy babies, a seven-month period and a nine-month period. Therefore, a baby who was born in the seventh month was considered to be healthy, and circumcision could be performed on the Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>In contrast, a baby born in the eighth month was generally considered to be unhealthy. Not only was the baby not to be circumcised on the Sabbath, but moving it at all was forbidden. Since it was likely to die, it was considered to be muktzeh. If, however, a baby born in the eighth month looks healthy, we assume that it should have been born in the seventh month, but its birth was delayed. Therefore, it is considered a healthy baby and it may be circumcised on the Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>We have used the past tense in the above explanation, because these laws are no longer practiced, and all babies are allowed to be moved on the Sabbath. Tosafot, Shabbat, loc. cit., state that at present, it is no longer possible to determine exactly when a child was conceived, and we therefore do not know the month of pregnancy the mother was in. Furthermore, the advances in medical technology have enabled the lives of many premature babies to be saved despite the fact that, without these new developments, these babies would surely not have survived. At present, it is considered a mitzvah to try to save the lives of any premature babies, even if doing so involves carrying out forbidden labors on the Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>Also, it must be emphasized that, as stated in Halachot 16-18, a child is circumcised only when it is healthy and there is no danger involved. This is surely relevant with regard to premature infants. Rarely, if ever, would a doctor grant permission for such a baby to be circumcised on the eighth day of his life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I hope I didn't overdo it with copying the text.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>RaMBaM, Rabbi Mosha ban Maimon, Maimonides, was the biggest doctor in his time in Egypt working under the sultan Saladin (I think). He was not only a great scientist but was also a known philosopher and one of the biggest rabbis in his time period, and his teachings are still held high by most if the Jewish world. In his book, Morah HaNavuchim, Guide for the Perplexed, he describes that the sciences in the time of the sages were not as they were in his times, and that we can't blame the sages for their teachings because it was the science in their times which was wrong not the sages themselves. Well, the same rule, given by Maimonides, applies to him too, for the science in his time is not like our science and he should not be blamed for it; but it should be understood that they did the best they could in this field without using any of the super high tech stuff we have nowadays. So my approach to this problem of yours would be that you should quote Maimonides and explain to your students who he was, and explain what he said regarding science, and explain to them that a person is not infallible and should not be mad that science nowadays states something different from what's in a book which contains knowledge from over 2000 years ago. The Talmud is not a science book but a book of laws. They should learn the laws and study science from a science text book. Something along those lines would do good I hope. HasSlocho Rabo (much success) and I hope the kids don't take this a whole different way than expected.</p>\n\n\n",

When Yehudah encounters his daughter-in-law, Tamar, at the crossroads, he mistakes her for a prostitute since she had covered her face (ויחשבה לזונה כי כסתה פניה; Genesis 38:15).</p>\n\n<p>The obvious question, of course, is do prostitutes cover their faces? Covering one's face would apparantly be a sign of modesty - not of lewdness. As a result, the Talmud records a rather clever midrash (Sotah 10b), which is quoted by Rashi on our verse. The Talmudic passage is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר אלעזר שכסתה פניה בבית חמיה דא\"ר שמואל בר נחמני א\"ר יונתן כל כלה\n  שהיא צנועה בבית חמיה זוכה ויוצאין ממנה מלכים ונביאים מנלן</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Elazar said, \"She covered her face in the house of her\n  father-in-law, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi\n  Yonatan: every bride who is modest in the house of her father-in-law\n  will merit to have kings and prophets descend from her.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, when the Torah tells us that Yehudah didn't recognise Tamar because she had covered her face, it means that she had always covered her face when she was in his house. Now that she was at the crossroads, with her face uncovered like that of a prostitute, he didn't recognise her.

(v. 65) Mind you, she had no veil on for the entire journey with Abraham's servant - APPARENTLY, there was no \"modesty requirement\" compelling her to wear a veil when with the servant.  Rather, when she meets her fiance - someone who she wants to and should look sexually attractive for! (see v. 67) - she then decides to put on a veil.  </p>\n\n<p>(Much of this answer is developed at length by Olivia Wizniter, at <a href=\"http://curiousjew.blogspot.com/2008/02/symbolic-veil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://curiousjew.blogspot.com/2008/02/symbolic-veil.html</a> )  </p>\n\n\n",

The straps must be re-blackened if the paint becomes scratched or abraded (<em>Bach</em> OC 32:25). Abrasions are especially common (if not readily noticeable) in the vicinity of the knot of the <em>shel yad</em>, and special attention should be paid to that area of the <em>r'tzu'a</em> (<em>Mishna B'rura</em> 33:19). </p>\n\n<p>The <em>Bi'ur Halacha</em> (to 33:3, s.v. הרצועות שחורות) is undecided regarding whether the entire length of the straps must be black for the <em>t'fillin</em> to be valid,  or whether the <em>t'fillin</em> are valid if even the minimum required length for <em>r'tzu'os</em> are black (see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> OC 27:8,11 for the minimum required lengths). Rabbi Kaganoff <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/1775\" rel=\"noreferrer\">cites</a> R' Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld as ruling that if even the majority of the <em>r'tzu'os</em> are black, the <em>t'fillin</em> remain valid.

The <em>Mishna B'rura</em> (32:184) cites multiple <em>acharonim</em> who rule stringently but say that a person may rely on the lenient opinions when <em>t'fillin</em> with completely black <em>batim</em> are not available.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (OC 33:4), it is preferable to paint the <em>t'fillin lishmah</em>, while the <em>Rama</em> (ad loc.) holds that the straps must be painted <em>lishmah</em> and that it is proper to paint the <em>batim lishmah</em>. Since the <em>Rama</em> does not hold that lack of paint on the <em>batim</em> invalidates the <em>t'fillin</em>, he writes that a lack of <em>lishmah</em> does not invalidate the painting of the <em>batim</em>. </p>\n\n\n",

However, we do not recite a blessing over the circumcision, but we do give him a name by which to be remembered so that they will have mercy on him from Heaven and he will be revived at the Revivification of the Dead, and he will have the understanding to recognize his father and mother at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The circumcision is not a fulfillment of the mitzvah of bris milah, but is performed only to avoid burial of the child in the \"shameful\" state of being uncircumcised.  See Beur HaGra 263:10.  The Kitzur goes on to say that this circumcision is so important that if the baby was buried without doing the circumcision first, and they remembered right after the burial, they should reopen the grave and do it right away.  If a few days have passed and decomposition is probable, then they do not do it.  K.S.A. 163:7.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the language \"within eight days or afterwards\" and the references to \"shame\" I would imagine that an older boy or man, who could not be circumcised because of medical reasons, but would have otherwise, then this law would also apply.

More often it was either neglected by assimilated parents, or, as in the case here, a result of Communist Russian oppression. The man in this case wants to be circumcised. <a href=\"http://www.mohelinsouthflorida.com/2015/12/being-uncircumcised-jew.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">He should leave instructions for the chevra kadisha to take care of it for him</a>. </p>\n\n\n",

During this time, on Lag Ba-Omer, the Jews were winning, that is why they turned this day into a great day of celebration.</p>\n<p>ידענו כי ר' עקיבא היה הולך ונוסע ומלמד בכל תפוצת הארץ ובכל מקום היה לו תלמידים הרבה מאוד <strong>ועין שחושב לבר כוזבא כמשיח קרא כל תלמידיו להלחם בצד בר כוזבא</strong> ותחת רגליו נגד חיל האויבים... ואף על פי שבתחילה חלשו היהודים את אויביהם לפי חרב אחר כך גברו הרומיים ולכדו מישראל עיר ועיר ובאותה זמן היתה מלחמה בכל יום יום <strong>ובכל מלחמה נפלו ומתו הרבה אנשים מחיל בר כוזבא ובהן כמה תלמידי ר' עקיבא</strong> וכששקעה החמה בכל יום ויום פסקה המלחמה ואז נקברו כל המתים. ואפשר שבתוך כל המלחמות הללו שהיו יום יום ושבהם גברו האויביהם על ישראל היה יום אחד והוא ל\"ג בעומר שגבר בו ישראל אותו יום שבו היה להם ישעות ה' בעת צרתם יום גבורה ותשועה אותו יום קבעו ליום שמחה לדור דורים וכמו כן שמעתי גם מפי הרב דק\"ק פוזנא מוהר\"ר זאב פיילכענפעלד ז\"ל (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7828&st=&pgnum=50&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">זכרון יוסף צבי, סי' תצ\"ג</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation of the bold parts: And since he (Rebbi Akiva) considered Bar Kosiba the Moshiach he called to his students to fight on the side of Bar Kosiba.</p>\n<p>...And in each battle many soldiers of Bar Kosiba fell, among them students of Rebbi Akiva</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The students mentioned in yevamoth could not have died in the times of Bar-Kochba. Firstly the talmud speaks of students in his (R. Akiba's) youth and students in his old age - so there had to be a respectable amount of time between the death of his first students and the studies with his latter students.  </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, R. Akiba was arrested in tishre after the fall of Betar and was killed two years later (137 or 138). He spent those two years in jail. (The five students were meanwhile getting ordained by R Yehuda ben Babba (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=14&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 14a</a>), and then fleeing the land of Israel.) There was no time for R. Akiva to \"go south\" to teach the 5.(Anyway after Bar-Kochba the south was totally destroyed (see <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69%2a.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">para 14</a> ) . \nAlso R. Meir came first to R. Akiba but didn't have the pre-requisites so he studied with R. Yishmael and then returned to R. Akiba. R. Yishmael was killed in the beginning of the war...  </p>\n\n<p>So the first students would have had to die earlier. I guess there are maybe two other possibilites: they died during the Hurban or they died during the Kitos War? </p>\n\n\n",

He was \"pores mappah\", made kiddush and continued to eat. Now, after a meal eaten wholly on Hoshanah Rabbah, one says \"Sukkos\" in Yaleh V'Yavo in Bircas HaMazon; after a meal eaten wholly on Shmini Etzeres, one says \"Shmini Etzeres\". So what about this felow who started on Hoshanah Rabbah and ended on Shmini Etzeres: When he recites Bircas HaMazon what day should be mentioned in Yaleh V'Yavo, \"Sukkos\" or \"Shmini Etzeres\"? What's the reason why and please cite all sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Pri Megadim in Ashel Avraham Siman 188 Sif-Katan 18 discusses this exact shailo. He writes that it is similar to the shailo of when Rosh Chodesh comes out after Shabbos and one eats after nightfall. According to the Taz one mentions both Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh. He said so to in this case one would mention both Sukkos and Shmini Atzeres (which is quite surprising since it's not 2 seperate things.) However (if I understand correctly) he says that according to the Magen Avraham one \"wouldn't say\". What I believe he means is that one wouldn't say Sukkos and would only say Shmini Atzeres that is because in the case of Rosh Chodesh coming out Motzei Shabbos the M\"A holds that if one eats when it's already night they <em>only</em> mention Rosh Chodesh and not Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shliach Tzibbur and Tashlumim for missed tefillah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The M\"B in Siman 108 Sif-Katan 4 brings that someone who missed a tefillah and is now the shliach tzibbur may use the chazaras ha'shatz for his tashlumim.</p>\n\n<p>(Makor in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1952&st=&pgnum=130\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radbaz Siman 361</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The Radbaz does clearly say this. But why? Consider a case where the person missed shachris and is now davening mincha. The shliach tziibur is a shliach to daven mincha for the tzibbur how can he also have kavana (intention) for the tefillah to be good for his teshlumim from Shachris?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The tashlumin that one davens for missing a tefillah is not going back in time to that missed tefillah.  When you daven two minchas, one is a mincha, and the other is a mincha that is making up for a missed tefillah (as opposed to the other being an out-of-place shacharis).</p>\n\n<p>This is seen from the halacha that if you miss mincha on erev Shabbos, for example, you would daven two tefillos on Friday night, both of which will be maariv of Shabbos (Shulchan Aruch O.C. 108:9) - even though you missed a 19-blessing weekday mincha, you \"make it up\" with a 7-blessing Shabbos davening. In fact, some opinions hold (Ta\"z) that if you would mess up and accidentally daven a weekday davening, it wouldn't count.</p>\n\n<p>The only difference between the two davenings is that the second one is the one being done because you missed the first.  But the two are interchangeable in terms of which tefillah you are davening.  In fact, the M.B. cites a halacha that if you davened twice to make up for a missed tefillah, and then you realize that you messed up your first davening of the two, if you did not explicitly intend for the second to be the make-up, the second one will count as your obligatory davening, even though if you hadn't messed up the first would have been the obligatory and the second would have been the make-up. (In other words, the same davening that would have fulfilled your make-up requirement can become your obligatory davening - it seems that one is not mutually exclusive of the other.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think the Radvaz answers this with these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והשנייה בקול רם יכוין לתשלומין ולהוציא את מי שאינו בקי</p>\n<p>With the second out loud he should intend as a make-up <em>and</em> to exempt the one who isn't fluent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shliach Tzibbur is being Yotzei the ones who can't say their own Tefilah under the principel of יצא מוצאי - someone who already fulfilled their obligation can say it for and exempt someone else. So when the Shliach Tzibbur is saying Shmona Esre the second time, he generally is doing it to be Motzei others, despite his not having an obligation. He can, at the same time, have a second intention - to fulfill his own Tashlumin. This is because the Tashlumin is a fixing of <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/8/108/7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his mistakes</a>, but is not considered a prayer in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/8/108/2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">its time</a>, rather is a request for mercy, which does not contradict having someone else in mind.</p>\n\n\n",

Those schools were responsible for producing tosafot on the Babylonian Talmud: complex analyses that served to make the text an exceedingly complicated yet a consistent and self-referential system.

The language of culture in Christian Europe was Latin. Ashkenazic Jewry spoke the vernacular and wrote its rabbinic corpus in Hebrew, but could not, for the most part, read or understand Latin...To be sure, Jews in northern France and Germany could understand Christian sermons that were preached publicly in the vernacular...Indeed, the Ba'alei ha-Tosafot even acquired some familiarity with Christian doctrine...But despite the evidence for contact in a number of areas, there is no indication that Jews were familiar with the bulk of Christian theological, legal, or philosophical literature. The overall orientation of the Ba'alei ha-Tosafot can be best described as Talmudocentric. They occupied themselves almost exclusively with the study and interpretation of the Talmud and other sacred texts and were not familiar, at least not formally, with philosophy, science or \"the humanities\".

    "content": "# How do I get myself to yearn for moshiach if I'm comfortable in the diaspora?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Intellectually I know that we're supposed to yearn for the coming of the mashiach and the in-gathering in Eretz Yisrael.  I know that one of the Rambam's 13 principles calls for this.  We pray for this multiple times per day.</p>\n\n<p>In my head I know all that, but not what to do if I'm not feeling it.  (Never have; this isn't a regression.)  I'm actually pretty comfortable here in the American diaspora, and a part of me wonders if, had I lived then, I would have returned from Babylon -- not because I want to be \"bad\" but because inertia plus lack of yearning tends to mean you stay put.</p>\n\n<p>I can't be the first person who's struggled with this, saying the prayers but doubting them as they pass my lips, trying to align head and heart in the correct direction.  Has anyone who struggled with this and conquered it written about it -- what did he do that worked, what new perspective helped him, etc?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 29)\n\n<p>I will tell you something that has completely changed my avodas Hashem. You have to stop focusing on yourself and start focusing on God. This sounds very simple but in practice is very hard to do. That means coming to terms with the fact that, in whatever way we can understand this, God is (k'vayachol) pained or unhappy that his children are in exile and that his house is gone. </p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, for me, I have found that means talking to God, as often as possible. I get an email \"please daven for so and so\" besides sitting at my desk and saying a quick chapter of tehillim I try to also verbalize aloud my own prayer in English. Something like, \"Please God, one of your children is sick which I'm sure pains you. Please heal this person quickly.\" </p>\n\n<p>That is an example, but the idea is to \"interact\" with God in a real and meaningful way as often as possible and to verbally call attention to it when you do it. For example I walk past a delicious smelling treif pizza place and say, \"God, that food smells delicious but you commanded me not to eat it, so I want you to know the reason I'm not going inside there right now is because I value your will and want to keep your commandments\"</p>\n\n<p>Overtime I have found that this has made God a lot more \"real\" to me, which I know sounds weird, but I don't know how else to describe it. Then you get to Tisha B'Av and it really starts to hit you. Or you see things like what happened to the Fogel family and it really hits you. This is not how things are meant to be. But now you see those things and it prompts you to dialogue with God. \"Please God end the suffering of your people.\" </p>\n\n<p>Suddenly there is a new perspective. Sure life is good for many Jews in the diaspora (Baruch Hashem) but when that happiness comes at the expense of another who is so saddened by the situation that is exactly what the gemarah (Gittin 58a) describes as the source for the exile in the first place. How petty have our lives become that having a nice house and physical comforts makes us forget that God Almighty has no home. Then it becomes much easier to relate to really wanting Moshiach </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Please note I don't know you at all and nothing in this answer should be taken as a personal criticism. It is a general statement about the attitude of <strong>some</strong> Jews in Diaspora </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Not a complete answer, but the first step is to truly learn about Moshiach and the Messianic era. Understanding the fundamentals about why Judaism necessitates a belief in Moshiach in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel_Kahn\">Yoel Kahan</a> wrote a Sefer (book) explaining why Moshiach and the Resurrection of the Dead are two of the Rambam's 13 principles of faith. Why does he consider them so central to Jewish Belief? Shmuly Boteach translated the Sefer into English in a book entitled \"<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0876683391\">The Wolf Shall Lie With the Lamb: The Messiah in Hasidic Thought</a>\".</p>\n\n<p>Also, learn Chabad Chassidic Philosophy. From the beginning, Chabad Chassidus has explained and emphasized why and how Moshiach is the completion of our service in this world (see for example <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7915/jewish/Chapter-36.htm\">Chapter 36 of Tanya</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The truth is that Exile is darkness, and the reason you're so comfortable in the darkness is that you've never seen the light (don't worry, none of us have). The seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe would call this \"a doubled and re-doubled darkness\", a darkness that is itself concealed, until you don't even realize it is dark. The more you learn about what the world should be, and how you can bring it to that state, the more you'll start feeling it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>I'll be honest. I'm a lazy, pampered and comfortable American Jew. As much as I'd like to make aliyah or somehow be part of shivat tziyon, I like the creature comforts of the ol' US of A (things like tuna fish, alumionum foil and English). It would be nice if I could stir my soul to want to move and maybe I should be praying to change my own attitude but that rarely works.</p>\n\n<p>So I don't. I pray for moshiach. The way I see it, ymot hamashiach are going to be the uber-America. A kosher pizza place on every corner, a shul where I actually feel comfortable, and an outlawing of calculus and to a lesser degree, word problems.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I am happy here, I also recognize that (as tough as it sounds) ymot hamashiach are going to be better. Answers to all the annoying questions I have which are left unresolved. An understanding and a way of dealing with people that will make sense. A sense of safety and security which transcends the ADT sign on my front law. And maybe Sally Forth will finally make me laugh.</p>\n\n<p>This place is great. We are lucky to have it. But the presence of the shechina is mighty tempting and when I daven, I think about what I can do to get to that even better situation.</p>\n\n\n",

May be that it is similar to Demai from this point of view. The cases of Nazir which can \"\"Lehishael\" and truma which can too,  are perhaps an additional proof for the Egg Matso minhag which can also be nish'al. I heard that the Steipeler זצוק\"ל was stringent to eat \"not Gebrocht\". When his spouse deceased, he was invited to his daughter.

What were Bar Kochba's perceived sins and why was this punishment appropriate?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r2904.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis פרק ד הלכה ה</a> and <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01640.html#HtmpReportNum0002_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medrash Raba in Eicha 2:4</a>  inform us that Bar Kochava killed his uncle Rabbi Elazar Hamoda'i for no reason, except that he believed a scheming talebearing non-Jew.</p>\n\n<p>The story - which is almost identical in both places - is as follows: (Translation from <a href=\"http://www.breslev.co.il/articles/holidays_and_fast_days/three_weeks/the_false_messiah.aspx?id=24503&language=english\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Elazar Hamodia's prayers sustained Betar for so long that Hadrian almost lost heart and returned home to Rome.</p>\n\n<p>A sly Cuthean went to Hadrian and said: \"My lord, as long as that old rooster wallows in ashes, you will not conquer the city. But I will do something that will enable you to subdue it today.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Cuthean, spying for the Romans, entered Betar by way of a sewer. He entered the local synagogue, where he found Rabbi Eleazar deeply immersed in prayer, so much so that he was completely unaware of everything and everyone around him. The Cuthean acted like he was whispering in the ear of Rabbi Eleazar. Onlookers hurried to carry the tale to Bar Koziva: 'Your uncle, Rabbi Eleazar, is acting just like his teachers before him who wanted to appease the Romans; he wishes to surrender the city to Hadrian.'</p>\n\n<p>The furious Bar Koziva summoned the Cuthean and asked: “What did you say to my uncle?”</p>\n\n<p>The Jew-hating spy replied: 'If I tell you, the emperor will kill me; and if I do not tell you, you will kill me. It is better that I should kill myself and the secrets of the government be not divulged.'</p>\n\n<p>Bar Koziva suspected that the old rabbi wanted to surrender the city. He ordered that Rabbi Elazar be brought to him. He accused him, “What did the Cuthean tell you?”</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Elazar answered: “I do not know what he whispered in my ear, nor did I hear anything, because I was standing in prayer and am unaware of what he said.”</p>\n\n<p>Bar Koziva flew into a rage, kicking the frail fasting rabbi and killing him on the spot. A heavenly voice issued forth and proclaimed: '”You have paralyzed the arm of Israel and blinded their right eye!” This was a reference to Rabbi Elazar HaModai, in whose virtue Betar continued to exist. Betar and Bar Koziva no longer had the protection of the saintly rabbi's prayers and righteousness. The city was doomed and its leader was beheaded that very same day, Tisha B'Av, 135 CE, the tragic day that Betar fell and millions were murdered.</p>\n\n<p>(Tranlsation from <a href=\"http://www.breslev.co.il/articles/holidays_and_fast_days/three_weeks/the_false_messiah.aspx?id=24503&language=english\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Yerusalmi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והוה ר' אלעזר המודעי יושב על השק ועל האפר ומתפלל בכל יום ואומר רבון העולמים אל תשב בדין היום אל תשב בדין היום בעא אדריינוס מיזל ליה.  אמר ליה חד כותיי לא תיזיל לך דאנא חמי מה מיעבד ומשלים לך מדינתא עאל ליה מן ביבא דמתינתא עאל ואשכח רבי אלעזר המודעי קאים מצלי.  עבד נפשיה לחיש ליה בגו אודניה חמוניה בני מדינתא ואייתוניה גבי בן כוזבא.  אמרון ליה חמינן ההן סבא משתעי לחביבך אמר ליה מה אמרת ליה ומה אמר לך אמר ליה אנא אמר לך מלכא קטל לי ואי לא אנא אמר לך את קטל יתי טב לי מלכא קטל יתי ולא את אמר ליה אמר לי דאננא משלים מדינתאי.  אתא גבי רבי אלעזר המודעי אמר ליה מה אמר לך הדין כותייא אמר ליה לא כלום מה אמרת ליה א\"ל לא כלום   יהיב ליה חד בעוט וקטליה.  מיד יצאת בת קול ואמרה (זכריה יא) הוי רעי האליל עזבי הצאן חרב על זרועו ועל עין ימינו זרועו יבוש תיבש ועין ימינו כהה תכהה הרגת את רבי אלעזר המודעי זרוען של כל ישראל ועין ימינם לפיכך זרועו של אותו האיש יבש תיבש ועין ימינו כהה תכהה.  מיד נלכדה ביתר ונהרג בן כזובה ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Medrash Rabba:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שָׁלשׁ שָׁנִים וּמֶחֱצָה הִקִּיף אַדְרִיָאנוּס קֵיסָר לְבֵיתָר, וְהָיָה שָׁם רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר הַמּוֹדָעִי עָסוּק בְּשַׂקּוֹ וּבְתַעֲנִיתוֹ, וּבְכָל יוֹם וָיוֹם מִתְפַּלֵּל וְאוֹמֵר רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם אַל תֵּשֵׁב בַּדִּין הַיּוֹם. וּלְבַסּוֹף נָתַן דַּעְתּוֹ לַחֲזֹר, אֲתָא חַד כּוּתָאי וּמְצָאוֹ וְאָמַר לוֹ, אֲדוֹנִי, כָּל יוֹמִין דַּהֲדָא תַּרְנְגוֹלְתָּא מִתְגַּעְגַּע בְּקִיטְמָא לֵית אַתְּ כָּבֵישׁ לָהּ, אֶלָּא הַמְתֵּן לִי דַּאֲנָא עָבֵיד לָךְ דְּתַכְבְּשִׁנָּהּ יוֹמָא דֵין, מִיָּד עָלֵיל בֵּיהּ בְּבוּבֵיהּ דִּמְדִינְתָּא, וְאַשְׁכְּחֵיהּ לְרַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר דַּהֲוָה קָאֵים וּמַצְלֵי, עֲבַד גַּרְמֵיהּ לָחֵישׁ בְּאוּדְנֵיהּ דְּרַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר הַמּוֹדָעִי, אָזְלוּן וְאָמְרוּן לְבַר כוּזִיבָא חֲבִיבָךְ רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בָּעֵי לְאַשְׁלָמָא מְדִינְתָּא עִם אַדְרִיָּאנוּס, שְׁלַח וְאַתְיֵיהּ לְהַהוּא כּוּתָאי אֲמַר לֵיהּ מַאי אֲמַרְתְּ לֵיהּ. אֲמַר לֵיהּ אִין אֲנָא אָמַר לָךְ, מַלְכָּא קָטֵיל לֵיהּ לְהַהוּא גַבְרָא, וְאִין לֵית אֲנָא אָמַר לָךְ אַתְּ קָטֵיל לֵיהּ לְהַהוּא גַבְרָא, אֲבָל מוּטָב לִיקְטְלֵיהּ הַהוּא גַבְרָא לְגַרְמֵיהּ וְלָא תִתְפָּרְסִין מִיסְטֵירִין דְּמַלְכוּתָא. בֶּן כּוֹזִיבָא סָבַר בְּדַעְתֵּיהּ דִּבְעֵי לְאַשְׁלָמָא מְדִינְתָּא, כֵּיוָן דַּחֲסַל רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר צְלוֹתֵיהּ שְׁלַח וְאַיְיתֵיהּ, אֲמַר לֵיהּ מָה אֲמַר לָךְ הָדֵין כּוּתָאי. אֲמַר לֵיהּ לֵית אֲנָא יָדַע מַה לְּחִישׁ לִי בְּאוּדְנָאי וְלָא שְׁמָעֵת לֵיהּ כְּלוּם דַּאֲנָא בִּצְלוֹתִי קָאֵימְנָא, וְלֵית אֲנָא יָדַע מָה הֲוָה אֲמַר. נִתְמַלֵּא רוּגְזֵיהּ לְבֶן כּוֹזִיבָא יְהַב לֵיהּ חַד בְּעִיטָא בְּרַגְלֵיהּ וְקָטְלֵיהּ, יָצְתָה בַּת קוֹל וְאָמְרָה (זכריה יא, יז): הוֹי רֹעִי הָאֱלִיל עֹזְבִי הַצֹּאן חֶרֶב עַל זְרוֹעוֹ וְעַל עֵין יְמִינוֹ, אָמְרָה לוֹ אַתָּה סִמִּיתָ זְרוֹעָן שֶׁל יִשְׂרָאֵל וְסִמִּיתָ עֵין יְמִינָן, לְפִיכָךְ זְרֹעוֹ שֶׁל אוֹתוֹ הָאִישׁ יָבוֹשׁ תִּיבָשׁ וְעֵין יְמִינוֹ כָּהֹה תִּכְהֶה. מִיָּד גָּרְמוּ עֲוֹנוֹת וְנִלְכְּדָה בֵּיתָר וְנֶהֱרַג בֶּן כּוֹזִיבָא‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Zini\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Eliyahu Zini</a> in his essay on Bar Kochva (in his book Etz Erez), pg. 301-307, Bar Kochva did not die because of his own sins but because of the sins of Am Yisrael: Internal conflicts so harsh that they led to people actually betraying one another to the Romans. In the aggadata, this is represented by the \"Cuthite\" fifth-column, symbolizing loss of national kinship (the Samaritans/Cuthites are people who wished to practice the Jewish religion without submitting to the Judaic ethnic identity, which is a key part of Judaism. They wished to maintain their own personal ethnic identity and to be set apart from the Jews<sup>1</sup>).</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Zini wrote (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Thanks to the words \"immediately the sins caused\" that are missing before us in the Yerushalmi, where instead there is only \"immediately\", we discover the source of the Rambam when he wrote \"until he was killed through the sins\"...we must denounce immediately that which is heard in many places, including in many yeshivot, that it was because of the sins of Bar Kochva that he was killed, meaning, through his killing of his uncle R' Elazar Ha'Modai. Such an understanding is simply an example of boorishness [עם הארצות] that cannot be exceeded...I shall base myself on a greater tree, as Rabbi Tzvi Yehudah Kook zt\"l used to say: \"The Rambam was a <strong>Sephardic sage</strong>, and by him, like all of the Sephardic sages who say \"through the sins\" [בעוונות] which refers to: <strong>The sins of he who says this, and not the sins of whom upon which this is said!!</strong> Meaning, when a Sephardic sage says \"through the sins\", he means \"<strong>through my sins</strong>\"...from this Yerushalmi and other places, we see that this expression was not unique only to the Sephardic sages, but this was the language of all of our rabbis, the sages of Yisrael [he continues and brings more examples of usage of this term in the Talmud]...</p>\n<p>In light of this, the expression \"through the sins\" that is before us refers to <strong>the sins of the general community</strong>. <strong>Bar Kochva was not killed because of his own personal sins, but because of the sins of the generation in its entirety.</strong> The Holy One, Blessed is He gazed upon that generation, and decided that they weren't deserving of being redeemed, because of their sins, which were that internal hatred that originated in the rotten parts of the nation, parts that were even willing to assist our enemies so Bar Kochva wouldn't win. He who symbolizes this internal hatred is once again that \"Cuthite\"...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, when Bar Kochva repeated the verse \"But You have rejected us, O God; God, You do not march with our armies\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.60.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 60:12</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.24a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Taanit 24a</a>) he did not mean \"You have rejected us, therefore do not march with us\" but the opposite, as was properly translated in the English: \"You have rejected us and do not march with us (because you have rejected us)\". Some commentators (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.60.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.60.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Metzudat%20David&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudat David</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.60.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a>) explain this as a good thing - a fall that stems from not having been assisted by God shows us how much we do need Him. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.60.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Alshich&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alshich</a> (if I'm not mistaken) explains the verse as a request from God: \"Please do not make it seem as though we won on our own\". In the same essay, Rabbi Zini argued that the correct interpretation of his words should be as a rhetorical question: \"You would reject us and not march with us?!\" which would of course be a big Chillul Hashem.<br />\nIn short, Bar Kochva's usage of this verse shows great faith in Hashem (not to mention that he used the respectful and very religious term of \"Master of the Universe\" (ריבוניה דעלמא) when speaking to Hashem).</p>\n<p>Lastly, the snake that choked Bar Kochva is tied to the choking death (אסכרה) of the students of Rabbi Akiva and both are symbolic of the same thing: The internal conflicts among the Jews that \"choked\" (חנק) the high chances of the success of the rebellion.</p>\n<p>Side-note: In light of Rabbi Zini's explanation, I think I can explain both why Bar Kochva suspected his uncle of betraying him and why the killing of Rabbi Elazar was not apparently considered a sin (or at least not bad enough to cause Bar Kochva's death):</p>\n<p>Rabbi Elazar said in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.3.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 3:11</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabbi Elazar of Modiin said...and one who annuls the covenant of our father Abraham, may he rest in peace...even though he has to his credit [knowledge of the] Torah and good deeds, he has not a share in the world to come.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While in a number of sources, there's evidence that the soldiers of Bar Kochva would abolish their circumcisions [מושכים בערלותיהם]. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...many abolishers were in the time of ben Kozeva and they all circumcised...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.45a.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Yevamot 45a</a>, my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And according to Rabbi Mordechai Hakohen in his book \"אישים ותקופות\" (People and Eras), pg. 108, the story that appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eichah_Rabbah.2.4?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah 2:4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.24b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Taanit 24b</a> should be understood thus (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Two brothers lived in Kefar Charocha and no Roman who passed by the village was allowed to live. [One time], they said they would use the medicine of the circumcision [i.e., would abolish their circumcision], in order to steal the crown of Hadrian to place it upon the head of Shimon [Bar Kochva]...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, we find that Bar Kochva and his uncle disagreed on what was and what wasn't proper to do during wartime. Bar Kochva was for all-out, no-holds barred war, whilst his uncle was more moderate and criticized those who would abolish their circumcision, even if it was for the important cause of disguising themselves as Roman soldiers to assist in the war effort. Moreover, Rabbi Elazar was likely a student of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.10b.7-12?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 10b</a>) who of course was the person who snuck out of Yerushalayim to meet with the Romans and strike a deal with them. He was later criticized for this action by none other than Bar Kochva's biggest supporter, Rabbi Akiva (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.56b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 56b</a>).</p>\n<p>Now we can perhaps imagine what may have been going on in Bar Kochva's head: He hears troubling rumors about his moderate uncle, who happens to be the student of Rabban Yochanan, who seemingly turned his back on the rebels of the Great Revolt, and his uncle is staying, for some reason, in the last stronghold of the rebellion, Beitar. Alarms go off in his head, as he fears that his uncle may be planning to strike a deal with the Romans - perhaps sparing some of the Jews in return for info on how to bring about the downfall of Beitar, Bar Kochva and his men.</p>\n<p>Interrogating his uncle in order to attempt to deduce the truth is similar to King David's interrogation of the Amalekite youth (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.1.2-16?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:1:2-16</a>): In Bar Kochva's mind, at that moment, Rabbi Elazar was suspected of being a rebel against the throne (מורד במלכות) bent on decimating the rebellion. In a sense, he was also a rodef (רודף) and a danger to the public. Whether Bar Kochva intended to kill his uncle when he kicked him or not isn't so important because Rabbi Elazar was found guilty of treason, so he should have received capital punishment either way.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Korman</a> wrote in his book \"Denominations and Cults in Judaism\" (זרמים וכתות ביהדות), pg. 184, that in his view, the verse \"...It is not for you and us to build a House to our God...\" (Ezra 4:3), which is the Olim's reply to the Samaritans after they requested to join in with the building of the Temple, that the Olim meant that \"there is no we and you - no two Jewish ethnicities. Either you become fully Jewish and embrace our ethnicity and you can build with us, or not - and you can't, and you have no place in the Temple worship\". As we know, the Samaritans refused, which led to many years of strife between the two groups.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We know that Bar Kochba sinned because he failed. Otherwise we would be forced to accept that either the Jewish people were unworthy of freedom or God couldn't actually help him.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shach there (:18) quotes the Levush who states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The reason this is permitted is because] they are Holy Names, and Hashem gave them the ability to be able to perform things through the pious and prophets. One who utilizes them demonstrates the greatness and strength of Hashem. <strong>However he should make sure to delve into them in purity and holiness and for the sake of the Holiness of Hashem, or for the sake of a big mitzvah such as the honour of Shabbos, which we are not capable of doing in these generations,</strong> and even in the time of Yeshaya we find that he was punished for this. <strong>Certainly in our times it is not possible to act in purity and holiness</strong> and Hashem desires a [sincere] heart. This is the words of the Levush, and his words are correct. And similarly we find in several compilations that one should only use the Holy Names for a Holy purpose. [Like it says in Perkey Avos 1:13] דאשתמש בתגא חלף – one who exploits the crown [of Torah for his own ends] shall persish. The Rama wrote to this affect “One who exploits the crown shall perish – some say this refers to one who utilized the Holy Names”. The books of the Kabbalists also explain that it is a big sin to use His Name, therefore one who abstains will be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R’ Chaim Vital writes (Sharey Kedusha Chelek 3 Shaar 6) regarding one who utilizes Kabbalah Maasis nowadays:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We have a tradition that either he or his descendants will become poor, or sick or non-religious”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Means here that the original thing changed form enough to be considered a totally new thing) as to loose their original status of \"Mayim Sheuvin\", as perhaps one can say that \"ice\" is water just in a frozen state (and thus frozen mayim sheuvin are pasul).

As interlocking hands is a sign of harsh judgment, it is improper for a person to intentionally hold his hands in this position. The Ben Ish Hai (Rav Yosef Haim of Baghdad, 1833-1909), in Parashat Pinhas (18), cites this Halacha in the name of the Arizal (Rav Yishak Luria of Safed, 1534-1572). This is mentioned in other sources, as well, including the Sefer Ha’hasidim (by Rabbenu Yehuda Ha’hasid, Germany, d. 1217) and the Kaf Ha’haim (Rav Yaakob Haim Sofer, Baghdad-Israel, 1870-1939).

He will be well-versed in Jewish law, and observant of its commandments (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15942#v=2\">Isaiah 11:2-5</a>). He will be a great judge, who makes righteous decisions (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16030#v=15\">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). Tradition holds, also, that a messiah is born in every generation and that whether or not his identity is revealed is dependent upon whether we merit his coming. R. Ovadiah of Bartenura, Commentary on Ruth. Moreover, the mashiach will bring about the political and spiritual redemption of the Jewish people by bringing us back to Israel and restoring Jerusalem (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15942#v=11\">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>; <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16020#v=8\">Jeremiah 23:8</a>; 30:3; <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16157#v=4\">Hosea 3:4-5</a>).

If we are worthy of the Messianic Era before the End of Days, then we will get there without war.  If we can't make ourselves worthy by then, then we will experience war and the bitter loss of life that the Talmud compared to the refinement of ore into precious metal that will purify us for the Messianic Era (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=112b&format=pdf\">Babyl.

And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<br>\n  <strong>27</strong> And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.'<br>\n  <strong>28</strong> And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question is a good one, because it doesn't seem perfectly clear from the above verses whether the Levites never sinned or if they quickly realized their error and aligned themselves with G-d and Moses when Moses issued his call.</p>\n\n<p>One possible inference is that, since only about 3,000 people were slain, that means only about 3,000 people sinned.  According to the Malbim (<a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/article/parshat_ki_tisa_3#.UTpFeHdtx8E\">cited here</a>), only a small number (the 3,000?) of Bnei Yisrael actually sinned, but the majority of the sinners were killed by plague (See Ex. 32:35), and those were members of the <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/perceptions/5770/kisisa.html\">'Erev Rav</a>, the bandwagon jumpers, so to speak, who had joined Bnei Yisrael when they saw what was going on around them in Egypt during the miracles of the Exodus.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, traditionally we understand the story as being something that the men engaged in, not the women, and in fact the men took the jewelry that the women were wearing, against their wishes, and threw it into the fire to make the calf.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't <em>seem</em> like absolutely everyone sinned, but we have been punished collectively, on different levels, throughout history, in connection with this incident. It <em>does seem</em>, then, that some level of guilt is carried by the Jewish People as a whole.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi says in his commentary on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14126&st=&pgnum=538\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 32:20</a> there were different punishments for different levels of sin. People who were warned before witnesses were killed by the sword, as was done by an Idolatrous city, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0513.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 13</a>:16). Others who acted before witnesses without warning were killed in a plague, (Ex. 32:35). Others who acted without witness or warning were given the water with the calf's ashes to drink, and had their stomachs burst if they were guilty, like the sotah, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0405.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Num. 5</a>:27).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Based on this, all manner of sin here resulted in death. Since our nation is still extant, it seems evident that we did not all worship the golden calf.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Correcting tav/sav\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone who usually pronounces the letter \"ת\" without a dagesh as \"sav\" is leining Torah, and he accidentally says \"tav\" in a place where he would normally say \"sav\", should the gabbai correct him?  </p>\n\n<p>Does it make a difference whether the word with the \"ת\" replaced by a \"ט\" means something totally different?  Perhaps that doesn't even make a difference at all because by saying \"tav\" instead of \"sav,\" the leiner indicates that he thinks that the letter is different from what it actually is.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Contrary to what the previous answer states, there <em>can</em> be a phonemic difference in many of these instances. If one pronounces an unaspirated /bet/ as a /waw/, for example, it might be mistaken for a conjunctive; if one usually differentiates between a /tav/ and a /sav/, the use of the former in a situation where the previous word sounds as though it concludes with a /ha/ might be mistaken for indicating the presence of a definite article. But just because an individual within the congregation might be confused, that is insufficient reason to make the baal qoreh repeat what he has leyned.</p>\n<p>The following summarises my reasoning in this matter:</p>\n<p>The most stringent position when it comes to this issue appears to originate in what the Rambam wrote (Hilkhot Tefillah 12:6). There, he rules that if the baal qoreh errs even in the pronunciation of a single letter (אפילו בדקדוק אות אחת), we make him go back and read it again properly. It is difficult to source the origin of this ruling: Hagahot Maimoniyot learns it out from the beginning of the fourth perek in Yerushalmi Megillah, where such stringency is taken as regards the pronunciation of the targum, while the Kesef Mishna suggests that it is something that can be inferred only, and from Yerushalmi Megillah 2:2 instead.</p>\n<p>Either way, while the Tur mentions the Rambam's ruling (OC 142), he actually sides in favour of a midrash in Shir haShirim Rabbah 2:13, that even if one were to omit a letter altogether - although without changing the meaning of the word - we do not make him repeat it. Such is <em>not</em> the interpretation of everybody on this midrash (a midrash that, read this way, might also allow us to substitute one word for another during leyning; see, for example, the Arukh haShulchan OC 142:2). It is also not the opinion of the Bet Yosef.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh (OC 142:1) rules like the Rambam: \"קרא וטעה אפילו בדקדוק אות אחת מחזירין אותו\" in adopting the more stringent position, although without defining what might constitute such an alteration. Another post-Rambam source for this opinion is the Maharam Mintz (Shut 81). Note, however, the stipulation of the Rama:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודוקא שינוי שמשתנה על-יד-זה הענין אבל אם טעה בנגינת הטעם או בניקוד אין\nמחזירין אותו אבל גוערין בו</p>\n<p>Specifically this is if the alteration changes the meaning, but if he\nerred in the trope or in the vocalisation, we rebuke him [presumably\nlater, and in private - as per the Tur] but we don't make him repeat\nit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Magen Avraham (ibid.) explains that an example of vocalisation that changes the meaning would be pronouncing יַעשה (with a <em>patach</em>) as יֵעשה (with a <em>tzere</em>), or חֲלב (with a <em>chataf</em>) as חֵלב (with a <em>tzere</em>), etc. This Magen Avraham is important, since it defines the responses of both the Mishna Berurah and the Arukh haShulchan in their interpretation of the Rama.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berurah (142:6) brings the stringent opinion of the Maharam Mintz to the effect that one should be careful as regards even the placement of stress, but when it comes to the issue of needing to repeat one's words after making an error, he sides with the Rama (142:4) in that this only needs to happen in the event that the alteration changes the meaning, and adds to this the opinion of the Shulchan Atzei Shittim that this is also the case if he errs in the trope and, in so doing, alters the division of the passuk in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan likewise brings the opinion of the Rama, although adds that this is the case even if one is reading for oneself and not for the congregation. His conclusion (142:5) is important to the specific issue being asked here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל זה בדיעבד, אבל לכתחלה החיוב על הקורא לקרא בטעמים ובדקדוק כדת\nוכהלכה שלא יניח הנע ולא יניע הנח וישמור דגושים ורפויים</p>\n<p>This is all after the fact, but <em>ab initio</em> the person leyning has an\nobligation to read with the [exact] trope and the [exact]\npronunciation, in accordance with custom and law, neither to elide a\nvocal <em>shva</em> nor to accentuate a silent <em>shva</em>, <strong>and to protect both\naspirated and unaspirated consonants</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This statement of his is sourced in the Bet Yosef (Tur OC 142), in which the Bet Yosef relates stringency in this regard to the supposition that even the eccentricities of the Tiberian masorah have a source in the supernal realms. Importantly, however, the Arukh haShulchan rules that punctiliousness in their pronunciation is an <em>ab initio</em> matter (לכתחלה), and that one need not worry about them after the fact.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>\n<p>From the foregoing it seems apparent to me that there is scope to be lenient and to suggest that there are different types of changes that can be made to the pronunciation of the text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Elision of letters and the substitution of words: a small minority of poskim (such as the Tur, based on a midrash) might allow this, under certain circumstances, to slide. The overwhelming majority of poskim would demand a reread;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Mispronunciation of vowels: in the event that the mispronunciation doesn't change the meaning of the word, there is scope to be lenient and to merely reprove the baal qoreh afterwards and in private; in the event that it does change the meaning, there is good precedent to demand a reread;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Mispronunciation of trope: in the event that the mispronunciation changes the meaning, there is some small precedent to demand a reread; in the event that it does not change the meaning, there appears to be no reason to do so;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Mispronunciation of a <em>shva</em> or of an aspirant [eg: <strong>pronouncing the taf as a saf and vice versa</strong>]: there is good precedent to suggest that one needs to careful with these things at the outset, but I have found no precedent in favour of correcting a person after the fact.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>--</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The foregoing is based solely on what I have seen in the\nabove-mentioned sections of the Rambam, the Tur, the Shulchan Arukh,\nthe Mishna Berurah and the Arukh haShulchan, as well as in a small\nselection of their respective commentaries. I have not taken into\nconsideration laws pertaining to the shaliach tzibbur, the leyning of\nthe megillah or the voluminous responsa on any of these issues. As in\nall situations, CYLR.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am not an authority on this, but my understanding is that we do not correct errors related to daghesh qal in (or not in) BGD KPT because (a) there is no phonemic difference, (b) people know that sometimes the same word has a taw and elsewhere a thaw (sav) or a beth and elsewhere a veth and so they would not assume it's a different word from what it is.<br>\nBtw, many Sephardi/Mizrahi communities pronounce beth without daghesh just like beth with daghesh.  Some distinguish gimel from ghimel, daledh from dhaledh, thaw from taw; and some don't.</p>\n\n\n",

This individual, whose name is given as \"Berman\", wanted to come to synagogue on Shabbat and Holidays. During the summer, there were large fixed boats/platforms in the river to cross it, but these were removed in the winter to avoid damage from ice. The only way to cross the river during the winter was by paying a small boat to take you across. The question Mr. Berman asked was can he pay a boatman before Shabbat to take him across the Rhine so he could pray with a Minyan and hear the Torah reading. Rabbi Bachrach prohibited him from doing so, basing himself on the rabbinic restriction on riding in a boat on Shabbat (Mishna Beitza 5:2) which the Mishna even prohibits doing in order to get a Shofar on Rosh haShana (Mishna Rosh haShana 4:8). Accordingly, Rabbi Bachrach prohibited Mr. Berman from crossing the river by boat even if it meant missing hearing Shofar on Rosh haShana.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are the commandments for Rosh Chodesh and Passover in the same paragraph?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The reading for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Shabbat#Shabbat_HaChodesh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parashat Hachodesh</a> consists of a single paragraph in the Torah, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0212.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 12:1-20</a>, whose main topic is God's commandments related to the Passover offering and holiday observance that would be coming two weeks later, when He would take the Jews out of Egypt. First, however, there is one verse (12:2) that give the commandments to observe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Chodesh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosh Chodesh</a> upon observing the new moon and to count <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisan\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nisan</a> as the first Jewish month. These two topics are part of the same speech from God to Moshe and Aharon, without any strong indication, such as a new \"And God said,\" that there's a change of topic.</p>\n\n<p>Why are these commandments mixed together in the same stream of prophecy and in the same paragraph in the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As others have answered, technically the establishment of the calendar is a prerequisite for observing the Jewish holidays.  This commandment is in fact the first mitzva given to the Jewish people as a nation.  (The few mitzvot recorded in Bereishit were given to individuals before we became a nation.)</p>\n\n<p>The Seforno explains that setting the Jewish calendar represents taking control of our own time.  Now that we are about to become free from Egyptian slavery, we are masters of our own time, rather than having our time controlled by the Egyptian taskmasters:</p>\n\n<p>\"החודש הזה לכם ראש חדשים\":</p>\n\n<p>מכאן ואילך יהיו חדשים שלכם לעשות בהם כרצונכם.</p>\n\n<p>\"ראשון הוא לכם לחדשי השנה\":</p>\n\n<p>כי בו התחיל מציאותכם הבחיריי.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=151\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kli Yekar</a> explains that Nissan is the month when the sun is in the constellation <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aries_%28constellation%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aries</a>, a sheep. We know the Egyptians worshiped sheep (Genesis 46:34 and Exodus 8:22). By slaughtering a sheep in the month of the sheep, God was showing the Egyptians his power over their gods. This connection also helps us understand how counting Nissan (the month of the sheep) as the first month helps us remember the Exodus.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34553&st=&pgnum=102\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra (ad loc.)</a> writes that without the commandment to set the months, we would observe the holidays by season (e.g. shamor es chodesh ha'aviv, v'chag hakatzir bikkurei ma'asecha, etc.). However, setting the halachic calendar is an intrinsic part of the holidays, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26956/why-are-the-commandments-for-rosh-chodesh-and-passover-in-the-same-paragraph#comment62329_26956\">as mentioned by DoubleAA</a>, so the commandment of \"hachodesh hazeh\" is appropriately placed with the first instance of holiday related commands. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Ibn Ezra writes that the centrality of y'tzias mitzrayim in terms of the many mitzvos dependent upon it makes it appropriate for Nisan to be the head of the months. This connection makes the placement of \"hachodesh hazeh\" contextually appropriate.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8172/showrashi/true#v14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 8:14</a>) tells us that is because the flood was a complete solar year. Later (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8172/showrashi/true#v22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 8:22</a>), Rashi tells us that the Heavenly bodies did not function the whole year.</p>\n\n<p>If so, how did the date jump from the 17th to the 27th? This is not a question of the passage of time (that was asked in the question linked to above). I'm asking a practical question. The lunar date is determined by the position of the moon, in other words, where it is in position to the sun. If all the heavenly bodies did not move for the whole year, the day after the flood ended should have been the 18th of the month, not the 27th.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi does not say that there was no day and night, but rather that they were not distinguishable (לא ניכר).</p>\n\n<p>Rashi also does not say the constellations did not move, but rather that they could not be used (שלא שמשו).</p>\n\n<p>The only thing that makes sense here is that everything continued to move, but because of the fury of the storm it was impossible to see the sky, and everything was dark for the entire year.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi add the meaning \"luminous gemstone\" to צֹהַר for this exact reason: The sky was overcast and dark, so a skylight would not work. <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sichos-in-english/33/19.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sichos-in-english/33/19.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14004&st=&pgnum=63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mizrachi (8:22)</a> says that the sun and moon still orbited, and when Rashi says \"Lo Shimshu\" it means the sun and moon did not give off light, but they still continued moving. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14004&st=&pgnum=64\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He is later left</a> trying to understand how Noach knew what day it was, how the Dove was expected to find a place to rest, and why Noach built a window in the Ark, according to the opinion that it was a window).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19148&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Maskil LeDavid explains</a> exactly the opposite. He says that \"Lo Shimshu\" means they didn't move, but they still gave light. Since the Flood started in the morning, both the sun and moon were visible in the sky, and they stayed that way for the duration of the flood. Noach used the window to see what was going on in the Ark.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Mizrachi we can understand how the flood ended on the 27th, but we're left with several unanswered question. According to the Maskil LeDavid we can answer the Mizrachi's questions, but we're left trying to understand why the Flood didn't end on the 18th.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can answer this by combining the two opinions. When the flood started the sun stood still, but still functioned, and there remained light for the duration of the flood. Because the sun was shining, the moon was not visible at all and during the whole year the moon kept its orbit. However, since the moon was not visible during the whole year, it was as if it wasn't functioning, \"Lo Shimshu\". There was no visible passage of dates, but Noach had signs to determine night and day (as the Maskil LeDavid says, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11502/603\">here</a>). Thus, when the flood ended and the sun set, that night the moon was in the position of the 27th of Cheshvan, since it had kept moving the whole time. </p>\n\n<p>\"Lo Shimshu\" means different things for the sun and moon, the sun stopped moving and as a result, the moon stopped shining.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are a couple problems with this answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This answer is like none of the opinions I've seen.</p></li>\n<li><p>It would mean that all the heavenly bodies stopped, with the moon being the only exception. Why should the moon act differently than the other heavenly bodies?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

The Mechilta there deduces from the superfluous word \"they shall eat it\", that even if one does not have Matza or Maror, he should still eat the Korban Pesach. Thus, the verse is emphasizing how each Mitzva is independent, the opposite to the point Hillel wants to make. Additionally, the simple reading of the verse seems to be (as the Ramban there renders it) that only the Maror needs to be eaten with the Pesach but there is no evidence that the Matza must as well. It is only from the later verse regarding Pesach Sheini that we derive this obligation, which we apply to Pesach Rishon as well.</p>\n\n<p>[He notes at the end that there are those who have an alternate text that substitutes the verse from Pesach Rishon].</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51449&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher</a> deals with this question at great length in Torah Shleima (vol. 11 pg. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51449&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">97</a>-100, and pg. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51449&st=&pgnum=221\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">210</a>-213). From a quick glance through it, it seems as if he tries to prove that the correct text should cite the verse from Pesach Rishon.</p>\n\n<p>One of the Belzer Rebbes (quoted in Hagadas Kol Yehudah) explained that the words \"לקיים מה שנאמר\" (to fulfill that which is written) are not merely coming to bring Scriptural evidence to the previous statement (for if so it should have used the more common expression \"כמו שכתוב\" - \"as it is written\"). It is also a prayer that we should speedily merit to <em>fulfill</em> that which is written with an actual Korban Pesach when Moshiach comes. Being that we already missed the first Korban Pesach, we pray that we should at least make it in time for the Pesach Sheini (and not have to wait a full year), and thus we bring a verse regarding the Pesach Sheini.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>we are sitting by the seder and pesach rishon has passed so we say this passuk as a tefilah that at least we should be zoche to pesach sheni.

We excerpt from MBY Archives 305:18-20\n  Allowing one’s animal to rest (part 3) – Hey, that’s a (black) hat\n  trick! “The solution is to milk in such a way that only a\n  rabbinically-forbidden act is done, which will be overridden by the\n  principle of ‘tza’ar ba’alei chaim d’oaraisa’.

(Note: The former is not a Torah-prohibited act, because\n  the intended purpose of ‘mefareik’ – i.e. extracting the milk for its\n  consumption - is not realized; the latter is not technically the\n  melacha of ‘mefareik’ either, because, since the liquid is transferred\n  directly back into a solid, the act of “extracting liquid from solid”\n  is not accomplished.) In this way, only a ‘shvus d’shvus’ – i.e. one\n  rabbinic prohibition, namely instructing a non-Jew to do another\n  rabbinic prohibition (non-melacha milking) is being done! b) The Jew\n  himself may express the milk in one of the rabbinically-prohibited\n  methods mentioned above. As stated above, when necessary, a rabbinic\n  law may be overridden for the sake of ‘tza’ar ba’alei chaim’. c) Have\n  a non-Jew milk the animal in the normal way – i.e. collecting the\n  liquid milk in a container. Although the milking method is a melacha,\n  having the non-Jew doing it (which is a rabbinic prohibition) is\n  permissible for the sake of ‘tza’ar ba’alei chaim’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Was the place of the sanctuary of Jeroboam, and they had control of it until the exile, or is it a different Beis El? I don't find anything about this in the meforshim (yet).\nThanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Bible reports that in his wars against Jeroboam, Abijam succeeded in capturing the city of Beth El from the Kingdom of Israel, but Abijam himself died in a plague (II Chon. 13:19). One of the reasons traditionally given for Abijam’s early death is that he did not put a stop to the idolatrous cult at Beth El when the city came under his control (see JT <em>Yevamos</em> 16:3, <em>Midrash Shmuel</em> (§18), and <em>Bereishis Rabbah</em> (§65:20), cited by Malbim (to II Chron. 13:19). </p>\n\n<p>Even though Abijam, king of Judah, captured Beth El from Jeroboam, it seems that through most of the period of Kings, Beth El belonged to the Kingdom of Israel, not to Judah. Indeed, the prophecies of Hosea and Amos castigate the Kingdom of Israel for their idolatrous site at Beth El, not the Kingdom of Judah. This would imply that even though Abjiam captured Beth El from the Kingdom of Israel, Israel later regained that city. However, Israel's recapturing Beth El is not mentioned explicitly in the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>R. Shaul Goldman argues that the Bible's account of Abijam's death implies that his death brought about a temporary cessation in the fighting between Judah and Israel, with Israel gaining the upper hand. Given this understanding, he suggests that upon Abijam's death, the Kingdom of Judah lost the city of Beth El to the Kingdom of Israel. Similarly, R. Shamai Ostreicher argues that when the Bible attests to continuous wars between Judah and Israel in the respective reigns of Asa and Baasa (I Kgs. 15:16; 15:32), this means that the city of Beth El changed hands then and returned to the Kingdom of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, rabbinic tradition about Abijam implies that Beth El returned to the Kingdom of Israel during or before Asa's reign. As mentioned above, tradition explains that Abijam was smitten with a plague as retribution for his failure to destroy the Golden Calf at Beth El, which continued tp survive for many generations until the fall of the Kingdom of Israel. If the city of Beth El remained in Judah's hands for longer than Abijam's reign, then Abijam's successor Asa should also have been criticized for allowing the Golden Calf to remain. The absence of such criticism against Asa in rabbinic literature thus implies that by the time he ascended the throne (or at least very early into his reign), the city of Beth El was no longer under his control and he could not be held responsible for the idolatry of the Kingdom of Israel.\nR. Matisyahu Strashun (1817–1885) writes in <em>Matas Yah</em> (to <em>Bereishis Rabbah</em> §65:5) that even when Beth El was under Judah's control, the deviant practices performed there were always sponsored by the Kingdom of Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Apparently what happened was NOT a capture but only a siege of Beth El. In fact the king Aviya was punished for several reasons through early death, with on e of the reasons being that he besieged Beth El by did not destroy the egels, which I assume also means the altars used to sacrifice there. </p>\n\n\n",

So it would appear that the Chinese were indeed known.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that China is made up seven main people groups, it would really depend on which specific people group you are talking about.  However, if we take the primary people group, the Han Chinese, who are believed to have emigrated north from India, then according to the Table given in the <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11382-nations-and-languages-the-seventy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Encyclopedia based on the various midrashim</a>, they would have been descended from Ham.</p>\n\n<p>Now from a more Arheological perspective, I give you this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heth is the father of the Hittite nation. The Hittites were once\n  regarded by archaeologists as a biblical blunder. Archaeologists said\n  the Bible was absolutely wrong when it mentioned the Hittites, for\n  there was no such people. But since that time, Hittite relics have\n  been discovered in abundance, and scholars are now well aware of the\n  great civilization that flourished under the Hittites. The Hebrew form\n  of this word, Hittite, is Khettai and from this comes the word Cathay,\n  which many of you will recognize as an ancient name for China. Certain\n  of the Hittites migrated eastward and settled in China. Also, another\n  name in this list, the Sinites, is linked with China. It derives from\n  a presumed son of Canaan whose name was Sin. The Sinites migrated\n  eastward until they came into Western China, where they founded the\n  ancient Empire of China and gave their name to the land. There is a\n  direct connection between the word China and the word Sinim, the\n  biblical name for China. (I remember reading as a boy of the\n  Sino-Japanese War, showing how the ancient name still persists.) They\n  pushed eastward and toward the north over the land bridge into Alaska.\n  The Sinites are the people who settled the Americas in prehistoric\n  days and became the ancestors of the Eskimos and Indians who, to this\n  very day, betray their Mongoloid ancestry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By Stedman in his book The Beginnings.  </p>\n\n<p>So I'm going to go with Ham.  Though there is also possibility that at least some of the people groups in China were descendents of Avraham Avinu's sons that he sent east(see Ibn Ezra Beresehit 26:1, and Genesis Rabba 65).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Resuscitation of Aged Nursing Home Patients\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently, there was a story about an 87-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack in a nursing home. The nursing home called 911 and the dispatcher begged the nurse to do CPR on the patient until the paramedics arrived.  The nurse on duty refused as it was against the nursing home's policy.  This policy was <a href=\"http://www.vosizneias.com/125829/2013/03/08/new-york-halachic-analysis-the-case-of-homes-refusal-to-give-cpr-and-the-noahide-laws\" rel=\"noreferrer\">roundly attacked</a> by Orthodox rabbi and educator Rabbi Yair Hoffman who equates the denial of emergency medical treatment to murder.  Rabbi Hoffman's analysis, however, seems at odds with those of Rav Moshe Feinstein who, in his responsa at Iggros Moshe, Choshen Mishpat Pt. 2 No. 73:1, outlines various circumstances in which a terminally-ill patient could be denied medical treatment.  Comparing the two points of view seems to require that we need more information about the original patient, including, whether the patient gave the nursing home advanced instructions not to take drastic measures to save her life -- an instruction commonly known as a \"DNR\" (Do Not Resuscitate) order.</p>\n\n<p>In making decisions about the care of our elderly or terminally-ill family members, especially for those who can't speak for themselves, what information do we need to know before (a) signing up with a nursing home/hospice facility, and (b) speaking to a rav about specific care issues?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I know a lawyer who writes living wills who is close with Rabbi Breitowitz; here's the language I've seen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>RABBI YITZCHAK BREITOWITZ ... HAS DETERMINED THAT ANY LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT, SUCH AS CPR, WHICH MUST BE EMPLOYED IMMEDIATELY TO AVOID DEATH SHALL BE EMPLOYED.  ANY DECISIONS FOR LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT, SUCH AS A RESPIRATOR, THAT DO NOT NEED TO BE EMPLOYED IMMEDIATELY, MAY ONLY BE EMPLOYED AFTER CONSULTATION WITH RABBI BREITOWITZ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I'm not sure everyone agrees to that. As I'd heard from Dr. Fred Rosner, we have two classical cases to work with on this. On the one hand, \"if someone is in the middle of dying, for someone else to push their eyes closed [could accelerate their dying] and is considered murder.\" On the other hand, \"if someone is dying but can't relax because of loud noise outside of wood chopping, we silence the noise.\" Thus -- we don't hasten death, but we also don't prolong it! My impression from Dr. Rosner's talk was that in his opinion, CPR on someone elderly who's already had several heart failures may in fact be considered \"prolonging death\", but that was my impression, and there may be different opinions on this. Dr. Rosner's general approach is that we avoid \"heroics\" when dealing with the terminally ill patient. But \"elderly\" can mean a lot of different things, health-wise.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Herschel Schachter is generally of the opinion that many difficult questions of treatment may actually be up to the patient and have no halachic preference, provided they are \"reasonable.\"  (And if the patient can't be asked, presumably the family has to make their best judgment as to their wishes; Rabbi Kenneth Brander mentions it's surprising how often people say \"I wish they would have stopped treatment.\")</p>\n\n<p>In short, this is a conversation that should be had with the patient, the family, and the rabbi all present. </p>\n\n\n",

The Midrash brings Psukim to show that David Hamelech and Shlomo Hamelech had this same argument, with David saying chochma is in the head and Shlomo saying Chochma is in the heart. The Zayis Raanan there (from the author of Magen Avraham on shulchan aruch orach chaim) points out a difficulty and says David Hamelech held the main chachma is in one's head, but there is some in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>There is further discussion concerning this subject found in the משך חכמה פ׳ בא י׳ב כ׳א. \nHe quotes the midrash and attempts to resolve the dispute by saying feelings such as revenge, resolve, haughty,anger and fear, are all in one's heart, citing psukim as proof. However, logical thoughts such as formations, comparisons,memory are in the head, citing as proof the gemara in shabbos 71 which calls the head the king of all the body parts. He has a long discussion there based on this premise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In reality, I personally don't think that this is a question at all: everyone from the Torah's time period believed in the heart as the source of emotions, so this is how the Torah was written. However, I'm happy to provide a source to this effect. </p>\n\n<p>This issue has indeed been noticed by many people, among them <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Shlomo Fisher</a>, who many would consider to be among the generation's foremost Torah scholars, especially in matters pertaining to theology. He brings up this question in his major work, Beis Yishai (Drashos, pg. 361 n. 4).</p>\n\n<p>First of all, just to help a bit, he says that the Gemara does hint to the fact that the brain was the seat of thought, in Yevamos 9a and Menachos 80b, where someone is derided with the phrase 'it appears that he has no brain (מוח just means soft material) in his skull'. He admits, however, that there are many other instances in Shas where it appears that the Sages believed otherwise. </p>\n\n<p>Second, he says that the fact that the Torah never mentions the brain is totally besides the point, as all of the Medieval sages understood that the \"the Torah speaks in the language of man\", which means, specifically, in the language of the first generation to receive the Torah - and they never knew of the brain's actual function. God first used the Torah to communicate with the generation which received it. </p>\n\n<p>However, he thinks that the fact that the Torah does refer to the heart as the seat of thought/emotion is actually a problem, because the Torah would never promulgate falsehoods, even if they were to have been accepted by everyone in the generation. He then that every prophet received a prophecy that they interpreted according to how they understood the universe. Therefore, even if God may have been giving them a true message, they will interpret it according to their own scientific understanding. Thus, Maimonides insists upon explaining the vision of Ezekiel according to a picture of astronomy that he himself thought to be false, because Ezekiel thought it to be true. </p>\n\n<p>While he doesn't add this caveat, I don't think that R. Shlomo Fisher would say the same thing regarding the prophecy of Moses and the Torah. (Though it would appear that this inaccuracy of referring to the heart as a source for thoughts appears there too) Instead, the second point is probably more accurate: that God gave messages using the common idiom, which was to refer to thoughts as originating in the heart. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The word מוח only turns up once in Tanakh anyway (Job 21:24). It means \"marrow\". Onkelos translates קדקוד in Deut 28:35 as מוח, and we see it with a similar meaning (\"brain\", and the membrane around the brain) in the early rabbinic literature. The fact that it's not mentioned in the Tanakh can be due to their either having a different word for the same thing, or to the fact that it's a part of the body that they never speak about. Either way, they did not consider it the seat of thought.</p>\n\n<p>The first person in recorded history to recognise the brain as the source of thought and understanding was <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Alcmaeon of Croton</a>, a Greek philosopher and physician who lived in the 5th century BCE.</p>\n\n\n",

This title is given only\n  to those Who rejected idolatry, for those who reject idolatry are\n  called “Yehudi.”</p>\n  \n  <p>The daughter of Pharaoh renounced her idolatrous background, and\n  embraced Klal Yisrael, by converting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So does one who reject idolatry become a Yahudi according to the Jews?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>No.  For example, Abraham was not a Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While it is true that one of the necessary components to a proper conversion is a rejection of idols, the talmudic quote presented is not saying that this is the sole method of becoming a Jew. The text on Megilla 13 is arguing about the particular tribal lineage of Mordechai -- he called a Yehudi though he is traced to Benjamin's tribe. So the text attempts to explain the use of the term to label someone outside of his tribe, and explains that in cases where someone is labelled a Yehudi but may not have been of the tribe, it is specifically because that person went through a process of rejecting idolatry. This cannot, then, be expanded to anyone whom the text does not also explicitly call a Yehudi.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No.  The example of the daughter of Phara'oh is a confusing one. I'm not at all an expert in Divrei HaYamim, but it is not nearly as clear as one would expect it to be as a chronicle of the Biblical narrative.  However, I'm not sure that is the correct interpretation of the verse.  If I'm not mistaken, the Yehudiyah in the verse is not the daughter of Phara'oh, although I am having trouble understanding the plain verse itself as well as the commentary on it.  Neither is particularly clear.  I would also suggest that even if one wants to use the verse to support the idea that she was somehow called a \"Jewess\" by the verse, it is because of her good character and possible conversion, not merely because she rejected idolatry.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, remember also that until the Revelation at Sinai, there was not necessarily a clear path to \"conversion\", and she may have aligned herself with Bnei Yisrael in Egypt and/or \"converted\" with everyone at Mount Sinai later.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/461820/jewish/A-Transformed-Identity.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/9248#.UT4D83dtx8E\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for more about the daughter of Phara'oh and her conversion.</p>\n\n\n",

However the Aruch Hashulchan (226:1) notes that in some countries trees begin to bloom in Iyar or Sivan and as such those months would then be the proper time to recite the blessing. The Har Tzvi (O.C. #118) says that if you are in a country where trees bloom earlier than Nissan the blessing can be said earlier.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Lubavitcher Rebbe in Igros Kodesh 23:365 based on the Alter Rebbe's Shulchan Aruch and other poskim like the Kaf HaChaim ad loc hold that it may not be said outside of the month of Nissan and <strong>this is indeed the pashtut of the Gemara</strong> although other Rishonim and poskim like the Ritba (Rabbeinu Yom Tov ben Avraham Elasvili) in his commentary on Tractate Rosh Hashanah (11a) disagree.</p>\n<p>So what about the southern hemisphere?</p>\n<p>Some people want to claim that since the spring is in Tishrei then the blessing may be said at that time in the southern hemisphere. This is indeed the ruling of the Nitei Gavriel (Pesach 6:17).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some claim based on Pesach Hadvir 2:226 that since the Zohar in Parashat Balak 196 says the souls of the upper worlds are found in gardens during the month of Nissan, and through saying the blessing, their souls are elevated, and also since the Talmud states specifically Nissan, hence in a place where the spring is during Tishrei, the blessing may not be said. <strong>This is position of <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/birchas-ilanos/#_ftn14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some Chabad rabbis</a> in the southern hemisphere</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this position does not stand to scrutiny because</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No source such as Gemara or Shulchan Aruch link the blessing to the season of Spring during Nissan, but only to Nissan according to the strict literalist opinion and that's the precise reason why they don't say the blessing in Adar or Iyar although it is also spring time in the northern hemisphere;</li>\n<li>The Zohar says that this redemption of souls takes place during Nissan <strong>and Tishrei</strong>, not just in Nissan, so it can be seen that this kabbalistic effect is not limited to the Spring period as it says in the Zohar:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְיוֹמִין רְשִׁימִין אִית בְּשַׁתָּא, וְאִינּוּן יוֹמֵי נִיסָן,\nוְיוֹמֵי תִּשְׁרֵי, דְּאִינּוּן רוּחִין מְשַׁטְטָן וּפַקְדָן לַאֲתָר\nדְּאִצְטְרִיךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Many poskim explain that Nissan was mentioned in the Shulchan Aruch being it is the common time for blossoming. Hence in truth, the blessing may be said also in other months, by the first sighting of a blossom and it is not a must that it should be during the Spring season as the Mishna Berurah 226:1 says: \"וה\"ה בחודש אחר כל שרואה הלבלוב פעם ראשון מברך, The same applies to any other month: whenever one sees the first budding of trees, they recite the blessing\". Hence, although we may not follow the ruling to say the blessing outside the month of Nissan, but the reasoning behind reveals what is the original intent of the ruling and that it is not necessarily connected to the Spring season.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hence there is no reason even by minhag Chabad and some Kabbalistic poskim not to say the blessing of the trees during Nissan if one can find 1 or 2 blossoming fruit trees in the area where he lives. <strong>The more correct halachic position of other Chabad chasidim who treasure the mitzvot in the southern hemisphere is to go out on the fields as the Gemara says and look for trees blossoming in Nissan and say the blessing</strong> rather than chosing not to say this powerful blessing out of a dubious safek to be makel not to say the blessing.</p>\n<p>For those following the Nitei Gavriel, they are not being yotze according to the strict opinion of saying on Nissan, but they may also rely on the opinion of <a href=\"https://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=1926\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Obadia Yosef</a> that the blessing may be said any time during the year whenever one sees blossoming fruit trees for the first time, and <strong>this is the main opinion outside Chabad circles</strong>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yalkut Yosef 429 writes that in the Southern Hemisphere, one may recite the blessing in the season of Tishri and Cheshvan. He goes so far as to say that if one lives in a climate in the northen hemisphere where the trees blossom before Nissan, and waiting until Nissan will be too late, one may even recite it in Adar.</p>\n\n\n",

It comprises a list of dates on which it is forbidden to fast, or on which it is forbidden to recite a eulogy. There is an accompanying text that scholars term the scholion, which serves as a commentary on Megillat Taanit, describing what happened on each of those days. The text (including the scholion) is so old as to be referred to in the Mishna (eg: Taanit 2:8), and is our earliest source for the story of the miracle on Hanukkah.</p>\n\n<p>If you are asking for information on the oldest <i>text</i> (ie: not which text was composed before all of the others, but which textual remains are, physically, of the greatest antiquity), then the answer would be the material found in the Dura Europos synagogue in Eastern Syria, dating from 244-256 CE. To quote from Stephen Fine, \"a parchment fragment discovered [in Dura Europos] in 1932 is highly reminiscent of rabbinic prayer texts; inscriptions closely parallel Targumic paraphrases of Scripture in Aramaic; and the wall paintings suggest important parallels with midrashic sources.\" [<a href=\"http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Steven_Fine._The_Rehov_Synagogue_Inscriptions:_The_Earliest_Preserved_Text_of_the_Talmudic_Literature.\">source</a>].</p>\n\n<p>While not the oldest, strictly speaking, a very old (and very interesting) example of this phenomenon can be found in the synagogue in Rechov. Dating to the 5th-6th centuries, there is an inscription there that, in the words of Stephen Fine, is the earliest preserved halakhic text yet discovered. The text of the inscription directly parallels passages in Tosefta Shevi'it 4:8-11, Sifre Deuteronomy 51 and Jerusalem Talmud Demai 2:1, 22c-d and Shevi'it 6:1, 36c. According to Prof. Saul Lieberman, it was probably the transcription of a letter sent from a <i>bet din</i> to the synagogue in Rechov, treating of the laws of tithes in the sabbatical year. The full text can be read in English at the same site to which I linked above, which was Stephen Fine's article, \"<a href=\"http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Steven_Fine._The_Rehov_Synagogue_Inscriptions:_The_Earliest_Preserved_Text_of_the_Talmudic_Literature.\">The Rehov Synagogue Inscriptions: The Earliest Preserved Text of the Talmudic Literature</a>\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The idea that it was forbidden to write down the Oral law is a bit of an over simplification.</p>\n\n<p>Students and scribes always wrote down their methods and notes on various issues.  What was forbidden was the collection of these notes into a system of law.  Each person in their own community was meant to seek out the wise people of where they lived and the judges and they were meant to rule based on oral tradition passed on to them.</p>\n\n<p>After the destruction of the second temple, there was fear of people being unable to find for themselves a scribe or wise person to learn from.  Thus we have the creation of the Mishna.</p>\n\n<p>However, Bereitot and Mishnayot were written down and kept individually in the homes of various scribes long before the Mishna was actually compiled and codified.  These smaller notes are known to exist all the way back to the era of the Greek Conquest of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to look at this question is that any nuance of halacha in Tanach would have been oral law until it was written within. So one can argue that the earliest writing down of any oral law would have been when the first book outside of the Humash was transcribed to be made part of the Tanach.  In the eyes of the Halacha however this would not count, since those books are not systemic books of law, rather they just happen to contain some law within them in passing.</p>\n\n<p>Both Samaritan and Kaarite texts where not written until well after the Talmud was published, and there are no existing collections of oral laws predating the Mishna.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, it would appear that the reward for keeping the Torah in Parashat Bechukotai can be understood to be a description of Olam HaBa (without specifically mentioning Techiyat HaMeitim). As Rashi comments on והתהלכתי בתוככם 26:12 - that Hashem will stroll amongst us as in Gan Eden, describing the closeness with Hashem that Ramchal is referring to. (Although, Ramchal, in Derech Hashem, says that Techiyat HaMeitim and Olam HaBa only happen after the physical world first expires and is then rebuilt, which isn't apparent in the pshat of the psukim there.)</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this approach is that this way the world begins with an earthly Gan Eden and culminates with an earthly Gan Eden, giving an additional rationale as to why the Torah began with the story of Gan Eden.

I seem to have forgotten though how to salt it. Can please you explain to me what I should do? Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In all seriousness, though, salting meat was something the vast majority of our great-grandmothers learned at home on Friday mornings. Today very few Jews do it themselves. Can someone explain what needs to be done, as if they were talking to Sara Gittel?</p>\n\n<p>Everyone should of course CYLOR before relying on this if they ever need to salt meat themselves, but I think it is still quite informative to have a feeling for what went/goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Please cover the whole process of salting an entire chicken at home, including different opinions when necessary, but focusing on the more conclusive rulings. An ideal answer will read <em>like</em> a hands-on guide.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The unsalted meat should not come in contact with any kosher food or vessels until the process of salting is completed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step one:</strong> Take the meat and wash it well then soak it in a special vessel (used specifically for this) for a half hour (Rama 69:1). When finished soaking let the water drip off before salting. If using a knife to cut open clots or to just cut up the meat or chicken make sure to have a special knife, do not use your kitchen knife (butcher should have three different knives, Shach 69:3).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step two:</strong>\nTake the meat and salt it with average size salt not too coarse and not too thin (S\"A 69:3) and place it all over the piece of meat try to get every inch (if it is a chicken it should be cut open and salt should be placed inside all over [Misbtzos Zahav 15]). The salt should remain on the meat for one hour (Rama 69:6) and placed on a slanted board with holes so the blood can drip out (make sure to do it over a special vessel to collect blood do not use your sink).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step three:</strong>\nIt has to be rinsed one more time (S\"A 69:7). Before you do that first shake off and rinse the salt off with water (69:7). Then place it in a vessel filled with water and wash it well. Then take out the meat rinse out the vessel, fill it a second time and wash one more time (see Rama 69:7 with achronim especially the Taz and his girsa).</p>\n\n<p>Note: If I left anything out please let me know. Also this is not for psak halacha - that is what a Rov is for.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Something which has actually been skipped is the fact that the water used to wash it and soak it before salting must all be cold. If the meat comes in contact with hot water the halachah is that the blood clots there and leads to halachic problems.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>There is one important step that hasn't been mentioned which starts the entire process.\nTwo candles must be lit and placed at the top of the slanted board on which the chicken/meat\nwill rest. The reason is that in the shtetl, there was not electricity and so one needed candles to see what was being done.</p>\n\n\n",

This command was never fulfilled. Surely, God did not give this command in vain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>We didn't conquer Transjordan, so we didn't make any cities of refuge there.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all of Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches in its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Mashiach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, Israel does none of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Mashiach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, Israel does none of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to serve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: 'I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, Israel does none of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not the redeemer promised by the Torah. Rather, he should be considered as all the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who died.

All the prophets spoke of Mashiach as the redeemer of Israel and their savior who would gather their dispersed and strengthen their observance of the mitzvot. In contrast, Christianity caused the Jews to be slain by the sword, their remnants to be scattered and humbled, the Torah to be altered, and the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the true Messianic king will arise and prove successful, his position becoming exalted and uplifted, they will all return and realize that their ancestors endowed them with a false heritage and their prophets and ancestors caused them to err.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>No, and I'll explain why:\nFirst, as per <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html\">this</a> list, only 42.5% of world Jewry was in Israel in 2010, so \"most\" of the Jews are not in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the exile is a function of lost <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/parsha-insights/5760/sukkos.html\">spirituality</a>, not just physical presence. The return to Zion will end the exile when god decides we are on the spiritual level for the proper return. Simply moving there, while efficacious towards many ends, is not a way to jump over our current spiritual status.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the nation constructed is a modern political entity, not a theocratic kingdom of Israel. Had the messiah already come via the first prime minister, we would have a religious state, not a secular one with aspects of religiosity. (and other aspects of religion would infuse all mankind).</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, the first prime minister was not the messiah because all of the messianic prophecies were not fulfilled through him or during his tenure. Judaism doesn't have a notion of a succession of messiahs who will effect the messianic age. This is to say nothing of the issue of the prime minister's (current or past) personal qualifications towards being the messiah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are many who believe that the State of Israel is the \"beginning of the sprouting of the redemption [ie, the very beginning of the Messianic era],\" and there are those who believe that the State is a sign that we're much further along in the process.  At the very least one could make a strong argument that the \"Exile\" is over, even if the Messianic era itself has not arrived.</p>\n\n<p>Reason to believe that the State is a sign of the Messianic era, if not the era itself, is based on the following sources:</p>\n\n<p><em>Deuteronomy 30:1-5</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When all these things befall you—the blessing and the curse that I have set before you—and you take them to heart amidst the various nations to which the Lord your God has banished you, and you return to the Lord your God, and you and your children heed His command with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin upon you this day, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and take you back in love. He will bring you together again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you. Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you, from there He will fetch you. And the Lord your God will bring you to the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your fathers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Talmud, Berakhot 34b</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Samuel said: There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah except [that in the latter there will be no] bondage of foreign powers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rambam, Laws of Repentance, 9:2</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Messianic age will be [life within the context of] this world, with the world following its natural pattern except that sovereignty will return to Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>R. Tzadok ha-Kohen, “Divrei Soferim”</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yishuv means living in tranquility… that is, as masters of the Land… Only if they are living in the Land in tranquility and domination, for that is called “yishuv.” This was the case in the time that the Temple stood. But once the Temple was destroyed, even though they did not all go out into exile, even those who lived there were not called \"yoshvim of the Land.\" And they had no “yeshiva” there, since they were slaves to the kings of the nations who ruled there, like us who live outside the Land of Israel. This is not called yishuv, but merely sojourning, and there is no fulfillment of \"And you shall settle it (vishavtem).\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>R. Yisrael Yehoshua of Kutna, “Yeshu'ot Malko”</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The essence of the mitzva involves taking possession [of the land] and settling in it like a person on his own property, to conquer the Land of Israel that it be in our possession, and not the empty arrival of today… Nevertheless settlement certainly involves a great mitzva… And there is no doubt that it is a great mitzva, because the ingathering [from the exile] is the beginning of the redemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jews have been gathered from the four corners of the Earth to the Land of Israel; they possess the land (are sovereign over it); and are currently more prosperous and numerous there than they have been in thousands of years.

    "content": "# Is it appropriate for a Gentile to attend and/or participate in a Seder?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The context: last year, I saw this sign that announced the time and place that a Jewish Seder (probably Yom Kippur) would happen. I was definitely curious and considered going and at least observing because as a Christian, my religion has Jewish roots. I ended up not going, mostly out of laziness (I'm a college student, after all), but also somewhat because I didn't know if it was appropriate for me, a Gentile, to observe or participate. Now Passover is coming up and I'm curious again - what is appropriate for me to do as a Gentile at a Seder?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>First, about Yom Kippur: A <em>seder</em>, and Passover, have nothing practical to do with Yom Kippur. Now to your question:</p>\n\n<p>There's nothing <em>wrong</em> with a gentile's attending a <em>seder</em>. Obviously, it would be tactless to bring up Jesus's last supper, or any comparison with Easter. (Moreover, it would go directly against one of the main purposes of the <em>seder</em>, which is the Jewish education of Jews, especially of Jewish children. For the same reason, even though you may see them asking questions, you should save yours for another time, so as to allow them their night.)</p>\n\n<p>That said, I suspect a number of Jews would be rather uncomfortable having a religious Christian, specifically, attending their <em>seder</em>, knowing that he's comparing it in his mind to Jesus's last supper. I doubt that that would apply to other gentiles' attendance.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we're not allowed to invite (or, I think, expect) gentiles to attend a holiday meal. (<em>Mishna B'rura</em> 512:3.) If you show up unannounced, that's fine, but only if you show up after the food is all cooked. (<em>MB</em> :10.) What this means practically for you is that (a) you should show up unannounced. Make sure it's the house of someone you feel comfortable showing up at unannounced, of course. But, also, (b) you should show up after the food is all cooked. I don't know the particulars of this rule — it makes sense to me that you could show up while things are still simmering as long as the active part of the cooking is done, but I'm not sure that that's actually the rule — and you may get turned away at the door (or asked not to eat) for this reason: at a <em>seder</em>, the meal is after quite a bit of other goings-on. (Try not to be offended.)   However, my understanding (no source) is that this rule doesn't apply if the seder is Friday night: that we're allowed to invite gentiles to the meal in that case.</p>\n\n<p>(Added in proof, so to speak: Others have pointed out in comments that at least some hold that one should not give <em>matza</em> to a gentile to eat. (<em>Taz</em>, <em>OC</em> 167:18. Thanks, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1535\">Michoel</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1442\">Fred</a>!) So you'd not get a piece of the <em>matza</em> at the eating-<em>matza</em> parts of the <em>seder</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to bear in mind, though, is that a traditional <em>seder</em> is a good few hours long. <em>I</em> find it interesting and enjoyable, but you may find it boring, in part because much of the discussion (depending on the <em>seder</em> you attend) will assume some prior knowledge, whether of Judaism or of Hebrew, you may not have.</p>\n\n<p>But most of this is just my opinion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses Feinstein</a>, one of the leading twentieth century rabbinic authorities, wrote a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&pgnum=214\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igrot Moshe Y.D. 2:132</a>) from which we can perhaps infer an answer to your question. The case he was dealing with was where a Jewish man had married a Gentile woman who had converted under the auspices of a Reform rabbi. R. Feinstein ruled that the conversion was invalid and that therefore the woman was still absolutely a Gentile. </p>\n\n<p>The question then arose as to what someone should do if his relative who is married to this gentile comes to the Passover <em>seder</em>. R. Feinstein's answer only dealt with the potential issues of teaching Torah to Gentiles and the status of the wine, with not even a hint that there might be an issue with having the gentile present in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Even if R. Feinstein assumed that the querent had no control over the Gentile's presence, you might still expect him to mention it if it was truly an inherent problem. From his silence on this matter we can perhaps infer that in his view there is no inherent issue with a Gentile attending a Passover <em>seder</em>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with a non-Jewish person attending a seder, if all of the food has been cooked in advance of Yom Tov. As stated above any prohibition that might exist has nothing to do with the seder per se, it has to do with restrictions about holiday preparations. There are a zillion reasons to mitigate this prohibition. \nPerhaps a nonJew should not eat the \"afikoman\" as this recalls the Passover sacrifice, which was only shared by Jews and non-Jews (and even some Jews) were not permitted to eat it.</p>\n\n\n",

Even to look at her small finger with the intention of having pleasure from it (See EH\"E Siman 21 Sif 1.)</p>\n\n<p>Is there any prohibition for a woman to look at a man for pleasure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There are two opinions in the medrash cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27100/1442\">Aryeh's answer</a>; R' Yehuda permits women gazing upon men. His opinion is accepted by Sh'muel in B'rachos 48b. Although R' Yochanan follows R' Yosi's interpretation of the pasuk there, the gemara does not record that he added the phrase אם כן עשית בנות ישראל כזונות. In fact, R' Yochanan himself allowed women to gaze upon his handsome countenance (B'rachos 20a, Bava M'tzi'a 84a). </p>\n\n<p>Although the Sefer Chasidim implies that it would be forbidden for a woman to gaze at a man (§614, \"והוא הדין לאשה שלא תשמע קול איש שמכל שהאיש מוזהר אשה מוזהרת\"), this is not generally accepted as halacha. Both R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe EH vol. 1, §69) and R' Ovadia Yosef יבלחט\"א (Yabia Omer OC vol. 1, 6:5) rule that women are permitted to stare at men for aesthetic pleasure as long as they do not fantasize about the man or stare licentiously. </p>\n\n<p>As far as the Sefer HaChinuch quoted in Aryeh's answer, it prohibits women from fantasizing about men other then their husband, but it does not prohibit them from gazing upon other men generally speaking.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Although they're marginal, there are authorities who discuss this.</p>\n<p>In Sefer HaChinuch, at the end of Mitzvah # 188 (קפח):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונוהגת בכל מקום ובכל זמן בזכרים ונקבות. שגם להן אסור להרהר אחר האנשים זולתי בבעליהן, שעליהם ראוי להן להמשיך כל חשקן וחפצן, וכן יעשו בנות ישראל הכשירות. ועובר עליה וקרב אל הערוה קירוב בשר כדי שיהנה ממנה, במזיד ובהתראה לוקה, ואם עבר על שאר הדברים שאסרו זכרונם לברכה להרחקה, כגון השחוק עמהן וקלות ראש, והתרו בו ולא נמנע, מכין אותו מכת מרדות</p>\n<p>[This command] applies in every place, at every time, to men, and to women — for it's forbidden even to them to think about men, except their husbands to whom all their desire should be directed: that is what proper Jewish women do.…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in Yalkut Shimoni, Shmuel I, # 108 (קח):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ליה ר' יוסי אם כן עשית בנות ישראל כזונות והלא כשם שאי אפשר לאיש לזון את עיניו מאשה שאינה ראויה לו כך אי אפשר לאשה לזון את עיניה מאיש שאינו שלה, אלא שלא הגיע עדין השעה שאמר הקב\"ה לשמואל כעת מחר אשלח אליך</p>\n<p>Rabbi Jose said to him, \"If so, you've made Jewish women like prostitutes. Isn't it the case that, just as a man can't sate his eyes with a woman inappropriate for him, so may a woman not sate her eyes with a man not hers?…\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, there are clearly sources that forbid it. The bigger issue here is whether women have the same prohibition of <em>hirhur</em> that men have (which I think deserves its own question). If they don't, there shouldn't be an issue at looking at men - unless, of course, the act of looking at men might cause a stumbling block for men to transgress (but even that sounds tenuous). In any case, neither the Rambam nor the Shulchan Aruch discuss women forbidden to look at men as halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

The answer to this question seemed to be that it is not a mitzvah to attempt to escape capital punishment that is imposed by a Jewish court, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11620/1713\">this answer</a> to a different, but similar, question mentions that the execution serves as atonement for sins committed.</p>\n\n<p>My question is whether it is a mitzvah to attempt to escape the death penalty imposed by a secular government.  Suppose it is a legitimate government (such as the United States), and that the crime is something for which capital punishment could conceivably be considered fair (such as murder).</p>\n\n<p>Normally, it is incumbent on us to protect ourselves from danger. Does this situation invoke that requirement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>We find in Sanhedrin 14a that the government ruled that any one who gives or receives Semicha will be put to death.. Yehudah Ben Bava gave Semicha to 5 students between two cities.. when the Goyim found out, Yehudah Ben Bava told his students: Run</p>\n\n<p>The famous story of Rashbi who ran away in a cave for 12-13 years because the secular courts wanted to kill him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is an interesting question but conceptually should apply outside of non-Jewish courts. If chazal say that death atones and a person has done something for which a Jewish court would conceivably mete out the death sentence (like, in your example, murder) then shouldn't a person seek the atonement if not by a Jewish court then by other means? He could jump into a lions den or commit suicide and say God let my death be an atonement, right? </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case any more than say, administering lashes on yourself (or having another do so) counts as having received malkos beis din. A person cannot chose to punish himself (at least while alive, there are indications that pios individuals asked that the 4 capital punishments of beis din be administered to their corpse). </p>\n\n<p>So, logically we would default to the injunction to \"live by them\" which necessitates a person to do whatever is necessary to stay alive short of violating the three cardinal sins.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am going to say that one should try to avoid the death penalty if at all possible.  There are a great many aveirot for which a Beit Din with the proper sort of semikha(which does not exist today, see Tur Choshen Mishpat 1, and Beit Yosef there). could apply the death penalty under the proper(and extremely difficult to achieve) circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>However the thresh hold for evidence in any secular court today, and especially for capital offense convictions, is considerably lower than that demanded by the Torah.  So while it may, in theory offer a Kappara, at least for that specific sin, it would not necessarily be a Torah mandated death(in fact it probably would not be) and it would not help the person with the rest of their sins(which if our goal is kappara so as to escape the punishments of gehinom, should be considered).</p>\n\n<p>Further to that fact is that the Arizal and the Rashash left us numerous Tikkunim, many of them admittedly arduous, that achieve the same kappara for the various sins, including sins that would carry a capital offense from the Torah, thus somehow satisfying said requirement.  For instance I offer this page from the sefer <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22660&st=&pgnum=169&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benayahu Ben Yehoida by Rav Dweck which gives a partial listing of some tikunim, and follows on the end of a sefer of Tikunim</a>.  Likewise Rav Yedia Raphael Abulafia in his siddur brings, amongst numerous other tikkunim, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21955&st=&pgnum=113&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">a tikkun specifically for a person who has violated an issur for which he would be liable to one of the four deaths meted out by a Beit Din.</a></p>\n\n<p>So I am going to say then that since, the only reason to surrender to a non-Jewish imposed death penalty would be for atonement, and as their are other methods of attaining said atonement, that one should seek to save one's life if at all possible.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What defines \"on this earth\" from a halachic standpoint?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/23402\">Rabbi Ben-Zion Firrer asked whether Torah Law must be observed in space</a>, since Deuteronomy 12:1 says one should follow the Commandments \"all of the days which you are alive on this earth.\"</p>\n\n<p>What defines \"on this earth\" as it relates to the halachic necessity of performing mitzvot? </p>\n\n<p>Presumably the earth's atmosphere would count as \"earth,\" but why? You are not literally \"on [the] earth\" when you are in the atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>And what about Space outside the atmosphere? Do the Commandments not apply there? </p>\n\n<p>From a logical standpoint, it seems absurd that one might be allowed to murder or worship idols while aboard an airplane, or a rocket ship, for that matter. But does halacha itself account for these situations in any reliable way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I could theorize that according to R. Firrer, the 'halakhic Earth' would be defined as anywhere that one is still subject to the Earth's gravitational field. Actually reading <a href=\"http://www.kby.org/english/kiddush-hachodesh/?id=330\">the article</a>, however, implies that either 1. as soon as something is not touching Earth, it is no longer governed by its halachos (which, as you point out, is ridiculous) or 2. anything that has left Earth would still be Earth-bound material until it touches the moon, at which point \"halakhic Earth\" status gives way to \"halakhic moon\" status (maybe you could make kiddush levana upon seeing a person who walked on the moon, until he walks upon Earth...)</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, though, R. Firrer's opinion <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y4SPB17NkzAC&lpg=PA211&dq=J.David%20Bleich%20outer%20space&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=J.David%20Bleich%20outer%20space&f=false\">is quoted by R. J. David Bliech</a> as being 'extreme', and I'm sure that no posek would agree to his \"radical point of view\", including R. Goren, who R. Firrer quotes as saying that <em>time bound</em> commandments are not applicable outside of earth, where there is no measurable time. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, regarding serious discussion of the \"halakhic Earth\" (or \"hashkafic Earth\"), both R. Soloveitchik and R. Yaakov Kamenetsky (Emes L'Yaakov Beraishis 1:1, 5761 edition) have been reported as saying that it includes any reachable part of the physical universe. R. Schachter tells the story that some students came to R. Soloveitchik who were very bothered by the fact that someone could leave Earth and touch the moon, due to the pasuk השמים שמים לה' והארץ נתן לבני אדם - the Heavens belong to Hashem. As this story is quoted in Beis Yitzchak 5754 (<a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2004/12/rabbis-and-traveling-to-moon.html\">translated here</a>), R. Soloveitchik responded</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The term \"heavens\" can be explained in two ways — as something high and/or distant, as it says \"It is not in the heavens\" (Deut. 30:12), according to which the moon is considered a part of the \"heavens.\" Alternatively, the term can be defined as including everything that is beyond human understanding, including the entire spiritual realm. According to this second understanding, the stars and most distant galaxies — and certainly the moon — are considered part of \"earth.\" Therefore, [according to this latter interpretation,] there is no contradiction between traveling in space or scientific studies of the cosmos and the verse \"The heavens are for the Lord and the land for mankind.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way that I heard this story from R. Schachter, he connected it to the words of the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=1&mefaresh=ramban\">Ramban on the first pasuk</a> of the Torah, who says that \"שמים\" in the Torah refers to heavenly beings, but anything that is physical, including everything that is discussed in detail in the first chapter of Beraishis, is included in ארץ. This is what R. Kamenetsky is said to have believed as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We learn from these words of the Ramban [on Gen. 1:1], and in particular from what he concluded in the continuation of his words on verse 8, that everything that exists in the creation in the entire world, including the sun, the moon and all the heavenly hosts, are not called \"heavens.\" The \"heavens\" are only things that have no physical bodies, such as angels, hayos and the merkavah. However, anything that has a physical body is included in the name \"earth\" in verse 1 (<a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2004/12/rabbis-and-traveling-to-moon.html\">translated here too</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is noteworthy because Orlah only applies to the fruit of a tree (and the shomer l'pri, see Brachos 36b). It is permitted to use the parts of a tree that are not the fruit, and therefore if the sap of the tree of Assur because of orlah, it must be considered the fruit of the tree. Seemingly, it would have to be referring to a tree whose main product was the sap. This would be a proof that the bracha should be HaEitz. However, it is not clear if we indeed poskin like Tosfos in Brachos who states that all drinks receive a Shehakol, and therefore the Bracha would be Shehakol.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: The Mishna in Orlah (1:7) cites Rebbi Eliezer's shita that the sap is considered the fruit of the tree. Rebbi Yehoshua (who the halacha is like) disagrees. The Tosfos Yom Tov says that Rebbi Yehoshua disagrees only when the tree produces other fruits, but if it does not, then the sap is considered the fruit. See the Tosfos Yom Tov for a discussion if the Rambam holds like this as well. </p>\n\n<p>However, it is possible that if the maple tree produces no solid fruit it would have the status of an \"אילן סרק\" and the Shulchan Aruch poskins that the fruit of an אילן סרק receives the Bracha of Shehakol.  </p>\n\n\n",

Now, I'm not interested in moving, and there is nothing available in my current community. But suppose I lived in one of the communities that are being promoted and I just wanted a new job, would it be alright to attend under the pretense that I was looking to relocate?  Presumably these communities spent some of their resources to participate in this event, and they are looking to grow their communities, and to that end they send representatives of the community, as well as job recruiters and representatives of local companies, to these events to try to match up prospective candidates with everything they need, ranging from housing to loans to education to jobs.  Would attending this event in order to find a new job (or house!) in the community being showcased be wasting/stealing the community's resources?  Would it be an additional problem if, by succeeding, I prevented a new prospective community member from landing that job or buying that house and thereby prevented the community from growing (not to mention prevented that person from what would amount to a life-improvement)?</p>\n\n<p>Another example I can think of is singles events.  Let's say I was a Shadchan, and I attended a singles event in the hopes of getting some new clients, or at least in the hopes of meeting new candidates for my current clients.

For example, there were different burial areas for those killed by beit din via stoning and those killed by sword.</p>\n<p>\"[...] Those of similar religious and moral stature should be buried next to each other. If, however, a tzaddik and a rasha are buried next to each other, it may not be necessary to move the rasha, although some separation, such as a halachic partition, is usually advised (see Gilyon Maharsha, Yoreh Deah 362:5; Shu”t Chatam Sofer, Yoreh Deah 341; Minchat Yitzchak 6:136; Shevet HaLevi 7:193). [...] Rabbi Shmuel Engel (Shu”t Maharash, 3:65) permitted one to move his wife’s grave when it was discovered that she was mistakenly buried in a section of the cemetery reserved for Shabbat desecraters. [...]\nThus, only in a Jewish cemetery does one find separate burial sections for societies of like-minded individuals.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are these distinctions imposed in today's Jewish cemeteries, and to what extent?

Similarly a fence (or mausoleum, I suppose) would serve as a separation. Lastly, Rabbi Feinstein addresses a category of people (I wonder how many exist today) who are \"eh we don't know what they do on sabbath\" [don't ask don't tell?]. He says you can bury such a person next to either a known-sabbath-keeper or a known-sabbath-violator, thus filling in the empty plots.</p>\n\n<p>Again, practical practices here will vary.

What are the minimum and maximum count of Yamim Tovim days that can fall on Shabbos in a single year (Tishrei-Elul), in and out of Eretz Yisrael?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Let's denote a year by what day is the first day of Rosh Hashanah and what day is the first day of Pesach. So, for example, \"2-3\" means Rosh Hashanah on Monday and Pesach on Tuesday. For our purposes, years run from Tishrei through Elul.</p>\n\n<p>We have to consider the following yomim tovim: <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong>, for which we're provided the day of the week; <strong>Yom Kippur</strong>, which is two \"week\"-days after R\"H; <strong>Succos</strong>, which is on the same day of the week as R\"H; <strong>Shmini Atzeres</strong>, which is also on the same day of the week as R\"H; <strong>Pesach</strong>, which we're provided; <strong>Seventh day of Pesach</strong>, which is first-day Pesach minus one; <strong>Shavuos</strong>, which is first-day Pesach plus one.</p>\n\n<p>Now, for each possible year, I'll provide the R\"H-Pesach numbers, and we'll calculate the rest:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2-3.</strong> Nothing on Shabbos</li>\n<li><strong>2-5.</strong> In Chutz La'aretz, second day of Shavuos is on Shabbos.</li>\n<li><strong>3-5.</strong> same as 2-5.</li>\n<li><strong>5-7.</strong> Yom Kippur is Shabbos, First day Pesach is Shabbos, and in Chutz La'aretz, Eighth day Pesach is Shabbos.</li>\n<li><strong>5-1.</strong> Yom Kippur is Shabbos, Seventh day Pesach is Shabbos.</li>\n<li><strong>7-1.</strong> Rosh Hashanah is Shabbos, Succos is Shabbos, Shmini Atzeres is Shabbos, Seventh day Pesach is Shabbos.</li>\n<li><strong>7-3.</strong> Rosh Hashanah is Shabbos, Succos is Shabbos, Shmini Atzeres is Shabbos.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(The following occur only as leap-years.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2-7.</strong> First day Pesach is Shabbos, and in Chutz La'aretz, Eighth day Pesach is Shabbos.</li>\n<li><strong>3-7</strong>.

In Chutz La'aretz, second day Shavuos is on Shabbos.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, the most possible <em>yomim tovim</em> that occur on Shabbos in one year in Israel is <strong>four</strong>, which happens when R\"H falls on Shabbos and Pesach on Sunday. In Chutz La'aretz, the most is also <strong>four</strong> in the same year and also when Rosh Hashana falls on Shabbos and Pesach on Thursday (which only occurs as a leap year).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In a non-leap year that starts on Monday and has 29 days in <em>Kislev</em>, no <em>yom tov</em> is <em>Shabas</em> in Israel or out of it.

    "content": "# Can God destroy Himself?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was thinking about it lately.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If God can do everything, can He destroy Himself?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is there something about this possibility in any of the holy books?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>This kind of question is addressed by Maimonides in his <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> (3:15), in which he states that we cannot ascribe to God the ability to do that which is impossible, thus, \"it is impossible that God should produce a being like Himself, or annihilate, corporify, or change Himself. The power of God is not assumed to extend to any of these impossibilities.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is important to understand that this does not actually entail any limitation on the power of God (as Maimonides states later). This is because the real issue here is that the questions are fundamentally nonsense. God cannot destroy - or duplicate - Himself any more than He can create a triangle with four corners. The only way we can ask either question is if we fail to understand the meanings of the words we are using.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I believe that this question is based on a premise that illustrates a shallow understanding of what G-d is. The question assumes that the rules of logic are somehow inherently there, and G-d is bound by them. If that would be the case, if we would say that G-d is unlimited then He would be bound to being unlimited, and could not also be limited - because logically something which is unlimited cannot also be limited. Another form that this question often takes is the famous \"Can G-d create a rock so heavy that He can't pick up\". </p>\n\n<p>In fact, not only did G-d create the world, but he created logic too. He is therefore not bound by the constraint of logic. Yes, logically it is not possible to pick up something that is too heavy to pick up - but G-d was the one who made the rock, the concept of heaviness and the rule that something that is too heavy cannot be lifted. So the answer is yes, He could create such a rock, and He could pick it up too. Another example: G-d created a world in which one plus one equals two - He could just as possibly have made a world were one plus one is three.</p>\n\n<p>The is famously expressed in a Kabbalistic work called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_ben_Ezekiel_ibn_Gabbai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avodas Hakodesh</a>\" (Section I, ch. 8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אור אין סוף הוא שלימותא דכולא, כשם שיש לו כח בבלתי בעל גבול כך יש לו כח בגבול, שאם תאמר יש לו כח בבלתי בעל גבול ואין לו כח בגבול הרי אתה מחסר שלימותו ואין סוף הוא שלימותא דכולא - Just as the Infinite One possesses power with an infinite dimension, so too does He possess power with a finite dimension. For if you were to say that He possesses infinite power but not finite power, you would detract from His perfection [for there would be an area, the realm of finitude, that would remain outside the context of G-dliness -- which is impossible], for G-d is the ultimate perfection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, since G-d is the ultimate perfection, there is no advantage that He lacks. In logical terms, two opposite advantages can be mutually exclusive (How can something be limited and unlimited at the same time), but for G-d that is not a constraint. </p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question: Can G-d destroy Himself? G-d possesses any advantage that there might be in being able to self-destroy, but at the same time this does not contradict with His ability to exist forever.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If the siddur qualifies as a \"holy book\", then in אדון עולם it says that Hashem is בלי ראשית בלי תכלית which I would translate as \"without beginning, without end\".</p>\n\n<p>Chief Rabbi Sacks says in his commentary on siddur that \"the siddur is our tutorial in belief\".</p>\n\n<p>Following Derfder's comment below:</p>\n\n<p>The Ramchal starts Derekh Hashem <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38531&st=&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow\">as follows:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every Jew must know that there exists a first Being <strong>without\n  beginning or end</strong> who brought all things into existence and continues\n  to sustain them.

How does this work in neighborhood/town eiruvim?  Does this mean that, somewhere in my neighborhood, every Shabbat there's some communal food that, if I wanted to, I could show up and eat?

There must be at least 6 (some say 8) eggs' worth of Matza, unless there are less than 18 people in the city in which case there needs to be one dried fig's worth per person (Sh\"A OC 368:3). The Matza must belong to everyone. If one person wants to donate Matza to everyone, he must have a non-relative acquire it from him on everyone else's behalf (OC 366:9-10). If anyone does not want anyone else to be allowed to partake of the Matza, the Eruv is invalid (OC 366:5). The Matza must be in a place where one could access it without violating any other Shabbat laws for the entirety of Bein haShemashot (sunset through nightfall) on Friday night, after which is can be consumed (Sh\"A and Rama OC 394:2-3). The custom is to leave the Matza in a synagogue (Rama 366:3). As long as the Matza still exists after a given Shabbat and is still edible, it can be used for any number of subsequent Shabbatot (Sh\"A OC 368:4-5).</p>\n\n\n",

However if it's being done to eat right away then it's muter. The reason it's ossur if not eaten immediately because of the malacha of \"borer\". The Biur Halacha explains however that if peeling is a problem of borer then even to eat immediately should be ossur. He explains that since it's impossible to eat any other way that this because the \"derech achilah\" (way of eating) and is not considered to be like taking the \"poseles m'toch ochel\". See there for more.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what about if a person is peeling an onion by the night of Shabbos to use it in a dish that he will only eat Shabbos day. He wants the onions to be there together with the other food from now in order to absorb the taste more (for example he's mixing together herring with onions, oil, salt and perhaps some other ingredients.) Granted he's only eating it tomorrow but the eating will only start after the dish has been prepared properly. And not that he is \"preparing\" now in a way that it could be eaten right away, on the contrary he can't or doesn't want to eat it now but is only able to do the action of peeling now. </p>\n\n<p>Is this muter to do and would be included in the definition of \"derech achilah\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I had a similar question.

It would be permitted as it is called דרך אכילה - the normal way of eating.</p>\n\n<p>The idea here is that there it is muttar to prepare the food סמוך לסעודה - prior to the meal (which is an extension of the heter of דרך אכילה, which is literally defined as the immediate act of eating - also known as מיד). The poskim disagree as to what exactly defines ״prior to the meal״. The Chazon Ish was of the strict opinion that it is 30 minutes prior to the meal. While Rav Moshe Feinstein believed that any time that is feasibly needed to prepare the meal is called prior to the meal, as long as it is prior to the meal (ie. No break in between, eg. going to Shul after the preparation [Magen Avraham])</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman is mattir because since this food “needs” the time overnight to marinate or take on the taste of the fish or the onion, this is also included in the heter of סמוך לסעודה -  prior to the meal. </p>\n\n<p>However the שו״ת רב פועלים) ח״א ס׳יב) disagrees.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the peeling of the onions in order to sit and marinate with the other foods is meant to enhance the taste in a significant way, thus it would be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>According to the above, it would also be permitted to do borer when taking out a frozen challah for it to thaw out later. Though it depends on ones intention. If you are separating this item to thaw it and you would specifically not do it any earlier then it is mutar. If you just forgot or out of convenience decided to thaw it now then it is <strong>not</strong> considered samuch l’seudah. Based on this rationale it follows that you can remove a food from a mixture in order to heat it up for an upcoming meal since this is an entirely normal part of the preparation process just prior to the meal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I had a similar question, which I asked a well-known posek and mechaber sfarim after he gave a shiur on borer. </p>\n\n<p>My case was about doing borer to take out frozen challa from the freezer long enough before the se'uda so that it could defrost.

However, this was not the ultimate purpose in the creation. Rather, we were created to serve Hashem and not to work for ourselves or for the sake of receiving reward. Therefore they said that it would have been easier and more pleasant had man not been created, although he would have not have obtained such heights, rather than entering this incredible fight with the evil inclination, and if only one could come out as unblemished as when he entered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, certainly it is <em>good</em> that man was created.

Rabbi Lookstein gave the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The event was not an interfaith dialogue or an interfaith meeting.  Rather he viewed his invitation from President Obama -- \"a man of incredible importance to the fate of our holy community\" -- as an invitation to pray with the President.  Because representatives of other religions would be there, \"I felt that the interests of our Orthodox community would be hurt if no one from our community participated.\"  He used the opportunity to remind the President that he had told Israelis in Sderot \"If anybody would shoot rockets into my house while my daughters were sleeping, I would do anything in my power to make sure they wouldn’t do it again.\"</li>\n<li>He said the Shulchan Aruch, at Yoreh Deah 178:2, notes that a person who needs to be close to the government may wear even the Torah-prohibited garments of a gentile in order to represent the Jewish community well.

The reporter asks a question that he has been itching to ask and finally has his chance, but the politician answers a totally different question, delivering his message as he sees fit.  This message then gets printed and publicized.  Why does this work?  Because once a question has been asked, the asker is engaged and is listening for the answer.  It can be any question - why do we eat only Matzah?  Why do we eat only Marror?  Why do we dip twice?  Why do we lean?

So the next generation will have more accurate interpretation, because we all know that all things are subject of interpretation. E.g. if I say now that \"the car is red\" after 2000 years of word to mouth the result would probably be like \"apples taste very good\". So, is something like, \"update\" or \"revision\" possible or not? If not now, do you see the possibility of doing so in 50 or 100 years from now? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Depending on what you mean exactly, the answer is yes and no.</p>\n<p>In terms of the actual canonized text of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TaNa\"Ch</a>, no, it is final and closed.  There are very few instances of deviation between traditional texts, and they are all documented and accounted for.  One example of potential \"changes\" or \"improvements\" actually was discovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls.  There were, in fact, a few noted differences among them.  But that hasn't changed anything.  Why?  Because it's been canonized.  What do we do with these differences?  Not much, honestly.  There are so many possible reasons for the differences that it's impossible to know why they exist.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to The Oxford Companion to Archaeology:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biblical manuscripts from Qumran, which include at least fragments from every book of the Old Testament, except perhaps for the Book of Esther, provide a far older cross section of scriptural tradition than that available to scholars before. While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_sea_scrolls\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>]</p>\n<p>However, there are other texts we have changed throughout history.  In one extreme example, the Meiri was almost totally unknown prior to the 20th Century.  Some more moderate examples are the Frankel edition of the RaMBa\"M's Mishneh Torah, which culls different manuscripts together into one edition, as well as several revisions (some still ongoing) of even such important works as the Shulhan 'Aruch itself.  In addition, the Ba\"Ch, the Vilna Gaon, and others have made textual changes to Talmud, and different textual version of the Talmud are known to have been the basis of certain Halachic disputes among Rishonim.  In fact, the Talmud itself frequently alters the texts of Mishnayoth, in some cases because some have a different version than others, and in some cases simply because the text they have does not reconcile with known oral tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Guinness Beer no longer kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2013/03/hey-vegans-there-may-be-fish-bladder-in-your-guinness/\">new Smithsonian article</a> has discovered Guinness Beer's use of isinglass, a technique that Guinness Beer has confirmed that it does to the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/guinness-fish-bladder_n_2878165.html\">Huffington Post</a>, and even declared \"Guinness Black Lager is not suitable for vegetarians.\"</p>\n\n<p>Isinglass involves mixing the collagen of fish into beer. The collagen usually comes from non-kosher fish (the most common is the non-kosher sturgeon). According to the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isinglass, a gelatine-like substance made from the air-bladders or sounds of fish like the sturgeon is added to cask beers like Guinness to help any remaining yeast and solid particles settle out of the final product. As the finings pass through the beer, they attract themselves to particles in the fermented beer that create an unwanted “haziness” in the final product and form into a jelly-like mass that settles to the bottom of the cask. While beer left untouched will clear on it’s own, isinglass speeds up the process and doesn’t affect the final flavor of the beer once removed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This process sounds very similar to using animal rennet to produce cheese. Now that we know of this process, is Guinness Beer still kosher? </p>\n\n<p>Even if this non-kosher substance is less than 1 in 60 of the rest of the beer, doesn't its essential role to speed up and filter the beer-making process make it a vital ingredient, and thus batel b'shishim does not apply? </p>\n\n<p>Many kosher agencies have previously accepted Guinness to be kosher. For example, <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-appr-liquor.htm\">Star-K</a> specifies \"All unflavored Heineken, Guinness, and Corona\" are kosher. Regarding the issue of isinglass, the <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/faq/faqs.php\">CRC notes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1497&pgnum=73\">Nodah B’yedhudah YD 1:26</a> rules that this does not pose a kashrus concern, and one of his reasons is that such a miniscule amount of isinglass remains in the beer that it is batel (nullified). [In this case there is no concern of bitul issur l’chatchilah – intentionally diluting non-kosher into kosher – because the isinglass is put in with the specific intention of removing it.] Some hashgachos rely on this line of reasoning and others hold that items which are certified as kosher should meet a higher standard and not contain any non-kosher components.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nowadays, most beer companies do not use isinglass and instead use\n  other methods to filter the beer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now that we know a major beer company uses isinglass, which authorities maintain that it wouldn't be kosher?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>I asked this specific question of the Kof-K many years ago.

The isinglas and sediment is never intended to stay in the final product and is removed. The answer was very quick, with no need for research. It struck me that it was well understood and standard policy. Comparing this to the comments above from the CRC and Star-K, it strickes me that this is really a halachic non-issue,</p>\n\n\n",

The Rema rules that if the father is a firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.</p>\n<p>The Sh'vut Ya'akov (1:17) rules that the above-cited custom of the father fasting for the child goes into effect as soon as the child is born, except where the child is born after chatzot ha'laila (halakhic midnight, which generally corresponds to solar midnight) on the 14th of Nisan of that year. (Since the child had not yet been born by the equivalent time that the Plague of the Firstborn had occurred in Egypt, the father need not fast for his child until the following year) The Korban N'tan'el (Pesachim 10:19:80) disagrees. He writes that the custom only goes into effect from the time the child is 30 days old. This relates, again, to the command to redeem the firstborn, which does not go into effect until the child is 30 days old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I understand why we lean (the haggadah tells us that), but why the left in particular?  Is this because of historical practice (maybe couches were asymmetrical)?  Is there a symbolic reason?

(For lefties this would be the opposite. -- <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36400&st=&pgnum=92\" rel=\"nofollow\">Me'iri</a>) It seems this is because you lie on your side on your left, leaving your right hand available for eating with, unlike your left hand which is being lain upon.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud also says to not lean on the right lest your windpipe catch the food instead of your esophagus and you choke. I cannot comment on the specific anatomical details of why this is so.

Most of these are tradition-based: one pronounces it the same way his parent or teacher did, or a close approximation.

Most Ashkenazim, along with Yemenites, pronounce both approximately as \"aw\" in claw, draw.  Some Ashkenazim pronounce qames gadhol as \"aw\" and qames qatan as \"o\".<br>\nGreat confusion has resulted when people from an Ashkenazic background make a partial switch to Modern Hebrew pronunciation.  They often don't know to distinguish qames qatan from qames gadhol, and even if they do don't know which is which.<br>\nOne should note that the rules of qames qatan in Modern Hebrew differ from the Sephardic reading tradition as follows:  a qames preceding hateph-qames is qames-qatan according to Modern Hebrew (e.g., tsohorayim), but is qames gadhol according to Sephardic reading tradition (tsahorayim).<br>\nIt would be a reasonable assumption that where the last-mentioned rule does not apply, someone pronounced qames-qatan as \"a\" is simply making an error. \nThere are, of course, many situations where authorities dispute over a particular qames followed by a shewa as to whether it is qames-qatan followed by shewa nah or qames-gadhol followed by shewa-na`.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>No not really.</p>\n\n<p>Ashkenazi pronunciation of kamatz doesn't exist in american, and is like the British 'o' in 'orange'.

So not like the 'a' in cat.</p>\n\n<p>Sephardi pronunciation of kamatz katan and kamatz gadol is the same as modern israeli.. but the rule of when it is kamatz katan and when it is kamatz gadol is a bit simpler.</p>\n\n<p>Patach in sephardi and modern israeli are same as kamatz gadol.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard that syrians pronounce patach like the 'a' in cat.</p>\n\n<p>There may be a persian pronunciation of kamatz that is worth looking into.

Why do we (at least Ashkenazim) say a new b'racha for each cup at the seder?  I think I've seen an explanation somewhere about them having four different purposes, but I couldn't find it in any of the haggadot I have handy (and I thought that's where I read it).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham (OC 474:1 and similarly in Taz there) explains that each of the four cups is a separate mitzva, and it is therefore considered as if he had in mind specifically not to exempt the other cups with his Brocha. The Pri Megadim adds that it is preferable to actually have this in explicitly in mind. </p>\n\n<p>The Minchas Shlomo (vol. 1 18:6) questions this explanation, for granted that each cup is a separate mitzva but the question was why we make a separate \"hagofen\" for each cup. \"Hagofen\" is not a brocha recited before doing a mitzva (bircas hamitzvos) , but rather a brocha said before eating (bircas hanenen) and so what relevance is there to the fact that each cup is its own mitzva? He explains that because each cup is an independent mitzva, the Sages established that one should not have the subsequent cups in mind while reciting the blessing in order to give each cup it's own importance. See there are length. </p>\n\n<p>The Gra there (quoted by Mishna Berura :4) brings an alternative explanation, that since one may not drink between the first and second cup (after he starts reciting the hagada) this is considered an interruption that requires a new Brocha. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Starting the Seder after Sheki'ah (sunset)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my experience, there is a lot of emphasis on waiting until after Tzeith HaKochavim (the stars come out), which is seen as definitely after nightfall, to start the Seder. We want to make sure that the Mitzvoth of the Seder, and indeed even Kiddush, are done definitely at night. See, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.472.1?with=Mishnah%20Berurah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 472:1:1</a>.</p>\n<p>But I looked at the Shulhan 'Aruch, and even the Raavad. (Perhaps the former is based on the latter.) It seems clear that there's also urgency to start the Seder (or at least the meal) reasonably early. This can help to ensure that participants, and especially the children, don't fall asleep. See OC 472:1 (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14165&st=&pgnum=157&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Heb</a> | <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.472.1?with=Mishnah%20Berurah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eng</a>), and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/27224/5\">this related question</a>. See also RaAVa\"D 7:3 in the RaMBa\"M, Laws of leaven and Matzah (from a friend, no time to look up right now).</p>\n<p>The word used by the Shulhan 'Aruch is \"משתחשך\". The M\"B there says, \"Lav Davka\" (\"not quite\").</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A.) Is the M\"B saying this? \"This doesn't mean quite what you may think it means, so don't mistake the meaning here to think you should start the Seder before nightfall. What is meant here is that you shouldn't wait even later and thereby delay the meal.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>B.) Or is he trying to argue with / alter the Shulhan 'Aruch, and say this? \"We don't necessarily have to follow this exactly. The most important thing is to wait until nightfall, and then once we get to nightfall don't delay further.\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I mean is this: In a place where nightfall is very late, or even if the children will <em>definitely</em> either fall asleep or be irritable and the experience will not be a positive one for them, could (or should) a person begin after sunset but before nightfall?</p>\n<p>If the first interpretation holds, then it seems, according to M\"B, there's no option, and he's clarifying what the Mehaber meant, so that there's no mistake at your or my Seder.</p>\n<p>If the second interpretation holds, though: I might think I can start a little earlier if, in my judgment, the quality of the Seder will be affected. This is because it's important to have the kids awake and participating. And the M\"B is just speaking about an ideal situation where everyone's engaged, or nobody is young enough to be affected much by a late start.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm going to post how I understand the Mishna Berura's comment, and hopefully that will solve your difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch states (OC 472:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יהיה שלחנו ערוך מבעוד יום, כדי לאכול מיד כשתחשך; ואף אם הוא בבית המדרש, יקום מפני שמצוה למהר ולאכול בשביל התינוקות שלא ישנו, אבל לא יאמר קידוש עד שתחשך.‏<br>\n  One's table should be set from before the holiday starts in order that one can eat immediately upon darkness. Even if one is in the study hall, one should leave because it is a Mitzva to hurry and eat so the children won't sleep. But he shouldn't say Kiddush before dark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura (sk 1) comments on the phrase כדי לאכול מיד \"in order that one can eat immediately\" saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‏(א) כדי לאכול מיד - לאו דוקא והכונה כדי שיהיה אפשר לו להתחיל הסדר תיכף משתחשך ולא ישתהה:‏<br>\n  In order that one can <em>eat</em> immediately -- Not precisely, and the intention is that they should be able to begin the Seder immediately after dark, and not tarry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it seems the Mishna Berura is clarifying that when the Shulchan Aruch said \"eat\" at nightfall, he meant \"begin the Seder\" at nightfall, not \"eat the Matza\" or \"eat Shulchan Orech\". He still agrees the whole thing must take place after dark. Looking up the Mishna Berura's referenced source (ShA HaRav OC 472:1) one sees this point explicitly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יהיה שולחנו ערוך מבעוד יום כדי <strong>להתחיל הסדר</strong> מיד כשתחשך ואף אם הוא בבית המדרש יקום מיד כשתחשך שמצוה למהר להתחיל הסדר בשביל התינוקות שלא ישנו והתורה אמרה והגדת לבנך ביום ההוא: ‏<br>\n  One's table should be set from before the holiday starts in order that one can <strong>begin the seder</strong> immediately upon darkness.

So even if he's in the Beit Midrash he should get up because it's a miswah to make haste and eat [i.e start and move along the Seder], for the sake of the children so that they should not sleep.

Only the animal itself is.</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash Tanchuma speaks of fish called the Shibuta which has the same taste as pork.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For each thing that was prohibited, the Lord permitted something else instead. Since He prohibited the flesh of the swine, which is considered so fine, a substitute for it was created: \"I forbade you the flesh of the swine, but I permitted you the tongue of the fish known as shibuta, which is like pork\" (Midrash Tanhuma, Shemini 12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there are no \"non-kosher\" tastes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara says that the Jews complained about those five things because the manna could not taste like any of them. Since in Egypt, the people could eat pork, the implication is that they were not deprived of that taste. The Gemara in Sanhedrin does not contradict this, because the manna tasting like something assur is not actually something assur. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The basic פשט (simple explanation) of the פסוק (verse) is the Manna was \"like coriander seed, it was white and it tasted like a cake fried in honey\".( שמות פרק טז פסוק לא).  </p>\n\n<p>From the verse itself it tasted like cake fried in honey.  </p>\n\n<p>The מדרש comments that you are quoting from Yoma may not have to be taken literally.

What danger? ―the danger of <em>Shavriri</em>. So if he's thirsty, what's his remedy? If there's someone with him, let him tell him \"<em>P'loni</em> son of <em>P'lonis</em>, I thirst for water\"; and if not, let him tell himself \"<em>P'loni</em>, my mother told me 'beware of <em>Shavriri</em>'. <em>Shavriri vriri riri iri ri</em>. I thirst for water in a clear cup.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(It seems from <em>Rashbam</em> on the page that <em>Shavriri</em> is a type of blindness.

How does it do so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In an important responsum on superstition, the Rashba (no. 825) writes the following:</p>\n\n<p>ואי משום דרכי האמורי האמת אמרת שכל שיש בו משום רפואה וידוע לרופאים שהוא כן אין בו משום דרכי האמורי ויתר מזה שכל שלא נאסר בגמרא באותם המנויין בדרכי האמורי אין לנו לאוסרן לפי שאין הסגולות ידיעות ואין לנו לדון מדרכי הטבע המפורסם שהרי יש סגולות שלא נודע עיקרן לכל בעלי הטבע כקמיע של עיקרין וקדירת האבן היריקה הנקראת אם טופסי גם בעשבים גם בלחשים שהתירו חכמים כמו שאמרו בשאר המקומות לימר הכי ולימר הכי <strong>ואין לך רחוק מן הטבע מלחוש שברירי ברירי</strong> ואף על פי כן התירו חכמים ולא היתר בלבד אלא שצוו והזהירו לאומרו מפני סכנה והילכך כל שלא ידענו אם יש בו שום רפואה אם לא מותר אם לא אסרוהו החכמים בהדי אותן ששנינו בגמרא שיש בו משום דרכי האמורי</p>\n\n<p>The basic gist of the responsum is that prohibited superstitions only include those practices that are proven ineffective. (Others seem to imply, that \"segulah\"/non-scientific remedies would be forbidden unless proven effective.) Even if the remedy is unexplainable by nature, such as amulets and incantations, they are permitted. Above he writes that you can't a more (scientifically) far-fetched remedy that the \"Shavriri vriri\" incantation. Still, it's permitted because Chazal have testified that it is effective. (See also responsa 167 & 413, and the Rashba on Chulin 77 and Shabbat 67)</p>\n\n<p>I would infer from the above Rashba, that we have no idea how incantations work. So the answer to your question is \"We don't know\".</p>\n\n<p>Another possible explanation is from the Rambam (Idolatry 11:1):\nמי שנשכו עקרב או נחש מותר ללחוש על מקום הנשיכה ואפילו בשבת, כדי ליישב דעתו ולחזק לבו, אף על פי שאין הדבר מועיל כלום, הואיל ומסוכן הוא, התירו לו כדי שלא תטרף דעתו עליו.</p>\n\n<p>This is a quintessential example of the Rambam's denial of the effectiveness of incantations and other supernatural claims (divination, sorcery etc..). He writes that such incantations may help ease the mind of the (believing) victim so that he doesn't despair or panic. (A modern interpretation that this refers to a placebo effect has been suggested. I'm not so sure.)</p>\n\n<p>(Indeed, the Vilna Gaon famously wrote that the Rambam was seduced by his study of \"cursed\" philosophy when he denied the effectiveness of incantations despite the testimony of Chazal.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My Magid Shiur explained that this creature <em>Shavriri</em> gets alarmed and runs away when it hears its name being shrunk.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the other anti-demon chants mentioned there also seem to be a play on words to frighten away the offending creature.</p>\n\n<p>When you consider that their names describe their essence -- and may be their entire essence, if they are simply a figment of superstitious minds -- then renaming them would disarm them.</p>\n\n<p>(Rav Yitzchak Fruchter, Jerusalem)</p>\n\n\n",

But isn't it possible that God could have given Jewish souls to the children of Jewish fathers, too? And how would the rabbis know if He had??)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>By the way, generally a \"Talmudist\" means someone who studies the Talmud; the rabbis who wrote the Talmud are known as The Sages, Hazal (an acronym for \"our sages of blessed memory\"), or the Tannaim (those before the year 200) and Amoraim (from 200 to 500).</p>\n\n<p>Okay, let's back up here.</p>\n\n<p>The reading of Deuteronomy is a very nuanced one, which your translation is lacking. (In fact your question only arises because you're using a faulty translation.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... do not give your daughter to [the non-Jew's] son, and his daughter do not take for your son. For <strong>he</strong> will make your son veer away from Me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wait -- why would \"he\" affect your son? Shouldn't it be she?</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud observes that elsewhere in the Torah, \"son\" can also mean grandson; therefore it reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... do not give your daughter to a non-Jewish man, or your son to a non-Jewish woman. The non-Jewish father will make your maternal grandson veer away from G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay then we're missing symmetry. What about \"the non-Jewish mother will make your paternal grandson veer away from G-d\"?

But to answer your question more broadly, you're trying to ask a question of metaphysics, which honestly is none of our business.

In theory, if the Sanhedrin was \"off\" by a day, it wouldn't matter - because what they declared would become true.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Chazal's declaration that Judaism passes exclusively through the matrilineal line created that reality.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the disclaimers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do not try this at home.

However, short of that, how far must one go? Must (may) one make oneself sick in order to do a mitzvah? Must one spend so much money in doing a mitzvah that one is reduced to begging thereafter? Must one suffer even the most extreme emotional toll in order to perform a mitzvah?</p>\n\n<p>Does any of this depend on the nature of the mitzvah, or vary for specific (individual) mitzvot? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>\"Rama, Orach Chaim 656:1, rules that one must spend up to one-fifth of his assets on order to fulfill a positive [Biblical] mitzvah and his entire fortune in order not to violate a negative [Biblical] commandment.\" (<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/_lectureShiurText.cfm?shiurId=721717\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>) As for negative commandments that are violated by passivity--such as the commandment that you may not allow someone else to die--there is dispute about whether they are considered \"positive\" or \"negative\" commandments for the purposes of this question. R. Yair Bachrach, in Chavot Yair no. 139, considers this example a positive commandment, which one must spend up to one-fifth of his assets to fulfill, whereas Rivash (no. 387) considers it a negative commandment for which one must spend one's entire fortune.</p>\n\n<p>As for illness: a <em>choleh</em> or sick person is considered exempt from some mitzvot, notably fasting, but Rabbinical opinions seem to vary substantially as to the full extent of a sick person's exemptions from mitzvot. Some opinions are discussed <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/Celiac%20-%20A%20Guide%20to%20Halachic%20Observance%20%28JoHaCS%202010%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Very generally, it seems that a sick person is often exempt from Rabbinical commandments within certain parameters; as for Torah commandments, he may be exempt from certain positive commandments, but rarely negative ones. (CYLOR if it applies to you, of course...)</p>\n\n<p>The question of whether one should make himself ill--including, perhaps, emotional illness--in order to fulfill a commandment is another question of debate, but at least <a href=\"http://drsorotzkin.com/honoring_abusive_parents.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">one authority</a> suggests that \"Since one is not required to spend more than a fifth of his assets for a mitzvas aseh then certainly one is not required to make himself sick.\" Whether it would be permissible to do so (i.e., to make oneself sick in order to perform a mitzvah) is still unclear to me.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>SAH gave an excellent exposition of the laws of mitzvot from the Torah. Rabbinic mitzvot are subject to a more lenient set of laws. While each Rabbinic mitzvah has its own laws - please consult your own LOR, do research, or ask separately - the following things are often considered regarding Rabbinic obligations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hefsed Gadol - a large loss of money</li>\n<li>Tza'ar Gadol/Choleh she'ayn bo sakanah - illness (non life-threatening)</li>\n<li>Kavod Habriyos - embarrassment</li>\n<li>Mitzvah (sometimes one may transgress a Rabbinic prohibition to enable him or the public to perform a mitzvah)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These factors are almost never a consideration in a Mitzvah d'oraysa, a Biblical Mitzvah. They are taken into account for Rabbinic mitzvot, though different Rabbinic mitzvot have their own stringencies and leinencies.</p>\n\n<p>Even when one is not required to fulfill a mitzvah, it is often a meritorious act to do so anyways.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question of whether one must perform a positive commandment even if it will make him sick was addressed by R.

Going with the \"rib\" translation, here are a few explanations.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.18.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 18:2</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי יהושע דסכנין בשם ר' לוי אמר ויבן כתיב, התבונן מאין לבראתה אמר לא אברא אותה מן הראש שלא תהא מיקרת ראשה, לא מן העין שלא תהא סקרנית, ולא מן האוזן שלא תהא צייתנית, ולא מן הפה שלא תהא דברנית, ולא מן הלב שלא תהא קנתנית, ולא מן היד שלא תהא ממשמשנית, ולא מן הרגל שלא תהא פרסנית, אלא ממקום שהוא צנוע באדם אפי' בשעה שאדם עומד ערום אותו המקום מכוסה, ועל כל אבר ואבר שהיה בורא בה היה אומר לה תהא אשה צנועה אשה צנועה, אעפ\"כ (משלי א) ותפרעו כל עצתי, לא בראתי אותה מן הראש, והרי היא מיקרת ראשה שנאמר (ישעיה ג) ותלכנה נטויות גרון, ולא מן העין והרי היא סקרנית שנאמר (שם /ישעיהו ג'/) ומסקרות עינים, ולא מן האוזן והרי היא צייתנית שנאמר (בראשית יח) ושרה שומעת פתח האהל, ולא מן הלב והרי היא קנתנית שנאמר (שם /בראשית/ ל) ותקנא רחל באחותה, ולא מן היד והרי היא ממשמשנית שנאמר (שם /בראשית/ לא) ותגנוב רחל את התרפים, ולא מן הרגל והרי היא פרסנית שנאמר (שם /בראשית/ לד) ותצא דינה.</p>\n<p>...He [God] said, \"If I will create her\nfrom the head, she will be lightheaded.

Instead, she should be created from a place that is modest in man even when he is naked and yet is still covered...[then there is more midrash on the body parts man and woman share].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding this midrash the Meam Loez comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything is influenced by the source from which it was created. God\ntherefore arranged things so the woman was not created from any place\nthat would have an adverse influence.</p>\n<p>God wanted woman to be as perfect as possible, and not to have any undesirable traits.

He wanted her to be intrinsically free of all adverse traits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Meam Loez</strong></p>\n<p>The Meam Loez also offers his original (albeit less palatable) opinion as to the reason of the rib:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He [a man] should also realize that woman was created from hard bone; she is therefore hard and stubborn. Man was created from soft earth; he is thus more flexible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Targum Yonathan 2:21-22</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורמא יי אלהים שינתא עמיקתא עלוי אדם ודמך ונסיב חדא מעלעוהי הוא עלעה תליסרית דמן סטר ימינא ואחד בבשרא: ובנא יי אלהים ית עלאה דנסב מן אדם לאיתתא ואתיה לות אדם</p>\n<p>[Man has fifteen ribs on each side.] ...The one that God took to create the woman was the thirteenth rib on the right side.

Yitzchak Ginsburgh</strong></p>\n<p>For a kabbalistic explanation, R. Ginsburg connects the word for rib with womanhood in his <em>The Mystery of Marriage</em> (p. 275):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are three pairs of names for the sun and moon in Hebrew, corresponding to the essential male and female archetypes of the three lower worlds. The combined numerical value of the three names of the moon [<em>yareiach - Beriah, levanah - Yetzirah, sahar - Asiyah</em>] (the female archetype) is 570, which equals 30 x 19, 19 being the value of חוה (Eve). The average value of the three names is 190, which equals צלע (the \"side\" or \"rib\" from which Eve was created); this number is the triangle of 19, Chavah. The average menstrual cycle (עונה בנונית) is 30 days long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

On the one hand, it is part of the Havdallah ritual; on the other hand, the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 297</a>:1) is clear that one need not seek out spices, but rather one uses them if they are available and doesn't if they aren't.</p>\n\n<p>The first person I know of to ask this question is Rabbi Yehuda ben <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalonymus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalonymous</a>, who was anosmic, to <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbeinu Ephraim</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regensburg</a> (recorded in Or Zarua II 92):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואדם שהוא תותרן ואינו מריח אם יכול לברך בורא עצי בשמים כדי להוציא אחרים דבר זה כבר שלח רבי' יהודה בר' קלונימוס בר' משה לרבי' אפרים ואני תותרן ואיני מריח כל עיקר אם הוא ברכה לבטלה שאני מברך על עצי בשמים ואני סומך על הוצאת אחרים י\"ח והשיב לו אדם שאין מריח ומברך לעצמו על הבשמים יברכה לבטלה היא ואם להוציא ב\"ב אינו יכול ולא דמי לקידוש והבדלה וברכת לחם ומצה דהוו חובה ומצוה אבל בשמים אינו אלא מנהג:‏<br>\n  One who is anosmic and cannot smell, can he say the blessing on spices for others? This was already sent by Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Kalonymus son of Rabbi Moshe to Rabbeinu Ephraim, \"I am anosmic and cannot smell at all.

Additionally, he cannot rely on exempting his household, for this is not similar to [Hagefen by] Kiddush and Havdallah or [Hamotzi on] bread [of Sabbath meals?] or on Matza, for those are obligatory whereas the spices are only a custom.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tur (OC 297) quotes his father, Rosh, who argues based on the continuation of the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">RH 29</a>) mentioned above which permits saying Hamotzi for one's children \"in order to educate them in Mitzvot\". So too here, Rosh concludes, where there also is no obligation one can exempt his family.</p>\n\n<p>This position is limited by Rabbis <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel_Sirkes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoel Sirkes</a> (Bach) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yosef Karo</a> (Beit Yosef) there to where the children are minors of educable age, parallel seemingly to the case of the bread from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">RH 29</a>. R Karo however, goes on to posit that Rosh's ruling is correct because saying a blessing on spices at Havdallah is an established enough custom to grant it mitzva-component status, similar to Kiddush and Matza at the Seder. Accordingly, he rules as such in his Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 297</a>:5).</p>\n\n<p>This innovation of his though is not accepted by most later authorities. Taz and Magen Avraham note that the Shulchan Aruch elsewhere (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A1%D7%96#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.9B\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 167:20</a>) rules that the Hamotzi of Sabbath meals (which are seemingly more obligatory than spices at Havdallah) do not have the mitzva-component status. The Gra too seems to reject this. Rabbi Akiva Eiger (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49352&st=&pgnum=64\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) suggests that even if it is a mitzva, an anosmic is excluded from that mitzva and can't exempt anyone with its blessing. Both Aruch haShulchan and Mishna Berura seem to accept this criticism. Accordingly, it would seem prudent for an anosmic to avoid making the blessing for others (and certainly not for himself), with room to be lenient for one's own minor children.</p>\n\n<p>Two other views in Rishonim:</p>\n\n<p>Orchot Chayim (quoted in Beit Yosef) rules that an anosmic can make a blessing on smells always because they benefit his body even if he doesn't feel it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirna\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer Minhagim (Tyrnau)</a> (Motzash 7, quoted in Magen Avraham) rules that an anosmic can make the blessing on spices at havdallah because he too benefits from smells, because others can warn him of approaching fires based on smells. [A very unique position; compare to Bavli Megillah 24.]</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That said, I had a chavrusa for many years who was born anosmic like his father. He reported to me that his father said the blessing for the whole family weekly.</p>\n\n<p>Also worth noting (because you mentioned it) that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Joseph_David_Azulai\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hid\"a</a> (Yosif Ometz 17) rules against Rosh, but permits saying the blessing for one's minor children if one is only temporarily unable to smell because of a cold.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Problems with the kashrut of todays machine matzot",
    "content": "# Problems with the kashrut of todays machine matzot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read a disturbing article by Rav Menahem Eizenberg in Techumin (26, page 123). The one of the many issues raised in the article is that the hechser for machine mazah does not apply to today's machines which are very different that those delineated in halacha. Specifically, today's matzas are baked for two minutes on a conveyer belt that begins on a very low temperature (Hand matzot are baked in a very hot oven for 15-30 seconds). This process he claims, and goes on to prove quite well in my opinion, causes the matzots to be chametz beyond reasonable doubt. Tchumin has another article, which is a letter of endorsement of this article from Rav B\"Z Yaakov Vasner who basically says: machine matzah is chametz.\nSo my question is, do you know of any literature on the subject (this was written over 15 years ago). Do you know any other opinions that argue this case.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the full article:\n<a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=257&ArticleID=321&Page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=257&ArticleID=321&Page=1</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is an insufficient response i found:\n<a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=257&ArticleID=322&Page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=257&ArticleID=322&Page=1</a></p>\n\n<p>I spoke to Rav Machpood* last night. He thinks that the fact that the matzot are in the oven the whole time is enough. but if you look in the article I think he shows that that is an insufficient argument.</p>\n\n<p>[*] A very big rabbi in the Kashrut sector in Israel: <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%93</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The greatest argument against what you are saying is from the Shulhan Arukh itself, namely <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&st=&pgnum=110\">OC 459:2 which says:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יניחו העסה בלא עסק ואפילו רגע אחד, וכל זמן שמתעסקים בו, אפילו כל\n  היום, אינו מחמיץ ואם הניחו בלא עסק שעור מיל הוע חמץ, ושעור מיל הוע\n  רביעית שעה Do not allow the the dough to sit without working it for\n  even a minute, and all the time that one is working it, even all day,\n  it will not become chametz, and if it was let sit for without working\n  for for time of mil it is hametz, and the time of a mil is a quarter\n  hour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also see the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&st=&pgnum=119\">Shulhan Arukh OC 461:3</a> and the adjoining Mishnah Berura that explain that the Matzah, so long as it is not removed from the oven, may bake for up to a shiur mil without worry of it becoming Hametz.  Which is precisely why we are not allowed make matza as thick as a tefach(8cm/3.2in) <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&st=&pgnum=116\">OC 460:5</a>(see adjoining MB as well) Again because there we are worried that perhaps because it is so thick, and the time it will take to bake it, that maybe the very center may become Hametz, but less than that, there are no worries.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that I know of various Teshuvot in Rav Ovadia Yosef's books that state that machine matzah are fine but should not be used for the seder itself, unless nothing else if available.  My Havruta brought me a sefer from the Belzer Rebbe(printed two years ago) which claims the opposite, that hand made matzah is all Hametz and only machine matzah can be relied upon, unfortunately none of these are available online.</p>\n\n<p>However, from the Stam Halakhah in the Shulhan Arukh and Mishnah Berurah, it would appear to me that most of the \"problems\" with either machine matzah or hand made matzah are more a result of a people's accumulated humrot instead of any valid halakhic reasoning.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara says that it is a machlokes whether Shemoneh Esrai is a pure suffeik d'rabbanim and therefore you would not say it again, or if there is a special inyan that you can daven voluntarily, even when you're not in doubt, and simply repeat the prayer as a voluntary prayer.  The Shulchan Aruch, 107:1, holds that the halacha follow that one should repeat, reasoning that if one did say the Shemoneh Esrai before, his new prayer is a voluntary offering, and if had not said it, then the new prayer is a obligatory offering.  The M.B. (107:2) opines that one should not, in theory, repeat the Shemoneh Esrai unless he can think of different applications for the 13 requests in the middle section of the prayer, when there is doubt about having said it, then we regard the repetition as a \"new\" prayer, even if one actually did say it before.</p>\n\n<p>My rav, Rabbi Dovid Rosenbaum, shlita, recently spoke on the issue of whether one is unsure whether he skipped over some of the brachas or made a mistake in the Shemoneh Esrai.  Applying the principles stated above regarding the Shema, he said that if you have not gotten to \"v'al ha kol,\" one should go back to what you remembered having prayed and restart from there.  The S.A. (117:2-5) provides rules regarding fixing mistakes in the saying of the \"v'sain tal u'matar\" which generally require the repetition of the entire prayer if you have already backed out, or allow you to restart from birchas hashanim depending on the season and other factors.

    "content": "# Pinchas and Halacha In Front Of One's Rabbi\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Eiruvin 63a,b learns that one is not allowed to <em>paskin</em> a <em>halachah</em> in front of one's Rebbi.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple examples and details are brought. In particular, Elazar haKohen taught the soldiers coming back from the war with Midian the <em>halachos</em> of making utensils <em>kosher</em> when Moshe was standing by (and forgot the law, as is expounded by a <em>midrash</em>). Even though Elazar said respectfully,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and this is the halacha that Hashem said to Moshe</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>still, he was punished.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, don't we observe a similar effect with Pinchas suggesting to Moshe (before slaying Zimri) that this was the <em>halacha</em> that Moshe himself taught, and Moshe replied that it's fitting therefore that Pinchas himself do the killing.</p>\n\n<p>But what is the difference between Elazar's statement and the one from Pinchas - we see no mention that he was ever punished for <em>paskening</em> in front of Moshe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 82a) states that when Pinchas saw Zimri consorting with Kazbi the Midianite, he said to Moshe: Did you not teach me that if someone does such a thing, zealots may kill him ? Moshe replied with a parable: Let he who reads the letter, fulfill its instructions.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem to me that Pinchas did not Pasken before Moshe Rabbeinu, but rather according to our sages, he asked a Shaila of Moshe Rabbeinu based on the halakha that he had heard from Moshe Rabbeinu.  If this was forbidden every Talmid Hakham in every Yeshiva would be in major trouble.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Gemara Sanhedrin 82a(Shmuel's opinion)says that Pinchas had an emergency situation whereby the name of G-d was being disgraced and no one was doing anything about it; if there is a clear conflict we say <em>ein chochmah v'ein tevunah neged Hashem</em>, human dignity is overridden, so he ruled in his teacher's presence.</p>\n\n\n",

But with that responsiblity comes the issue of possibly owning chametz that might be contained in one of the boxes you accepted delivery for.</p>\n\n<p>In our community, a member just opened a service that provides mailboxes to customers and helps them with mailing packages, as well.  In theory, one of the packages he holds for a customer could contain chametz.  Nevertheless, the owner of the service is not the owner of the package.

What are the potential halachic problems for both the person conducting such tests (if Jewish), and for potential consumers of the product?</p>\n\n<p>*Please note that I am specifically <em>not</em> referring to animal testing in medical research, nor the animal testing of any products with a medically indicated use.* </p>\n\n<p><strong>A bit of background:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Many categories of product are legally required to be tested on animals. For most of these, the products cannot be manufactured safely and effectively without animal testing. (Generally, I am not referring to such products in my question. However, some of these products--tobacco products, certain chemical-based household cleaners and pet foods, drugs used for purely cosmetic purposes--are not essential for use. I would be interested on any potential halachic limits on the use of these in light of their animal testing.)</p>\n\n<p>There are also some types of product that are not legally required to be tested on animals in the Western world. The products for which non-required animal tests are performed include cosmetics, toiletries, and household products. Animal tests on these products are generally considered <a href=\"http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/_assets/userfiles/files/BUAV_ScienceReport-SCREEN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">not necessary</a> to confirm safety or efficacy, since alternative means of testing exist. However, many manufacturers still perform animal tests on such products, largely because lawyers <a href=\"http://apps.americanbar.org/environ/committees/lawstudents/pdf/mcneal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">counsel them to do so to avoid liability</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the tests are undoubtedly <a href=\"http://www.buav.org/undercover-investigations/theuglytruth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cruel</a> <a href=\"http://www.pcrm.org/search/?cid=527#4\" rel=\"nofollow\">and</a> <a href=\"http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/cosmetic_testing/tips/common_cosmetics_tests_animals.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">painful</a> to their animal subjects. </p>\n\n<p>Non-animal-tested cosmetic and household products are widely available; however, the brands that do not test may be more expensive, and they do not necessarily offer the same product formulations as animal-tested brands. </p>\n\n<p>There is a distinction between products that use ingredients that have been tested for safety/efficacy on animals in the past, and cases in which the \"finished product\" is tested on animals by the company itself. Most cosmetics and household product companies that claim not to test their products on animals are referring to finished products, and (often) also to any proprietary ingredients that they may invent. However, they are not referring to ingredients that have been tested on animals by others in the past. Companies that do test on animals may test finished products and/or the new ingredients that they develop specifically for their products. I can't imagine there would be concern with purchasing products with ingredients that have ever been tested on animals in the past; what I am asking about is the case where <em>new</em> animal tests are undertaken to produce something. </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: As of 2013, the E.U. and <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/israel-bans-cosmetics-tested-on-animals\" rel=\"nofollow\">Israel</a> have banned all non-drug cosmetic and household products tested on animals, as well as animal testing of new ingredients, so this question applies mostly to Jews in the U.S. and other countries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I am interested in answers that address any or all of the following:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is purchasing or using animal-tested products for non-medical reasons halachically questionable? </p></li>\n<li><p>If so, under what circumstances might it be permissible?  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you simply have a preference for a household or cosmetic product that is\nanimal tested, is that reason enough to use it?   </li>\n<li>If you cannot easily find or afford non-animal-tested products that suit your basic needs, is that reason enough to use tested products?  </li>\n<li>What about a quasi-medical need for an animal tested product, such as using it to prevent pimples or dandruff? (Many products in these categories are considered \"drugs\" by the U.S. FDA and therefore must be animal tested.) </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Does one have a responsibility l'chatchila to know the animal testing status of the products available, or may one remain ignorant? </p></li>\n<li><p>Is it permissible for a Jew to engage in the animal testing of products such as cosmetics? </p></li>\n<li><p>If it is known that a Jew was involved in the unnecessary animal testing (or testing of an unnecessary product), would it then be an even greater transgression to buy and use this product? Assume the animal testing was cruel. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Shulchan Aruch even Hoezer (very end of Siman 5), \"anything that is for Refuah (healing) or for a purpose does not carry the prohibition of Tzar Ba'alei Chaim, therefore is would be permissible to pluck feathers from a living duck (I guess to use for a quill - mz) but the Minhag (custom) is to refrain from this because it is Achzoriyos (cruelty).\"</p>\n\n\n",

Did they disobey G-d and not circumcise their children in the desert?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>According to Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=71b&format=text\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamot 71</a>–72) the reason circumcision was not practiced in the desert is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Because of the hardships of the way  - a 40 year journey is no joke. Since is would have been dangerous for someone right after circumcision to get on the road, and they had no choice but to be on the road, they waited until the trek was over.</li>\n<li>Because there was no \"northern wind\" upon them. The northern wind is considered a cure and it would be dangerous to circumcise without this wind to cure them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That said, another interesting source exists (פסיקתא דרב כהנא. I didn't have a chance to actually see it, but I've seen a few references to it). According to this source there was circumcision in the desert. The reference from Joshua is understood as using circumcision as an idiom to achieving a new, higher, level, usually spiritual. In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0510.htm#16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> an expression of \"circumcising the heart\" appears, being the basis of this explanation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>An explanation I heard is that the 40 years in the desert was a utopian bubble, an unrealistic situation. The guaranteed manna, the constant supply of water, the protection of the cloud of glory, the absence of the need to work and a plethora of other miracles.<br>\n                 It explains why the 10 Spies desired to remain in the desert and not enter into the Land of Israel. (However, this expedition was only supposed to be an educational tool not the end goal.)<br>\n                              A Brit (Covenant) is when two parties join together and both promise to contribute. During these forty years G-d was the only one providing. The Jews were not required to do their part. This explains why the covenant of Brit Mila was not appropriate in the desert where only G-d was contributing. Only upon entering Israel, when the nation of Israel had to once again do their part, was it fitting for the Brit Mila ritual to be resumed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Circumcision has two parts: milah (\"cutting,\" the removal of the actual foreskin) and periah (\"uncovering,\" peeling away the membrane to expose the glans). The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.71b.14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 71b</a>) cites an opinion that the latter was not part of the commandment given to Avraham, and that it went into effect only when Yehoshua circumcised them (so that the statement that they \"were not circumcised\" can mean that this second stage hadn't been performed).</p>\n<p>Tosafos there (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.71b.19?lang=he&with=Tosafot&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first comment s.v. מאי טעמא</a>) notes that the Talmud seems to imply that in fact those born in the desert hadn't had milah performed on them either (for the reasons cited in JNF's answer), but they then cite other sources (Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer 29, and Rabbeinu Nissim) that indeed those born in the desert had undergone milah but not periah, and that this was what Yehoshua performed on them.</p>\n\n\n",

Also notice that the two sides are <em>Beit</em> Shammai and <em>Beit</em> Hillel.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_15.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud in Shabbos</a> outlines Between 3 and 5 disputes between Hillel and Shammai themselves, a mere handful. However, throughout the mishnah, one can see many more argumens between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, the two sages' respective schools, which survived them. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_and_Shammai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia article on them</a> counts 316, just in the Talmud! In fact, The <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/sotah/sotah_47.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud in Sotah</a> reprimands the two schools For insufficiently learning from their rabbis, saying that because of this disagreement increased, and the Torah became like 2 different entities. It was seemingly in this climate that the events related in Eruvin transpired. Up until this point, there simply hadn't been much dispute over the law. Suddenly, hundreds of disagreements were sprouting up left and right. I'm afraid an outline of the specific arguments is beyond me, but the <a href=\"http://www.emishnah.com/PDFs/Berakhot08.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8th chapter in Brachot</a>, or the 1st chapter of Yebamoth <a href=\"http://www.emishnah.com/Nashim_Vol_1/Yev1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishnah 4</a>, come to mind, for starters.</p>\n\n<p>To complicate things further, <strong>Etz Joseph</strong> brings a rule from <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_7.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the beginning of Avoda Zara</a> that when Tanaaim argue, we generally follow wisdom and number, siding with the wiser majority. In this case, both parties had one advantage. Beit Hillel had the majority, but Beit Shammai had more brilliant minds. Given the stated rule in the Talmud, perhaps we can add that they argued for so long because they weren't sure how to deliberate in such an uncommon case, until given Divine input<sup>1</sup>. So we can add to the pile a need to clarify just how <em>to</em> deliberate given the rare, perhaps unprecedented stale mate with which they were faced. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30234/4682\">Tosafot alludes to this as well</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, <strong>Ritvah</strong> brings a quandary from the French scholars about the concept of 'these and these'. How can two contradictory rulings be true. They answer that Moses had both rulings explained to him when he went up to get the Torah. When he asked about definitive ruling, God told him that it would be left to the Sages of each generation to decide upon. So we see that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel were both right. They both had sound, irrefutable, and divinely ordained positions. Before the message of 'these and these' though, they assumed, as any rational mind would, that in the case of objective law, there is <em>one</em> right answer! So the three years was likely also spent in a hopeless gridlock, where both sides tried and failed again and again to find a flaw in each other's rulings<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>In short:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They had much disputed halachic material to cover, upwards of a hundred times what their predecessors were faced with, much of which may have surfaced along the way.</li>\n<li>They had to figure out how to rule with equal halachic priority</li>\n<li>They were attempting and reconcile the assumption of one right approach with the persisting existence of two.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. The Talmud does provide a recourse if neither part has wisdom and number; follow the stricter opinion for biblical and the more lenient opinion for rabbinic. Etz Joseph doesn't mention that though, and indeed the Talmud in eruvin does not follow that deliberation, or the law would follow Beit Shammai, who with few exceptions take a more strict approach than its contemporary school. The implication of the whole story in Eruvin is that Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai where sure that there was only one 'right' way. They had to be told that there can be more than one correct ruling. It appears evident that this was a later addition to the rule, following this 3 year dispute.</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup>2. This was likely a very troubling time for Rabbinic Judaism. In fact, the Tur in the name of the Ba'al Halachot Gedolot codifies a fast on the 9th of Adar, which is said to mark the beginning of this great dispute. <a href=\"http://leimanlibrary.com/texts_of_publications/36.%20The%20Scroll%20of%20Fasts%20The%20Ninth%20of%20Tebeth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See page 3</a>.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

What were the specific arguments on each side?  They argued for two and a half years, so this doesn't seem to have been a passing difference of opinion, but rather an argument with substance.</p>\n\n<p>(I've seen <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/27152/472\">this question</a>, but it focuses on how we interpret this and I'm asking about what the points in the argument were in the first place.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>All of the sources I found seem to deal on some level with the investigation of human nature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ben Jehoaidah, Eruvin 13b</strong> explains that Israel, (he says ישראל‏ specifically), was created as a part of the בריאה‏ from the Throne of Glory, citing the Arizal that we were created for the glory of Gd. as opposed to angels who are a part of the יצירה‏. The pertinent difference between these two primordial planes is that, when coming from בריאה‏ our non-verbal thoughts and feelings have the power to impact our surroundings. The argument was based around whether or not we should have been created within the בריאה‏, (notice the phrase in the Talmud uses the word נברא‏).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The argument against creation within the בריאה‏ was that since we have so very many impure or evil thoughts that negatively impact the world not having a toehold in the בריאה‏ would make these legions of corrosive thoughts ineffectual.</li>\n<li>The argument for creation within the בריאה‏ was that we would gain much, (מרויח ריוח גדול‏), from all of the good that our heartfelt intentions could accomplish, and any evil thoughts could be amended and purified, (I assume through repentance?), and also that they would be nullified as being in the minority, (וגם בטיל במיעותיה‏).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It was concluded that we'd be better without a stake in the בריאה‏, like angels, because our negative feelings and thoughts are overwhelmingly many. In this source, we see the discussion and evaluation of human nature as a powerful thing in and of itself, even without action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Etz Joseph, (in Ein Yaakov, Eruvin 13b)</strong>, quotes the <strong>MHRS\"A</strong> on Makkos 23a, who explains that the Torah is broken down in to positive 'do' commandments and negative 'don't' commandments. The argument was grounded in this frame work. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The argument against creation was that while on the the one hand we lose the opportunity to perform positive commandments, we at least are guaranteed the fulfillment of the negative ones by our non-creation and by extension our inaction. However if we are created, we run the risk of transgressing the negative commandments, which would counteract any reward we might gain from positive commandments, (יצא שכרו בהפסדו‏).</li>\n<li>The argument for creation was that by not being created, we are guaranteeing that we will not fulfill any positive commandments. Thus all of the reward we get from fulfilling the negative commandments would be lost while filling the (hypothetical?) lack of reward from the neglected positive commandments, (יצא הפסדו בשכרו‏). However if we are created, we gain the opportunity to reap reward from all of the positive commandments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We see again human nature, this time in the context of risk and reward. In the end, it came down to numbers. The commandments were formally enumerated, (perhaps for the first time which is why it took so long?). There were found to be 365 negative commandments versus 248 positive commandments. Thus it was concluded that what  we stand to gain comes in less number and variety than what we stand to lose, and thus we would be better off not running the risk of creation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Anaf Joseph, (Ein Yaakov, ibid)</strong>, brings two possible understandings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>First</strong>, he explains that we could have been created by way of an 'intermediary', like the rest of the animals, who were brought forth by the globe, (גלגל‏, By way of either earth or water? He seems to only mention earth, perhaps due to a focus on humans?). In other words, Gd could have commanded that the earth bring us forth just as he commanded it to bring forth plants and animals. Or he could, (and did), create us directly. The argument was about manner of creation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The argument against our direct creation by Gd was that being created on a lesser level, by way of an intermediary, would make our sins and punishments less severe.</li>\n<li>The argument for our direct creation by Gd was that being created directly by Him would cause him to be more lenient and merciful with us , so to speak, as opposed to indirect creation which would result in immediate destruction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So the argument here was based around human nature when it came to sin, and the examination of the consequences of sin. The agreed upon conclusion was that It would be better for us \"to not be created\", (I assume directly by Gd based on what comes next), because being created on this level, work of the hands of the Creator of all, results in much more severe ramifications of our sins, (I speculate that the alternative argument was dismissed because it was also concluded that sin does not result in immediate destruction, and that even the extra mercy, so to speak, that we enjoy from Him is strained, so to speak. See this 2000+ year exile for reference).</p>\n\n<p><strong>His other</strong> possible understanding does not detail the arguments, just the point of contention and the conclusion with its reasoning. He says that בריאה‏ specifically was discussed. בריאה‏ is our creation as is, which requires us to to elevate ourselves to a spiritually whole plane of עשייה‏, with free choice. This would be opposed to only experiencing עשייה‏, that is existing in a way that it is our nature to fulfill Gd's will without inner conflict. It was concluded that just עשייה‏ would have been better, because the paragons, the בני עלייה‏, who actually attain this ascension from בריאה‏ to עשייה‏ are few and far between.</p>\n\n<p>I am speculating, but it seems that the Sages struggled with the path of ascension's merit and increased reward versus its extreme difficulty. On the one hand, arriving at עשייה‏ from בריאה‏ would find us more richly adorned than if we began at עשייה‏. On the other hand, the struggle of ascension could prove to be too much for us, leaving us right where we started or lower, so why not just begin from עשייה‏, with guaranteed moderate sustenance and reward? After a statistical analysis of human nature, the Sages concluded that for humanity as a whole, עשייה‏ would have been a better starting place.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. Ezra Alteschuler (I think) in the Torah publication הבאר <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=12898&st=&pgnum=34&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> raises two points on this gemara:</p>\n\n<p>1) Why did they argue for exactly two and a half years?</p>\n\n<p>2) Usually when there is a dispute between Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel it says \"Beis Shammai holds like this and Beis Hillel hold like this\", but here it doesn't say what each one holds, it merely says that these held like this and these held like this.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in Berachos 17a teaches that R. Alexandri used to pray to Hashem after he finished the Shemoneh Esrei: We wish to do Your will, but what prevents us? Our evil inclination and our subjugation to the kingdoms.</p>\n\n<p>Now, he cannot be saying that there are two separate reasons why we do not do Hashem's will, because having an evil inclination is an essential part of our being, without which we would have no free will and hence there would be no reward or punishment. Having both a good and evil inclination means that the scales of choice are balanced and thus gives us an equal opportunity to choose good. Therefore, having an evil inclination cannot be used as an excuse by itself. Rather, what he means is that the two reasons <strong>together</strong> tilt the scales against our choosing to do the will of God, and this is a very strong claim.</p>\n\n<p>Thus when Yisrael dwelt in their land under their own rule, and there was true free will because the good and evil inclinations were balanced and so it was not difficult to do God's will, it was certainly true that it was better for man to have been created than not to have been created. But after we were exiled from our land and became subjugated to the kingdoms, so that now both this and our evil inclination together worked against our choosing to do God's will, then it was better for man not to have been created than to have been created.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we know that when Bar Kochba ruled, there were many who believed that he was the Moshiach, and there were many who did not believe this. And these latter were afraid that he would not succeed and as a result the exile would be even worse because the Romans would declare them all to be rebels against the kingdom. The gemara in Sanhedrin 97b says that Bar Kochba ruled for two and a half years, and during those two and a half years some of the students of Shammai and some of the students of Hillel thought that he was the Moshiach, and thus decided that the time had come when we could happily say that it was better that man had been created. But on the other hand there were some students of Shammai and Hillel who held that he was not the Moshiach, and that he would cause a worsening of their subjugation, and therefore they said that it was better if man had not been created.</p>\n\n<p>And after the two and a half years, after the downfall of Bar Kochba and all their hopes had been dashed and everyone knew that the coming of the real Moshiach was a long time off, they took a vote and decided that it was better for man not to have been created than to have been created - until Moshiach will truly come.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Taharas hamishpacha practices during pregnancy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am basing this question on this quote from the Wikipedia page on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_childbirth_customs\">Hasidic childbirth customs</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the beginning of pregnancy, a woman's separation behavior depends\n  on the regularity of her menstrual cycle prior to becoming pregnant:\n  if her menses occurred at regular intervals, she should observe the\n  same 12-day separation pattern for three months; but if her menses\n  occurred irregularly, she observes ritual separation for one month\n  only. (Finkelstein & Finkelstein 1993)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had never heard that some couples continue to separate on a schedule while the woman is pregnant. I assume that this is done in case the pregnancy turns out to be a false alarm.  Does this actually happen in some communities, and how common is it? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is because it is possible to get a period while pregnant, and it's even possible to get pregnant again while already pregnant (i.e. not twins). This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfetation\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfetation</a></p>\n\n<p>The halacha takes this into account, and therefor all taharas hamishpacha practices continue like normal during pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>Someone who has a <em>Chazakah</em> (a regular pattern) needs to clear that pattern three times in order to stop it (not just during pregnancy, always). Nothing changes during pregnancy - the pattern needs to be cleared three times. (As far as I know this is just an Onah - i.e. an internal check and one day/half day separation, not an actual 12 day separation. I've never heard of anyone separating for 12 days for a chazakah, pregnancy or otherwise. That part of the article may be inaccurate.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I'm going to say that whoever wrote the wikipedia article did not understand the sources they were reading.  First let me state the noticeable problems. \nAccording to Halakha a woman may not tell her husband that she is Tameh when she is not (Even HaEzer 77 and Nosei Kelim).  It would give her the status of a moredet, which is a person (a mored in the case of a man) who refuses to have marital relations with their spouse. \nSaying a bracha at the mikvah would then result in a brakha l'vatala (a blessing said in vain), as the woman has no obligation to go to the mikvah.</p>\n\n<p>Now let us look at the actual halakha.  Regarding a pregnant woman the Shulachan Arukh YD 189:33&34 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A pregnant woman, after three months into her pregnancy, and a nursing\n  woman all twenty-four months after the birth of the newborn do not\n  establish a Vesses(a regular start of her period). This is valid even if the child died or if she\n  stopped nursing him since her periods are on hold during the all\n  pregnancy and all twenty-four months. A pregnant woman once the\n  pregnancy is noticeable and a nursing woman all twenty-four month do\n  not suspect their previous Vesses. Even if she had a Vesses Kavua and\n  it turned up during this time she is not required to make a Bedika and\n  is permissible to her husband. Even if they have a heavy discharge and\n  see in the very Onos that they are used to see, it is only a\n  coincidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now regarding a woman who has a regular cycle the Shulhan Aruch YD 184:2 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the time of her Vesses, he must separate from her for one ona; not\n  from all physical closeness, but only from relations. If the Vesses is\n  during the day, he must separate from her the entire day even if the\n  Vesses is at the end of the day, and he is immediately permitted that\n  coming night. Similarly, if it is at the beginning of the day, he’ll\n  separate the entire day but is permitted the entire previous night.\n  The same rule applies if it (the Vesses) is by night, he’ll separate\n  the entire night but will be permitted the previous and coming day.\n  (All this applies) whether she established the Vesses in three times\n  or only in one time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So according to these two halakhot it is necessary to separate for one <em>ona</em> (12 hour period according to the proportional hour) during the ona that she is expected to have her cycle.  The Or Zarua (which coincidentally is what most Chassidim hold by, and thus is pertinent to our discussion) on the Gemara Nidda 63b holds (depending on how you read him) that either they must separate for the ona she expects and the previous one as well (a 24 hour period; Chabad custom see Shulhan Arukh HaRav ad loc) or for the ona before and after the ona she expects which would make a 36 hour period (Satmar and Gerrer custom relying on my see Ohel Shlomo ad loc).  </p>\n\n\n",

They instruct us how to answer when we are confronted with a particular question, and these relate to the Mitzvoth of Pesah.  The rabbis, however, teach us that the person asking this question is identifiably wicked, which they interpret from the language used, both in the question and in the answer.  The question implies that he has disassociated himself from the community of believers.  The answer implies that <em>we</em> would have been redeemed, but not he.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the difference between fasts, especially Yom Kippur, and Pesah, is that the latter is fundamental to our system of belief and our way of life as the basis for why we serve G-d.  We became His nation at that point, when He redeemed us as He had promised.  But on fast days, we recognize that we are all sinners.  Everyone makes mistakes.  But on Pesah, if someone doesn't even want to be part of it, he's rejected everything, why should we invite him closer?  He wouldn't have been redeemed anyway.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are certainly explanations of how the answer to the wicked son is not dismissive, such as the explanation from the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe that the message is that he wouldn't have been redeemed from <strong>there</strong>, but in the final redemption all will be included even him. And the Arizal says that each cup in the Seder corresponds to each of the sons, in order, so the cup which the whole Maggid is said corresponds to the wicked son, thus really the whole haggadah is primarily addressed to him, and similar explanations.</p>\n<p>However, it has always bothered me how you really see that in the answer. That is the hint, but not what is on the page. If that was the main message, עיקר חסר מין הספר - the main point is missing and only alluded to.</p>\n<p>Rather, I think the plain understanding is in keeping with what Tanya says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7908/jewish/Chapter-29.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 29</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He should also thunder against it (the sitra achra - the source of evil) with a strong and raging voice in order to humble it, as our Sages state, “A person should always rouse the good impulse against the evil impulse, as it is written, ‘Rage, and sin not.’”</p>\n<p>This means that one should rage — in his mind — against the animal soul, which is his evil impulse, with a voice of stormy indignation, saying to it: “Indeed, you are truly evil and wicked, abominable, loathsome and disgraceful,” and so forth, using all the epithets by which our Sages have called it.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>The reason that humbling the spirit of the sitra achra is effective in crushing it is that in truth there is no substance whatever in the sitra achra. That is why it is compared to darkness, which has no substance whatsoever, and is automatically banished by the presence of light.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Indeed, we find this explicitly stated in the Torah in connection with the Spies sent by Moses to scout out the Holy Land. At the outset they declared: “For he (the enemy) is stronger than we,” and, interpreting the word ממנו , the Sages say:</p>\n<p>“Read not 'than we,' but 'than He,'” meaning that they had no faith in G‑d’s ability to lead them into the Holy Land. But afterwards they reversed themselves and announced: “We will readily go up [to conquer the Land].”</p>\n<p>Whence did their faith in G‑d’s ability return to them? Our teacher Moses, peace unto him, had not shown them in the interim any sign or miracle concerning this, which would restore their faith. He had merely told them that G‑d was angry with them and had sworn not to allow them to enter the Land.</p>\n<p>What value did this Divine anger and oath have to them, if in any case they did not believe in G‑d’s ability to subdue the thirty-one kings who reigned in the Land at that time, for which reason they had had no desire whatever to enter the Land?</p>\n<p>Surely, then, the explanation is as follows: Israelites themselves are “believers, [being] the descendants of believers.” Even while they stated, “The enemy is stronger than He,” their divine soul still believed in G‑d. They professed a lack of faith in His ability only because the sitra achra clothed in their body in the person of their animal soul had risen against the light of the holiness of the divine soul, with its characteristic impudent arrogance and haughtiness, without sense or reason.</p>\n<p>Therefore as soon as G‑d became angry with them, and thundered angrily: “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation…,Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness…I, G‑d, have spoken: I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation...,” — their heart was humbled and broken within them when they heard these stern words, as it is written, “And the people mourned greatly.” Consequently, the sitra achra toppled from its dominion, from its haughtiness and arrogance.</p>\n<p>But the Israelites themselves i.e., as far as their divine soul was concerned had believed in G‑d all along.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We confront him in order to turn him around, like the spies were confronted and regretted their behavior.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Opening a fridge on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many problems with using electricity on Shabbat, and many ways to understand those problems. The issue of using a fridge is especially problematic (as explained in depth by Rav Nissan Kaplan in <a href=\"http://ravkaplan.dafyomireview.com/aud/5773-Halacha/5773-011_refrigerator%20_on_Shabbos.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> shiur), but the issue I find most confusing is that of opening the door.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12604/1659\">this</a> excellent answer, there are several reasons as to why opening the fridge might be problematic, and as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11025/what-do-you-do-if-you-forgot-to-turn-off-the-refrigerator-light-before-shabbat\">this</a> question implies, the easiest solution is to remove the light fitting in advance.</p>\n\n<p>My question pertains to the fact that removal of the light fitting only appears to enable one to open the door if we pasken like Rav Auerbach, who held that the problem is either one of minhag or of heating the filament. What happens if one were to pasken like the Chazon Ish, who held that the problem is one of <em>boneh</em>?</p>\n\n<p>I don't understand how the fridge mechanism works, but I would think that the prohibition of <em>boneh</em> would still apply even if the light doesn't come on. If the bulb is broken or is not in its fitting, flicking a switch (in this case, opening a door) still causes the circuit to close.</p>\n\n<p>If one were paskening according to the Chazon Ish, would he need remove the circuitry from his fridge every Friday?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To make a circuit it must be a complete circuit, i.e. a full unbroken circle.</p>\n\n<p>If there is no bulb then you did not make a complete circuit, since the bulb is part of that circle.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be a science question, not a halachik one.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I tape down the switch because modern fridges do other functions besides turn on a light. Fancier fridges will turn off the fan when you open the door, to prevent cold air blowing out. Other fridges will count how many times the door gets opened, and after a certain number of times they will trigger the auto-defrost.</p>\n\n<p>It's better to buy a simpler fridge because fancy ones don't do well when these mechanisms are overridden. The simpler ones have frost sensors, or just really long timers to trigger the auto-defrost.</p>\n\n<p>Circuit:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/-----generator--------------------\\\n|                                  |\n|                                  |\n|                                  |\n\\----(bulb)-------#switch#---------/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>PS. I assume you know the argument that it's not boneh because it's a routine action. Just like putting a storm window in the window on shabbos is not boneh, because that is a routine action done every night.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To answer the latter part of your question, let us first leave aside whether or not throwing a switch in and of itself is a matter of Boneh.  The Chazon Ish clearly held that it was, however that position is contested both from a halakhic as well as scientific standpoint.  However you asked what do people do who pasken like the Chazon Ish.  </p>\n\n<p>For the Chazon Ish the issue is not the door itself being opened, it is that throwing a switch is a matter of Boneh.  Therefore if one could conseivably arrange it so that the door could be opened without the switch being thrown, than the issue would be resolved.  The simplest solution for this, that does not require an understanding maintenance man, is to simply tape the switch down.  In a Refigerator the automatic light operates on a pressure release switch.  Meaning when the door is opened, it releases pressure from the switch, and an interior spring inside the switch cause it the switch to be thrown.  Therefore, by taping the switch down, one ensures that the pressure will remain whether the door is opened or closed.  </p>\n\n\n",

This is probably similar to what the Jews of the Exodus carried with them as they left, as Exodus 12:34 teaches us that the Jews took their matzahs bound up in their clothes and carried them on their shoulders.  Today's cracker-like matzahs would break under those conditions, but not Yemenite matzahs.</p>\n\n<p>What makes matzahs cracker like is the perferations rolled into the dough.  This allows air to escape during baking.  The earliest opinion I know of concerning this type of cracker-like matzah came from the Rema (Rabbi Moshe Isserles ca 16th century) who held that matzah should be <i>rekikin</i> (defined by some as <a href=\"http://www.steinsaltz.org/learning.php?pg=Daf_Yomi&articleId=2340\" rel=\"nofollow\">wafer-like</a> or \"<a href=\"http://www.realmatza.com/harav-schachter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">thin\").</a> (Rema,  Shulchan Aruch 460:4) I understand that a commentator to the Rema, the Baer HeiTeiv (1730 - 1770) noted that soft matzos were available still in his era.  It appears from my reading, that the cracker-like matzas were more of a result of mass production and the need to keep thme on the shelf longer.  Soft matzas do not have a long shelf life.</p>\n\n<p>Although it appears that many Ashkenazic Jews came to assume that perferating matzah dough was a requirement for it to be considered kosher for Passover, <a href=\"http://www.realmatza.com/harav-schachter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Hershel Schachter, שליט\"א, holds</a> that this is not a requirement, and that Ashkenazic Jews can eat Sephardic soft matzah, citing as authority the <a href=\"http://www.realmatza.com/spongy-mi-berura.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna B'rurah</a> who speaks of \"Matza made as soft as a sponge\" which can be used for the Mitzvah of eating Matza.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If requested by the OP I will go and find the sources to back up my words.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few issues at work here. The first is that in Europe matzah became less soft because of the way Europeans make bread in general. If you notice, Europeans don't make flat breads at all. The reason for this is because European ovens are very different than Middle Eastern ovens. </p>\n\n<p>In European ovens, a large box is filled with hot air and it is the hot air itself that cooks the bread. This hot air dries out the outer layers of bread. So Europeans bake very large/thick breads so that way even if the outside is dry, you still have plenty of soft center. But thin flatbreads will just become dried out and very unpleasant to eat in such an oven. Unfortunately European Jews became so accustomed to their ovens that when reading halakhic texts they erroneously think the word תַּנּוּר (tanoor) refers to their type of ovens.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is that תַּנּוּר is related to all Middle Eastern type ovens, and in fact the Indian Tandoor oven clearly shares the same name. These ovens cook very thin breads primarily using hot surfaces. So when the Bible, or the Shulchan Arukh of Yosef Karo speak of ovens/תַּנּוּר they mean this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ogZtT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ogZtT.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7wiSJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7wiSJ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In light of this one will notice that when the Shulchan Arukh speaks of the methods of cooking matzah, all of them involve cooking matzah with a hot surface, and not hot air.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh Orach Chaim 461:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סעיף ב אבל צרך להסיק תחלה, בין תנור בין כוביא בין באלפס בלא מים בין\n  בקרקע... </p>\n  \n  <p>Paragraph 2 - ...However, firing is needed at the beginning, whether\n  it is used in an tanoor, a frying pan, a stew-pot without water, or on\n  the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So originally European Jews made their matzah thicker (as it could be made up to a tefach thick). Making matzah that thick would still create a matzah that has a crisp outside surface, but would be soft on the inside like any other thick bread. But as they started making their matzah thinner and thinner to keep in line with opinions like the Rema, the matzah itself would become dried out and hard. Eventually they adopted the custom of poking holes in the matzah to cause the moisture to escape rather than allowing it to bubble on the bread (out of fear that these bubbles were chameitz), further drying out the matzah. Eventually the industrial revolution happened and the matzah factories figured out they could create machines to mix drier and drier doughs creating a shelf stable matzah that could be transported, sold, and stored for years.</p>\n\n<p>So I would estimate that by the time of the Rema, matzah was starting to dry out as a consequence of European ovens and the growing custom of making matzah thinner and people not remembering how matzah used to be. As the matzah became drier and drier it eventually became the custom to expect matzah to be dry, and the matzah factories of the industrial revolution took this custom to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Oddly enough, one can make matzah on a European stove by putting a frying pan on the burners to make flat bread. However this does not occur to most people. For my household I make our matzah either in my tandoor oven or on another arabic oven called a saj for the seder. But during the rest of the hag I use our stovetop.</p>\n\n\n",

(such as Yisro who was one of the very few truth-seekers who converted due to hearing of the miraculous exodus)</p>\n\n<p>(the obvious answer is to give man free will. but perhaps a few rare miracles would not alter free will so much)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Ramchal in Da'as Tevunos explains that Hashem's hidden-ness is the only vehicle for fulfilling the purpose of the world.

There is required to be a world in which it looks like not everything is a result of Hashem's direct guidance and exactly in accordance with His will in order to fully appreciate what it means that everything <em>is</em> under His control. </p>\n\n<p>Siman 38:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה מה שאנו צריכים להבין הרבה, הוא ענין החסרונות האלה הנמצאים בבריאה, ענין הרעות הנמצאות בה, שהם ענינים שלא כחק שלמותו ית', וכמו שביארנו, אשר על כן נכשלו בם הפושעים, איש לפי דרכו הרעה, וכמו שביארנו לך למעלה; כי ודאי לפי שלמותו ית' לא היה לו לעשות אלא טובות לבד. אמנם עתה אבינך הכל על בוריו בס\"ד. הנה כשאנו אומרים שהקב\"ה הוא יחיד, הלא אנו מבינים שאין זולתו, שאין הפך לו, שאין מונע לו, ולאפוקי מכל אותם הסברות שזכרנו. נמצא, שלא די לקיים בו ית' הטוב, אלא שצריך לשלול ממנו ההפך.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the natural world is a prerequisite to revealing the depth of Hashem's ייחוד.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Any open miracle would still be questioned.

And yet the people who observe the miracles, even the people <em>affected</em> by the miracles, come up with their own interpretation of them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>What a great question for preparing for Shavuos!  I think there are many answers, but I think the best answer is two-fold:  </p>\n\n<p>(1) G-d cannot reveal Himself yet because we are not spiritually prepared.  Long ago, at Mount Sinai, G-d actually spoke to the Jewish people when He gave them the Decalogue.  It was more than they could handle.  Our ancestors told Moshe, \"speak to us, and we will listen, but do not let G-d speak with us, lest we die.\"  Exodus 20:16; see also Deut. 5:20-24 (Moshe's summary of the event).  As high in spirituality as that generaton was, it was still overwhelmed by the Holiness of G-d that they experienced at that moment, and deemed themselves unworthy.  Ramban's commentary to that verse offers the point that G-d's personal revelation to the Jewish people posed a great challenge to them and the concept of preparing ourselves to receive the Divine revelation remains a challenge to us today; a challenge that requires us to achieve higher levels of holiness.</p>\n\n<p>(2) G-d appears to be hidden because He wants us to seek Him out.  Isaiah 55:6 states, \"Seek Hashem where He is found and call Him when He is near.\"  The Targum Yonasan paraphrases: \"Seek fear of Hashem while you are still alive, pray to Him while you still can seek Him and while you can still call Him, not after death when it is too late.\"  This is closely related to the first point -- seeking G-d requires that we elevate ourselves spirtually, repent, humble yourself before Him, love Him and fear His wrath.  Rav Nachman (the Tanna) held that the opportunity to seek G-d in this manner to be during the 10 days of Repentence between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Yevamos 49b.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that when one prepares himself to meet G-d, and seeks Him in prayer -- especially during the High Holy Days -- G-d's existence becomes increasingly real and more and more apparent in nature, in events affecting our lives, and in the eyes of our teachers.  And when I go to the beis midrash on Shavuos night, hearing the cacaphony of the bachurim arguing over pages of Gemara, I think I can make out the Voice of Hashem; and then it is not scary at all.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud itself also cites pesukim slightly different from our Torah. Traditional belief is just that the overall Torah is from Moshe, but not necessarily that there was never a letter omitted by a scribe.

It states that in the year 2448 on the Jewish calendar, an entire nation gathered at the foot of a mountain in the Sinai Desert and witnessed G-d speak. They made multiple copies of the written record and had them spread among the people. They passed on their eyewitness accounts together with the copies of the record to their descendants, teaching them to read the record publicly and observe the many rituals it contains. This is called the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The suggestion that at a later date someone introduced a change into that account represents the biggest conspiracy theory ever proposed, because it would require an entire nation of people to all knowingly agree to (and live by) the same lie. </p>\n\n<p>It is true that people make up stories and confuse details, but only when one or two people tell a story to those who were not there to contradict them.

People would notice if their own family history suddenly changed, and would certainly object if that change made demands of them as the Torah does. Getting an entire nation to go along with such a scheme is simply implausible.

(The reason for this is that it would be very hard to answer \"what does 'chosen' mean when people say it\" from sources; interpretation of a verse in Exodus may be easier.) If, or to the extent, \"chosen\" is not an interpretation of Exodus 19:5, I don't seek to know what \"chosen\" means.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people\">a Wikipedia article</a> on this, but it doesn't address this much and is unclear where it does.

    "content": "# How can we just make our chametz ownerless?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm trying to understand the \"legal fiction\" wherein we declare any chometz we have as ownerless like the dust of the earth. Is this halachically acceptable? How can a person declare something in his possession, possibly locked up in his house to be ownerless?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The original practice of Bittul (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 6b</a>) was for after one searched for and found all Chametz, and essentially we are left a concern that maybe he will find something small on Pesach that he missed, essentially saying \"that too is as irrelevant as dust.\" It does not help for a locked away closet full of Chametz.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, as a Torah matter, it would help if he was sincere (see Shulchan Aruch HaRav OC <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/431/2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">431:2</a>). If someone specifically locks it up in his property, that is quite a sign of insincerity - and no one suggests this is a real way out of the problem, but say a person leaves it out on his front lawn where it is easily taken. Then even though you may not possess it, the fact that it is on your property is not a problem - as a Torah matter. The Chachamim don't allow that (because you might forget and eat it or because you might not be sincere and just hope people won't take it).</p>\n\n<p>Once Jews started having a serious inventory of Chametz, the practice of selling it was introduced. This works around the locked closet problem, and to some degree the sincerity issue as at least the owner stands to get paid market value for the items. However, the pro-forma nature of the sale has had many objections that even that practice isn't sincere and thus not valid.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First if it is a \"legal fiction\" then you are in fact transgressing biblical and Rabbinical commandments regarding possessing Hametz over the course of Pesach.</p>\n<p>First you are referring to the Bitul Hametz that we all recite.  However it is important to note that the formula of that specifically says,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Any leavened food or leavening in my possession that I have not seen\nand have not destroyed is hereby considered null and and like the dust\nof the earth.\"(Yalkut Yosef 344:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It therefore does not cover any Hametz that you have seen, know full well where it is, and have no intention of destroying.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now regarding deciding to truly make your Hametz ownerless many\nposkim(halakhic decisors) say that you cannot reclaim it after\nPesach(as that would cast doubt upon the initial declaration).  The\nYalkut Yosef however brings a slightly more lenient approach and says:\nIn practice, if there are witnesses that the owner sincerely declared\nhis Hametz as hefker (ownerless) and it is clear that he did not do\nthis as a way to sidestep the halakha requiring him to destroy his\nhametz, he may then reclaim the Hametz after Pesach if it would cause\nhim a significant loss otherwise.  It is best, in such a case, that\nafter reclaiming the Hametz he mix it with other Hametz[that he\npurchased after Pesach] so that the reclaimed Hametz is a minority of\nthe mixture and unrecognizable in the mixture. (Yalkut Yosef 448:4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise you seem to believe that the sale of Hametz is also a legal fiction.  In truth for many years it was and many many major halakhic authorities spoke out against the practice.  Even today there are many people who do not rely upon the sale of Hametz.  However, for those that do, they have what to rely upon so long as the sale is not a legal fiction, either to them or to the one buying the Hametz.  <a href=\"http://shaareihoraah.org/wordpress/?p=787\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is an article that goes in depth in to the various halakhot that are involved in sales of hametz by any reliable agent of sale today.</a>  By Rabbi Peretz Moncharsh <a href=\"http://shaareihoraah.org/wordpress/?page_id=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">who's bio can be found here.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>When making something ownerless it is just that ownerless. In Halacha, to take possession of something you must pick it up or otherwise possess it. If you were to move something that has chametz, you would be regaining your ownership of it. If it was sold, you wouldn't be since it has a new owner already.</p>\n\n\n",

The \"maschis\" that is referred to is just a reference to the destruction that Hashem will create. It isn't referring to an angel.</p>\n<p>The Ohr Hachayim (there) understands that it was a two part system. Hashem was the only one could clearly determine who was really a first born in all circumstances. However, the actual killing was done by the Mashchis. So Hashem was intimately involved and yet the maschis \"pulled the trigger\".</p>\n<p>The Ramban explains that the answer lies in a Midrash which states that when Hashem goes out He is like a king who has guards who protect the king from those who would approach the king or stare at him disrespectfully. When we are dealing with Hashem, these guards are the malachei chavalah, destructive angels. So the plague is planned and even carried out by Hashem and yet Rashi is still correct. People needed to stay indoors so that they would not be attacked by the malachei chavalah, who were out protecting Hashem while He worked.</p>\n<p>The Beis HaLevi (Parshas Bo)... states that... the maschis did in fact kill the Egyptian firstborn. Yet, Hashem was intimately involved with the other aspect of the plague, the fact that the Jews were saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gr\"a answers (Divrey Eliyahu) that, as stated in the Haggada, it was Hashem himself who carried out the Death of the Firstborn. The idea of the \"mashchis\" that could not harm the Jews was that there were some people whose time had come to pass away that night, and had Hashem allowed the Angel of Death to take them as planned, the Egyptians would claim that they had died in the plague. Therefore, Hashem did not allow the \"maschis\" to touch any Jew, and pushed of the death of those who were destined to die on that night.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Chasam Sofer (Shu\"t YD 346:12) question the possibility that the Egyptains were killed directly by Hashem. We are told that Moshe and Aharon had the great merit of dying through \"Missas Neshika\" (a Divine Kiss by the Hashem himself); how could we possibly say that the Egyptians got this great privilege. He therefore explains that although Hashem wanted to send an emissary to smite the Egyptians, they were protected by their \"mazel\" which is called (see Zohar 3:250b) the \"firstborn\" and strongest of the \"mazalos\" and would not allow anything to harm them. Therefore Hashem had to first \"do away\" with their \"mazal\", before being able to send his messengers to  kill their firstborn. When the verse says \"וה' הכה כל בכור\", it is actually referring to Hashem (personally) killing the \"בכור\" - the mazel of the Egyptians, which later enabled the \"mashchis\" to kill them.</p>\n\n\n",

While there is indeed a <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2006/10/isru-chag.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a> in Psalms for the words, and while the Gemara indeed derives a notion of extra celebration, there seems to be little about the <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch/Orach_Chaim/429\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">scope</a> of the day.</p>\n<p>What troubles me is that the codification of Isru Chag via the Ramo takes place in galut -- post-15th century. The last day of Passover would already have been logically <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/526874/jewish/The-Jewish-Month.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">obviated</a> and maintained only as a derobonnon practice. Therefore, the deriving of a day as an extension of the holiday would already have been satisfied by the addition (and maintaining) of an entire second day of Yom Tov. Isru Chag would still have value in Israel because otherwise, nothing would be \"bound\" to the end of the holiday. But, outside of Israel, we are already \"binding\" a second day of Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>We know that the last day of Passover is not really part of the Biblically-mandated holiday. So the derivation of Isru Chag via a line in Psalms (written about the celebration <strong>before</strong> yom tov sheini shel galuyos existed) to create another day seems unnecessary.</p>\n<p>So, shouldn't Isru Chag be a practice only for Ashkenazim in Israel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source of Isru Chag is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.18b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 18b</a>.

It is not clear what the word's etymology is, or whether or not it is related to its homonym, כרפס, which turns up in Tanakh. That word, appearing in Esther 1:6, refers to a fine fabric, like linen (acc. to HALOT) or cotton (acc. to BDB). It is related to the Aramaic כרפסא and the Arabic كرباس (<em>karbās</em>), both of which derive from the Sanskrit <em>karpāsa</em> and the Greek καρπασος, meaning \"cotton plant\".</p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi (cf: Genesis 37:3), this word is synonymous with פסים, which appears both as a reference to the clothes that Yaakov gave Yosef, as well as in 2 Samuel 13:18, in reference to the clothes that Tamar was wearing when Amnon sent her away. According to Rabbi Manoach ben Yaakov of Narvona (MT Hilkhot Chametz uMatzah 8:2), the reason that we dip this type of vegetable on <em>erev pesach</em> is to remind ourselves of the dipping of Yosef's coat into blood, which resulted in the servitude of his entire family and their offspring.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Contrary to some answers here, it is actually very clear where the word's etymology comes from. It's Greek, from the word karpos, which literally means vegetable. Remember that the Greek language was somewhat ubiquitous in Israel at the time the haggadah was being written. The word afikomen is also Greek, as attested to in the Gemarah.</p>\n\n<p>I've read some explanations that point out that the Greek word karpos often referred to a raw vegetable and, even more specifically, to a green, leafy vegetable. Thus, the sages wanted to convey that karpas should always be done with an uncooked green, leafy vegetable such as parsley. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To make things short - I think it's just the vegetable's name.</p>\n\n<p>I searched my Haggadot (one of them includes 12 perushim) - nothing. Wikipedia in Hebrew also doesn't explain the name's origin.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing that comes to my head is that expensive fabrics are also called karpas in Meggillat Ester 1:6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חוּר כַּרְפַּס וּתְכֵלֶת אָחוּז בְּחַבְלֵי בוּץ וְאַרְגָּמָן עַל\n  גְּלִילֵי כֶסֶף וְעַמּוּדֵי שֵׁשׁ מִטּוֹת זָהָב וָכֶסֶף עַל רִצְפַת\n  בַּהַט וָשֵׁשׁ וְדַר וְסֹחָרֶת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Could imply some connection to the plant, but I still think it's just its name.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing, there's a known clue (Remez) in that name. the <code>ס</code> (Samech) represents (using Gimmatriah) 60 Riboh (10-thousands) of Israelies (men aged 20-60) praticipating in the exodus. The remaining letters of karpas - being <code>כרפ</code> - can be transposed to <code>פרכ</code> which hints the 60*10000 Israelies that were forced labour in Egypt.</p>\n\n\n",

They put one Sefer down on the bima and the other was held by someone on a bench behind the bima. They opened up the Sefer Torah and realized it was the one that should be read from 2nd, not first. They asked someone there who is a Rov what to do and he said to roll this one to the right place and read from it instead of bringing up the 2nd one that was already rolled to the right place.</p>\n\n<p>What is the source for this? If both Sifrei Torah were already taken out why can't the one on the bima be switched with the one on the bentch? Seemingly if we already have a Sefer Torah out of the Aron Kodesh that is ready to be read from better perhaps then \"bothering\" the tzibbur by rolling the Sefer Torah to the proper place. As well perhaps this is not going to be a problem of thinking there is a pagum in the Sefer Torah when they are already both out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> While I don't think this would be done practically. However in such a case why can't first the reading of what is really the \"2nd\" Sefer Torah be done before the normal reading of the day (which is in the first Sefer Torah.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Seemingly the Rov was wrong in his psak.</p>\n\n<p>In OC Siman 684 Sif 3 we find that on Rosh Chodesh Teves (when it's also Channukah) we take out 2 Sifrei Torah and read first the kriah from Rosh Chodesh and then the kriah from Channukah. The Rema says that if one makes a mistake and reads Channukah first that they must be mafsik and read the kriah of Rosh Chodesh. The M\"B however brings from the Taz that if one started Channukah first (by the aliyah of Cohen) they should finish the aliyah of the Cohen with the kriah of Channukah. Although there are cholkim on this many achronim paskened like the Taz. The Biur Halacha there in d'h \"v'im to'eh v'hischil...\" says that if one started to read Channukah first they should finish the aliyah of Cohen with the kriah of Channukah like the M\"B writes. He adds however that a \"haschalah\" (a starting/beginning) of the kriah is if the brachos were already made then one should finish the first aliyah with the Kriah of Channukah. However he says if the brachos were not yet said, even though the person was ready to begin the kriah of Channukah he should close this Sefer Torah and read in the other Sefer Torah that was taken out to read for the kriah of Rosh Chodesh. There is no reason to be choshesh he writes and says that there is no pagam in this Sefer Torah since it'll be read afterwards. Seemingly the same would be true in the case here of Chol HaMoed Pesach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe that the reason is so as not to dishonour the first Sefer by suggesting that it might be pasul.

    "content": "# Receiving someone else's chametz mail\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yesterday, I heard the door open and close. I went over and discovered that the mailman had delivered the mail. A magazine (which I looked forward to reading), some envelopes and a small package. I wasn't expecting a package. I picked it up and noticed that it was supposed to be delivered to my neighbor, a block away. I also noticed that the return address was from the Jelly Belly corporation. And the package made a distinct noise when I shook it...</p>\n\n<p>I have read about receiving free <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1391/free-sample-of-chametz\">samples</a> on Pesach, but this case was a bit more complex -- I wasn't receiving the sample, but I took it into my house. Do I hold on to it and destroy it without delivering it properly (though it isn't my mail to mess with) or do I deliver it and put it in his <em>reshut</em> and put him in the position to have to destroy it? Might that then indicate that I, even for a short time, took ownership of it without destroying it? And that I am willfully delivering chametz to him on Pesach that he might, even for a short time, acquire?  I know about CYLOR but the issues here seemed complex enough to raise here as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't get how you took ownership of it even for a moment. It's not yours, period. It belongs to the Jelly Belly company (it doesn't even belong to your neighbor), and their messenger simply left it on your property for a bit. You have no permission to destroy it since it's still theirs. Hashavahs avaida (returning a lost item) basically.</p>\n\n<p>As for your neighbor (I assume he is Jewish) the same applies: It's not his until he takes ownership of it. The Jelly Belly company sent it to him, but until he accepts it, it's not his. It's either abandoned, or it belongs to the Jelly Belly company (depending on if they expect it to be returned in case of addressing errors).</p>\n\n<p>(And Jelly Bellys are jellybeans, they are not usually chametz anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>Assuming they are chametz, your neighbor should simply leave it on the porch, or some other public place - let the ownership remain with Jelly Belly, or abandon it (his choice). To destroy it, he would have to take ownership of it, at least for a moment. And it seems to me it's better never to take ownership.</p>\n\n<p>If you are worried that your neighbor will not do the right thing, then just put it away somewhere and deliver it after Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

This was even more disturbing to them than their own nation being conquered!

Our Rabbis, however, interpreted [i. e., depicted Pharaoh] as a person who curses himself but ascribes his curse to others.

[From Sotah 11a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, Paro <em>was</em> worried about the Egyptian's defeat, and euphemistically referred to their own exile as the Jews'.</p>\n\n<p>It seems however, that since Rashi refers to the Rabbi's explanation as drush, and first explains the pasuk according to pshat, there is still an aspect of this that has to be answered.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Kluger in his sefer Imrei Shefer <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38352&st=&pgnum=69\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> gives a very different explanation of this posuk which includes explaining the last phrase literally - that the Yisrael will leave the land.</p>\n\n<p>The full English translation of this piece can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Kluger-Books/Imrei-Shefer/Shemos.html#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I will quote a section of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It seems that all that Pharaoh wanted was to get rid of\n  Yisrael’s presence from his land. However, he was concerned about\n  exiling them from his land, because that would require fighting with\n  them, provoking them to resist and fight back, and since they were more\n  numerous than the Egyptians, they would not succeed against them.\n  Therefore, he calculated that since he was the king he\n  knew how\n  big was his population and that of Yisrael, and he knew that they were\n  more numerous than his people. But they, on the other hand, did not\n  know how big the Egyptians were, and on the contrary, they probably\n  thought that the\n  Egyptians were more numerous than them.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, Pharaoh counselled that they should start\n  to impose decrees against Yisrael to make it seem as if they are\n  worried\n  and afraid about the future - afraid that Yisrael’s population might\n  increase. Then Yisrael will think that if they are afraid of an\n  increase only in the future, that implies that right now they are not\n  afraid. If so, it must be that they know that we are fewer in number\n  than them. This 'knowledge' will persuade them to accept our decrees\n  and not stand up against us, and since the decrees will be harsh they\n  will flee the country of their own accord.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, in reality they cannot flee from Egypt, because it is\n  impossible for a slave to escape, because, as Chazal have taught, the\n  Egyptians\n  used sorcery so that no slave could escape from Egypt. But this is only\n  true as long as they were in Egypt. But if a slave went outside of the\n  country, from there he could flee. Therefore, Pharaoh said, if we place\n  upon them harsh decrees which would make them want to leave, then\n  when a war will befall us they will act as if they were our friends,\n  and go together with us out of the country to fight against our enemy,\n  and once they have left the country they\n  will flee of their own accord, and that is what we want. According to\n  this, the words “they will fight בנו” means\n  “they will fight amongst us”.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is what the Torah is saying: “Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous, and stronger than us”, and I am afraid to oppose them, to fight against them in order to exile them. Therefore, “Be prepared, let us deal shrewdly with them”. And how will we deal shrewdly? - “lest they become numerous”, that is, we will act as if we are worried that they might become numerous in the future, but that right now, we are not afraid, because we are more numerous. Thus they will accept our decrees, and not oppose us. Thus, “it will be when a war befalls us, they too will be added to our enemies”, meaning against our enemies. They will act as if they too wish to “fight amongst us”, and leave the country with us to fight. Then, when they will be outside the country, “they will depart from the land”, and this is our goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Perhaps \"Bnei Yisrael will ally themselves with our (Mitzrayim's) enemies and [that enemy and the fifth column/BY], being victorious,  will leave Mitzrayim to go on to conquer other nations, leaving us (Mitzrayim) a defeated, wasted people.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a way, this is exactly what happened anyway: BY --\"allied\" with haShem-- defeated Mitzrayim. Via the makkot, left its economy and religious system in a shambles; with the gifts/back pay they received from the common people left it penniless; and, at yam Suf, destroyed its army.</p>\n\n\n",

And all those rules (את כל החוקים האלה) include all the Pesah <em>Halachot</em> until the last <em>halacha</em> – the <em>afikoman</em>, which is the last <em>halacha</em> of the eating of the Pesah sacrifice, and that's the meaning of the answer of the Hagada: teach the wise son all the <em>Halachot</em> till the last one.  </p>\n\n<p>As to the evil son – the evil son ridicules the Mitzvot (מה העבודה הזאת לכם). He doesn't understand the benefit of the \"work\", and therefore he doesn't want any part of it. And that's why it says \"אף אתה\" – you too. The same as he adds evil in not only not participating in the work, but also scorns those who do participate, you should add onto the answer given in the Torah and take the wind out of him by adding what’s written for the son who cannot ask and give him tit for tat – For me and not for him, to compliment what he said – for you and not for him.  So that's the meaning of the words אף אתה – you should also add things that aren't written in the Torah's answer to evil son.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Four cups of wine by the Pesach Seder -- From the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard there is an opinion that the <em>daled kosos</em> (four cups of wine) at the Passover Seder are <em>m'doraisa</em> (a Torah obligation). What is the source for this, if there is one? I vaguely remember a source being in the Yerushalmi?</p>\n<p>What Seforim speak about this? Are there any nafkei minah that are brought or discussed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Some commentators maintain that, according to the Talmud Yerushalmi, the obligation of the ארבע כוסות (Four Cups) is מן התורה (a Torah obligation). This is the view of the Kli Chemdah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21091&st=&pgnum=154\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Va'era</a>) based on the Yerushalmi in Shekalim (3:2), Nazir (6:5), and Pesachim (10:1, contra the Pnei Moshe's interpretation).</p>\n<p>To quote one example, the Yerushalmi in Shekalim questions whether one can fulfill the mitzvah of ארבע כוסות with wine of שביעית. Following the interpretation of the Yerushalmi that this refers to fruit after the time of ביעור, the Kli Chemdah explains that the Yerushalmi's question is whether the mitvah of ארבע כוסות can be דוחה the prohibition of eating פירות שביעית אחר זמן ביעור. This possibility could only be entertained if the obligation of ארבע כוסות is דאורייתא.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>During the shabbos hagadol drasha this year (5774) our rav mentioned the statement that each of the arba kosos is regarded as a separate mitzva. He stated that many mitzvos must be performed 'al hakos'. Thus the cups themselves are not mi'd'oraisa, but the mitzva they are drunk for are torah prescribed. Other mitzvos that are required al hakos are bris milah, birchat hamazon, or kiddush hayom.</p>\n\n<p>The four mitzvos in hagaddah are kiddush hayom, magid, birchat hamazon, and hallel.\nEach mizvah has a bracha said al hakos for that mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the question <strong>as asked</strong> it would appear that the answer would be \"no\", in one sense, and \"yes\" in another sense. That is, it is not the matter of the cups themselves that is from the torah, but the associated mitzva. Then again, perhaps the association may be what is being asked about (that is is the association of kos with the mitzva from the torah)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3507n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chametz UMatzah 7</a>:11 (in the Mechon Mamre order) there are two distinct obligations in the four cups, the obligation of the four cups (a cup of blessing on each of the four Mitzvos of Kiddush, Haggadah, Birchas HaMazon and Hallel) and the obligation of showing oneself to be free. And the Rambam explains that there are ways to end up drinking the four cups in a way to fulfill one of those without the other.</p>\n\n<p>The four cups aspect is Rabbinic, however the freedom aspect is easily understood as a Torah obligation, derived from specific Pesukim (Rambam there Halacha 8).</p>\n\n<p>So by drinking the four cups mixed to be sweet to the taste of the drinker is a specific way to fulfill the Torah obligation of showing oneself to be free.</p>\n\n<p>[It seems pretty obvious that the Torah requirement could be fulfilled in other ways, but that this is a way to do it, and the Rabbis (according to the Rambam, and the Rif agrees) specifically instituted this way to do it. Much like we say hearing Parshas Zachor is a Torah obligation, but the structure of hearing it in a Torah reading in public on the Shabbos before Purim is Rabbinic].</p>\n\n<p>In terms of a Nafka Mina, I haven't heard of any.</p>\n\n\n",

Yitzchak of Corbeil lists, in French, pois (peas), fole (perhaps, fave, fava beans, 'ful' in Hebrew) & ris (rice), which he lists as 'types of kitniyot'. \nPrior to that, the designation 'kitniyot' applied primarily in the context of the laws of kilayim.

Legumes have been used for centuries in crop rotation systems, as nitrogen-fixing bacteria reside in their root systems, and they replenish the soil better than any other plants (artificial nitrogen fixing is only about a century old).

    "content": "# Why seem to sell and be mafkir chametz?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding is that we do both of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We (appoint a rabbi as an agent to) sell our <em>chametz</em> to a gentile. This sale takes place the morning of the day before <em>Pesach</em>, before the prohibition of owning <em>chametz</em> kicks in.</li>\n<li>We renounce ownership in our <em>chametz</em>, declaring it ownerless. This also takes place the morning of the day before <em>Pesach</em>, before the prohibition of owning <em>chametz</em> kicks in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is seems, then, that whichever of these takes effect first renders us free of ownership of <em>chametz</em>, and whichever we do second therefore has no effect (unless one's acquired <em>chametz</em> meanwhile, an unlikely scenario). So why do the latter act (if, I mean, it has no effect anyway)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2188\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 448:5</a> rules that <em>chometz</em> which is found in your home after <em>Pesach</em>, even if you nullified it, is forbidden.  The Tur there (cited by Magen Avraham and Taz) explains that we are worried that a person will say he nullified it even if he didn't.  This isn't a problem for those crumbs that you don't want anyways.  But for that box of cheerios you were planning on enjoying, it's a problem.</p>\n\n<p>There is another reason that could be used to explain why it would be forbidden to use your <em>chometz</em> after you nullified it. If you nullify your <em>chometz</em> and declare that you consider it to be like dirt, and then start munching on it 9 days later, it would be a little bit of a contradiction to your nullification of it. (I can't remember where I saw this idea explicitly, but it is similar to the idea (Taz O.C. 442:8) that if you eat <em>chometz</em> which is degraded enough to not require getting rid of it, אחשביה, you have given it importance and reinstated its negated status.)</p>\n\n<p>If you sell your <em>chometz</em>, you don't have these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Selling your <em>chometz</em> would certainly not be prevented by having done <em>bittul</em> according to many Rishonim.  While Tosefos (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=4b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 4b</a> s.v. <em>mid'oraisa</em>) seems to hold that <em>bittul</em> accomplishes <em>hefker</em>, the implication of Rashi (ibid, s.v. <em>b'bittul b'alma</em>) and the explicit claim of the Ramban (Novelae to Pesachim 4b) is that <em>bittul</em> does not effect <em>hefker</em> and you still own your <em>chometz</em>.  As the Ramban explains it, with <em>bittul</em> you are declaring acquiescense to the Torah's prohibition of <em>chometz</em> and submitting to the <em>Torah</em>'s removal of <em>chometz</em> from your ownership.  This happens after your sale takes effect.  According to this view, you can \"nullify\" your <em>chometz</em> and still have ownership until the Torah removes it from your ownership at the 6th (or, Rabbinically, 5th) hour.</p>\n\n<p>You would still want to do <em>bittul</em>, either to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>tashbisu</em> according to those who hold it is a fulfillment of the <em>mitzvah</em> (Ramban novelae to Pesachim, among others), or just to fulfill the Rabbinical enactment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch HaRav (OC <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/431/4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">431:4</a>) writes that the Chachamim don't allow you to retain Chametz on your property during Pesach for two reasons: 1) You may not mean it when you say it is hefker and 2) you may forget and go eat it.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are going to keep Chametz in your closet over Pesach, hefker won't be enough, it has to be sold. Selling Chametz is a much more recent practice.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you have no Chametz (as was standard say 1,000 or more years ago) as the Chachamim didn't let you keep Chametz, hefker or not, they still required you to do the Bittul Chametz (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 6b</a>). Shulchan Aruch HaRav (OC <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/434/6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">434:6</a>) explains that this is in case you missed a piece that isn't nullfied automatically and you happen to find it on Pesach - if you don't destroy it right away, you would be in violation of the Torah prohibition of owning Chametz.</p>\n\n<p>In any event the point is that Bitul Chametz was a specific institution that the Chachamim made even though it is expected that you own no Chametz. So the subsequent practice of selling chametz (even if such a sale was actually to include the edible piece of Chametz that fell into a far corner - I don't think all sales are so thorough) doesn't remove the practice established by the Chachaimim to do Bittul Chametz.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The formulation for bitul chametz is\nis</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל חמירא וחמיעא דאיכא ברשותי, דחזיתיה ודלא חזיתיה, דבערתיה ודלא בערתיה, לבטיל ולהוי הפקר כעפרא דארעא\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Significant amounts of chametz cannot be nullified since it wouldn't realistically be possible to see it as \"dust.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The actual redemption was only brought about through the plague of Death of the Firstborn, which was executed by Hashem Himself, and not through Moshe, as we say in the Haggadah \"I, and not the messenger\". We therefore do not mention Moshe's role in the Haggadah, to teach us that everything was done by Hashem, and Moshe merely a servant fulfilling the will of his Master (<em>The Gr\"a</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Our Sages foresaw that there would arise future generations that would be lacking a leader to intercede on behalf of them. In order to prevent this from causing despair, it is fitting to remember at such times that also in Egypt the redemption did not come about via an angel or Divine messenger, and even Moshe was not with them at the time which they called out and Hashem heard their cries. It was Hashem Himself Who redeemed them then, and He will likewise redeem us in the near future (<em>Hagr\"i Mikloyzenberg</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Moshe in his humility did not want his name to be mentioned, and Hashem did his bidding (<em>The Chofetz Chaim</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>The night of Pesach corresponds to the level of \"Issarusa De'leayla\" (an arousal from Above), as the Jews were redeemed despite being entrenched in the lowest levels of impurity. As Moshe represents the level of \"Issarusa Delesata\" (a revelation that comes about only through prior effort) his name is not mentioned (<em>Maharam Mibulgurya</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Moshe did not want to accept the task of taking the Jews out of Egypt.

How much did this baby goat go for in USD?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>It's virtually impossible to compare money from such a long time ago.</p>\n\n<p>Common comparisons are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Value of precious metal.</li>\n<li>Cost of a days meal.</li>\n<li>Days labor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each measure will give you a different number. For a goat probably a days labor is the best measure, since that's what you would have to do to get one.</p>\n\n<p>A day laborer (unskilled) in those days would earn about one <em>denarius</em> (same as a zuz) per day.</p>\n\n<p>Federal minimum wage in the US for a days labor is about $58, so your goat cost about $116. Although practically speaking most people can expect more since state minimum wage is higher, and someone earning minimum wage with a family (which is comparable to the situation back then) would get a large refund on their tax return. So the real number is probably higher.</p>\n\n<p>Precious metal price you already know: $7.50.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of food a Zuz is worth about $20 according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarii\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>. So $40 in that case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Well first you need to determine what a Zuz is worth.  <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/KETUBAH.pdf\">Here is an article specifically talking about the 200Zuz of a Ketubah and it's various understandings, from $750-$1,000,000.</a>  Current custom in Israel is to not evaluate the actual worth of Talmudic coins but to equate it to purchasing power, technically known as relative worth.  <a href=\"http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/\">You can see this in action with US Dollars here</a>.  According to the Rabbinate the current relative worth of 200zuz is equivalent to $50000USD <a href=\"http://www.lawguide.co.il/articles/1119/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93%D7%94-%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%94-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%99-_9295/\">which is explained here</a>.  Coinicidentally this past October I was maseder kiddushin in the US.  I asked Rav Ovadia Yosef before I wrote the Ketubah, if the $50k stipulation should also be included in an American Ketubah, where it wasn't mandated by state law and there were differing opinions concerning the value of a Zuz and he told me that it should still be written explicitly that 200zuz is equal to $50000USD.  </p>\n\n<p>So 50000/200=250.  250*2=500.  So 2zuz is $500(or possibly considerably less if you follow another valid opinion).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Chaim_Naeh\">R' Chaim Naeh</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20888&st=&pgnum=354\">Shiurey Torah 3:42</a>), one Talmudic Zuz is 4.8 grams of silver (he writes that a perutah is 1/40th of a gram of silver, and that a Dinar/Zuz = 192 perutas.) WolframAlpha <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4.8%20grams%20of%20silver%20in%20usd\">calculates</a> that to be $4.40 USD at the time of this post, or $8.80 for two Zuz.</p>\n\n<p>As you mention in the question, there are two types of Zuz. The above calculation is for pure Zuz. Rashi there explains that 8 \"Zuz Medina\" are equal to one real Zuz, thus 2 Zuz Medina would be $1.1 USD.</p>\n\n<p>However, all this is regarding the meaning of Zuz in Talmud. R' Chaim Naeh points out (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20888&st=&pgnum=161\">Shiurey Torah Siman 1 footnote 21</a>) that in the later Halachic works (\"Poskim\"), the term Zuz was used loosely for whatever coin their country happened to use. Chad Gadya is attributed to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_of_Worms\">Rokeach</a>, so it may have referring to German currency.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Allowing the forbidden for the sake of a Mitzvah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are a few <em>mitzvot</em> which are effected through the use of that which is specifically forbidden. The first two examples are of <em>tzitzit</em> being <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/4049/1362\">made</a> from <em>shatnez</em> and the <em>mei</em> <a href=\"http://www.webshas.org/baisdin/powers/sotah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>sotah</em></a> being infused with the ink from <a href=\"http://www.tfdixie.com/parshat/naso/014.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">erasing</a> the <em>shem hashem</em>. In an associated sense, we are <em>mikayem</em> the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>matzah</em> through the use of a flour/water mixture which would be otherwise forbidden on <em>pesach</em> (though it is not precisely parallel). An even further extension might be that a <em>kohen gadol</em> or a <em>nazir</em> can be <em>metameh</em> himself for a <em>met mitzvah</em> (Mishna Nazir 7:1, \"A <em>Kohen Gadol</em> and a <em>nazir</em> do not render themselves ritually impure for their relatives, but they may become impure for a \"<em>met mitzva</em>\"\") And as a logical end, we have that <em>pikuach nefesh</em> pushes off <a href=\"http://www.ishtetl.com/index.php?/topic/3721-pikuach-nefesh-on-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">everything</a> and <em>safek nefashos</em> pushes off <em><a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/points/yo-ps-084.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shabbos</a></em>. But I am looking more at the specific <em>mitzvot</em> which override specific laws, not just ones which allow us to push off 'all' that is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Are there other specific <em>mizvot</em> which are fulfilled through an action or a thing which would otherwise be forbidden?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The best example is Yibum, in which the brother of a dead husband (died without children) marries his widow. It is normally forbidden to marry one's sister-in-law. Another example is the belt of the Priestly Vestments which is made of both wool and linen, meaning that it is sha'atnez (according to some opinions). Furthermore, an example would be the mitzva of Metzora (person with \"leprosy\") shaving his head at the completion thereof. This would normally be in violation of the commandment to not round out the corners of one's head. </p>\n\n<p>As an aside, there is no prohibition against flour/water mixtures on Pesach, only against leavened dough and bread. </p>\n\n<p>There is another category of commandments, which become permissible when you do them but were prohibited up until that point. The best example of this is the קרבן עומר, the first sacrifice brought from new grain (brought on the 16th of Nisan). Before the sacrifice, חדש is prohibited. Afterward it is permitted. The sacrifice itself is what makes it permissible. </p>\n\n<p>There is much more to be said on this topic, but we don't have the time/space for several שיעורים on מסכת יבמות. If you would like to look into it, the places to start are .יבמות ג:–ח and .נזיר לט:–מב and .מנחות ה:–ו. There are also a significant amount of ראשנים and אחרונים on this very subject.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to Seth J for pointing out what is left out of my answer. The most famous case in which a mitzva pushes off only some of a prohibition is the prohibition of טומאה in the בית המקדש, and the mitzva that all קרבנות need to be done on time. In the case that there is unavoidable טומאה at hand, the rule is טומאה דחויה בציבור, i.e. the impurity is <em>pushed off</em>, but it is not <em>permitted</em> (known as טומאה הותרה בציבור). This means that we do what needs to be done even though the כהנים or the כלים are טמאים, but we are careful not to do anything extra. The other side of this argument would say that once we are letting טומאה into the מקדש, its all מותר.</p>\n\n\n",

Of course, in the latter, each passage of the Haggadah has several commentators' writings.</p>\n\n<p>My personal feeling is that a Haggadah's commentary ought to be engaging to the reader, however long it may be. To the point, the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9657108381\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nechama Leibowitz Haggadah</a>, which my wife favors, is 159 total pages and contains, \"over 100 analytical questions relating to the Passover Seder and the Exodus from Egypt...extracted from Nechama's renowned weekly Torah study sheets.\"  Yet its style keeps the reader engaged, and it can be used to study from in preparation for the Seder or to pull up a quick Devar Torah at the Seder itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Two things.  First the various commentaries vary greatly in length.

The same can be said with the various commentaries by famous Rabbanim through the ages.</p>\n\n<p>As far as publishing, you will find that most often these are self-published.  I don't know of a commentary that was published in the lifetime of the Rav by a publisher.  Usually the individual pays for their own publication and distribution.  In a few generations when it has become a classic(G-d willing) a publisher may pick it up.</p>\n\n\n",

According to many poskim, removing a tattoo involves \"wounding\" yourself.  Therefore, it is generally prohibited to a Jew to inflict pain upon himself in order to remove the tatoo.  This is why you see many Jewish survivors of the death camps still wearing the numbers that the Nazis tatooed on their arms.  Rabbi Hanoach Teller, in his book, \"It's a Small World,\" tells a nice story about a Jew who had become a baal tshuva and went to a men's mikvah, but was embarrassed to show his naked body with many tatoos.  An older man broke the silence and, showing him the numbers on his forearm, said, \"see, I have a tatoo, also.\"  Based on this, and the fact that a good friend of mine, Dr. Clifton Price, zt'l, a ger tzedek of amazing merit, who had a tatoo that described him as \"Slim,\" I see no basis for denying conversion to a person because he had a tatoo when he was not Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>There are sources that say it is permitted to have a tatoo removed, however.  Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, zt'l, held that a young woman who wanted to increase her marriage prospects was permitted to undergo cosmetic surgery although she would be causing wounds to be inflicted on her. He permitted it, since the surgery is done with her will and is essentially for her good.  Iggrot Moshe, Choshen Mishpat 2:66.

Rabbi Feinstein cites this, and a ruling by Maimonides, Rambam, Hilchot <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/b405.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chovel U'Mazik 5:1</a>, as coroboration of his ruling.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/14-21%20Permanent%20and%20Semi-Permanent%20Makeup%20-%20Cosmetic%20Tattooing%203.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>, Rav Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron (Techumin 22:387) viewed the removal of a tattoo as a meritorious act to avoid remembering a previous sinful life.

But the Torah, at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9924/jewish/Chapter-23.htm\">Lev. 23:5</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0212.htm#8\">Exodus 12</a> describes \"Passover\" or \"Pesach\" as the day the Pesach offering was brought in the Temple -- the 14th of Nisan -- and Lev. 23:6-7 tells us that the Festival of Matzos begins on the following night (the 15th of Nisan) and continues for seven days.  During the first night (15th of Nisan), the Torah commanded the Jewish people to eat the Pesach offering made the afternoon before (on the 14th of Nisan).  Exodus 12:6-8.  Also, during the first night of the Festival of Matzos we were to retell the story of our redemption from Egypt.  </p>\n\n<p>Since all of these things occurred on what the Torah calls the Festival of Matzos, why do we call the festival \"Passover\" instead of by its Biblical name?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>We see that G-d calls it \"Chag HaMatzot\" and we call it \"Chag HaPesach\".</p>\n\n<p>G-d calls it Chag HaMatzot (In the Torah) to express praise of the Jews. They left Egypt with only some dough, so great was their faith in G-d. G-d calls it Chag HaMatzot to celebrate that fact.</p>\n\n<p>The Jews call it \"Chag HaPesach\" to celebrate the fact that G-d passed over the Jews houses when he unleashed the plague of the firstborn.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41319&pgnum=188\">Sefer HaToda'ah quotes this</a> in the name of R' Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16025&st=&pgnum=88&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> explained (homoleticaly) that since Pesach is the birth of the Jewish people, it's names represents three stages in it's birth.</p>\n\n<p>The first is Chag Hamatzos - when a person starts learning Torah, he must start with bittul - nullification (like Matzas). So too, when Jews left Mitzrayim, they had to have bittul to remove their previous negative traits.</p>\n\n<p>The second is Zman Cheiruseinu - after this nullification, one must actually understand what he learns, and must come to the understanding his teacher has. One must be a \"yesh\" to accomplish this. So too, it's not enough to keep Torah and Mitzvos in a broken manner. One must be \"free\" and <em>enjoy</em> Torah and Mitzvos.</p>\n\n<p>The third is Pesach - that one must jump above his \"natural\" level and reach the level that even when one keeps Torah and mitzvos in a \"broken\" and \"limited\" manner, he is still above limitations through \"jumping\".</p>\n\n\n",

And, to his credit, it was an accident caused by real curiosity. </p>\n\n<p>Is it OK to repair something like this simply by scotch-taping it? Or is there another way we should get it repaired?\nOr should we dispose of it <em>(and if so, what's the proper way?)</em> and get him a new one?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Since they are together as a single scroll this poses a complex problem the Rashba brings a Teshuva regarding books of the chumash that were written separately and without being done leshem kedusha(which would in any even possul the sefer Torah from being used) part 1 chapter 144 writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם הם כגולל וכתקנן, הרי הם בספר תורה לכל דבריהם, אלא שאין קורין בהם\n  בצבור, מפני כבוד הצבור בלבד.</p>\n  \n  <p>If they are rolled and attached, behold they are a Sefer Torah in all\n  respects, only we do not read from them in front of the congregation,\n  and that is only on account of the honor of the congregation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Taz(Y\"D 271:8) and the Beur Halakha aka the Chafetz Chaim(83:5) also seem to regard printed seforim, on an equal level of holiness with scribed seforim, and thus the above worries of the Rashba would apply.</p>\n\n<p>From an article on <a href=\"http://www.torah.org.il/advanced/weekly-halacha/5770/shlach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah.org regarding printed seforim</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With the advent of the printing press in the fifteenth century, the\n  Torah authorities of the time debated whether printed sefarim had the\n  same level of kedushah as handwritten works. The consensus of the\n  poskim was that a printed sefer is to be treated no differently from a\n  handwritten one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Further you have an interesting, even if widely rejected <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1525&st=&pgnum=359&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teshuva by Rav Abadi</a> that deems use of a printing press to actually be preferable to the use of scribe in writing a Sefer Torah.  Which if correct would leave only the issue of it being printed on paper as a possible disqualification of being a genuine Sefer Torah.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally Rav Ovadia Yosef wrote a lengthy Teshuva on the issue of these gift scrolls in his journal Or Torah from Av 5762, in which he goes through the various opinions regarding how the scrolls should be treated, and whether damaging them is on the same level as damaging an actual sefer Torah.  It's really worth a read if you can get hold of it.  In short he goes back and forth and ends with, those who are stringent will merit a blessing, but doesn't actually settle on a final decision in that regard.  Regarding what to do with however, he says clearly that it is necessary to entomb it.</p>\n\n<p>In that respect, regarding whether it can be fixed, it would depend on where the rip took place.  If it happned in the margin, then, like a normal Torah Scroll it could be fixed.  If it tore through the words, while technically one could replace the torn panel, it would seem by and large it cannot be fixed and would have to be entombed just as an irreparable Sefer Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Whether one needs to fast and such as is normal when damaging an actual Sefer Torah, again from this it would seem that such is the case, however one should ask a reliable posek.</p>\n\n\n",

In either case we'd expect Hebrew the text is an instruction manual for relatively learned individuals--who would convey the essence of the message to those less learned. So again, Hebrew is not unexpected. The few Aramaic passages are either aimed directly at the masses\n(Ha lachma) or kids ( chad gadya). The latter is very late in origin and the Aramaic may have been for effect rather than comprehension.</p>\n\n\n",

However, most scholars agree that the Biblical geographic area referred to as Cush/Ethiopia was not only in the location of present-day Ethiopia, rather it spanned Northwest of present-day Ethiopia, including parts of the areas of present-day Ethiopia, Egypt, Somalia, Nubia, Eritrea, and the Sudan. The Midrash says (Exodus Rabbah,§10) that the plague of the frogs settled a border dispute between Egypt and Cush because the frogs did not pass the border, which showed where exactly the boundaries of each country laid. Indeed, it will be evident later that Cush was near Egypt. Nonetheless, Rashi (to Yoma 81b) translates \"Land of Hindu\" as the land of Kush. From here one sees that the terms \"Kush\" used does not necessarily always mean Ethiopia. In the beginning of the book of Esther (1:1), Scripture establishes that Ahasuerus was king from Hodu to Kush. The Talmud records (Megillah 11a) that Rav and Shmuel disputed whether Hodu and Kush are close to each other (Shmuel) or far from each other (Rav). The accepted translation of Hodu is India. If one is to assume that Kush refers to Ethiopia, how then could Shmuel say that Kush was close in geographical proximity to India? Rabbi Yaakov Emden (1697-1776) answers (see Hagahos Ya'avetz to Megillah 11a) that there are two places known as Kush. One \"Kush\" is in Africa and was Ethiopia, while the other \"Kush\" is in Asia was close to India. The dispute between Rav and Shmuel was which \"Kush\" the Torah referring to in describing the boundaries of Ahasuerus' rule. Indeed, an Asiatic mountain range known as \"Hindu Kush\" runs along the Pakistani-Afghan border.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The essay explores many possible interpretations of Moshe's wife being called a \"Cushite\". Many explain that she was not actually Ethiopian, but was described as a \"Cushite\" as an expression of her beauty (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/true/aid/9940/jewish/Chapter-12.htm#v1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Numbers 12:1</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>i find it interesting that people will quote sources from commentators thousands of years after the Tanakh, and historians later still, but no one points to a pretty clear Biblical reference on using Cushi to have it refer specifically to someone of a particular skin color:</p>\n\n<p>Jeremiah 13:23\nכג  הֲיַהֲפֹךְ כּוּשִׁי עוֹרוֹ, וְנָמֵר חֲבַרְבֻּרֹתָיו; גַּם-אַתֶּם תּוּכְלוּ לְהֵיטִיב, לִמֻּדֵי הָרֵעַ.  23 \nCan the Cushite change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</p>\n\n<p>So it is definitely fair to assume that Cushi can mean someone who is black (or dark) skinned.

It says in the Mishnah (Perek 1 Mishnah 8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היתר נדרים פורחין באויר ואין להם על מה שיסמכו הלכות שבת חגיגות\n  והמעילות הרי הם כהררים התלוין בשערה שהן מקרא מועט והלכות מרובות הדינין\n  והעבודות הטהרות והטמאות ועריות יש להן על מה שיסמכו והן הן גופי תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In regards to the first statement that \"Heter Nedarim\" are \"porchim b'avir\" Rashi says that the ability of a Chacham to be matir a neder has a remez (hint) in the Torah, however doesn't have anything to \"rely\" on (lismoch) from the Torah (to say that it's m'doraisa. However there is a remez and the whole halacha was given over to the Chachamim in the Torah Shel b'Peh. This is a similar idea of what some Rishonim hold about Chol HaMoed that it is from the Torah however was given over to the Chachamim to decide what is muter or ossur. The person wanted to say that you see since the Mishnah didn't give hilchos Chol HaMoed as an example (pointing out that Mesectas Chagigah is in Seder Moed and would have been more fitting to give an example that is relavant to Seder Moed>) must be that the issue of issur malacha on Chol HaMoed is in fact only a d'rabbanan. As well that it's not included in the last group of halachos that are listed which do have a \"smach\" in the Torah. Since it's not in the first and not in the last, must be only d'rabbanan altogether.</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>This also idea seems rather difficult to me. Is it possible to bring such a proof from the Mishnah in such a way (specifically this idea and this Mishnah.) Is this way of learning from a Mishnah have any source or foundation? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As you your self postulate, you cannot bring a proof from a missing clause in a Mishna, as we have the rule of תנא ושייר - a Tana can leave out cases. </p>\n\n<p>(Typically followed up with  מאי שייר דהאי שייר שייר - what esle did you leave out, as there's always more than one clause left out, if somethig is left out.)</p>\n\n<p>By the way: The Gemara in חגיגה on .דף יח seems to make it clear - from multiple Pesukim - that work on Chol HaMoed is d'Oraisa, yet Tosafos there claim that these are all Asmachtot. Hard to beleive that Tosafos would contradict a \"proof from a Mishna\" in the same Masechet.</p>\n\n\n",

He goes through many proofs and pushes some away however ends off that one should be \"machmir\" to have arba cosos for every person.</p>\n\n<p>What is the sofek of Tosfos exactly? Why is it that he doesn't find it so simple that for each person to fulfill the mitzvbah of arba cosos he must drink every cos? Why does he seem to compare (all arba cosos) to that of Kiddush the whole year that one may say the kiddush, drink the wine and everyone is yotzee with him.</p>\n\n<p>I had seen brought down from the Gaonim that the arba cosos of the Pesach Seder are a \"chovo\" and impossible to <em>not</em> drink them (See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22172&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> brought down in Gilonei HaShas from R' Yosef Engel)</p>\n\n<p>As well the Gemorah in Pesachim Daf 117b says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ארבע כסי תיקנו רבנן דרך חירות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How is one able to fullfill the inyun of \"derech cheres\" without drinking the cos?</p>\n\n<p>So again, what is causing Tosfos to entertain this idea, where is he getting it from, what's his savarah? I have heard that the later achronim (Chazzon Ish, Har Tzvi, HaRav Pinchus Sheinberg ZT\"L) have a derech in this however it's difficult for me to understand.

    "content": "# Must one be able to taste the matzah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says in the Gemorah Pesachim Daf 115a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבינא אמר לי רב משרשיא בריה דרב נתן הכי אמר הלל משמיה דגמרא לא\n  ניכרוך איניש מצה ומרור בהדי הדדי וניכול משום דסבירא לן מצה בזמן הזה\n  דאורייתא ומרור דרבנן ואתי מרור דרבנן ומבטיל ליה למצה דאורייתא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that a person shouldn't eat matzah and maror together b'zman ha'zeh (nowadays) since the taste of the maror will be mvatel (cancel) the taste of the matzah. The chiyuv (requirement) of maror which is m'drabbanan will be m'vatel (in taste) that of the chiyuv of matzah that is m'doraisa. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemorah says on Daf 115b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבא בלע מצה יצא בלע מרור לא יצא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that if one swallows matzah whole they are <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/608\">yotzee</a> (however if they swallow maror whole they are not yotzee).</p>\n\n<p>We see from the Gemorah on Daf 115a that one needs to taste the matzah, so why then does the Gemorah say on Daf 115b that you would be yotzee in a case of swallowing where you seemingly wouldn't taste the matzah (wee this idea from the fact that maror you aren't yotzee.) Or perhaps the question could be asked the other way. It says in Daf 115b that if you swallow the matzah you are yotzee (we see then that you don't need to be feel the taste.) However from the Gemorah on Daf 115a it would seem that you do (since the taste of the maror will be m'vatel the taste of the matzah.) How can this contradiction be addressed? Are there any maforshim that speak about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is a כלל in the Talmud, כל הראוי לבילה, בילה מעכבת בו, כל שאין ראוי לבילה, בילה מעכבת בו. I.e. if there is an action required to be done (as part of a chain of actions), as long as one is able to do so, one does not need to actually do it. But if it cannot be done, the entire chain of actions is invalidated. The Gemara above speaks of a קרבן מנחה, which cannot be brought in a volume over 60 kav, because it cannot be mixed with the oil. Yet if the מנחה is brought less that 60 kav, it does not even need to be mixed, as stated above.</p>\n\n<p>It could be that the taste of the matza is like the mixing of the מנחה, that it is only מעכב if it can't be done. Therefore if you eat it with מרור, the מרור will definitely prevent you from tasting the matza, you aren'e יוצא.</p>\n\n<p>The same would not apply for מרור, being that the taste is not \"a stage in the process\" of the מצוה, but the whole point of eating the מרור is tasting the bitterness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a simple explanation. Rava, who holds on 115b that you can swallow <em>matzah</em> whole (presumably because you don't need to taste it) argues with Ravina's ruling on 115a that the taste of the <em>maror</em> would nullify the taste of the <em>matzah</em> if they're eaten together.</p>\n\n<p>His very next words in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.115b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 115b</a> after your quote are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בלע מצה ומרור ידי מצה יצא ידי מרור לא יצא</p>\n  \n  <p>If he swallowed <em>matzah</em> and <em>maror</em> together, he has fulfilled the obligation to eat <em>matzah</em> but not <em>maror</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Pesachim.115b.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יצא ידי מצה שאינה צריכה טעם</p>\n  \n  <p>He fulfills the obligation to eat <em>matzah</em> because it does not need to be tasted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The discourse explains that on a superficial level, the Jewish people were considered lower than the sea, and it would not split for them. It was specifically due to this \"spark of Moshe\" contained in every Jewish soul  - representing the \"<em>penimyos</em>\"; the deepest and highest levels of the soul - that the Jews are considered higher than the sea, and caused it to split.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is further developed by the Rebbe Maharash (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15796&st=&pgnum=83\" rel=\"nofollow\">Likkutey Torah Toras Shmuel 5631 vol. 1 pg. 157</a>) who connects it to what is explained in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/369670/jewish/-.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanya Chapter 42</a> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7921/jewish/Chapter-42.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">english link</a>): In Parshas Eikev (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9974#v12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 10:12</a>) Moshe asks the Jewish people, \"And now, Israel, what does the L‑rd your G‑d require of you?

Answers the Gemara: “Yes, in the case of Moshe it is a small thing.”</p>\n\n<p>At first glance the answer of the Gemara is incomprehensible, for the verse asks, “What does Hashem require of <em>you</em>?” — i.e., What does G‑d require of every Jew? For the majority of Jews, fear of G‑d is certainly no mean accomplishment. What, then, is the point of answering that <em>for Moshe</em> it is a simple thing? Chassidus therefore explains that the answer of the Gemara does not refer to Moses alone, but to the “Moshe” which is found in every Jew.

    "content": "# Is there a concept in Jewish law similar to a corporation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In modern law, a corporation, according to Black's Law Dictionary, is an \"artificial person or legal entity created by or under the authority of the laws of a state or nation . . . ordinarily consisting of an association of numerous individuals.\"  Assuming that the corporation has its own assets, a creditor who has done business with the corporation, or a tort claimant, may only collect from the assets of the corporation, and not its members or shareholders.  The corporation's own liability and structure effectively shields its shareholders from personal liability for the debts of the corporation, unlike a partnership whose members are legally required to make good the debts of the partnership if the assets of the partnership are insufficient.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything comparable in Jewish law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1139985##\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> by Rabbi Dr. Michael Broyde and Prof. Steven Resnicoff cited by Isaac Moses in his comment to the question, there is a brief summary at page 2, followed by discussion and sources.  See the original text for footnotes.  They write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sparse literature on the relationship between corporate ownership and Jewish law obligations reflects the following five principal positions: </p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>The \"Jewish law (halakhic) entity\" approach. This view maintains that Jewish law deems a corporation to be an independent entity that owns its assets and conducts its business. According to this view, shareholders do not own title to the corporate assets and are not in violation of Jewish law when the corporation commits a forbidden act.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The \"halakhic partnership\" approach. There are three versions of this view. The first contends that Jewish\n  law recognizes a corporation as a partnership (shutfut). The shareholders are regarded as partners who own a percentage\n  interest of the corporate assets. A second version maintains that Jewish shareholders are partners only if the corporation\n  has primarily Jewish shareholders. A third alternative describes Jewish shareholders as partners only if they own voting\n  shares.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The \"halakhic creditor\" approach. Some authorities who espouse the second or third versions of the halakhic\n  partnership theory believe that Jewish shareholders who are not partners are, instead, creditors who have loaned money\n  to the corporation or to the corporation's managers. n21 As creditors, such shareholders would not be responsible under\n  Jewish law for the corporation's conduct.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The \"purchaser of entitlements\" approach. At least one authority suggests that in many instances a Jewish shareholder\n  is merely a purchaser of certain financial benefits vis-a-vis the corporation's future profits. </p></li>\n  <li>The \"relationship\" approach. Some authorities do not use a single label to describe the abstract relationship between\n  Jewish shareholders, on the one hand, and corporate assets and activities, on the other. Instead, they examine diverse\n  aspects of the relationship and ask whether, as a whole, it constitutes ownership such as to implicate particular\n  Jewish law problems. Exponents of this approach consider, for example, the shareholders' ability and intention to control\n  corporate conduct and to use or sell corporate assets.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While this does not directly answer my question, it appears to indicate that there is no direct analogy to corporations in Jewish law, but instead these are accomodations that Jewish law has made to the existence of corporations in secular law.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Because the question does not ask about corporations per se, but about halakhic institutions that might be similar to it, the answer to that question is yes. There are a few such concepts that bear similarity to the modern legal definition of a corporation, without being partnerships (though none are exactly the same): </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Mamon Hashevet</strong>: when Terumah or Maaser was taken from produce, but the owner of the produce has yet to give it to an individual kohen/levi, the produce belongs to \"the collective tribe\". Rambam (Hil. Maaser 6:15-17) seems to indicate that the levite tribe is, in this sense, a corporate entity. However, R. Asher Weiss (Sh\"t 1:105-106) says that although there are differences between it and a normal partnership, that’s merely because in the case of the tribe, the human partners are unspecified, but it's actually nothing more than a partnership between all of the levites.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Mamon Aniim</strong>: Maharit (Y.D. 45) writes that money invested for the poor can be used to gain interest through loans, because nobody owns it, despite the fact that the money was set aside for the particular group of people. Mishneh Lamelech (Malvah VeLoveh Ch. 4) and Maharshag quote the Maharit, understanding that in his case, nobody owns the money at all. They might mean that the money is literally ownerless, but because of the mitzvah of tzedakah be required to be used in certain ways, or they might mean that no one person owns the money, but instead is owned by some other legal entity, which is exempt from usury.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tefisas HaBayis</strong>: an estate, which is the collective ownership of all of the legal heirs who inherit a deceased person's property. Some understand this to be no different than a partnership, but others, such as R. Elchanan to Bava Basra 126b, see it as a distinct legal entity that all of the inheritors are allowed to use, but do not own.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Communally Collected Funds</strong>: (1) R. Elchanan to Bava Basra 126b indicates that an estate and communal funds are distinct from partnerships, and such an idea is found in many achronim. R. Asher Weiss points out (aforementioned teshuvah) writes that this is not true, however, and collected communal funds must be considered a shared owndership, because a community-member is able to prohibit others from benefiting from his portion, implying that he fully owns his percentage of the funds (Nedarim 48a). </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Chevrah Hamanui al haPesach</strong>: a group of people who share a korban Pesach, before it is sacrificed, need to specify that this korban will be theirs, but many of the rules for this are different from normal rules of ownership. Thus, R. Menachem Zemba (Zera Avraham 4:21-24) says that the appointed group for Korban Pesach share in the ownership but are not partners, and implies that the korban is actually owned by an entity made up of all of members. However, ownership for the purposes of sacrifices is in many ways a totally different animal. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37473/what-is-the-halachic-status-of-a-corporation\">What is the halachic status of corporations?</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45381/corporations-jewish-shareholders-and-interest\">Are corporations with Jewish shareholders allowed to charge interest</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is  one way of viewing the gifts to the Priesthood as if they are owned by the entire Priesthood before they are given to one specific priest. If this is so, if one stole a gift that was to be given to a priest (for example, a first born sheep) (see Bava Metzia 6b), the person stolen from cannot claim for the return of the sheep, only the \"value of gratitude\", i.e. the amount a specific priest's gratitude is worth by giving it to him as opposed to another priest. Furthermore, the thief still has to give the sheep to a priest of his choice, but not of the choice of the one he stole from.</p>\n\n\n",

Typically a Beit Din, if there is a possibility that you are legitimately Jewish, will require that you hire a genealogist.  I worked for a while with  Vaad HaRabbonim Haolami LeInyonei Giyur under Rav Eliahshiv and have been a part of several cases with the Israeli Rabbinut(as an askan for Rav Ovadia Yosef) and that was the standard procedure.  Most commonly it was applied to Sem girls who wanted to marry in Israel and needed definitive genealogical proof of Judaism.  </p>\n\n<p>Almost every nation has birth, death and burial records going back hundreds of years.  All you would need is to connect the dots, matrilineally to someome buried in a Jewish graveyard(at a minimum).  In a case that I was a part of in Philadelphia twelve years ago with Rav Dov Brisman, we had a girl with a genealogists report that gave her matrilineal decent back 7 generations, and that sufficed.</p>\n\n<p>As far as Giyur L'Chumra, how recent(or not) the suspected claim of Judaism is that a Beit Din will want is entirely up to the Beit Din.  There is no halakha for it.  According to the Shulhan Arukh Y\"D 269(and thus the way of the Israeli Rabbinate) a Giyur L'Chumra is only done when there is a prior conversion by an unknown/unrecognized Beit Din, and then only under very specific circumstances.  I know that the Israeli Rabbinut has broadened(and at times restricted) that definition over the years.  For an understanding of that one would need to look in the various <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/962\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teshuvot in the Yaskil Avdei</a> starting with volume 4(that is when the Rav became the first president of Beit Din HaGadol), and the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/9119\" rel=\"nofollow\">various volumes of Piskei Din</a>.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Davar charif cut with meat knife -- why not ossur?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The SA in YD Siman 97 Sif 1 (the makor is a braisa in Pesachim Daf 30) says that one should not knead together a dough with milk, lest someone come to eat it together with meat. If one did knead them together, then one may not eat the bread, even by itself.</p>\n\n<p>The question was asked: Why wasn't a similar gezerah (prohibition) made in regards to a \"davar charif\" (something spicy; see beginning of SA YD Siman 96) that is cut with a \"meaty knife\", which would make that davar charif ossur to eat together with milk? Why wasn't a gezera made that one shouldn't cut the davar charif with a \"meaty knife\", lest they come to eat it with milk, and that after the fact we would say the davar charif would be ossur to eat by itself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>First it would seem you are not remembering 97:1 correctly.  There it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Do not knead dough with milk since (1) it may come to be eaten with meat. If milk is kneaded with dough, then the bread is assur 1) to eat\n  even on its own. However, if only a small amount of such bread is\n  made, for example one meal’s worth, or if the bread had a special\n  shape1 that would remind you not to eat it with meat, it is mutar.\n  Similarly, one should not bake bread in an oven that has been greased\n  with fat. If bread was baked in a greased oven [it is assur] for the\n  same reason as bread kneaded with milk.</strong>\n  <em>RAMA Therefore there is a custom to make bread with milk in it for Shavuos, also bread with shuman in it for kovod Shabbos since this is\n  considered a small amount 2 and its shape is different than that of\n  bread made during the week. Kol shecain phladan 3 or pashtaida is\n  mutar. 2) One should not bake bread with phladan or pashtaida in the\n  same oven since there is a concern that fat may leak onto the bread.\n  If the fat does leak under the bread it has the din of being kneaded\n  with fat. The custom is to put parve food in the opening of the oven\n  [when milk or meat are also being cooked]. (3) Even if the parve food\n  is in a pan the custom is to be strict l’chatchila.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You will notice from both the words of the Mechaber as well as the Rema that the worry is making large amounts of dairy bread without any sort of sign that they are dairy.  Not just dairy bread.  This is a technicality that every US Kashrut organization would relies upon to give heksherim to various dairy breads in the supermarket.  So long as it carries and OU(D) or OK(D) or whatever(D) that in and of itself is considered enough of a siman.  In Israel one can bake dairy bread so long as it is triangular(<a href=\"http://ajwnews.com/archives/16004\" rel=\"nofollow\">the reason for the mandated shapes of Bourekas by Rabbinut</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Now let us look at Y\"D 96:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A tznon or 1) silka5 that was cut with (1) a ben yomo 2) meat knife\n  or [a knife that] 3) wasn’t cleaned is assur to eat with milk unless\n  4) a k'dai natila, the width of the thumb, is removed from where the\n  it was cut (2) 5) or if it was tasted and did not taste of meat in\n  which case it is mutar [to eat with milk] after it is washed. (3)\n  V’yaish omrim 6) the same law applies even if the knife is an aino ben\n  yomo and clean. If the k’dai natila was not removed, nor was it even\n  tasted before it was cooked with milk, 7) then 60 is needed (4) 8)\n  against the area (5) that was cut. (6) The same din applies if the\n  knife of a non-Jew was used.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we see that for the davar charif to become \"meaty\" certain conditions have to be met.  First the knife must be ben yomo.  Second  the surface must be left in tact with an actual meat taste.  However, if it were to mixed with milk, even then you would only need 60x the surface area of the cut.  Negating either one of those conditions would mean that the davar charif is not meaty.  Unlike the bread which is impossible to make not dairy.</p>\n\n<p>As for the bread the concern was that one would make a quantity of bread(more than enough for a single meal), and thus the leftover may come to be eaten with meat.  For instance the minimum measure for taking challah would be enough quantity to make several large loaves, and thus in fact would be enough for several meals. Whereas with the davar charif, we are only worried about the surface of the cut, and then only if it has a discernable meaty taste after having been cut.  In short it would seem that Chazal was not worried about it being prepared in quantity enough for it ever be an actual concern.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, there are two divisions into twelve tribes each. Other examples — you mention the divvying up of the land and the tribal symbols — are the post-exodus desert travels (which was by tribe, with <em>Yosef</em> split and with <em>Levi</em> excluded from the configuration) and the blessings of <em>Yaakov</em> and <em>Moshe</em> (at the ends of Genesis and Deuteronomy, respectively, where <em>Yosef</em> was not split and <em>Levi</em> was included). I can't think of any situation in which all thirteen potential tribes (including <em>Levi</em>, <em>Efrayim</em>, and <em>M'nashe</em>) are included simultaneously. This explains the common reference to \"twelve tribes\". So your question \"what 12 tribes are usually meant?\" has, I think, no answer: either of the two possibilities, depending on context.</p>\n\n\n",

That doesn't take up a particularly significant percentage of Manhattan). For example, Australia doesn’t qualify as a walled city, or more extreme, the Americas don’t qualify because the wall isn’t specifically around the city.</p>\n\n<p>5)  We may not Pasken like Chizkiah. The Rambam, Shulchan Aruch, Tur, Rif, and Rosh all don’t bring the Din of Yamah Chomasah (possibly because we Pasken that we do learn out from Batei Arei Chomah/because we Pasken like Rebbi based on one of the final two answers and therefore Teveriah reads on 14th), the first big name to bring it is the Magen Avraham.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תשובה מאהבה חלק א' סי' ר\"י - ולכאורה צ\"ע דהרי\"ף והרמב\"ם והרא\"ש והטור וש\"ע השמיטו הך ספיקא דחזקי' אם הים חשוב חומה זולת המג\"א סי' תרפ\"ח סק\"ד מביאו להלכה פסוקה וכו' .</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>6)  Even if we do, it’s likely only a Middas Chassidus (based on the Geonim, unlike the Rambam).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ן על הרי\"ף מגילה סוף ב. - ולענין עיירות המסופקות אם הן מוקפין חומה מימות יהושע בן נון או לא הורו הגאונים ז\"ל שהולכין בהן אחר רוב עיירות שרובן אינן מוקפות חומה מימות יהושע וקורין בהן בי\"ד ועוד שאפילו תאמר שהוא ספק שקול ה\"ל ספק של דבריהם ולקולא ונמצא פטורות בשניהם ומבטל ממנו בודאי מקרא מגילה לפיכך קורא בראשון ופטור בשני <strong>ודאמרינן בגמרא [דף ה ב] אטבריא והוצל שהיו קורין בהן בארבעה עשר ובחמשה עשר במדת חסידות היו נוהגין כן משום ספקא דטבריא דתליא במגניא ומכסיא</strong> ובהוצל מפני שהיו נחלקין בה בקבלתו זה אומר מוקפת וזה אומר אינה מוקפת והיו קורין בלא ברכה דספק דדבריהם לא בעי ברוכי כדאיתא בפרק במה מדליקין [דף כג א] אלא שראוי לברך בארבעה עשר מפני שהולכין אחר רוב העולם והרמב\"ם ז\"ל כתב בפרק ה' מהלכות מגילה עיר שהיא ספק קורין בה בשני הימים ובליליהן אבל אין מברכין על קריאתה אלא בי\"ד הואיל והוא זמן קריאה לרוב העולם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>7) The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Scroll_of_Esther_and_Hanukkah.1.11?lang=he&p2=Maggid_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Scroll_of_Esther_and_Hanukkah.1.11&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maggid Mishneh</a> brings that some hold that the whole concept of reading on the 15th if you are unsure if the city was walled during the time of Yehoshua Bin Nun may not apply outside of Eretz Yisrael.

There he brings the Rambam who says the sofek is whether it was walled from the days of Joshua(not whether or not it was walled).  He also quotes the Gemarra in question.<br>\nThe footnotes of the Tur HaMaor(number 1 on that page) say that there is a machloket in the Gemarra as what made the sofek, whether it was the sea as a wall(which is one option).  The other option is that Tiberias is another city mentioned as walled(or not) in the book of Joshua.\nAssuming for now that it is the sea that causes the sofek, natural barriers(such as mountains and other things, which would also be a see) are spoken of in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=302\" rel=\"nofollow\">688:2 of the Shulhan Arukh</a>(as well as the Tur and Beit Yosef).  One of the issues we see there is that the natural barrier cannot be more then a mil from what was settled in the time of Yehoshua Bin Nun.  See the Mishneh Berurra seif katan 7 for further discussion on the distance.\nSo to answer your question.  Manhatten was not settled(by anyone) in the days of Yehoshua Bin Nun.  If the Mishnah Berurra didn't consider Europe settled in those days, certainly North America was not either.\nKythnos, would technically be possible, if the city covered enough of the island that no edge of it was more than a mil from the Ocean.  However looking at maps, it seems to actually a collection of small villages on a rather large island, and thus also would not work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would assume that even if the sea is considered part of the wall, that would only be in a case that there was a human-erected protective wall that took advantage of the sea on one side.</p>\n\n<p>However, a completely natural barrier would presumably not have the status of a walled city even if it would be considered a barrier for carrying on שבת. The logic would be that the wall needs to be an integral feature of the city. A natural formation is not related to the city perse.</p>\n\n\n",

Are there any <em>taamim</em> (explanations) that elucidate the significance behind this requirement? </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this law is an example of a chok, in which we cannot rationally deduce its meaning. Nevertheless, since our sages have always offered <em>taamim</em> to explain the deeper, mystical, or moral explanations of chukot, I was wondering if such has been offered regarding this difficult-to-understand halacha. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R' Shamshon Rafael Hirsch's approach to the dietary laws is excerpted in <a href=\"http://www.hir.org/a_weekly_gallery/3.25.11-weekly.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article by Rabbi Avi Weiss</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it possible that food could similarly impact on one's spiritual\n  well-being? This in fact is the position of Rabbi Samson Raphael\n  Hirsch in his explanation of kashrut (the dietary laws). </p>\n  \n  <p>The characteristics of kosher animals point to their being more\n  passive in nature. In Hirsch's words: \"If we look at the signs for\n  clean animals they appear plant-like. As they chew the cud, the food\n  consumed passes through two stomachs, is driven up the gullet again\n  and chewed for the second time. Thus, these animals spend a great deal\n  of time in the absorption of food. The cloven hooves of the permitted\n  animals also seem to have been created more for the mere purpose of\n  standing than for being used as weapons or tools.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>The same is true concerning fish. To be kosher, fish must have fins\n  and scales. (Leviticus 11:9) Not coincidentally, fish that have these\n  characteristics are by and large more peaceful in nature. The more\n  aggressive fish fall into the category of the prohibited. Moreover,\n  birds of prey are by and large enjoined. The rule holds fast. The more\n  aggressive animals and fowl are prohibited. The more passive are\n  permitted. </p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, not everyone who consumes kosher food leads lives of inner\n  peace. There are troubled people who eat kosher, just as there are\n  fine people who do not eat kosher. Nonetheless, the ritual of kashrut\n  may help us become more conscious of our responsibilities to live\n  ethical lives. </p>\n  \n  <p>The balance between outer action and inner feelings is especially\n  discernible in the laws of forbidden and permitted animals. Note, that\n  chewing the cud is an internal characteristic as it deals with the\n  inner digestive system. In contrast, cloven hooves are an external\n  characteristic. One merely has to look at an animal's foot to detect\n  whether this criteria has been met. Perhaps, just perhaps this teaches\n  that to be kosher one's behavior must not only be correct, but\n  inwardly pure. </p>\n  \n  <p>Whether these rationales are satisfactory or not, the prohibited foods\n  teach us discipline. They remind us that in the end, God is the\n  arbiter of right and wrong. Notwithstanding, the kashrut laws carry\n  powerful ethical lessons--lessons that can help ennoble and sanctify\n  our lives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (in Likkutei Sichos #1 p. 226) says that one it teaches on to \"ruminate\" over one's physical actions — i.e., over if and when should one do them. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Wikipedia article on Sefer Hachinuch\"><em>Sefer Hachinuch</em></a> 154 says that \"among the bases\" of this <em>mitzva</em> is the fact that meat from animals that don't chew their cud is unhealthful.</p>\n<p>He explains more fully in 73 (in my own loose translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among the bases for this command [of not eating an animal that was slaughtered and then found to have been close to death] is as follows. The body is a receptacle for the soul; through the body, the soul does its work. Without the body, the soul's work can never be completed. That's why it enters the body: for its own benefit (for God only does good, never bad). The body in the soul's hand is like the tongs in the blacksmith's, with which he makes things.</p>\n<p>Now, when the tongs are strong and well-aligned so it can grasp the items, the blacksmith can make good things; otherwise, the items being made will never come out good and nice. Likewise, when the body is missing anything, the intellect suffers accordingly. Therefore, the Torah banned all things that cause the body detriment. Along these lines we can explain simply the Torah prohibition on all forbidden foods; and if there is any among them such that we (and the doctors) don't know the damage they cause, don't be shocked: the Doctor who banned them is wiser. How foolish and confused is he who thinks the only damage in something is that which he comprehends!</p>\n<p>Know further that it's for our benefit that the damage in these foods was not revealed to us.

This came about approximately one week after Pesaḥ. Although I'm not totally sure, I think they must have followed the date observed in Israel, which is 27 Nisan. The particular date was of extreme importance to the organizers, however, because it was essential that all the various Jewish organizations joined together as one community to observe this solemn day, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living\" rel=\"nofollow\">March of the Living</a> was also scheduled around that date.</p>\n\n<p>In college, or more precisely, in Yeshivah, I learned that there was some early opposition from religious groups to establish a date for Yom HaShoah, since the fast of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_of_Tevet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tenth of Teveth</a> was considered the catch-all for Jewish national tragedies, as is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirat_Haomer#As_a_period_of_semi-mourning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefirah period</a>*.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, though, it seems that there are several other, non-religious, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_Remembrance_Day\" rel=\"nofollow\">internationally recognized</a> dates for Holocaust Remembrance.</p>\n\n<p>So what's going on exactly? What's the history of these divergent observances, and who actually observes them? It still seems to me that Yom HaShoah is the dominant date observed by most people, but is that really true? Recently there was some controversy over an offensive (allegedly antisemitic) cartoon published on one of these dates. It made waves because of the double impact of resembling a blood-libel cartoon from the Nazi era and being published on \"Holocaust Remembrance Day\" (I think the UN-sanctioned date). But other than its own distastefulness and offensiveness, was this really an issue for most people? I mean, did anyone who is not in tune with internationally-recognized holidays make this connection because they personally observe that date?</p>\n\n<p><sub>*(As explained to me, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Weeks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three Weeks</a>, etc., are regarded as unique dates of suffering, not to be associated with general tragedies that didn't befall the Jewish people on those specific dates.)</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>January 27th is probably the most universally accepted non-Jewish holocaust remembrance day.

It was officially established by Israel's Prime Minister and President in 1953. Most communities that have a dedicated Holocaust memorial service (generally \"Modern\" Orthodox) will do so on Yom HaShoah (27 Nissan), while those who remember the Holocaust together with other national tragedies (generally \"Yeshivish\" Orthodox) will do so on Tisha B'Av or Asara B'Tevet. Some communities will also hold educational events (but not specifically religious services) on Yom HaShoah.</p>\n\n<p>Many Jewish communities will hold educational and other non-religious events on the days designated by their host-countries as \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_Memorial_Days\" rel=\"nofollow\">Holocaust Memorial Day</a>\" or other days which may be locally designated as such or on the International Holocaust Remembrance Day (Janaury 27th). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This does not completely answer your question, but I see two parts in your question.  One, why a new date, Yom HaShoah, was selected as opposed to established national days of mourning, i.e., tisha b'av, and two, why this particular date.  As to the first question, and I don't have my sources available right now, although we do have established dates (the kinot on tisha b'av include references to the crusades, and it has long been noted that the expulsion from Spain occured on tisha b'av), I was told that the Holocaust was such a singular event that it was felt that it needed its own memorial day.  As to the selection of 27th of Nisan, I understand the \"original proposal was to hold Yom HaShoah on the 14th of Nisan, the anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising (April 19, 1943), but this was problematic because the 14th of Nisan is the day immediately before Pesach (Passover). The date was moved to the 27th of Nisan, which is eight days before Yom Ha'atzma'ut, or Israeli Independence Day.\" (quote from wikipedia).</p>\n\n\n",

There is a famous tshuva from the Chacham Tzvi, mentioned in the Mishnah Berurah, where he says a person made from the seffer yetzira is not a human, but rather an animal in the form of a human, therefore he cannot be counted for a minyan.

I am not referring to Niddah uncleanliness specifically, but am highlighting any uncleaness which a woman may come into contact from daily life including the uncleaness of men or women from an abnormal running discharge but in particular the uncleaness requiring daily bathing from the uncleaness which occurs from man and wife partaking in normal sexual relations.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rambam seems to provide an answer <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5104n.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות אסורי ביאה ד,ו</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל חַיָּבֵי טְבִילוֹת, טְבִילָתָן בַּיּוֹם:  חוּץ מִנִּדָּה\n  וְיוֹלֶדֶת--שֶׁהֲרֵי הוּא אוֹמֵר בַּנִּדָּה \"שִׁבְעַת יָמִים תִּהְיֶה\n  בְנִדָּתָהּ\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/a0315.htm#19\" rel=\"nofollow\">ויקרא טו,יט</a>), הַשִּׁבְעָה כֻּלָּן בְּנִדָּה\n  וְטוֹבֶלֶת בְּלֵיל שְׁמִינִי; וְכֵן יוֹלֶדֶת זָכָר בְּלֵיל שְׁמִינִי,\n  וְיוֹלֶדֶת נְקֵבָה בְּלֵיל חֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר, שֶׁהַיּוֹלֶדֶת\n  כַּנִּדָּה, כְּמוֹ שֶׁבֵּאַרְנוּ.</p>\n  \n  <p>All those who are required to immerse, their immersion is in the day:\n  other than the Niddah and one who gives birth -- as it says for the\n  Niddah \"seven days shall she be in her Niddah state\", the seven days\n  are all in the Niddah state and she immerses on the eighth night.<br>\n  Also one who gives birth to a male on the eighth night, and one who\n  gives birth to a female on the fifteenth night, as one who gives birth\n  is like a Niddah, as we explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later on in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5106n.htm#25\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות אסורי ביאה ו,כה</a> he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל אִשָּׁה שְׁהִיא סְפֵק נִדָּה סְפֵק זָבָה--צְרִיכָה לֵישֵׁב\n  שִׁבְעַת יְמֵי נְקִיִּים מִסָּפֵק, וְטוֹבֶלֶת בְּלֵיל שְׁמִינִי,\n  וְאַחַר כָּךְ תִּהְיֶה מֻתֶּרֶת לְבַעְלָהּ; וּמְבִיאָה קָרְבַּן זָבָה,\n  וְאֵינוּ נֶאֱכָל כְּמוֹ שֶׁיִּתְבָּאַר בִּמְקוֹמוֹ. </p>\n  \n  <p>Every woman whose state is unknown such that maybe she is a Niddah or\n  maybe she is a Zavah -- she must sit seven clean days due to the\n  doubt, and immerses on the eighth night, and afterwards is permitted\n  to her husband, and brings a Zavah sacrifice, which is not eaten as we\n  explain elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, the reason women usually immerse during the night is because the common practice today is to treat all women as if we don't know whether they are a Niddah or a Zavah.  For example, if a woman bleeds for three nights, maybe all three where Zavah days, and so she must count seven clean days after the bleeding stops.  She immerses on the morning of the seventh day and is permitted to her husband on the eighth night.  But what if the third day was a Niddah day?  Then in that specific case she must wait six more days and immerse on the seventh night after the bleeding stopped and is permitted to her husband - the night before when she would immerse if she was a Zavah.  So there is allot of potential confusion as to when the right time to immerse is and the we get to this in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5104.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות אסורי ביאה ד,ז</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נתאחרה ימים רבים ולא טבלה--כשתטבול, לא תטבול אלא בלילה:  שאם תטבול\n  ביום, יטעו ותבוא נידה אחרת לטבול בשביעי.  [ח] הייתה חולה, או שהיה מקום\n  הטבילה רחוק ואין הנשים יכולות להגיע לו ולחזור בלילה מפני הליסטים, או\n  מפני הצינה, או מפני שנועלין שערי המדינה בלילה--הרי זו טובלת ביום\n  השמיני, או בימים של אחריו ביום.</p>\n  \n  <p>If her immersion has been delayed many days -- when she immerses, she\n  immerses only at night: that if she would immerse during the day, they\n  will make a mistake and some other Niddah will come and immerse on the\n  seventh day.  If she was sick, or if the place of immersion was far\n  away and the women couldn't go and return at night because of bandits,\n  or due to modesty, or because the gates of the city are locked at\n  night -- then they immerse on the eighth day, or on one of the\n  following days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So take the common case today.  A typical woman bleeds for five days.  Common practice is to assume that we don't know if she is in her Niddah days or her Zavah days.  If she was in her Niddah days she would immerse on the eighth night after the bleeding started, the third night after it stopped.  But if she's a Zavah, she would immerse on the seventh day after it stopped, the twelfth day after it started.  But what if she is just really a Niddah?  Then her immersion \"has been delayed many days\" and she must immerse at night, and the first night available is the eighth night after the end of bleeding, the thirteenth night after the bleeding started.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me the key issue is the immersion not taking place at it's proper time, or at a doubtful time, and so we are stringent to avoid confusion.  Since we make the assumption of blanket uncertainty in current practice, so we don't immerse during the day unless there is a good reason to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I recently found the answer: Talmud Niddah 67b (soncino translation follows) in that women started bathing in the Evening following Rabbinic ruling that they should not bathe on the 8th day, lest their daughter see them and think they are bathing on the seventh day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rab ruled: If a menstruant performs immersion at 'the proper time  she may do it only at night  but if she performs it after the proper time  she may do it either in the day time or at night.1  R. Johanan ruled: Whether at the proper time or after the proper time a menstruant may perform immersion only at night, on account of the possibility of her daughter's following her lead. Rab, moreover, also withdrew his ruling; for R. Hiyya b. Ashi citing Rab laid down: Whether at the proper time or after the proper time  a menstruant may perform immersion only at night on account of the possibility of her daughter's following her lead…</p>\n<p>Said R. Papa to Raba,  Consider: At the present time the Rabbis have put all menstruants on the same level as zabahs,  why then should they not allow them  to perform immersion in the daytime of the seventh day?  — This cannot be allowed on account of the following ruling of R. Simeon. For it was taught: After that she shall be clean,  'after' means after all of them, implying that no uncleanness may intervene between them; but R. Simeon stated: After that she shall be clean  implies that after the act  she shall  be clean, but the Sages have ruled that it was forbidden to do so in case she might thereby land in a doubtful situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Perhaps one reason why a quote such as the one you saw became popular was due to the publication of an English version of the book (available <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/37435\">here</a>) in 1859 under the title \"A Choice of Pearls\", translated by B. H. Ascher.</p>\n\n<p>The first chapter of the book is concerning the nature of wisdom, written in the style of questions asked to a wise man and his pearls of wisdom offered in return. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37435&st=&pgnum=30&hilite=\">One of the the wise man's sayings</a> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.ואמר תחלת החכמה שתיקה. שניה לה שמיעה \n   .שלישית זכרון. רביעית מעשה. חמישית מורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ascher <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37435&st=&pgnum=31\">translates this</a> as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first step to wisdom is silence; the second \n  attention; the third memory ; the fourth activity; the \n  fifth study.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This translation is similar to the quote you have above, except for the fifth step, in which Ascher translates \"מורה\" as \"study\", which is not how I would translate it, which would be more in line with your version: \"teaching\". [I have no access to the original Arabic, nor would I understand it even if I did, so I'm trusting Ibn Tibbon's translation.] It's odd, because in the Hebrew footnotes he compares with manuscripts that have \"למורה\" as the last word, which he clearly understands to mean \"to teach others\". Also, he cites one manuscript that has \"מודה\" (~\"acknowledgment\") instead of \"מורה\", in which case the fifth step would be something like \"acknowledge the truth\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a man marry a woman with the same name as his mother? (Or vice-versa?) How?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rabbi Yehudah Hechassid wrote in his testament (Testament of R. Yehudah Hechassid, sec. 23) that a man should not marry a woman whose name is the same as his mother’s, and a woman should not marry a man whose name is the same as her father’s. Some authorities say that this testament was only intended for Rabbi Yehudah Hechassid’s own descendants, and others argue that this is good advice for everyone (Piskei Dinim Tzemach Tzedek, Yoreh De’ah 116).  How do people hold these days?  Is a common name with a parent a deal-breaker, or is there a way around it, such as a name-change?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi JD Bleich is strongly opposed to the name-change business, it can create bona-fide halachic problems. Suppose Shprintza wants to get married, but her mother-in-law-elect is also named Shprintza. So we go through a name-change ceremony, she's not \"Shprintza\" anymore, she's \"Gendendel.\" Great. A few months or years later, people feel they've fulfilled their religious obligation and everyone starts calling her Shprintza again. If G-d forbid she'd ever need a Get, this becomes quite messy.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, in some Hassidic communities it's taken seriously; in Modern Orthodox circles it's ignored; for Litvish Yeshivish it probably depends on your circles. Someone asked Rabbi Moshe Feinstein about it -- \"may I marry so-and-so, but what about her mother's name...\" Rabbi Feinstein replied -- stuff like this, if it seriously bothers you, then you have to keep it; otherwise, you don't. If you're writing to me for a <em>heter</em>, that proves it doesn't seriously bother you, so go for it!</p>\n\n\n",

Rebbe Akiva Eager there writes that the Tur says one is permitted to \"prepare\". Rebbe Akiva Eager then says that the Tur is implies that even something that is a malacha, like cooking, may be done on Chol HaMoed for Yom Tov Sheini.</p>\n\n<p>In M\"B Sif-Katan 38, the author writes that we don't say \"yom tov sheini might really be a weekday and therefore it is <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/591\">ossur</a> to do something chol hamoed for its needs\". Rather, it is <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/591\">muter</a> to do something on Chol HaMoed for the purpose of Yom Tov Sheini.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: Is an Israeli keeping only 7 days of the Chag allowed to cook on Chol HaMoed for <em>someone else's</em> Yom Tov Sheini (which is Isru Chag for the one cooking)? Even though the Yom Tov Sheini will be a weekday for the one cooking, for the other person it's Yom Tov and would have the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/585\">heter</a> of the Rema and Rebbe Akiva Eager (with the explanation of the M\"B).

The meals may either be prepared by the two-day-er, prepared by the one-day-er after Yom Tov has ended for him/her, or the one-day-er may prepare excessively large portions of food for consumption on his/her last day of Yom Tov, with the leftovers being served the next day.</p>\n\n\n",

Many are seriously concerned about a slide from \"he's coming back as the messiah\" to \"he nullified himself to G-d so much that you can bow to a picture of him\" or the like. (For instance, if someone today follows Rabbi Eliezer's opinion, that a Mohel can drive on shabbos if necessary to perform a circumcision -- they're very clearly wrong, that debate was settled 1800 years ago.

    "content": "# How to handle cadavers\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My fiancée is going to university, working towards a degree in dentistry. For about a year, she will be required to handle cadavers in the classes. First of all, is this forbidden in Torah? Secondly, what sorts of purification will be required? Is it considered like niddah (i.e, will I be prohibited from marital intimacy?) I appreciate your answers on this. We are both new to Torah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>you've come to the right place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27734/21\">More on the subject here</a>, but in short:</p>\n\n<p>If someone is a [male] Kohen, they're prohibited from any additional contact with the dead -- thus it's problematic for a Kohen to handle cadavers. (If you have no particular reason to believe someone is a Kohen, we generally don't worry about it.)</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, today we're not usually concerned with the laws of ritual purity. Someone could be an undertaker or mortician and touch dead bodies all day long, that's fine. That means they can't enter the Temple or eat sacrifices, but that's kind of moot right now anyhow, so not to worry. Basically there's no purification today that's necessary (or even helpful -- it would require Red Heifer Ash which we don't have). Though many volunteers who prepare corpses for Jewish burial (known as <em>chevra kadisha</em> -- your fiance may consider joining) find it psychologically helpful to shower and put on clean clothes afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Nida is a very localized set of laws. Yes a Nida is not ritually pure, but we don't worry about that today. However, immersion is still needed specifically for the purposes of marital relations. A woman could be a mortician and touch a corpse Sunday through Friday, she'd still observe the laws of Nida -- and immersion -- like anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism does believe in treating a human corpse with a certain amount of respect, which includes leaving it intact barring strong reasons otherwise. (\"Strong reasons\" could include harvesting corneas postmortem, or an autopsy that could help find a serial killer on the loose.) We're thus not crazy about someone donating their body just for general medical research. However, your question is on the opposite side of the table, once the body has already been donated -- non-Kohen Jews routinely enter medical and dentistry school and study on cadavers. Years ago someone asked Rabbi Joseph Soloveichik about this, and he replied: \"would you trust a doctor who's never taken apart a real human body before? I wouldn't!\"  </p>\n\n<p>It would still be appropriate to show as much respect as possible, e.g. limiting side conversation and jokes while dissecting the cadaver.</p>\n\n\n",

How does this make sense grammatically? The <em>vav</em> is apparently unpronounced, as otherwise the word would be something like \"hiw.\" But then all we're left with is the <em>chirik-hei</em>, which on its own (without a trailing <em>yud</em>) is just \"hih,\" not \"hee.\" The only thing I can imagine is that it's like a <em>kri / kesiv,</em> where the <em>vav</em> is meant to be pronounced like a <em>yud.</em></p>\n\n<p>Can anyone offer some enlightenment about this unique word?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It should first be noted that the k'thiv/q'rei phenomenon you refer to is only observed in the Pentateuch and not elsewhere in Tanach.  That being said, there appear to be two major camps on this issue.  One camp believes along the lines of what you suggested, namely that הוא was actually written to mean היא.  The explanation is that waw and yod were used interchangeably when writing the third person pronoun.  If you think about it, a waw is basically a yod with a longer stem.  So even though הוא appears to be the same word, it actually represents both forms.  The forms הואה and היאה are found in Qumran texts.  Here is a source from this school of thought:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://josephprestonkirk.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/the-bible-and-the-dead-sea-scrolls.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Charlesworth</a></p>\n\n<p>The second school of thought is that there is no k'thiv/q'rei occurring.  The explanation is that one gender-neutral form for the third person pronoun existed in a more ancient form of the language.  This form would be written as הא using Hebrew lettering.  When medial vowels were introduced into Hebrew at a later stage, scribes erroneously extended  הא to הוא throughout the Masoretic text.  One argument for this school of thought is that Moabite and Phoenician inscriptions have been found bearing the early form of the pronoun הא.  A second argument against the k'thiv/q'rei argument is that this variation occurs 120 times in the Hebrew bible.  It would therefore seem unlikely that these are random scribal errors.

    "content": "# Eating Matzah of Tevel or Heqdesh\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As DoubleAA has reminded me, the Mishna in Pesachim 2:5 forbids the usage of matzah that is tevel or heqdesh on the evening of Pesach. In his commentary on Nedarim 2:2, however, the Bartenura appears to suggest that it is merely a mitzvah that comes from an 'aveirah. As none of the super-commentaries appear to have a problem with this, how best might one understand that passage in the Bartenura?</p>\n\n<p>For context, the mishna there says that one may make a vow that forbids him from utilising his sukkah, waving the four species and laying tefillin, but may not make an oath that prevents him from doing so (אמר: קונם סוכה שאני עושה, לולב שאני נוטל, תפלין שאני מניח - בנדרים אסור, בשבועות מותר שאין משבעין לעבור על המצות). Obviously, saying that one <i>may</i> vow to abstain from such things doesn't mean that one is necessarily permitted to do so, but that the vow stands.</p>\n\n<p>In his commentary on the Mishna, Rambam implies that one should nevertheless still sit in the sukkah, wave the four species and lay tefillin, but that this would then obligate him to bring a qorban. Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro explains similarly, and notes that it would be accounted a mitzvah that comes from an 'aveirah. To my confusion, the Bartinura then likens it to somebody who only has matzah of tevel or heqdesh on the evening of Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing as the mishna in Pesachim forbids one from utilising such matzah at all, why would the Bartenura suggest that it is similar to somebody who makes a vow that precludes him from using the sukkah, and who then uses it and brings a qorban?</p>\n\n\n",

In the former case, the heth would have the vowel hateph-pathah.  In the latter case, the heth would have the vowel qames.  In the former case, the feminine would be \"hizqi ubrukha tihyi\" (or briefly, \"hizqi ubrukha\"), while in the latter case the feminine would be \"hazaqa ubrukha tihyi\" (or briefly, \"hazaqa ubrukha\").  </p>\n\n<p>In Spanish-Portuguese custom, the response to \"hazaq ubarukh\" is \"barukh tihye\" (which is also the Ashkinazic response to \"yashar kohekha\").  In the Mizrahi custom, however, the response is \"hazaq we'emas\" (Joshua 1:6, Deuternomy 31:7).  In the response, hazaq is certainly a verb, which might suggest that it should be a verb also in the \"hazaq ubarukh\".  I have read (apologies that I don't have the reference), that the first indication of such a custom said that people would say only \"hazaq\", which suggests that it began as the verb.  </p>\n\n<p>I think the preponderance of the evidence is that the phrase began with \"hazaq\" as a verb, which would indicate we should say to a woman, \"hizqi ubrukha\".  However, whenever I have heard it in actual use, what was said was \"hazaqa ubrukha\".  I conclude from this that over time hazaq became understood as an adjective rather than a verb, and it is now so understood by the user community.  Thus, \"hazaqa ubrukha\" seems the most appropriate phrase.</p>\n\n<p>\"hazaqim ubrukhim!\" to you all. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps Hazaka u'vrucha?

Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/true/aid/9936/jewish/Chapter-8.htm#v3\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a> cites the Sifrei (1:5) that it was necessary for the Torah to advise us that Aahron in fact complied with the Divine instruction, for \"this shows Aaron’s virtue that he did not deviate [from God’s command]\". Many question why the mere fact that Aaron obeyed Hashem's command here is deemed so praiseworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berdichev explained as follows: For any ordinary person, fulfilling G-d's instruction would be nothing notable. However, for someone on the calibre of Aahron, who understood what was going on \"behind the scenes\", this was truly an exceptional achievement. Aaron was aware that the seven branches of the Menorah represented the seven different types of Middos (character traits) present in each Jewish soul, and his lighting of each candle affected the igniting of the Jewish souls. When faced with such a level of comprehension and appreciation of the task at hand, many would be so \"blown away\" that they could not perform the job satisfactorily; they would become so excited that they would spill the oil everywhere and not manage to light the candles. The greatness of Aahron was that in spite of his high level, he was still able to perform the job as required.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard people bringing this as an explanation to what happens to many \"Chassidic tales\". The Chassidim are so excited by the greatness they perceive of their Rebbeim, that their stories \"grow hands and feet\". There is no malicious intent of course, but they are simply unable to contain themselves to “stick to the facts”.

    "content": "# Not mentioning \"Pesach\" in after-bracha at the Seder (Or \"Shabbos\" by after-bracha by a Kiddush)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Added an additional case where the same question could be asked.</p>\n\n<p>It says in Shulchan Aruch 208:12 that when one makes an after-bracha after eating food for which the fore-bracha was \"mezonos\" or after drinking wine (for example) and it is Shabbos, Rosh Chodesh, or Yom Tov, then these days are mentioned in the after-bracha. The Mishna Brura writes there in note 58 that if one didn't mention these days in the after-bracha then they are <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/608\">yotzee</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/702\">b'dieved</a>. The Shaar HaTziun there, in note 60, points out that this is from the Magen Avraham and that the reason is that one wasn't required to eat this particular food on that day. He cites another reason: that there are those that hold anyway that one doesn't have to mention these days in the after-bracha.</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows: After drinking the last 2 cups of wine at the Pesach Seder, an after-bracha is made. If one didn't mention Pesach in the after-bracha, would they need to say it again? The reason I might think so is that one is in fact required to drink these two cups, thus obviating the first reason of the Shar HaTzion to not require repetition of the bracha. However according to the second reason I suppose one wouldn't have to make the bracha over again. Are there any <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1428\">poskim</a> who discuss this? Would, according to the first reason that the Shar HaTzion brings down, a person have to make the bracha again?</p>\n\n<p>Similarly the question could be asked in regards to the bracha made after eating Mezonos by a Kiddush on Shabbos. Since this is technically considered to be his \"seudah\" (in that he made Kiddush and now needs to have a seudah in order for the kiddush to be good.) that is he had a chiyuv to eat. If he left out \"Shabbos\" from the bracha that he makes afterward would he have to say the bracha over again? Seemingly it's dependent on the 2 reasons the Shar HaTzion brings and perhaps would say since many hold you don't need to mention the day at all then over here in this case we would be rely on that opinion to not say the bracha over again. Are there poskim that discussed this case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is an obligation to drink wine, but there is no obligation to drink a Revi'es of wine - one fulfills his obligation with a majority of a Revi'es (see Siman 472:9 Mishnah Berura 30, and Be'ur Halacha s.v.

The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2502.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Brochos 2:10</a>) implies that when there is a new person present who has not yet <em>heard</em> the Sheva Brochos he becomes obligated to say them, which is why we can recite them again. However the Rosh (Kesuvos Siman 13) rules that even one who has already heard the brochas can be considered a Ponim Chadoshos if he did not <em>participate in the eating at that time</em> because his presence causes an increased level of joy. It would seem that the Rambam would require a male to be the Panim Chadoshos, because it must be someone who becomes obligated to recite the brochos himself. The Rosh on the other hand, would allow any one who brings additional joy - including a women - to bring the joy and thereby create a new obligation to say the brochos.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (EH 62:8) rules in accordance with the Rosh (that the requirement is because of joy), and it would therefore seem to follow that even a women could be counted. However, the Pischei Teshuva (:14) cites the Zechor Le'avraham that a women can not be considered the Ponim Chadashos.

This is what the verse is saying that “He says\n  to his father and mother that he hasn’t seen him” because he is not\n  required to look after them and surely he doesn’t not have to pay\n  attention to what his brother is doing.Furthermore the verse says He\n  doesn’t know his own children.This is stated in Eiruvin (22a). “What\n  is the meaning of the verse (Shir HaShirim 5:11), “black as a crow.”\n  Rava says it is referring to talmid chachim because of the necessity\n  for him to be cruel to his children as a crow in order to be\n  proficient in his studies. An example is Rav Adda who when he was\n  leaving to study in the beis hamedrash his wife asked him where his\n  children would get food. He responded that there were herbs in the\n  marsh that they could eat.” This that it says in this verse that “he\n  doesn’t know his own children” it also means that his children act as\n  if they don’t know their father. That is because they also are\n  studying Torah and thus don’t know him.</p>\n  \n  <p>Maharal (Tiferes Yisroel #63):  Eiruvin (21b),” (Shir HaShirim 5:11)\n  curled locks black as a crow. Mar Ukva says it teaches that every\n  aspect of Torah should be interpreted to produce many halachic\n  understandings. Rabba says it indicates that Torah mastery depends on\n  deprivation of food which is indicated by the face darkening like a\n  raven. Rava says it means Torah mastery is depends on being cruel to\n  one’s family and wife as a crow.” The underlying concept of expressed\n  in this gemora that the great amount of halachic knowledge which is\n  indicated by curls – they in fact are refined abstract understandings\n  (hasagos hanivdalim) that are separate from this world and are far\n  from the man who is materialistic. That is why the gemora uses the\n  language “with whom do you find these halachos” The first answer is\n  one who devotes his mornings and evenings to understand them. In other\n  words Torah mastery is found in someone who turns his back on the\n  material issues of this world and instead devotes all this time to\n  study these matters. That is because it is impossible that he be a\n  talmid chachom if he is immersed in the material issues of the world.\n  Rabbah provides a higher level in that a real talmid chachom needs to\n  darken himself. That means not only his thoughts are turned from\n  materialism but that he minimizes his physical connection with the\n  materialism of eating and other comforts. In this manner he is fit to\n  acquire these concepts which are separated from a person. The third\n  level described by Rava is to be so separated from this material world\n  that he is cruel to his children. This is a higher level of separation\n  then depriving oneself of material enjoyment such as food. The\n  significance of this is clear that one who is not merciful to his own\n  children has overcome his material nature to a higher degree than one\n  denies himself food. Thus he is more able to acquire these\n  non-physical concepts which are alien to the man immersed in\n  physicality.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Yitzchok Zilberstein (Chashukei Chemed Bava Basra 73b): Question:\n  A father-in-law sees that his son-in-law is a great masmid - however\n  he doesn’t bring any income into the home and his children are going\n  hungry. He is very disturbed by the suffering of his daughter and his\n  grandchildren. He wants to intervene and to request that his\n  son-in-law go to work and provide properly for his family. What can be\n  said to the father-in-law to dissuade him from intervening? Answer: It\n  says in Bava Basra (73b) “Rabbah b. Bar Hana further stated: I saw\n  that frog the size of the Fort of Hagronia. (What is the size of the\n  Fort of Hagronia? — Sixty houses.) There came a snake and swallowed\n  the frog. Then came a raven and swallowed the snake, and perched on a\n  tree. Imagine how strong the tree was. R. Papa b. Samuel said: Had I\n  not been there I would not have believed it.” The Gra explains the\n  significance of the frog according the medrash. Why were the Egyptians\n  afflicted with frogs? Because they prevented the Jews from studying\n  Torah like the frog that didn’t stop day and night. That is the\n  meaning of “that frog” – meaning a great Torah scholar. “The size of\n  Fort of Hagronia which was the size of 60 houses” – alludes to the\n  fact that the scholar reads and learns with his throat (garon) – 60\n  tractates which he has mastered. “Then a snake came” – that is\n  referring to the yetzer harah which is called snake which stays close\n  to the talmid chachom to prevent him from studying Torah because of\n  the lack of food. Then the crow comes and swallows the snake. This is\n  explained in Eiruvin (22a) regarding the verse “black as a crow” –\n  that one who make himself a cruel as crow regarding his children. That\n  is because the yetzer harah tries to seduce the person to stop\n  learning because of the lack of food. However the one who makes\n  himself as cruel as a crow and continues learning Torah day and night\n  – then G‑d Himself provides them with food. That is the significance\n  of the crow sitting on the tree – that G‑d Himself supports the talmid\n  chachom like in a Yissachar Zevulen relationship. “Thus imagine\n  powerful that tree is” – meaning how great is the power of those who\n  support people who study Torah from the fact that Yaakov and Moshe\n  preceded the Berachos of Zevulen to Yissachar. And a certain talmid\n  chachom related that immediately after the war the Brisker Rav met the\n  Mastrikover Rebbe. Both of them had lost many family members. The\n  Brisk Rav said, Our Sages tell us that the verse, “Man when he dies in\n  the tent” teaches us that Torah is only mastered by someone who is\n  willing to kill himself for it. One can also interpret these words to\n  mean that a man is obligated to kill his emotions in order to learn\n  Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But suppose a Jew were to believe that Jesus was the Moshiach, while rejecting the Christian ideas that Jesus was divine, that there was a Trinity, that the Torah (including the oral Torah, Mishnah/Talmud) was to be rejected, or that the New Testament is scripture on par with the Tanach. Would such a person have left Judaism for Christianity similar to what \"Messianic Jews\" have done? </p>\n\n<p>Some Jewish authorities, while rejecting Chabad Messianism, still accept them as Orthodox Jews, on the grounds that other than a peculiar belief about who the Moshiach is, they otherwise adhere to Judaism; could that logic be applied to a person who believed in Jesus as Moshiach without the other beliefs associated with Christianity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You have a mistake in your premise.

Rather, he should be considered as all the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who died. God caused him to arise only to test the many, as Daniel 11:35 states: 'And some of the wise men will stumble, to try them, to refine, and to clarify until the appointed time, because the set time is in the future.'</p>\n<p>Jesus of Nazareth who aspired to be the Mashiach and was executed by the court was also alluded to in Daniel's prophecies, as ibid. 11:14 states: 'The vulgar among your people shall exalt themselves in an attempt to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So clearly the Rambam says the at one time belief that J would be Mashiach was not heretical, but today it is.</p>\n\n\n",

In essence, this is a contractual relationship.  Although a student cannot sell his entire reward for learning in exchange for financial support, mostly because it would be unconscionable to do so, Rabbi Yerucham, and others, say that a Torah scholar can give a share of his reward to his sponsor.  Rabbeinu Yerucham Ne/hil' 2 to end.  But if he does so, what he gives away is subtracted from what he earned, says Rabbi Joseph Karo, author of the Shulchan Aruch.  Responsa Avkath Rokhel 2. (\"[The one who studies all day] may give half his reward for Torah study to another... and it is then as if he studied Torah for half a day\"); accord ShaKb, SA Yoreh De'ah 246, note 2. </p>\n\n<p>According to various midrashim the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar had this sort of contract -- Zebulun worked in business and supported the tribe of Issachar who were purely devoted to learning. E.g. Midrash Rabba Genesis 99:9. The midrashim cite this contactual relationship as an explanation as to why the Torah lists Zebulun ahead of Issachar despite the fact that Issachar is older -- Zebulun advances based upon his support of Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>Nowhere in the Talmud is the Zebulun-Issachar contract recognized one way or another as a good or bad idea.  If anything, the Tannaim would appear to have been against the concept of full-time, subsidized scholarships for Torah students.  Mishna Avos 2:2 says: \"Any Torah not associated with labor will end in failure and cause sin.\"</p>\n\n<p>The sages clear preference is that all Jews should study Torah and not trying to get credit for other people's learning by simply giving them money to learn.  But, the rabbis also understood that for some people, sitting down and learning every day is not an option.  We see this in a discussion by the rabbis of the last curse of the Tochecha -- the list of curses given to the Jewish people as a warning should they forget to observe the Torah --  which says: \"Cursed be he who will not uphold the words of this Torah in order to fulfill them.\"  Deuteronomy 27:26. What did the Torah mean by \"uphold the words of this Torah\"? The Yerushalmi Talmud concludes that: \"[Even] if one learned, taught, observed and fulfilled, but had the opportunity to strengthen [the observance of\nothers] and did not strengthen it, he is included in the curse.\"  JT Sotah 7:4. Accordingly, in their view, it was not enough to study Torah, you had to help others to do so as well.  Another view notes that there is no explicit order in the verse to imply that \"upholding Torah\" means that one MUST study Torah, Rabbenu Yonah says that means \"[o]ne should observe the actions of his fellow workers [in the service of God]\" and encourage them by giving financial support.  Sha'arey Teshuvah 3: 19.</p>\n\n<p>I think one of the most immediate rewards is obtaining <i>nachas</i> from the learning of someone you supported.  On this topic, one of the most meaningful stories is the story of Rabbi Akiva and his wife Rachel.  Rachel gave up her relationship with her father (and possibly an inheritance -- that is less clear) and worked for 24 years while her husband lived away from home and studied Torah.  The Gemara at Nedarim 50a tells the story of Akiva's triumphal return home with his 24,000 students.  Rachel tries to get up close to welcome her husband home.  But because she is wearing rags and has nothing better, the students ridicule her, asking how she could come dressed like that to see a great sage.  Akiva tells his students, \"all that I have [i.e. his Torah learning] and all that you have is from her.\"  Whether or not any of his learning merited her a place in the world to come, the measure of nachas she must have felt, I think, made her sacrifices worthwhile to her.</p>\n\n\n",

Avraham was 137 when Sarah died.  Earlier (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0117.htm#17\" rel=\"noreferrer\">17:17</a>), Avraham had laughed at the idea of having children at the age of 100, yet neither the text nor Rashi makes any comment about these later children.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an interpretation that has this happening earlier, during Sarah's lifetime?  If so, details please?</p>\n\n<p>If the plain reading is correct, then was it unusual for a man of 137+ to sire children?  If it was unusual, does anybody comment on it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>As far as I know, there are three approaches to this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This was a natural occurrence. This is the opinion of Ramban, as is explained in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22210/the-miracle-of-hagars-giving-birth/22229#22229\">this answer</a>. This approach is also taken by R' David Tzvi Hoffman, who adds that given Avraham's lifespan at 175, his age at the time of marrying Keturah (about 140) is comparable to the age of 56 for someone of a more contemporary average lifespan (70-year). The only miracle in Yitzchak's birth is the fact that Sarah was previously barren, not having had a child in 90 years. [See <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/hofman/hof_br25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (p.383) and <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/hofman/hof_br17.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (p. 262).]</li>\n<li>This was a miraculous occurrence. This seems to be the approach of Abarbanel, who is bewildered at what possessed Avraham to do something like this. He discusses six reasons why God wanted Avraham to have more children at this late point in his life. (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40213&st=&pgnum=115\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)</li>\n<li>This happened way earlier in Avraham's life, certainly long before Sarah's death. This is the opinion of Shadal. (See <a href=\"http://www.tora.us.fm/tnk1/jdl/MefarsheyTanach001-25.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> addresses this in his commentary to Genesis 17:17 which you mentioned. There we find that Abraham laughed at the fact that he would have a child when he would be 100 years old and Sarah would be 90 years old. Ralbag there asserts that Abraham was only making a big deal out of the fact that Sarah would be 90 years old, but not that he would be 100 years old, and then tells us why he gives this explanation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולם בארנו זה הפסוק באופן הזה לפי שכבר מצאנו באברהם שהיה בן קל\"ז שנה\n  כשמתה שרה ולקח אשה אחר זה והוליד ממנה ואין ספק שאילו לא היה ראוי אברהם\n  להוליד לא היה נושא אשה כי חלילה לו שישאנה להנאת המשגל ואיננו זר גם\n  בזמננו זה שיולד לבן מאה שנה וכל שכן שלא היה זה זר בחק אברהם שהיה ארוך\n  החיים ממנו וכבר הבינו זה בזה האופן בב\"ר</p>\n  \n  <p>However, we have explained this verse in this fashion because we\n  already find that Abraham was 137 years old when Sarah died, and he\n  took a wife after this and had children through her. And there is no\n  doubt that if Abraham had not been able to have children he would not\n  have married, for heaven forfend that he would marry for sexual\n  pleasure. And even in our times it is not outlandish for someone to\n  father children at the age of 100; and certainly not with Abraham's\n  constitution, as he was more long-lived than us. And this has already\n  been understood in this fashion in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_Rabbah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis Rabbah</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, from the fact that Abraham was willing to marry at the age of 137, Ralbag derives that Abraham must have thought it quite possible for him to have kids at that age. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, to answer your question, according to Ralbag's explanation Abraham's children from Keturah did indeed come at the age of 137, this was not tremendously out of the ordinary, and Abraham had not in fact laughed at his ability to have children at the age of 100.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is each part of birkat Kohanim a full blessing?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm confused as to whether or not birkat kohanim is a true \"blessing\" in the halachic sense. Part of my confusion arises from how we respond when it is said. In many ashkenazic minyanim outside of Israel, during the week it is recited by the chazzan and the congregation responds \"keyn yehi ratzon - so should be his will\" after each verse. I have seen some sefardic minyanim where they respond \"baruch hu u'varuch shemo\" after each mention of God's name as well. However during Yom Tov the Kohanim recite it and the congregation responds Amen to each verse. At still other times, such as blessing the children on Shabbat all three verses are recited with no responses in between, and possibly not even an 'amen' afterwards at all. </p>\n\n<p>So my question is, what exactly do we mean when we say that birkat kohanim is a 'bracha'? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Each of the 3 Pesukim in Birkat Cohanim consists of 2 Brachot.

He says \"<em>Bless us with the threefold Bracha written in the Torah; Yevarechecha, etc.</em>\", so we answer \"may it be [His] will\"; we can't answer Amen since there was no direct \"wish\". </p>\n\n<p>As opposed to the Cohanim who are actually blessing us, so we answer \"Amen\".</p>\n\n<p>Responding:  <code>baruch hu u'varuch shemo</code> is frowned upon by many Poskim - when the Cohanim are blessing us - since it's a Hefsek. Other Poskim seem to allow it, judging by common practice.</p>\n\n<p>When <code>blessing the children on Shabbat</code> they usually don't answer Amen either out of habit, since they havbe been blessed this way since before they could talk, or else because it's often said quietly. Lately my kids have started saying Amen when they figure out I'm done (by lifting my hands off their head); I have no idea what prompted that behavior.</p>\n\n\n",

My question is whether the sources who advocate metzitzah b'peh with direct oral contact for infants also require it when an adult Jewish male is seeking circumcision (as many Russian immigrants needed to), or in the case of adult male converts. Also, if the man was already circumcised and requires only hatafas dam bris (a ceremonial drawing of some blood), would metzitzah b'peh with direct oral contact be necessary?</p>\n\n<p>I ask these questions because when I converted I did not have MBP, and I have not heard of any other converts having gone through that.  However, I and most converts I know only had a hatafas dam bris.  Moreover, in either case blood could be drawn out of an adult penis more easily, it would seem to me, through squeezing the tissue, whereas an infant's penis may simply be too small to do that without causing injury.

They had made exactly the right amount in order to take challah with a bracha. The part that fell onto the floor they now no longer want to use as part of the dough. Therefore the mixture is now missing a proper \"shiur\" (amount) in order to take challah with a bracha. Can a bracha still be made when challah is taken from the dough in such a case?</p>\n\n<p>To begin with one could ask, when does the dough become chiyuv in general in taking off challah? Does it help in this case that the piece of dough is still around and can be put together with the entire mixture, then separate the challah with a bracha, even though the person will not use this piece and throw it away.

This is no worse than when one forgets to separate Challah before Shabbos (in the diaspora) he may eat from the bread and leave over some bread and separates Challah after Shabbos with a Beracha even though at the time of separation he has less than the amount of dough/bread that requires Challah to be taken.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel one may not eat any of the bread before Separating Challah.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Schachter cites Rema (Yoreh De'ah, end of siman 245) and Gra (Yoreh De'ah 245:38) that being the rabbi of a city is a position of <em>serarah</em>. This would mean that it would not be permitted for a convert. In the words of Rabbi Schachter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on the interpretation of the Torah <em>she’Be’al Peh</em>, the <em>pesukim</em>\ntell us that we may not appoint a <em>ger</em> to serve as King or in any\ncapacity of <em>serarah</em>, as, for example, to serve as a rabbi of a\ncommunity, or (as mentioned by the Talmud) as president of a labor\nunion. A <em>ger</em> may not serve as a <em>dayan</em> in a <em>din Torah</em> involving a\nYisrael, but may serve as a <em>dayan</em> in a <em>din Torah</em> involving other\n<em>geirim</em>. Obviously it is possible to confer <em>semichah</em> on a <em>ger</em>,\notherwise he would not even be able to serve as a <em>dayan</em> for a case\ninvolving other <em>geirim</em>. Although a <em>ger</em> may not serve as a rabbi in a\nkehillah of Yisraelim, we still allow <em>geirim</em> to join the <em>semichah</em>\nprogram in the Yeshiva and to receive <em>semichah</em> upon successful\ncompletion of their studies, because years ago real <em>semichah</em> was\nsometimes conferred on <em>geirim</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Moshe Feinstein does not address this exact question. Nevertheless, in addressing a similar question about whether a convert can become a Rosh Yeshiva, he expresses a lenient inclination. Here is a free translation of what R. Moshe Feinstein says  (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14679&pgnum=257\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iggeros Moshe YD 4:26</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The simple answer, based on the Gemara in Kiddushin 76b... and Yevamot\n45b... and the Rambam Hil. Melachim 1:4... is that it is forbidden to\nappoint a convert for a position of authority for Jews...

It's important to note that these reasons aren't all mutually exclusive; a person may suffer for multiple reasons on this list simultaneously. However, the first item on the list is nearly always applicable.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spiritual \"vomit\":</strong> The same way that when one ingests a poison, he throws up in order to purge it from his system, suffering is intended as a way to purge the spiritual poison of sin from one's body.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gilgulim:</strong> Sometimes, particularly regarding children (i.e. under 20) who suffer, suffering is brought not because of what they have done in <em>this</em> lifetime, but what has happened to them in <em>previous</em> lifetimes.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Alarm clock:</strong> The same way that some people are in such a deep sleep that they require a very rude awakening to wake up, suffering may be disproportionate to the sin in order to wake the person up and inspire them to repent.</li>\n<li><strong>Character building:</strong> Suffering sometimes helps a person develop character traits he didn't know he had. This is what Chazal refer to as \"suffering of love.\" Often this is specifically to imbue one with the middos of Emunah and Bitachon, of trusting that Hashem knows what's best for a person, even if we do not understand it ourselves.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Showing who's in control:</strong> If a person is so arrogant as to believe he has 100% total control over his life, Hashem may give him suffering to wake him up to the fact that Hashem is the one in total control. \"All are in the hands of Heaven except for fear of Heaven.\" The <em>only</em> thing in one's power is how he acts or reacts.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Inspiration for others:</strong> A person may suffer not to help himself, but to help others. When others see how he suffers yet maintains pure Emunah, that serves as a paradigm for others from which they can learn and which they can model.</li>\n<li><strong>Sharing the burden:</strong> The truly righteous of the generation may suffer for no fault of their own, but rather to take the suffering that their generation deserves but is unable to bear. As we are all connected, the truly righteous are able to bear the burden for us, and through their suffering, we are able to be healed.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Mechanisms:</strong> Sometimes, suffering just happens because of our actions. A person eats a fatty diet over a long enough period of time and wakes up twenty years later with clogged arteries (actually, he should be thankful that he woke up). The question here shouldn't be \"Why did You do this to me?\" but rather \"Why did You not perform a miracle to save me?\" Hashem doesn't intervene in such cases unless one is exceptionally worthy. Otherwise, suffering may be due to our own stupid decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Hanhagas HaMazal:</strong> If man is given free choice, isn't it possible that the world will never reach its perfection, as man can continuously mess up? Sometimes, Hashem will subtly intervene, in what's called <em>Hanhagas HaMazal.</em> Sometimes, as a result of this, people suffer. Nevertheless, they will benefit as a result, whether as one of the above or purely as reward for their participation in helping the world forward. There are two types of suffering that fall under this umbrella, which I'll term \"active\" and \"passive.\"\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Active Hanhagah:</strong> In this version, a person needs to be developed in order to aid the world. In order to do so, he must suffer, to, for instance, build character (or something else listed above). However, this suffering is always attributable to some sin, though completely out of proportion to it. The book gives the example of Rebbi Yehudah HaNasi, who was punished with a severe toothache for the insensitivity expressed in his shooing away a lamb being taken to the slaughter, saying, \"Go; for this you were created.\" The suffering was meant to develop Rebbi into the leader he would become, but there still needed to be <em>some</em> basis for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Passive Hanhagah:</strong> Rabbi Kirzner's analogy is a son who comes to his parents with a request for a motorcycle. Concerned for his physical safety, as well as the potential spiritual damage due to hanging around negative influences, the parents refuse. The son continues pleading, offering to get the safest helmet on the market, going on a hunger strike, and eventually threatening suicide if he doesn't get his bike. What should the parents do now? He's made the bike so much a part of him that he cannot live without it. So they allow him to get the bike and hope that they've provided the proper upbringing that one day he will realize his mistake and give up his bike.<br>\nSo, too, Hashem will sometimes let mankind run the world, without His intervention. Man will build a world in his image, based on his greed and arrogance. Eventually, it <em>will</em> collapse. \"Your dream will reveal itself to be a nightmare. The bigger and stronger you build that world, the more powerfully you will experience the nightmare. Only then will you utterly reject this idol, with every aspect of your being.\" As a result of this world, many will suffer, not due to any fault of their own, but because Hashem has removed His influence and let nature run its own course.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mosaf Rashi to Berachot 5A</a> points to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=13b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's commentary on Eruvin 13B</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יפשפש מעשיו. שעשה כבר ויבדוק עבירות שבידו ויתודה וישוב:‏</p>\n<p><strong>He should check his deeds</strong> that he has already committed, examine the transgressions found in his hands, confess, and return (i.e. do Teshuvah)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would seem to indicate that the suffering is a wake up call.

    "content": "# The torah sometimes uses \"olah tamid\" and sometimes \"olat tamid\" but they seem to mean the same thing; what's the difference?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know that in Biblical Hebrew (and presumably other varieties), we see the construct \"noun adjective\", with the noun unodified, such as \"parah adamah\" (red heifer).  We also see the noun-chain construct, \"noun noun\", which usually means \"noun (of) noun\", and in that case the first noun is modified: \"eish*<em>et</em>* chayil\" (woman of valor), \"birk*<em>at</em>* kohanim\" (priestly blessing, but literally blessing of priests).</p>\n\n<p>During yesterday's torah reading (Rosh Chodesh) I noticed both <em>olah tamid</em> and <em>olat tamid</em>, but I don't see why the grammar would be different between the uses.  The former is what I'm used to seeing, for example in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0428.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 28:3</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאָמַרְתָּ לָהֶם--זֶה הָאִשֶּׁה, אֲשֶׁר תַּקְרִיבוּ לַיהוָה:  כְּבָשִׂים בְּנֵי-שָׁנָה תְמִימִם שְׁנַיִם לַיּוֹם, <strong>עֹלָה תָמִיד</strong>.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But a little later we see (in 28:6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>עֹלַת, תָּמִיד</strong>--הָעֲשֻׂיָה, בְּהַר סִינַי, לְרֵיחַ נִיחֹחַ, אִשֶּׁה לַיהוָה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I see the comma there (which was not in the siddur I was following along in yesterday).  Punctuation, of course, is editorial.  In both cases the text <em>seems</em> to be describing a continual <em>olah</em> (burnt-offering).  And later, in 28:10, we see another <em>olat</em> formation without any complicating punctuation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>עֹלַת שַׁבַּת</strong>, בְּשַׁבַּתּוֹ, עַל-עֹלַת הַתָּמִיד, וְנִסְכָּהּ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What distinguishes the cases that use the <em>olah</em> formation from the ones that use the <em>olat</em> formation?  They all look the same to me, semantically; does the syntactic difference mean something?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>We call this offering the תמיד offering (noun), but it seems to me that the first posuk (28,3) is telling how it got this name - because it is an עלה תמיד - an everlasting (adverb) offering. Only subsequently it is called the תמיד (noun), and thus it is now logical to refer to the עולה as the עלת תמיד - the olah of the (well known) tamid.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken, the עלת form is the סמיכות form, the possesive, as if it were \"עלה של\", \"the olah of\". עלה itself is just the noun. As for the <em>trop</em>, there are times, לתפארת הקריאה that the בעלי מסורה put a מפסיק in even if not logically called for. The first half of that <em>pasuk</em> is two words, and often an <em>esnachta</em> demands its <em>tipcha</em> even if logically the two should be connected. That is why there is that comma in Mechon Mamre, because of the <em>tipcha</em> even though the two words should be considered one phrase.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>@msh210 Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs but not nouns.   עֹלָ֥ה (Num 28:3) is a noun and therefore תָמִֽיד cannot be modifying עֹלָ֥ה.  Perhaps if it were an adverb it would be modifying the verb תַּקְרִ֖יבוּ (describing how the action of offering it is to be performed).</p>\n<p>If it were an adjective modifying the feminine noun עֹלָ֥ה it should be declined as a feminine adjective to match the feminine noun (עולה תמידה).</p>\n<p>See the commentary on this verse called Parshegen by Rabbi Dr. Rafael Posen who explains Onkelos' translation and brings an explanation from the work Minchat Yehuda by the Riva.  Onkelos does not view it as a case of smichut but rather a noun phrase (\"tadira\"; as a תואר (adjective) of alata (the noun עֹלָ֥ה in absolute state).</p>\n<p>עֹלָה תמיד אינה סמיכות</p>\n<p>ב. ›״עֹלָה תָמִיד״ – ״עֲלָתָא תְּדִירָא״. בפסוקנו ״עֹלָה תָמִיד״, ואינה בסמיכות – ״עֹלַת תָּמִיד״ כבפסוקים המקבילים (פס׳ ו), וכתב ע״כ ריב״א:</p>\n<p><strong>מילה זו באה על דרך זה שהיה לו לכתוב עולת תמיד שהרי הוא דבוק כי בהרבה מקומות תי״ו בא במקום ה״א בדבקות, ואין לומר שאינו דבוק ופתרונו עולה שהיא תמיד בכל יום דאם כן היה לו לכתוב עולה תמידה שהרי עולה לשון נקבה וראיה לדבר עולת תמיד עשויה בהר סיני.⁠\nעד״י ב״א.⁠</strong></p>\n<p>אונקלוס כאמור אינו סובר שמדובר בסמיכות שכן תרגם ״עֲלָתָא תְּדִירָא״ – כיון שאינו נסמך אלא ״עולה״ בנפרד, ו״תמיד״ – תואר, אבל ״עֹלַת תָּמִיד״ בנסמך – ״עֲלַת תְּדִירָא״ וכן ״זֹאת עֹלַת חֹדֶשׁ בְּחָדְשׁוֹ״ (פס׳ יד) ״דָּא עֲלַת רֵישׁ יַרְחָא בְּאִתְחַדָּתוּתֵיהּ״, ועיין לקמן פס׳ ו.</p>\n<p>I think it is pretty clear that עֹלַ֥ת הַתָּמִ֖יד (Num 28:10) is a case of smichut with הַתָּמִ֖יד functioning as a noun.</p>\n\n\n",

He does not distinguish between Written and Oral Torah. </li>\n<li>The Maharal in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42865&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction to Tiferes Yisrael</a> explains that the brachah on learning Torah is \"la'asok be-divrei Torah\" because the mitzvah is the effort of trying to understand, and even if you come out with an incorrect p'shat, you have still fulfilled the mitzvah. But the Maharal agrees that the mitzvah is to attempt to understand what the Torah is saying, not just reading the words. </li>\n<li>The Shulchan Aruch ha-Rav (Hil. Talmud Torah 2:12) is the source for the idea that there is a difference between Torah shebe'al peh and Torah shebiksav, and that for Torah shebiksav, there is a mitzvah even if one doesn't understand what one is reading. Many later discussions begin with the Shulchan Aruch ha-Rav as a starting point. See e.g., R. Yaakov Kamenetzky's introduction to Emes le-Yaakov al ha-Torah. However, there are a number of sources which dispute the Shulchan Aruch ha-Rav altogether. See, e.g., fn. 10 <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47103&st=&pgnum=607\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>The aforementioned footnote also contains Rishonim which support the Shulchan Aruch ha-Rav's contention. </li>\n<li>Finally, there are kabbalistic sources which support the idea that even reading Torah shebe'al peh without understanding is a mitzvah, although I cannot find them right now. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

If someone was eating (by themselves, see Sif Beis for why I'm mentioning this) vegetables and left the place where they were eating and went outside and then came back they would have to make a new bracha on what they are eating from before.

If they go in and come out however they make a new bracha <em>unless</em> they had in mind to come back which in that case a new bracha is not made (the M\"B in note 6 adds this is only if they had in mind to return immediately.) It seems to be however that by eating even if someone has in mind to return and continue eating in the original place if they walked outside and came back a new bracha would be made. This is not the case of besamim where if one had in mind to come back they wouldn't make a new bracha even after leaving this place. What is the difference between eating and besamim?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it forbidden to wear a snap-brim Borsalino fedora on Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud, at <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=138b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 138b</a>, presents the opinion that one may not wear a <i>siyana</i> -- which Rashi defines as a wide-brimmed hat — on Shabbos if it has a brim that is one tefach (hand-bredth) wide because it is like erecting an <i>ohel</i> (tent).  Tosafos cites Rabbi Chananel for the principle that this is only where the brim is stiff, and Rashi adds that we are concerned that the wind will pick the hat up and blow it off, causing one to pick it up in violation of the issur to carry in a public domain.  So Rashi would hold that it is only prohibited if the hat does not fit tightly on one's head.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question comes up — the black snap-brim Borsalino fedora has now become a staple for men in the Yeshivish world.  The brim on most hats is easily a tefach wide, and the snap-brim makes the brim tight enough to become an air-foil.  On what basis can we claim that this type of hat is not a <i>siyana</i> and therefore forbidden to wear on Shabbos?  Could this be a concern for other types of felt hats common in the Haredi world (the names of these hats are unfamiliar to me)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>There are two distinct issues to deal with in this question:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The question of <em>ohel</em> due to the size of the hat brim.</li>\n<li>The question of wearing a hat that can be blown off and thus lead to possible carrying.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is important to bear in mind that in both issues we are dealing with a <em>d'rabbanan</em> issue, which leaves us open to be more lenient than if we were dealing with an outright <em>melacha d'Oraisa</em>. (A hat is not considered a genuine <em>ohel d'Oraisa</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=167\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MB 301:152</a>).)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brim Length and <em>Ohel</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>With regard to the question of <em>ohel</em>, the first issue to deal with is the length of a <em>tefach</em>. According to the handy little chart in the back of R' Aryeh Carmell's סייעתא לגמרא, R' Moshe Feinstein holds a tefach to be 3.5 inches. (The Chazon Ish holds about 10% longer, and R' A. C. Noeh holds about 10% shorter.) (Moreover, if I understand the halacha correctly, the issue is not the actual length of the brim but how far it extends from the head. Thus, a curved brim will be significantly shorter than a straight brim.)</p>\n\n<p>While it is perfectly possible to get <em>yeshivish</em> black hats that have brims that are well below the length of a <em>tefach</em>, hat brims that are more than a <em>tefach</em> are apparently <a href=\"http://www.hatboxmenswear.com/system/scripts/results_big.cgi?product=2003&category=341\" rel=\"noreferrer\">quite common and popular in the frum world</a>. This therefore does raise a serious question.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=167\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Mishneh Berura</em> (301:152)</a> discusses the question of hats of this sort that were commonly worn on Shabbos, and cites a variety of different justifications for the leniency. Although not all of these explanations would apply to modern fedoras, the most basic answer is that people rely on the opinion of Rashi that there is no prohibition of <em>ohel</em> with regard to hats in the first place. Thus, the MB concludes that in a place where people are generally lenient on this issue, we should not protest (אין למחות), however in a place where they are not accustomed to being lenient, it is certainly proper to be stringent.</p>\n\n<p>So, with regard to <em>ohel</em> it would seem that there are certainly valid reasons to be lenient, but it would be best to just buy a hat with a 3 inch (or smaller) brim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Hat that Can Be Blown Off</strong></p>\n\n<p>The issue here is that the rabbis enacted a decree prohibiting wearing a hat that can be blown off in the wind because if that happens we are concerned that the person will pick it up and carry it for four <em>amos</em>. In his discussion of this issue <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=168\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(301:41)</a>, the <em>Mishneh Berura</em> explains that this issue only applies to hats that are worn on top of smaller hats. The reason for this is that a religious Jew will not walk in public with a bare head, so there is no risk that he will inadvertently carry his hat for four <em>amos</em> after he picks it up if that is the only hat he is wearing.</p>\n\n<p>This, of course, raises the question about our current practice of wearing hats on top of a <em>yarmulka</em>. If our hats qualify as hats that can blow off in the wind (and, in my opinion, they clearly do), then one should certainly avoid walking in a <em>reshus harabbim</em> with a <em>yarmulka</em> under the hat as the MB rules. (This happens to be my personal practice. When I was a student in the Mirrer Yeshiva in Brooklyn, I observed that when R' Shmuel Birnbaum <em>zatzal</em> arrived for <em>shacharis</em> on Shabbos morning, he would walk to his seat with his hat on, take a <em>yarmulka</em> out of his <em>tallis</em> bag, remove his hat, and put on the <em>yarmulke</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Those who are lenient presumably maintain that, as a general rule, our hats are sufficiently firmly attached to our heads that they are unlikely to blow off from a normal wind. Of course, this would vary from case to case, so it is difficult to give an absolute rule.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, it would seem that this prohibition would only apply in a <em>reshus harabbim d'Oraisa</em>, which is fairly uncommon except in densely populated metropolitan areas like Brooklyn, NY.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is not a concern , halacha is talking about a hat that serves a protection either from the sun or rain,but for stylish hats there is no problem.\nsee the Shulchan Aruch 301:40-41 Mishna Brurah 151-153.</p>\n\n\n",

Translation:</p>\n\n<p>(Until specified, this mishna is about violations of sanctity, as in eating קדשים  and going into the בית המקדש, while טמא.)

If there was knowledge at the end but not the beginning, the שעיר הנעשה בפנים and the day of יום כיפור atone. R' Meir says, all שעירים are specifically for [violations of prohibitions] of טומאת מקדש וקדשיו. R' Shimon says, the שעיר of יו''כ is for knowledge at the end but not the beginning. R' Shimon ben Yehuda says, that of יו''כ atones for someone who is טהור who ate something [קדוש] that is טמא, as well as on on someone who had no knowledge at all, and on one who had knowledge at the end but not the beginning. All other sins in the תורה, severe or not, intentional or not, known or not, positive or negative, excommunication and capital crimes, the \"scapegoat\" atones, for Israelites, priests, and the high priest, except that the bull atones for the priests who transgressed the purity of the קודש and the קדשים. R' Shimon says, just as the blood of the  הנעשה בפנים שעיר atones for Israelites, so to the blood of the bull atones for the priests. Just as the confession on the \"scapegoat\" atones for Israelite, so to the confession on the bull atones for priests.</p>\n\n<p>Fot a more elucidated explanation, see the מפרשי המשניות on the first mishna of Shavuot, or this link: <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/rst/nezikin/37a%20-%20Shevuos%20-%202a-28b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soncino in English, PDF</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Rus from Moav and Naamah from Ammon. Rus is well known, the only information I could find on Naamah is from Kings 14:21 where she is mentioned as the mother of Rechavam. The classical commentaries on that verse (including: Metzudos Dovid, Radak, Ralbag, Malbim) indicate that she was a bad influence on her son teaching him to worship idols in Shlomo's old age. Now it is possible that she was a huge tzaddakis before hand and then 'went off the derech' but there is no indication in the pesukim as such.</p>\n\n<p>Which begs the question, what was so good about Naamah the Ammonite?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rabbi Menachem Azariya miPano in Asara Ma'amaros, Eim Kol Chai, section 3 simanim 9-10 cites an unsourced midrash that Shlomo met Naamah when he was cast out of his kingdom by the demon king <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmodeus\">Ashmedia</a> (see gittin 68b). The story goes that Ashmedai cast Shlomo's ring, which had the name of God engraved in it, into the ocean. Shlomo the wanderer ended up in the palace of the king of Ammon, where he served as a guard. Naamah chose to marry him but was expelled from the kingdom for doing so (along with her husband). There near the ocean they encountered a fish which had swallowed Shlomo's ring. Naamah finds the ring inside the fish and gives it to Shlomo, restoring him. </p>\n\n<p>This midrash is cited (in abridged version) by Chidah in midbar kadeimot, ma'arechet nun, section 24. The summation being that what was good about Naamah is that she helped Shlomo \"get back on his feet\" so to speak, though that is never spelled out explicitly. However this aggadah is taken to task by Rabbi Yosef Chaim of Bagdad in his sefer Binayahu on Bava Kamma 38b where he proves (conclusively to my ears) that the story is implausible due to the dates of Shlomo's reign and Rechavam's birth. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, to me this \"midrash\" seems to be a cobbling together of several other well known tropes such as the animal which swallows a treasure which ends up restoring the protagonist or the story of Rebbi Akiva's marriage to the daughter of Kalba Savua. </p>\n\n<p>The gur aryeh to bamidbar 31:2 sees the references to the people themselves, Rus and Naamah, as lav dafka, preferring instead to view the historical themes of the nations of Moav and Ammon leading to the melucha of Dovid and Moshiach</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See Alshich on Rus perek 3 that indicates that from both of them together come the dynasty of Malchus Beis Dovid all the way to Moshiach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism permit sexual relationships outside of marriage?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am eager to know more about different religions from Islam to Judaism. Furthermore, how different religions look at women and comparing their kinds of approaches to the matter of gender and sexuality is one of my favorite topics of research. For the beginning I would like to know what is the idea of Judaism about out of marriage relationship between men and women. I do not mean prostitution and dealing intercourse and money! But having sexual relationship with opposite sex according to the personal choices out of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Please if you are going to use jargon in your answer, add the equal terms in English too. I am not familiar with Judaism's terminology but surely I would understand them if they would be in English. At least I can search them in the internet to understand.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Basically, it's prohibited.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.18?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 23:18</a> states \"there shall not be a prostitute among the sons or daughters of Israel\"; so clearly there is a prohibition on prostitution. (For Jews. Jews expect non-Jews to follow some basics of ethical monotheism, known as the Seven Noahide Laws; this means we expect non-Jews to not commit adultery, however prostitution per se is not prohibited for them.) This is a standard-severity \"don't do\" prohibition, for which the theoretical maximum punishment (which hasn't been administered for a long, long time) would be 39 lashes. (As opposed to something severe such as adultery, which theoretically could have incurred the death penalty thousands of years ago.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=4&hilchos=25&perek=2&halocha=17&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides' interpretation</a> is that this prohibits any sexual relations outside of marriage. Other medieval rabbis read the Bible's prohibition as being only on prostitution (open to anyone); according to them, sex outside of marriage was prohibited later, by the rabbis (probably sometime between the year 200 BCE and 200 CE).</p>\n\n<p>Clearly there were Jewish kings in the Bible who had \"concubines\", which appears to be some sort of relationship that's not full-fledged marriage. There's a lot of discussion as to what exactly a \"concubine\" means, and whether this was an option only for kings (or chieftains or the like). As the whole \"concubine\" thing is far from clear, standard Orthodox Judaism today takes it for granted that sexual relations are intended only within the bounds of marriage.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>B'h</p>\n\n<p>Judaism has thrived on retaining what is holy under difficult and seemingly impossible situations. \nJudaism views unlike christianity and others sexuality as special, precious and holy only when it includes G-d in the picture but when it becomes nothing more then animalistic and materialistic then it can degrade oneself and humanity. \nJudaism within a marriage preserves the holy outside  of it, it is only conducive to worshipping of oneself. As far as maid servants and concubines in Torah law they were to be treated with dignity and respect not just to use and abuse. Sexuality outside of a marriage serves no purpose other then the worship of the physical and the impact in can make on ones hashkafa with regards to women.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Playing with a pet on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there any opinion that holds one may play or touch a pet on Shabbos (even though animals are normally muktzeh on Shabbos.) Specifically one that is meant for this purpose (to play with.) I heard recently that the Maharach Or Zaruah mentions such a thing. Is there any such opinion found?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I had thought the answer was \"absolutely yes\" (i.e., you cannot pet even your own dog on Shabbos), but I checked two of my Shabbos seforim and the Internet and found a bit of nuance.</p>\n\n<p>Volume 2, Part V of <em>The Concise Code of Jewish Law: Compiled from the Kitzur Shulhan Aruch and Traditional Sources</em> by Rabbi Gersion Appel says this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"All animals including pets are muktzeh. Hence it is not permitted to\n  handle and fondle dogs, cats, and other animals on the Sabbath. It is,\n  however, permitted to give them food, as indeed it is one's duty to\n  feed his animals. [...] If the animal is in distress, or it is\n  necessary to prevent its suffering, one may hold it by the neck and\n  lead it\" (333).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Volume 1 of <em>A Semicha Aid for Learning the Laws of Shabbos: An English Translation and Compilation of the Laws of Shabbos from the Alter Rebbe's Shulchan Aruch, in Accordance to Topic</em> by Rabbi Yaakov Goldstein reiterates that animals, including domestic animals, are muktzeh and cannot be moved on Shabbos; however, in a private domain they can be moved by their neck, their sides, and their legs (without lifting them off the ground) if \"the animals need this to be done\"; i.e., to prevent suffering (331). In a public domain or a karmalis, one may only push the animal[s] from behind, so as not to come close to carrying. (Interestingly, this source suggests that the specific prohibition of carrying does not apply to non-domestic animals--although they may still be muktzeh, and certainly my first source suggests they are.)</p>\n\n<p>On p. 332, my second source responds thus to the specific question \"May one pet his dog?\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Seemingly this may not be done as one moves its hairs by doing so,\n  and moving even part of an animal is forbidden unless done to prevent\n  the animal pain. Perhaps however one can claim that hair is not\n  considered a real substance as is a limb. Vetzrauch Iyun.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found another lenient discussion <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/halacha/jachter_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A. Are Pets Muktza? The Talmud (Shabbat 128b) states that animals are\n  muktza. The reason for this, explains Magid Mishnah41 (commentary to\n  Rambam Hilchot Shabbat 25:25), is that animal have no utility on\n  Shabbat and Yom Tov. Hence, they are comparable in this regard to\n  sticks and stones which are classified as \"muktza machamt gufa\",\n  muktza by its very nature (i.e., because they have no utility on\n  Shabbat and Yom Tov). The Rishonim, however, debate whether an animal\n  which can be used to quiet a child from crying is considered to be\n  muktza. Tosafot (Shabbat 45b s.v. hacha), Mordechai (Shabbat 316) and\n  Hagahot Oshri (commenting on Rosh, Shabbat 3:21) cite authorities who\n  believe that such animals are not muktza by virtue of the fact that\n  they have utility. Yet Tosafot, Mordechai, Hagahot Oshri, and Rosh\n  (cited in the responsa of Maharach Or Zarua, 82) reject these\n  authorities because of two possible considerations. First, the fact\n  that an animal can be used to quiet a child from crying is\n  insufficient utility to render the creature no longer to be considered\n  muktza machmat gufa. Second, the rabbis classified all animals as\n  muktza regardless of whether a particular animal has utility on\n  Shabbat and Yom Tov. This is an example of \"lo plug rabbanan\",\n  rabbinic legislation which was instituted for a reason, yet embraces\n  even the cases for which the reason does not apply Shulchan Aruch\n  (308:39) appears to accept the position that all animals are\n  considered to be muktza since Rabbi Karo states that animals are\n  muktza without exception. Indeed, Shulchan Aruch Harav (308:78) rules\n  stringently in this regard.43</p>\n  \n  <p>The question arises, though, whether circumstances have changed since\n  the time of the Rishonim. These authorities discuss animals which can\n  possibly be used to amuse children but not animals whose entire\n  purpose is to entertain and provide companionship to their owners.\n  Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited in Shmirat Shabat Kehilchata 27,\n  footnote 96), in fact, raises the possibility of making this\n  distinction, yet he rules that pets are muktza. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein\n  (Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chaim 4:16 and cited in \"the halachos of Muktza\"\n  p. 7 of the Hebrew section, paragraph twenty-four) and Rabbi Ovadia\n  Yosef (Yabia Omer, 5:26) also reject the possibility of making such a\n  distinction. It appears that this question is contingent on one's\n  acceptance of one of the two reasons (stated above) offered by the\n  Rishonim) for why an animal that can be used to quiet a child from\n  crying is muktza. If one adopts the position that the rabbis have\n  deemed all animals to be muktza, regardless of their utility, then\n  even household pets are to be included I this category. However, if\n  one assumes the position that the possibility of using an animal to\n  amuse a child is insufficient utility to remove it from being\n  considered muktza, then a cogent argument can be made that a pet is\n  sufficiently useful to the extent that one no longer can say that they\n  have no purpose to their owners on Shabbat and Yom Tov, and hence are\n  not muktza.44</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shmuel David (Sheilot uteshuvot Meirosh Tzurim 38:6) concludes\n  his discussion of this issue with a citation of the opinion of Rabbi\n  Aharon Lichtenstein.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is proper to conduct himself in accordance with the stringent\n  opinion in this matter, since this appears to be the opinion of\n  Tosafot, Mordechai, Hagahot Oshri, and Rosh. Yet one need not admonish\n  those who practice in accordance with the lenient opinion in this\n  matter. Since this issue is embroiled in a dispute amongst the\n  Rishonim and the logic of those who rule leniently is compelling.\n  However, even according to the stringent opinion it is reasonable to\n  say that one may move a household pet to alleviate its suffering\n  (Yabia Omer 5:26). This is because some authorities permit moving\n  items which are undoubtedly muktza to spare an animal from suffering\n  (see Mishnah Berurah 305:70 and Chazon Ish 52:16). Since the question\n  as to whether household pets are muktza, is in dispute, there exists a\n  s'fek s'feka, a double doubt, which would lead one to rule leniently\n  in this ragard.45</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"41\">\n  <li>This explanation is also cited by Beit Yosef (Orach Chaim 308 s.v. kofin) and Mishnah Berurah (308:146). </li>\n  <li>See Tehilla Ledavid 308:42 for a distinction between Kosher and non-kosher animals regarding the category of muktza under which they\n  should be classified. </li>\n  <li>However, see Respnsa halachot Ketanot (number 45) who adopts a lenient position in this matter. Rabbi Shmuel David (Sheilot Uteshuvot\n  Meirosh Tzurim 38:6) cites Chief Sepharadic Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu\n  who rules leniently in this matter since the issue debated by the\n  Rishonim is a rabbinic law where one may rule leniently in case of\n  doubt. </li>\n  <li>Rabbi Shmuel David (Sheilot Uteshuvot Meirosh Tzurim) cogently argues that one who is accustomed to move his pets is analogous to\n  someone who prepares a rock prior to Shabbat for use on Shabbat. In\n  such cases the rock is no longer muktza since he has demonstrated that\n  the rock has utility for him on Shabbat (ordinarily, rocks are muktza\n  since they serve no purpose on Shabbat; once one demonstrated his use\n  for a rock then it is no longer classified as muktza). Similarly, one\n  who ordinarily moves his pets demonstrates thereby that they have\n  utility on Shabbat and hence are not muktza. Rabbi Auerbach (cited in\n  Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata 18, footnote 62) rules that seeing-eye dogs\n  are not muktza. He reasons that since their essential function is such\n  that they must necessarily be moved, then one surely intends to move\n  them on Shabbat and hence their designation as muktza is avoided.\n  Rabbi David points out that a rabbinic authority who rules that a\n  seeing-eye dog is not muktza would not necessarily rule that a\n  household pet is not muktza. One can distinguish between seeing-eye\n  dogs whose function requires their being moved (and hence one surely\n  intends prior to Shabbat to use them on Shabbat) and household pets\n  which are ordinarily moved but are not necessarily moved. </li>\n  <li>Rabbi Y. Neuwirth rules leniently in this regard, though he expresses some hesitation in doing so; see Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata\n  27:28 and 30 and footnote 98.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another relevant issue might be the prohibition of gozez (shearing), since it may be likely or inevitable that hair is pulled out of the dog in the course of petting. This is just a thought I had, though, and I'm not sure. </p>\n\n<p>Another remaining question, it seems, is to what extent indirect petting of your dog (i.e. with an object) would be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>A personal note: This prohibition initially caused me pain as a dog owner and lover who usually pets her dogs at every opportunity. I quickly learned, however, that some sweet words will readily assuage a dog, and dogs are actually <em>better</em> behaved (read: less spoiled) on the days you don't pet them.

    "content": "# Question on Mordechai -- Chiyuv m'drabbanan being motzei chiyuv m'doraisa\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mordechai in Megillah Siman 798 has a case if a blind person can make kiddush for his family since (according to Rebbe Yehuda) a blind person is patur from mitzvas, then his obligation in making Kiddush is only m'drabbanan. Howe can the D'rabbanan be motzei (or help the others fufill) their obligation that is d'oraisa. The Mordechai writes that we find a similar case in someone who makes Kiddush before it becomes night. That after plag hamincha (before the night but after a time someone can be makabel Shabbos) his obligation to make Kiddush would only be d'rabbanan (Tosesfes Shabbos is only d'rabbanan.) However when it becomes night there would be now a new obligation of kiddush m'doraisa. Still we say his kiddush made earlier takes care of the obligation that would be d'oraisa when it becomes night. This is the Mordechai's proof for the case of a blind person.</p>\n\n<p>The Minchas Chinnuch brings this in regards to the question of how a katan that becomes a bar mitzvah during sefira could continue counting with a bracha, his chiyuv before was only m'drabbanan and now is d'oraisa. However we see from the cases of the Mordechai that this question is answered.</p>\n\n<p>However there is a question that one could ask on the Mordechai. The Gemorah in Brachos (Daf 20) says that a katan who ate and now has to say bircas hamazon (m'drabbanan) cannot be motzei a Gadol that also ate a seudaha and is full that has to say bircas hamazon d'oraisa. Seemingly this is a kasha (question/difficulty) on the psak of the Mordechai. What achronim speak about this? What answers are given?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question is that of the Mogen Avraham !מגן אברהם סימן רסז ס\"ק א </p>\n\n<p>The Ketav Sofer responsa Ohr Hachaim siman 99 answers that the minchat chinuch holds like Rashi (רש\"י, ברכות מח sv ad sheyochal kezayit) that the child has no rabbinic chiyuv. The chiyuv is chinuch on the father- this explains why in Berachot 20b the katan CANNOT be motzei a Gadol. \nOne can still ask further how the katan can be motzei a gadol with a chiyuv derabbanan (i.e as the gemara there suggests that the father ate less than \"kedei Seviya\".The ketav sofer answers this to (although I found his lashon rather cryptic) I understand/intuited his meaning as follows: whereas a person who is totally exempt from a Mitzva cannot be Motzei even a a kiyuv derabbanan, here at least the child has a \"mitzva\" under the rubric of chinuich which is a level up from pure \"reshut\" and therefore he can be motzei the gadol witha chiyuiv derabbanan.\nThis is the chidush of the ketav sofer which wraps up the sources nicely </p>\n\n<p>The Maharam Shik שו\"ת מהר\"ם שיק או\"ח ס' רסט  (Rav Moshe Shik 1807-1879) also defends the Minchat Chinuch. Here is his \"shakle vetariya\" argumentation paraphrased as I understand it. Again his lashon is quite difficult (the acharonim wrote assuming their audience knew the suggayas of shas!)</p>\n\n<p>Maharm Shik (M’’S) asks the following question on the Minchas chinuch \nIf the Minchas chinuch follows the reasoning of the Modechai in the name of R’Tuvia of Vienna then we are left to tend to the challenge of the Mogen Avraham (i.e your question!)</p>\n\n<p>To answer this we say that the minor is not in the category of obligation and that is why in Brachot 20 he is unable to fulfil the obligation on behalf of the adult whose obligation is min hatorah. (this was the path of the Ketav Sofer above)</p>\n\n<p>[here the Maharam Shik (M''S) challenged this answer]\nIf that is the case then similarly by the minor who becomes bar mitzvah during sefirah we should apply the rule that since a minor is not a 'bar chiyuva' then he cant fulfil his future biblical obligation from this point.\n(only with a bar chiyua for example a blind man -can we apply the concept that he is able to fuilfil another's obligation since he will eventually become a fully fledged bar chiyuva deoraisa.)</p>\n\n<p>[in other words answering the Mogen Avrahams question by invoking Rashi only helps to solve the gemara in Brachot 20b but leads us to question the case of the Katan shehigdil betoch sefirat haomer- and the minchat chinuch was using the Mordechai (in the name of Rav Tuvia of Vienna) to prove that the kattan dies continue counting with a blessing!]</p>\n\n<p>The M’’S suggests the following answer: - \nHe suggests (a chidush no doubt) that the case in Brachot 20b (that a minor cannot be motzei a gadol who ate kedi seviya and has a biblical chiyuv to bentch)  – goes according to the opinion in Sukkah 46a that we don’t make a blessing asher kidishanu on a rabbinic mitzvah. In other words there is no relationship between a rabbinic obligation and biblical one, and hence the child who is rabbinically obligated cannot fulfil the fathers biblical obligation on his behalf. \nNote that according to this approach of M''S, we are no longer suggesting that the Minchat chinuch holds like Rashi that minor is not bar chiuyva. </p>\n\n<p>However we pasken in halacha that we do make a bracha on a rabbinic obligation (Ner Chanukah is the proof see- sukkah 46a). The reason is that a Rabininc chiuy is rooted in a generic biblical one of “Lo Tasur”.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this we can suggest that there is a relationship between the rabbinic obligation and biblical one, even though they are different levels of obligation, and therefore we can argue that the minor who is rabinincally obligated (not like Rashi who held he is not a bar chiyuva) can fulfil the Mitzva on behalf of another or on behalf of himself.</p>\n\n<p>So this defends the Minchas Chinuch who suggests based on the reasoning of the Mordechai -that the counting performed by a minor prior to Bar Mitzva is a fulfilment of a rabbinic obligation and this (similar to making Kiddush during tosefet Shabbat) can create the Chiyuv deoraitta for when he is Bar Mitzva and so he should continue to count with a Bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

According to this reason, if there was an actual doubt, you would not be able to count at all. As the Dvar Avraham explains, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל לפי דברינו הנ\"ל נראה לומר דבר חדש דדוקא ביו\"ט היו נוהגין אבותינו\n  לעשות ב' ימים מספיקא, אבל בספירה באמת לא הי' אפשר כלל לאבותינו לספור\n  שתי ספירות ביחד מספק לפי שזו אינה ספירה כלל כמ\"ש ובמקום ובזמן שהיו\n  מסופקין לא היה תקנה לדבר וצ\"ל שלא היו סופרין כלל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I recently saw that R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik objected to the Dvar Avraham's position precisely because it is inconceivable that before there was a fixed calendar, Jews were unable to perform the mitzvah of sefirat ha-omer. This would have meant that generations of Babylonian Amoraim would not have been able to perform this mitzvah, which is not mentioned anywhere in the Talmud. (Quoted in R. Hershel Schachter's <em>Nefesh HaRav</em>.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Ba'al Hameor and Ravad (both at the end of Pesachim) assume that the communities counted only one day, starting from the first day of Yom Tov. Whether or not they did this with a beracha would probably depend on whether or not you make a bracha on a mitzvah done out of doubt (Rambam to Milah 3:6 says no and the Ravad there argues; Ran Shabbos 23a agrees with the Ravad), though this may be different than the classic case of performing a mitzvah 'just in case'.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is though, even though they remained in doubt for the holidays, the diaspora communities clearly found out at when the right day of rosh chodesh is eventually, because we only have two days of yom tov, and not more (i.e. if they weren't sure when nissan or adar started, they should have 3 days of yom tov). Therefore, by the time Shavuot came around, they always knew when the right day was, and merely kept the second day to be consistent with other holidays (Rambam Hil. Kiddush HaChodesh 3:12).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I'm not sure what they did if they found out that they had the wrong day in the middle of sefirah; I assume that they would start counting correctly as soon as they got word that Adar was 29 days. The problem is that the Baal Hameor and Ravad both say that the <em>reason why</em> they wouldn't count two days of Omer is because we don't want to be counting the 49th day of the Omer and celebrating Shavuot at the same time - but (as the Rambam explianed) that should never happen anyway, because by Shavuot there's no reason to count twice!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it could very well be that they counted two days (at least until they found out what day it really was). Or, they might have believed, like the Devar Avraham (1:34) that counting two things at once can't really be called a count, and therefore they only counted one day. (The author of the Devar Avraham himself though is hesitant to accept that this is true).  </p>\n\n<p>I know this isn't really an answer but it's the best I've got, sorry. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Baal HaMaor asks (last piece on Pesachim) why we don't count twice for the ספיקא דיומא. He answers that if so, the count will go until the first day of Shavuos (i.e. you'll count \"today is 49\" on Shavuos itself), and we will come to disgrace Yom Tov. The Raavad answers the same question by saying that if we count on two days we will end up with a contradiction: we celebrate Shavuos, showing that the count has ended, yet we are also counting day 49!</p>\n\n\n",

However, the definition of tzedaka adopted by the chakhamim is much wider. According to the book by R. Shimon Taub \"<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195893.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Laws of Tsedakah and Maaser</a>\" section 1.B, the mitzvah of tzedakah is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mitzvah of tzedakah is relative to the needs of each individual poor person and one is obligated to give himbased on what he is lacking. As the Rambam writes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If one does not have clothing to wear, one should give him clothing</li>\n<li>One who does not have necessary furniture or household utensils should be given those items</li>\n<li>One who is not married should be helped to find an appropriate mate. (Rambam Matanos 'Oniim 7.3, Meiri Gm. Kesubos 67a and other sources)</li>\n<li>Furthermore if one is accustomed to having servants and then becomes impoverished the mitzvah is to rehabilitate his original status. (Gm. Kesubos 67b)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general one should ascertain what the poor person needs and attempt to provide him with those needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While certainly one fulfills the mitzvah of tzedakah by giving an indigent money (Shu\"T Divrei Malkiel Chelek 4 Si'15 and other sources), one can also explore other avenues to help people in the community. Even if people are relatively well off financially, it does not mean that that there is nothing they lack.

[...] Understand thoroughly my theory, that <strong>I do not ascribe to G-d ignorance of anything or any kind of weakness</strong>. I hold that Divine Providence is related and closely connected with the intellect, because Providence can only proceed from an intelligent being, from a being that is itself the most perfect Intellect. <strong>Those creatures, therefore, which receive part of that intellectual influence will become subject to the action of Providence in the same proportion as they are acted upon by the Intellect</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Angels have free will.(I know many in judaisme say otherwise,Let`s look at the logic)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In midrash that occasionally angels get \"punished,\" which shouldn't be possible if they lack free will.</p></li>\n<li><p>There Is also written in Talmud about rebellion from the Angels.</p></li>\n<li><p>And if you agree that Angels came to earth and live against Hashems will(Nephelim)\nThe Question is easy,If you want logic.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then you might argue,what is free will,but the question goes for humans as well?</p>\n\n\n",

I often need to work on Saturdays or late on Fridays, inhibiting my ability to attend synagogue on Shabbat. Sometimes I am required to work on other holidays as well.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard mixed things about this from other Jews:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some say that it is acceptable to \"do what I can\" and I should observe as often as practicable.</li>\n<li>Others have told me Judaism is \"all or nothing\" -- that it is a religion of strict rules -- and that I should attend synagogue despite important obligations like working to provide for my family.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are different philosophies within Judaism that support either point, but which is the prevailing view? Is there any Judaic text that can support either position?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 26)\n\n<p>It's not either/or but \"both, and\".</p>\n\n<p>Judaism has a system of rules, <em>halacha</em>, by which we are to live our lives.  Halacha is not negotiable, so that might sound like \"all or nothing\".  Instead, think of it as what you <em>aspire</em> to, even if it's not what you <em>currently do</em>.  <em>Halacha</em> calls on you to do all that you can, but also recognizes that all humans are imperfect and does not hold one failure against us in other areas.</p>\n\n<p>As Dan <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27988/472\">noted</a>, there are conditions where halacha itself provides for prioritization, but this is <em>built into</em> the halachic system, not something that individuals get to decide.  If you think your individual circumstances call for a leniency on any matter of halacha, you should <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146/472\">consult your rabbi for guidance</a>.  Your rabbi is in a position to evaluate the demands of halacha, your financial situation, your family situation, where you currently are in your growth in torah, and so on, and advise you about your job.</p>\n\n<p>When we face barriers to fulfilling the law we should be striving to remove them.  In your case, your job currently requires you to work on Shabbat.  Can you do anything about that?  Can you trade shifts with somebody, even if it means your new shift will be less convenient?  Can you find a new job that doesn't have this requirement?  If you can make either of those changes, so that you can remain employed and also keep Shabbat, Jewish tradition calls on you to do so.  Remove the barrier by changing jobs, rather than saying \"there's a barrier and I can't get past it\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm not trying to give you personal advice (that's not what Stack Exchange is for) but rather to illustrate an approach.  Yes, Judaism has rules, and when you violate them you are sinning.  Yes, Judaism has some affordances for sufficiently-severe circumstances (and for this you should consult your rabbi).  And yes, Judaism calls on you to take action yourself where you can to improve the situation instead of waiting for things to get better on their own.</p>\n\n<p>And, all that said, if what you're asking is \"if I can't do all of it should I do any of it?\", the answer is yes.  Every mitzvah you do counts in your merit; it is better to violate Shabbat and still follow other mitzvot than to say \"well, if I can't do Shabbat I'll just punt\".  Doing a mitzvah can lead you to do another; that's a good thing.  As it says in Pirke Avot (4:2): <em>mitzvah goreret mitzvah, aveirah goreret aveirah</em> -- one <em>mitzvah</em> leads to another <em>mitzvah</em>, one transgression leads to another transgression.</p>\n\n<p>(I realize that this answer is largely lacking in sources.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Judaism is indeed a religion with a large number of rules, but it is certainly not \"all or nothing.\" On one hand, the mitzvot are not considered to be simply guidelines.  They are strict rules that every Jew should be careful to follow.  So, in your example, Judaism says that you should not go to work on Shabbat. We have faith that we will be able to care for our families even if we do not work on Shabbat or holidays (and there are a large number of observant Jews with important jobs who show that this is possible).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the fact that someone does not keep one particular mitzvah does not mean that he should not do the other mitzvahs. Every mitzvah that a Jew does is a good thing.  The fact that one does not observe one particular mitzvah does not mean that it is not worth it for him to do another one. </p>\n\n<p>In Maimonides' \"Hilchot Teshuva\", he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"A person should always view himself as being half meritorious and half guilty [of sins]. Similarly, [one should view] the entire world -- half meritorious and half guilty... If he does one mitzvah, he [has the potential to favorably] tip the scales of himself and the entire world, and he brings for himself and all the world salvation and deliverance!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this, we can see that everybody sins sometimes.  Everybody fails to keep some of the mitzvot. But this does not mean that we should stop observing them. On the contrary, doing even one mitzvah can make a huge difference!</p>\n\n<p>So it's not \"do what I can\" in the way that you describe it, but it is also not \"all or nothing.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Don't forget that Kohelet said \"For there isn't a righteous person on earth who does only good and never sins\". Do as much as you can and always strive to do better. If not being able to keep Shabbat properly upsets you enough, you will find another job that enables you to keep Shabbat, and so on for all the rest. I heard once \"How can a Tzaddik sin?\" - and the answer was that for a Tzadik, if his thoughts are not perfect - that his his sin. Try to add one thing better each week.</p>\n\n\n",

All questions below are questions about the narrative of the story based on the interpretation of Chazal and Rashi. </p>\n\n<p>Why is Ammorah (Gomorrah) punished if all the evil seems to only be occurring in Sodom? For example, chazal see the \"cry of Sodom and Ammorah\" (Bereshis 18:20) as referring to torture performed in Sodom only (see Sanhedrin 109a-b). I am not aware of any source that shows any evil doings in Ammorah at all. </p>\n\n<p>It seem that in fact there were were 5 cities scheduled to be destroyed (hence Avraham's initial request of 50 righteous people - see Rashi to Bereshis 18:24). However, similar to the previous question, if there is only an outcry from 2 (really 1) why are these other cities being destroyed?</p>\n\n<p>Was the city of Tzoar in fact saved because of Lot (19:21, Rashi)? If this is the case then why was Lot removed from Sodom by the angel in the first place? Meaning, if Lot (and his daughters) have enough merit to save a city, why do they only have enough to save Tzoar, and not Sodom?</p>\n\n<p>If Tzoar is saved, why does Lot leave? It says he was afraid (19:30) but gives no indication as to why.</p>\n\n<p>Why didn't the Angel just take Lot out of the entire vicinity instead of only out of Sodom (19:16)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>About Tzoar (will try to add more if time allows). I believe the traditional approach is that its execution was temporarily suspended to give Lot a short-term refuge, and after he leaves to the mountains shortly, that city is also destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>In a beautiful exposition, the <em>Akeydas Yitzchak</em> notes a verse in Devarim (29:22) that Moshe lists 4 out of 5 cities in the valley that were destroyed, but Tzoar is not among them. Based on that, he claims that not only Lot and his daughters, but other righteous individuals in the valley all totalling 10, were gatherd in Tzoar to save it permanenmtly in Avraham's merit, as his last request entailed the city be saved on the account of 10 righteous individuals therein, and Hashem granted it.</p>\n\n<p>This is why Lot couldn't stay in Sodom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong> I think Sodom and Amora were the largest cities in the valley, (and Sodom was greater). That's why the verses generally refer to Sodom and Amora but not to the other cities. They were just as bad, except Tzoar (see Lots' remark on 19:20 and Rashi therein).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While I don't have much too add, there is a relevant source here. see Shabbos 10b, all the way on the bottom. Gemarah discusses how tzoar was one year younger than sedom, and therefore not condemned. What may remain, though, is whether it wasn't condemned then, meaning it still had some time, or that it wasn't condemned, meaning not included in this destruction?</p>\n\n\n",

Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: He sent forth upon them the <strong>fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation and trouble</strong> (Ps. 78:49). What is meant by the fierceness of His anger? R. Simeon the son of Yohai said: Five plagues resulted from His anger, as it is said: How much more when I send My four judgments against Jerusalem, the sword and the famine and the wild beast and the pestilence (Ezek. 14:21). What is the fifth plague? The drought. How do we know this? R.

R. Joshua bar Nehemiah said: The Sodomites also were liable to fire because they had erupted into sexual perversion. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:24): THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE. When they were found guilty, the Holy One said to the angels: Why are you standing about? Go and destroy them. They immediately descended and carried out the keleusis {i.e., the command} of their Creator. Where is it shown?

Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: But they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit; therefore, He was turned to be their enemy, He Himself fought against them (Isa. 6:10). R. Jeremiah the son of Eleazar declared: The Holy One, blessed be He, had warned the men of Sodom to repent for fifty-two years <strong>by causing the mountains to quake over them</strong>. R. Simeon the son of Yohai said: A biblical verse supports this statement: <strong>Who removeth the mountains, and they know it not, when He overturneth them in His anger</strong> (Job 9:5). When they failed to repent, He destroyed them. What was the source of their punishment? The heavens. R. Simeon the son of Lakish stated: Heaven resembles an urn from which a man may draw hot or cold water as he desires. When the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to do so, He sent manna to the Israelites from heaven, as it is said: Behold, I will cause bread to rain for you from heaven (Exod. 16:14), but when He so desired: Then the Lord caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven (Gen. 19:24).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The degree of destruction is commented by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.25?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak on Bereshis 19:25</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויהפך, He turned these cities and the valley from having been most fruitful to becoming most desolate.

He turned over the works of the generation of the flood, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23), “And he wiped out all living things.” <strong>He turned over the works of the Sodomites, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25), “And he overturned those cities.”</strong> He turned over the works of the Egyptians, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Exod. 14:28), “and not so much as one of them remained.” He turned over the works of Babylon, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Is. 14:22), “and from Babylon i will cut off name, remnant, offspring, and posterity.” Moreover, David has said about all of them (in Ps. 36:13), “There the evildoers have fallen; they are thrust down and cannot rise.” <strong>When Israel falls, however, it stands up [again], as stated (in Micah 7:8), “Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall arise….”</strong> It also says (in Mal. 3:6), “For I the Lord do not change; [and you, O Children of Jacob, are not destroyed (rt.: klh).” R. Hanina bar Pappa said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I have never smitten a people and [restored] them, but (according to Mal. 3:6), “you Children of Jacob are not destroyed,”’ This is as stated (in Deut. 32:23), ‘I will use up (rt.: klh) My arrows on them,’ [meaning that] My arrows are used up (rt.: klh) but they are not destroyed (rt.: klh).” And so has the assembly of Israel said (in Lam. 3:12), “He has bent his bow; he has set me as a target for the arrow.” To what is the matter comparable? To a warrior who raises up the [target] post and shoots the arrows at them. The arrows are used up (rt.: klh), but the post stands. So it is also with Israel. Every time that afflictions came upon them, the afflictions ended, and they were standing in their place. Ergo it is stated (in Prov. 12:7), “The wicked are overturned and are no more.” ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Notice in <strong>Genesis 19:28</strong> that Abraham saw the fire still burning the next morning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>looking down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the Plain, he saw the smoke of the land rising like the smoke of a kiln.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A simple, non-symbolic explanation would be that the fire ignited the cities and the sulphur melted, stuck to everything and everyone, and burned until it was all consumed.

Chochma is unchanging and constant, therefore it corresponds to ארץ because אין כל חדש תחת השמש, and similarly a Navi is not allowed to create a new Mitzvah, because the chochma of the Torah is unchanging.  Therefore יסד is past tense, because it happened in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Binah is the contemplation and understanding that an individual has of that information, the way he personally relates to it.  It is therefore constantly changing as generations come and go.  Thus, corresponding to binah, כונן is present tense, and is matched with שמים which is מחדש בכל יום (I do not know how he knows that \"mechadesh b'tuvo b'chol yom\" refers to shamayim and not aretz, but I assume it is because otherwise it would contradict \"ein kol chadash tachas hashemesh\").</p>\n\n<p>This seems to match Rashi's explanation (quoted in an answer above) that chochma is what you learn from others (the information) and binah is extrapolating your own deductions.</p>\n\n<p>He does not explain what Da'as is, but Nefesh Hachaim, also a talmid of the Gra\"h, explains (Sha'ar aleph perek 6) that da'as is connection - which would mean that da'as is becoming connected to the information.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Noah have to wait so long to exit the ark?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is actually several similar questions compounded together. I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way, but it seems like Noah had the opportunity (and I'm sure he had the motive) to leave the ark before he actually did, and I'm wondering if someone can explain why.</p>\n\n<p>Starting in Bereishit Chapter 8, Verse 4, it says Noah's ark came to rest on the mountains in the seventh month. So why not leave the ark then? (I believe Seder Olam ch. 4 says because the bottom of the boat was 11 cubits below the surface... but drying at a rate of 4 cubits per month seems a bit slow compared to how fast it must have dried afterwards.) Then it says in the tenth month that the mountain peak was visible. So why not leave the ark then? 54 days later the dove couldn't find anywhere to land... What was wrong with the mountain peak, I mean it had two months to dry in the sun by then? Another week later, the twelfth month, the dove found an olive branch and Noah knew the waters had gone. Aside from the question of how did a new olive tree grow so fast, why didn't Noah go and get some leg room and let the animals walk around outside for the first time in a year right away, when it was good enough for the dove? Then, why does it say the waters had dried up in the first month if the dove was successful in its mission to find land the previous month? Why not go out now? And then a month later, the second month, it says the ground dries again, why did it even mention when it dried the first time? And then if God told Noah when to leave the ark, why did he bother send out birds and looking to see if the ground was dry?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains as follows (Likkutey Sichos vol. 25, pg. 28 - adapted in English <a href=\"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=HYLi3l9ylWwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<p>The Ark contained a pair of every species of animal known to man. The fact that they could co-exist in a structure measuring 300 X 50 X 30 handbreadths for an entire year was nothing short of a miracle. In fact, it was a taste of the Messianic era when, (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15942/jewish/Chapter-11.htm#v6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshayahu 11:6-9</a>) \"A wolf shall live with a lamb, and a leopard shall lie with a kid..\" In this case, it is easy to understand Noach's reluctance to leave the Ark until explicitly commanded to by G-d; having been exposed to such a high level of supernatural behaviour resembling the Messianic era, he was in no hurry to go out.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is in addition to the answer posted above based on the Lubavitcher Rebbe. This addition addresses the contradiction comment to that answer.</p>\n\n<p>The answer that Noach was reluctant to leave is in addition the fact that being explicitly commanded to \"Enter the Ark\" (Bereishis 7:1), he was not allowed to leave until explicitly commanded by G-d to \"Go out of the Ark\" (Bereishis 8:16).  </p>\n\n<p>This reinforces the question: Why did Noach send out the birds if could not (and did not want to) leave the Ark?</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains as follows (Hitva’aduyot 5745, vol. 4, pp. 2407–2409 - adapted in English in Daily Wisdom by Kehot  <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/Daily-Wisdom-Standard-size-55-x-85/productinfo/ERE-DAIL.L/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://store.kehotonline.com/Daily-Wisdom-Standard-size-55-x-85/productinfo/ERE-DAIL.L/</a>)</p>\n\n<p>As the Torah will recount, Noah did not leave the ark until G‑d told him to do so. So what was the purpose of seeing if the land was dry by sending out these birds?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that since G‑d had entrusted him with the survival of life, Noah felt responsible to take whatever natural steps would encourage G‑d to hasten the renewal of life on earth.</p>\n\n<p>The pain of exile is compared to the raging waters of the Flood. Like the Flood, only G‑d can end the exile. But, like Noah, we can hasten the redemption by actively yearning for it and doing all in our power to hasten its arrival.</p>\n\n\n",

It is thus named because it \"dwells\" in and is \"enclothed\" in the physical world. Like the verse \"v'shochanti b'soicham\" - \"and I will in them.\" (See Maamar quoted below.)

Of course, in order to carry the phone, there would need to be an eruv. The argument was that the phone is not muktzeh if it is being used specifically for the purpose of time-telling.</p>\n\n<p>Has anybody else ever heard this, and is this idea sourced anywhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I would like to add that the mishna brura in 'סימן שח' סעיף קטן יב says that one should not use an item that is a kli shemelachto lissur if a kli that is muttar is available.

Most cell phones today, especially so-called \"smartphones,\" have gyroscope sensors in them and you will be causing circuits to change state merely by jostling them around. </p>\n\n<p>As for question 4, it seems to me that if your cell phone is displaying the time, then it is also on, and so, if a non-Jew calls you, then it will ring, and that would be zilzul shabbos for sure, all other issues aside.

Also, each phone would have to be individually certified for \"clock use on Shabbos\" since the factors are sufficiently complicated that a general ruling would not cut it.

Since Shabbat had already begun when the ship docked, those on board asked R. Gamaliel if they could disembark.  He said yes, because he had observed that the ship was close enough before Shabbat started.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously R.

Gamaliel could make that ruling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Perhaps the ship was <em>obviously</em> close enough.  In that case I would have expected the answer he gave to say something about \"yes you can move from a vessel to land\", rather than bringing up the distance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Perhaps R.

Gamliel was able to measure the distance. The Gemara says that R. Gamliel had a hollow tube with which he was able to look and sight a distance of 2000 Amos. Per Rashi a long hollow tube narrows and shortens the viewer's range. The length of the tube can be calibrated to yield a maximum sighting distance of 2000 Amos. (thanks to Artscroll for the translation).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A normal person can see about three miles. This is about three times the length of the tchum. So his tube was meant to shorten his length of sight. The gemoro in Bchoros where it talks about a shepherd guarding his flock says he can see sixteen mil, a lot more than three miles. How does one reconcile this with the facts. One could say the gemoro means that it is the maximum a shepherd can see even if standing at a great height. But that would mean that every field contains such a 'height'. \nThe MB says that when making an eruv and standing in the middle, if imagining there are no houses or other obstacles in the way one can see the walls. Which would mean an eruv cannot be larger than 6 miles in lenght or breadth.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that he learned that from a \"little-known\" halacha at Shulchan Aruch § 109, which he says requires that he daven separately from the congregation (either in the hallway or in the women's section) if the congregation has begun the Shemoneh Esrei before him.  Otherwise, he says, he has to wait for them.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the S.A. § 109 as included in the Mishna Brurah.  My Hebrew isn't that great, so maybe I missed something, but I couldn't find anything there that told me he had to separate himself from the congregation.

    "content": "# Is there a Jewish symbol for evil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a Jewish equivalent to Christian's upside-down cross, a symbol that some Christians believe to mean \"evil\" or the \"devil.\"</p>\n\n<p>Does the \"average\" Jew have a visual symbol which might be taken to mean evil or the devil?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya, Frederick.  </p>\n\n<p>The \"average\" Jew does not have a symbol for \"evil\" or the \"devil,\" especially the latter.  The \"devil\" is a Christian innovation shared also by Islam, and which probably owes some of its origins from pagan and other non-Christian sources such as Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, both of which are dualistic religions.  Moreover, the Christian visage of the Devil has evolved greatly over the centuries.  Since this site is about Judaism and not about Christianity, I will refer you to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil\">Wikipedia</a> as my source for that info.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism does not recognize the personage of \"the Devil\" and it understands the angel Satan in a much different way than Christians understand him.  The Hebrew Scriptures do not make much reference to Satan.  He appears principally in the Book of Job.  At Job 1:6 the verse refers us to a group of angels it calls the \"sons of G-d\" or in Hebrew, \"b'nai HaElokim.\"  When the Hebrew Scriptures use the word \"Elokim\" [note that I am intentionally misspelling it as it is a Name of G-d], it refers to G-d when His attribute of justice-seeking is most prominent.  Therefore the \"b'nai Elokim\" are those angels who serve that particular attribute.  The verse describes Satan as one of those angels.  There and the subsequent paragraphs Satan is clearly working for G-d, acting here as an accusor of Job, which is appropriate as the word \"satan\" means \"adversary.\"  Throughout the Book of Job, the Satan clearly takes his orders from G-d.  Judaism does not have a concept of fallen angels or one that is as out-of-control as the Christian Satan seems to be.  To accept that concept, one would have to reject the concepts that G-d is the only god (Deut. 6:4; Isa. 45:5) and the concepts that G-d gave us the inclination to do good and the inclilnation to do evil when He gave us Free Will.  Deut. 30:15-20.  It is from other religions that Christianity got the idea that Good and Evil are at constant war and G-d is on the side of Good, and the Devil is on the side of Bad.  To accept that idea, we would also have to believe that G-d doesn't win every battle.  </p>\n\n<p>G-d created good and evil, as He did all things.  Isa. 45:7.  He had to when He gave us free will, otherwise we would be sock puppets in a play not of our own choosing.  The evil and good that we choose are relative.  The ultimate good that G-d creates is Choice, i.e. Free Will, and our ultimately capability to overcome our evil inclination.</p>\n\n<p>There may have been, from time to time, images that were understood to be inherently evil to Jews, the Swastica for one, but they were not our images in the first place and are merely images we associate with the evil done to us.</p>\n\n\n",

They have many food items that need to be prepared and set up for the Kiddush however the preparation involves the malacha of borer and therefore should normally be done close to the seudah (let's say they need to peel certain fruits, eggs, etc but perhaps won't run into problems of having to remove bad parts of the food from the good.)</p>\n\n<p>There are gentiles that work in the Shul and are able to set up the Kiddush. However they'd rather finish their work early in the morning (around 8, 9 am and leave instead of hanging around the shul or coming later at 11 am to set up for the Kiddush). Thus perhaps creating a problem since the malacha of \"borer\" that what they will do will not be done \"somach\" (close) to the beginning of the seudah, rather several hours before. Borer can be permitted with certain conditions, however as far as I know one condition is that it has to be \"somach\" (close) to the beginning of the seudah.</p>\n\n<p>Is one allowed to tell them to set up for the Kiddush, knowing that they will set it up early? Or must they be told to specifically set up for the Kiddush at a later time when it will be closer to the start of the seudah? What proofs could be brought to support a psak one way or the other?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 319,1 specifies how to do borer on Shabbos permissibly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם בירר בידו כדי לאכול לאלתר מותר:<br>\n  Only if he separates with his hands (not with a specialized instrument) for eating straight away is permitted.    </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Rema Orach Chaim 319,1 explains the meanig \"straight away\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה: וכל מה שבורר לצורך אותה סעודה שמיסב בה מיד מקרי לאלתר (המגיד פרק ח' ורבינו ירוחם נתיב י\"ב חלק ח' ובית יוסף, וטור, ורא\"ש)<br>\n  Anything which was separated in a permissible manner for the sake of the  upcoming meal is called \"straight away\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Biur Halacha says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עיין במ\"ב ועיין בספר תוספת ירושלים שהוכיח מן הירושלמי דבעינן לאלתר ממש ודלא כהרמ\"א ונראה דמ\"מ אין להחמיר בזה דדברי הרמ\"א יש להם מקור מן הש\"ס שלנו וכמו שהביא ראיה בביאור הגר\"א<br>\n  See the Sefer Tosfos Yerushalayim that proves from Talmud Yerushalmi that one can only separate in a permissible manner to eat straight away (not for the upcoming meal in a few hours) unlike the view of the Rema. But it seems that we do not need to be machmir to follow the Yerushalmi as the Rema has his sources from the Talmud Bavli which we follow in Halacha see the Biur HaGra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a lot of shuls nowadays the Ladies Guild prepares the Kiddush 1 or 2 hours sometimes even 3 hours before the Kiddush (e.g on Rosh Hashana). Those that can afford non-Jewish workers also prepare the Kiddush in advance for the upcoming Seuda i.e the Kiddush. <strong>So long as they are not preparing Shalosh Seudos in the morning before Kiddush, Jewish volunteers or Non-Jewish workers can prepare for the Kiddush coming up after davening several hours beforehand</strong> like the Pesak of the Rema, the Gra and the Biur Halacha as long as the Rabbi explains to the Jewish volunteers that the <strong>Food must be taken from its waste</strong> (except with peeling/cracking nuts as stated by questioner), and specialized implements should <strong>not</strong> be used. <strong>A gentile may do borer (the Jew should not provide special equipment or tell him to take the bad from the good) as  if he could have achieved the same result in a permissible way*</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Note:If the gentiles decide to do Borer in a non permitted way since they could have done the same job in permitted way with the same results this is not called Amira Leakum as they are doing Borer for there own convenience see Shulchan Aruch 325,10 where it says if a Gentile does a Melacha for himself the Jew can benefit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You ask for sources that can be brought to support a decision. There are a number of elements to weigh in (extracted from <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899068800.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The sanctity of Shabbos</a> by R Simcha Bunim Cohen on the laws of non-Jews on Shabbos, pp. 29-40)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Amira l'akum</em></strong>: it is prohibited to tell a non-Jew to do a <em>melacha d'orayta</em> (forbidden Torah prohibition) on Shabbat</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Shvut d'shvut</em></strong>: In certain circumstances, it is permitted to tell a non-Jew to perform a <em>melacha d'rabanan</em> (rabbinic prohibition), specifically to avert a substancial financial loss, for a mitzvah, to alleviate considerable pain and to maintain human dignity</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Oneg shabbat</em></strong>: <em>shvut d'shvut</em> applies to asking a non-Jew to do a <em>melacha d'rabanan</em> for the sake of Shabbat enjoyment. <em>Oneg shabbat</em> includes the three Shabbat meals. Therefore one may ask a non-Jew to do a <em>melacha d'rabanan</em> to arrange for those items that are basic to the Shabbat meals.</p>\n\n<p>R Cohen lists the foods that are considered basic to most people and included in that permission: wine, challah, fish, meat. He excludes kugel, salads, drinks, desserts (and sources it from what he heard in the name of R Moshe Feinstein, R Chaim Pinchas Steinberg and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Roth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Yechezkel Roth</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Borer</em></strong>: your question is on <em>borer</em> (selecting) specifically. Shemirah Shabbat Kehilchata writes explicitly (3:62) that, in case of a large meal, one can select early in advance of a meal (\"considerable time beforehand\", \"even if the meal considers of different courses one wishes to prepare before the guests arrive\") <strong>BUT NOT to select food for a meal which is not yet due to begin, even though he wishes to do so in order to enable him to go home before time for the meal arrives.</strong> R Daniel Braude (<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1988022304\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Learn Shabbos</a>, p. 184) rules the same way. But it is not clear if they are addressing Jews or non-Jews.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To get to a decision, a rav would have to weigh on these different factors, and possibly combine some leniencies, e.g., maybe eggs and fruit are by now essential to <em>oneg Shabbat</em> and maybe <em>borer</em> is permitted in advance if it is done by a non-Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have now seen in the <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/rabbi-dovid-cohen/food-service-mashgiach-guidebook/paperback/product-23442509.html?ppn=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Food Service Mashgiach Guidebook</a> from R Dovid Cohen of the <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CRC</a>, pp. 127-128 that he answers your question and forbids it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hand/manual peelers may be used \"close to the team\" for food to be\n  used at that meal. For example, if the <em>Shabbos</em> morning <em>seudah</em> is\n  scheduled for 11am and it takes 3 hours to prepare for that meal,\n  8-11am is considered \"close to that meal\" for that situation. Peelers\n  could be used during that time for salads to be served at the morning\n  <em>seudah</em> but peelers cannot be used ... before 8am. Non-Jews may dice vegetables finely if they do so \"close to the team\" for food to be\n  used at that meal (as explained above).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Earlier (pp. 124-125) he explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>non-Jews can do <em>melacha</em> for their own benefit but not on a Jew's\n  property, because people who see him doing the <em>melacha</em> will think\n  the Jew specifically told him to do it on Shabbos. In this context,\n  the areas of the kitchen which are not open to the public (the \"back\n  of the house\") are NOT treated as being a \"Jew's house\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the final answer might depend whether or not the non-Jews doing the work are visible to the public.</p>\n\n\n",

It already said that something baked cannot become Chametz. Something that was baked and something that was baked then boiled have both been baked. So if that's what the Beraisa actually meant, it was redundant (not to mention misleading).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, another answer comes to mind which would address the Gemorah's concern about lukewarm water very nicely: Pour the grain or flour into water that is already boiling. Why does the Gemorah not even suggest this answer? That answer seems to fit much more nicely with the Beraisa while addressing the Gemorah's concern just as well.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am a bit biased, this question jumped out at me from a wish that oatmeal and cream of wheat would be Kosher for Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

So for example, a bottle of 100% apple juice, even if it hasn't been certified that you can know 100% sure that there was no contamination, would certainly have no more than such a small and undetectable amount of Chametz.

He answered that since on the one hand Chazal teach in several places that there are 613 mitzvos, and on the other hand there are clearly many more mitzvos than this, a set of rules are needed in order to determine which mitzvos should be included in the list of 613. Each one of these early authorities had his own set of rules (the Rambam spells out clearly what his rules are) and thus they each end up with a different list.</p>\n\n<p>And the importance of working out which mitzvos go into the list is this: there are many mitzvos mentioned in the gemara which are not clear if they are d'oraisa (from the Torah) or d'rabanan (from the Rabbis). Even when a mitzvah seems to be derived from a posuk sometimes it is only an asmachta (a mitzvah d'rabanan which is supported by the Torah, but which does not come from the Torah). But if the mitzvah is in the list of the 613, then it is most definitely d'oraisa.

It additionally states that \"even if someone admits that Hashem rules everything, but imagines that He gave over running of the world to an angel or star, he is considered one who accepts idol worship and transgresses \"You shall not have any other gods\"... rather he should believe that G-d himself and in His full glory oversees all the worlds and that no creation has any power to do anything except as He wills.\" Later, the Biur Halacha writes that the positive commandment of Shema is to know that, among other things, \"Hashem is one without any \"shituf\" - anyone else at all.\"</p>\n\n<p>I copied the relevant passage from Biur Halacha here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב) שלא נאמין בשום אלהים זולתו שנאמר לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים על פני ואפילו מודה שהקב\"ה שולט על הכל רק שידמה בדעתו שמסר הנהגת העולם למלאך או לכוכב ה\"ז מודה בע\"ז ועובר על לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים על פני אלא יאמין שהקב\"ה בעצמו ובכבודו משגיח בכל העולמות ואין לשום נברא כח לעשות דבר בלתי רצונו ולכן נקרא הקב\"ה אלהי האלהים. ג) לייחדו שנא' שמע ישראל ה' אלהינו ה' אחד ופירושו שמע ישראל ודע כי ה' שהווה את הכל ברצונו והוא אלהינו המשגיח בכל העולמות הוא ה' אחד בלי שום שיתוף.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Pardon that I don't have a Rabbinic source to cite, but:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 20:3</a> You shall not have the gods of others in My presence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would appear to state that <em>there exist</em> the gods of others.

Apparently the fire was started by a hot plate that had been left on for Shabbat.   </p>\n\n<p>I did a search to see whether smoke alarms themselves somehow violate Shabbat when I found this site. Many of the responses to this predicament involve moving or covering the offending smoke alarm rendering it useless.  Unless it is one of many smoke detectors in the home (which, by rights, it should be) <strong>this could be a deadly mistake</strong>.  From what I've read in the manuals of my own detectors, the chirping smoke alarm continues to function as a smoke alarm for a period of time while it reminds you to change the battery.  <strong>If you have no alternative then you must simply live with the annoying chirping until after Shabbat.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If this is impossible, then find a way to reconcile your sabbath observance with the need to preserve life and change the battery anyway.  Surely saving life takes precedence over any Jewish law.</p>\n\n<p>The best \"solution\" is to prevent this from even happening in the first place.  Change the batteries twice a year.  They used to say when you change the clocks but now that we have \"standard time\" only 4 months and daylight time for 8 perhaps a different schedule makes sense.  Perhaps before Passover (when looking for Chametz you can change the battery) and then again before Succos as part of one of that holiday's rituals?  Better yet, if you can afford it, replace your smoke alarms with the new type that have sealed 10-year batteries and are either hard-wired or communicate wirelessly so one sounding will sound all of them. </p>\n\n<p>Do it in memory of the Sassoon family of Brooklyn, New York.  Nobody should have to suffer their anguish because they chose to observe a religious ritual. Please don't be offended by a non-observant suggestion.  It's just so hard to see so much suffering.     </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Comparrison of Tefillin to the Beis HaMikdash\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Darchei Moshe in the beginning of Hilchos Tefillin, Siman 32, cites from the Mordechai (Halachos Katanos) the following: One has to make the mitzvah (of tefillin) \"nice\" on the outside, \"and chol shecain\" (a fortiori) the inside (of the Tefillin) should be made nice -- because we find of the Beis HaMikdash that the inside was from Zahav Taharah (pure gold).</p>\n\n<p>Why is he drawing a comparison from the Beis HaMikdash to Tefillin? What connection do they have? Why because the Beis HaMikdash was \"nicer\" on the inside then it was on the outside (seemingly) must we then make tefillin nice (or nicer) on the inside than it is on the outside?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Both Tefillin and the Beis Hamikdash have insides which are not seen by the general public, therefore there would be a tendency to attach more importance making both look nice on the outside.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>After our class that gave us an in-depth look at the Beis HaMikdash with explanations for everything from architecture to what was kept inside, I drew an immediate connection to Tefillin. We discussed it a bit, but after searching further, I found this tidbit to be insightful:</p>\n<p>Rabbi Zvi Sobolofsky\nYiras Shomayim - The Secret of Tefillin\n\"V'ra'ooh kol amei ha'aretz ki shem Hashem nikra alecha v'yra'ooh mimeka - and the nations of the land will see that the Name of Hashem will be upon you and they will fear you.\"(Devraim 28:10). Chazal (Menachos 35b) interpret this passuk as referring to the tefillin shel rosh which contain the Name of Hashem. The Rambam (Hilchos Tefillin 4:25) writes that wearing tefillin enables a person to become a yarei Shomayim - one who fears Hashem. What is unique about this mitzva that it is a catalyst for yiras Shomayim for both the one who wears tefillin and for the one who sees the tefillin being worn?</p>\n<p>There are several halachos that pertain to tefillin that may help us understand the relationship between tefillin and yiras Shomayim. Hilchos Tefillin contains includes details that resemble halachos relating to the Beis Hamikdash. Unlike other objects used for mitzva purposes such as tzitzis or a lulav, tefillin have kedusha similar to objects used in the Beis Hamikdash and cannot simply be discarded when no longer usable. Tefillin must be made from the parts of a kosher animal, and this halacha also governed the construction of the Mishkan (see Shabbos 28a), whereas concerning other mitzvos this may not apply (See Ran in Rosh Hashana 6a on the Rif for why shofar may also be included in this rule). The Rosh in (Hilchos Tefillin siman 18) derives the halacha that one cannot have a separation between one's body and the tefillin from the halacha that invalidates such a separation between the clothing worn by the kohein in the Beis Hamikdash and the body of the kohein. The requirements to concentrate on tefillin while they are worn is derived from a similar obligation incumbent upon the kohein gadol when he wears the tzitz - the ornament worn by the kohein gadol which has Hashem's Name engraved on it (see Yoma 7b).</p>\n<p>Even the shape of the tefillin indicates a connection to the Beis Hamikdash, as both Tefillin and the mizbeach in the Beis Hamikdash must be square. Not only do the halachos that govern tefillin highlight the similarities between tefillin and the Beis Hamikdash, but the very name given to part of the tefillin reinforces this connection. The box of the tefillin which enclose the parshiyos is called a bayis- a house. The imagery of a house built around the words of Torah is clearly reminiscent of the Mishkan and later the Beis Hamikdash constructed around the aron hakodesh which contained the words of Torah inscribed on the luchos.</p>\n<p>It is this component of mikdash that endows the tefillin with the ability to instill yiras Shamayim. The Beis Hamikdash is a place of awe. Yaakov Avinu, upon realizing that he had slept in the makom hamikdash declared, \"ma norah hamakom hazeh - How awe inspiring is this place.\" The halacha obligates us to be a in a state of mora - awe upon entering the Beis Hamikdash. Similarly as we wear our bayis of kedusha - our tefillin - we and all those around us should be inspired by the awe of Hashem's words that we carry with us.</p>\n<p>In the Parsha of \"v'haya im shamo'ah\" the mitzva of tefillin is written immediately following the pesukim that describe our being exiled from Eretz Yisrael. The Torah is teaching us that even in galus in the absence of the real Beis Hamikdash we still have our batim of tefillin. This special role tefillin have specifically at a time of churban is highlighted by our practice of wearing tefillin during Mincha on Tisha B'Av. After having spent the entire morning focusing on the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash, the first mitzvah that we perform to begin the process of comfort is putting on our tefillin. We realize that even in galus we can still attain yiras Shomayim by learning the lesson of tefillin. As we come close to the end of the seven weeks of comfort following Tisha B'Av, we turn to the parshiyos and the batim of our tefillin. May we merit attaining the yiras Shomayim they can induce, thereby meriting the construction of the ultimate bayis which will once again house the words of Hashem.</p>\n<p>© 2011 by TorahWeb Foundation.

For instance, praying at a synagogue on a regular weekday morning is \"strongly preferred\" over praying at home, but not required. A competent rabbi might very well feel that the single dad who is truly knee-high in caring for young children should focus only on absolute halachic requirements and nothing else is expected of him. On the other hand, we should consider overall spiritual wellbeing -- a person can probably stay alive on water and nutrient concentrates for several weeks, but that's unlikely to be good for them; similarly, there's nothing absolutely requiring a Jewish man to appear in synagogue<sup>1</sup> (other than maybe a few special occasions a year), but I think generally we should try to arrange things that he can do so at least twice a month, for the sake of his emotional, social, and spiritual health.

As he writes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19979&st=&pgnum=91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Or L'Zion</em> 2:7:24</a>, in the last paragraph of the footnotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮ומכל מקום אשה הטופלת בילדים ועסוקה בכך כל היום ואין לה פנאי במשך היום להתפלל, פטורה לגמרי מן התפילה, שהרי היא כעוסק במצוה הפטור מן הצוה. (וכן דעת החפץ חיים, וכפי שהובא בשיחות הח״ח  חלק א׳ אות כ״ז, ע״ש). ואף אינה חייבת בתשלומין, וכמבואר בברכ״י בסימן צ״ג אות ג׳, וראה עוד בכה״ח שם אות ט״ו. והוא הדין לאיש, שאם האשה אינה בבית, כגון שהלכה ללדת, והבעל צריך לטפל בילדים ואינו מוצא זמן להתפלל, שפטור מן התפּילה משום עוסק במצוה, ואף אינו חייב בתשלומין.</p>\n<p>In any case, a woman who is taking care of children and is occupied thusly the whole day, and doesn't have time during the day to pray, is completely exempt from <em>tefillah</em>, since she is like one who is engaged with a <em>mitzvah</em> and is exempt from [another] <em>mitzvah</em>. [...] And this is also the case for a man, where if the woman is not at home, for example she is giving birth, and the husband needs to take care of the children and cannot find time to pray, that he is exempt from <em>tefillah</em> due to <em>osek bemitzvah</em> [being engaged with another <em>mitzvah</em>], and is not even required to make up the missed prayer [<em>tashlumin</em>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although women are obligated in prayer <em>in spite</em> of being exempt from many time-bound <em>mitzvot</em>, it seems to me that one could extrapolate from the extension here to men to include other <em>mitzvot</em> that cannot be done while taking care of the children.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ramabm counts this as a Mitzvas aseh (positive commandment). However one could have the following doubt: If the Cohen Gadol took a basuleh when he was a Cohen hediyot and then became a Cohen Gadol, would he now be required to take another basuleh (get married again)? If so, since (according to the Rambam) a Cohen Gadol is not allowed to have two wives, he would have to divorce the first wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why does the Chasam Sofer have this doubt that the Cohen Gadol should then get married <em>again</em>? Meaning <em>if</em> the Cohen Gadol would want to get married he needs to marry a basuleh. However in this case that he's already married, why should davka get married again when he becomes the Cohen Gadol?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are some <em>mitzvos</em> that one must fulfill only if puts himself in a situation in which the opportunity for the <em>mitzva</em> presents itself. For example, there is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40632&pgnum=161\" rel=\"nofollow\">a <em>mitzva</em> of writing a bill of divorce (<em>get</em>) when divorcing one's wife</a>. One who does so fulfills a <em>mitzva</em>, God's command. However, divorcing one's wife just so as to have the opportunity to do it via a bill of divorce is no <em>mitzva</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Other <em>mitzvos</em> do not depend on putting oneself in a state of obligation, though they may apply only to certain persons. For example, any father of a firstborn (to his mother) son, no matter what, must do <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40632&pgnum=97\" rel=\"nofollow\">the <em>mitzva</em> of <em>pidyon haben</em></a>, redeeming the son for five silver <em>shekel</em>. The <em>mitzva</em> is not \"if you redeem your son, do so for five silver <em>shekel</em>\": it's \"you must redeem your son for five silver <em>shekel</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>I propose that the <em>Chasam Sofer</em>'s doubt is whether <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40632&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow\">marrying a virgin</a> is of the first sort of <em>mitzva</em> or of the second sort. If it's of the first sort, then a <em>kohen gadol</em> must marry a virgin only if he marries. An already married <em>kohen gadol</em> would be exempt. If the <em>mitzva</em> is of the second sort, however, then any <em>kohen gadol</em> would need to marry a virgin: since (according to the <em>Rambam</em> as cited by the <em>Chasam Sofer</em>) a <em>kohen gadol</em> may not have two wives, he'd need first to divorce his wife.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maybe the question is if there is a mitzvah to be married to a besulah or if he can only fulfill the mitzvah when he actually marries a besulah, so if he was married before he will not have the mitzvah only if he gets divorced and marries a besula while he is a cohen godel.</p>\n\n\n",

(He feels that the card-carrying Reform rabbis of several decades ago, however, did not believe in the sanctity of the Torah being read and thus can't receive an aliyah.) He has another responsum about the prohibition of flattering sinners, where he concludes that giving synagogue honors to a sinner is not an automatic declaration of \"the fact that you do Action X is totally fine by us.\" </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless I think it's within a synagogue's rights to make a statement that certain actions so beyond the pale that they preclude honors.

It's not a halachic thing per se, it's a public-policy thing.) </p>\n\n<p>In your particular example, I suspect there are several reasons why a synagogue may choose to make a statement: the sin is universal for Noahides; its acceptance in both general and traditional-but-not-Orthodox society is relatively new; and it's perceived that sometimes the sinner (or a movement with whom he is perceived as affiliating) may have more of an attitude of \"your religion is wrong so go jump in a lake\", compared to \"eh I don't live up to all the laws.\"</p>\n\n\n",

A (male) mamzer would thus be allowed to father a non-mamzer child this way.</p>\n\n<p>In contemporary times you can't just go out and buy a quasi-Jewish slave woman (at least not legally in the US; and we don't condone breaking the law). One suggestion has been to find a woman interested in converting to Judaism, but instead of going through full conversion, declare it \"conversion to quasi-Jewish slave status\"; many rabbis feel this doesn't work as there is no such thing in our location and age.</p>\n\n<p><em>If</em> a mamzer married a non-Jewish woman, and she and the children then converted, the child(ren) would not be labeled a <em>mamzer</em>, though we generally don't allow a Jewish man to go marry a non-Jewish woman (even if she has plans to later convert). There are rumors that certain rabbis have actually recommended this in certain cases, though.

Obviously everyone should ask their LOR.)</p>\n\n<p>There is a water filter (or purifier) that works in the following way:\nThe water flows into a part where there is some sort of \"chemical\" (in the shape of round white balls) that help to \"clean the water\". The water then pours from there out going through a normal sort of filtering part. If we look at the water is the \"ochel\" (food) and the white balls as the \"pasules\" (not good part) is there a problem of borer in the fact that the water (the \"ochel\" in this case) passes through this filter, \"separating\" it from the white balls (the \"pasoles\" in this case.) Perhaps this is \"borer b'cli\" (separating with a vessel) and would be prohibited on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>I'm pointing this out because it's not a \"normal case\" of using a filter where the water simply passes through a sort of sifting part (which could be muter on Shabbos if a person would drink this water without having used the filter.)

A vessel can only contract impurity if it is made from cloth, sackcloth, leather, bone, wood, metal, or earthenware (Rambam Keilim 1:1, see Leviticus 11:32-33 and Numbers 31:22). Plastic therefore cannot contract impurity, so it can block effectively. The metal of the plane very possibly can contract impurity (depending if \"metal utensils\" means any kind of metal or just the six listed in the verse (gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead)), so it can't block effectively.

In a review of sources, R Ari Zivotofsky writes (<a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_washing_after_leaving_the_washroom/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Misconception</strong>: Upon exiting a bathroom, one should wash by pouring water from a keli (utensil) three times on each hand.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Fact</strong>: There is an obligation to wash after using the bathroom (Shulchan Aruch OC 4:18), but three times is not specified, and <strong>a keli\n  is not required.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Details</strong>: The earliest source for washing upon exiting the bathroom is a mishnah\n  (Yoma 28a) that states that in the Beit Hamikdash there was a rule\n  requiring a Kohen to immerse in the mikvah after he defecated and to\n  sanctify (i.e. wash) his hands and feet with water from the Temple’s\n  laver after he urinated. The mishnah seems to portray this as a\n  rule unique to the Temple. The Talmud (Yoma 29b-30a) explains that the\n  requirement for washing hands and feet is solely for hygienic\n  purposes. Rabbeinu Tam (ibid, Tosafot Yeshanim, s.v. mitzvah) deduces\n  that if a Kohen urinated but his hands remain clean, there is no\n  obligation to wash.</p>\n  \n  <p>All the sources that mention a non-Beit Hamikdash-related washing\n  after the bathroom are post-Talmudic. These sources include the\n  Tashbetz, Kolbo and Mordechai, all of whom are cited by the Beit Yosef\n  (OC 4). Other than cleanliness, there are two reasons discussed for\n  the washing. Similar to washing before davening (OC 92:4), some view\n  it as a preparation for reciting the berachah Asher Yatzar after using\n  the bathroom (see Tur OC 165 and commentaries). Additionally,\n  according to the Mishnah Berurah (4:40; 227:11) and others, merely\n  entering a beit hakisei (an old-fashioned as opposed to a modern\n  bathroom) imposes a ruach ra, which must be removed by washing.\n  However, the mishnah regarding the Temple referred to above presumably\n  refers to a Kohen who took care of his needs in a bathroom and yet\n  the Talmud makes no mention of a ruach ra. Furthermore, many\n  authorities argue that a modern, clean, multi-purpose bathroom does\n  not convey a ruach ra even if an old-fashioned bathroom does.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 7:3) summarizes these sources as follows: If,\n  while using the facilities, one did not touch anything dirty or any\n  part of his body that is normally covered, there is no requirement to\n  wash at all. Nonetheless, the custom is to wash, either because of\n  cleanliness or because it is proper in order to say Asher Yatzar. He\n  observes that some have the custom to wash thrice, but the Beit Yosef\n  does not rule that way. <strong>The Aruch Hashulchan makes no mention of a\n  keli or ruach ra.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>According to those who hold that the washing is for cleanliness or in\n  preparation for Asher Yatzar, there are few ritual requirements.\n  <strong>Similar to the washing prior to davening, such a washing requires\n  neither a keli nor three washings.</strong> According to the Mishnah Berurah\n  (4:38), which holds that the washing is due to a ruach ra, the washing\n  still has fewer rules than other ritual washings — such as for bread — <strong>and\n  does not require a keli</strong> (Mishnah Berurah 165:2). The washing after\n  using the bathroom is more akin to a washing for hygienic reasons,\n  such as is required after removing one’s shoes or cutting one’s hair\n  (SA OC 4:18).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Yalkut Yosef similarly indicates that washing\n  after using the bathroom <strong>does not require a utensil</strong>. This was\n  stated explicitly by Harav Ben Tzion Abba Shaul who reportedly washed from a faucet even when a utensil was\n  readily available, in order to emphasize this point.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Yitzchak Yaakov Weiss observes that while\n  most authorities state that a keli is not required, in deference to\n  the minority opinion, <strong>it is a good idea to use a keli, although he\n  reiterates that it is not required.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>In the yeshivah world washing with a utensil after using the bathroom\n  is a widespread practice, possibly based on the custom of the Chazon\n  Ish as publicized in Ta’ama D’kra. <strong>However, this custom seems to\n  have been a personal stringency of the Chazon Ish and not intended\n  as a halachah for the masses.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the original for more details and sources.</p>\n\n\n",

Must he? Does it matter if he has converted to some other religion such as Christianity? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The halachah is once a Jew, always a Jew. The source most often cited for this is ישראל אף על פי שחטא ישראל הוא (Sanhedrin 44a)--A Jew, even if he has sinned remains a Jew. Rashi in a teshuvah cites this Gemara as the basis for saying that a mumar retains his Jewish status. Thus a Jew cannot lose his obligation to perform mitzvot. The fact that he may lose his status as a Jew <em>in good standing</em> and thus is ineligible to write a sefer Torah or perform shechita is irrelevant to his obligation in mitzvot. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik explained this by reference to the two types of kedushah that a Jew possesses, symbolized by the two blessings, שלא עשני גוי and אשר בחר בנו מכל העמים. One holiness, that of שלא עשני גוי, is a product of being born a Jew (or converting to Judaism). It cannot be renounced. However, there is a second kedushah which comes from observing the Torah, אשר בחר בנו מכל העמים ונתן לנו את תורתו; regarding this element of kedushah, if a Jew does not observe the mitzvot he loses his status (Chumash Mesoras Harav Vayikra, p. 223): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One aspect of our chosenness relates to being the progeny of Abraham,\n  and it is for this aspect which we recite the blessing <em>who has not\n  made me a gentile</em>. A second chosenness comes through the study of\n  Torah, reflected in the blessing <em>who has chosen us from among the\n  nations</em>. This chosenness involves a higher sanctification than is\n  afforded through simple lineage. By understanding the duality of our\n  kedushah, we can explain a puzzling area of Jewish law. The halachic\n  status of a Jew who renounces his religion is complex: although his\n  status as a Jew is compromised, it does not entirely disappear. With\n  regard to specific halachos, an apostate Jew is considered no\n  different from a non-Jew. For example, regarding the slaughter of\n  animals or the writing of Torah scrolls, an apostate is considered to\n  be a non-Jew: his meat would be considered non-kosher, and his Torah\n  scroll would be invalid. On the other hand, if he betroths a woman,\n  his betrothal would be valid. How can we understand the hybrid nature\n  of the halachos concerning an apostate? The apostate Jew retains the\n  sanctity afforded through his lineage—a heritage that cannot be\n  renounced, no matter what he does. This kedushah applies equally to\n  the apostate as it does to the greatest of rabbis. The second\n  kedushah, however, is dependent on the sanctity of the individual\n  attainable only through limud haTorah. The apostate has renounced this\n  second kedushah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As <em>kibud av v'em</em> is one of the five things that a person is rewarded both in <em>olam haba</em> as well as <em>olam hazeh</em> (this world and the next), it is an important concern to contemplate. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if a non-Jew was to ask that person why he wasn't sitting <em>shiva</em>, observing <em>shloshim</em> or saying <em>kaddish</em> and he was to respond that his parent was not Jewish, this could lead to a <em>chillul Hashem</em> (desecration of the name of G-d) which could be detrimental to the Jewish people. </p>\n\n<p>(This is more important when discussing <em>gerim</em> [converts]; if someone converts, <em>halachically</em> their birth parents are no longer their parents, as Avraham Avinu and Sarah take their place. However, resentment can arise if someone was to ask why they weren't sitting <em>shiva</em> and the response is \"they're not Jewish\" or \"under Jewish law, they aren't really my parents anymore.\") </p>\n\n<p>So, there is room to work here. I would say that, in the case of a non-Jewish parent that the child wants to mourn by sitting <em>shivah</em>, there is a sufficient case to be made for allowing it. However, for a child who does not want to mourn, there is no absolute requirement for them to mourn. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My answer to this would be the same as I wrote to an earlier question about whether a convert can say <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3842/may-or-should-a-convert-recite-kaddish-after-his-biological-parents-deaths\">kaddish for his birth-parents</a>, with a minor caveat since you're speaking about an individual who has one parent who is Jewish and another who is not. In the case where the mother is Jewish, there is no question that the child says kaddish and sits shiva for his or her mother since the child is Jewish by birth (assuming that the mother is no longer with the non-Jew and not worshipping in a non-Jewish forum).  </p>\n\n<p>But in the case where the child's father was Jewish and the mother would not, the child would be considered non-Jewish, according to Jewish law, until she or he converted.  Upon conversion, the convert is normally considered like a newborn child and the birth-parents are generally discounted.  Babyl. Talmud Yevamos 97a-98b. Maimonedes (aka Rambam) holds that conversion breaks blood lines for purposes of mourning. Avel 2:3.  So even if a father and his daughter both converted together, she would not sit shiva for him.  Ibid.  Although I haven't found a ruling for the case of a convert with a Jewish father, I would think it would be much the same things.  The conversion has technically broken the father-daughter tie and she would honor her father in other ways, such as reading Psalms, or dedicating time to study Torah in his memory.</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote before, my Rav told me that I could not sit shiva for my parents.  The reasoning is that someone may assume -- based on the convert sitting shiva -- that the deceased parents were Jewish, and then make false assumptions about whether siblings are Jewish, also, and might consider introducing the non-Jewish sibling to a Jewish single for purposes of possibly getting married.  This is a more serious possibility than saying kaddish for a non-Jewish parent because no one would necessarily know for whom you are saying kaddish.  If a convert cannot sit shiva for a  non-Jewish parent because someone might assume the parent was Jewish, then I think it is obvious that a child of a mixed marriage cannot sit shiva for her non-Jewish father.</p>\n\n\n",

Part of it is used for their worship and other activities. However, another part of the building (which is essentially separate) is rented or given out to other organizations/people to use. For a while a Jewish school was using one of the rooms for a play group of young children. They were given this room for free and had no problem going into this part of the building since it was separate from the Church and used for many other things. However, now the Church wants to charge rent, and seemingly the money would be going to the Church.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything wrong with this?</p>\n\n<p>Is this perhaps the same exact case as the one above? The reason it might be different is that, although connected to the church, the room's not literally part of the Church's building, to the extent that to walk into it was no problem. Perhaps the money being paid for the rent can be looked at as if it's going for the building up-keep (and what the Church ultimately decides to do with it wouldn't matter). Many times people might do business with gentiles and the money could go to their causes. Perhaps could rely on the Poskim that Christianity is not Avodah Zarah and therefore not a problem at all (there is much from the Meiri in what he wrote on Shas and in Teshuvas about this topic -- he is quite makil).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It doesn't matter if it's on the premesis or not, it depends on if the money will be used to enhance/repair/beautify Avodah Zoro or just to the people.</p>\n\n<p>When they were using it for free it was no problem but when paying rent it would depend on the above and on the issue of wanting the Avodah Zoro to remain standing. See Shulchan Aruch Yore Dei'ah 143:3 and the Darkei Teshuvah there, also see 148:12.</p>\n\n<p>But asking a rabbi is a must.</p>\n\n\n",

The quote from the Chida follows (Shem ha-Gedolim in his entry for Mar R. Avraham Gaon): </p>\n\n<p>וראה זה חדש שלא מצינו בתנאים שבמשנה והבריתא תנא ששמו אברהם וגם מאמוראים לא מצאתי כעת בס' יוחסין... גם שם יצחק בתנאים שבמשנה לא יש מי ששמו יצחק, אך בבריתא ובזוהר הקדוש יש, ובאמוראים הרבה יש ששמם יצחק, ובשם יעקב יש זכר במשנה ובבריתא והרבה בש\"ס, ומהגאונים ואילך נשתרבבו שמות אברהם יצחק ויעקב בגאונים וברבנים ובכל המון ישראל עד היום הזה. וגם באות מם להלן (עי' רב משה גאון) הבאתי שמצאתי בכ\"י מי שהפליא שלא היה בתנאים ואמוראים מי שנקרא משה עד הגאונים ע\"ש. </p>\n\n<p>In his entry for R. Moshe Gaon, the Chida likewise notes the absence of Tannaim and Amoraim named Moshe (though note the name of Rav Huna's father, משה בר עצרי, mentioned in <em>Arachin</em> 23a). The Chida writes: </p>\n\n<p>מצאתי כתוב בס' כ\"י לא היה שום תנא או אמורא שנקרא משה והוא פלא וסוד. והיינו דאמרי אנשי על הרמב\"ם, ממשה ועד משה וכו' שלא היה תנא או אמורא שנקרא משה, עכ\"ד</p>\n\n<p>The Maharatz Chajes (<em>Gittin</em> 50a) thinks it is merely a coincidence that Chazal didn't mention rabbis with certain famous Biblical names: </p>\n\n<p>בכל זאת לא מצינו בזמן התנאים והאמוראים שהיו נקראים על שם אבותינו...אהרן וגד ואשר דוד ושלמה, ובלא ספק דרק מקרה קרה שלא היו חכמים בזמניהם שיהיו נקראים בשם זה, או שלא היה לחז\"ל לספר מאנשי זמנם אשר היה שמם כן, כמו שמצינו (קידושין ל.) זבולון בן דן תלמיד שמואל, הנה לא מצינו בשום מקום שיהיה איש בזמן התנאים והאמוראים ששמו זבולון או דן רק במקום זה, ובכ\"ז מוכח מכאן דמ\"מ היו נקראים גם בזמנם בשם זה, וצא ולמד גם על שאר שמות שלא נזכרו במשנה ותלמוד אינו בכוונה אלא ע\"פ מקרה. </p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F_%D7%92%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%98%D7%A0%D7%A8\">R. Nosson Gestetner</a>, after citing the Chida, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=936&st=&pgnum=15&hilite=\">suggests</a> that, as with Moshe, the souls of Avraham, Aharon, David, and Shlomo encompass the souls of all Jews and represent the transmission of the Torah in its entirety. Since the rabbis of the Talmud established the foundations of the Oral Law, each of them could deservedly be called by these names (as in the instance of Rav Safra calling Rava the name Moshe). R. Gestetner therefore suggests that, to distinguish the rabbis from one another, none of them were called by these names:  </p>\n\n<p>והנה כתב האריז\"ל, \"כללות כל הנשמות הם ששים רבוא, והתורה היא שורש הנשמות בישראל, ולכן יש כנגדם ששים רבוא פירושים, אשר כפי כל פירוש מן הששים רבוא משם נתהוה שורש נשמה אחת מישראל, ולעתיד לבוא כל אחד ואחד יקרא את התורה כפי הפירוש המגיע לשורשו...ונשמת משה רבינו ע\"ה היתה כוללת כל הששים רבוא, ולכן ידע כל הששים רבוא פירושים\"... ומעתה נראה לומר דגם חכמי המשנה והגמרא שהעמידו את יסודות תורה שבעל פה, כללו בתוכם את נשמת משה רבינו ע\"ה...ולכן מצינו בגמ' (שבת קא:) דאמר ליה רב ספרא לרבא משה שפיר קאמרת...והיינו כי כל חכמי הש\"ס הם בבחינת משה רבינו שכללו את כל התורה כולה, ולכן לא נקראו בשם מיוחד משה כי שם זה לא סגי להבדילם איש מחבירו, דהא כל אחד מהם הוא בבחינת משה, וכולם ביחד הם בבחינת משה רבינו, אבל ניתן להם שם אחר המייחד את כל אחד מחבירו לפי בחינתו...ולפי דרך זה יש לומר גם טעם שלא מצינו בין חכמי המשנה והגמרא שמות של אברהם אבינו ואהרן ודוד ושלמה, כי נשמותיהם היו גם כן נשמות כוללות...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Have the empires of old perished?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember being taught when I was younger that the fact that Jews are around is a testimony to the eternity of our religion; that we survived them all and that they are no longer.</p>\n\n<p>I am unaware (probably in ignorance) of a source in chazal that justifies this teaching. Perhaps the \"v'hee she'amdah\" of the haggadah bares resemblance: \"that which stood for our forefathers and us, that not only one (nation) stood up against us to destroy us. Rather in every generation and generation they stand against us to destroy and Hashem saves us from their hands\".</p>\n\n<p>But is there a more direct source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are many sources dealing with 4 empires collected in a rare book \"Darkness and Destiny: The Four Empires in Midrash and Beyond\" by Michoel Miller. One such sited source is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Vayetzei.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Veyeitzei 2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He (Yaakov) dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth; and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it (Gen. 28:12). R. Samuel the son of Nahman declared: These were the guardian angels of the idolatrous nations. He explained further: This verse teaches us that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Jacob, our father, the guardian angel of Babylon ascending seventy rungs of the ladder and descending, the guardian angel of Media ascending fifty-two rungs of the ladder and descending, the guardian angel of Greece ascending one hundred rungs of the ladder and descending, and the guardian angel of Edom ascending the ladder. Jacob did not know how many rungs of the ladder the guardian angel of Edom mounted, and he therefore cried out in terror: Perhaps Edom will never be compelled to descend. The Holy One, blessed be He, then said to him: Fear thou not, O Jacob, My servant; neither be dismayed, O Israel (Jer. 30:10), for even though you see him ascending unto My throne as though that were possible, I will cast him down, as is said: Though thou wert to rise as high as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord (Obad. 4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, the rungs  equal the number of years these nations dominated Israel before succumbing to their sucessors. There certainly have been  more than 4 empires in history, they are usually connected with these 4, as representing some of the aspects of the 4 empires.</p>\n\n\n",

Then, the same thing happens in the second sentence, but with a bigger dip at the end. Usually the first word is \"if\" and is emphasized heavily.

He suggested three speech patterns that might be derived from Talmudic chant: (1) a kal ve-khoymer or a fortiori construction, (2) a “dramatic pair of alternatives”, and (3) “an exception to a charge or preposterousness” (Weinreich 1956:640). In papers written decades later, Kahan Newman elaborated and developed these ideas (Kahan Newman 1995; 2000). Renaming pattern (2) “Balanced Statements” and (3) Kashes (‘difficulties in the text or situation, or a presupposed negative’), she discovered these three patterns in modern Ashkenazic Talmudic chant, and noted that they have correlates in modern Yiddish intonation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kahan Newman posited a correlation between the cantillation marks in the Geniza [Talmudic] manuscripts and the Talmudic oral chant of Ashkenazic Jews. [...] Using the lists of cantillation marks in the Cairo manuscripts photocopied and presented in a series of printed articles by Yeivin (1960:20, 47–69, 167–178, 207–231), she looked for cantillation marks that correspond to Ashkenazic oral chant patterns in the Midrash, the Mishna, the Jerusalem Talmud, and the Babylonian Talmud. In the Talmudic texts, she claims, markers are simultaneously intonational and pictographic: markers that indicate a rising tone are placed above the line and are rising, while markers that indicate falling tone are placed below the line and are falling. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Kahan Newman conjectures that the Jews of Ashkenaz, remnants of a\n  Palestinian community, settled in Ashkenaz before the Babylonian\n  Talmud became dominant. When, at a later date, the Babylonian Talmud\n  gained ascendancy, the Jews of Ashkenaz kept the chant patterns they\n  had used for the Jerusalem Talmud, even as they switched to the\n  Babylonian Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have not been able to obtain a copy of Newman's paper, but it will certainly be illuminating.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am on the cusp of baby boom and gen-X so we were the last to learn ashekenaz pronunciations.

    "content": "# How much is an ashkenazi kesuba today\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A standard Ashkenazi kesuba is a document no different to a post dated cheque; there is nothing religious or holy about it. It says that the man will pay his wife upon divorce or death the sum of 200 silver German marks (or zekukin). This <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3475/what-is-the-value-of-a-kesuba-marriage-contract\">amounts to</a> 100 lbs in total or 230 grams per mark. This was instituted when the Jews lived in Germany most likely in the times of Tosfos, nearly one thousand years ago. See my comment that unlike RMF it is more likely the French mark which was 244 grams and more than the 100 lbs quoted by RMF. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, everyone who got married in Germany would know exactly what was written there, like today everyone knows what dollars are. Later as the Jews moved eastwards it was considered too much and the women had to agree (reluctantly!) to forgo quite a large part of it, like in Russia where she only ended up with roubles to the value of forty dollars. This in no way means that the amount the man offered changed at all but only that she couldn't collect. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Oruch in CM writes regarding a shtar (document) that if the man does not know what is written there (and you believe him) he does not have to pay it. It gives the example of a Sefardi Kesuba which does not have a standard amount. The Chochmas Shlomo at the side says it depends if he himself signed it or not. A man can sign a paper and let someone else put any limitless amount he fancies, but not witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>Today when not everyone reads this blog and very few people know what the 200 zekukim are, even rabbonim, much less the value of them being 100 lbs of silver, how can a kesuba be kosher?

If someone was fasting (and had taken on to fast for a few days) and wasn't able to make havdallah Motzei Shabbos and when it came \"lyl gimmel\" it was also Rosh HaShanah the Magen Avraham says that the person should make havdallah on one cos and kiddush on another cos (and not to make them on one cos.) The Biur Halacha has a very difficult time with this and says how can someone make the bracha of havdallah and end off \"bein kodesh l'chol\" when it's right now Yom Tov? To say bein kodesh l'kodesh he says one also couldn't say. The biur halacha leaves this din b'tzrich iyun gadol. Were there any other poskim that discussed this Magen Avraham and perhaps offer an explanation or discuss (and possibly answer) the questions of the Biur Halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Dovid Feinstein was asked this question and he answers in the sefer L'Torah V'Horaah pg.28</p>\n\n<p>The person asked what should he say since the Biur Halacha ends with a tzarich iyun.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Dovid answered ,it seems to be reliant on a machlokes Rishonim.Is it a tashlumim or do we say a chyiuv is on him still.He brings the Rosh from perek mi shameisu siman 2 that one who is a onein on motzai shabbas does he say havdsllah or not.The Rosh brings the Ri who says that it is a tashlumim and if he was patur then he doesn't say it,the Rosh is maskim to this.However,he brings the Ram who says he is obligated in havdallah and the Maadnei Yom Tov os 3 holds the time is extended up until the third day and the Mechaber paskens in YD 341:2 that he should make havdallah.In the Mishna Brurah siman 71:1 its mashmah a little that he paskens not to say havdallah even though from the מלבושי שרד its mashmah lav davkah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Dovid then writes ,it seems to me that if it is a tashlumim then its shayich to say Ben Kodesh lchol but if the chiyuv is straight then it should be Ben Kodesh lkodesh and the issur of eating is still on him .The MA writes in 299:17 that it is assur to eat all times until one makes havdallah.It seems to me that is not like the MA ,but what can we do,since the MA paskened this way we have to go like him.</p>\n\n<p>wrote from my phone,please fix mistakes,and read inside.</p>\n\n\n",

However in truth, the consequence of these attitudes is not humility. On the contrary, feelings of nothingness lead to emptiness and insecurity. The person with these thoughts has no drive to achieve and feels unimportant, failing to recognize the significance in the good that he/she does.\n  In fact, false humility leads to arrogance. An insecure person is threatened by the views and perceptions of others, and needs to convince himself and others that he is worthy of approval. False humility brings egocentricity and self absorption.</p>\n  \n  <p>Real humility can only be there together with a healthy sense of self. The humble person is fully aware of who he is. He acknowledges his talents, strengths and weaknesses. The humble individual feels safe with his identity and is confident and secure. On the one hand he recognizes that he has a part to play and that G-d acknowledges the importance of his good deeds. At the same time it is specifically this feeling of inner safety that allows him to: make space for others, understand that his strengths are G-d given and do not make him better than anyone else, feel secure enough with himself to understand another point of view with tolerance and respect, be discreet about his achievements without the need for great publicity..</p>\n  \n  <p>That’s why G-d chose a mountain not a valley.

Up is good and down is bad in the world of vertical corollaries. You have to work to go up but going downward is oh so easy, like sin. So it follows that the torah would \"come down from the mountain\". Judaism has no literal recognition of God as a material being such as could exist on a mountain, as that would be idolatry. However one name of God used early on is El Shaddai, which is shown in extrabiblical semitic to be a \"God of the mount\", or as I prefer to say, \"God of the bluff\". Whether \"mount\" refers to a geographical mountain, a horse or a reproductive activity I can't say. The easiest answer is that it's a bluff.</p>\n\n\n",

If a person davened already friday night then they are obligated in Kiddush m'drabbanan. In such a case the katan could be motzee the gadol since he is also chiyuv m'drabbanan (See there M\"B Sif-Katan 2.) However the Sharei Tzion (b'shem the Derech HaChaim) that if the katan already davened he couldn't be motzei the gadol since the katan is 2 d'rabbanans and the gadol is one.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is in Mishneh Brurah Siman 689 Sif-Katan 6. If someone hears from a katan the megillah they are not yotzee. The M\"B there explains that even though the chiyuv of a katan by megillah is d'rabbnanan (just like the gadol) still there is an additional d'rabbanan in regards to the fact that the obligation on the katan in general in all mitzvos is d'rabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>I had assumed as well that another example would be kiddush by day. Since for a gadol it's d'rabbanan (one) and for a katan it's two (the kiddush itself together with the general chiyuv (however I don't have a written source for it, I think the above examples are enough for now.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, do we also say the one who has 3 d'rabbanans can't be motzei the one that has 2?

    "content": "# Why celebrate Lag Ba'Omer on the 33rd according to the MaHaRIL?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are several different opinions about when the students of Rabbi Akiva died, and which days we mourn for them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41319&pgnum=238\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer HaToda'ah</a> quotes <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44458&st=&pgnum=53\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Maharil</a>, who says that the students of Rabbi Akiva died throughout the 49 days of the Omer, but did not die on days during the \"Holiday Days\" of the Omer. These days are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 7 days of Pesach</li>\n<li>3 Days of Rosh Chodesh</li>\n<li>7 Shabbatot</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you add them up, there are 17 days. If you take away 17 days from 49, you're left with 32 days during which the students died. That's why, according to the Maharil, we celebrate Lag Ba'Omer on the 33rd day, to commemorate that the students only died for 32 days, even if they may have died on Lag Ba'Omer itself.</p>\n\n<p>However, there seems to be a problem with this calculation. One of the days of Shabbat would have also been one of the days of Pesach. If so, the students would have died on 33 of the days, not 32. If so, according to the Maharil, shouldn't we celebrate on the 34th day of the Omer, not the 33rd?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On further thought, I think I have more insight into the Maharil. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=62b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud (Yevamot 62B)</a> says that the students of R' Akiva died between Pesach and Shavuot. It does not say that they died during Sefirat Ha'Omer <em>(although, according to the Maharil, this is what practically happened, since no one died the whole of Pesach)</em>. This is why the Maharil counts all 7 days of Pesach as days when no one died, even though it was part of the time of their dying. </p>\n\n<p>This strengthens the question I have above, since one of the 7 days of Pesach must be Shabbat. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The maharil  starts off saying days when no tachnun is said. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14165&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Mishna Berurah in Biur Halacha (493:3)</a> also quotes this reason. But counts  seven days of pesach although they were in Israel and only started on the second day when we say the omer. And only six shabosos. Three days of rosh chodesh which adds up to 16 which leaves 33 days. Most likely there is a mistake in the maharil.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14268&pgnum=330\" rel=\"nofollow\">The bach</a> really asks your question and gives the above answer although not mentioning the maharil. But the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14423&pgnum=321\" rel=\"nofollow\">kaf hachaim (493:24</a>) brings the bach and says he is referring to the maharil. It appears from the kaf hachaim that he  means there is a mistake in the maharil.</p>\n\n<p>If so, why do we celebrate on the 33rd, of the Omer, and not the 34th? Because of the principle that, when it comes certain things (such as certain aspects of mourning), part of the day is like the whole day. (according to this answer, the mourning is only over after daybreak of the 33rd day of the Omer, not the night before).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the footnote to <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/05-03-02/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this artice</a>, the calculation of dates where death did not happen includes Isru Chag (the day after Pesach). This brings the total of \"non-death days\" back to 17, and solves our \"off by one\" problem. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45975&st=&pgnum=440\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nachlat Tzvi on Orach Chaim 493</a> gives this as an answer to our question on the Maharil. Note that he explicitly dismisses the suggestion that we should count 8 days of Pesach, since the students of Rabbi Akiva lived in Israel, where they only observed 7 days.</p>\n\n\n",

To quote the conclusion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The question is on Shabbat, where everyone must be connected to the lechem mishneh and wait to receive a piece (ibid.). We find that on Shabbat it is best to cut off a big enough piece in the beginning to suffice for the whole meal (ibid. 274:2). However, there does not seem to be a requirement for individuals to eat specifically a k’zayit from the lechem mishneh. (A person should eat a k’zayit of bread for it to be a meal and recite Birkat Hamazon and a k’beitza to justify the beracha on netilat yadayim.) However, being connected to the lechem mishneh and the beracha made on it can be accomplished with eating any quantity (Igrot Moshe, OC V, 16; Teshuvot V’hanhagot II, 171).\n  This being said, there are sources that indicate that a piece less than a half of a k’zayit is not considered significant (see Eliya Rabba 174:2) and that one should show respect to the bread to which the mitzva is related (see Levush, OC 174:14). Therefore, people would do well to eat a half of a k’zayit (without exaggerating the size of k’zayit as many of us do on Pesach) from the lechem mishneh. However, one who dislikes the challa the host used for lechem mishneh or has health concerns with it can follow the basic halacha that he can go on to other bread after a small taste from the lechem mishneh. Similarly, hosts who make Hamotzi on a loaf that may not provide a k’zayit or even a half for all (e.g., with large groups or for those who use rolls or matza for lechem mishneh at seuda shlishit and then serve sliced bread or leftovers) need not feel guilty. One who is careful to provide a k’zayit to each guest from the lechem mishneh is praiseworthy (see Shemirat Shabbat K’hilchata 55:24 and footnote 15).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>Shemiras Shabbos K'Hilchoso</em> (52:15) writes that essentially they do not need to eat at all from the <em>Lechem Mishneh</em>, as the host making a blessing and eating from the <em>Lechem Mishneh</em> is sufficient, however because of \"<em>Chibuv Mitzvah</em>\", it is best that they should eat from the <em>Lechem Mishneh</em>, however that only requires a minimal amount, even less than a <em>K'zayis</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that R' Moshe Feinstein (quoted by the <em>Shemiras Shabbos K'Hilchoso, ibid.</em>) held that they are all required to eat a <em>K'zayis</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(<em><a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/13507\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></em>)</p>\n\n\n",

I found the root צְלָא meaning \"pray\" with explanation:\n\"Aramaic, probably corresponding to צָלַע [tsala` ] in the sense of bowing\".\nCome to think of it, there is a lot of construct in this prayer that doesn't coincide with biblical hebrew. Is the entire prayer in Aramaic? Is there any commentary on these obscure words?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The entire prayer, except for the last line, is in Aramaic.</p>\n\n<p>צלי, צלא, or צלו are different constructs of the word meaning \"pray\". צלותהון means \"their prayers\".</p>\n\n<p>As for the root, I believe it is likely correct that it is צלא, though a part of me wants to go digging in my old Aramaic text books to rule out the possibility that it is צלי.</p>\n\n<p>I have never heard it suggested that it comes from a lost guttural (צלע), so I would like to see the source that you read about that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The root of the word is צלי, which means \"to turn\" or \"incline\", and which has the sense of \"pray\" in many passages. For the former, see the Targum on Psalm 102:12 (where it corresponds to the Hebrew word of root נטה), and for the latter see Targum Onkelos on Genesis 12:8 (where it corresponds to the Hebrew word of root קרא). When it means \"pray\", it is always in the pael - which is an Aramaic stem that roughly corresponds to the Hebrew piel.</p>\n\n<p>As a noun, however, it appears in Old Aramaic as צלו, and in Late Aramaic as צלותא, the latter being with the addition of the definite article for a feminine noun. You can find that word in Onkelos on Genesis 18:22, for example, where it describes Abraham occupying himself \"in prayer\" before God (with no corresponding Hebrew expression). The plural, צליין (or צלותיא, with the definite article) can be found in the Targum on Psalm 72:20, in which it corresponds to the Hebrew תפלות.</p>\n\n<p>The word צלותהון comprises the singular noun, \"prayer\", plus a 3rd person masculine plural suffix (הון-), meaning \"their prayer\". The verb that appears before it in your nusach (תתקבל) is a 3rd person singular feminine imperfective: \"may their prayer be received\". I understand that it is usually translated in the plural (\"may their prayers be received\"), but while this would probably require the noun to appear as צלוותהון or צלייתהון (I'm not sure if these forms are attested), it would certainly require the verb to appear as תתקבלן, with a final <em>nun</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>צְלוֹתְהוֹן means praying in Aramic. Many other words of Kadish are also Aramic.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What God must gentiles believe in?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <em>Rambam</em>'s <em>Mishne Tora</em>, the end of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e508.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow\">chapter 8 of <em>M'lachim</em></a> reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Any [gentile] who accepts seven commands and is careful to fulfill them is among the pious of the nations of the world and has a share in the world to come. But that's provided he accepts them and does them because God commanded them in the Torah and informed us through our leader <em>Moshe</em> that descendants of <em>Noach</em> had been commanded them. If, on the other hand, he does them because of the force of logic, he is… not one of the pious of the nations of the world, but one of their wise men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, Jews must — again, I'll quote <em>Mishne Tora</em>, this time from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Y'sode Hatora</em> chapter 1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>know there is a first existing thing who brings all that exists into existence.…<p>And if one could conceive that all other things in existence, except him, would not exist, then he alone would exist: he would not be nonexistent due to their nonexistence, for all existing things require him but he does not require them or any one of them. Thus, his truth is not the truth of any one of them:… there is no truly existing thing besides him like him.…<p>And he guides the wheel with infinite strength, with unending strength….<p>And this god is… not one like a type that includes many individuals, and not one like a body that has many divisions and extents, but a oneness like no other.…<p>It's clear in the Torah and the books of the prophets that God is no body….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We seem to have a few aspects of God that <em>Rambam</em> holds necessary for Jews to believe (or know): that he exists, that he creates every other existence, that his existence is true whereas others' is dependent on his, that he guides all events, that he is indivisible, and that he is incorporeal.</p>\n\n<p>Which of these beliefs, according to <em>Rambam</em>,  are required of gentiles in order to be considered \"among the pious of the nations of the world and [to have] a share in the world to come\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish (Y.D. 62:20) writes that in all likelihood, Noahides are commanded against heresy, because belief in God is the foundation for all 7 commandments that they are actually commanded in. However, he himself is unsure whether this heresy is defined in the same way as it would be for a Jew, considering that there are <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">some authorities who permit Noahides to believe in other gods in addition to God</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer_Twersky\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Mayer Twersky</a> published <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/735004/Rabbi_Mayer_E-_Twersky/--_---_--_-----_-----_-----_--_--\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article on the topic of what Noahides must believe in</a>. The Rambam writes (Hil. Yesodei HaTorah 1:7) that, not only must one believe that God is One, eternal, and incorporeal, but that these three factors are dependent on one another. Thus, R. Twersky writes, just like the Jews must believe that the creator and source of all that exists is one, eternal, and incorporeal, so too a gentile who doesn't believe in this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18628/is-it-permitted-for-a-ben-noach-be-an-atheist/48957#48957\">doesn't believe in God</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam doesn't specifically write that one must believe that God created the world from nothing, though this does appear in the corrected version of his 13 foundational beliefs listed in his introduction to Perek Cheilek. However, R. Yaakov Kamenetsky writes in several places (Emes L'Yaakov to Beraishis 8:22, Shemos 20:10) that although non-Jews <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18628/is-it-permitted-for-a-ben-noach-be-an-atheist/48957#48957\">do need to believe in God</a>, they are not obligated to believe that God <em>created</em> the world, merely that He is the cause of the world's existence. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Twersky, however, goes a step further than requiring Noahides to believe in the same God as the Jewish people: in the aforementioned article, he writes that according to the Rambam, a Noahide needs to believe in the divinity of the Torah as well as all other 13 principles in order to be given a share in the afterlife. He proves this from the fact that, in his listing of the beliefs that would cause one to be barred from the world to come, (Hil. Teshuvah 3:5-8), he writes that Christians and 'Hagarites' (Muslims, I believe) are heretics, because they believe that the Torah has been superseded by another book or prophecy. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First it should be noted that the 7 Noahide laws themselves do not say anything about necessitating a belief in God. As summarized by <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/seven-laws-of-noah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article on Simple to Remember</a> The relevant law is #4, namely it is forbidden to worship idols.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However the whole area of relations between humanity and its Creator has been placed under specific requirements, namely that only His truth and unity should be the subject of belief, worship and philosophy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you already explained, Rambam says that a belief in a single God, and a belief that this God commended the 7 Noahide laws, are a prerequisite, but he doesn't clearly say how detailed or accurate their understanding of God must be besides that.</p>\n\n<p>There is a good book on the topic, The Path of the Righteous Gentile: An Introduction to the Seven Laws of the Children of Noah by Chaim Clorfene and Yaakov Rogalsky, that covers the issue. <a href=\"http://noahide-ancient-path.co.uk/index.php/judaism-articles/2011/05/the-path-of-the-righteous-gentile/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here appears to be an online version of the book, but I can't vouch for the website.</a> I couldn't find where he explicitly mentions this, but the feeling I got from it is that a gentile should simply believe in the God of the Torah. In Chapter 4 he describes various things that one \"must realize\" or \"should contemplate\" that basically explain the understanding of the omnipotence, mercy, and other qualities of God.</p>\n\n<p>In Chapter 6 of the book, he details the laws against idolatry. In the beginning there, he explains that just by avoiding idolatry, he demonstrates belief in God.</p>\n\n\n",

We know that Beit Shammai had a bunch of rulings regarding Tumah/uncleanliness of gentiles, etc.  We've also got the story of Zecharia ben Avkulus (Gittin 56b), which connects the rejection of a roman korban with the destruction of the temple.  The compilation of something like Megilat Taanit might very well be something a zealot might be inclined to write as proof of hashem's purpose.  Thus, if R.

The toilets are due east (and lead directly from the hall where davening occurs), which means that people pray towards the toilets rather than the Aron. Although clearly not an ideal situation, what is the ideal in this scenario?

Harsh as it is it seems in the case of a rape the marriage must end.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>As I understand it, if a Kohen is certain that his wife was violated by another man, their union is now prohibited and a divorce would be needed. A kohen is prohibited from being married to an <em>isha zonah</em>, which the Talmud defines as a woman who has had relations with any man -- regardless of her choice in the matter! -- other than her husband, with the exception of premarital relations with a Jew (which does not disqualify a woman from marrying a kohen). Thus if a married woman is raped, her rapist is \"another man\", and she can't go home to her kohen husband. (If the husband is not a kohen, the couple is prohibited from reuniting only if she chose to \"betray\" her husband, <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=5#C2838\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not if she was raped</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Aaron Rothkoff-Rakeffet tells of a tragic such case years ago in Philadelphia, if I recall correctly, where she was raped on the way to/from the mikvah, which was still located in the older, sketchier part of town; as her husband was a Kohen, a divorce was needed. May God have mercy.</p>\n\n<p>I think there may be some discussion about what constitutes \"certainty\" on the husband's part, or if he could try to argue he doesn't believe it really happened or the like -- but that only goes so far. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/28312/21\">Nagah quoted</a> a fascinating responsum of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (EH I:24):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even if the wife was incredibly modest and had no business with other men and there was no conflict in their marriage, they were always peacefully in love -- perhaps she wanted to leave her husband and marry another man for whatever reason. Therefore [the husband's] saying that he believes [his wife was raped] is worthless; we must tell the husband \"your belief is mistaken\", he must put those thoughts aside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can tell me I've watched too much <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">L&O:SVU</a>, but it really bothers me to say \"oh she was making up a rape allegation\"; I really wonder how far you can take that. Let's say they're able to arrest and convict the rapist with strong evidence? Do we still say nothing happened? </p>\n\n<p>There may be other halachic loopholes of which I'm unaware, but generally speaking yes, this is a really awful tragedy. (Also be aware that the halachic definition of violation here is quite specific; it's certainly possible she was sexually abused in a different way, which would get us out of this problem.)</p>\n\n<p>Years ago there was a nominally-affiliated Jewish man who met a non-Jewish woman interested in spiritual growth; eventually they reached full observance, she was preparing for conversion to Judaism, and plans for marriage were made. Then it was discovered that he was a Kohen (<em>note</em>: the \"duchening hands\" picture on a tombstone may not establish sufficient proof of Kohen status, that may just have been \"stock Hebrew icon #3A\" from a catalog that someone selected). Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik observed that there is no good way we can try to explain this; we simply say that when the rubber meets the road we are obligated to submit to the will of a G-d whose ways we don't always understand, and each of them will have to pick up the pieces of their lives and try to find someone else. (I've heard others try to say \"explain to them about what a precious thing <em>kehuna</em> is to us; I guess if that floats your boat, fine.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't think you can offer a better explanation here. We have a system of laws that we believe were given by G-d, and we abide by them without exception. Generally, doing so can lead to personal fulfilment and wellbeing, but ultimately it is not ourselves -- nor our sense of \"fairness\" -- that we worship. (Rabbi Soloveichik observed that Father Abraham was prepared to carry out the child sacrifice of his son, though that would have meant his life's mission of spreading ethical monotheism would have been seen as a failure -- because the will of G-d, not our own \"personal fulfilment\" -- is the be-all, end-all. This is a difficult message for a generation focused on \"this is good for me.\") </p>\n\n<p>Tragic cases like this one prove that religion is about more than just ourselves; we pray never to be put to the test like that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>It is important to note that the husband must \"believe\" his wife in order for them to need a divorce. </p>\n\n<p>There is a very pertinent <em>teshuva</em> from R' Moshe Feinstein (אגרות משה אה\"ע א' סימן כ\"ד) in which he writes that the criteria for \"belief\" is different from what one may imagine. In essence, according to him, even if a husband says he believes his wife, we don't accept his belief except under extremely limited circumstances. Essentially we say that since חז\"ל said a husband is not obligated to believe his wife, for she may have her eyes on someone else (i.e., she is fabricating the story to get divorced and marry someone else) this person who does believe her is no smarter than חז\"ל and his belief is misplaced.</p>\n\n<p>Based on R' Moshe, in almost all cases the husband would not be required to divorce his wife.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה יש לע\"ד עוד דבר חדש שאני סובר שהוא דבר פשוט, דפירוש שהבעל מאמינה שהמחבר בסימן קט\"ו סעיף ו' סובר שחייב להוציאה וכן מסיק הרמ\"א בסימן קע\"ח סעיף ט' שכתב אבל יש חולקין וסבירא להו דאף בזה\"ז נאמן, אינו בסתם אמירה מסברתו שלא היתה משקרת לומר דבר גנאי על עצמה וכדומה מטעמים קלושים כגון שיאמר שידוע שהיא רוצה בו ולא באיש אחר או שיודע שהיא אשה צנועה, דהרי דברים אלו ראו חכמים דמשנה אחרונה שאינם טעמים נכונים ואיך שייך שהוא יאמר שחולק על החכמים דמשנה אחרונה מאיזה מהטעמים קלושים שמחזיק שאומרת אמת דודאי הוא הבל דהם יודעים יותר מכל העולם שיש לחשוד אף להצנועה ואף להמסורה לבעלה ולא היה שום קטטא בינייהו והיו שרויין כל העת בשלום ובאהבה, שאולי משקרת מחמת שנתנה עיניה באחר ואף באשה שקיימה בנפשה כל כבודה בת מלך פנימה ולא היה לה שום מגע ומשא עם אנשים אחרים נמי אמרו שיש לחוש שרוצה לצאת מבעלה ולהנשא לאחר מאיזה טעם, <strong>ולכן אמירתו שמאמין לה אינו כלום וצריכין לומר להבעל שמה שאתה אומר שאתה מאמין לה מאחד מהטעמים אמרו חכמים שהוא טעות בידך ומוכרח לבטל דעתו.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But that would seem to be a concern any time the dairy food is liquidy while baking (once the oven is hot), whether it is liquidy when put into the oven, when removed, or any time in between. Why does the Star-K specify that the <strong>finished product</strong> must be dry?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5771/shavuos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Weekly Halacha column</a> by <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/blog/an-interview-with-rabbi-doniel-neustadt-author-of-the-monthly-halachic-discussion\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Doniel Neustadt</a>, the problem with steam is that the steam from the second dish will rise up, absorb flavor that the first dish had deposited into the oven walls, <strong>and then condense and fall back into the second dish,</strong> thus adding flavor from the first dish to the second dish. R' Neustadt records a disagreement between the authorities regarding whether the steam making deposits to and withdrawals from the oven walls is plausible in the first place:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>According to She’alas Ya’avets, et al., steam dries up and evaporates in a hot oven before it reaches the walls, so the steam concern does not apply to hot ovens, and (as long as they're kept clean), they can be used serially for meat and milk dishes.</p></li>\n<li><p>According to Igros Moshe, et al., we can't be so sure that the steam evaporates before interacting with the walls, so this concern does apply. However, Igros Moshe qualifies this concern by saying that if the heating element of the oven is on top, then we can be sure that the steam will disappear before contacting the walls of the oven.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how to understand this concept of steam \"drying up\" and \"evaporating,\" since steam is the product of evaporation. If I'm not mistaken, for the steam (and its flavor cargo) to disappear without interacting with the oven walls, it would have to be physically vented. Perhaps that mechanism is, indeed part of the consideration.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, it's clear that the authorities take into account the possibility that the heat of the oven will prevent the steam from reaching the walls in the first place. Therefore, perhaps this ruling about dishes that come out dry from the Star-K extends that concept to the condensation and return to food process using two additional mitigating factors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For steam to condense and fall back into food, it would generally have to cool down, which is less probable in an oven that's hot enough to make it rise in the first place.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the dish starts off dry, then we assume that it's not emitting [significant] steam to begin with, so the steam process won't affect it. <strong>If it starts off wet and ends dry, then presumably, any steam that it emits is disappearing above, since it has experienced a significant loss of liquid.</strong> So, we can assume that the steam didn't get a chance to return to the dish bearing foreign flavor from the oven walls.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>I'm still waiting for a response to my email to the Star-K.

Why is this?  Was it simply because he had no children? If so, why was nobody else appointed to be the rebbe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>There are, perhaps, several factors to consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Chabad thought, the rebbe is more than just a leader, Torah teacher, spiritual guide, etc. All of these roles, and many more, are outgrowths and expressions of his being the נשמה כללית, the \"all-encompassing soul\" of the Jewish people (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tanya, ch. 2</a>).</p>\n<p>Now, of course, barring an explicit statement by Chabad rebbe A that potential successor B has a נשמה כללית, there's really no way to know who's the bearer of one. But by and large throughout Chabad history, the successor was essentially \"voted in\" - often against his will - by consensus of the elder chassidim, which in retrospect means that they had Divine assistance in determining who that person should be. If, then, there has been no movement in that direction, then that may well indicate that there simply is no one suitable. (What deeper reasons there might be for Hashem to cause things to be this way? Perhaps the one indicated in Josh's answer, or perhaps others; אין לי עסק בנסתרות - I have no business with hidden matters.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On a more down-to-earth level, the dynastic principle is very strongly embedded in Chabad history: in the \"main line\" of succession, every rebbe since R. Schneur Zalman has been his predecessor's son or son-in-law. (This is also true of the Chabad dynasties that branched off from the Tzemach Tzedek's second through fourth sons.) The groups that instead followed a disciple from outside the family (R. Aharon of Strashelye, R. Avraham Dovber Levine) were, then as now, considered schismatic. Practically speaking, then, with the Rebbe having been childless and his other brothers-in-law (the Previous Rebbe had no sons) having passed away before him, there is no one who would meet that criterion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To address Shalom's point about plans and foresight: במחילת כבודו, that I think the premise of his answer is a bit mistaken. There were actually very few cases where the Lubavitcher rebbeim designated their successors (even when there were multiple possible candidates); in fact I don't believe any of them ever explicitly said, \"X should be the next rebbe.\" The closest are the Tzemach Tzedek directing the Maharash to start delivering original maamarim (winter 5626, a few months before his own passing), and the Rashab similarly directing the Rayatz in his will to say Chassidus publicly. (The latter case was during the upheaval following the Russian revolution, which obviously was a situation where no uncertainty could be tolerated - and even then the Rayatz was reluctant to fully accept the position until, as in point 1, he was pressed into it by the chassidim. As for the Tzemach Tzedek, that his directive wasn't seen as necessarily designating a successor is proven by the simple fact that three of his other sons also accepted positions as Chabad rebbeim, albeit in other towns.)</p>\n<p>Of course, each of the rebbeim can be seen in retrospect to have groomed their successors for the position, but much of that was by assigning them responsibilities - which they did to their other sons, sons-in-law and other people close to them as well, so that's hardly dispositive. [Consider the Previous Rebbe: he appointed his oldest son-in-law the Rashag as director of Tomchei Tmimim, and his second son-in-law the Ramash (the Rebbe) as director of Merkos, Machaneh Yisroel and Kehot (his third son-in-law R. Mendel Horenstein was killed in the Holocaust) - but in addition there were responsibilities parceled out to many others as well, such as R. Nissan Mindel, R. Chaim Mordechai Aizik Hodakov, etc. When the Previous Rebbe passed away, then, there was a minority of chassidim who held out for the Rashag, a majority for the Ramash, and so far as I know no one considered anyone else as even a possibility.]</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>(I suspect this will get some downvotes or be seen as disrespectful by some.

Rumor has it that some believed it had been decreed long ago that there would only be seven grand rabbis of Lubavitch, and hopes were high that the Messiah would come at that point.

What has Mesha achieved in killing his son? He was not commanded to do so by God, in fact it violates one of the 7 noachide laws. This is equally true if he killed the son of the Edomite king.

Mesha had asked his advisers why the G'd of the Jews always helps them. His advisers told him that it came as a result of their ancestor Abraham being prepared to slaughter his son to H'. Mesha decided to do so too in order to please G'd, or according to another opinion in the gemoro, to please his god. Although he was totally wrong in doing this, his act did bring about a great anger against the Israelites (as per pasuk 27) because they were serving idols and, unlike Mesha, were not interested in pleasing G'd. In reality this anger could have had catastrophic consequences  for the Israelites but they were saved, say Chazal, in the merit of the righteous lady mentioned in the next chapter. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is brought in <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/tanhuma/24.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midrash Tanchuma Vayikra.

Rav and Shmuel engage in a dispute concerning this. One says: The king sacrificed his son for the sake of Heaven, and one says: The king sacrificed his son for the sake of idol worship. The Gemara asks: Granted, according to the one who says that he sacrificed him for the sake of Heaven, this is as it is written: “And there was great indignation against Israel,” as the gentile attempted to honor God according to his understanding, while the Jewish people were straying from worshipping God, leading to God’s anger against them. But according to the one who says that he sacrificed him for the sake of idol worship, why would the verse state: “And there was…indignation”? The Gemara answers: This can be understood in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction: It is written concerning the Jewish people: “You have not walked in My statutes, neither have you kept My ordinances; nor have you done according to the statutes of the nations that are round about you” (Ezekiel 5:7), and it is also written: “You have done according to the statutes of the nations that are round about you” (Ezekiel 11:12). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explains: You did not act like the proper ones among the nations, but you did act like the flawed ones among them. Here as well, the Jewish people learned from the king of Moab to engage in human sacrifice. The Gemara discusses the end of that verse: “And they departed from him and returned to their own land [la’aretz]” (II Kings 3:27). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: At that time the enemies of the Jewish people, a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, descended to the lowest level. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To extrapolate (and add my own interpretation) verses 18-19 were in fact fulfilled, Moab was given into the hands of the Jewish army and that army did fell the trees and stop up the water. There is no indication that Moab was militarily successful again Yisrael in this war. However, the prophecy did not state that Moab would be completely wiped out. Once Mesha performed this sacrifice it either provided him with more merit, even though it was perhaps not what God 'wanted' the intention behind it was noble. Or, it cast the merit of Yisrael in doubt. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps in this situation we can apply the concept of <a href=\"http://asif.co.il/?wpfb_dl=3471\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שמא יגרום החטא</a> that even though there was a positive prophecy it need not come true in the most positive possible way. </p>\n\n\n",

Until recently<sup>1</sup>, the US Justice Department was still considering what policy to approach in such a discrepancy, which revolves around the <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-tenth-amendment-to-the-us-constitution.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ambiguously implied exo-constitutional powers</a> stipulated in the 10th amendment<sup>2</sup>. </p>\n\n<p>All of this makes me wonder about what the halacha would say. Disregarding the halachic issue of drug use, is it permissible to do something that's legalized in your state but illegal federally? What does the halacha say about state/federal conflicts of laws?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not so familiar with current American state laws, otherwise I would have picked an example that is only halachically problematic because of its dina d'malcuta dina issue (and as has been <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10611/1865\">answered previously</a>, the issues of marijuana are broader than that).  <br/></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub> 1.

Article VI Clause 2 reads</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that the laws of the states are overruled by federal laws. As I mentioned in a comment above, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution only discusses what the federal government may legislate in the first place, and says nothing about conflicting state and national laws.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of marijuana, this means that its nation-wide ban overrules the legality within states, and the \"law of the land\" is that it is illegal. In fact, the FBI has even raided a few marijuana dispensaries in those states where it is \"legalized\" for various reasons. The national government has decided that marijuana enforcement will have a low priority; however, it is still illegal all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the rules of <em>Dina Demalchuta</em> alone are enough to prohibit the smoking of marijuana in the United States. And in general, <strong>for the purpose of determining what the Dina Demalchuta is when state law contradicts federal law, federal law is the law of the land.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First off: halacha still prohibits marijuana, for all sorts of other reasons! What follows here is a theoretical discussion of <em>dina demalchusa</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One limitation is that the law must be \"that of the kingdom\", not just the whims of a particular king. If a law is completely bizarre and a total departure from anything ever enacted before, that can't be called \"the law of the kingdom.\" I think the prohibition on marijuana is accepted enough that it is the \"law of the kingdom\", yet my suspicion is that legalization is not considered too out-there and bizarre either.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam (based on consensus developed by the Gaonim) rules (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/b305.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">end of Laws of Theft & Loss, Ch. 5</a>) that if you're not sure which government is actually ruling at this moment in time (e.g. various warlords are jockeying for power), we determine government <em>de facto</em> as the one whose currency people actually use. I wonder how that would play into the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Probably the most relevant question here -- and I'm dodging your actual question of state-vs.-federal -- is if a law is on the books but not seriously enforced, is that covered by <em>dina demalchusa dina</em>? The Gemara discusses taxes and drafts, which governments take quite seriously. Rabbi Aharon Soloveichik zt'l was of the opinion that <em>dina demalchusa</em> prohibits one to make a rolling stop through a stop sign at 3AM with no cars anywhere in sight; other rabbis are of the opinion that it only applies to things the state actually prosecutes or cares about. (Though as one teacher put it, \"there's a daf yomi chaburah at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Otisville\" rel=\"nofollow\">Correctional Institution in Otisville</a> made up of people who all thought that too.\")  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is the first issue of whether secular laws of the United States or any of its state or localities are recognized under dina demalchusa dina, and if so, what categories of laws are recognized and which are not.  As that question has been posed elsewhere, I'm going to not discuss it now, but note that there is a dispute regarding the view of the Aruch HaShulchan who supposedly implied that the laws of a democracy, such as England, would be recognized as being applicable.  Since the Aruch HaShulchan also included \"Mother Russia\" as an example of equitable laws, many rabbis have questioned whether the opinion was that of the Russian censors.  Rabbi Yitzhok Breitowitz, however, has suggested that if that were true, then England would never have been mentioned in the text -- he speculates that the Aruch HaShulchan, himself, mentioned Russia precisely not to irritate Russian censors but that implicitly, he was only talking about Democratic government such as England.  Based on that, I'm assuming that all types of Federal, State, and local laws and regulations come under the title of dina demalchusa dina.</p>\n\n<p>Now regarding the secular law -- welcome to the new era of the resurrection of the 10th Amendment brought to us thanks to Justice Scalia.  You are going to have to look at jurisdiction to indicate which laws apply.  If the drug was manufactured in one state and transported to another state, either at farm-, wholesale- or retail-levels, then Federal Law is going to apply as Congress has the right to regulate interstate commerce.  So, the Feds arguably have no jurisdiction if the  marijuana was grown, bought and consumed within the state.  I have no clue how the District of Columbia is going to be able to effect its recent vote to legalize recrational use of marijuana for that reason. If you ask whether you can buy marijuana in Colorado or Washington when it was grown out of state, I would think that the retail purchaser is off the hook, but the wholesale distributors and the retailer sellers could have problems with the Feds.  As I am not licensed to practice law in Colorado or Washington, I have to advise that I am not presenting a legal opinion or offering legal advice, and you rely on these thoughts about the academic issue, at your peril.  </p>\n\n\n",

According to Spinoza, the end of Jewish sovereignty made the law of Judaism irrelevant. The Torah was given before the people entered the land because Spinoza is wrong--the Jewish people are bound by the Torah even in exile. </p>\n\n<p>Michael Wyschogrod in his <em>Body of Faith</em> expands on this idea as follows: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he national identities of other nations are land-bound identities.\n  The nation is defined by the territory it occupies. But [the Jewish\n  nation] comes into national existence before it occupies the land. It\n  becomes a nation on the basis of a promise delivered to it when it is\n  a stranger in the land of others. This awareness of being a stranger\n  is burned into Jewish consciousness. The God of Israel is not a God\n  whose jurisdiction is defined by territorial boundaries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/parsha/rabbi-sacks-on-parsha/law-as-love/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Jonathan Sacks</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was in the desert that the Israelites made a covenant with God and received the Torah, their constitution as a nation under the sovereignty of God. It is the desert that provides the setting for four of the five books of the Torah, and it was there that the Israelites experienced their most intimate contact with God, who sent them water from a rock, manna from heaven and surrounded them with clouds of glory.</p>\n  \n  <p>What story is being told here? The Torah is telling us three things\n  fundamental to Jewish identity. First is the unique phenomenon that in\n  Judaism the law preceded the land. For every other nation in history\n  the reverse was the case. First came the land, then human settlements,\n  first in small groups, then in villages, towns and cities. Then came\n  forms of order and governance and a legal system: first the land, then\n  the law.</p>\n  \n  <p>The fact that in Judaism the Torah was given bemidbar, in the desert,\n  before they had even entered the land, meant that uniquely Jews and\n  Judaism were able to survive, their identity intact, even in exile.\n  Because the law came before the land, even when Jews lost the land\n  they still had the law. This meant that even in exile, Jews were still\n  a nation. God remained their sovereign. The covenant was still in\n  place. Even without a geography, they had an ongoing history. Even\n  before they entered the land, Jews had been given the ability to\n  survive outside the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somewhat relatedly, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, <em>Abraham's Journey</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We emerged as a people from the sand dunes of the Sinai Desert where\n  we wandered for forty years. Why could we not rise as a people in our\n  own land, in prosperity and abundance? the answer is simple. If our\n  morality was to be one of kindness and <em>hesed</em>, it could not have been\n  formulated for people who knew not what suffering is. Only people in\n  exile could understand and appreciate a morality of kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara meant a case where the parent was saying \"Joe is getting on a plane to Japan in an hour and never coming back and will be unreachable forever, but I really really want you to spend the next hour cooking me dinner.\" Cooking your father dinner is generally within the requirements of honoring him, but not in this case as it conflicts with the mitzva of returning lost objects. </p>\n\n<p>Maharik (responsum 166, though numbered differently in some editions) rules similarly, that among the reasons why a parent can't veto their child's choice of spouse is that \"don't marry her\" is arbitrary, not \"honor me\" per se.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Willig (yutorah mp3) says personally he's a \"maximalist\"; Rabbi Hershel Schachter (another yutorah mp3) has stated he finds all three of Maharik's arguments (the above plus two others) to be binding, which thus makes him a \"minimalist.\"</p>\n\n<p>The other huge issue is that even maximalists only go so far. The Gemara says you must feed your parent, but it comes out of your parents' funds, not yours. The parent can't keep demanding money. Thus Rabbi Willig explains the child must accommodate only \"reasonable\" requests. How to define reasonable, well ... good question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112326/jewish/Rabbi-Ishmael-Ben-Elisha.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the following story</a> about R' Yishmael ben Elisha may answer your question (This is a translation of story told in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/28351/603\">a couple places in the Talmud Yerushalmi</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Ishmael's mother was a very pious woman, and she worshipped her son.

Thus, if your mother tells you that it's cold outside and that you must wear a sweater, then you must wear a sweater as long as you are within sight. However, once you are out of sight, and if she won't find out you didn't, there is no requirement to wear the sweater. (Wearing overclothes was actually the example used in the lecture.) The other command, to honor one's parents (<em>kibud</em>), means to do things for them, like feed them. This is whether they will know you did it or not, but wearing a sweater, or any other action that doesn't benefit them, is not included.</p>\n\n<p>But consult your own rabbi for practical advice.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Were there restrictions on marrying members of other tribes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In ancient Israel, when there were clear differences between members of different tribes, were there restrictions on members of one tribe marrying a members of another tribe?</p>\n\n<p>If yes, what would happen to those that did do this?</p>\n\n<p>If not, what would happen if members of different tribes married? Would the wife just become a member of her new husband's tribe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Basically a member of any tribe could marry any other tribe; tribal identity is passed through the father. If Susan, an Asher-ite, marries Bob, a Levite, their children are Levites. (You'd probably still identify Susan herself as being from the tribe of Asher, but it doesn't affect that much. E.g. we're told that Samson's father was from Dan, but his mother from Judah.)</p>\n\n<p>This is still relevant today as some Jews have special status as Levites, and a subset of them are Kohens. Some think it's more prestigious for a kohen to marry a woman from a kohen family, but this is clearly not required. (The Talmud says the kohen gadol -- high priest -- could just as easily have a non-kohen mother.) Marriages between Levites and non-Levites happen all the time. (The average non-Levite today is most likely descended from Judah, given the population numbers, but it's kind of moot.)</p>\n\n<p>The portions of ancestral lands were parceled out in big chunks to each tribe. That means you'd have, eh, let's call it 1000 acres, each acre belonging to one member of the tribe Zebulon. If Joe Zebulon dies and leaves only a daughter, she inherits that acre; if that daughter marries Bob the Reubenite, then their (Reubenite) children will inherit that acre. That means you could have one \"Reubenite\" property in the middle of a giant block of Zebulonite properties. Not a big deal.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=36\" rel=\"nofollow\">last chapter of the book of Numbers</a> actually addresses this situation; the first generation entering Israel had a tricky legal status as they were trying to map to the population one generation prior (i.e. those who exited Egypt); therefore female heiresses then had to marry within their tribe. The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/bababathra/bababathra_120.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Bathra 120</a>-<a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/bababathra/bababathra_121.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">121</a>) makes it clear that this was a temporary restriction on that generation -- once the land was parceled out, it could change hands.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In addition, after the story of Pilegesh Begiv'ah there was a restriction against marrying any boy of the tribe Binyomin until it was nullified. See Shoftim (Judges) chapter 21.</p>\n\n\n",

Yet I've always been told that this is not true for a Torah scroll. Why the difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Wow, I was fascinated by the question, so I looked it up...</p>\n\n<p>First, an introduction of a central concept: There is a disagreement that wends through the Talmud (like Sanhedrin 4a,b) regarding the words of a Torah scroll whether \"Yesh Aim leMikrah\" or \"Yesh Aim leMesoret\". Roughly translated, that means \"Primacy is given to how it is read\" or \"Primacy is given to the Tradition\". So, for example, the Torah says not to cook a kid BCHLV IMO. Without a Tradition, you might read that as BeCHeLeV IMO, in its mother's fats. The Tradition tells us to read it BaCHaLeV IMO, in its mother's milk. Should we give more legitimacy to the first interpretation unless we have a special indication that only the Tradition applies? Or should we work with the Traditional reading unless there is a special reason to consider the simple reading as well? </p>\n\n<p>Now, to begin the answer...\nThe prohibition of using a Sefer Menukad (vowelized scroll) in Shulchan Aruch is in YD 274:7, and in the Ta\"z 6 & 7. For simplicity though, I'm translating Keset HaSofer 16:6: \"A vowelized Torah Scroll is <em>pasul</em> because we have established that 'Primacy is given to the Tradition', and once it's vowelized there is only 'how it is read' [which is to be secondary].  And even if they should remove the vowelization, it remains <em>pasul</em>! Since the intention of the scribe was that he was unconcerned about the Tradition but only to 'how it is read', and for this purpose he wrote it, it is as if the document condemns itself as a forgery (\"Mezuyaf miTocho\"). [Ta\"z]  But had the Torah Scroll already been written properly, and then they added vowels or cantillations, scratching out would help as it does by other errors...\"</p>\n\n<p>The rules for writing Megillot are in OC 691. Law 9 simply reads, \"A Megillah that is vowelized, and similarly if on the first page are written the blessings and poems, is not disqualified thereby.\" No explanation is given to the difference, as if it were self-explanatory.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, the difference is the Torah Scroll's requirement to conform 100% to the Mesoret, the Tradition from Moshe at Sinai through Ezra, whereas the primary requirement of the Megillah is to be read properly, and if the vowels help, so be it...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does 'sharpening' depend on effort, and memorization on divine assistance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>Bavli</em>, <em>M'gila</em> 6 <em>amud</em> 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר ר׳ יצחק אם יאמר לך אדם יגעתי ולא מצאתי אל תאמן לא יגעתי ומצאתי אל תאמן יגעתי ומצאתי תאמן הני מילי בדברי תורה אבל במשא ומתן סייעתא הוא מן שמיא ולדברי תורה לא אמרן אלא לחדודי אבל לאוקמי גירסא סייעתא מן שמיא היא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my own translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Rabbi <em>Yitzchak</em> said:<blockquote>If a man tells you 'I have toiled but not attained', do not believe; 'I have not toiled and have attained', do not believe; 'I have toiled and attained', believe.</blockquote>These words speak of Torah: but business is help from Heaven. And [even] about Torah, they speak of nought but sharpening: but to establish text is help from Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לאוקמי גירסא — שלא תשתכח ממנו / <em>to establish text</em> — so it not be forgotten by him</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seemingly, one gets help from Heaven (or doesn't) in memorization; a more keen, penetrating comprehension depends on one's effort.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Effort <em>can</em> be expended on memorization; as one example of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/25582\">many</a>, people would study <em>mishnayos</em> with a tune in order to more easily memorize them (per <em>Tosafos</em> to <em>M'gila</em> 32 <em>amud</em> 1). And divine assistance <em>can</em> aid keen comprehension, of course. So why does memorization depend on divine assistance, and keen comprehension on effort?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As much as it is theoretically possible to have divine assistance in keen comprehension, and to invest effort in memorization, memorization is more conceptually linked to divine assistance and keen comprehension is more conceptually linked to effort invested.</p>\n<p>לאוקמא גירסא, to establish the text [in one's mind], is the act of assimilating the information of the Torah, taking the external information of the Torah and assimilating them to one's own databank.  This is an act that is inherently beyond the natural capabilities of human intellect - to grasp Divine wisdom.  R' Yaakov Weinberg explained that this is the implication of the statement חכמה באומות תאמין תורה באומות אל תאמין - Torah is not a discipline like math or biology or any other area of knowledge, which one learns and then understands.  Torah is fundamentally different than Chochma, wisdom, and has a spiritual nature to it's attainment.  See also the Dover Shalom commentary to Atta Chonantanu.  This knowledge of Divine wisdom requires Heavenly assistance because it is inherently beyond us.</p>\n<p>לחדודי, to clarify and hone the idea, is the person's own input into developing that knowledge.  Rabbeinu Yonah explains that this is the faculty of Binah, to understand something clearly and the reasons behind it to the point that you can extrapolate to those things which follow similar logic and <em>apply the knowledge</em>.  This aspect of wisdom is something that goes according to a person's individual understanding and appreciation of the knowledge, as the Gra\"h writes on <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t2803.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 3</a>:13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותבונה היא מה שמוציא מעצמו מן החכמה</p>\n<p>Understanding is that which the person on his own extracts from the knowledge</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and R' Menachem Mishkalov (student of the Gra\"h) explains the verse כונן שמים בתבונה (Mishlei 3:19):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיינו \"בתבונה\" שאדם מתבונן תמיד ובא אל החכמה על בוריו, זהו חדתין עתיקין ועל ידי זה מתחדש שם, ולכן אמר \"כונן\" - לשון הווה, שהוא תמיד</p>\n<p>\"Tevunah\" is something which is ongoing and constant, because it goes according to each individual, and therefore is referred to in present tense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of coming to a deep understanding, and thereby extrapolating and applying the knowledge, is something conceptually linked to the person's own input and, therefore, his own efforts.  (I think that this is the understanding of that which the Tanya writes that בינה is the internalization of something - when you work on it, and put your own imprint on it through your own effort, it becomes a part of you.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, remembering, acquiring the raw information, is associated with Divine assistance, whereas honing the knowledge and building on it is associated with one's own effort.</p>\n\n\n",

According to that same source, that’s because that represents the nine major components of each Partzuf which is then completed by its tenth — it’s Malchut; or because the word for truth (emet) also has the “the small number gematria” value of 9 (1+40+400=9).</p>\n\n\n",

Because the kavvanot sometimes assume certain variations in the wording and order of prayers as found only in the liturgy of Sephardic Jews, these wordings appear in these manuscripts-- though the manuscripts were written for and used by Ashkenazim.

The Rabbi said that there is much debate on what the Rambam <em>actually</em> held with regards to this i.e. whether he was writing as a response to the Jews of Fez and their 'coerced conversion' at the hands of the Almohads. The Rambam was writing in response to an unnamed chacham who was espousing very harsh claims that these Jews were 'goyim' and would do better not to daven and perform any rituals at all. The Rambam went to Fez, Morocco, (for unknown reasons) in the thick of Almohad control without being subject to the harsh sanctions. His letter (iggeret hashmad) was in response to this chacham. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam made a few major points to this specific community in Fez:</p>\n\n<p>1) Judaism is not all or nothing. Every mitzvah is important regardless of your status. The mitzvah of a tzaddik is important and so to is the sin or a rasha.

The Rambam was reassuring the community to continue practicing Judaism and to not feel the overwhelming guilt that this chacham was placing upon them. [As wfb mentioned above, others disagreed with the conversion and said that it would have been better to have died, because declaring belief in mohammed would be contrary to (at least) the Rambam's 13 ikarim, namely that Moshe's prophecy being infallible.]</p>\n\n<p>3) One cannot slander an entire community.</p>\n\n<p>4) Although the conversion is not ideal, they should at least yearn and try to escape if the time was right and not a danger to their life.

The Rambam doesn't pasken lechatchila what to do in this situation, its a response to a situation; which of course gives rise to this debate in the first place. Some say that within the Mishneh Torah itself it contradicts the Rambam's overtones in this very letter. (see Chaim Soloveitchik as mentioned above)</p>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, I failed to notice, until I began bending into my first bow, that there was a poster on the wall in front of me, and I was bowing directly towards a full-color photo of a giant Buddha idol. I tried to turn away from it, only to realize that I was now facing and bowing toward a photo of some ancient Roman statue. I tried to orient myself between the two, and I closed my eyes for good measure, but what should I have done?</p>\n\n<p>Do these photos actually pose a problem? Does it help to close your eyes? Should I have walked away (after having begun the 'Amidah!), or perhaps changed direction (away from east)? Does it help that my Kavanah was obviously on HaShem and not these pictures?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It is not permitted to daven in front of any picture or mirror, much less a picture of Avodah Zarah.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://nezeryitzchak.blogspot.com/2012/06/question-may-i-daven-facing-picture.html\">Article on this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A quote from <a href=\"http://www.youngisrael.org/content/pdfs/Halacha_Central/Halochoscope/hs12-09a.pdf\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bowing to any picture can raise the specter of avoda zara.

While images that are not solid or embossed do not raise the specter of idols, intrinsically, one should not daven facing them. This applies specifically to cloth items, including the parochess, and to painted walls. The reasons for this are not merely due to the bowing aspect.

They make their first appearance in the Halachic works of Rabbi Moshe Isserlis (the REMA), both in the Darkei Moshe and his gloss on the Shulchan Aruch in Siman 95. He brings this as a “yesh omrim” from the Rokeach and only mentions the three steps forward.  He explains that the reason for the three steps forward is because there are three places in the Tanach which the word “vayigash – to approach” is used regarding prayer, Avraham, Yehuda and Eliyahu.</p>\n<p>Restarting <em>shmoneh esrai</em> would, seemingly, not be considered “vayigash – to approach” being that the \"approach\" already took place and being that these steps do not have their roots in the Talmud it seems that they would be unnecessary in this situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer can perhaps be derived from this din.

Although its not so explicit there that is how others understand him. It seems this din of 3 step back only applies at the end of a proper shmonai esrai without mistakes. In your case you are moving to a new place. I would say it is no different. I like the question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Annulling nedarim on the basis of noladim",
    "content": "# Annulling nedarim on the basis of noladim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to understand the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the Mishna, Nedarim 9:3-4. If you are already familiar with Masekhet Nedarim, you can skip to the fourth paragraph of my question. If not, the following two paragraphs constitute an introduction to this issue:</p>\n\n<p>The first of those two mishnayot concerns the <em>nolad</em>. This is a situation that was not present at the time the person made a vow, the presence of which would have caused him not to make it, but one which later becomes manifest. According to Rabbi Eliezer in Nedarim 9:2, we can annul a vow on the basis of a <em>nolad</em>. In one of the examples that he gives, if a person were to vow never to enter a particular building, and if that building were later to be made into a synagogue, the fact that he would not have made the vow had he known that it were going to become a synagogue means that (according to Rabbi Eliezer) the vow can be retroactively annulled. The sages disagree, since the building was not actually a synagogue at the time of the vow.</p>\n\n<p>In mishna 9:3, Rabbi Meir declares that there are some things that are like a <em>nolad</em> without actually being a <em>nolad</em> at all. In the examples that he brings, it appears that the reason they are not really <em>noladim</em> lies in the fact that the one making the vow stipulates a reason explicitly; what makes them look like <em>noladim</em> is the fact that the reason later becomes untrue. By stipulating the reason, it is as though he is placing a condition on the vow, and since the condition is no longer existent the vow is invalid. For example, if he declares that he will not marry a certain woman because her father is wicked, and her father subsequently dies, Rabbi Meir permits his marrying the woman since his phrasing of the vow made the reason look like a condition that needed to be met for the vow to be in effect.</p>\n\n<p>The phraseology of mishna 9:3 is such that it would suggest that Rabbi Meir agrees with the sages: one cannot annul a vow if the reason for its annulment is a [true] <em>nolad</em>. Where he disagrees with them here (if indeed he does; there are different <em>girsaot</em>) is in suggesting that this particular situation is permissible because it's not <em>really</em> a <em>nolad</em>; it merely looks like one.</p>\n\n<p>Once we have established that Rabbi Meir agrees that one cannot retroactively annul a vow because of a <em>nolad</em>, how do we explain Nedarim 9:4? In this mishna, Rabbi Meir permits one to retroactively annul a vow that concerns a person's relationship with another Jew, by asking whether or not they would have made the vow if they had known that this other person might become poor and be unable to support himself without access to the vower's wealth. The wording is שמא יעני ואין אתה יכול לפרנסו; \"perhaps he will become poor and you will be unable to support him\". The man's response (אלו הייתי יודע שהוא כן לא הייתי נודר; \"had I known that he [could become] this, I would not have vowed\") is very similar to the wording used by Rabbi Eliezer in mishna 2 (אלו הייתי יודע שהוא נעשה בית הכנסת לא הייתי נודר; \"had I known that it could become a synagogue, I would not have made the vow\").</p>\n\n<p>How is it possible to understand Rabbi Meir's opinion in Nedarim 9:4 as <em>not</em> concerning the annulment of a vow on the basis of a <em>nolad</em> (in this case, that the man might become poor)? And if it is impossible to do so, how is it possible to understand Rabbi Meir's opinion in Nedarim 9:3 as permitting such a thing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that the dispute between the sages and Rebbi Eliezer is not surrounding whether one can be release from a vow based on <em>nolad</em>, but rather surrounds the specific cases listed in the <em>Mishna</em>, which occur infrequently (see Ran 64b).</p>\n\n<p>The sages would allow the release of a vow based on <em>nolad</em> so long as the case was one which occurs frequently, but will not allow the release of a vow based on a case of <em>nolad</em> which occurs infrequently, whereas Rabbi Meir would allow the release in an infrequent case.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, when the <em>Mishna</em> says \"<em>nolad</em>\" it is <em>lav davka</em> (not being precise) and in actuality the sages, Rebbi Meir and Rebbi Eliezer all agree that you can release a vow based on <em>nolad</em>. The dispute in the <em>Mishna</em> is only regarding an infrequent case.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is also worth noting the distinction between \"opening\" a vow (ie. a sages makes a declaration that the person is released from his oath) and annulling the vow (ie. in a case of an oath made in error where it is as if there was no vow to begin with and it becomes void automatically without coming before a sage).</p>\n\n<p>According to some Rishonim (notably Rambam) it would seems that in Nedarim 9:3 Rebbi Meir claims that there are some cases which resemble <em>nolad</em> but are in fact cases of oaths made in error and therefore would be annulled automatically, whereas in Nedarim 9:4 Rebbi Meir says that we can <strong>\"open\"</strong> (ie. a sage could release the vow based on the follow, but not that it happens automatically) a vow that concerns a person's relationship with another Jew, by asking whether or not they would have made the vow if they had known that this other person might become poor and be unable to support himself without access to the vower's wealth.</p>\n\n\n",

I could find some debates which were based on Alī ibn Mūsā al-Riḍā(d. 818) a prominent Muslim scholar, reportedly engaged in a\npublic disputation with a Christian patriarch and a Jewish exilarch that is recorded by Abū Jaʿfar Ibn Bābawayh (d. 991/92) in his Kitāb al-Tawḥīd and his <a href=\"http://www.maaref-foundation.com/english/library/hadith/uyun_akhbar_al_reza_1/17.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā</a>. The arguments and modern citations to the verses mentioned in the <a href=\"http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=23350487\" rel=\"noreferrer\">debate are discussed here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the debates and polemics were  written in the form of books, with most of them referring to both Jews and Christians, Famous scholars of important works are  Ibn\nḤazm (Andalusia, d. 1064), al-Qarāfī (Egypt, d. 1285), and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (Syria, d. 1350)  mentioned because of the wealth of polemical detail they provide and because of the influence they had on the development of the genre. The most important tracts by these authors are  Kitābal-Fiṣal fī ʾl-Milal wa-l-Ahwāʾ wa ʾl-Niḥal, Kitāb al-Ajwiba al-fākhira ʿan al-asʾila al-fājira, and Hidāyat al-Ḥayārā fīAjwibat al-Yahūd wa-l-Naṣārā respectively, \nThe polemics center around the theme of Peoples of the Book like in the Quran, refering both the Ahle Kitab as liable for  distortion in meaning and understanding among the masses, hiding testimonies, refusing to accept the abrogation of their scriptures and laws, displaying excessive reverence toward religious Rabbis and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Also, most of These written polemics have in fact been evolved from oral disputations between Jewish Rabbis and Muslim scholars.The Muslim scholar Ibn Saḥnūn of Qayrawan (d. 869) is said to have held a disputation with a learned Jew in Egypt that lasted several hours. It was initially private in nature, but turned into a public event as more and more locals flocked in to witness the account.</p>\n\n<p>More ever during the Islamic golden age, Majlis sessions in which Jews were invited, or at times even summoned, to participate and to argue for their religion were held either in the salons of leading intellectuals or under the auspices and in the presence of members of the ruling elite, such as viziers, governors, sultans, and even caliphs. The famous Fāṭimid vizier Ibn Killis (d. 991), who was himself a convert from Judaism took much interest in arranging such sessions in which mutakallimūn from different faiths participated. The works of Jewish theologians like Samuel ben Hophni and Yūsuf al-Baṣīr (who are both known to have participated in such sessions) and other Rabbanite and Karaite theologians  were in fact written as manuals or guides for participants in such sessions.</p>\n\n<p>The Quran itself is a reflects  the various debates between Jews and Christians and many of the verses reflect on the debates between the prophet and Jewish rabbis.In most of the debates  the arguments are  concerned with the very foundation of the Jewish faith, namely the Torah. And the Jewish Rabbi most often does not bring about rabbinical sources in the arguments. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1g93JOISJM\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here is a video</a> which enacts  the debate documented in the above source, but it should be taken with a grain of salt as it is too localized and is targetted to a persian Shiite audience:</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>According to the historian Bernard Lewis, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jews_of_Islam.html?id=c0S4lOyfKSYC\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Jews of Islam</em></a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In general, Muslim polemicists pay little attention to the relatively\n  insignificant Jew.

It is an Islamic text, and it presents the Islamic arguments stronger than the Jewish ones. The disputation closed when the Muslim scholar likened the manner in which Moses superceded Abraham for the Jews to the manner in which Mohammad ultimately supercedes Moses. He then asks the Jew whom he was questioning whether he has \"given thought to the pursuit of truth and knowledge\", at which point the Jew requests time to think some more about his answers and the debate is brought to a close.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Kaganoff explains that Harav Moshe bases it on four main reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>\"Any substance that an insect processes that is similar to the processing of honey is kosher.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Rav Moshe suggests that, according to the Levush, any product that is not usually referred to by an adjective identifying its source will be kosher.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>\"'Kol hayotzei min hatamei tamei' applies only when the non-kosher animal creates food. However, when the item created is not food, the product created by a non-kosher source is considered kosher. Thus, he concludes that since shellac is tasteless, it is not considered a food, and is permitted, even though it is yotzei min hatamei.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Since shellac is not food and it is dissolved in a few times its volume of alcohol, it is therefore bateil.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now I was reading a label of a Kosher candy which has in it \"Confectioners glaze - non alcoholic\". I was wondering if anyone knows how this glaze is processed, and if it is also from insect-based shellac. Even if it is from the lac insect there are still the other three reasons of Rav Moshe, however perhaps if it is non alcoholic it is manufactured from a totally different source? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is an alternative, corn-based product called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zein\">zein</a>\" that, according to the linked WP article at least, \"may be labeled as 'confectioner's glaze.'\" According to an email I received from someone in the Hashgacha industry, zein coatings, unlike shellac coatings, \"generally do not contain alcohol.\"</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if this was the product used in your candy; you may be able to determine that by contacting the manufacturer or the kosher certifying agency. But if it was, then the problem of derivation from insect sources doesn't arise.</p>\n\n\n",

This indeed is the basis of the entire Torah — as the Alter Rebbe continues:</p>\n<p>This is what Hillel the Elder meant when he said in regard to the fulfillment of this commandment, \"This is the whole Torah, whilst the rest is but commentary,\" and so on. <strong>For the basis and root of the entire Torah are to raise and exalt the soul high above the body, reaching unto the Source and Root of all the worlds, and also to bring down the blessed light of the En Sof upon the community of Israel, as will be explained later, i.e. into the fountain-head of the souls of all Israel, to become \"One into One.\"</strong> This is impossible if there is, G-d forbid, disunity among the souls, for the Holy One, blessed be He, does not dwell in an imperfect place, as we pray: \"Bless us, O our Father, all of us together, with the light of Thy countenance,\" as has been explained at great length elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphsis mine)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi (Shabbat 31 s.v. d'alakh) explains (in his first explanation) that Hillel's statement in light of <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2827.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs (27:10)</a> which refers to not forsaking the one who is your friend and your father's friend. Rashi understands this as referring to God (see his commentary there). Accordingly, Hillel's intent was that one should please God, just as one would like to be pleased. By identifying the \"friend\" as God, Rashi gets around the issue of the passage being limited to interpersonal mitsvot (<em>bein adam l'havero</em>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Lorberbaum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Lorberbaum</a> explains in Nahalat Yaakov (Leviticus 19:18) that Hillel's response:  דעלך סני לחברך לא תעביד  actually means \n דעלך סני <strong>ו</strong>לחברך, לא תעביד. That is, he was telling the proselyte that the (two-fold) principle that underlies all the mitsvot, is not doing that which is repugnant to us, or to others. The former, includes the mitsvot <em>bein adam lamakom</em> (between man and God) which are for man's benefit, and the latter includes the interpersonal mitsvot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On one foot, the idea is that a person must sensitize him/herself to that which is outside themselves. We need to leave room for the needs of others in our worldview, if we do not do this we won't leave room for God or even our real needs. The entire Torah is about subduing our ego and going against the natural inclination of all animals (humans included) by putting the needs of others into our view.</p>\n\n<p>I will, hopefully, edit this answer soon with a slightly broader explanation and sources.</p>\n\n\n",

At the time of the Beith HaMikdash, there was not necessarily the same emphasis on synagogue participation that there is now, when that's all we have.  It is easy to imagine that the existence of the Beith HaMikdash could have been taken for granted.

Now that everything is so decentralized, it's reversed.  We don't have the Beith HaMikdash, so we bring everything we can from it into our daily lives so that we don't lose it.

    "content": "# How are pre-creation >4000 BCE human civilization and pre-flood >2300 BCE civilizations that continued reconciled with Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How does human history fit in with the Torah's timeline? (This is not about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/792/1947\">why the universe and Earth look so old</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>There is extensive evidence of a human population and human civilizations from well before 4000 BCE (i.e. 6000 years ago, there were more than two humans). Human fossils (that is to say Homo sapiens as opposed to other hominids that existed around and well before this time) and artifacts dating back as far as 200,000 years have been found in Africa, Eurasia, and Australia, and more recent artifacts and fossils (still tens of thousands of years old) have been found in the Americas. Egyptian pyramids (and proto-pyramids) were built both before and after the time of the Mabul (Noah's flood) (confirmed by carbon dating) as well as other Mesopotamian and Indus writing forms that are found to be both from before and after the time of the Mabul, as well as proto-Chinese characters that pose evidence of a single evolving culture that spans pre-Creation, pre-Flood, post-Flood, and modern day China. These are just some examples I've found when attempting to research early human history. I can edit this question with sources detailing as much evidence of this as is requested (Update: some of the evidence is at the bottom of this question post<sup>[*]</sup>), or I can reference you to Google to find <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_world\" rel=\"noreferrer\">encyclopedia articles</a> and scholarly journals or the <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Smithsonian's Human Origins Program</a> or something, or we can proceed with the assumption that this is in fact almost universally accepted as confirmed and consistant records of human history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anyway, I'm having a hard time reconciling this account of human civilization that, which extends well before Creation and continues steadily even through the time of the Mabul, with the Torah, which has Adam and Chava as the first humans and emphatically says that all the earth, the highest mountains, were covered, and all human life was wiped out besides those eight individuals on the ark.</strong> Here are the possibilities I can personally think of or that have been suggested to me with varying levels of support from authoritative sources, but none of them so far work for me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Archeologists and anthropologists (as well as geologists, physicists, cosmologists, biologists, geneticists, and any other line of empirical scientific knowledge that separately and consistently supports it) are part of a massive anti-religious conspiracy. <strong>However</strong> I think such a massive conspiracy theory is untenable and has not been demonstrated.</p></li>\n<li><p>Archeologists and anthropologists are all a victim of misinformation as during and before the Mabul, life on Earth was so different as to systematically confuse all methods of dating. <strong>However</strong> this also doesn't make sense to me, as a systematic alteration of evidence that still leaves all lines of evidence pointing in the same way is implausible, and it also is inconsistent with evidence of an old universe that is external to earth. And what's more, if you can only rely on dating from post-Mabul organic matter, then consider this: If the pyramids were exclusively of a post-Mabul society, you should find neither king lists about pre-flood kings of Egypt nor the C14 dating of organic matter found in or with the pyramids which date to before the flood. One way or another the pyramids are from before the flood (and civilization there and around the world continues like normal).</p></li>\n<li><p>Hashem wanted to make everything look completely natural so he made Earth with a history. <strong>However</strong>, while that might be in line with the premise of my question, that doesn't really do anything to reconcile the idea with what we know about the Torah and Judaism. It's also a little troubling because maybe Hashem would similarly want to make the Exodus from Egypt natural in reality but miraculous in text, and so we shouldn't necessarily expect there to be external evidence of that either. Worse, you cannot say this without painting Hashem as deceitful <strong>unless</strong> it can be <em>clearly</em> demonstrated from the intended meaning of Talmudic or similar sources that Adam <em>wasn't</em> the first man and that the Mabul <em>didn't</em> wipe out any civilizations. And to my knowledge that is not the case. The closest I've come to that was hearing a reference to 974 worlds or generations before ours, but that is insufficiently clear, and when I tried to dig deeper all I found was a Beraisa in <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/chagigah/points/cg-ps-014.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chagigah 14a</a> about them being generations that were not created, but instead that their souls are the wicked among actual generations. And I have also seen reference to <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/zevachim/points/zv-ps-113.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zevachim 113</a> to say that there is precedent to say the flood was not completely global, but all it brings is a single opinion that makes the exception only for Eretz Yisrael and even then says that everyone there died. That is to say, even in this interpretation, which is just based on a textual inference (and doesn't reject the meaning), all cultures, and most evidence of most of the world, would still have been destroyed in the flood.</p></li>\n<li><p>As referenced in part of my discussion on theory #3 above, this Earth had hundreds of \"worlds\" living on it before hand and Hashem destroyed them all in preparation of this world. <strong>However</strong>, while I have heard this claim, I couldn't find anything to back up that such worlds were literally created in a sequential natural form that mirrors the observed natural formation of the solar system and life. The best I found (which is not to say it is good) is <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/tp/i/moha/48931772.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">an article from Aish</a> that takes the words of Rav Abahu and allows for a vague inference that they did exist on a previous version of this planet that was destroyed to the point it was formless yet still maintains a coherent line of archaeological evidence of human civilization. But that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps Aish meant that in some early period of the sixth day there were (somehow and for some reason? I couldn't really follow what they were trying to say) precursors to humans without souls. I'm not sure that there's any basis or explanation for the practical distinction for that. (I'm also incredulous to the possibility that Hashem would in this way need to make so many living beings and people only to kill them in the process of making Earth, especially when only to recreate everything in six days anyway.) <strong>In any event</strong> it only could explain the difference between the first six days of creation with human history older than 6,000 years ago without addressing the events that followed like the Mabul.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/sam/48951136.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A suggestion by Dr. Gerald Schroeder</a>, who says time, from the point of view of Earth, slowed down dramatically from the point of view of Hashem (who is assumed to have the same time perspective as background radiation), and it is in some particular way calculated that the first day of creation was exactly 8 billion years, the second day 4 billion, and so on. And that this supports an old age of the universe and the formation of the solar system and life over long periods of time. <strong>However</strong> as far as I can tell, from a perspective of physics, Schroeder is alone in this understanding, and as far as I can tell the same can be said of the Torah perspective. And it would go against the principle that the Torah is written in the language of man. And it contradicts the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe\" rel=\"noreferrer\">more recent improvements to the estimate of the age of the universe</a>. Schroeder made his calculation around the turn of the century, a clear demonstration that he just was working backwards and has no actual basis. His calculation also contradicts <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_time_scale\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the order and time that various aspects of the universe, solar system, and life developed</a>. And as is the case with suggestion #4, this <strong>only</strong> addresses human history before 6,000 years ago, so this also fails to answer my question.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So as you can see I'm having trouble figuring this out. <strong>What is a good explanation to deal with human history as stated in the Torah and human history as implied by the physical evidence?</strong> Presumably such a reconciliation must exist, and though I've seen many suggestions, none really appear to hold water (no pun intended).</p>\n\n<p>Update: It appears that the best answers have basically argued by changing what the Torah meant, saying it is in some way allegorical. So, yes, this would resolve the contradiction in theory, but I cannot accept those answers without addressing specific improvements: I require a citation from specific people that clearly say this, preferably older answers based on messorah and not answers that were forced to bend around a context of archeological evidence. I need you to demonstrate why your approach is acceptable, in the face of the apparent meaning and tradition, how you know that such a large reinterpretation is acceptable in light of some rishonim like the Rashba and Meiri explicitly not allowing this and even the Rambam being very tempered and suggesting you must believe that Adam was the first man (<a href=\"http://machzikeihadas.blogspot.com/2009/04/critique-of-rabbi-jeremy-weiders-when.html?m=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as discussed here</a>). (If you reference people like Slifkin who bend Torah around science, go further and quote the relevant things they've said along with the older sources they're basing themselves on that allow for such bending.) I also need you to explain where the cutoff is (Are nations descended from those on the ark allegory too? At what point does the genealogy transition to fact?). And I do not require, but would appreciate, at least some kind of feasible theory to explain what the point of those allegories might possibly be.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[*] See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_buildings_in_the_world#By_age\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_buildings_in_the_world#By_age</a> for buildings predating the flood (anything older than c.2270 BCE).

It is clear that various archeological dating methods all show the same thing. I welcome anyone who finds this insufficient to do further research. Mainstream archeology unanimously agrees on this history, and the geological evidence (which would be another extensive set of references) also makes more sense in context of a (relatively) old human history. Unless there is a compelling argument for why all of archeology is wrong, I am not asking if these people existed before Creation and through the Mabul, I'm simply asking how can this be reconciled.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>R' Aryeh Kaplan z'l teaches as follows:</p>\n\n<p>R' Nehunia ben Hakana brings in Sefer Temuna that there are larger shmita cycles of 7000 years each, of which we are now in the 6th, putting the age of the earth at 42,000 years old.</p>\n\n<p>Midrash states that a \"Divine day\" is like 1000 years.

As is the existence of human beings prior to the date Adam was created according to Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Another approach is to look at people like Dr Schroder in Genesis and the Big-Bang who argue that as space-time expands from the point of view of a person standing one earth in 2013 the earth appears billions of years old, however, if you were standing and looking from the point of view of the big bang the universe would seem to be a mere 5773 (almost 4) years old.</p>\n\n<p>ספר אמונות ודעות - מאמר שביעי - אות א</p>\n\n<p>אומר תחלה, כי מן הידוע באמתות הדברים שכל דבר שנמצא במקרא הרי הוא כפשוטו, זולתי מה שאי אפשר לפרשו כפשוטו מחמת אחת מארבע סבות, או מפני שהחוש דוחה אותו, כעין אמרו ויקרא האדם שם אשתו חוה כי היא היתה אם כל חי, והרי רואים אנו השור והאריה שאינם ילודי אשה, לכן צריך שנדע שאין הדבר אמור אלא בבני אדם. או שהשכל דוחה אותו, כאמרו כי ה' אלהיך אש אכלה הוא אל קנא, והרי האש ברואה וזקוקה [לחומר] ופעמים נכבית, ואין השכל מקבל שיהא הוא כך, ולכן מוכרח שתהא מלה נסתרת בלשון שנקמתו כאש אכלה, וכמו שנאמר כי באש קנאתי תאכל כל הארץ.</p>\n\n<p>And so I declare, first of all, that it is a well known fact that every statement found in the Bible is to be understood in its literal sense <strong>except for those that cannot be so construed for one of the following four reasons.</strong> It may, for example, <strong>be rejected by the observation of the senses,</strong> such as the statement, “And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living” (Gen. 3:20), <strong>whereas we see that the ox and the lion are not the offspring of womankind. Hence we must conclude that the implication of the statement embraces human descendants only.</strong> *<em>Or else the literal sense may be neglected by reason such as that of the statement,</em>* “For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God” (Deut. 4:24). Now fire is something created and defective, for it is subject to extinction. Hence it is logically inadmissible that God resemble it. We must, therefore, impute to this statement the meaning that God’s punishment is like a consuming fire, in accordance with the remark made elsewhere in Scripture, “For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy (Zeph. 3:8)</p>\n\n<p>ספר מורה נבוכים - חלק ב פרק כה</p>\n\n<p>דע כי אין בריחתנו מן המאמר בקדמות העולם מפני הכתובים אשר באו בתורה בהיות העולם מחודש - כי אין הכתובים המורים על חידוש העולם יותר מן הכתובים המורים על היות האלוה גשם; ולא שערי הפרוש סתומים בפנינו ולא נמנעים לנו בענין חידוש העולם, אבל היה אפשר לנו לפרשם, כמו שעשינו בהרחקת הגשמות; ואולי זה היה יותר קל הרבה, והיינו יכולים יותר לפרש הפסוקים ההם ולהעמיד קדמות העולם, כמו שפרשנו הכתובים והרחקנו היותו ית' גשם. ואמנם הביאונו שלא לעשות זה ושלא נאמינהו - שתי סיבות. האחת מהם - שהיות האלוה בלתי גוף התבאר במופת, ויתחיב בהכרח שיפורש כל מה שיחלוק על פשוטו המופת, ויודע שיש לו פרוש בהכרח; וקדמות העולם לא התבאר במופת, ואין צריך שיודחו הכתובים ויפורשו מפני הכרעת דעת שאפשר להכריע סותרו בפנים מן ההכרעות; וזה - סיבה אחת. והסיבה השנית - כי האמיננו שהאלוה בלתי גשם לא יסתור לנו דבר מיסודי התורה, ולא יכזיב מאמר כל נביא, ואין בו אלא מה שיחשבו הפתאים שבזה כנגד הכתוב - ואינו כנגדו, כמו שבארנו, אבל הוא כונת הכתוב! אבל אמונת הקדמות על הצד אשר יראה אותו אריסטו, שהוא על צד החיוב, ולא ישתנה טבע כלל ולא יצא דבר חוץ ממנהגו - הנה היא סותרת הדת מעיקרה, ומכזבת לכל אות בהכרח, ומבטלת כל מה שתיחל בו התורה או תפחיד ממנו - האלוהים, אלא יפורשו האותות גם כן, כמו שעשו בעלי התוך מן הישמעאלים ויצאו בזה למין מן ההזיה. אמנם אם יאמן הקדמות לפי הדעת השני אשר בארנונו - והוא דעת אפלטון - והוא, שהשמים גם כן הוים נפסדים - הדעת ההוא לא יסתור יסודי התורה ולא תמשך אחריו הכזבת האותות, אבל העברתם, ואפשר שיפורשו הכתובים על פיו, וימצאו לו דמיונות רבות בכתובתי ה'תורה' וזולתם, שאפשר להתלות בהם, וגם יהיו לראיה. אבל אין ההכרח מביא אותנו לזה, אלא אם התבאר הדעת ההוא במופת; אמנם כל עת שלא יתבאר במופת, לא זה הדעת ניטה אליו, ולא הדעת ההוא גם כן נביט אליו כלל, אבל נבין הכתובים כפשוטיהם, ונאמר, כי התורה הגידתנו ענין, לא יגיע כוחנו להשגתו, והאות מעיד על אמיתת טענותינו:</p>\n\n<p><strong>WE do not reject the Eternity of the Universe, because certain passages in Scripture confirm the Creation; for such passages are not more numerous than those in which God is represented as a corporeal being;</strong> nor is it impossible or difficult to find for them a suitable interpretation. We might have explained them in the same manner as we did in respect to the Incorporeality of God. We should perhaps have had an easier task in showing that the Scriptural passages referred to are in harmony with the theory of the Eternity of the Universe if we accepted the latter, than we had in explaining the anthropomorphisms in the Bible when we rejected the idea that God is corporeal. For two reasons, however, we have not done so, and have not accepted the Eternity of the Universe. First, the Incorporeality of God has been demonstrated by proof: <strong>those passages in the Bible, which in their literal sense contain statements that can be refuted by proof, must and can be interpreted otherwise.</strong> <em>But the Eternity of the Universe has not been proved; a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text, and explaining it figuratively, when the opposite theory can be supported by an equally good argument.</em>\nSecondly, our belief in the Incorporeality of God is not contrary to any of the fundamental principles of our religion: it is not contrary to the words of any prophet. Only ignorant people believe that it is contrary to the teaching of Scripture: but we have shown that this is not the case: on the contrary, Scripture teaches the Incorporeality of God. If we were to accept the Eternity of the Universe as taught by Aristotle, that everything in the Universe is the result of fixed laws, that Nature does not change, and that there is nothing supernatural, we should necessarily be in opposition to the foundation of our religion, we should disbelieve all miracles and signs, and certainly reject all hopes and fears derived from Scripture, unless the miracles are also explained figuratively. The Allegorists amongst the Mohammedans have done this, and have thereby arrived at absurd conclusions. If, however, we accepted the Eternity of the Universe in accordance with the second of the theories which we have expounded above (ch. xxiii.), and assumed, with Plato, that the heavens are like wise transient, we should not be in opposition to the fundamental principles of our religion: this theory would not imply the rejection of miracles, but, on the contrary, would admit them as possible. The Scriptural text might have been explained accordingly, and many expressions might have been found in the Bible and in other writings that would confirm and support this theory. But there is no necessity for this expedient, so long as the theory has not been proved. As there is no proof sufficient to convince us, this theory need not be taken into consideration, nor the other one: we take the text of the Bible literally, and say that it teaches us a truth which we cannot prove: and the miracles are evidence for the correctness of our view.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The question seems to be bothered by the issue that archeological records show that people were around much more than 6000 years ago while the genealogy in the Bible would place Adam, the first man, more recently. </p>\n\n<p>There are many ways of addressing this. Just as the six days can be explained as not literally being six days, one can explain that the first man existed much more than 6000 years ago. One can also say that Adam the person wasn't actually the father of all mankind (but of a significant group in the area). Rishonim such as the Rambam already discussed the story of Adam as an allegory, so this isn't such a critical issue. </p>\n\n<p>The archeological record may show some evidence for a large flood, but not one that wiped out all of civilization and animals on the entire planet. But the flood story can be understood as being a regional flood and one may not need to interpret every detail of the story literally. </p>\n\n<p>Some people have explained that the Torah is focused on theological issues, and may not be trying to give an exact description of pre-history. Others have expanded the concept of “dibbera Torah ki-leshon benei adam\" to explain why the Torah may have presented early stories in a non-scientific  manner. </p>\n\n<p>Update: See also some of these articles from Tradition:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there Science in the Bible? An Assessment of Biblical Concordism by David Shatz</li>\n<li>When Torah and Science Collide by Nathan Aviezer</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.traditiononline.org/news/_pdfs/0041-0048.pdf\">A Note on The Flood Story in the Language of Man</a> by Joel Wolowelsky </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See also books on this topic, e.g. The Challenge of Creation, by Natan Slifkin. </p>\n\n<p>Update 2:\nThe Rambam did not take the \"6 days\" of Bereishis literally, as well as other details. See <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp117.htm\">More Nevuchim II:30</a>. (C.f. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegorical_interpretations_of_Genesis#Rabbinic_teachings\">Wikipedia</a>, though it needs some editing and citations.) Also, I don't see what's wrong with re-interpreting something based on archeology. What matters is whether it's a reasonable (or plausible) interpretation, not what motivated it. See the Ramban on the Rainbow (Bereishis 9:12) where he re-interprets a phrase based on the Greeks' explanation of rainbows as a natural phenomena. (He then realizes that this reading actually fits quite well with the text!)</p>\n\n<p>More can be said about these specific issues, but יש לו סוד, and the basic idea is to realize the goal of the Torah is to teach the Mitzvoth and certain hashkafic principles. The simple literal meaning of Bereishis is not there to give an fully-detailed historical account of the development of the world from the first moment until Avraham. </p>\n\n\n",

(I note the whole basis of the question is that in the days when women regularly or even semi-regularly were involved in handling sanctified food, such a purification was clearly performed. Nowadays that is not an issue [with the possible exception of women who would visit the outer parts of the Temple Mount].)

The implication is that the longstanding custom was for women to not visit the Mikva outside the context of a \"kosher\" sexual relationship.

And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 37 And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, making the white appear which was in the rods. 38 And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink. 39 And the flocks conceived at the sight of the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Jacob got all the black goats.</li>\n<li>Laban hide all the black and spotted goats (verse 36)</li>\n<li>So Jacob started off with pure white goats (or sheep?)</li>\n<li>Jacob's technique turn the newborn goats spotted</li>\n<li>Is the term for goats similar to sheep?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let me try to understand</p>\n\n<p>Do I get this right?

And therefore G-d changed the colors/patterns of the animals, even after they had been born! \nThe only reason Yakov needed the sticks at all, was not so that the right colors/patterns would give birth, but rather that he was obligated to watch out for the wellbeing of the herd for Lavan, in that he had accepted a gaurdianship position which has legal obligations, and as such when lavan had removed parts of the flock, the sex drive of the animals was lowered and hence the colored sticks to increase drive.

(mentioned in Kings II chap. 22, and Chronicles II chap. 34), in the course of renovations to the Temple. (If I'm mistaken, please cite a source).</p>\n\n<p>You are quite correct that there were many copies of the Torah. This particular scroll was unique because it was written by Moses' hand (see Chronicles) -- the one in which Moses recorded the Torah as it was dictated to him by Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Yoshiyau tore his clothes in fear on hearing about it, because it was opened to the section in Deuteronomy of the punishments, particularly 28:36 - \"Hashem will lead you and the king which you will set over you to a nation which neither you or your forefathers know\" (free translation) (see Yoma 52b).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a fundamental question that affects the authenticity of our entire mesorah. I have spent a long time researching this topic and believe that the approach I’ve developed is strong, clear, and self-evident.  Here are a few important points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Nowhere in the text does it say that the Torah had been lost and rediscovered.</strong>\nThis is merely an interpretation that some have read into the narrative to explain the events. The <strong>pesukim</strong> themselves do not say that the Torah was missing or forgotten.</li>\n<li><strong>The Navi assumed that the readers were already familiar with the Chumash</strong>, and therefore did not feel the need to explain what would have been obvious to them. Anyone who has read Parshas Vayeilech (Devarim 31:19–29) knows that <strong>the Sefer Torah written by Moshe was to be kept in the Mishkan/Mikdash as a witness against the Jewish people</strong>, to warn them of the punishments that would come if they sinned.\nTherefore, <strong>it is entirely understandable that Yoshiyahu would be shocked and afraid</strong> if this very Sefer — the very item designated as a witness against the people of the consequences of national sin — suddenly emerged. The fear was not from the mere existence of the Sefer, but from the confrontation with its message.</li>\n<li><strong>This reading is clearly supported by the context.</strong>\nIf you continue reading in Melachim II (22:13–16), it’s evident that the entire discussion following the discovery focuses on the tochacha (rebuke and warning in the Torah). Similarly, in Divrei HaYamim II (34:14), it tells us that Chilkiyahu HaKohen found \"the Sefer Torah of Hashem by the hand of Moshe,\" which fits very well with what we said above that this was the sefer that Moshe had commanded be kept in the Beis Hamikdash. (I believe that the Rashba and Abarbanel make these points)</li>\n<li><strong>Chazal also support this view.</strong>\nThe Yerushalmi tells us that the Sefer Torah was found rolled to the tochacha. Most Rishonim explain the episode accordingly: the Sefer was found rolled up to a terrifying section, which gave it an additional urgency and relevance.</li>\n<li><strong>From a historical perspective, it’s unlikely the Torah had been truly forgotten.</strong>\nDuring the reign of Chizkiyahu, it's clear that the Torah was known and observed — for example, see Divrei HaYamim II 30:16. He was succeeded by his wicked son Menashe, who ruled for 55 years but eventually did <strong>teshuvah</strong> and attempted to restore proper service of Hashem (Divrei HaYamim II 33:12–16). He was followed by Amon, who reigned for just two years, and then by Yoshiyahu, who began seeking out Hashem already in his eighth year (Divrei HaYamim II 34:3). The Sefer Torah was discovered in <strong>the eighteenth year</strong> of his reign.\nSo, from the death of Chizkiyahu until the Torah was found was around <strong>70 years</strong>. And that’s being generous. Realistically, the Torah would not have disappeared the moment Menashe took power, and he later tried to bring people back to it. Furthermore, Yoshiyahu had already begun a process of spiritual revival <strong>ten years</strong> before the Sefer was found. So the actual window of neglect was much shorter.\nAnd <strong>even if it had been 70 years, that is not long enough for the Torah to be forgotten</strong>. Just as we see in Ezra 3:12 that elders remembered the First Beis HaMikdash after 70 years of exile, it’s entirely logical that elders in Yoshiyahu’s time still remembered Torah from the days of Chizkiyahu as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The idea that the Torah was lost for generations and only rediscovered in Yoshiyahu’s time is not only unsupported by the text — it is deeply problematic for our understanding of Jewish history and mesorah. The <strong>context of the pesukim</strong>, Chazal, Rishonim, and historical context all point to a very different, far more compelling explanation: <strong>the Torah was never lost.</strong>  The Torah is an eternal relationship that we have been given with Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

Whether the editor had access to these \"chronicles,\" as they were deposited in the state archives, or simply to a history based upon them, can not with certainty be determined.

Earlier in the Gemara, Abayei discusses a somewhat similar case (Davidson Edition translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה ר' חנינא בר מניומי לאביי עציץ שאינו נקוב מהו אי לא נקוב הא לא נקוב</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Minyumi said to Abaye: In a case of a flowerpot [atzitz] that is not perforated, what is the halakha with regard to separating teruma and tithes? Abaye replied: What is the difficulty here? If it is not perforated, this halakha is the same as that of any non-perforated flowerpot, i.e., the separation of teruma and tithes is required by rabbinic law.</p>\n  \n  <p>דלמא חזר ונקבו קא אמרת</p>\n  \n  <p>Abaye continues: Perhaps what you meant to say is that he subsequently went and perforated it. In such a case the question is whether one may separate teruma and tithes from the initial growth of the plant. Is the initial growth considered a separate entity, in which case one part of the growth requires the separation of teruma and tithes by rabbinic law and the rest by Torah law, and therefore one may not separate from the initial growth? Alternatively, perhaps the initial growth is nullified by the subsequent growth, which would mean that the obligation of teruma and tithes applies to the entire plant by Torah law. Consequently, this obligation can be fulfilled by separating teruma and tithes from the initial growth of the plant. This would be similar to Rabba’s dilemma with regard to an ear of grain that is replanted.</p>\n  \n  <p>הכא חדא זריעה היא איחבורי הוא דקא מיחברא ועולה התם שתי זריעות נינהו</p>\n  \n  <p>Abaye explains that the two cases are not comparable. Here, in the case of the non-perforated flowerpot which was subsequently perforated, it is one single sowing. Therefore, although the original growth occurred while the pot was not perforated, since it is now perforated, the plant is considered attached to the ground and it rises and grows from there. Consequently, the obligation of teruma and tithes applies to the entire plant by Torah law. There, in Rabba’s dilemma involving the replanting of an ear of grain, there are two distinct sowings. Therefore, there is room to debate whether or not the additional, second sowing is part of the original, first sowing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the above, Abayei would hold that one can take Terumah off from the initial growth of the plant.  Therefore, Abayei would understand the answer to Rav Avahu's question to be that it would be terumah while it was still attached to the ground.  Meaning, your explanation of \"Im Kein\" is incorrect, and should read (added parts in italics):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The rabbis told Abaye:</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    \n    <p>If [<em>according to your opinion</em> by naming it t'ruma he in fact made it t'ruma], then we have a case of t'ruma attached to the ground, and tanaim taught \"there is no t'ruma attached to the ground\".</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For your number 2, I see that the Chavrusa Gemara changes the text to אמר להו, \"he said to them\", which would be Abayei to the Rabbis.  However, as pointed out by doubleAA, there is no manuscript evidence to support this in Dikdukei Sofrim. Sefaria simply translates it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abaye said to one of those Sages</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which is the clear meaning from the context.</p>\n\n\n",

I never asked why on a Psak and if I did my Rav would not hesitate to explain. </p>\n\n<p>You say \"The man often asks is there room to be machmir which again the rov doesnt like answering\". Why would anyone be looking for Chumros when it can lead to sinning?</p>\n\n<p>You say \"Often the man goes round asking quite a few rabbonim who may give conflicting replies\". I always go to the same rabbi, never going to a different one unless my Rabbi told me to do so. And that was only when he felt there was room to be lenient yet did not want to take responsibility for it so he told me who to go to who will be lenient. In addition my Rabbi takes away the source of the question and does not give it back to you making it impossible to go to a different Rabbi. If your Rabbi does not do that then I recommend you find one who does.</p>\n\n<p>You say \"There may be questions the rov has to ask which the man may not always know\".

However if one forgot at Shacharis or Mincha he does have to Daven again. This coming month Sivan 5773 the Molad is at 7:49 AM and 16 Chalakim on the actual day of Rosh Chodesh. If one Davens Shacharis at 6 AM prior to the Molad and forgot Yaale V'Yavo would they be required to Daven again since it is during the day or perhaps not since it would not have been Rosh Chodesh yet since it is prior to the Molad?    </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It doesn't seem that there is a connection between the <em>Molad</em> and the sanctification of the month during the day.</p>\n<p>The Talmud in Sanhedrin (11b) relates the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר אין מעברין את השנה אלא ביום ואם עיברוה בלילה אינה מעוברת ואין מקדשין את החדש אלא ביום ואם קידשוהו בלילה אינו מקודש א\"ר אבא מאי קרא תקעו בחדש שופר בכסה ליום חגנו איזהו חג שהחדש מתכסה בו הוי אומר זה ראש השנה וכתיב כי חוק לישראל הוא משפט לאלהי יעקב מה משפט ביום אף קידוש החדש ביום</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: A leap-year is to be declared only by day, and if it has been declared by night, the declaration is invalid. The sanctification of a month is to be performed by day, and if it has been performed by night it is not valid. R. Abba says: What passage [proves this]? — Blow the horn at the new moon, at the covering of the moon our feast-day.  Now on which feast is the moon covered? — We must say on the New Year.  And it is thereupon written, For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob: Just as judgment is executed by day, so also must the sanctification of the month take place by day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, it would seem that the need to sanctify the month during the day is unrelated to the appearance of the <em>molad</em> and therefore according to the reasoning of the Shulchan Aruch that you quoted one would be required to repeat <em>shmoneh esrai</em> if one forgot to insert <em>ya'aleh ve'yavoh</em> even if one originally said it prior to the appearance of the <em>molad</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

My best guess is that the intended meanings are \"Samar sits\" and \"Samar plays [music],\" although neither is written correctly for those meanings, and there are other possibilities. </p>\n\n<p>These sentences remind me vaguely of a Yiddish version of \"Simon says\" in which sentences take the form  \"-- למך\"  (=\"Lemekh (the subject) [does something])\"; you insert the first-person-singular, present-tense verb of your choice in the sentence in order to issue commands to the group.

Rabbi Aivu derives from the pasuk that he ate because she gave it to him. He says, Suhchatuh Anuhvim vinuhsinu lo. The etz hadaas was a grape vine, and Chava squeezed the grapes into grape juice and gave it to him. Thus, he did not know that he was partaking of the forbidden fruit and was therefore acting either out of shogeg or peshiah...</p>\n<p>In contrast, Rabbi Simlai quotes beraishit 3:17 , where Hashem says he will punish Adam Ki shumatu likol ishtechu, vatochal min-hu-etz, “because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the fruit.” Listening to the voice of someone generally means listening to an argument put forth by that person and agreeing to the validity of his or her argument. Thus, according to Rabbi Simlai, this pasuk implies that Chava presented a compelling argument to Adam, and Adam, persuaded by her argument, ate the fruit...</p>\n<p>Finally, the Chachamim disagree with Rabbi Simlai’s understanding of the pasuk Ki shumatu likol ishtechu vatochal min-hu-etz: Rabbi Simlai posited that shumatu likol ishtechu meant listening to Chava’s words, but if so, the pasuk should have said Ki shumatu lidivray ishtechu. Kol implies voice, not words, so the Chachamim claim that Chava began weeping and crying to him until he ate from the etz.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, according to Rabbi Aivu, he did not know.

    "content": "# Why is Avraham's monotheism not mentioned in the torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the more famous achievements of Avraham was his discovery in a single God. However there is no mention of this accomplishment anywhere in the Torah. In fact there is no conclusive proof that he was a monotheist anywhere in the simple text of the Torah. Why is Avraham's discovery and belief in a single God not recorded in the Torah itself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Its strongly implied in Yehoshuah, in his final speech to the people (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0624.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch. 24</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוֹשֻׁעַ אֶל-כָּל-הָעָם, כֹּה-אָמַר יְ'ה'וָה  אֱלֹהֵי\n  יִשְׂרָאֵל, בְּעֵבֶר הַנָּהָר יָשְׁבוּ אֲבוֹתֵיכֶם מֵעוֹלָם, תֶּרַח\n  אֲבִי אַבְרָהָם וַאֲבִי נָחוֹר; וַיַּעַבְדוּ, אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים. \n  וָאֶקַּח אֶת-אֲבִיכֶם אֶת-אַבְרָהָם, מֵעֵבֶר הַנָּהָר, וָאוֹלֵךְ\n  אֹתוֹ, בְּכָל-אֶרֶץ כְּנָעַן; וארב (וָאַרְבֶּה), אֶת-זַרְעוֹ,\n  וָאֶתֶּן-לוֹ, אֶת-יִצְחָק.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Terach served other gods, God took Avraham away from that, which implies that Avraham rejected polytheism and just served God. Yehoshuah then ends off with a choice to the people - do they return to the idolatry of their fathers across the river or do they serve God?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעַתָּה יְראוּ אֶת-יְ'ה'וָה, וְעִבְדוּ אֹתוֹ--בְּתָמִים וּבֶאֱמֶת;\n  וְהָסִירוּ אֶת-אֱלֹהִים, אֲשֶׁר עָבְדוּ אֲבוֹתֵיכֶם בְּעֵבֶר הַנָּהָר\n  וּבְמִצְרַיִם, וְעִבְדוּ, אֶת-יְ'ה'וָה.\n   וְאִם רַע בְּעֵינֵיכֶם לַעֲבֹד אֶת-יְ'ה'וָה, בַּחֲרוּ לָכֶם הַיּוֹם\n  אֶת-מִי תַעֲבֹדוּן--אִם אֶת-אֱלֹהִים אֲשֶׁר-עָבְדוּ אֲבוֹתֵיכֶם אֲשֶׁר\n  בעבר (מֵעֵבֶר) הַנָּהָר, וְאִם אֶת-אֱלֹהֵי הָאֱמֹרִי אֲשֶׁר אַתֶּם\n  יֹשְׁבִים בְּאַרְצָם; וְאָנֹכִי וּבֵיתִי, נַעֲבֹד אֶת-יְ'ה'וָה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The people then affirm they choose 'ה since he is our God:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גַּם-אֲנַחְנוּ נַעֲבֹד אֶת-יְ'ה'וָה, כִּי-הוּא אֱלֹהֵינוּ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First, it should be noted that although the questioner list \"discovery of a single God\" as an achievement of Avraham this is not the case. The Midrashic Literature does indeed teach that Avraham came to the conclusion that the universe has one single Ruler, but this was not a novel idea. Adam HaRishon clearly knew this as he was created and interacted with Hashem, so did his children and the entirety of mankind until the days of Enosh when \"the name of Hashem began to be profaned\" and mankind began to slowly progress toward the mistaken ideology of polytheism and idol worship (see Rambam Hilchos Avodah Zarah), but there were always individuals who maintained the tradition from Adam of the Unity and Oneness of God. The greatness that is ascribed to Avraham is not his <em>discovery</em> of a single God, which would imply that this concept was unknown prior, but rather that he came to this conclusion based on his own searching and striving for truth, whereas all those who came before him merely preserved the knowledge that they had received based on tradition. Avraham was one who strove for truth and therefore was unsatisfied until he had achieved this aim.</p>\n\n<p>The questioner's second contention that there is no record of Avraham's monotheism in the Written Torah is also unfounded. Before bringing scriptural support we must first define the term \"monotheism.\" Does monotheism simply mean not worshiping more than one deity? If so, there were many pagan and polytheistic cults throughout the ages which practiced this type of 'monotheism' - believing that there local deity was the only deity worthy of their sacrifices or affection, or (as a means of political domination) forcing others to adopt the worship of their patron deity. No, simply avoiding the worship of multiple deities is not monotheism. It is a matter of belief. Does the belief that one deity is more powerful than all the others qualify as monotheism? Again, no. There were many pagan cults which we would qualify as polytheistic which held this belief. So then, what does a monotheist believe? Only one deity? What does this mean? What is the definition of a deity? Is it simply a matter of semantics? Is calling the one power which one believes to be supreme \"god\" and calling all the others by another name considered monotheism? If one calls Zeus \"god\" and all the other deities of Olympus \"angels\" is that monotheism? No. Monotheism is the understanding that although there are a myriad of forces, physical and meta-physical, which exist in the world all of the forces have one Creator, one Source, and are sustained by only one Force. That everything in the world is dependent on one and only one Entity. This one Entity is God. This belief is clearly expressed in Genesis 14 by both Malki-Zedek (14:19-20) and Avraham (14:22)</p>\n\n<p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אַבְרָ֖ם אֶל־מֶ֣לֶךְ סְדֹ֑ם הֲרִימֹ֨תִי יָדִ֤י אֶל־יְהוָה֙ אֵ֣ל עֶלְי֔וֹן קֹנֵ֖ה שָׁמַ֥יִם וָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>\n\n<p>Avraham clearly states his belief in one Entity who is the Creator and Source of everything (Shamayim and Aretz)</p>\n\n<p>Now, the question of why Avraham's theological positions and his journey to achieve them are not a focus of the Written Torah is indeed a great one. One which has been pondered by many scholars. I would like to humbly suggest that the rationale of the Written Torah in leaving out this information is because the Book of Genesis is not a book of theology but rather of righteousness. The focus of Genesis, in particular the accounts of the Avos, and in more particular the account of Avraham is about <em>Derech Eretz</em> following the maxim \"<em>Derech Eretz kadma la Torah</em>.\" In fact, Avraham is praised as being one who teaches his household this message:</p>\n\n<p>כִּ֣י יְדַעְתִּ֗יו לְמַעַן֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְצַוֶּ֜ה אֶת־בָּנָ֤יו וְאֶת־בֵּיתוֹ֙ אַחֲרָ֔יו וְשָֽׁמְרוּ֙ דֶּ֣רֶךְ יְהוָ֔ה לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת צְדָקָ֖ה וּמִשְׁפָּ֑ט</p>\n\n<p>One might argue that this is what Rashi is alluding to in his answer to the question of why the entire Book of Genesis is included at all, \"So that the nations of the world will not accuse you of being robbers.\" The entire Book of Genesis is also called \"Sefer HaYashar\" meaning the \"Book of the Upright\" which is a reference to the Avos.</p>\n\n<p>מאי ספר הישר א\"ר חייא בר אבא א\"ר יוחנן זה ספר אברהם יצחק ויעקב שנקראו ישרים\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.25a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a> </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The monotheism of Avraham Avinu was not as opposed to the Christian idea of Trinity. It was as opposed to idol worship. That was the polytheism which existed. Worshiping God is a completely different paradigm from idol worship. The fact that he worshiped God is clear in many places.</p>\n\n<p>His unique achievements are that he came to this conclusion on his own, far from Shem. But more importantly, he actively spread God's name.

This shown us that he did indeed have a unique and new approach. He is the first to introduce Hashem into the world as its immediate, reachable, and personal Boss. This, as opposed to Malki Tzedek who referred to Hashem as the High and Mighty.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it permitted to learn in kollel without earning a living?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2013/05/is-it-better-to-be-supported-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ramoh in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.246.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah, 246:21</a>\n“A person should hire himself out for alien work rather than requiring assistance from others”; “The man who is self-sufficient is greater than the one who fears Heaven”; etc.</p>\n<p>...Here Ramoh drives home this point even further, noting that someone who decides to busy themselves with Torah and live off charity rather than working has desecrated God's Name and brought the Torah into disrepute. He adds that Torah which is not accompanied by work leads to sin and theft (presumably because the Torah scholar/student is incapable of making a living via honest means). Similarly, the Rosh, discussing someone whose Torah is his profession, such that he is exempt from paying various taxes, defines this person as someone who only takes time away from his studies in order to earn a livelihood, “which is his obligation, for the study of Torah with derech eretz is beautiful, and if the Torah is not accompanied by work, it will end in neglect and will cause sin.\" This reflects the normative position amongst the Rishonim in Ashkenaz, where financing Torah study was unheard of; virtually all Torah scholars were self-supporting, and even financing Torah teaching was only reluctantly permitted by some.</p>\n<p>...after stating the primary view, that it is forbidden and wrong for Torah scholars to receive funding, then noting a \"yesh omrim,\" an alternate lenient view that it is permissible for rabbis to receive funding, we finally have a further lenient view that even students may receive funding. However, Ramoh notes that it is still preferable for Torah students to be self-supportive, if possible:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>it would seem that it is problematic for a student to be supported full time in kollel without making any sort of income himself, especially in today's age when there are thousands of people already learning in kollel.</p>\n<p>What then is the halachic basis for someone today to choose to learn in kollel full time without working and rely solely on someone else's support?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://daattorah.blogspot.com/2008/10/kollel-ii-rav-moshe-feinstein.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Moshe Feinstein</a> said that while one can learn that it would be prohibited according to the Rambam, the custom for many generations was to permit it. Therefore, he said that one is allowed to take money either because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Halacha doesn't follow the Rambam</li>\n<li>The Halacha follows the Rambam but the Rambam would allow one to take money if one needs to learn the whole Torah if one would be unable to understand what he learns if he works (though if 1.

According to this approach, not only is it permitted to take money for Kollel, but it would be forbidden to \"be a chossid\" and work, since one cannot learn (properly) and work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, the Ramah says it would be preferable if he could get a good income AND occupy himself in Torah study - but the Ramah concludes that such a scenario is not the norm so (Lehalacha the reverts to the original statement) it goes back to the original Heter.</p>\n\n<p>See the Shach #20 where he elaborates on the importance of such groups so that the Torah should not be forgotten Chas Vesholom.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the claim that there is thousands already learning - what cap should we put on it?
